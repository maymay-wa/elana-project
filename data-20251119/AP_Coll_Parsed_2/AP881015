prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski says 
his new government is less broadly based than he wanted because 
four opposition members refused to join his cabinet 
in my opinion opposition entry into the goverment would have 
changed quite strongly the political situation in poland and 
created a new situation favorable to the idea of national 
reconciliation rakowski said 
rakowski spoke at his first news conference as prime minister 
friday just after the sejm or parliament voted 3631 to approve a 
cabinet made up mostly of members of the ruling polish united 
workers party the communist party 
when asked what role the outlawed trade union solidarity was 
playing rakowski said i dont limit democratization to the 
recognition of solidarity i dont think that the restoration of 
solidarity may be proof of the fact that our country is becoming 
more democratic 
but a catholic deputy said in a parliament speech friday that 
authorities must regard solidarity the first independent union in 
the soviet bloc as a permanent fixture of the political scene 
there is no doubt that union pluralism is today a basic but 
one of the many problems to be solved from the wide package of 
reform which awaits us zygmunt kostarczyk said 
rakowski had left open four cabinet positions for what he called 
members of the constructive opposition but said opposition 
figures refused to join his government 
rakowski said he offered cabinet posts to catholic church 
adviser witold trzeciakowski independent economist julian 
auleytner catholic intellectual andrzej micewski and journalist 
alexander paszynski 
when he was named prime minister sept 27 rakowski said he 
hoped to broaden the communistdominated government and gain 
popular support 
the cabinet which rakowski nominated thursday includes a new 
generation of young party members to oversee economic affairs but 
senior party members retained the key interior defense and foreign 
ministries in all parliament approved nine new ministers 
one of rakowskis chief tasks as prime minister will be to 
revive the failing economy inflation stands at 60 percent 
consumer goods from cheese to winter coats are in short supply and 
workers continue to press for wage increases 
rakowski declined to say exactly when the roundtable talks with 
solidarity and he seemed cautious about the results 
i am against getting excited about the round table he said 
we will see how the first round will go what kinds of positions 
or views will appear 
solidarity was crushed with the imposition of martial law in 
1981 
solidarity leader lech walesa agreed to end a wave of strikes in 
august after the government agreed to roundtable talks on the 
future of solidarity 
in a related development about fifty miners dismissed from 
their jobs after the strikes demonstrated outside the communist 
party headquarters in warsaw friday eyewitnesses said 
they held up banners saying we dont want to overthrow the 
round table we demand only to have our jobs back 
solidarity has said it will discuss dismissals and repression of 
former strikers at the roundtable talks 
rakowski replaced zbigniew messner whose cabinet resigned sept 
19 after criticism for mishandling the partyapproved economic 
reform program it was the first time the entire government stepped 
down in postwar poland

the head of the antidefamation league wants 
the justice department to explain why it did not reveal that 
boleslavs maikovskis allegedly a nazi collaborator fled the 
united states while awaiting deportation to the soviet union 
maikovskis 83 secretly left the united states and is believed 
to be in west germany a government source said friday on condition 
that he not be identified the source said he did not know when 
maikovskis left 
the whole thing is a little bit strange adl national 
director abraham foxman said in a telephone interview from new 
york we are baffled why the secrecy around this issue 
maikovskis a latvian had been living in mineola ny since 
1951 he had been awaiting deportation since 1986 when the supreme 
court turned down his appeal 
maikovskis departure came to light friday after the adl issued 
a press release urging attorney general dick thornburgh to conduct 
an immediate investigation into maikovskis whereabouts and 
prompt action to bring him to justice 
foxman said the adl confirmed thursday that maikovskis was 
missing from his mineola home and called the justice department to 
report it 
they said in confidence they know that hes missing and they 
know where he is foxman said so we said why dont you tell 
the american people they said they cant do that 
foxman then decided to go public with the only information adl 
could confirm that maikovskis was no longer in mineola 
neal sher director of the justice departments office of 
special investigations confirmed that maikovskis had left the 
united states but declined to say where he had gone or how the 
department knew this 
we have just learned after a massive investigation to find 
this guy that in fact he is out of the country and in effect 
the deportation order has been effectuated sher said 
he also said there was nothing further for the justice 
department to investigate his being brought to justice is out of 
our hands sher said 
but foxman said his group wants to know under what circumstances 
maikovskis left when whether he will be brought to trial and 
whether the us government has any agreement with the germans 
sher suggested that the adl deal with german authorities 
maikovskis had been a chief of a nazicreated police force in 
latvia during world war ii he is accused of having ordered the 
mass arrest of residents in the latvian village of audrini and then 
burning the town the 200 villagers were later killed by the nazis 
maikovskis was sentenced to death in absentia in the soviet 
union in 1965 deportation proceedings against maikovskis began in 
the united states in 1976 and dragged on through several appeals 
his deportation was upheld by a federal court of appeals in 1985 
and his final appeal was rejected by the us supreme court in 1986 
maikovskis had designated switzerland as the country to which he 
wanted to be deported but that country refused him and he faced 
deportation to the soviet union 
in fact osi filed papers on oct 7 redesignating the soviet 
union as maikovskis deportation destination sher said but 
maikovskis apparently was already gone by then 
he saw the handwriting on the wall sher said pointing to 
the case of accused nazi collaborator karl linnas who was deported 
last year to the soviet union linnas also of long island died 
before he could be tried 
elan steinberg head of the world jewish congress said 
maikovskis departure was a tribute to osi 
the most important thing we were concerned about was getting 
him out of the country steinberg said

the head of the nuclear regulatory 
commission has apologized to gov michael dukakis top aide on 
atomic power issues who was dragged out of a commission meeting 
after trying to speak from the audience during a discussion on the 
reopening of a massachusetts reactor 
nrc chairman lando w zech jr drafted a letter to peter agnes 
late friday about an hour after the massachusetts assistant public 
safety commissioner was forcibly removed from the nrc hearing room 
zech said he regreted the unfortunate incident explaining 
that he did not recognize agnes 
i hope you understand the need for us to exercise some control 
at our commission hearings so scheduled presentations can be made 
in an orderly manner zech wrote 
agnes who was in the audience stood up while nrc officials 
were telling commissioners that the pilgrim plant in plymouth 
mass was ready to open after a 2year shutdown even though it 
did not have an approved emergency evacuation plan 
agnes who has been working with local and federal officials to 
create acceptable evacuation plans for the suburban towns 
surrounding the plant was immediately approached by several nrc 
security guards 
when he continued to stand and address the commission the 
guards grabbed him by both arms as he yelled that he was tired of 
hearing halftruths agnes was pulled from the row over several 
other spectators and dragged out of the hearing room 
he was not arrested but was barred from the building 
i simply could not sit there any longer after having worked 
on this project for two years with state and local officials and 
hear the falsehoods halftruths and misrepresentations that the 
nrc staff was making about emergency planning it was absolutely 
disgraceful my concern was that we were reaching a decision point 
and that the commissioners ought to know that at least one public 
safety official from the commonwealth took exception with what they 
said agnes said 
the commission declined to make an immediate ruling zech said 
the commission needed time to review testimony presented earlier in 
the day by sen edward m kennedy and other state officials as well 
as the nrc staffs recommendations 
the commission usually does not hear public comment at such 
meetings they made an exception for kennedy lt gov evelyn 
murphy and rep gerry e studds dmass but refused to allow 
other state officials and local residents to speak 
dukakis and other state officials have urged the nrc to keep the 
670megawatt reactor shut down until an acceptable emergency 
evacuation plan is installed and tested last year the federal 
emergency management agency said the previous plan was unacceptable 
but nrc officials in their briefing to the commissioners said 
the original management and equipment problems that triggered the 
shutdown on april 12 1986 have been resolved they added that 
evacuation planning while not completed is greatly improved and 
should not halt the reopening of the plant 
agnes acknowledged he did not expect to be allowed to present 
testimony but said he never expected to be physically removed 
i certainly didnt expect to get dragged out of the hall he 
said i assumed the chairman would have turned and said mr 
agnes youre out of order or we wont hear you 
to impose a regime like they have here today where people 
arent even permitted to stand and request permission to speak i 
think is a very frightening spectacle he added 
earlier stephen comley a gadfly antinuclear activist was 
removed by security guards when he held up a chernobyl poster

morocco and the independence movement in 
the western sahara are sharply split on whether they can put away 
their guns and negotiate facetoface despite agreeing in 
principle to peace 
morocco and the polisario independence movement remain far apart 
on most issues said bachir m sayed an official of the 
marxistled movement says 
sayed said friday that both sides so far have only agreed on the 
wording of a referendum on the future of the arid northwest african 
territory and on how voter eligibility will be decided 
sayed said issues dividing the two sides include the 185000 
moroccan soldiers in the phosphaterich territory the moroccan 
administration the tens of thousands of moroccan settlers living 
in western sahara existing moroccan law in the area and direct 
negotiations still opposed by morocco 
morocco still refuses to shake our hand for peace sayed 
said it is proof of their lack of political will 
a moroccan official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
they want to renegotiate everything but we say we did come up 
with a peace plan that was agreed to by both parties 
we are not going to preempt the population by giving anybody 
legitimacy the official added the people of western sahara 
will decide who shall lead them and whether these people 
polisario will lead them 
sayed said un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will 
appoint a uruguayan diplomat hector s piaolillo to be his 
special representative for the region 
piaolillo is a law professor who has served as a special 
observer on human rights in central america the uruguayan mission 
in new york said 
the united nations also plans to send about 2000 peacekeeping 
troops to the western sahara to monitor the referendum 
on sept 20 perez de cuellar informed the security council that 
morocco and polisario while making comments and observations 
agreed to the proposals for a peaceful settlement put forward 
by the current chairman of the organization of african unity and 
myself 
those proposals he said included the framework for a 
ceasefire in the nearly 13yearold guerrilla war and a referendum 
to decide whether the territory will become an independent nation 
or become affiliated with morocco 
when the spanish colonial administration withdrew from their 
former possession in 1975 moroccan troops occupied the western 
sahara and the polisario movement began the fight for independence 
at least 10000 people have died in the war which has cost 
morocco up to 2 million a day to fight 
the desert territory covers about 110000 square miles and its 
population at the last spanish census in 1974 was 76000 people 
among the lingering areas of disagreement sayed said are the 
presence of moroccan troops in the territory morocco wants all 
185000 soldiers it has in the area to remain sayed said 
sayed said 7000 moroccan troops should be allowed to remain in 
the western sahara during the referendum and should be confined to 
barracks like the approximately 7000 polisario fighters who will 
confined to camps under un supervision 
the other moroccan soldiers should withdraw to their homeland 
he contended

a youth organization has demanded 
free elections and there were indications today at least two 
members of the ruling politburo will resign at a crucial communist 
party meeting 
the partys 164member central committee is to meet monday 
hoping to resolve the ethnic economic and political unrest that 
have placed yugoslavia in its worst social crisis since world war 
ii 
while the central committee makes overall policy decisions the 
23member politburo carries out the daytoday control of the party 
and government 
demands expressed friday at political meetings in four of 
yugoslavias six republics and the kosovo province ranged from 
calls by the official youth organization in slovenia to end 
oneparty rule to serbian appeals for the resignation of communist 
party chief stipe suvar 
in kosovo one ethnic albanian leader announced he was willing 
to resign from the politburo at the national central committee 
meeting according to news reports from the autonomous province 
milanko renovica a former national party chief announced 
friday he will resign from the politburo 
the kosovo party leadership is trying to deal with disputes 
between the slav minority and the majority of ethnic albanians 
kosovo is an autonomous province in serbia and serbians are 
insisting on more control claiming harassment by the predominantly 
moslem albanians most of the slavs are christians 
tanjug the state news agency reported three members of the 
national central committee from kosovo including former president 
sinan hasani are willing to resign from the committee 
the ethnic unrest that began in kosovo has spread to broader 
protests over the nations battered economy 
in slovenia the official communist youth organization issued a 
statement demanding direct elections independent trade unions the 
abolition of news censorship and termination of the oneparty 
system 
it compared rallies and tactics of the serbian communist party 
to centralize control with those of the nazis in germany before 
world war ii 
in serbia they are manipulating with the masses in the same 
way as was done in germany between the two world wars it said 
several serbian communist groups including the influential 
belgrade organization demanded suvars resignation after he 
criticized the serbian leaders earlier in the week 
belgrade party chief rados smijlkovic claimed suvar wants to 
turn mondays meeting into an indictment of serbia yugoslavias 
largest republic 
mass rallies in recent weeks have pushed serbias demand for 
more control over the nations two autonomous provinces kosovo 
and vojvodina 
the rallies alarmed nonserbian leaders who organized 
antigovernment protests and last weekend authorities used force to 
break up demonstrations in the southern republic of montenegro 
there also have been more worker protests since may when the 
government ordered an austerity program that increased prices while 
reducing wages 
belgrade newspapers reported friday that the government will 
ease the austerity program increasing wages for workers in 
profitable companies and in such social services as health and 
education 
but a new price increase took effect saturday with the 
government announcing the price of cooking oil would almost double 
to the equivalent of 125 per quart 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure serbia 
is the largest republic and both provinces kosovo and vojvodina 
are part of it but not fully subject to its control 
the decentralized system of government and collective federal 
presidency were devised in former president josip broz titos 1974 
constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the 
others but has resulted in an ineffective government by compromise

michael dukakis is counting on making himself 
more familiar and likable through a trio of tv ads that feature the 
massachusetts governor speaking directly to viewers about their 
families and the nation 
the starkly simple ads show dukakis in his shirt sleeves on a 
couch and in a suit standing behind a chair he speaks of family 
concerns in two spots of the countrys slipping international 
economic status in the third 
theyre one more attempt to give the american people a chance 
to know who mike dukakis is said dukakis spokeswoman lorraine 
voles obviously we feel if they know who he is theyre going to 
like him 
voles said the ads which began friday were the only ones 
scheduled to run nationally through the weekend 
though the consensus is that republican george bush won the 
thursday night debate between the two presidential rivals voles 
said the event gave dukakis a chance to talk positively about his 
message in front of the american people 
the ads are a good followup to the debate she said they 
lay out more of who mike dukakis really is and where he wants to 
take this country 
the bush campaign also unveiled a new national television spot 
at the end of the week keyed to the nuclear arms reduction treaty 
president reagan signed with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the ad shows pictures of americans riding a tractor reading on 
a porch and eating dinner as a narrator discusses the day the 
soviets began destroying missiles under the new treaty 
and though most americans were unaware of the significance of 
the moment or realized it was george bush who led the way someday 
their grandchildren will the narrator concludes over a shot of 
bush with one of his grandchildren in a swing 
the new dukakis ads mark a departure from the campaigns other 
efforts which have included direct hits at bush and a string of 
controversial highly polished ads seeking to depict bush as a 
packaged candidate with no substance 
in one spot dukakis discusses the daily challenge of 
finding day care the threat of drugs and the need for twoearner 
households to stay even 
the republicans say that the futures never been brighter 
dukakis says but if i were a young father today id want to 
know that my government wasnt blind to the changes in my life 
thats not a democratic concern its not a republican concern 
thats a fathers concern 
in a second ad dukakis says the nation isnt leading the world 
anymore in education or international trade and instead of 
people owing us we owe them 
how did we let this happen he asks well i think instead 
of looking for new answers we went with the old ones instead of 
doing the right thing we began doing the easy thing and now were 
in danger of falling behind im not going to let that happen 
i believe the best america is yet to come 
the third ad is a 30second version of the family spot 
with the introduction of its backtobasics approach the 
campaign pulled off the air after only one day the latest in its 
packaging of george bush series the ads six in all feature a 
group of actors playing cynical bush handlers who mock different 
aspects of bushs record as they try to figure out ways to make him 
palatable to voters 
voles said the removal of the latest packaging ad was not a 
response to complaints about the series which many commentators 
have branded elitist and obscure you may very well be seeing 
that ad along with the other packaging ads again she said 
in addition an official said another new ad will begin airing 
in texas with lloyd bentsen delivering a testimonial to dukakis 
and asking supporters in his home state to rally behind the 
democratic ticket 
dukakis also plans to make extensive use of offers to appear on 
television news programs including abcs nightline campaign 
aides said

george bush and michael dukakis campaigned on the west coast 
sounding environmental themes as a pair of postdebate surveys 
showed the vice president widening his lead over the massachusetts 
governor 
the democratic and republican presidential candidates both 
lingered in california on friday after their debate the night 
before 
dukakis took a side trip to seattle before returning for a 
breakfast this morning in los angeles for campaign volunteers 
bush had a series of tours and rallies around the golden state 
where 47 electoral votes are up for grabs 
both candidates paid close attention to environmental issues 
which are close to the fore among voters along the west coast 
bush speaking at the scripps institute of oceanography in san 
diego said for the first time that we should take a very close 
look at environmental concerns before going ahead with ocean 
drilling in the santa monica bay and adjacent areas off the 
southern california coast 
previously bush supported a delay in any oil and gas drilling 
in a scenic tract in northern california pending study of 
environmental factors 
environmentalists oppose drilling in either site 
bush also said that one of his first priorities if elected would 
be winning passage of stronger cleanair laws 
he also promised to convene a global conference on the 
environment maintaining that most of the major environmental 
problems including acid rain warming of the earth and 
deterioration of the oceans are truly international in nature 
dukakis had one of his largest crowds ever when thousands of 
people waited more than an hour in a seattle rain to hear his call 
for clean air clean water a clean coastline and clean 
government 
buoyed by the crowd after what most regarded as a losing debate 
to bush dukakis went back on the attack 
think of where well be four years from now if we elect a man 
who thinks ed meese was a great attorney general who thinks that 
james watt did an excellent job as secretary of the interior who 
thinks as he said last night that robert bork would have made an 
outstanding member of the supreme court and that dan quayle is the 
man best qualified in his party to be one heartbeat away from the 
leadership of the free world dukakis said 
bush judged the debate winner in flash polls taken immediately 
after the thursday night encounter apparently is translating that 
verdict into potential votes as well 
a poll of 529 debate viewers by the los angeles times found bush 
now favored over dukakis 52 percent to 42 percent a cbs survey of 
442 viewers showed bush was preferred by a margin of 5443 
both national surveys had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
percentage points 
bush said he wouldnt be lulled into complacency because of the 
polling data favoring him 
youre talking to a guy who when the polls were going the 
other way i said it wasnt over bush said aboard air force 2 
it wasnt so why should i now suddenly have the luxury of 
changing my position 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen also 
campaigning in california followed the dukakis lead in going after 
bush debating george bush is just like trying to eat jello with 
a fork the texas senator told a crowd in sacramento 
in fort smith ark republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle predicted he would become less of an issue as the campaign 
enters its final weeks because the american people are trying to 
make up their minds about the top of the ticket

the promise of nigerias military leaders to 
restore civilian rule in 1990 is unconditional and not linked to 
economic progress says one of the african countrys top government 
officials 
the transition to democracy is not conditioned on nigerias 
being able to achieve economic growth in 1990 there will 
definitely be assembly elections chief samuel oluyemi falae told 
reporters friday 
falae a veteran fiscal and planning official who has served 
since 1986 as secretary to the military government that came to 
power three years ago in a coup led by maj gen ibrahim babangida 
met with us government and congressional leaders and officials of 
the world bank and international monetary fund here during the past 
week 
during his visit he also flew to houston texas where a number 
of expatriate nigerians and nigerianamericans live and planned 
other talks next week in new york before returning home 
falae said the message he brought from nigeria is that africas 
most populous country is on the way to recovery from near economic 
collapse in the mid1980s and that it welcomes foreign investment 
i am not saying nigeria has become a paradise on earth for 
business but that individual businessmen now have a better 
chance to operate he said 
the pre1985 nigerian government discouraged investment by 
imposing long delays and requiring multiple approvals falae said 
a single agency of government now deals with foreign investment 
proposals and is required to reply in a maximum of 30 days he 
said adding that declaration and repatriation of dividends have 
been simplified 
nigeria has undertaken currency devaluation liberalization of 
licensing requirements consumer austerity and other reforms 
prescribed by the world bank and imf in some cases tougher than 
those demanded leaving us with flexibility he said 
fourteen months after the 1985 coup the world bank also 
signaled revived confidence in nigeria with a loan of 452 million 
the largest ever for an african country the bank praised the 
babangida government for courageous and very difficult 
austerity measures that it said justified support from the 
financial community 
after five years of decline in output the economy is showing 
signs of growth falae said we have been sailing through a 
narrow gorge and beyond us is a wide open bay 
nigeria with a population of more than 100 million has sharply 
reduced its dependence on crude oil exports with increased sales of 
nonoil manufactured products and also hopes to begin exporting 
natural gas falae said

genocide would become a crime under us law 
as a result of legislation freshly approved by the senate and sent 
to president reagan for his signature 
the bill provides for us participation in an international 
treaty outlawing genocide a pact that emerged from the ashes of 
the holocaust but went unratified by the united states until 1986 
the united states would fulfill its treaty obligation under the 
bill sent to reagan on friday by making genocide a crime under 
domestic law 
the action marked a triumph for retiring sen william proxmire 
dwis who has given more than 3000 speeches over the past 19 
years in favor of the treaty 
like the treaty itself the implementing legislation was dogged 
by delays some conservatives feared that the language of the pact 
contained uncertaintities that could undermine the constitution 
but the house passed the bill on april 25 making genocide a 
crime punishable by life in prison 
in the senate sen strom thurmond rsc a longtime critic of 
the treaty offered his support but only if the maximum penalty 
were increased to death proxmire balked at that saying many of 
the pacts strongest partisans also were opposed to the death 
penalty 
democratic senators said thurmond dropped plans to offer a 
capital punishment amendment in exchange for a senate vote on a 
number of president reagans judicial nominees democrats had hoped 
to keep the judgeships open giving democrat michael dukakis a 
chance to fill the vacancies if he won the presidential election in 
november 
eleven judges were confirmed immediately after the senate acted 
on the genocide bill 
addressing the senate proxmire said the treaty was made 
necessary by the deliberate murder of 6 million jews 
they were gassed lined up and shot and they were worked to 
death proxmire said 
why only because they worshiped god in a different way 
proxmire won praise for his marathon persistence in urging 
ratification and implementation of the treaty 
i have no single doubt in my mind that there would be no 
treaty without sen proxmire said sen joseph r biden jr 
ddel 
biden called the wisconsin senator a man of phenomenal 
tenacity and said you have never let go of a single issue in 
which you believed 
sen arlen specter rpa noted that the senates final action 
to put the treaty into effect comes at the conclusion of proxmires 
more than 30year senate career 
there could be no greater tribute to sen proxmire specter 
said 
as ratified two years ago the treaty declares genocide an 
international crime and defines it as the intentional destruction 
of national ethnic racial or religious groups in whole or in 
part

us ambassador john mccarthy has been 
meeting regularly with members of the rival moslem and christian 
governments but he denied charges that he is interfering in the 
internal affairs of the country 
since his sept 24 appointment mccarthy has been meeting almost 
daily with leaders of the feuding factions to settle a crisis that 
has left the country without a president 
parliament failed to agree on a successor to president amin 
gemayels before his sixyear term expired sept 22 since then 
rival christian and moslem cabinets claim they govern lebanon 
some christian leaders have accused mccarthy of interfering 
my government is trying to make a positive contribution in 
what must be the most complex and confused period of time in the 
history of lebanon mccarthy responded friday 
i regret very much if i have offended any one that was never 
my intention he said 
foreign ministry undersecretary farouk abillamaa a maronite 
catholic was quoted by several beirut newspapers friday as saying 
he considered mccarthy as only an american envoy and not an 
accredited ambassador 
the independent daily annahar the conservative alanwar and 
the leftist assafir all said that abillamaa a christian 
apparently was angered at mccarthys refusal to present his 
credentials to the christian government 
the foreign ministry is located in christian east beirut and is 
controlled by the christian caretaker cabinet of army commander 
gen michel aoun 
the aoun government is locked in a struggle for legitimacy with 
the predominantly moslem cabinet based in west beirut which is 
headed by syrianbacked acting prime minister salim hoss 
aouns appointment sept 22 in the last minutes of gemayels 
term caused a political crisis threatening to formalize the 
unofficial christianmoslem partition created by the outbreak of 
civil war in 1975 
mccarthy who succeeded john kelly has been pressing for a 
speedy election of a new president to defuse the new crisis 
mccarthy has said he will present his credentials only to the 
new president indicating washingtons neutrality 
danny chamoun head of the national liberal party also 
criticized mccarthy after meeting with abillamaa friday 
he complained that maccarthy had no right to visit the governor 
of the central bank edmond naim at the bank in moslem west beirut 
on thursday 
that meeting prompted local speculation that the united states 
might be urging naim a maronite catholic to run for president 
naim has pledged to keep the central bank neutral in the current 
conflict between the two rival governments 
chamoun a presidential aspirant and political opponent of naim 
called the visit overt intervention in lebanons domestic 
affairs

the government has authorized loading of fuel 
and eventual startup of the nations first nuclear power plant 
but environmental groups threaten to fight it with civil 
disobedience 
the approval came after government specialists testified for a 
week before both houses of congress and opponents pledged to block 
roads and hold a mass sitin 
assistant energy secretary jose luis alcudia announced the 
governments decision friday to allow the laguna verda plant to 
move forward

after six months of loading fuel and operating tests officials 
said the second reactor is to be ready by 1991 
a joint communique of the energy and ecology departments friday 
night said the government is assuming this responsibility with 
the absolute conviction that laguna verde is convenient for the 
country and will not pose problems for the health and wellbeing of 
the population 
the statement said the government had devised adequate security 
and evacuation plans for the plant in case of accident it said 
these had been sanctioned by the us institute of nuclear power 
operations and the international atomic energy organization 
it said the electricity generated by laguna verde each year 
would save 14 million barrels of combustible fuels 
the plant 200 miles east of mexico city in veracruz state was 
ready for the loading of radioactive fuel in december but 
president miguel de la madrid postponed plans after protests by 
environmental groups 
mexicos leading ecology and antinuclear organizations vowed to 
mount a protest rally on sunday in palma sola three miles from the 
plant 
jose arias chavez leader of the pact of ecological groups said 
demonstrators would block roads and possibly attempt to occupy the 
grounds of the nuclear plant similar demonstrations were planned 
throughout the country he said 
he said protesters wanted to avoid the nuclearization of 
mexico

islamic fundamentalists reacting to a 
week of widespread riots have called for an end to emergency 
regulations a national minimum wage civic freedoms and more 
vigorous promotion of islam 
their 12point program called for an end to a state of 
emergency the government imposed a sixday state of emergency 
during the rioting but the fundamentalists said such rules had 
actually been in force since 1962 when algeria became independent 
from france 
the time has come to let the people speak said ali belhadj 
an imam at the al sunna mosque in the babeloued quarter a 
fundamentalist stronghold the religious leader read the program 
before worshipers at friday prayers 
riots broke out oct 4 in algiers and provincial cities over 
shortages high food prices and the governments program of 
austerity and economic reform several days of fragile calm have 
followed a week of unrest 
belhadj was among fundamentalist leaders who organized rallies 
trying to focus discontent on religious as well as economic issues 
the fundamentalists program stopped short of demanding an 
islamic state in algeria which already declares islam the official 
religion but operates in secular style with emphasis on strict 
socialist policies 
it called for an end to nepotism and feudalism in the 
administration amnesty for all political prisoners an unspecified 
guaranteed minimum wage the unrestricted freedom to spread islam 
and fundamental freedoms to allow people to manage their own 
affairs 
the program also called for freedom of association and 
expression freedom to criticize the state judicial reform 
amendment of legislation to eliminate any notion contrary to 
islam reform of education to promote islam and freedom of the 
press 
the government has said 180 people died in the rioting but 
algerian officials said on condition of anonymity that many more 
were killed 
unofficial reports said 500 or more died more than 1000 people 
were injured according to reliable accounts from hospitals and 
other sources 
the official algerian news agency on friday accused french news 
media of trying to provoke conflicts among algerians but it did 
not cite examples the algerie presse service said the french press 
was plotting against the sacred principle of algerias unity 
most french newspapers have carried commentaries suggesting that 
their government and french intellectuals have been too slow to 
condemn the killings of unarmed protesters by algerian troops 
an associated press photographer roberto pfeil was detained 
friday while taking pictures of moslem worshipers and expelled from 
algeria the government gave no explanation 
on wednesday president chadli bendjedid announced a process 
of democratization beginning with a national referendum nov 3 
on making the prime minister responsible to the national assembly 
details of bendjedids broad proposals have not become clear 
but they appear to point toward loosening the state structure built 
by his predecessor houari boumedienne 
boumedienne who kept tight control for 13 years died 10 years 
ago and bendjedid was elected to replace him almost immediately 
he sought to weaken the system in which the ruling national 
liberation front party kept tight rein on the nation

a statesponsored deer hunt for 
children as young as 8 has drawn fire from animal welfare groups 
and educators who claim its too traumatic to allow kids to kill 
the likes of bambi 
for the past four years the state game and fresh water fish 
commission has held the hunt without controversy for about 160 
children ages 8 to 15 who are accompanied by adults game 
officials and gun advocates say the event teaches youngsters to 
hunt and use firearms safely 
but this year opponents ranging from the animalrights group 
fund for animals to the dade county school board and pta are 
protesting the hunt scheduled for this weekend in camp blanding a 
rural area south of jacksonville 
having children kill animals for fun is ridiculous said 
sharon bailey of north miami who heads the florida chapter of the 
friends of animals a national antihunting group 
it twists the values of our children ive taken 8yearolds 
to see bambi even that upsets them she said of the animated 
disney movie in which the young deers mother is shot by a hunter 
strong protests also have come from officials in dade county 
which includes miami where shooting incidents have left 37 youths 
18 years old or younger dead so far this year 13 more than in all 
of 1987 
im outraged that we could be encouraging our students to use 
guns we need to come to our senses about the use of guns said 
county school superintendent joseph fernandez 
at a breakfast earlier this week in palm beach author and 
activist cleveland amory confronted gov bob martinez and demanded 
he cancel the hunt 
have you no shame said amory who founded the fund for 
animals have you no pity it is high time for a brave governor 
to know what he is doing with this 
but the governor ignored amorys comments and later said the 
hunt should go ahead because it fosters closer relationships 
between parents and their children 
this is a highly controlled deer and hog hunt said game 
commission spokesman jim huffstodt there has never been an 
accident its extremely popular it is done to introduce youth to 
hunting and wildlife 
in each hunt there is a 40deer limit 
george rauback a hunter from west dade and a national rifle 
association member said the youth hunt teaches children to respect 
guns 
i learned to hunt with my father and older brother rauback 
said this is a reasonable idea it teaches hunting etiquette 
the safe handling of firearms is always worthwhile 
in addition to this weekends hunt another youth hunt is 
scheduled at camp blanding on oct 2930 and three other hunts are 
planned elsewhere in the state including one for handicapped 
youngsters set for nov 46 
state rep john cosgrove a democrat said its wrong for the 
state to sponsor the hunts 
i hunted as a teenager and understand the feeling that people 
have for the outdoors however i feel that encouraging children 
under 18 to bear arms in pursuit of animal kills is not a proper 
function of the state he said

the united states has given a check for 
856 million to the united nations but washington owes millions 
more that the reagan administration withheld pending un austerity 
measures 
us ambassador vernon a walters delivered the money during a 
surprise visit friday to secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
the check reduced the us debt to the regular budget to 3663 
million 
a un statement said the payment was the second installment of 
the 188 million president reagan promised to pay by the end of the 
year the united states earlier paid 152 million 
the payment was made one day after the soviet union which is 
paying its own arrears pledged the equivalent of 600 million to 
un relief and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan 
the united nations remains financially weakened and unstable 
because reserves are substantially depleted said a un 
statement 
if this situation is not corrected it could impede the 
carrying out of new peace missions it said referring to un 
peacekeeping forces currently in the persian gulf and new forces 
planned for southern africa and eventually for cambodia 
since reagan took office eight years ago his administration has 
harshly criticized the united nations for what it calls 
antiwestern bias bureaucracy and waste 
the administration withheld part of us regular budget dues to 
the un some peacekeeping dues and other fees in order to 
pressure the world body into fiscal and administrative reforms 
reagan recently acknowledged that the un had made progress in 
reforms and pledged to pay back the withheld dues by the end of 
this year and the rest over several years 
but us officials said washington will continue to withhold 59 
million in dues promised this year until a key un committee 
approves a new austerity budget and other administrative changes 
the new york times reported in todays editions 
the fifth committee of the general assembly which oversees the 
uns finances is still considering a new austerity budget 
adopted by a smaller committee last month it said

one of two tuscarora indians acquitted of 
charges stemming from their armed takeover of a newspaper called 
the verdict historic but the prosecutor said he feels sorry 
for the hostages they took 
eddie hatcher 31 and timothy jacobs 20 were found innocent 
friday of all charges related to the february takeover in which 
they held hostages for 10 hours at the office of the robesonian 
the jury agreed with defense lawyers contention that the two 
men had no criminal intent when they took over the building to draw 
attention to alleged official corruption racism and drug 
trafficking in robeson county in southeastern north carolina the 
county is onethird indian onethird black and onethird white 
hatcher and jacobs faced charges of making and possessing 
illegal firearms conspiring to make those weapons and conveying 
false information about explosives a federal charge of 
hostagetaking was dismissed earlier this week against jacobs but 
remained against hatcher 
the jury has made what is going to be a historic verdict a 
verdict that people will remember hatcher said while leaving the 
courthouse after the threeweek trial i dont think people 
realize yet how important this verdict is 
one white juror patience brannock hugged hatcher in the 
hallway saying god bless you youre a good boy 
however one of the hostages robesonian editor bob horne said 
the verdict sent the wrong message 
it seems to me the message is if you have a grievance to 
take hostages put them in fear for their lives and say you did it 
for your own protection because you feared for your life horne 
said 
does that say that timothy jacobs and eddie hatchers fear 
counts more than the fear of the people they held hostage that 
day he asked i saw terror that morning like i have never seen 
before and hope i never see again 
assistant us attorney john bruce who prosecuted the case 
said the verdict was a failure of advocacy on my part and added 
that he felt particularly sorry for those taken hostage 
anyone who was here in the first part of the trial to hear 
their testimony knows they were in real terror i feel that i have 
let them down he said 
hatcher and jacobs never denied walking into the robesonian 
office feb 1 chaining the door shut and brandishing sawedoff 
shotguns they held as many as 20 people during the siege in which 
no one was injured 
they surrendered after they were told the governor had agreed to 
set up a task force to investigate their allegations 
during closing arguments thursday defense lawyers said hatcher 
and jacobs had not staged the takeover with malice 
that argument was the deciding factor in the whole case one 
unidentified juror told the news and observer of raleigh i feel 
it was fair based on the interpretation of the law 
there were no jury room arguments or heated discussions during 
deliberations said juror sarah thompson of raleigh 
we focused on the nomalice argument right there because we 
had told ourselves not to let our feelings into it ms thompson 
said 
the panel of nine blacks and three whites took 6 hours to 
return the verdicts 
if convicted hatcher could have faced life in prison and jacobs 
could have faced 40 years in prison 
im just glad that timothy and eddie did something to draw 
attention to the conditions in our county said eleanor jacobs 
jacobs mother i hate they used guns but they did bring 
attention to something that was needed the jury had compassion 
they understood things 
robeson district attorney joe freeman britt one of the 
officials hatcher and jacobs criticized for allegedly failing to 
represent poor people in the county said friday he has begun 
exploratory work to determine whether to pursue state charges 
jacobs said he was uneasy about returning to robeson county 
im afraid jacobs said but its my home and where my 
family is so i am going 
im not afraid said hatcher who represented himself during 
the trial because his lawyer william kunstler was involved in a 
new york trial im going home

fifty years after the first jews fled nazi 
europe for shanghai the refugees from around the world gathered to 
recall nights in crowded warehouses and life in the steamy port 
that was their haven 
its been an electrifying experience ive met so many people 
i havent seen in all these years said norman shelton 61 who 
left berlin for shanghai in april 1939 and now lives in orlando 
fla 
shelton was among about 18000 jewish refugees who fled germany 
austria and poland for shanghai in 1938 and 1939 the chinese port 
was then the only place in the world where escaping jews could 
settle without visas 
most remained there until 1948 
about 150 of the group who call themselves the 
shanghailanders gathered this week for a fourday reunion 
that ended friday it was held in israel to coincide with the 
countrys 40th anniversary celebrations 
reunions also were held in 1980 in los angeles and in 1985 in 
new york but many of those who came to israel missed the earlier 
gatherings they sang japanese nursery rhymes traded yellowed 
photographs of soccer games played in the teeming shanghai streets 
and renewed friendships 
you cant believe the excitement i met someone here that i 
slept alongside for four years in the same dormitory and havent 
seen since said frankfurtborn manfred konig of new york 
some of their more famous comrades including artist peter max 
and extreasury secretary michael blumenthal were absent 
the journey to china from europe was a perilous odyssey that 
took a month often through siberia by rail and then by freighter 
ship to shanghai 
the refugees left with just 10 marks about 4 in their pockets 
and carried naziissued passports stamped with a large red j 
for jew and the words for exit only 
the twoyear exodus to shanghai began after the crystal 
night nov 9 1938 when naziled rioters attacked jewish homes 
and businesses in germany and austria and set dozens of synagogues 
ablaze 
the attack marked the start of adolf hitlers slaughter of 6 
million jews 
sheltons father was among the 30000 jews arrested and sent to 
concentration camps at dachau and buchenwald on crystal night 
we soon discovered the only way to get my dad out was to go to 
the nazis with a oneway ticket out of germany shelton said 
my mother was frantic she ran into the street and people told 
her about shanghai we got the money together and we were gone in 
three weeks 
shelton described his fathers shock as the family prepared to 
flee the first thing my dad did after getting out of that 
concentration camp was to pull out his world war i decorations and 
throw them into the toilet bowl 
curt pollack whose family fled berlin in january 1939 recalled 
the rampant disease and malnutrition that awaited the refugees in 
subtropical shanghai and left about 2000 dead 
these men were released from concentration camps straight onto 
the boat after 28 arduous days they arrived in the stifling heat 
of shanghai my father had dysentery within a week people were 
dying right and left he said 
germanborn claude spingarn was nine years old when his family 
arrived at shanghai in march 1939 
we were piled into this pickup truck and taken to a warehouse 
where about 100 people were sleeping in bedrolls on the floor 
rations were served from a soup kitchen my mother was in shock 
said spingarn of rochester ny 
when the pacific war broke out in 1942 the shanghai jews were 
confined by the occupying japanese to a 3squaremile ghetto in a 
warehouse district jobs were scarce and hunger widespread but 
pollack said the hardships forged a special closeness 
we formed a permanent bond i was born in germany and i live 
in los angeles but my most vivid memories are of shanghai he 
said 
pollack like many other shanghai jews has since returned to 
the teeming chinese port in 1980 and 1984 
i had the desire to go back and see the old neighborhood 
again he said some people go back to brooklyn to see if the 
old deli is still there for me shanghai is the closest thing i 
can come to reminiscing and going back

hundreds of northwest airlines passengers 
have been stricken with an illness that may be linked to 
contaminated food served on several flights a malady so 
distressing that some victims said they thought they were going 
to die 
we have cases all over the country said michael osterholm 
the state epidemiologist the minnesota health department received 
hundreds of calls thursday and friday he said 
five of the reports which came to light after members of the 
minnesota vikings football team were sickened were confirmed as 
cases of the bacterial illness shigellosis an intestinal infection 
that causes severe diarrhea gripping abdominal pain and other 
symptoms that can last for five to seven days 
the one common phrase being reported to investigators is 
people thinking they have never been so sick that they thought 
they were going to die osterholm said 
he said he expects additional cases to be confirmed in the next 
few weeks 
it would not surprise me if there eventually were hundreds of 
confirmed cases but right now any number estimate would be 
premature he said 
those who were confirmed with the illness took northwest flights 
that originated in minneapolisst paul and went to nashville 
tenn detroit seattle and newark nj osterholm said the 
malady was reported among members of the minnesota vikings after 
they took a charter flight to miami 
the flights occurred between sept 25 and oct 4 osterholm said 
illnesses that could be shigellosis were reported by people who 
were on about 30 flights the latest of which was oct 8 
we have no reason to believe it is happening now he said 
the confirmed illnesses have been traced to food prepared in 
marriott corps airline kitchen at the minneapolisst paul 
international airport the facility prepares 100000 meals a week 
for northwest 
the outbreak came to light after 21 players and staff of the 
vikings became acutely ill two to five days after their game in 
miami oct 2 osterholm said thursday that after the game the 
vikings some of their family members and two miami locker room 
workers ate marriott sandwiches that were brought from minneapolis 
in addition to contracting the disease from contaminated food 
the illness spreads easily from person to person 
two members of the vikings brad edwards and tim irwin were 
hospitalized after eating the sandwiches the st paul pioneer 
press dispatch reported irwin a 280pound tackle lost 9 pounds 
there were no other reports of hospitalizations in the united 
states 
alan munchaster vice president of corporate relations for 
northwest said preliminary tests on marriott employees who may 
have handled the food were negative marriott is conducting further 
tests to pinpoint the source of the bacteria munchaster said 
theyre looking at cold food and the lettuce munchaster 
said those seem to be the culprits 
munchaster said marriott is testing its outgoing food as an 
additional precaution

michael dukakis early today attended a 
birthday tribute to jesse jackson saluting his former rivals work 
on behalf of the democratic party while joking about a flap that 
jeopardized their relationship 
the democratic presidential nominee also trumpeted his candidacy 
at the los angeles gathering and was given a glowing endorsement by 
jackson 
dukakis was picking up the endorsement of a hispanic police 
group today in los angeles before flying on to san antonio texas 
and then home to boston 
the jackson event came at the end of a marathon campaign day for 
dukakis who appeared with jackson on friday morning in los 
angeles hours later with running mate lloyd bentsen in sacramento 
at an early evening rally in seattle and a meeting of a hispanic 
organization back in los angeles just before attending the jackson 
party 
at each of the stops he raised an issue that came up during his 
final debate with republican nominee george bush on thursday the 
appointments the next president will get to make to the supreme 
court 
dukakis told the crowds that bush would appoint people like 
robert bork an appointee of president reagan who was rejected by 
the senate while he would appoint justices dedicated to civil and 
voters rights 
joint appearances between dukakis and jackson have been rare 
since the democratic national convention and dukakis attempting a 
series of jokes during his address at the birthday party created 
an awkward moment when he joked that he had not known about the 
party until told by reporters 
dont you think hed have called me dukakis said his joke 
met by polite but nervous laughter 
when dukakis selected bentsen he was unable to reach jackson 
and the former candidate was told of the selection by reporters 
sparking a temporary rift between the two 
dukakis also turned questions about his personality into jokes 
about the exuberant jackson 
jesse youve got to smile more dukakis said weve got 
to make him a little more likeable dont you think 
dukakis came bearing gifts giving jackson a video cassette 
recorder a dukakisbentsen hat and a dukakis campaign jacket 
in return jackson delivered an impassioned endorsement of his 
former rival 
the governor set the pace established the principles 
articulated the policies set forth the priorities jackson said 
now we the people must make the investment 
jackson said that a bush administration would threaten civil 
rights gains and declared 
governor dukakis can be trusted to keep hope alive and build 
the america that must be the america of our dreams 
earlier at the hispanic event dukakis continued his 
postdebate attempt to paint bush as a failed leader who 
demonstrated his lack of judgment in selecting indiana sen dan 
quayle as his running mate and by saying during the debate that 
bork would have been an outstanding justice 
he mockingly referred to bushs pledge to put quayle in charge 
of the war on drugs 
ladies and gentlemen we cant take four years of that we 
cant take four days of that dukakis said 
he also defended himself against bush charges that dukakis is 
soft on crime referring to crimes committed against his father and 
brother and the decline in major crimes during his tenure as 
massachusetts governor 
i just didnt decide to care in an election year dukakis 
said

a district of columbia man whose vocal chords 
were crushed by a police chokehold after he got into a dispute 
with officers at the scene of a traffic accident has been awarded 
12 million 
a superior court jury on friday granted the award to townsend w 
janey 
janey 51 had come to the scene of a may 1985 accident 
involving his son derek and berated police for taking too long to 
arrive when an officer put him in a chokehold 
i was moving my hand back and forth trying to get some air in 
there and i felt i was passing out but i dont ever remember 
hitting the ground he recalled on friday 
janey was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct but the 
case was thrown out by a dc judge a month later and three 
investigations by the city found that the arrest was groundless and 
excessive force had been used 
two officers were disciplined in connection with the incident 
but city officials said the award was excessive and would be 
appealed

landmark from oblivion she bought the fiberglass statue from the 
eatery for 1500 in 1985 and would not let rejection ruffle her 
feathers 
she decided to turn chicken boy into a golden goose 
last year she created the chicken boy catalog for a perfect 
world filled with a line of gifts inspired by the statue which 
has the head of a cartoon hen and the body of a muscle man holding 
a yellow bucket of chicken 
chicken boy always really meant something to me said ms 
inouye he kind of symbolizes los angeles i think hes odd and 
goofy and also kind of serene which is something i admire 
the catalog offers tshirts postcards mugs watches ball 
point pens even boxer shorts all bearing chicken boys 
likeness many items include his motto too tall to live too 
weird to die 
the catalog also features such novelties as goodyear tire 
ashtrays lava lites and ms inouyes own creation computer 
cozies computer covers that come in hawaiian or leopard prints 
chicken boy so far hasnt generated the kind of consumer 
interest of garfield or the smurfs but ms inouye says she has 
sold about 2000 tshirts and has managed to turn a small profit 
there really hasnt been a plan behind all this i look at it 
more as a learning experience she said

a man who claims to be the sailor 
kissing a nurse in a famous life magazine photograph taken at the 
end of world war ii has settled a lawsuit against time inc but 
the sailors identity remains a mystery 
the photograph by alfred eisenstaedt which appeared in the aug 
27 1945 issue of life shows a sailor and a nurse kissing 
passionately in new york citys times square to celebrate japans 
surrender to the united states 
the settlement approved here friday by us district judge 
ronald r lagueux does not state if george mendonsa the 
64yearold middletown fisherman who claimed to be the sailor 
truly is 
there was no exchange of money and mendonsa agreed to 
acknowledge that time possesses a valid copyright and may use the 
photograph as it likes 
mendonsa who filed the suit in june 1987 had sought 100000 
compensation claiming the magazine was profiting by selling copies 
of the photograph for 1600 
time inc was never able to identify the sailor said laury 
frieber a new yorkbased attorney for the owner of life we did 
not as the result of the settlement make any representation as to 
who the sailor is we consider the result a victory 
patrick hayes sr mendonsas attorney said friday he and his 
client are 85 percent satisfied we never did expect any money 
damages 
hayes said his client merely wanted to submit for the record a 
report by richard ma benson a photography expert and instructor 
at yale university that mendonsa hired to examine the photograph 
the report stated mendonsa and the sailor shared several 
physical traits including an unusual bump on the inside of the 
left arm indicating with a reasonable degree of certainty that 
mendonsa was the man in the photograph 
i know it sounds kind of funny mendonsa has said of his 
claim but people like me dont often do something famous 
regardless of how insignificant it seemed at the time i owe it in 
part to the men i served with 
at least 23 men have told time they are the sailor in the 
photograph lagueux wrote in his consent judgement 
time asserted in the agreement that even if the sailor was 
mendonsa the magazine was entitled to use the picture under the 
first amendment of the constitution 
imagine the consequences if anytime a recognizable figure 
could not be sold without the involvement of the subject or its 
descendants said harry johnston vice president and general 
counsel for times magazine division

a reallife version of the 
amityville horror forced authorities to bulldoze a house in this 
chicago suburb after flames mysteriously shot from an electrical 
socket and smoky mists filled the air 
maybe its ghosts i dont know insurance adjuster joe 
skubisz said friday laughing and quickly noting he doesnt believe 
in such things 
theres no truth to the rumor there was any type of haunted 
situation there it was strictly some type of escaping gas but the 
fire department wouldnt allow the policyholder to live in the 
house so we had to pay out on the claim said skubisz associate 
manager of a travelers insurance co claim office 
while skubisz believes there is some logical explanation for the 
phenomena arson investigators steve smith and terry hyland of the 
orland fire district say engineers chemists geologists 
scientists and experts in explosives ran every conceivable test and 
couldnt come up with an answer 
they ruled out arson natural gas methane gas sewer gas other 
vapors or electricity 
we have no logical explanation now but maybe 50 years from 
now someone will come up with an answer hyland said right 
now we just dont know 
the house was subjected to every kind of test it was 
demolished because there was nothing left to test for the only 
experiment left was to let someone live in that house he said 
fire officials recorded 26 separate reports of strange 
happenings from march to august 
travelers which had insured the house finally concluded it 
wasnt safe to live in so on thursday the 9yearold home south 
of chicago was bulldozed into a pile of rubble 
one of the most frightening incidents happened in april when a 
flame one inch in diameter roared out of a wall socket in an 
upstairs bedroom and shot 21 inches into a mattress smith said 
the flame was witnessed by an orland hills police officer an 
electrician who was a parttime officer in another community and 
two consulting engineers hired to investigate the mystery smith 
said 
the fire was under pressure and that kind of pressure cant 
build up in electrical conduit because its open throughout the 
entire house he said 
at other times dense smoky mists or a strong smell of sulfur 
permeated the house the investigators said 
after the first few incidents fire authorities advised the 
family who lived there not to sleep in the home at night when the 
bizarre events continued authorities told the family to move out 
and travelers hired an engineering company to investigate

a grand jury indicted a white teenager 
on seconddegree murder charges in connection with the shooting of 
a black man whose death triggered rioting in a mostly black 
neighborhood last month 
tamala tami vergo 17 of greenwood faces a maximum penalty 
of life in prison if convicted in the killing of william mckinney 
22 she was indicted thursday 
police said the sept 20 shooting stemmed from a drug deal that 
went sour but that mckinney was only a bystander 
officials have blamed the rioting in the cedar grove 
neighborhood on a buildup of racial tension in the black community 
from several factors including unemployment 
cynthia johnson who was not indicted in the case told police 
she drove ms vergo to a convenience store parking lot to buy 
crack cocaine 
police said there was a confrontation at the site and ms vergo 
allegedly fired two indiscriminate shots toward a group of people 
nearby one bullet struck mckinney who was not involved in the 
dispute 
defense attorney maurice loridans has indicated his defense of 
ms vergo will include selfprotection

fishermen protesting chemical pollution 
agreed today to accept more than 20 million to end a sitin that 
halted work at 18 factories in a major petrochemical complex a 
government official said 
about 2000 fishermen stormed the linyuan industrial park about 
220 miles south of taipei on wednesday they claim polluted 
wastewater from the factories has poisoned fish and shrimp in their 
fishing grounds 
they originally demanded a total of 263 million or about 
3500 for each of the 7500 members of their nearby village 
sanwei 
however yang shihchien head of the industrial development 
bureau said the fishermen instead agreed to a total of 207 
million or about 2800 for each resident the government and 
factories will share the cost 
the official told reporters that operation of the complex would 
resume soon possibly by sunday or monday 
government officials will continue to negotiate with residents 
in other villages affected by the pollution he said 
meanwhile economics minister chen lian told legislators his 
ministry would tighten pollution controls at the complex within 
three years 
the affected companies include two that account for about 60 
percent of the ethylene propylene and other chemical materials 
supplied to taiwans exportoriented textile and plastic industries

in a court filing prosecutors say a 
23yearold former firefighter admitted setting about 17 of the 
more than 20 arson fires that have terrorized the town of jefferson 
and nearby areas for six months 
prosecutors made the claim in an effort to persuade coos county 
superior court judge harold perkins ii on friday to detain lance 
lalumiere in jail without bail lalumiere is being held in lieu of 
50000 cash bail 
perkins continued lalumieres bail hearing until tuesday he 
also delayed action on a similar request by prosecutors to revoke 
50000 cash bail for lawrence coulter jr 19 of jefferson 
another volunteer firefighter who also is charged in the case 
though prosecutors said lalumiere admitted setting the fires 
they said they dont want to release the statements or other 
evidence until after the evidence is presented to a grand jury 
that sparked objections by lalumieres lawyer philip waystack 
who demanded copies of the documents waystack told perkins it is 
unfair for the state to cite the evidence but refuse to disclose it 
the state cannot have it both ways he said it cant make 
use of alleged evidence to detain this man then hold that 
evidence 
we all must keep in focus that mr lalumiere has certain 
constitutional protections one of them is the presumption of 
innocence he added 
county attorney pierre morin and assistant attorney general 
andrew serell argued in their motion that lalumiere should be 
detained due to the nature and number of these offenses they 
also argued that the dishwasher poses a serious risk to the 
safety of the community 
on wednesday state police charged lalumiere of jefferson with 
setting one fire and said they plan to seek indictments charging 
him with 15 others 
the motion by morin and serell said that in addition to the aug 
23 fire lalumiere is formally charged with setting defendant has 
given statements admitting to committing some 16 other acts of 
arson in the jefferson nh area 
jefferson population 850 has had 21 suspicious fires since 
may nearby towns have had at least three others including one 
oct 3 in dalton for which coulter was charged thursday 
perkins scheduled hearings monday for each defendant on the 
defense requests for evidence 
neither man entered a plea at his arraignment which is 
customary in felony arraignments in district courts

southern california is well known for its 
fitnessoriented culture but reporters who came to cover this 
weeks presidential debate were greeted by one bit of hospitality 
that did not quite fit in with the healthconscious stereotype 
in the ucla ballroom where a press working area was set up 
media representatives were treated to all the free cigarettes they 
could smoke 
the tables piled with cigarette packs came courtesy of the 
philip morris company as did the full buffet of cold cuts hot 
dishes salads and desserts 
it wasnt the first time those covering the debates were treated 
by the cigarette manufacturer 
the traveling press hospitality center has followed the 
electionyear debate schedule from the heart of tobacco land in 
winstonsalem nc where the first michael dukakisgeorge bush 
debate was held to omaha neb for last weeks vice presidential 
debate and on to los angeles for the last presidential showdown 
and there was a specific reason for the omnipresence of philip 
morris even though some nonsmoking members of the media 
complained that the dispensing of free cigarettes only encouraged 
puffing by smokers who have learned to curtail their habit aboard 
campaign planes 
philip morris was one of the three top financial backers of the 
trio of debates said janet brown director of the bipartisan 
commission on presidential debates that hosted the events 
she did not disclose the amount of philip morris contribution 
but said it was in the sixfigure range the cost of putting on 
each debate was estimated at some 500000 which had to be raised 
by the commission from corporate private and other sources 
it was philip morris request to contribute to the debate by 
fully outfitting the press center at each one she said 
as for the cigarettes they simply said theyd like to put out 
a range of their products including cigarettes 
other philip morrisowned products on hand included jello 
pudding in addition to free pens notebooks and ashtrays 
philip morris is also a major contributor to the democratic 
party giving the democratic national committee at least 100000

colombias liberal and conservative 
parties have agreed to reform the countrys constitution and a 
court system that will not let drug traffickers go unpunished 
appears to be one of the goals 
other proposed changes would allow the bicarmel legislature to 
force cabinet ministers to resign and allow presidential primary 
elections 
the amended constitution also would end 28 years of each 
president being required to name some cabinet ministers from the 
opposition party 
the agreement disclosed friday by colombias minister of 
government cesar gaviria ended two years of bitter feuding 
between the two parties on what changes there should be in the 
constitution 
president virgilio barco of the liberal party met for eight 
hours with former president julio cesar turbay director of the 
liberal party and former president misael pastrana chief of the 
conservative party gaviria said 
the colombian congress will be asked to approve the 
constitutional reforms before it goes into recess dec 17 gaviria 
said at a news conference the liberal and conservative parties 
make up 95 percent of colombias congress 
a bipartisan congressional committee appointed earlier this year 
to study possible reforms decided that colombias court system 
should be patterned in some ways after the us court system 
the current 19thcentry court system in colombia has judges 
investigating cases taking depositions hearing out of court 
testimony and deciding on their own if a suspect should be charged 
or set free 
it is common knowledge that some judges are bribed no major 
drug trafficker has ever been convicted of drug trafficking and 
spent more than a few weeks in jail 
currently federal prosecutors play a very small role in 
colombia criminal charges are made by individuals and a chief 
judge assigns investigations to other judges under the new system 
a federal prosecutor would decide who would be charged and would 
take over the investigatory duties 
the constitutional reform committee also envisions the naming of 
a special prosecutor to be in charge of human rights cases 
death squads have killed more than 800 people in the last two 
years each of those cases is investigated by a different judge 
denying the possibility of a major federal investigation linking 
any of the cases 
there have been only 12 convictions in death squad cases 
the minister of government said friday that the constitutional 
reforms would allow colombias congress to force a cabinet minister 
to resign 
currently colombias congress has little power constitutional 
reform would allow the congress to censure a cabinet minister on a 
vote of confidence 
another major change in colombian politics would be the end of 
colombias national front a sharing of power between the liberal 
and conservative parties the national front was created 28 years 
ago to end a war between the liberal and conservative parties a 
war that took more than 250000 lives 
the two parties had decided then to alternate the presidency 
every four years with no president being able to succeed himself 
the national front agreement also requires each president to 
name some cabinet ministers from the opposition party the number 
appointed depends upon the percentage of votes the opposition 
received in the presidential election the conservative party 
withdrew from the front after barco was elected in 1986 the two 
party leaders also agreed the constitition should allow each party 
to decide before each presidential election if there should be a 
primary election gaviria said 
under the bill to be presented to congress future changes in 
the constitution could be proposed by the president and put to a 
national vote the minister of government said now only the 
congress can amend the constitution

winnie mandela visited her 
husband black nationalist nelson mandela at his tightly guarded 
hospital room today and said he was angry at suggestions he was 
cooperating with the government 
president pw botha while in switzerland last week suggested 
the jailed african national congress leader could be freed if he 
continues cooperating with the authorities as he is doing at 
present 
about the socalled cooperation with the government mandela 
says he will answer to that himself mrs mandela told reporters 
as he said that he looked very angry 
mandela 70 is recuperating from tuberculosis at the 
constantiaberg clinic a modern private hospital in cape town he 
became ill in august and doctors expect him to make a complete 
recovery in two to three months 
mrs mandela said she and her husband did not discuss the latest 
wave of speculation that he may soon be freed after 26 years in 
prison 
all the rumors about his release are sheer rumors she said 
in addition to his wife mandela was visited for more than an 
hour by his daughter zindzi and her two children as well as by 
his sister leaby piliso it was the mandelas first reunion since 
august 
mrs mandela declined to comment on political issues but said 
her husbands health was improving 
botha although refusing to be specific has said in recent 
weeks that he hopes mandela will not have to return to pollsmoor 
prison from the hospital government officials have indicated 
mandela might be freed without having to comply with bothas 
longstanding demand that he renounce violence 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 he received a life sentence 
in 1964 for plotting an anc sabotage campaign aimed at toppling the 
whiteminority government 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire said after meeting with 
botha on oct 1 that the south african president had promised to 
release mandela unconditionally botha refused to confirm this but 
a progovernment newspaper the citizen subsequently quoted 
officials as saying mandela could be released at any time starting 
in midnovember 
mandela is the most popular leader among south africas 
disenfranchised black majority government officials are wary that 
his release could cause a new outbreak of black militancy and 
unrest but they also perceive that freeing mandela could ease 
international pressure on south africa 
in other developments 
an explosion early today outside a police barracks in 
kathlehong a black township near johannesburg caused damage but 
no injuries the blast came 10 hours after a limpet mine exploded 
at a johannesburg bus depot injuring four people most of the 
roughly 80 bombings in south africa this year have been blamed by 
police on the african national congress 
govan mbeki 78 an anc leader freed last year after 23 years 
in prison lost a court bid friday to overturn restrictions placed 
on him after his release the activist a codefendant of 
mandelas had challenged the legality of the emergency regulations 
under which his restrictions were imposed

iran has closed its border to kurdish 
refugees fleeing iraq through turkey a turkish official said iran 
said today that accepting more kurdish refugees would be a problem 
regional gov hayri kozakcioglu said friday that iran took in 
2178 kurdish refugees from turkey one month ago but then closed 
its border 
kozakcioglu said 3000 kurdish refugees were taken this week in 
buses and trucks from two tent cities in southeast turkey to alan 
a village on the iranian border but the iranians refused to accept 
the refugees he said and after a twoday wait at the border they 
were taken back to the tent cities 
turkish news agencies say up to 19000 kurdish refugees have 
voluntarily transferred to iran 
irans deputy prime minister alireza moayeri was quoted today 
by irans official islamic republic news agency as saying due to 
early cold weather in the western border regions the arrival of 
fresh groups of kurds will be difficult and dangerous 
iran had offered to accept any of the 60000 kurdish refugees 
who poured into turkey starting in late august after iraq began an 
offensive against the ethnic minority the kurds claim iraq used 
chemical weapons against them 
moayeri was quoted as saying iran has accepted 100000 kurdish 
refugees fleeing iraq since an aug 20 ceasefire in the 8yearold 
iraniraq war the tehran government backed kurdish separatists in 
iraq during the fighting 
taking more refugees will entail more problems for the refugees 
and for iran moayeri was quoted as saying by irna monitored in 
nicosia cyprus 
irna said thursday that 32000 kurdish refugees from turkey have 
sought sanctuary in northwest iran including nearly 8000 the last 
few days because of ankaras reluctance to host them 
kozakcioglu denied the report saying such a legal transfer 
was impossible as long as iran kept its border closed 
but he said turkey would not be able to control illegal 
crossings into iran because of the rough border terrain 
last week 1467 kurds returned voluntarily from turkey to iraq 
which has offered an amnesty to those who fled the rest of the 
kurdish refugees are settled in five tent cities in southeastern 
turkey

mohawk indians briefly blocked 
the seaway international bridge to the united states to protest a 
police raid on suspected drug and cigarette smugglers in the 
akwesasne indian reserve 
the indians used their cars friday night to block the bridge for 
about 10 minutes in both directions and nailed a sign to an 
immigration booth that read this is indian land mohawk land 
no trespassing 
the bridge connects cornwall island in the st lawrence seaway 
with mainland canada to the north and new york to the south the 
reserve where 100000 indians live is located on the island 
the raid was carried out thursday by 250 heavily armed canadian 
police with 75 cruisers 15 vans unmarked cars helicopters 
boats bulldozers and dogs trained to sniff out illegal drugs 
seven people were arrested and large quantities of illegal 
cigarettes some drugs and weapons worth 200000 were seized 
police said the raid was one of the largest in the 18month 
attempt to stop mohawk indians from bringing dutyfree cigarettes 
from the united states for resale in canada 
some indians called for retaliation we were raped said 
francis boot a bus driver whose home was one of 12 raided on the 
island it was no different than if the us 7th cavalry had 
come across and attacked us 
boots scoffed at the police description of what was seized 
describing it instead as some cigarettes and a couple of useless 
pistols but police said their search turned up restricted 
weapons marijuana and cocaine 
mohawk grand chief mike mitchell appealed for calm among his 
people but boots said he and others have contacted our brothers 
and sisters in new york and montreal to join in meetings to 
discuss a unified reaction to the raid 
the raid was similar to one in may in the kahnawake reserve just 
south of montreal in which 17 people were arrested for selling 
illegal cigarettes

if you woke up bored dont go back to bed quite yet oct 16th 
has a better chance than most days of finding a significant niche 
in history and youd feel awful if you missed it 
the date has started and ended eras scrambled the balance of 
power and marched us off toward war or to the edge of it 
there are other days of historical coincidence that loom large 
of course 
there was july 4 and not just because of the independence 
said robert sellen professor of american history at georgia state 
university 
john adams and thomas jefferson died on july 4 exactly 50 years 
after the signing sellen noted and people marveled at this at 
the time these two old heroes of independence dying together 
it was seen as a symbol nobody was sure of what 
neither is anybody sure why all of these beginnings and endings 
fell on oct 16 
in 1793 queen marie antoinette whose extravagance and let 
them eat cake attitude toward the poor made her a symbol and 
cause of the french revolution went to the guillotine in paris it 
was the end of the old order and france would never be the same 
again with the stability of the continents monarchies in 
question neither would europe 
in 1815 napoleon bonaparte arrived at the island of saint 
helena off the west african coast where he was exiled after his 
loss to the british at waterloo the exile gave some finality 
again to the end of the napoleonic wars that shredded europe 
earlier he escaped from exile on elba off the coast of italy and 
nearly regained his power this time he stayed put and died on 
saint helena in 1821 
in 1846 a boston dentist william morton demonstrated the use 
of ether as an anesthetic during a jaw operation try to imagine 
medicine today without that first step 
in 1859 abolitionist john brown led his raid on the federal 
arsenal at harpers ferry va now wva in what was to have 
triggered a slave uprising it didnt and brown went to the 
gallows six weeks later the memory of brown and his raid became a 
rallying cry to turn out northern support for the war against the 
confederacy 
in 1916 margaret sanger opened the first birth control clinic 
in the united states on the revolutionary some said blasphemous 
contention that the poor should be able to control the size of 
their families she founded planned parenthood which has 
influenced the lives of millions 
in 1946 10 nazi war criminals who personified the worst of 
hitlers outrages were hanged in germany 
in 1962 the cuban missile crisis began with president kennedy 
ordering a blockade of cuba that brought the united states and the 
soviet union as close to nuclear war as they have ever been the 
soviets agreed to remove the missiles and kennedy lifted the 
blockade 
in 1964 china became the fifth member of the nuclear club 
exploding its first atomic bomb near sinkiang 
in 1970 anwar sadat who defied his moslem neighbors and was

iran has accepted 100000 kurdish 
refugees fleeing from iraq and accepting more would be a problem 
an iranian official was quoted saturday as saying 
the official islamic republic news agency quoted alireza 
moayeri deputy prime minister as saying due to early cold 
weather in the western border regions the arrival of fresh groups 
of kurds will be difficult and dangerous 
a kurdish spokesman said thursday that turkey has forced 30000 
kurds into iran last week where they were crammed into overcrowded 
camps 
moayeri spent friday in turkey discussing the refugee problem 
with prime minister turgut ozal foreign minister mesut yilmaz and 
other government officials said irna monitored in nicosia it 
said moayeri described the talks as friendly 
a turkish offical said friday that iran closed its border with 
turkey to prevent any more crossings by kurdish refugees who fled 
iraq during an army offensive against them the kurds said they 
were fleeing chemical bomb attacks 
regional gov hayri kozakcioglu said that iran received 2178 
kurdish refugees from turkey a month ago but then closed its border 
to the refugees saying it had no shelter for them 
iraq started its offensive against the kurds in august soon 
after iran agreed to the ceasefire in the 8yearold iraniran 
war the kurds who are seeking autonomy for their region sided 
with iran during the war 
moyaeri criticized the world reaction to the kurdish claims of 
chemical bomb attacks 
unfortunately the world has not shown a proper reaction to the 
iraqi atrocities against the kurds he said neither iran nor 
turkey have received aid for the kurdish refugees 
taking more refugees will entail more problems for the refugees 
and for iran moayeri said he said both countries will try to work 
for improved existing conditions for the refugees 
about 20 million kurds live in the mountainous region where the 
borders of turkey iran and iraq converge they have fought 
periodically in all three countries for more than 80 years for 
autonomy

in the bustling markets that line the 
dusty winding alleys and the parched kabul river war seems far 
away until one looks at the clear sunny sky 
helicopters chug inside the perimeter of mountains whose ridges 
are lined with radar installations and outposts of afghan and 
soviet armed forces 
attack jets and big military transport planes drop flares 
designed to divert heatseeking missiles 
just beyond the ridges are moslem guerrillas battling the 
soviet troops and the forces of afghanistans sovietstyle 
government 
most days at least a few rockets are launched at the capital 
usually landing in random fashion on homes streets and sometimes 
in or near a military installation 
we dont know when or where they will come said a young 
civil servant who recently returned from the soviet union where she 
studied russian and english they can kill you they can kill me 
they can kill someone else 
on the outskirts of the city soviet and afghan troops man 
concrete bunker checkpoints closer to the center there are afghan 
checkpoints 
but in the marketplace theres little feeling of imminent 
disaster 
men in brown robes and white turbans sit crosslegged in front 
of piles of purplishblack onions red tomatoes and oblong melons 
a onelegged man on crutches sells gaudily colored skipantstyle 
long underwear in anticipation of winter in this city where 
nighttime temperatures are already nippy 
a kabul university student wheels his bicycle along the potholed 
lanes his 7yearold daughter seated on the crossbar 
there is so much fighting he said the soviets must leave 
our country 
the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan began four months ago 
and the remaining 50000 to 60000 soviet soldiers are scheduled to 
be gone by feb 15 1989 under a united nationsmediated agreement 
signed in geneva last april 
the student spoke in english he said he had learned from classes 
at the american cultural center classes that ended after the 
soviet union dispatched troops to afghanistan in 1979 to support a 
communist regime under attack from the guerrillas 
at the kabul zoo packs of small boys a few families and 
turbaned tajik tribesmen who just arrived from the soviet border 
province of jawzjan wander around the dusty park staring at 
colorful birds rabbits and a wearylooking elephant 
the small boys were more intrigued by the lone foreigner in the 
zoo than by the animals when they learned the foreigner was 
american not soviet they led the way to the enclosure of a 
russian brown bear 
giggling and pointing at the shaggy beast they chanted 
sharabi sharabi the dari word for soviet 
the crowd thinned out with the approach of a man in a thick 
graygreen woolen uniform and a sovietdesigned pistol tucked in 
his waistband 
he identified himself as habib a veterinarian and a member of 
the peoples democratic party of afghanistan that has dominated the 
government for the last decade 
the party is the right way habib said 
he had spent the last three months in kandahar a southern 
provincial capital under siege by the antigovernment guerrillas 
he said he was neither a soldier nor a policeman but he 
declined to explain the significance of his militarystyle uniform 
that carried no insignia 
asked if he was worried now that soviet troops are withdrawing 
from afghanistan habib said he did not fear the guerrillas 
i am not afraid of the mujahedeen if a mujahed wants to kill 
me i will kill him 
but habib said he has not returned to his home province of 
kapisa on the northeast edge of kabul province for several years 
he said he came from a part of kapisa near the panjshir valley 
which is held by one of the most powerful local rebel commanders 
ahmad shah masood 
the mujahedeen killed by brother habib said if i go 
back they may kill me because i am with the government

with their striped shirts and academic 
degrees israels new yuppie politicians have traded the 
roughandtumble moshe dayan style for a more imageconscious 
approach 
the new generation running in the nov 1 elections range in 
background from sons of leaders to lawyers to sephardi immigrants 
from poor backgrounds in north africa 
among the candidates are men with wellknown names like benjamin 
begin son of former prime minister menachem begin and 
lesserknown figures like yossi beilin who gained experience as an 
aide to labor party leader and foreign minister shimon peres 
the leaders next in line for both parties are more pragmatic 
than their ideologybound predecessors about israels biggest 
problem the palestinians 
they also have parted with the old world manners and casual 
openshirt dress of firstgeneration israeli politicians such as 
david bengurion soldier and politician dayan or defense minister 
yitzhak rabin 
we dont kiss a ladys hand like our mentors did said roni 
milo 39 a rising star with the rightist likud bloc who who was 
referring to the sometimes courtly behavior of polishborn menachem 
begin founder of the likud 
were more direct sabra style and more pragmatic we young 
people are more capable of growing accustomed to new conditions 
milo added flashing a boyish smile 
milos background is typical of many politicians his age of 
european descent he is a sabra a nativeborn israel and a lawyer 
who did party work in student government at tel aviv university he 
inherited hawkish political beliefs from parents who fought the 
british in begins irgun underground 
his career flourished after he won a seat in parliament in 1977 
with a likud victory in national elections 
a second likud deputy with leadership potential is ehud olmert 
42 also a lawyer who despite his hard line on the arabisraeli 
conflict has maintained quiet contacts with palestinians from the 
occupied territories 
we have a more pragmatic approach olmert said of himself 
and his generation in likud yes were against the plo but we 
know we have to strike an agreement with the palestinians 
unlike likuds younger politicians most of the new faces who 
are certain to win election from the rival labor party will be 
taking their first parliament seats after next months vote 
although they lack legislative experience some newcomers 
already have considerable influence 
beilin 40 is a former cabinet secretary with a doctorate in 
political science who became an adviser to peres a decade ago he 
also is more moderate than peres toward the palestinians i am 
willing to speak to the plo provided that it meets conditions of 
recognizing israel and formally declaring a ban on terrorism 
israels government objects to any dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization claiming it is a terrorist organization 
another fresh face in labor avraham burg 33 is the son of 
yosef burg who until he retired last year was religious affairs 
minister and the longestserving member of israels knesset or 
parliament 
the younger burg also a former adviser to peres insists his 
father had nothing to do with his decision to enter politics 
instead it was opposition to israels threeyear war in lebanon 
that got him interested 
burg was injured in parachute training in 1979 but he fought as 
a volunteer with his unit in lebanon in 1982 then became a leading 
opponent of israels lebanon war 
i never thought before of being a politician he said but 
then i thought we are a society undergoing many processes some of 
them difficult incorrect fatal either you bury your head deep in 
the sand or you try to do something 
burg the spokesman for labors campaign says resolving the 
palestinian uprising in the disputed west bank and gaza strip is 
one of israels main necessities 
the occupation corrupts us this is a tough process the 
israeli population is going through the main moral issue is ending 
the occupation and finding a solution 
the other pattern of developing leadership in labor and likud 
are the smalltown mayors mostly of sephardi origin who now have 
prominent places on both parties slates 
moroccanborn eli dayan 38 the mayor of ashkelon is an 
example from labor 
dayan who is not related to the late israeli war hero told 
reporters recently that he saw his achievements as a boost to the 
nations disadvantaged development towns that are home mostly to 
middle eastern or north african jews 
at one time these parties were closed to the people from these 
towns he said now we can be candidates for the knesset 
some israeli analysts believe the new generation of politicians 
is too willing to compromise and lacks the ideological vision of 
the countrys founders 
theyre all the same whether in labor or likud yuppies and 
opportunists said gabi sheffer a political scientist at hebrew 
university in jerusalem theyre the product of growing 
materialism in israeli society they reflect the less idealistic 
society we have become

former presidential candidate barry goldwater 
says george bush may have impugned the patriotism of michael 
dukakis in a campaign he says has been so negative that as an 
american citizen im dammned concerned about where were going 
he urged both bush and dukakis to quit calling each other 
names and concentrate on important issues such as how they would 
handle the nations huge debt and federal budget deficits 
in an interview goldwater who retired two years ago as 
arizonas senior republican senator said also he believes sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas has stronger qualifications to become 
president than does bushs running mate sen dan quayle rind 
but goldwater also said of bush i dont think ive known a 
man in my life who comes to the chance of being president who is 
better qualified 
he believes bush will win rather big carrying half or more 
of the 50 states and added i think i know generally what george 
bush stands for im very much for him i think hell make a good 
president 
while goldwater said he was surprised by the choice of quayle 
he is very prejudiced in the 41yearold senators favor 
because he has known him and his family for years and thought 
quayle did a superb job in handling a senate armed services 
panel on military procurement 
goldwater admitted that despite his closeness to quayle the 
question of whether the hoosier senator is equipped to be 
president should he ever be called on to do so is an obvious one 
he said it is an impossible question to answer and raised the 
possibility that like harry truman quayle might grow with the 
job should it become necessary 
ill admit this goldwater volunteered the man running 
for vice president on the democrat ticket is i think a little 
better equipped 
ive known him longer goldwater said of bentsen hes 
been in the senate longer and hes bound to have picked up many 
things that quayle hasnt had a chance to pick up 
goldwater 79 said he is ready to return to phoenix having 
just sold the washington apartment he occupied for decades he is 
publicizing his new autobiography goldwater a tartly worded 
view of his life and the personalities with whom he has worked and 
clashed in a career which spanned four decades 
goldwater who was subjected to harshly negative campaign 
advertisements during his 1964 presidential campaign against lyndon 
johnson made no secret of his distaste for the 1988 campaign 
i dont like the campaign from what ive seen of it and heard 
of it goldwater said i dont think that either man has been 
talking about the issues 
he said this and the negative tone of the campaign has resulted 
in widespread apathy which he said may result for the first time 
in history of a turn out of less than 50 percent of the nations 
registered voters 
in last weeks debate bush said goldwater couldnt know what 
the issues are because the press has not been reporting on them 
goldwater had asked quayle to tell george bush to start talking 
about the issues 
george took after me asking how i could know what was going 
on when i was living way out in arizona goldwater said and 
added youd be surprised at what we know out there 
responding to questions goldwater refered to both bush and 
dukakis and said i think the whole camaign has been negative 
they both denied that saying they had put out position 
papers he said nobody reads position papers 
ive been giving both candidates a bad time for this negative 
campaiging at a very very important time in our historyas an 
american citizen im just damned concerned about where were 
going 
goldwater was asked about bushs attack on dukakis for the 
governors veto of legislation requiring all massachusetts school 
children to recite the pledge of allegiance 
calling the pledge a very big part of americana goldwater 
added i dont think it deserved spending more than one or two 
lectures on 
then referring to other aspects of the bush attack goldwater 
said the gop candidate talked about the dirt in the harbors in 
massachusetts the fact that dukakis has given leave to convicted 
murderers 
thats not going to bother the guy out in timbuktu he said 
that guy wants to know how the hell are we going to get out of 
debt 
he said he was not able to respond with certainty to the 
question of whether bush has impugned the integrity of michael 
dukakis 
but after a pause he added i have a hunch that he probably 
has 
what does that say about the shape of american presidential 
politics 
bad shape goldwater replied it doesnt speak well for 
the political system the american people do not like negative 
advertising or negative campaigning theyd like to be told whats 
on these fellows minds about how to get the country in order

scotland yard appointed the head of its serious 
crimes branch saturday to investigate a tabloids publication of a 
private royal family photograph 
but a conservative party lawmaker criticized the appointment of 
such a high officer saying it is like sending in commandos to nab 
a parking offender 
commander roy penrose 46 former head of the drug squad will 
lead an inquiry to discover how the sun a 415millioncirculation 
newspaper obtained the snapshot of the queen her mother 
elizabeth and the duchess of york cradling her infant daughter 
princess beatrice 
the conservative lawmaker geoffrey dickens protested the 
gilbert and sullivan situation in which scotland yard assigned 
penrose to deal with this piddling affair 
we must presume that the lord high executioner is waiting in 
the wings to do his stuff when the hapless culprit is found it is 
like sending in the sas commandos to deal with a parking 
offender he said 
after the picture appeared on the front page of thursdays sun 
the queen told her lawyers to consider action against the paper 
buckingham palace said it was taken by an unidentified friend of 
the royal family and was published without the permission of the 
queen or any member of the royal family or the person who took the 
photograph 
the sun defied the queen by again publishing the photo in its 
first edition on friday but withdrew it from later editions and 
offered to return it when it is established who is the owner 
the paper promised not to publish it again or reproduce it 
elsewhere 
in an editorial saturday the sun said its crime was to 
publish a delightful picture that readers loved and that the 
queen should have been proud to share with her subjects 
the paper said it was hurt by the palaces reaction but 
apologized sorry maam no offense meant the sun gave no 
explanation of how the picture was obtained 
the appointment of commander penrose was announced in a 
onesentence scotland yard statement 
buckingham palace refused to comment saying only that it was 
advised that scotland yard was investigating the matter 
dickens said he planned to ask home secretary douglas hurd who 
is in charge of the police to issue guidelines on the sensible 
use of police resources 
buckingham palace has released only a few official photos of 
princess beatrice the queens fifth grandchild who was born on 
aug 8 they were taken by the babys father prince andrew the 
queens second son 
although posed the photo which appeared in the sun was informal 
and relaxed showing the queen and her mother in scottish tartans 
under british law copyright on a photograph lies with the 
photographer 
television news programs when reporting the controversy have 
blacked out the picture when showing the suns front page 
the first recorded case of the royal family going to the courts 
was in 1911 when king george v brought a libel action against an 
antiroyalist who claimed in a paris paper that the king married an 
admirals daughter 20 years earlier

the scams were so familiar that at times a 
federal prosecutor had to remind himself he was trailing a major 
defense contractor and not just another smalltime operator 
feeding at the public trough 
the fraud investigation of the sundstrand corp revealed the 
destruction of memos and internal reports creative accounting 
favors paid to government officials hidden ownership even a 
charge to the government for personal expenses like golfing and dog 
kennel fees 
it was an easy path to follow for a federal prosecutor schooled 
in the shenanigans of chicagos city hall 
i think as in most public corruption cases the people at 
sundstrand developed the attitude that these kinds of things were 
part of the cost of doing business us attorney anton valukas 
said 
they probably thought that prosecution would be too complex 
or that the government wouldnt follow through or that even if 
the company did get caught it could settle up civilly 
but we took the same approach we take in other corruption 
cases and by the time you factor in the additional problems of 
criminal charges it becomes so expensive that they wont even look 
at this kind of thing any more 
sundstrand agreed on wednesday to plead guilty to a fourcount 
criminal complaint charging that it overbilled the pentagon for 
airplane parts and to pay 115 million in fines and penalties the 
largest fraud settlement ever 
the defense department accounts for 42 percent of sundstrands 
14 billion in annual sales 
the company has declined to comment on the plea agreement 
except to say it was a step toward putting the scandal behind it 
but the matter may be far from over a federal grand jury is 
considering charges against sundstrand employees and there remains 
the possibility of further administrative fines against the 
rockfordbased company and the suspension of its right to bid on 
future defense contracts 
the plea agreement revealed several separate schemes to defraud 
the government it also indicated that improprieties climbed at 
least into the supervisory level and possibly higher 
company officials set out to get contracts in instances where 
they knew well in advance they couldnt perform for the fixed 
price valukas said what flowed from that were a number of 
different attempts to hide the overruns 
the complaint alleges those practices continued from august 1981 
through june 1985 but that sundstrand employees were ordered in 
april 1984 to destroy an internal report and work papers that 
suggested management officials were aware they were not complying 
with government regulations 
of even longerstanding practice was sundstrands willingness to 
pay gratuities ranging from wine to theater tickets to golf 
outings to defense department personnel to win business and then 
hide the government employees names the employees were not 
identified in the complaint 
a 1980 company directive ordered that the names be given to 
supervisors orally or in writing on small slips of paper that were 
immediately destroyed and even after the pentagon issued new rules 
on gratuities for defense officials sundstrand told supervisors 
that salesmen could continue to write customer on their expense 
accounts instead of the public employees names 
the complaint also charges sundstrand engaged in a third 
coverup moving spare aircraft parts to a warehouse owned by a 
wisconsin company then concealing the extent of its ownership to 
prevent the internal revenue service from disallowing millions of 
dollars in tax writeoffs 
a fourth count charged that other overhead accounts submitted to 
the government attempted to disguise luxuries for sundstrand 
executives ranging from saunas and radar detectors to snow plowing 
and servants 
the federal charges were not the first indication that something 
was wrong 
col francis holland chicago regional commander of defense 
contract administration services told the chicago tribune that 
government auditors had uncovered millions of dollars in 
improprieties by late 1982 
and he said internal audit memos that made the rounds at the 
company should have raised red flags as well 
no one in sundstrand can say gee whiz this is just a minor 
thing and no one paid any attention to it holland recalled 
yet his agency which monitors contracts after they are awarded 
by other sections of the defense department negotiated with 
sundstrand for two years on how much the company should repay the 
government before turning to criminal investigators

maps of the soviet union that long have been 
classified for fear they might help spies or saboteurs will be made 
public next year a newspaper reported saturday 
the secret stamp is being removed to permit printing of 
457 new maps and atlases based on the classified charts with 249 
titles scheduled to be printed in 1989 alone the sovietskaya 
rossiya daily said 
until very recently anyone who managed to see them could 
be condemned as an enemy of the people it said 
the chief soviet mapmaker viktor r yashchenko told the 
government newspaper izvestia last month that roads rivers and 
even entire towns had been intentionally misplaced or left off 
public maps over the past halfcentury under orders of the secret 
police 
he said the distortions began in the 1930s under soviet leader 
josef stalin and continued until this year 
people did not recognize their own homeland on maps he said 
at the time tourists tried in vain to orient themselves to 
locations 
sovietskaya rossiya said the new more detailed maps stemmed 
from glasnost the drive for openness pushed by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
among the new titles planned are a road atlas collections of 
maps of cities including moscow and leningrad and hikers atlases 
for the caucasus mountains and the coasts of the black sea and sea 
of azov the newspaper said

a senior soviet diplomat arrived in 
kabul on saturday to take up his post as ambassador in an 
indication of moscows desire to retain a strong influence over its 
southern neighbor 
a soviet embassy official said first deputy foreign minister 
yuli vorontsov would present his credentials to the afghan 
government within three days 
he spoke on condition of anonymity and said he was unable to 
give any details of vorontsovs schedule 
vorontsov has worked closely with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze who in turn is close to president mikhail gorbachev 
such senior kremlin officials rarely double as foreign ambassadors 
the change coincides with a steppedup soviet and afghan 
campaign for a negotiated end to the fighting that has pitted 
afghan and soviet troops against us and pakistanbacked moslem 
guerrillas 
last week the soviet union pledged 800 million to the un 
fund for rebuilding afghanistan nearly half the 2 billion the 
united nations says is needed in the next five years 
moscow radios englishlanguage program heard in kabul on 
saturday noted that the soviet union had pledged such a large sum 
while according to the broadcast the united states was slow to 
respond with a similar amount 
an expected meeting of the central committee of the peoples 
democratic party of afghanistan has prompted speculation among both 
western and nonwestern diplomats that a change in party leadership 
may be forthcoming 
president najib heads the afghan government and is also 
secretarygeneral of the party 
a veteran nonwestern diplomat said he doubted the soviet union 
would want to see a new afghan president until the red armys 
withdrawal is completed 
why should they want the government to change before they get 
their children home he asked 
under the unmediated agreement worked out in april in geneva 
the soviet union is to complete the withdrawal of its troops by 
feb 15 1989 the withdrawal started may 15 and is now half over 
with an estimated 50000 to 60000 soviet soldiers remaining in 
afghanistan 
the soviet union intervened in afghanistan in december 1979

george bush riding the momentum of last 
weeks debate will focus on proven themes and big states as he 
tries to hold or expand his lead in the final three weeks of the 
presidential campaign aides say 
they say he will not stray far from the themes he has already 
honed on the campaign trail crime the death penalty prison 
furloughs in massachusetts a strong military and will break 
little if any new ground on issues 
although bush is enjoying a widening lead in public opinion 
polls over democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis he and 
his top campaign officials are insisting they will not permit 
themselves to become complacent 
thats the last thing i want to have happen bush said at 
weeks end as it became clear his campaign was enjoying a 
postdebate surge 
while maintaining a busy schedule bush can be expected to run a 
cautious playitsafe campaign in the days ahead 
that means sticking to his basic campaign stump speech speaking 
mostly before friendly audiences having few news conferences and 
seldom departing from a wellrehearsed script 
bush himself told reporters i dont feel any pressure to put 
out a lot of new programs at this stage in the campaign weve 
got a lot of programs out there 
he conceded that youll see a lot of similarity in his 
campaign speeches in the next three weeks with the triedandtested 
themes hes been hammering on since the republican convention last 
august 
above all bush as well as his top advisers are saying they will 
take nothing for granted 
asked by reporters how he assessed the debate he said at one 
point read my smile 
but he also said youre talking to a guy who when the polls 
were going the other way said it isnt over and it wasnt so 
why should i now suddenly have the luxury of changing my position 
watch how hard we work bush said echoing the sentiment of 
his campaign chairman james a baker iii who cautioned senior 
aides on friday to above all else avoid becoming cocky or 
viewing a bush election as inevitable 
theres a 100 percent chance of getting into trouble if you 
get smug and overconfident added campaign manager lee atwater 
we dont intend to do that 
bush in the coming days will travel mostly to large states where 
polls show the election remains close 
after leaving california where he has been since last tuesday 
and where the stakes may be the highest in the country bush plans 
campaign visits in pivotal midwestern states 
aides also said bush plans to keep returning to new jersey and 
will even spend some time campaigning in new york where recent 
polls suggest the states 36 electoral votes may be within striking 
distance despite a wide early lead by dukakis 
were going to concentrate on the electoral college 
california new york ohio illinois new jersey atwater said 
the vice presidents base is secure in the south and the west 
bill lacy bushs california coordinator said the vice 
presidents performance in last thursdays debate which generally 
got high marks from americans responding to a variety of surveys 
will help in california 
still the state with its rich bounty of 47 electoral votes is 
still up for grabs lacy said in an interview 
he noted that bush at one point last summer had been as much as 
18 points behind in california but he said polls in the last 
few weeks have shown it to be a very close race so were going to 
keep pressing and keep pushing as hard as we can 
bush will also be courting the reagan democrats 
traditionally democratic voters many of them bluecollar workers 
who bolted in 1980 and 1984 to vote for president reagan 
early polls showed many of these democrats were not ready to 
give the same support to bush but more recent surveys suggest some 
are moving in that direction 
bush will spend most of this week in the midwest and much of 
the campaigning particularly in industrial areas will be aimed at 
these reagan democrats 
they respond to issues like crime prison furloughs gun 
control defense the death penalty the nuclear freeze and the 
aclu atwater said bush needs 35 percent of the reagan 
democrats to win the election and hes in the neighborhood of 50 
percent now

michael dukakis strategy of containing george 
bushs builtin campaign advantage in the south and west appears to 
be crumbling rapidly as republicans paint him as an unreconstructed 
liberal according to the polls and political experts 
dukakis advisers reject any talk of a gop electoral college 
lock in these reliably republican regions but they concede 
that bushs aggressive campaign television commercials included 
has forced them to scramble to remain competitive in even a 
relative handful of states 
one adviser charlie baker says the talk of a solid republican 
south is a calculated attempt by the bush campaign to create an 
impression that the race is over and thus discourage voters from 
going to the polls they believe that if more people vote they 
lose he said 
if they had a lock in the west george bush wouldnt be 
spending two days in colorado he said citing one example of a 
close state 
still polls do indicate bush has solidified his position in the 
south and west in the past few weeks and dukakis has clearly cut 
back efforts in some states including florida though maintaining 
a costly effort in running mate lloyd bentsens texas as well as a 
few scattered others 
merle black a political scientist at the university of north 
carolina believes dukakis efforts to control the southern damage 
are doomed 
i think youre going to see bush sweep the region he said 
in a prediction before thursday nights debate in which the vice 
president was rated a winner 
depending on which side is doing the counting bushs builtin 
advantage in the two regions runs to 100 to 170 electoral votes or 
so out of 270 needed for victory thats a powerful foundation on 
which to base his nationwide campaign and dukakis has nothing 
comparable 
black said voters in the south are suspicious about liberals 
and people who want to use the federal government to change their 
lives and george bush has been able to capitalize 
in part he said thats the residue of racial tension from 
civil rights battles the more blacks there are relative to 
whites the more conservative the whites tend to be he said 
he also said bushs strength results in part from the social 
conservatism of voters in the area on issues such as gun control 
and the pledge of allegiance 
says bush southern adviser lanny griffith ronald reagan has 
done a lot to leave the sunbelt as a republicanbased region in the 
presidential election its real important that in the first 
election after reagan we were able to put that together again 
in the west bush adviser tom hockaday says democrats feel 
ideological differences with candidates on the national ticket 
that cause them to vote republican he said democratic governors 
and senators tend to be more conservative than presidential 
candidates and issues such as water rights gun control and the 
death penalty highlight the differences between bush and dukakis 
griffith ticks off a string of campaign issues that he says the 
vice president has highlighted crime death penalty gun 
control the furlough program in massachusetts national defense 
values like prayer in public schools the pledge of allegiance 
contra aid these are all stronger the further south you get 
among the border states he said arkansas and kentucky were two 
where dukakis remained competitive through late last week 
democrats counter that going into last weeks debate they were 
ahead in arkansas and competitive in kentucky tennessee north 
carolina and texas in each of those states dukakis is airing 
television commercials beyond his national advertising 
in several of the states dukakis seems to have been helped by 
lingering questions about bushs running mate dan quayle democrats 
rushed to leak poll results after the vice presidential debate that 
they said showed bushs texas margin cut from about a dozen points 
to six 
bush has a rocky mountain lead as well dukakis aides claim 
hopes in montana colorado new mexico and the dakotas but have 
little or no hope in arizona idaho wyoming nevada and utah 
a washington post analysis of a recent 50state poll taken with 
abc news rated only arkansas still a tossup among the southern and 
border states the rest were all either rated as clear advantages 
to bush or leaning his way the situation was similar in the rocky 
mountain west colorado and montana were the only states not 
consigned to the bush column 
dukakis picked a texan as his running mate in an attempt to gain 
an instant boost in the southern polls and explicitly drew a 
parallel to john kennedys selection of texan lyndon johnson in his 
winning 1960 campaign 
but republicans point to changes in voting patterns since 1960 
when kennedy and johnson carried louisiana arkansas alabama 
georgia south carolina and north carolina and 1964 when johnson 
scored a landslide 
since then democratic successes in the south have been few and 
far between highlighted by 1976 when georgian jimmy carter 
carried most of his native region 
the story is similar in the west where democats have fared even 
less well than in the south in the last quarter century carter 
failed to carry a single state west of texas except for hawaii even 
in his winning campaign in 1976

in his two months as attorney general dick 
thornburgh has disappointed a number of conservatives who feel he 
has tried to get political mileage out of making what they regard 
as veiled attacks on his predecessor edwin meese iii 
thornburgh denies suggestions that any of his actions have been 
aimed at meese who the former pennsylvania governor has known 
since the early days of the reagan administration when meese was 
white house counselor 
what i have tried to do is to dampen the enthusiasm for ed 
meesebashing that seemed to be prevailing prior to my coming 
here thornburgh said in an interview friday if anybodys 
going to be bashed it ought to be me im the attorney general i 
can take it 
thornburghs ethics speech earlier this month didnt mention 
meese but annoyed several conservatives who felt it dredged up 
memories of the 14month criminal investigation of meese which 
ended in july the speech calls for a review of justice department 
ethics policies 
independent counsel james mckay decided he wouldnt seek meeses 
indictment but concluded meese had probably twice violated 
conflictofinterest laws and tax laws the probe stemmed from 
meeses official acts on behalf of longtime friend e robert 
wallach a lawyer whose clients included scandalplagued wedtech 
corp and a partner in a 1 billion proposed iraqi oil pipeline 
i think thornburgh himself is doing a pretty good job as 
attorney general but theres a difference between putting your own 
imprint on the department and trying to distance yourself from 
previous administrations said eugene hickok a special assistant 
in the office of legal counsel under meese and now a political 
science professor at dickinson college 
what he needs to do is establish his own reputation not say 
how he is different from ed meese and not try to resuscitate 
directly or indirectly the problems of ed meese 
thornburgh insisted he wasnt referring to my predecessor at 
all with the ethics speech he said the springboard for it was a 
recent poll showing widespread public perception of corruption in 
government 
we would be foolish and not serving the president 
appropriately if we were to ignore those perceptions the 
attorney general said 
but some conservatives have questioned thornburghs motives 
i think that some conservatives are concerned that since 
becoming attorney general dick thornburgh has said things which 
have seemed critical not only of his predecessor ed meese but 
the president as well said gary mcdowell vice president of the 
national legal center for the public interest and the former head 
of the justice departments speechwriting unit when meese was 
attorney general 
so far this strikes some as an attorney general possibly more 
sensitive to politics and his own media image than he is dedicated 
to the presidents principles mcdowell said 
in the ethics speech thornburgh said a study is needed of the 
question of how the relationship between the attorney general and 
the president can be both as close as it should be and as correct 
as it ought to be president reagan and meese have worked closely 
together for over two decades 
thornburghs aides emphatically rejected the suggestion that the 
remark targeted the reaganmeese relationship 
ed meese is a friend of mine said thornburgh he always 
treated me well when i was governor ive said time and again 
that i dont propose to look back its necessary to look 
forward to ensure that this department continues to do its job im 
satisfied that were doing that 
thornburgh said he will serve this president until the end of 
this term what i do thereafter in the federal government is up to 
vice president bush if he is as i expect elected 
thornburgh however may make a major change in one piece of the 
meese legacy an order that gives the attorney general the power to 
appoint special prosecutors to investigate members of congress for 
allegations of wrongdoing meese signed the order his last day in 
office 
thornburgh has expressed little enthusiasm for the plan and the 
new attorney general and his aides have discussed possibly 
overturning it 
an observer might conclude from a number of things the new 
attorney general has done that his or his staffs preoccupation is 
that of distancing the new regime from the old one said terry 
eastland the former justice department spokesman who meese fired 
in may reportedly for not defending meese aggressively enough 
eastland said that while the distancing process is 
understandable in certain respects it also may be unwise 
there was much done by meese that in my view had merit

the 1703 billion trade deficit the united 
states suffered last year cost the country 51 million jobs in 
manufacturing and associated services according to a study 
released saturday by a laborbacked research institute 
the economic policy institute sought to determine how many jobs 
would have been created if the record trade deficit had been 
completely eliminated and imports and exports had been in balance 
the report concluded that 51 million jobs had been lost because 
trade was not in balance with 31 million of those jobs in 
manufacturing and the other 2 million in related industries such 
as business services 
the study said the job losses had been spread evenly around the 
country with 143 million in the west 138 million in the midwest 
129 million in the northeast and 104 million in the south 
these calculations make it clear that jobs in every region of 
america are being destroyed and potential jobs not being created 
because of our failure to close the trade deficit said jeff 
faux president of the institute 
but robert ortner commerce undersecretary for economic affairs 
said the study failed to take into account the fact that many 
workers who have lost jobs to foreign competition have found work 
elsewhere 
he said the most recent montly employment report showed there 
are only 66 million people currently listed as unemployed thus 
if the trade deficit was totally eliminated it would wipe out 
virtually all joblessness in the united states ortner said 
saying that 51 million people have lost jobs because of the 
trade deficit is a mindless arithmetic calculation that doesnt 
have economic content he said obviously many of these people 
have gone back to work 
but lawrence mishel research director for the institute 
defended the assumptions used in the study which was prepared for 
the institute by new york universitys institute for economic 
analysis 
he said the results were consistent with other views of the 
impact of the trade deficit which were done for the us 
international trade commission and the congressional office of 
technology assessment 
he said the labor departments unemployment statistics 
understate the jobless figures because they do not adequately track 
the number of people who have given up looking for work or who are 
working at parttime jobs but would rather have full time 
employment 
mishel said the institutes study used an inputoutput model to 
analyze the trade data for example for each bushel of grain 
exported the model computes not only the requirements for farm 
equipment but also the amount of steel absorbed by the 
agricultural equipment manufacturers as well as more indirect 
requirements such as the iron ore and electrical power necessary to 
produce the steel 
the us trade deficit is expected to decline this year by 
almost 40 billion for the first eight months of the year the 
trade deficit has been runing at an annual rate of 138 billion 
while the institute did not attempt to calculate had many jobs 
had been gained so far this year with the trade deficit declining 
the labor department has reported that manufacturing employment has 
increased by 303000 jobs since the beginning of the year 
the institutes study examined the different regions of the 
country to determine what jobs could be gained if the 1987 trade 
deficit was totally elimianted with half of the deficit reduction 
coming from a rise in exports and half of the gain coming from a 
decline in imports 
this was the regional breakdown the study gave for the benefits 
from eliminating the trade deficit 
midwest the region would gain 735800 jobs from greater exports 
and 647300 jobs from lower imports the biggest gains would come 
in machinery and electronic products 
northeast the region would gain 686600 jobs from higher 
exports and 601600 jobs from lower imports the biggest gains 
would come in machinery and electronics 
south the region would gain 536100 exportrelated jobs and 
510200 jobs from reducing imports the largest concentration of 
jobs lost to imports was in light manufacturing primarily textile 
and apparel jobs 
west the region would gain 779500 exportrelated jobs and 
647300 jobs from lower imports most of the jobs lost to import 
compeititon were in machinery electronics and business services

colombias two major parties have agreed 
to reform the constitution proposing to stop the court system from 
letting drug traffickers go unpunished 
another planned change would put a special prosecutor in charge 
of human rights cases clearing the way for a comprehensive 
investigation of more than 800 death squad killings in the past two 
years 
the amended constitution also would allow presidential primary 
elections and end 28 years of each president being required to name 
some cabinet ministers from the opposition party 
the agreement disclosed friday by colombias minister of 
government cesar gaviria ended two years of bitter feuding 
between the liberal and conservative parties on what changes there 
should be in the constitution 
the announcement came after president virgilio barco of the 
liberal party met for eight hours with former president julio cesar 
turbay director of the liberal party and former president misael 
pastrana chief of the conservative party gaviria said 
congress will be asked to approve the constitutional reforms 
before it goes into recess dec 17 gaviria said at a news 
conference the liberal and conservative parties make up 95 percent 
of congress 
a bipartisan congressional committee appointed this year to 
study possible reforms decided that colombias court system should 
be patterned in some ways after the us system 
colombias court system now lets judges investigate cases take 
depositions hear out of court testimony and decide on their own if 
a suspect should be charged or set free 
it is common knowledge that some judges are bribed no major 
drug trafficker has ever been convicted of drug trafficking and 
spent more than a few weeks in jail 
federal prosecutors now play a very small role in colombia 
criminal charges are made by individuals and a chief judge assigns 
investigations to other judges under the new system a federal 
prosecutor would decide who would be charged and would take over 
the investigatory duties 
the constitutional reform committee also envisions a special 
prosecutor for human rights cases each of the death squad cases 
now is investigated by a different judge eliminating the 
possibility of a major federal investigation linking any of the 
cases 
there have been only 12 convictions in death squad cases 
the minister of government said friday that the constitutional 
reforms would allow congress to force a cabinet minister to resign 
congress now has little power constitutional reform would allow 
it to censure a cabinet minister on a vote of confidence 
another major change in colombian politics would be the end of 
the national front a sharing of power between the liberal and 
conservative parties the national front was created 28 years ago 
to end a war between the liberal and conservative parties that took 
more than 250000 lives 
the two parties decided then to alternate the presidency every 
four years with no president being able to succeed himself under 
the agreement each president has had to work with cabinet 
ministers from the opposition party 
the two party leaders also agreed the constitition should allow 
each party to decide before each presidential election if there 
should be a primary election gaviria said

an appellate court removed the judge in 
indias 3 billion civil suit against union carbide corp for the 
bhopal chemical disaster in a ruling widely seen as a major victory 
for the us company 
judge sk seth of the madhya pradesh state appellate court 
ruled thursday that it was most disturbing that bhopal district 
judge mw deo ordered partial compensation for families of bhopal 
victims before completing the trial 
deo refused to comment saturday on the ruling 
the danbury connbased company had requested deos removal 
after the judge last year awarded 270 million as interim relief to 
families of more than 3100 people who died in the 1984 leak at a 
pesticide plant owned by the union carbides indian subsidiary 
we havent seen the judges order yet so we cant comment 
ed van den ameele a carbide spokesman in danbury said saturday 
more than 20000 were injured in the worlds worst chemical 
disaster 
the award was reduced in april this year to 192 million after 
union carbide appealed the ruling saying the court had no power to 
order it to pay interim relief until responsibility for the gas 
leakage is determined 
the government filed suit against union carbide claiming the 
disastrous gas leak at a pesticide factory dec 3 1984 was caused 
by negligence carbide maintains the leakage of poisonous methyl 
isocyanate gas was due to sabotage by a disgruntled employee 
shambhu singh will succeed deo a senior state government 
official said saturday on condition of anonymity 
it was not immediately known if the removal of deo will affect 
the award of interim relief 
the 2yearold case is the worlds largestever civil suit

a mystery haunts the biggest show ever mounted 
of the work of raphaelle peale americas great stilllife painter 
what perplexes art historians is how peale who was born in 
1774 learned to paint fruit cheese and steak like the dutch 
masters of a century or more earlier 
there is no evidence that peale ever saw dutch paintings but 
his work bears an uncanny similarity to them albeit with an 
additional glow and color 
its a puzzle said nicolai cikovsky jr curator of 
american art at the national gallery of art where the peale show 
opens sunday 
linda bantel director of the pennsylvania academy of fine arts 
said there were no museums in peales native philadelphia during 
his youth 
peales father charles willson peale famous for portraits of 
george washington founded the first museum there in 1794 she 
said she has no record of early pennsylvania museums or private 
collections containing any dutch paintings 
the elder peale was his sons only teacher charles peale 
travelled in europe as raphaelle never did and painted occasional 
still lifes 
charles willson peale married three times and had 17 children 
including rembrandt peale who inherited his fathers gift for 
portraits rubens peale and two titian peales one of whom died 
young 
all were named for famous painters as was raphaelle whose 
namesake is spelled raphael a daughter was called angelica 
kauffmann peale after a swiss portraitist 
the younger peale generation was encouraged to do portraits in 
the days before photography a good likeness could earn a painter 
100 raphaelle sold some of his still lifes for 15 and accepted 
services like carpenters work in exchange for others 
last december a small painting by raphaelle peale sold at an art 
auction in new york for a record 495000 
but there was little prestige to painting still lifes in 
raphaelle peales time 
a tame insipid smooth flat mindless imitation of carrots 
good god is this the end of art is this the use of painting 
asked robert haydon an english painter 
peale was a disappointment to his family he married a woman of 
whom his father disapproved fathered six children drank and 
disappeared for long periods leaving his family in poverty during 
one period he appeared to earn more from writing comic verse than 
from painting 
the show will remain in the nations capital until jan 29 then 
it travels to philadelphia where it will be seen at the 
pennsylvania academy of the fine arts from feb 16 through april 16

former presidential candidate barry goldwater 
says george bush may have impugned the patriotism of michael 
dukakis in a campaign he says has been so negative that as an 
american citizen im dammned concerned about where were going 
he urged both bush and dukakis to quit calling each other 
names and concentrate on important issues such as how they would 
handle the nations huge debt and federal budget deficits 
in an interview goldwater who retired two years ago as 
arizonas senior republican senator said also he believes sen 
lloyd bentsen dtexas has stronger qualifications to become 
president than does bushs running mate sen dan quayle rind 
but goldwater also said of bush i dont think ive known a 
man in my life who comes to the chance of being president who is 
better qualified 
he believes bush will win rather big carrying half or more 
of the 50 states and added i think i know generally what george 
bush stands for im very much for him i think hell make a good 
president 
while goldwater said he was surprised by the choice of quayle 
he is very prejudiced in the 41yearold senators favor 
because he has known him and his family for years and thought 
quayle did a superb job in handling a senate armed services 
panel on military procurement 
goldwater admitted that despite his closeness to quayle the 
question of whether the hoosier senator is equipped to be 
president should he ever be called on to do so is an obvious one 
he said it is an impossible question to answer and raised the 
possibility that like harry truman quayle might grow with the 
job should it become necessary 
ill admit this goldwater volunteered the man running 
for vice president on the democrat ticket is i think a little 
better equipped 
ive known him longer goldwater said of bentsen hes 
been in the senate longer and hes bound to have picked up many 
things that quayle hasnt had a chance to pick up 
goldwater 79 said he is ready to return to phoenix having 
just sold the washington apartment he occupied for decades he is 
publicizing his new autobiography goldwater a tartly worded 
view of his life and the personalities with whom he has worked and 
clashed in a career which spanned four decades 
goldwater who was subjected to harshly negative campaign 
advertisements during his 1964 presidential campaign against lyndon 
johnson made no secret of his distaste for the 1988 campaign 
i dont like the campaign from what ive seen of it and heard 
of it goldwater said i dont think that either man has been 
talking about the issues 
he said this and the negative tone of the campaign has resulted 
in widespread apathy which he said may result for the first time 
in history of a turn out of less than 50 percent of the nations 
registered voters 
in last weeks debate bush said goldwater couldnt know what 
the issues are because the press has not been reporting on them 
goldwater had asked quayle to tell george bush to start talking 
about the issues 
george took after me asking how i could know what was going 
on when i was living way out in arizona goldwater said and 
added youd be surprised at what we know out there 
responding to questions goldwater refered to both bush and 
dukakis and said i think the whole camaign has been negative 
they both denied that saying they had put out position 
papers he said nobody reads position papers 
ive been giving both candidates a bad time for this negative 
campaiging at a very very important time in our historyas an 
american citizen im just damned concerned about where were 
going 
goldwater was asked about bushs attack on dukakis for the 
governors veto of legislation requiring all massachusetts school 
children to recite the pledge of allegiance 
calling the pledge a very big part of americana goldwater 
added i dont think it deserved spending more than one or two 
lectures on 
then referring to other aspects of the bush attack goldwater 
said the gop candidate talked about the dirt in the harbors in 
massachusetts the fact that dukakis has given leave to convicted 
murderers 
thats not going to bother the guy out in timbuktu he said 
that guy wants to know how the hell are we going to get out of 
debt 
he said he was not able to respond with certainty to the 
question of whether bush has impugned the integrity of michael 
dukakis 
but after a pause he added i have a hunch that he probably 
has 
what does that say about the shape of american presidential 
politics 
bad shape goldwater replied it doesnt speak well for 
the political system the american people do not like negative 
advertising or negative campaigning theyd like to be told whats 
on these fellows minds about how to get the country in order

time is running short for michael dukakis 
and the democratic presidential nominee still is searching for a 
message that will attract voters in his faltering battle against 
republican george bush 
with just over three weeks left until election day dukakis was 
trailing in the polls and bush appeared to have gained ground in 
the final pesidential campaign debate 
one of the things i have to do obviously is give people a 
better sense of who mike dukakis is the candidate told reporters 
on his campaign plane friday 
it seemed a remarkable admission from a politician who has been 
campaigning for president for the past 18 months 
im expecting to win he said but i think its going to 
be very tight and ive always felt that way 
there were large signs and small that the campaign was 
feverishly looking for a way to turn the tide 
one bit of advice came right after the thursday debate an 
encounter that was clearly a disappointment to the democratic 
campaign 
dukakis vice presidential running mate lloyd bentsen called and 
gave him a pep talk 
the texas senator advised the presidential nominee that it was 
time to get out and campaign flat out until election day 
bentsen has emerged as the dukakis campaigns greatest asset 
with a large majority of voters saying they prefer him to gop vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle 
jibes at quayle remain standard parts of dukakis and bentsen 
campaign speeches 
the value dukakis places on bentsen was seen by the fact that 
right after the debate the texas senator flew to california for a 
joint appearance with the massachusetts governor 
the first signs of change in campaign approach were a new pair 
of commercials that were very different stylistically from the 
often sharpedged ads he had run before 
aides also said every opportunity would be used to get the 
candidate before large television audiences he is ready and eager 
for example to appear on such programs as abcs nightline 
our best messenger is our candidate said deputy campaign 
chairman john sasso 
aides also predicted a far more intense campaign schedule and on 
friday the day after the debate dukakis was on the road from 
eight in the morning to well past midnight 
aides still maintained they had a clear view of the path to 
victory on nov 8 
they talked of the strong grassroots organization built up over 
months and contended the debate had exposed several new areas of 
vulnerability and weakness in bush 
and they could point to the crowd of nearly 10000 that waited 
in the rain in seattle to hear dukakis on friday 
we are poised for a strong last three weeks sasso told a 
postdebate briefing 
the road ahead of us is going to be tough conceded the 
candidate 
advisers admitted that bush commercials attacking dukakis for 
his states program granting prison furloughs and for the pollution 
in boston harbor had put the democratic nominee on the defensive 
the furlough thing has really hurt said steve engelberg a 
political adviser traveling with dukakis to win we have to get 
rid of it and rid of it fast 
dukakis tried to do just that by pointing out that his father 
had once been beaten and robbed and that his brother had been 
killed by a hitandrun driver 
i dont need george bush to tell me about crime he told 
audiences 
the massachusetts governor also cited the federal furlough 
program and specifically the case of a furloughed drug dealer who 
raped and murdered a pregnant woman in arizona 
equally damaging was the boston harbor commercial run by bush 
it showed scenes of sludge and dead fish and said dukakis had 
failed to act promptly to clean up the harbor 
campaign aides conceded that commercial put dukakis on the 
defensive on the environment particularly in california where the 
environment was regarded as dukakis strongest issue 
california campaign aides think a dukakis response commercial 
citing reagan administration cuts in environmental protection 
programs has now neutralized the boston harbor ad 
the new national dukakis commercials are desigmed to deal with a 
perception that he is cold passionless in them dukakis speaks in 
a conversational tone and tries to get across his values 
in one dukakis is in shirtsleeves and sitting on a couch 
its been a few years since kitty and i had children in 
school he says 
then after referring to challenges facing young couples today 
he concludes id want my president to be in touch with the 
things that are important to me and my family

in an effort to preserve the survival of a 
species six of the nearly extinct blackfooted ferret will travel 
tuesday under strict sanitary controls to a prescreened zoo for a 
new captive breeding program 
the tiny weasellike animals were among 34 kits born this 
spring at the wyoming game and fish departments sybille canyon 
captive breeding facility the 58 there are thought to be the only 
blackfooted ferrets in the world 
the ferrets are doing real well and we are at a situation now 
where we feel we have enough ferrets that we can split the sybille 
colony said art reese chief of habitat and technical services 
at the game department 
the ferrets were nearly wiped out in late 1985 when an epidemic 
of canine distemper ran through their last known colony near 
meeteetse biologists managed to save only 18 of the rare animals 
as a result officials had to be sure that the plane chosen to 
fly the six kits had not carried a cat or dog for at least several 
months reese said in an interview friday 
there also will be a 15foot buffer zone around the ferrets on 
the wyoming air national guard plane where no one will be allowed 
to enter he said 
some 17 zoos around the country answered the game departments 
call for captive breeding proposals reese said but just three met 
stringent conditions the department imposed which includes that 
the kits cant be put on display to visitors for fear of exposure 
to disease 
the overriding purpose of sending the animals to other zoos 
is captive breeding he said ferrets are susceptible to 
disease and stress and we didnt want to take that risk 
following a tour of the zoos the department selected henry 
doorly zoo in omaha neb and the national zoo just outside 
washington dc in front royal va the first six kits are flying 
to washington on tuesday and another eight will go to nebraska 
next month 
we only had enough young to go to two reese said so the 
departments third choice the minnesota zoo in minneapolis was 
turned down 
to win the ferrets the zoos had to agree not to do research on 
them without approval of both the wyoming game department and the 
us fish and wildlife service and to fund the breeding program 
reese said 
when the next set of ferrets is taken to omaha next month they 
likely will ride in a van specially conditioned and disinfected for 
the purpose 
the precautions are in keeping with a stringent disease control 
system at sybille reese said 
anyone going in to see the animals at the facility must first 
shower and put on protective gear similar to a hospital isolation 
unit he said 
its worse than the mayo clinic i think thats because you 
have all your eggs in one basket reese said if disease did 
hit you could face extinction of the whole species 
biologists are confident that spreading the population out to 
the other two sites will put the department closer to its goal of 
reintroducing the ferrets in the wild by fiscal year 1991

water experts in this gambling state have 
staked their savings on what is at best an evenodds bet for a wet 
winter draining most of western nevadas droughtdepleted 
reservoirs to keep faucets flowing this fall 
well get through this year but were going to go into next 
year with basically everything empty said bob firth water 
resources manager for westpac utilities 
the principal reservoir for the reno area is lake tahoe the 
scenic resort destination for tourists astride the 
nevadacalifornia border 
its boat docks were on dry land early this summer and thursday 
its feeble flow to reno went dry altogether when its level dropped 
below the spillways for the first time in 11 years 
anticipating the loss of tahoes overflow westpac utilities has 
been tapping donner lake just across the state line in california 
and is pumping as much groundwater as the state will allow to 
supply its 50900 customers around reno 
the reno area is in a stagethree drought alert but more strict 
limits are possible if the winter proves to be dry once again 
already lawn watering is limited to one day a week hosing off 
sidewalks patios and driveways is prohibited and construction 
companies cant use water from hydrants for dust control 
restaurant patrons have to ask for a glass of water 
the winter snowpack in the sierra nevada range which provides 
the summertime water for western nevada through runoff into the 
truckee and carson rivers has been about half of normal the past 
two years 
firth and other members of gov richard bryans 8monthold 
drought committee agree that aboveaverage snowfall in the sierra 
nevada is needed to relieve the drought and begin refilling the 
reservoirs 
theres scientific evidence firth says that the last drought 
lasting as much as three consecutive years in western nevada was 
around 1590 
but bob thompson nevada area manager for the national weather 
service sets the chances for an aboveaverage water year at only 
5050 
along with precipitation of just 395 inches since oct 1 1987 
compared with the normal 75 inches the past summer was the 
warmest in the 118 years that records have been kept in reno 
according to john james state climatologist 
we got clobbered three ways he said a lack of water 
high temperatures and the highest evaporation rates weve seen 
that just wiped us out 
drought committee members agree it would take winter storms 
around 150 percent of average to restore the diminished reservoirs 
but even with a stormy winter were going to have a lot of 
holes to fill firth said 
a snowfall thats just 90 percent of normal would allow westpac 
utilities to meet the reno areas annual 21billiongallon thirst 
with some conservation firth said 
but federal watermaster garry stone said nearly three times that 
amount would be needed to meet the water needs of both the homes 
hotelcasinos and businesses around reno and the irrigation demands 
of golf courses and farmers and ranchers 
this years agricultural losses are estimated at 10 million to 
15 million by university of nevadareno economists 
joe ely chairman of the pyramid lake paiute indians said his 
tribes ancestral lake has fallen more than two feet this year the 
lake downstream from reno retained enough water for a successful 
summer of boating and fishing but the flow from the truckee river 
was too low to allow the endangered cuiui fish and the threatened 
lahontan trout to spawn ely said 
sixty miles east of reno irrigation of alfalfa and cantaloupe 
fields near fallon has left lake lahontan with about 12600 acre 
feet of water in its 314000acrefoot basin 
lahontan irrigation water was cut off in midseptember but one 
more small release is planned late this month for winter crops 
leaving less than 10000 acrefeet in reserve for next year 
of the other reservoirs that serve western nevada and the 
sierra the only usable supplies are at donner lake and at boca 
reservoir also in california where westpac utilities is saving 
11500 acrefeet of water 28 percent of its capacity 
there isnt a lot of storage left as reservoirs go said 
chris pacheco water supply specialist with the state office of the 
us soil conservation service

husband black nationalist nelson mandela at his guarded hospital 
room saturday and said he was angered by president pw bothas 
claim that he is cooperating with the government 
she also said speculation about his imminent release were 
sheer rumors 
botha suggested last week that the jailed african national 
congress leader could be freed soon if he continues cooperating 
with the authorities as he is doing at present botha did not 
elaborate 
about the socalled cooperation with the government mandela 
says he will answer to that himself mrs mandela told reporters 
as he said that he looked very angry 
mandela 70 is recuperating from tuberculosis at the 
constantiaberg clinic a modern private hospital in cape town he 
became ill in august and doctors expect him to make a complete 
recovery in about three months 
mrs mandela said she and her husband did not discuss the latest 
wave of speculation that he may soon be freed after 26 years in 
prison 
all the rumors about his release are sheer rumors she said 
in addition to his wife mandela was visited for more than an 
hour by his daughter zindzi and her two children and by his 
sister leaby piliso it was the mandelas first reunion since 
august 
mrs mandela said her husband looks very well much better 
than when i last saw him 
botha although refusing to be specific has said in recent 
weeks that he hopes mandela will not have to return to pollsmoor 
prison from the hospital government officials have indicated 
mandela might be freed without having to comply with bothas 
longstanding demand that he renounce violence 
mandela has been jailed since 1962 he received a life sentence 
in 1964 for plotting an anc sabotage campaign aimed at toppling the 
whiteminority government 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire said after meeting with 
botha on oct 1 that the south african president had promised to 
release mandela unconditionally 
botha refused to confirm this but a progovernment newspaper 
the citizen later quoted officials as saying mandela could be 
released at any time starting in midnovember 
mandela is the most popular leader among south africas 
disenfranchised black majority government officials worry that his 
release could provoke a new outbreak of black militancy and unrest 
but they also perceive that freeing mandela could ease 
international pressure on south africa

kathlehong a black township near johannesburg caused damage but 
no injuries police have blamed the anc for most of the roughly 80 
bombings in south africa this year

more than 200000 serbs rallied 
saturday in four towns to push demands for serbian control over two 
neighboring autonomous provinces 
the communist party leader of the northern republic of slovenia 
said meanwhile that the country is on the threshold of imposing 
emergency measures after violent demonstrations 
we have to sober up and stop this insanity said leader 
milan kucan 
his speech at an official rally in slovenia came during intense 
politicking before a meeting of the national communist partys 
central committee the meeting starting monday is expected to 
shake up yugoslavias leadership during its worst crisis since 
world war ii 
hundreds of thousands of serbs demonstrated in sombor in 
autonomous vojvodina province near the hungarian border and in 
leskovac 90 miles south of belgrade in the republic of serbia two 
smaller demonstrations occurred in indija in serbia and in stara 
pazova in vojvodina 
no violence was reported but all of the protesters pledged 
allegiance to slobodan milosevic the serbian party chief in what 
has now become a daily phenomenon 
milosevic wants serbia one of yugoslavias six republics to be 
given more control over vojvodina and another autonomous province 
kosovo 
kosovo which was once inhabited mostly by serbs is now 
predominantly ethnic albanian serbs accuse kosovos leadership of 
discriminating against kosovos serbian residents 
milosevics push has alarmed nonserb leaders and has prompted 
outcries that his policies may tear yugoslavia apart 
in addition students and workers have used the ethnic rallies 
to push for economic and political changes prompting communist 
authorities in the southern republic of montenegro last weekend to 
use force to disperse demonstrators 
this month a crowd of 30000 in the disputed province of 
vojvodina laid siege to communist party headquarters forcing the 
resignation of the provinces entire leadership an unprecedented 
step in communist yugoslavia 
kucan the slovene leader criticized the demonstrations and 
indirectly accused the leadership of serbia of conducting policies 
that jeopardize the stability of the country 
he said a continuation of the unrest could lead to the 
introduction of emergency measures nationwide the state news 
agency tanjug reported 
last week authorities in montenegro banned street rallies there 
after proserbian demonstrations escalated into antigovernment 
protests 
we were on the threshold of emergency measures after the 
recent events in novi sad and titograd kucan said referring to 
the vojvodina and montenegro capitals where the disturbances took 
place 
it is no problem to get people on to the streets fire up 
their passions but one should think of the consequences which are 
hard to forget he said 
he called for more democratic changes and freedoms as a solution 
to yugoslavias political crisis and economic woes 
inflation reached 217 percent in september and the foreign debt 
stands at 21 billion austerity measures imposed last may to 
ensure new loans have slashed wages while allowing prices to rise 
on friday the government announced plans to ease the unpopular 
austerity program newspapers reported 
changes in the program include wage increases for workers in 
profitable companies and more funding for hardpressed social 
services such as health and education the changes were announced 
thursday by the federal government belgrades staterun dailies 
said 
but all seemed subject to approval by the international monetary 
fund whose delegation has announced a visit to yugoslavia next week 
kucan said it was understandable that yugoslavs were unhappy 
with a drastic increase of prices and a drop in the 
purchasing power it is not hard to bring so many unhappy people on 
to the streets kucan said 
mondays meeting is supposed to approve sweeping personnel 
changes and unite the bickering communist party leadership on 
policies to overcome the social and economic crisis 
premeeting maneuvering has opened up public rifts between the 
serbian communist leadership and other communist leaders around the 
country 
on friday serbian communist organizations demanded the 
resignation of national party chief stipe suvar for accusing the 
serbian party of not doing enough to defend the legacy of the late 
josip broz tito who died in may 1980 after ruling supreme for 35 
years 
tito worked to unite the countrys fractious ethnic groups 
serbian communist organization are being accused of moving to 
splinter the country

relief workers trying to stop famine 
deaths in the southwest spoke saturday of feeding refugees so 
wretched they cant afford clothing and live in huts fashioned from 
sticks and scrub undergrowth 
death from starvation is an everyday occurrence in the refugee 
camps although the toll has tapered off to 10 daily from 80 a day 
in july and august the worst months in a summer that some relief 
officials say took up to 10000 lives 
the tiny town of abyei 500 miles southwest of khartoum has 
become a gathering place for people dispossessed in a bitter civil 
war that is largely ignored by the world 
just beyond the reach of the fighting it also became the target 
of a usfinanced supply mission aiming to airlift 90 tons of food 
in a 10day period that began thursday 
the people in abyei are totally emaciated said cole dodge 
khartoum representative of unicef the un childrens fund 
there are old people women and children a few wearing 
ragged short and wide shifts while the rest are naked they live 
in african grassandstick huts huddled together he said 
dodge said 820000 people have fled the war into camps or other 
havens in sudan or neighboring ethiopia of those 65000 are 
receiving relief in the western regions of darfur and southern 
kordofan where abyei is located 
twinengine cessna planes fly three flights daily from the arid 
town because local aircharter companies have no larger cargo 
planes available and abyeis tiny airfield can hardly handle them 
abyei has no more than a dozen or 15 permanent structures 
including the military headquarters the jail the relief center 
and the school said dodge who returned to the capital friday 
from abyei 
neither the americans nor others in the project have disclosed 
the cost of the supply mission but dodge said unicef will pump 
500000 worth of goods into abyei in the next six months 
the sudanese red crescent says abyeis population normally is 
10000 but the refugees had swelled it to 40000 dodge estimated 
15000 to 20000 live there now 
unicef said food is so short on abyeis open market that the 
price of a 198pound bag of sorghum the sudanese staple has risen 
from 16 to 166 in two months the refugees most of whom 
abandoned all their belongings to find safety cannot buy any 
officials of western relief organizations speaking on condition 
of anonymity estimated 10000 people perished from starvation and 
the lack of medical care during the summer and continue killing 
about 10 people a day in the abyei area 
officials estimate that twice that number in the region and 
further south receive no help because weather and road conditions 
activity of the rebel sudan peoples liberation army or fighting 
between the rebels and the government make it impossible to reach 
them 
the liberation army fighting for economic and political reforms 
since 1983 claims to control 90 percent of the southern 
countryside a key demand is autonomy for the christian and animist 
african south from the moslemdominated government in the north 
the government earlier expelled several western relief agencies 
for allegedly working with the rebels in order to get supplies to

rawlins on the other hand says his studies of pearys notes 
kept at the national archives and johns hopkins university convince 
him that the admiral knew exactly how far away he was and turned 
back when supplies ran low and warming weather threatened to make 
the floating ice too dangerous 
rawlins concluded that peary was as much as 121 miles away from 
the pole when he turned back 
rawlins evidence comes from interpretation of pearys 
longsuppressed notes which rawlins recently uncovered at the 
archives where pearys papers were kept under seal for about 50 
years 
rawlins was first made aware of the mysterious document a 
series of astronomical observations when he learned that isaiah 
bowmans file of his dealings with peary also had been unsealed 
after half a century 
bowman a former president of johns hopkins was a defender of 
peary and had come into possession of a copy of pearys secret 
document in 1935 pearys daughter marie had sent to bowman a 
copy of the mysterious paper which was kept in her mothers safe 
deposit box in portland maine 
according to bowman peary had instructed his wife jo to 
treasure the piece of paper as her most precious possession and 
never let it out of her hands unless it was to silence critics 
peary died in 1920 
after he saw bowmans copy and other notes rawlins located the 
original peary document at the national archives and deciphered it 
pearys grandson stafford disputes rawlins calculations 
i have a study done by two mathemeticians of the coast and 
geodetic survey in 1911 they took the observations he made at 
pole and came up with the conclusion he was within 16 miles 
said stafford 
and he added a gentleman named heber curtis in the 1939 
edition of naval institute proceedings analyzed the admirals 
observations at the pole and found it made within 100 feet 
all i can say is all his observations have been studied to 
death the naval affairs committee of the house of representatives 
studied it in minute detail and both the minority and majority 
decision said yes he had been there stafford said 
there are various ways of calculation that have been made that 
have cast doubt on his effort but their validity is 
conjectural said the smithsonians lundeberg when we are 
trying to establish the arrival of an explorer at an ice floe at a 
geographic location theres nothing that can be left there 
permanently as a record 
capt robert bartlett was the last man to turn back before the 
final rush to the pole stafford said but before leaving he 
checked his location and calculated that he was 133 miles from the 
pole after that peary went on for five more days stafford said 
could he still have been 121 miles away from his goal stafford 
asked 
that was a time when explorers depended on the sun and stars for 
navigation and on their wits and guts for survival he said if you 
got into a problem you didnt pick up a mike and call houston for 
help

president reagan in one of his most partisan 
radio addresses in months today accused the democratic majority in 
congress of being budget profligates who seek to elect a 
taxandspend president 
and reagan took credit for the fact that the deficit for the 
fiscal 1989 federal budget is projected to be below 146 billion 
if the deficit exceeded that figure the grammrudman balanced 
budget act requires automatic acrosstheboard cuts 
left to its own devices congress would not have done this 
reagan said 
the office of management and budget informed congress on friday 
that its final projection of the fiscal 1989 federal deficit was 
just under the 146 billion grammrudman target if the projection 
had exceeded that figure defense and domestic spending would have 
been cut by at least 10 billion 
instead of praising the bipartisan agreement that paved the way 
for the accord reagan offered a backhanded slap at the outgoing 
democraticrun congress and democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis 
im sorry to say that the congress liberal leadership has one 
answer to everything and thats raise your taxes and if they 
stay in control of the congress they may just find a way to raise 
them reagan warned 
without mentioning either presidential candidate by name reagan 
touted vice president george bushs antitax stand 
why should we have a president who says no more taxes and 
congress have a liberal leadership that wants to tax and spend 
if we dont want a taxandspend liberal in the white house 
shouldnt we give the president a congress that will work with 
him reagan said 
he did note that congress had passed all its spending bills on 
time this year instead of bundling them into a huge emergency 
piece of legislation 
congress heard my warning that if that happened again id use 
my veto pen reagan said so we stopped congress from 
saying once more the dog ate my homework when its budget 
assignment was due 
in the democratic response rep dennis eckart dohio sharply 
attacked bush the gop presidential nominee 
george bush has been a silent partner riddled with 
corruption corruption that has reached into the presidents 
cabinet to the pentagon from defense contractors to wall street 
and yet it was a democratic congress this week that spoke of the 
shared vision with the american people and mike dukakis in passing 
a tough ethics bill that covered ourselves and those who tried to 
profit from their connections eckart said 
even a cut of 10 billion would make only a small dent in the 
overall 11 trillion federal deficit leaders of both parties have 
sought to avoid triggering the mandatory cuts of the grammrudman 
bill which could offend many interest groups 
lots of people were disposed to avoid that said sen lawton 
chiles dfla chairman of the senate budget committee 
ombs final projection for the 1989 fiscal year deficit is just 
under 1455 billion the fiscal year began oct 1 
if there had been 545 million more in federal spending the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law would have required government 
expenditures to be cut by whatever amount would have reduced the 
deficit to 136 billion 
because of delays in completing antidrug legislation and other 
bills congress will continue working next week rather than 
adjourning for the year friday as planned 
that means that congress could pass additional spending bills 
for fiscal 1989 that would add to the deficit but under the 
grammrudman law spending enacted after oct 15 which is two 
weeks into the fiscal year is not calculated and there are no 
legal consequences to adding to the deficit after that date 
however there would be political consequences 
omb director james c miller iii who leaves office today 
wrote in his resignation letter that he was urging reagan to veto 
any spending measure that would push the deficit beyond 146 
billion even though it would no longer set off automatic cuts 
i urge you to maintain a commitment to deficit reduction 
during the final days of this congress miller told congressional 
leaders 
some lawmakers and aides have said congress might pass 
legislation next week or next year to pay for new programs 
created by the drug bill 
congressional leaders and administration officials worked 
closely all year in an effort to ensure a tranquil budget process 
that sidestepped the oftrepeated crises of previous years 
last november following the stock market crash reagan and 
congressional leaders reached a budget pact that set spending 
limits for this year that agreement though not legally binding 
was largely adhered to and eased this years budget work immensely 
in an achievement unmatched since 1976 congress completed all 
13 appropriations bills needed to finance the government before 
fiscal 1989 began the last bill passed at 1157 pm on sept 30 
three minutes before the end of fiscal 1988 
the congressional budget office on tuesday projected the 1989 
deficit at 1518 billion well above the 146 billion deficit 
target 
but congress changed the grammrudman law last year making the 
cbo projection only advisory in years past such different 
projections by the congressional and administration budget agencies 
would have provoked bitter disputes that likely would have lasted 
for months

president ronald reagans weekly address 
last month i had an unusual phone call from texas sen lloyd 
bentsen he asked me to play dan quayle and help him prepare for 
the vicepresidential debate i eagerly accepted i thought it 
would be fun 
however as i began to study up on sen quayle i realized that 
i was studying a controversial man a man who did not share the 
lives the needs and the hopes of many of my constituents in 
northeastern ohio a man who took every shortcut available who 
never struggled to make ends meet to make college costs or to pay 
his rent 
i had to wonder what it was about dan quayle that george bush 
liked i realized there have been a lot of those folks in george 
bushs career robert bork rita lavelle james watt and ed 
meese and never once did george bush question their judgment or 
their ability to serve its no wonder he picked a guy like dan 
quayle 
were now 24 days from a watershed presidential election a 
decision that will take america into the 1990s and on thursday 
millions of americans sat in their living rooms and looked for the 
next leader of the free world because leadership is what the 
election is all about leaders that believe in the shared values 
of the american people and are willing to work with the congress 
not engage in needless confrontation the kinds of confrontation 
that has resulted in the democratic congress overturning a dozen 
presidential vetoes on issues like trade clean water civil 
rights and job creation 
thursday night was the candidacy of the status quo versus the 
candidacy of we can do better my congressional district in 
northeastern ohio holds to many traditional values hard work 
strong moral and religious beliefs pride in their heritage and 
the accomplishments of their children but they know that its been 
the democrats who have worked hard to save their jobs that it was 
george bush and dan quayle who opposed plantclosing and tough 
trade laws but that it was texas sen lloyd bentsen who led the 
fight to put america first

was the democratic congress sharing mike dukakiss belief that we 
have to end this indiscriminate dumping and pass legislation to end 
those who will pollute our beaches with medical waste and thus 
return the beaches to our children so they can enjoy them 
it was once again the democratic congress that passed sweeping 
welfare reform legislation called for by mike dukakis in his role 
as massachusetts governor we responded with an appropriate bill 
to help take people off of welfare and put them back on productive 
payrolls 
ive watched this campaign closely not only through my eyes 
but through the eyes of my eightandahalf year old son eddie 
whos asked me often dad whats this all about ive told him 
that its about leadership and shared values an america that looks 
to a new generation of leadership that is both dynamic and just 
leaders who have a sense of compassion but a commitment to 
individual initiative leaders who can inspire but are inspired by 
our history in a sense that our greatness really is in the future 
i told eddie its a challenge that lies before us it does not 
rest with those who are unwilling to risk something of themselves 
nor does it rest with those who demand that the struggle be easily 
won it does rest with those who are ready and willing to trade the 
comfort and the convenience of the critic for the sweat and the 
sacrifice of the committed and it rests with those of us who have 
a hope and a vision for a better america and a better world and 
among all of us who believe that the best of america is yet to

the vatican was in the red by nearly 64 
million last year its secondlargest deficit ever according to a 
financial statement issued saturday by the holy see 
church officials who released the document appealed to roman 
catholics to contribute more so that the vatican could adequately 
carry out its pastoral mission 
it was the ninth year in a row that the administrative center 
for the worlds 850 million catholics has operated at a loss 
the deficit will be covered by 50 million from peters 
pence the annual offering from catholics to the pope and the 
rest by reserve funds a news release said 
the vatican said its 1987 deficit was 746 billion italian lire 
down from a record 766 billion a year earlier using the 1987 
endofyear exchange rate the church said the 1987 figure equalled 
638 million 
the holy see said it expects its 1988 shortfall to be its 
largest ever climbing 3 percent above the 1987 figure even 
though it slapped strict controls on spending and has urged more 
contributions 
the news release said covering the 1988 deficit would be 
precarious because reserve funds had been used to pay 1987 
expenses 
the budget statement was issued by the 12member council of 
cardinals for the study of the organization and economic problems 
of the holy see at the conclusion of three days of meetings 
members of the council and the vatican spokesman were not in 
their offices or residences saturday to answer telephone calls 
the budget covers expenses for the curia or the churchs 
central administration vatican radio diplomatic missions and the 
vatican newspaper losservatore romano 
the largest 1987 expense was salaries for the vaticans 2325 
employees and pension payments to its 880 retirees which combined 
to make up 54 percent of the budget compared to 51 percent in 
1986 the financial statement said the increase was due to a 
reorganization of personnel and salary raises 
the budget does not include the vatican bank or the costs of 
pope john paul iis travels which the vatican says are paid for by 
local churches 
the vaticans biggest source of income came from investments 
such as bank accounts stocks and bonds and property which paid 
381 million an increase of nearly 7 percent from a year earlier 
according to the statement 
while peters pence is considered papal rather than vatican 
income the vatican news release noted contributions to the fund 
for the first nine months of this year had reached 368 million 
an increase of 29 percent over the same period in 1987 
the council includes two cardinals from the united states john 
oconnor of new york and retired archbishop john krol of 
philadelphia the united states and west germany are considered 
major sources for contributions 
the vatican began making its financial details public in 1979 at 
the urging of pope john paul ii at that time its deficit was 20 
million this year marked only the second time the church gave 
breakdowns for expenses and income 
according to the vatican statement the church spent 1327 
million in 1987 and took in 689 million for a deficit of 638 
million 
while the 1987 deficit is the secondlargest on vatican ledgers 
it actually works out to the largest ever in dollars because of 
swings in the exchange rate 
because the rate used in the vatican calculations was one of the 
lower ones for 1987 the extent of the deficit is magnified in 
dollars

with a little help from her mother 
2yearold jessica mcclure unveiled a bronze plaque saturday 
commemorating her rescue one year ago after 58 hours trapped in an 
abandoned well 
jessica squealed with delight and squirmed in her mothers arms 
while about 150 people crowded in to see the plaque which shows 
the smiling dusty faces of rescue workers when they pulled the 
bandaged child up a rescue shaft 
chip and i are still thanking the lord for getting us our 
beautiful baby back cissy mcclure said at the ceremony this 
rescue meant a lot to us 
mayor carroll thomas praised the spirit of the volunteer 
rescuers many of whom came from cities outside midland to help 
those people responded marvelously on the spur of the moment 
and they came as fast as they could thomas said 
the plaque designed by midland artist mary griffith reads 
nothing the heart gives away is gone it is kept in the hearts of 
others 
thomas announced the creation of an annual award to be given by 
midland to another us city which shows community spirit akin to 
that displayed in midland during jessicas ordeal the first such 
award will be given next year on the second anniversary of 
jessicas rescue 
jessica fell into the 8inchwide abandoned water well in her 
aunts back yard on oct 14 1987 and captured the worlds 
attention when she cried for her mother and softly sang nursery 
rhymes until her rescue in front of live television cameras 
volunteers drilled a shaft parallel to the well their progress 
made agonizingly slow because the hard rock dulled even 
diamondtipped drill bits after two days of drilling they made a 
horizontal shaft just under jessica and plucked her out oct 16 
midland firefighters and paramedics had joined with oil drilling 
engineers and roughnecks for the painstaking effort 
the plaque is intended to thank them and the oilfield service 
companies that provided equipment used by the volunteers jim and 
joy cook of corpus christi provided funds for the 4by6foot bas 
relief on the side of a community center in downtown midland 
during her ordeal jessica was wedged in the shaft in such a 
position that blood flow to her right foot was impaired and she 
lost a small patch of skin from her forehead 
jessica lost her right little toe and part of her big toe and 
skin had to be stretched over the forehead wound but after 
spending more than a month in the hospital her doctors say she 
apparently hasnt suffered any other adverse physical or 
psychological effects 
in an interview published in sundays editions of the odessa 
american jessicas 19yearold parents said their daughter is 
normal with no memory of the tumble that made world headlines 
i dont think she realizes shes any different mrs mcclure 
said she knows shes jessica and shes the little girl that fell 
in the well but that doesnt mean anything to her 
after a squabble over rights to the story between two factions 
of people who were involved in the rescue a los angeles production 
company is drafting a script for a television movie about jessicas 
saga 
the toddler has a trust fund at a local bank that will be used 
for future medical bills and will be turned over to her when she 
becomes 26 
in december 1987 the midland city council passed an ordinance 
requiring that abandoned wells be covered

president reagan attacked democrat michael 
duakakis on saturday as a taxandspend presidential candidate 
who if elected would cater to the liberal big spenders on 
capitol hill 
turning his weekly radio address into a promotion for vice 
president george bush reagan echoed the gop presidential 
candidates jabs at dukakis as a freespending softondefense 
liberal out of step with the american mainstream 
in the democratic response rep dennis eckart dohio also was 
sharply partisan attacking bush 
without referring to either candidate by name reagan repeated 
the word liberal 14 times in his fiveminute address 
im sorry to say that the congress liberal leadership has one 
answer to everything and thats raise your taxes and if they 
stay in control of the congress they may just find a way to raise 
them reagan said 
reagan noting that in less than four weeks voters will choose a 
new president posed several questions 
why should we have a president who says no more taxes and 
congress have a liberal leadership that wants to tax and spend 
reagan asked clearly referring to bushs nonewtax pledges 
if we dont want a taxandspend liberal in the white house 
shouldnt we give the president a congress that will work with 
him reagan queried 
eckart said people in his district holds to many traditional 
values hard work strong moral and religious beliefs pride in 
their heritage and the accomplishments of their children 
but they know that its been the democrats who have worked 
hard to save their jobs that it was george bush and dan quayle who 
opposed plantclosing and tough trade laws but that it was texas 
sen lloyd bentsen who led the fight to put america first 
eckard also charged that george bush has been a silent 
partner riddled with corruption corruption that has reached into 
the presidents cabinet to the pentagon from defense contractors 
to wall street 
in his address reagan also claimed credit for the fact the 
deficit for the fiscal 1989 budget is projected to be below 146 
billion 
if the deficit exceeded that figure the grammrudman balanced 
budget act required automatic acrosstheboard cuts 
left to its own devices congress would not have done this 
reagan said you see congress is still controlled by liberal big 
spenders

instead of praising the bipartisan agreement that paved the way 
for the accord reagan took a slap at the democraticrun congress 
saying many of its liberal leaders are congratulating themselves 
about the handling of the budget 
reagan did acknowledge that congress had passed all its spending 
bills on time this year instead of bundling them into a huge 
emergency piece of legislation 
but capitol hill couldnt have done it without him he asserted 
congress heard my warning that if that happened again id use 
my veto pen reagan said so we stopped congress from saying 
once more the dog ate my homework when its budget assignment was 
due 
the possibility of even a 10 billion cut which would make 
only a small dent in the overall 11 trillion federal deficit 
forced leaders of both parties to avoid triggering the mandatory

here is the text of president reagans weekly 
radio address 
my fellow americans today we learned that there will be no 
grammrudmanhollings sequester this year with that in mind id 
like to take a moment to talk about one of washingtons favorite 
pastimes making the federal budget 
as congress prepares to leave town many of its liberal leaders 
are congratulating themselves about their handling of the budget 
and yes at least congress didnt repeat its budget performance of 
last year one desperation bill called a continuing resolution 
passed over two months late rather than the 13 regular 
appropriations bill required by law 
congress heard my warning that if that happened again id use my 
veto pen even if it meant shutting down the entire government so 
we stopped congress from once more saying the dog ate my 
homework when its budget assignment was due and we got them to 
cut spending enough so that well meet the grammrudmanhollings 
targets this year 
but left to its own devices congress would not have done this 
you see congress is still controlled by liberal bigspenders and 
no matter when they hand in their homework they still call every 
paper tax and spend 
you may have heard a lot of campaign talk from our liberal 
friends recently about the federal deficit and federal debt what 
you dont hear them say is that the president cant spend one dime 
of the governments money without congressional appropriations 
only congress can decide how much the government spends only 
congress can pass spending bills only congress can determine how 
big the deficit will be or if were to have deficit at all 
in fact it is against the law for the president to spend a 
penny more or a penny less than congress directs him to spend the 
president cant add to the deficit he cant subtract from it 
either thats congress job and how many of us have stopped to 
think that our liberal friends have had a majority in the house of 
representatives for 52 of the last 56 years and in both houses of 
congress for 46 of those 56 years and in all that time there were 
only eight scattered years in which the budget was balanced the 
last time was 1969 
over the years ive asked congress for many spending cuts that 
congress with its liberal leadership has rejected add them all up 
and they come to more than this years entire budget deficit think 
of it we could have wiped out a year of deficits if our liberal 
friends in congress were as dedicated to reducing government 
spending as we are 
of course the liberal bigspenders in congress will tell you 
that theyre for reducing the deficit and even for reducing 
spending but somehow for them reduced spending always comes down 
to reduced defense spending and time and again when they cut 
defense spending its just been a cover for spending more on their 
special interest programs 
in six years the liberal leadership in congress cut defense 
spending authority by over 125 billion and for every dollar they 
cut from defense outlays they added 2 to domestic spending ive 
called on our liberal friends in congress to admit their addiction 
to big spending and to give the president more tools to help them 
kick the habit 
and thats why ive wanted a balanced budget amendment to 
require them to live within their means and its why ive wanted a 
line item veto for the president so the president can go through 
the budget lift out bad spending item by item and make congress 
vote on it out in the open not hidden with thousands of other 
items 
that way if the spending really is bad youll know about it 
and your representatives will have to answer to you when they go 
home and ask for your vote 
you can see why the liberal congressional leadership is dead set 
against the balanced budget amendment and the line item veto they 
like things just as they are although they act as if the first 
chance they get theyll find a way out of the discipline of 
grahamrudmanhollings im sorry to say that a congress liberal 
leadership still has one answer to everything raise your taxes 
and if they stay in control of the congress they just might find a 
way to raise them 
in the next four weeks as youre thinking over how you will 
vote this year i wish youd consider something else as well since 
we must ride two horses congress and the president across every 
stream shouldnt they both be going the same way why should we 
have a president who says no more taxes and congress have a 
liberal leadership that wants to tax and spend why should we have 
a president whos for a line item veto and a balanced budget 
amendment and congress have a liberal leadership thats against 
both 
if we dont want to taxandspend liberal in the white house 
shouldnt we give the president we do want a congress that will 
work with him and when it comes to giving the next president a 
more receptive congress i hope youll remember if your 
representative and senator arent part of the answer you can be 
sure theyre part of the problem 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

a gunman killed an american who had 
lived in honduras for 26 years police said saturday an anonymous 
caller said a leftwing political group was responsible 
leo mills 63 originally from woodward okla was shot in the 
head friday with a pistol by a man who was walking down the street 
behind him a police spokesman said 
a caller told radio stations that a previously unknown group 
the morazan front claimed responsibility for the killing the 
anonymous spokesman said the group was leftist and killed mills as 
a symbol of the social changes that should take place in honduras 
mills had married into a wealthy honduran family and he ran 
their businesses and large landholdings even after he and his wife 
separated 
he had served an 18month prison term in the 1981 killing of a 
community leader who led squatters in an occupation of some of his 
familys land 
friends of mills said his body would be sent to the united 
states to be buried in woodward 
police were investigating 
the morazan front apparently was named after francisco morazan

is known as the abraham lincoln of honduras

in a blow against dull and contrived 
reading material californias board of education has moved to 
reverse the dumbing down of student textbooks and recapture the 
magic of reading 
the 11member board on friday approved a list of 25 childrens 
books educators said will replace stultifying formuladictated 
texts with literature and classics of richness and diversity 
at the same time board member armen sarafian responding to 
criticism about lobbying by textbook publishers demanded an 
investigation by the state attorney generals office into the book 
selection process 
state superintendent of public instruction bill honig had said 
he thought some board members had become too cozy with the 
publishers accepting free rides and other things of value 
california with 11 percent of the nations annual 15 billion 
textbook expenditure has great clout with the publishers 
honig and the board agreed however that the new books will go 
a long way toward reviving the magic of reading for youngsters and 
exposing them to good writing 
the exercises in the books stress comprehension rather than 
singleword fillintheblank answers that do little to help kids 
understand what they have read honig said textbooks determine an 
estimated 90 percent of what teachers teach state education 
officials say 
current prescribed texts meet a socalled readability 
formula based on rote repetition numbers of syllables in a word 
and the wordcount in paragraphs a dustdry formula critics say 
robs children of the very elements that might motivate them to read 
as an example critics pointed to the dumbing down of 
little red riding hood by one textbook version apparently still 
in use the passage cited has little red repeating to exhaustion 
the fact that shes got a bunch of apples says red 
i can put red apples in my basket 
i can put red apples into my basket for grandma 
i have red apples 
i have big red apples 
i put the apples into my basket 
the public school officials were told there has been more 
concern with controlling vocabulary than telling the story with 
individual words repeated even when they are inappropriate to the 
story line 
kids have told me that stories about dick and jane or buffy 
and mack are boring said lisa izutsu a thirdgrade teacher at 
hamlin street school in canoga park those stories dont spark 
their imagination or their creativity but childrens literature 
really gets them motivated and interested in reading 
the official revolt against stupidity in education included 
board rejection of all spelling books that had been submitted for 
consideration 
the board declared that spelling should be taught along with 
reading and writing not as an isolated unconnected exercise 
members also decided to require future textbooks to come with a 
consumer warning label listing included literary works that had 
been abridged adapted or excerpted it was the third such decision 
in as many years aimed at nudging publishers to provide more 
thoughtprovoking fare for school children 
in earlier action the board rejected science texts lacking 
detailed explanations of evolution and math books that neglected 
the basics of problemsolving in favor of rote skills

a group of intellectuals who have 
denounced josip broz tito are demanding that the staterun media 
publish a document that blames the late yugoslav president for the 
countrys current crisis 
the 19member committee in defense of intellectual freedoms in 
a statement addressed to the yugoslav leadership last june 27 said 
tito was to blame for creating an undemocratic repressive 
political system which has thwarted the progressive development 
of the society 
the ruling communist party politburo on thursday sharply 
denounced the statement it said the document which calls for a 
critical reapprisal of titos role was the strongest attack 
yet on the founder of communist yugoslavia 
now the committee wants its statement to be published by the 
staterun press 
in a statement received by the associated press on saturday the 
committee said officials and the staterun press have branded them 
public enemies even though their document has yet to be 
published 
the committee said it wanted the document to be published so the 
public could evaluate its demands the statement was signed by 
prominent yugoslav university professors artists and scientists 
the statement dated oct 11 was addressed to the yugoslav 
communist leadership 
tito who died in may 1980 after ruling undisputed for 35 years 
is still officially revered in yugoslavia and public criticism of 
his policies can be prosecuted under yugoslav law 
titos role in making crucial political decisions and his 
absolute power in shaping yugoslav policies were so great that the 
presentday position of the country particularly its current deep 
social crisis cannot be understood or explained without a 
comprehensive and objective scientific and critical reappraisal of 
his historical responsibility the june statement said 
there can be no way out of the present economic political and 
moral crisis affecting yugoslav society without a thorough critical 
evaluation of past yugoslav policies it added 
the intellectuals also criticized titos nonaligned foreign 
policy for having isolated our country from its natural 
cultural historical economic and political surroundings in 
europe 
the forum denounced titos lavish lifestyle demanding to know 
the real costs of his rule 
the document triggered an open clash between national party 
chief stipe suvar and serbias ambitious communist party leader 
slobodan milosevic during the politburo meeting on thursday 
suvar from croatia accused serbian leaders of not doing enough 
to stop attacks by intellectuals on tito milosevic retorted 
angrily that serbia had been among the first to condemn the 
intellectual attacks 
although the june document was signed only by 19 prominent 
intellectuals many nonconformist intellectuals consider that 
yugoslavias current economic crisis labor and ethnic unrest have 
their roots in the tito years

rivals work for the democratic ticket and joking about a 
controversy that temporarily strained their relationship 
i didnt know anything about the celebration until today 
dukakis said in brief remarks after he arrived at the party just 
after midnight jesse was supposed to call me early this morning 
but he never made the call 
i never knew anything about it until i got off the plane from 
sacramento and the press told me about it dukakis continued 
dont you think hed give me a call first before everyone else 
the crowd of about 150 people clapped politely at the joke 
when dukakis selected lloyd bentsen as his running mate last 
summer he called other contenders for the no 2 spot to inform 
them of the choice but he was unable to reach jackson who was 
told of the selection by reporters at a washington airport aides 
described jackson as infuriated because he was not notified 
personally by dukakis and there was friction between the 
candidates until they reached an apparent truce at the democratic 
national convention 
dukakis appearance at the jackson celebration was one of only a 
few joint appearances they have had since the convention 
dukakis began his his remarks with a series of jokes and also 
presented jackson with a vcr and a campaign hat and jacket 
jesses given me a lot of advice dukakis said hes the 
guy who told me to tell bill clinton to make his speech a little 
longer i told him i was going to ride a tank in michigan and he 
told me those tanks are dangerous wear a helmet 
on a more serious note dukakis paid tribute to jacksons family 
and praised him for his voter registration efforts 
jackson then took the microphone and challenged his supporters 
to rally support for dukakis and bentsen 
the governor has set the pace he established the principles 
articulated the problems jackson said my friends governor 
dukakis can be trusted to keep hope alive to build the america of 
our dreams

the lack of child care in businesses costs the 
economy about 3 billion a year jeopardizing economic growth as 
more women are needed to enter the workforce the head of a 
national child care coalition said saturday 
declining birth and labor force growth rates mean that 
twothirds of new jobs will have to be filled by women between now 
and 1995 said barbara reisman executive director of the child 
care action committee in washington dc 
its fairly clear that the lack of child care is an impediment 
to entering the workforce said reisman in boston for a 
conference of the massachusetts association of day care agencies 
reismans organization late last month issued a report calling 
on the federal and state governments to play a greater role in 
working with businesses to increase child care efforts such as 
capital grants to employers for child care programs and parental 
leaves 
only 7 percent of american households now fit the beaver 
cleaver familys mold of breadwinning father and athome mother 
the report said as female labor force participation rates 
continue to climb the demand for child care will grow too 
the number of companies providing some form of child care has 
increased from 110 to 3500 in the past decade according to the 
study but that still accounts for just six in 10000 businesses 
the 3 billion figure cited by the report is based on child 
carerelated work absences reisman said it does not include 
estimates of lower productivity because of parents worries over a 
child lateness workforce departures or shorter work days 
if we continue to ignore the growing demand for child care we 
risk limiting the expansion of the labor force and jeopardizing 
economic growth the 90page report said 
we endanger millions of young children the future labor 
force for whom quality care during their first five years lays 
the foundation for lifetime learning it said children 
families employers and the nations economy all suffer from the 
lack of affordable quality child care 
the report was based on research commissioned from nine 
economists and policy analysts and the results of a national child 
care conference sponsored by the child care action campaign in 
march

officially les aspin the chairman of 
the house armed services committee flew into town on an air force 
plane to visit a nearby army vehicle plant 
the real reason aspin confided is that notre dame is 
playing miami 
the game saturday between the topranked hurricanes and no 4 
notre dame captured the interest of football fans nationwide and 
the wisconsin democrat was one of them 
aspin flew in friday from california where he briefed michael 
dukakis prior to thursdays presidential debate he was entitled to 
use the air force transportation because he toured the am general 
corp plant in mishawaka where the hummer multipurpose military 
vehicle is manufactured 
aspin said he saw nothing wrong with flying here at taxpayer 
expense because it was official business however he admitted 
flatly the timing of the visit was dictated by the football game 
he said he would pay for his own transportation leaving south 
bend 
aspin also said he was the very powerful congressman 
denounced by george bush in the debate for alleged defense waste in 
pushing through an appropriation for a truck contract the army 
didnt want 
im the guy george bush was talking about aspin said 
once again george has got it screwed up 
while he was instrumental in increasing appropriations for the 
hemat trucks which are built in wisconsin but not in aspins 
district the decision involved closing out the contract he 
said 
appropriations for the trucks were increased to buy 4700 
instead of 900 and close out production but rather than the army 
not wanting those trucks he said the army now wants 360 more

a fireman and a former firefighter have 
been arrested but townspeople are certain the book is not closed on 
the arson fires that have terrified the community since may 
i dont think anyone believes its over everybody seems to be 
looking for another person or two robert bruce owner of the old 
corner store said saturday 
thats making the assumption that the two arrested are even 
involved which is hard for us to accept he said 
theres still a lot of hot tempers said william perkins 
whose home was burned in may i dont know if the whole mystery 
has been solved or not 
on wednesday lance lalumiere 23 a former member of the 
volunteer fire department in this northern new hampshire community 
of 850 was arrested and charged with burning his brothers log 
cabin in august 
one day later lawrence coulter jr 19 also a volunteer 
firefighter was charged with setting fire to a vacation home in 
nearby dalton on oct 3 
during a news conference in concord authorities said they would 
seek indictments against lalumiere for 15 other fires and said 
they had suspects in five other arsons they declined to elaborate 
state police lt gary sloper would not say if authorities 
believe the two collaborated saying only they were investigating 
that possibility sloper has indicated there may be more arrests 
on friday at a hearing on a prosecution request to revoke 
lalumieres 50000 bail prosecutors filed documents saying 
lalumiere had admitted committing 16 other acts of arson in the 
jefferson area 
prosecutors also sought to revoke coulters 50000 cash bail 
during his arraignment thursday a state police officer said 
coulter is considered a suspect in the jefferson fires as well he 
did not elaborate 
the bail hearings continue monday and tuesday both men remained 
in jail neither has entered a plea 
the fires began in fields and brush and escalated to buildings 
no one was killed or seriously hurt but more than a dozen people 
were left homeless by the 21 fires in jefferson two in lancaster 
and one in dalton 
many people stayed up nights to guard their property with guns 
ready 
residents described lalumiere a dishwasher at a local 
restaurant as a hard worker who left the fire department after 
moving out of town for a time he was under 24hour surveillance 
several weeks before his arrest and had been questioned several 
times by police 
coulters arrest was more shocking because of the deep roots his 
wellrespected family has in the town 
his father was a firefighter and his mother helped organize a 
sept 16 fundraiser that brought in about 10000 for the fire 
department 
there was no reason to ever question his integrity said 
bruce who employed coulter parttime the past two years at the old 
corner store he was an excellent employee 
i still think the general feeling in town is theres more 
involved in this if in fact these two are involved i dont 
think anyone is ready to accept the fact they are alone he said

five nuns locked in a spiritual 
battle over the intrusion of the modern world into their cloistered 
lives approached the end of their second week barricaded in their 
monasterys infirmary 
their diocesan leader bishop frank rodimer is calling the 
increasingly tense standoff within the roman catholic church a 
scandal and says it stems mainly from personaly differences the 
dispute has even involved the vatican 1979 nobel prize winner 
mother teresa of calcutta and indirectly walt disney and julie 
andrews 
the carmelite nuns at the monastery of the most blessed virgin 
mary of mount carmel are cloistered ordinarily having no contact 
with the outside world 
but the five rebels have a spokeswoman 28yearold sister john 
of the cross who has handled the media with a touch of savvy while 
explaining that the five are fighting the introduction of modern 
conveniences into the monastery 
four of the nuns locked themselves in the infirmary oct 4 
because they feared they would be thrown out of the monastery a 
fifth joined them shortly afterward they say they are trying to 
remain in the monastery despite a notice of dismissal they received 
in june from their relatively new prioress mother teresa hewitt 
rodimer said the case stems from a personality conflict between 
the nuns ranging in age from 28 to 71 and their new prioress who 
replaced a woman the five became emotionally attached to 
i believe the bishop is simply clouding the issue when he 
brings up personality conflicts sister john told the associated 
press in an interview last week hes trying to make it something 
it is not 
sister john says the dismissal notice was issued after she and 
the other four protesters objected to the liberalization of the 
monastery with the introduction of newspapers sweets and 
television along with videotapes of the the sound of music 
the 1960s hit musical in which andrews played a woman who left a 
convent and the disney classic babes in toyland 
an appeal of the pending dismissal has been filed with the 
vatican and the nuns intend to stay in the infirmary until they 
hear from rome sister john said 
the protesting nuns met saturday with the rev kevin culligan of 
milwaukee who was sent by the vatican to help resolve the dispute 
sister john declined to discuss the visit she said more details 
would be available sunday and she did not think the nuns would 
leave their refuge over the weekend 
telephones at the dioceses offices went unanswered saturday and 
neither culligan nor diocesan officials could be reached for 
comment 
sister john argues that their struggle has been misunderstood by 
the media which she says have simplified the conflict down to five 
nuns who dont want television and sweets in their monastery vs a 
bishop prioress and eight other nuns who do 
the candy and television in themselves are not the issue 
sister john says we are to live a life of penance of austerity 
we are not to be distracted by anything the candy represents a 
lack of mortification 
rodimer disagrees saying the five are rebelling against the new 
prioress in a news conference wednesday rodimer referred with a 
touch of sarcasm to the television and sweets as very profound 
issues 
no comment from the prioress was available saturday the 
telephone at the monastery was busy but mother hewitt told the 
starledger of newark earlier that the schism was between nuns who 
were loyal to the former prioress and those who accept the new 
authority not between conservative and liberal sisters 
she also said the changes introduced in the monastery were 
allowed under vatican iis reforms television magazines and 
newspapers had been available for several years she said but she 
agreed that she had broadened their use to balance what i thought 
had been too small a recognition of human needs 
rodimer warned the nuns they could be relieved of their vows 
theyve broken the vow of obedience and i suppose its a 
scandal in that sense he said 
the sister says she doesnt want to cause trouble within the 
church she says she realizes that some people think its 
hypocritical of the nuns to be espousing their conservative beliefs 
to television reporters 
what happened to us we hadnt planned she said we cant 
wait until its all over with the protest does appear as a 
contradiction we dont like it but its the only way we can 
obtain help at this moment 
supporters in the town have been donating fruit baskets to the 
nuns and mother teresa of calcutta has agreed to talk with pope 
john paul ii about the dispute this week sister john says 
sister john says she will continue fighting for the values for 
which she has sacrificed her secular life 
i love rock n roll and i love the yankees im a normal 
person she says but ive sacrificed those things to obtain 
something better i know god has called me here to morris township 
i was not called to any other monastery on earth

the soviet union has intensified its spying 
against the united states despite warmer superpower ties under 
kremlin leader mikhail gorbachev the no 2 man at the cia said 
saturday 
since gorbachevs ascension to power the hostile intelligence 
threat against us has grown said robert m gates the cias 
deputy director the number of operations against us has 
certainly increased 
gates also gave a gloomy assessment of international affairs 
predicting that in the next five to 10 years some nations may 
suffer economic collapse because of the aids epidemic and that drug 
kingpins could be elected to govern a major country 
in a speech and questionandanswer session at a convention of 
the association of former intelligence officers gates said 
chemical weapons the poor mans atomic bomb could be the 
most immediate threat to world peace and to the security of the 
united states and its allies he predicted a rapid spread of 
chemical weapons among developing countries now that the 
iraniraq war has broken the moral barriers against their use 
remarks by house speaker jim wright dtexas that the cia had 
tried to provoke nicaraguas sandinista regime into repressive 
tactics are not going to have any effect on our relations with 
the oversight committees 
speaking of moscow gates said that despite improved 
ussoviet relations we have seen an increase this year of soviet 
attempts to recruit us sources 
the choice of vladimir kryuchkov as chairman of the kgb likely 
will mean an intensification of soviet intelligence efforts against 
the united states and it allies he said 
kryuchkov believed to be a career specialist in foreign 
intelligence gathering replaced viktor chebrikov this month as 
chairman of the committee for state security which is known by its 
russian acronym kgb that agency conducts overseas espionage and 
acts as a domestic security service 
in a speech to another group on friday gates said that 
gorbachevs efforts to transform the soviet economy have not 
succeeded so far 
after three years of reform restructuring and turmoil there 
has been little if any slowing in the downward spiral of the 
soviet economy he said 
gates said saturday that federal agencies must develop 
realistic criteria to gauge whether political and economic 
change in the soviet union is genuinely reshaping the foundations 
of the system or whether the countrys totalitarian structure 
endures 
turning to other developments around the world gates told the 
former intelligence officers that at least 15 developing countries 
will be able to build ballistic missiles by the year 2000 and that 
20 countries were developing chemical weapons 
the 300billionayear international drug trade will get much 
worse before it gets better and no single country or group of 
countries can solve the problem 
in some countries drug gangs have bribed officials and editors 
and courted public opinion through charity he said 
it may be only a matter of time before we are faced with a 
freely elected legal narcogovernment in a major country he 
said he did not name any nations in which he thought that might 
happen 
asked what the emergence of a narcogovernment would mean 
for us foreign policy gates said i dont think anybody has 
thought very much about that we are trying to bring to the 
attention of policy makers things that are likely to happen in five 
to 10 years 
aids the acquired immunity deficiency syndrome differs from 
such past epidemics as the black death of the middle ages by 
striking not the old and weak but the young and active educated 
urban middle classes the very cadre that no developing country 
can afford to lose he said 
some economies or at least their industrial structures may 
collapse and some countries could become virtually ungovernable 
he said again he did not mention any countries by name but aids 
has taken a particularly heavy toll on nations in east and central 
africa 
only in the past year has the aids threat to the structure of 
national societies been highlighted in cia reports though the drug 
problem has been a concern somewhat longer gates said

democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd 
bentsen acknowledging polls showing the democrats behind spoke 
saturday of a democratic comeback this year like those that elected 
harry truman and john kennedy 
our party has a proud tradition of closing from behind and 
winning those elections he told about 500 people at an aflcio 
regional conference he said truman and john kennedy were also down 
in the polls but came back to win 
were going to do just like harry truman were going to tell 
the truth and the republicans are going to think its hell 
bentsen told a crowd earlier saturday at st louis soulard market 
in trumans home state of missouri 
i cant help but remember harry truman out there when the 
press had written him off the 67yearold texas senator said 
standing on a podium amid the vegetable displays in the openair 
market 
while polls showed truman losing to new york gov thomas dewey 
the democratic crowds kept getting bigger he said and i can 
still remember that chicago newspaper saying dewey had won said 
bentsen recalling the famous picture of truman holding up a 
newspaper front page 
in 1960 he said the weekend before the election john 
kennedy was eight points behind and went on to win because of 
the drive and the commitment and the enthusiasm of the american 
people 
on a day of campaigning before diverse crowds in missouri 
pennsylvania and new york bentsen repeated the themes that 
democrats hope will resonate with voters by election day including 
trade jobs education social security and a squeeze on the 
middle class 
bentsen told the food sellers in st louis that american 
agriculture exports had declined 40 percent since 1980 and that 
600000 goodpaying industrial jobs had been lost 
were tired of exporting jobs we want to export products and 
keep the jobs here not in taiwan or south korea he said 
in wilkesbarre at an auditorium filled with mostly elderly 
people he said the republicans had repeatedly tried to cut social 
security and medicare and that george bush could not be trusted 
i just really cant imagine someone at the age of social 
security or close to it who can vote for that other crowd he 
said 
in his speech at the new york labor rally bentsen said the 
economic expansion the republicans were touting was a hoax for 
many americans 
theyve created an economy where the rich get richer the poor 
get poorer and everyone in between gets squeezed he said 
it was the democrats who supported and the republicans who 
opposed raising the minimum wage and giving 60 days notice for 
laidoff workers he said 
bentsen was also scheduled in new york to meet with hispanic 
leaders and journalists and attend a fundraiser in brooklyn 
he was flying to washington saturday night but was to return to 
the campaign trail on monday with stops in texas and california 
when he talked at his stops about democratic campaign comebacks 
he also repeated the story of a democrat who didnt quite overcome 
his deficit 
i cant help but think back to what happened to hubert 
humphrey in 1968 he said 
on oct 10 hubert humphrey was 10 points behind on the polls 
came within seventenths of one percent of winning if he had made 
some of those speeches a little shorter and made a few more 
stops he mightve made it bentsen said

lukas knutsson climbed the railing 
saturday morning of the tallest bridge in the eastern united states 
as thousands of people gathered around a few seconds later he 
jumped 
knutsson from cambridge england was one of the more than 300 
parachutists from around the world who leaped from the new river 
gorge bridge during the ninth annual bridge day 
this is a totally unique sport knutsson said shortly after 
his first jump from the 876foot bridge its the closest a man 
can get to flying 
the second i was off it was beautiful the more i jump the 
more i can appreciate it im going to jump as many times as i 
can 
state police reroute the two northbound lanes of us 19 one day 
each year and let pedestrians crowd onto the highway to watch as 
brave souls leap and rappel from north americas secondhighest 
bridge about 40 miles southeast of charleston 
the national park service said 150000 showed up to watch 
saturdays show which was marred last year by a the death of a 
jumper 
steven gyrsting 25 of paoli pa died after an eightsecond 
free fall into rocks alongside the new river gorge national river 
few were deterred saturday and police reported no serious 
injuries about 600 jumps were made with most jumpers using bigger 
pilot chutes the parachutists aim for a small beach but some end 
up landing in the water 
gerard tobin of baltimore md was forced to wait for his jump 
on the bridges rail while a train passed below after his jump he 
said the fiveminute wait added to his nervousness 
damn straight it scares you said tobin who was attending 
his fourth bridge day death goes through your mind it scares 
you and makes you think about reality 
its risky added dave garen of winooski vt who had never 
jumped from a bridge before i dont like risk but i like 
challenges i wouldnt do it regularly but once or twice a year 
would be ok 
it scares me more than a plane jump in a plane you have 
2000 feet below you here you only have 876 feet you try to keep 
that out of your mind if you screw up you only have eight 
seconds 
members of base so named because its members leap from 
stationary objects like buildings antennas spans and earth forms 
look forward to bridge day because it is the only time they can 
make legal jumps from a bridge 
this is the only legal bridge jump in the world said jean 
boenish of hawthorne calif the thing that makes this 
challenging is because its the first base jump for many of the 
divers

gale force winds on saturday forced six 
greeks paddling a papyrus boat across the aegean sea to abandon 
their attempt to recreate a 10000yearold voyage 
it is impossible for a boat six meters 20 feet long to face 
such weather conditions at a time when larger ships were forced to 
return to safe harbors the hellenic institute of naval tradition 
said 
the canoelike boat made of yellow papyrus stems lashed 
together with rope set off eight days ago from lavrion a port 
near athens for the island of melos the 94mile trip was expected 
to take about nine days 
the boat was forced to abandon its attempt 25 miles from melos 
at the cycladic island of serifos the institutes announcement 
said 
the 5footwide papyrela greek for papyrus was launched in 
an effort to determine how stone age sailors could have reached the 
island to obtain obsidian a volcanic glass used to manufacture 
cutting tools 
obsidian found only on melos was discovered in a southern 
greek cave by us archeologists in 1972 the material which was 
dated to around 8000 bc was crafted into razorsharp blades and 
belonged to mesolithic cave dwellers 
the greek boat was built on the island of corfu using papyrus 
clumps found at a nearby lake it was patterned on a centuriesold 
local design 
papyrus boats were used in ancient egypt around 5000 bc in 
1969 a norwegian explorer thor heyerdahl tried to sail the rai 
a boat built from the reeds across the atlantic 
the rai sank eight weeks and 3000 miles into the journey a 
few hundred miles from the caribbean a later boat the raii 
successfully sailed from safi morocco to the bahamas in 1970 
the institute said saturday that it hoped to resume the voyage 
when weather conditions improved

a statesponsored deer hunt for 
children as young as 8 drew fire saturday from animal welfare 
groups and educators who claim its too traumatic to have kids kill 
the likes of bambi 
a florida game and fresh water fish commission spokesman 
defended the hunt in this rural military reservation as a way to 
educate youngters about gun safety and hunting etiquette 
forty children from 8to 15years old accompanied by adults 
were expected to take part in the weekend shotgun hunt in the wilds 
at the sprawling florida national guard reservation southwest of 
jacksonville 
three others are scheduled in the next two weeks the commission 
has sponsored similar hunts in the last three years but without 
much protest 
our worst fears were confirmed that little children were in 
a sense being indoctrinated to hunt said wayne pacelle director 
of the new yorkbased fund for animals which claims about 200000 
members and is opposed to all hunting we consider this 
statesponsored cruelty 
pacelle who visited the hunt area saturday morning said a 
10yearold and a 13yearold killed one deer each the first for 
each the hunt had a 40deer limit 
henry cabbage a commission spokesman said the agency was 
providing a public service by helping to teach safety 
these kids applied for these hunts theyre interested in 
hunting their parents are interested in teaching them cabbage 
said in tallahassee the fund for animals is on record that they 
are opposed to hunting it just gives them a handle to promote 
their ultimate objective of taking away the right to hunt 
having children kill animals for fun is ridiculous said 
sharon bailey of north miami who heads the florida chapter of the 
friends of animals a national antihunting group it twists the 
values of our children ive taken 8yearolds to see bambi even 
that upsets them she said of the animated disney movie 
earlier this week animalrights activist cleveland amory 
confronted gov bob martinez at a palm beach chamber of commerce 
breakfast and demanded he cancel the statesanctioned hunt amory 
is an author who helped found the fund for animals 
martinez ignored amorys comments and later said the hunt should 
go on he said it fosters closer relationships between parents and 
their children 
meanwhile about 75 protesters turned out and three were 
arrested as the air force academy opened its grounds in colorado 
springs colo to hunters saturday for the first legal deer hunt 
there in 18 years 
the rocky mountain humane society led the demonstration on the 
academy grounds and humane society executive director robin 
doxbury was one of the three arrested on criminal trespass charges 
all three later were released 
air force officials say the 1500 deer on the reservation are 
more than the area can feed and the hunt is intended to reduce the 
population by 80 does officials have cited more than 100 traffic 
accidents involving deer around the academy in the last year to 
argue that the growing deer population poses a danger to the public

economically and militarily dukakis told the texas rally 
the two go hand in hand he said you cant have one 
without the other and well have neither if we elect george bush 
and dan quayle to lead our country 
dukakis also pressed his effort to paint bush as a failed leader 
in the war on drugs who also let down the banking industry in his 
adopted home state of texas and offered no vision of the future 
george bush offers us the politics of complacency dukakis 
told the rowdy san antonio gathering lloyd bentsen and i offer 
the challenge of change george bush wants us to stick to the 
status quo 
dukakis said republican corruption and misguided decisions on 
defense spending had harmed the nations conventional strength and 
were costing jobs at military installations in texas 
thats why the republican era of greed and graft and 
corruption is going to end at high noon on the day i take the oath 
of office as president of the united states dukakis said 
earlier at the lawenforcement event the democrat spoke of 
murders in california by inmates on furlough during ronald reagans 
governorship and he said that while bush has been vice president 
there have been thousands of federal prison furloughs and one 
incident last year in which an inmate on furlough raped and 
murdered a mother of two in arizona 
polls indicate the republican vice president has been successful 
in attacking dukakis crime record by citing a massachusetts 
furlough program that granted a pass to a murderer who later raped 
a maryland woman 
the massachusetts governor said it was cynical and 
hypocritical for bush to use the massachusetts case for political 
gain 
dukakis said that he and reagan took responsibility for their 
programs but that bush has refused to take blame for his failures 
the governor also spoke of the mugging of his father at the age 
of 77 and the death of his brother in a hitandrun car incident 
i didnt learn my lessons about crime from a clint eastwood 
movie dukakis said ive been out there with you 
he said bush had failed in leading the reagan administrations 
drug war and he drew laughter from the audience when mentioning 
bushs proposal to put his running mate indiana sen dan quayle 
in charge of the drug fight 
the only thing i think that is cheaper today than it was in 
1982 is cocaine dukakis said blaming that in part on bush 
reagans point man on drugs 
he boasted of his states 14 percent decline in the rate of 
major crime and its rankings as the state with the lowest homicide 
rate among industrial states that progress he said resulted from 
his personal involvement in a statewide anticrime council 
this is an issue that is very close to me he said it 
comes right out of my gut 
dukakis also tailored part of his message to his california 
audience promising to double the number of federal drug agents and 
send the first 100 new agents to southern california 
when southern california and los angeles called for help 
where was the administration in washington nowhere to be found 
dukakis said its easy to talk about values its a lot tougher 
to live up to them thats really the issue in this campaign talk 
versus action an understanding of the future 
he also spoke saturday at a birthday tribute to jesse jackson 
his former democratic presidential rival 
jackson said the governor has set the pace he established 
the principles articulated the problems my friends governor 
dukakis can be trustedd to keep hope alive to build the america of 
our dreams 
at another rally dukakis touched on the environment another 
important issue in california promising an administration that 
supported clean air and clean water and clean oceans and clean 
government

failing when given the opportunity during thursday nights debate

down 
in appleton where escape artist harry houdini was born quayle

tried 
quayles campaign trips this week took him through michigan 
ohio indiana south dakota new mexico arkansas louisiana and 
wisconsin

that he was going to be my own handler and was taking more 
control of his campaign he said that as someone who has run 
successfully for elective office in the past i know whats best 
for george bush 
he was reacting to numerous reports that his words and actions 
are tightly controlled by bush campaign officials fearful of what

pope john paul ii told visiting american 
bishops saturday that roman catholic colleges and universities in 
the united states must be faithful to church doctrine 
john paul said the teachings of the church can truly be 
considered the expression of the infallibility of the church 
yet this does not prevent the church from recognizing and 
promoting a legitimate pluralism in theology 
but he said that pluralism is limited to the unity of the 
faith and the authentic teachings of the church 
the pope spoke of the importance catholic higher education has 
for the future of society and the church in the united states 
but added the degree of their influence depends entirely on the 
preservation of their catholic identity 
john paul also referred to what he called the damaging 
repercussions of the right to dissent on moral conduct 
it is not the conscience that establishes liberally what is 
right and what is wrong he said

a radical animal rights group claimed 
responsibility for defacing the homes and cars of three trainers 
involved in the disciplinary beating of a zoo elephant 
members of the animal liberation front poured red paint on the 
trainers cars let air out of their tires and splashed their homes 
with abrasive paintstripping chemicals either early friday or late 
thursday night said nancy burnet director of the coalition to 
protect animals in entertainment 
the dispute that has been broiling since february over the 
chaining and beating of the animal has included investigations by 
the local and national humane society the city attorneys office 
and the american association of zoological parks and aquariums 
burnet who said she does not belong to the animal liberation 
front but supports its action told the associated press she 
received a call from a group member friday claiming responsibility 
for the vandalism 
the trainers were all employees of the san diego zoological 
society said san diego zoo spokeswoman martha baker no one was 
injured in the episode she said 
we are outraged that the victims and their families have been 
terrorized in such a manner said doug myers executive director 
of the zoological society which operates the zoo and affiliated 
wild animal park personally attacking our employees is purely 
reprehensible 
in a statement released through burnet the group said its acts 
were in response to the trainers handling of dunda an 18yearold 
african elephant at the wild animal park near escondido in northern 
san diego county 
when dunda was transferred from the zoo to the wild animal park 
in february the trainers reported that she became unruly and at 
one point acted like she was trying to kill them 
to prevent the elephant from getting out of control the 
trainers said they had to chain the animal and beat her repeatedly 
with wooden sticks 
the zoological society defended the trainers actions saying 
they took the necessary steps to regain control of dunda others 
have criticized the form of discipline including several park 
employees who witnessed it 
the national humane society called the beating an isolated case 
of animal abuse but left any changes in the handling of elephants 
to the zoological societys discretion the local humane society 
and the city attorneys office cleared the zoo of abuse 
allegations 
in response to the situation the american association of 
zoological parks and aquariums created a task force to set 
nationwide elephant training standards considered later by its 
board of directors last month the group ruled the san diego 
trainers did not violate ethical standards

chrysler corp chairman lee a iacocca on 
saturday told his chinese partners they must improve quality in 
order to compete in the international auto market 
mostly we talked straight about quality iacocca said of his 
discussions with beijing jeep corp which is 31 percent owned by 
chrysler 
you must get quality up quality comes up productivity comes 
up costs go down and the world will recognize you as an exporter 
if you dont do that you cant play iacocca said 
he told a news conference that another key problem was getting 
enough foreign exchange to increase volume to the level where 
worldclass quality suppliers will invest in the company 
if there was one single thing we tried to emphasize this week 
it was we must prime the pump somewhat to get some volume going 
he said 
beijing jeep a joint venture begun in 1983 between american 
motors corp and the beijing automobile works shut down its 
assembly lines and almost collapsed in 1986 because it lacked 
foreign currency to buy needed parts 
the chinese government bailed out the enterprise which this 
year will produce about 4000 jeep cherokees and 25500 lightduty 
fourwheeldrive jeeps called the bj212 
chrysler took over amcs share of the business when it bought 
the company last year 
iacocca said production of the cherokee must be increased to 
10000 and then 15000 vehicles in the coming years to make the 
operation more viable 
he also emphasized quality a persistent problem in china in a 
speech before 300 chinese businessmen and officials in the great 
hall of the people 
the price of entry in the international automobile market is 
quality he said if you dont have the best product in its 
class dont try to compete 
he urged chinese automakers to develop their own market before 
exporting china last year produced 472000 vehicles almost all 
trucks and buses and has outlined ambitious plans for rapid 
expansion 
its passenger car industry just getting off the ground so far 
has been based entirely on joint ventures with chrysler producing 
in beijing volkswagen in shanghai and peugeot in canton 
iacocca who celebrated his 64th birthday saturday arrived 
monday for his first trip to china

this very unfortunate occurrence she added but no ones 
holding any grudge against anyone somebody made a mistake

a un official said saturday that if the 
united states withholds some of the dues president reagan promised 
to pay it would threaten an independence plan for southwest 
africa and other peacekeeping missions 
the united states paid 856 million friday reducing the 
american arrears to the regular budget to 3663 million 
un officials refused to confirm or deny a report published 
saturday by the new york times that said the united states would 
withhold 59 million of 188 million reagan pledged to pay by the 
end of the year 
the report said the funds would be frozen until the general 
assemblys main financial committee the fifth committee adopts an 
austerity budget recommended last month by a subcommittee 
un financial spokesman fred eckhard said saturday that if the 
us withheld dues it would be a disappointment and impinge on 
some un peacekeeping missions 
caroline dulin a spokeswoman for the us mission to the united 
nations said the administration had no reaction to the reports 
on sept 13 reagan announced he would release 188 million in 
unpaid american dues saying he was satisfied with the uns 
progress on budgetary and other reforms and approved the payment 
but ever since reagan took office eight years ago his 
administration has harshly criticized the united nations for what 
it calls antiwestern bias bureaucracy and waste and has withheld 
700 million in dues to the regular budget peacekeeping forces and 
un agencies 
eckhard pointed out that south africa cuba and angola have 
approved nov 1 as the date on which the united nations can begin 
implementing an independence plan for southwest africa also known 
as namibia 
the independence plan is estimated to cost 600 million to 700 
million for one year and eckhard said the united nations would 
need 100 million to 200 million up front to launch the plan 
funds the world body doesnt have 
the united nations has no reserve funds and operates by 
spending dues it collects almost as soon as it receives them 
eckhard said the united nations has so far only collected a 
fraction of the 357 million it assessed members for the first 
quarter of a peacekeeping mission in the persian gulf 
another peacekeeping operation that may require un funds is a 
proposal to send 2000 observers to the western sahara to monitor a 
referendum on independence for the region

jesus probably didnt write or use the lords 
prayer and may have uttered only a few of the phrases it contains 
a group of biblical and linguistic scholars has concluded at a 
conference 
the group was in general agreement however that jesus did use 
the word abba or father which was considered radical in 
his day it was the only part of the prayer nearly all of the 
scholars agreed that jesus certainly used theologians attatch 
great weight to the abba issue 
the group acknowledges the prospect of a fundamentalist uproar 
over their conclusions but say that doesnt bother them 
the prayer shows up in the gospels of luke and matthew which 
say jesus taught it to his disciples 
the 25 participants of the jesus seminar meeting in atlanta 
over the weekend agreed with a pennsylvania minister who 
researched the issue that jesus probably didnt ask god to 
deliver us from evil and almost certainly never said thy 
kingdom come thy will be done 
a paper presented friday by the rev hal taussig of st josephs 
university in philadelphia concludes that study of the gospels and 
early christian writings show the prayer is not in the words of 
jesus 
the participants voted to agree with taussig that jesus probably 
never said the prayer as a prayer and probably never taught it as 
one 
they concluded that parts of the prayer may have been said by 
jesus and that other parts represented his ideas 
taussig said he expects the conclusions to be accepted by 
biblical scholars but that it might be harder to convince most 
churches 
the jesus seminar is a 3yearold forum designed to raise public 
interest in efforts to separate what jesus actually said from words 
that may have been put in his mouth by early christians 
the participants from colleges and universities around the 
country generally characterize themselves as biblical scholars 
rather than theologians 
the seminar which convened here friday has drawn fire from 
the biblethumpers on the right said dr robert w funk a 
former theology professor at emory university and founder of the 
jesus seminar 
he said a main goal of the seminar is to allow qualified 
biblical scholars to relate their work to issues of public interest 
and to get it away from the frauds the tv evangelists who are 
mostly quacks 
the scholars have spent years studying the earliest available 
versions of the gospels in greek and coptic some know aramaic 
which scholars say jesus probably spoke 
by superimposing early language patterns on what is known of how 
people lived at the time of jesus and later during the early 
christian era the scholars believe they can make fairly sound 
decisions on what was said and what was attributed by others 
funk said the earliest fragment of the gospels dates from about 
125 ad and that there are frequent changes in subsequent 
versions since each was hand copied 
versions began to stabilize by around 400 ad he said there 
were no big surprises after that 
funk said the earliest greek and coptic versions of the gospels 
of matthew mark and luke are inconsistent with modern versions and 
the life and customs as they were known to be at the time of jesus 
for example the early christian church borrowed heavily from 
jewish practices and customs and attributed some of those to 
jesus funk said 
of course we havent drawn anything like the last temptation 
of christ he said referring to the controversial movie but he 
said he expected an angry reaction from segments of the 
fundamentalist community that believe in a literal interpretation 
of the new testament 
if they dont react to it he said the study may not get much 
attention 
the seminar also concluded that jesus created the tale of the 
good samaritan but decided that the parable of the fisherman who 
sorts good fish from bad was created later by someone else

a un official said saturday that if the 
united states withholds some of the dues president reagan promised 
to pay it would threaten an independence plan for southwest 
africa and other peacekeeping missions 
the united states paid 856 million friday reducing the 
american arrears to the regular budget to 3663 million 
un officials refused to confirm or deny a report published 
saturday by the new york times that said the united states would 
withhold 59 million of 188 million reagan pledged to pay by the 
end of the year 
the report said the funds would be frozen until the general 
assemblys main financial committee the fifth committee adopts an 
austerity budget recommended last month by a subcommittee 
un financial spokesman fred eckhard said saturday that if the 
us withheld dues it would be a disappointment and impinge on 
some un peacekeeping missions 
caroline dulin a spokeswoman for the us mission to the united 
nations said the administration had no reaction to the reports 
on sept 13 reagan announced he would release 188 million in 
unpaid american dues saying he was satisfied with the uns 
progress on budgetary and other reforms and approved the payment 
but ever since reagan took office eight years ago his 
administration has harshly criticized the united nations for what 
it calls antiwestern bias bureaucracy and waste and has withheld 
700 million in dues to the regular budget peacekeeping forces and 
un agencies 
eckhard pointed out that south africa cuba and angola have 
approved nov 1 as the date on which the united nations can begin 
implementing an independence plan for southwest africa also known 
as namibia 
the independence plan is estimated to cost 600 million to 700 
million for one year and eckhard said the united nations would 
need 100 million to 200 million up front to launch the plan 
funds the world body doesnt have 
the united nations has no reserve funds and operates by 
spending dues it collects almost as soon as it receives them 
eckhard said the united nations has so far only collected a 
fraction of the 357 million it assessed members for the first 
quarter of a peacekeeping mission in the persian gulf 
another peacekeeping operation that may require un funds is a 
proposal to send 2000 observers to the western sahara to monitor a 
referendum on independence for the region

time is running out for three california 
gray whales trapped in the thickening ice of the arctic ocean and 
the discussion saturday was turning from rescue to humane 
destruction 
the young whales have been stranded for more than a week by new 
ice about 18 miles northeast of this inupiat eskimo community the 
mammals are in shallow water only a few hundred feet offshore 
where they have been rising to the surface every couple of minutes 
to breath through small and shrinking holes in the ice 
they are four to five miles from open water 
the ice around the whales has become pretty solid said 
geoff carroll a wildlife biologist with the north slope borough 
you can walk right up to the edge and take a look 
theyve been bumping up against the ice and their heads are 
scraped and cut taking a closer look at them i dont think they 
have more than a week or so to go carroll said 
biologists have said they feared the breathing holes could 
freeze over or be slammed shut by the drifting ice 
the wind had kind of changed yesterday coming more from the 
northwest which isnt good carroll said that could close the 
major lead and if that closes then all our rescue efforts are 
pretty futile 
no icebreaking vessels are closer than 200 miles and 
suggestions ranging from blasting a trail through the ice to the 
open sea or tranquilizing the whales to somehow move them to 
freedom have been discussed and discarded biologists said 
the alaska army national guard meanwhile authorized the use 
saturday of a huge skycrane helicopter which is capable of lifting 
up to 25000 pounds of cargo 
the helicopter is to be used to transport a hoverbarge from 
the prudhoe bay oilfields to where the whales are trapped near 
barrow a distance of about 200 miles said mike haller a guard 
spokesman 
well be heading north at first light tomorrow haller said 
it probably will take us all day to move from here anchorage to 
prudhoe then well go to work to get the barge to barrow we could 
be there sometime monday afternoon 
if things go as planned the icebreaking barge would be used to 
clear a path to open water haller said 
we dont know how much time we have but we understand its 
situation getting pretty critical haller said 
the people in barrow who harvest a small number of larger 
bowhead whales each season for food and other uses have begun 
talking about the possibility of killing the whales if they remain 
trapped much longer 
i dont want to make any attempt to speak for everybody up 
here but couple of whaling boat captains i talked to said if the 
whales cant be gotten out of the ice theyd hate to watch them 
suffer carroll said 
theyd rather quickly and efficiently put them out of their 
misery than watch them die a slow and agonizing death with the 
stress theyve been under the meats not going to be of a very 
good quality anyway 
its a desire to put them out of their misery rather than an 
attempt to harvest them carroll said 
arnold brower a village elder and whaling captain said 
community leaders want to meet with government officials this 
weekend to sort out the options 
it looks like they havent rested for a long period of time 
brower said theyre struggling there theyre just like we are 
fighting for survival 
we have to do something decide to put them to sleep or help 
them out 
gray whales generally spend their summers feeding in the 
beaufort sea off alaskas north slope then migrate south through 
the bering strait in the fall 
they spend their winters in the warm waters off mexico and 
southern california

george bush vowing to go the extra 
mile to fight hard in the closing weeks of the presidential race 
campaigned saturday with hollywood stars and timetested attacks on 
democratic rival michael dukakis 
fighting for an advantage in california where the contest is 
too close to call bush rode down state highway 99 on a bus tour 
through the san joaquin valley trying to energize republicans and 
win over democrats who had put their allegiance aside to vote for 
president reagan 
california could well be the single key to this election 
bush told hundreds of people gathered for a main street rally in 
ripon population 6700 
as his caravan rolled past highway crowds bushs wife barbara 
prompted him to stick his head out the right window and wave son 
jeb bush spotting a larger crowd on the left called out dad 
you ought to get on the other side he promptly switched 
here we go entering the home stretch of this national 
presidential election bush declared earlier at a noisy kickoff 
rally in an airport hangar in modesto he pledged to redouble our 
efforts for the next 24 days and go the extra mile to fight 
hard 
were going to take the high road and leave the pessimism and 
the tearing down of america to somebody else 
stressing differences with dukakis bush told crowds he supports 
voluntary prayer in public schools and recitation of the pledge of 
allegiance i dont believe we need more federal gun control i 
dont want somebody from harvard telling me what i can do and what 
i cant do bush said 
bush was accompanied by actors telly savalas and chuck norris 
and by beach boys singers mike love and bruce johnston 
the vice president closed his daylong trip with a tailgate party 
at fresno state university where its bulldogs met utah state in a 
football game he told the picnicing crowd im absolutely 
confident that if i can win the state of california i will be the 
next president of the united states 
from fresno bush was flying to denver where he planned to spend 
two nights 
at the start of the day bush told reporters on air force two 
that he was going to stick with familiar themes and not do anything 
new that might jeopardize the lead that polls indicate he has 
im not going to mess up bush said might make a mistake 
about pearl harbor but im not going to mess up in a 
wellpublicized blooper he mistakenly said last month that the 
anniversary of the japanese attack on pearl harbor was sept 7 
instead of dec 7 
my sense is that we seem to be moving in the right direction 
but keep on going bush said i dont think youll see any 
change in game plan or anything of that nature 
he said his campaign theme saturday was no different than any 
other day 
insisting there is not one scintilla of overconfidence in my 
makeup bush said were going to drive right down to the 
wire 
he said dukakis is not going to outhustle me outwork me 
refusing to speculate about victory bush said i cant look 
back and i cant look forward beyond nov 8 either 
he said he was locked into a unifocus 
youre talking to a guy that maybe even some here thought was 
out of the race from time to time he said asking why he should 
now turn around and think everything is roses 
asked if he had a plan to help the battered savings and loan 
industry bush said nobody knows how much it will cost 
taxpayers for a bailout 
it would be a good place to start and reassure the depositors 
that they are in no jeopardy at all bush said told that senate 
republican leader bob dole had estimated it might cost the 
government as much as 50 billion bush said i have no plan for 
a 50 billion bailout 
some analysts have suggested a merger of the wellfinanced 
federal deposit insurance corp with the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp but bush said i dont believe we need to do 
that right now we need to keep working out of the difficulties and 
be sure that the funds are available for these takeovers and to 
protect the depositors above all

uniformed men identifying 
themselves as soldiers took four young peasants from their homes 
tied them up shot them in the head and left their bodies laid out 
in a row relatives said saturday 
the relatives said the men who came to the village friday night 
identified their unit as the 1st army brigade and said they were 
just carrying out orders 
the allegations came only weeks after an incident in which 
soldiers allegedly massacred 10 peasants in the san vicente 
province the soldiers accused the peasants of collaborating with 
leftist guerrillas who are at war with the usbacked government 
a federal judge issued arrest warrants thursday for four 
soldiers implicated in those killings but there have been no 
arrests 
army spokesman lt ricardo mendoza said the military had no 
information on the latest incident in the village of tres ceibas 
11 miles north of san salvador 
alfonso ayala a judiciary official at the scene called the 
killings executions 
uniformed men took away and killed my son they said they were 
from the 1st army brigade said mario chavarria flores the 
father of cornelio marroquin 25 
in addition to cornelio marroquin relatives said the dead 
included oscar marroquin 19 pedro marroquin 20 and gertrudis 
rivera 25 the three marroquins are distant relatives 
the relatives said the four were not partisans of either side in 
the 9year civil war which has claimed an estimated 65000 lives 
the relatives said several men in army uniforms came to this 
isolated hamlet at about 10 pm friday 
the men knocked on the doors of several houses asking for 
people by name the villagers said the four they found were then 
bound by the thumbs and marched off the relatives said 
minutes later the relatives heard gunshots 
they found the bodies laid in a row about 30 yards from the 
homes all had been shot in the head 
chavarria said he tried to follow when the men took away his 
son but they shot over my head and told me to look for him 
tomorrow saturday at the 1st brigade 
i felt so powerless but they had their guns pointed at me 
and what could i do said chavarria his face lined with tears 
in the sept 21 incident in san francisco in san vicente 
province the killers wore jiboa battalion insignia and were 
readily identified as such by dozens of witnesses the army 
acknowledged jiboa soldiers were operating in the village the day 
of the killings 
rebels sometimes kill civilians suspected of collaborating with 
the armed forces but they usually claim responsibility for such 
actions 
the armed forces and rightist death squads were blamed for 
widespread human rights violations in el salvador in the late 1970s 
and early 1980s the situation improved over the last few years 
but human rights organizations say political murders are on the 
rise again

nbc on saturday unveiled its proposal for a new 
highquality television system which the network said could bring 
enhanced sound and picture quality into american homes within three 
years 
nbc presented its proposal for production standards for 
highdefinition television to the society of motion pictures and 
television engineers at the groups convention saturday in new york 
the standards have the backing of a number of us television 
makers and abctv said nbc 
it will not make obsolete the existing 160 million tv sets 
americans now own said nbc spokesman joe rutledge 
highdefinition tv produces clearer brighter images on a wider 
tv screen with highquality sounds demand for highdefinition 
television is expected to grow substantially in the next few years 
as picture tubes become larger and screens wider the advancement 
is also seen as a technology to put new life in the american 
electronics industry rutledge said 
the federal communications commission last month set preliminary 
guidelines to allow research to proceed toward establishing an 
american highdefinition system under the fcc guidelines a us 
system must be able to be received on existing tv sets so current 
equipment would not become obsolete but to receive improved 
picture quality viewers would have to buy a new tv set 
the fccs action rutledge said removed a lot of the 
regulatory hoops and is expected to facilitate approval of 
nbcs proposed standards 
although technological developments and congressional and 
regulatory approval are yet to be completed the television 
industry is hopeful that it can be achieved within three years 
rutledge said 
about 20 advancedtv systems are under development and competing 
to be designated as the us standard 
the society of motion pictures and television engineers sets 
national standards in television production and motion pictures 
the standards announced by nbc have been endorsed by the abctv 
network as well as several television makers including zenith and 
north american philips nbc said 
rutledge said nbc had invested some 50 million in the 
technology

the sunday telegraph reported that a soviet double 
agent who worked for british intelligence for 10 years said that in 
1983 the soviets were convinced the west was about to attack 
it based its report on excerpts from the book the storm 
birds by gordon brookeshepherd which deals with soviet 
defectors 
the sunday telegraph account said that in an interview soviet 
defector oleg gordievski told brookeshepherd that president reagan 
toned down his evil empire approach to the kremlin after 
gordievski warned about mounting tension in the soviet leadership 
the newspaper said gordievski was the top official of the soviet 
kgb secret police in britain when he defected in july 1985 
it said gordievski passed on warnings about the level of war 
panic in the soviet union and that led to a change of western 
tactics 
gordievski was quoted in the storm birds as saying the 
soviets believed an attack from the west would use military 
maneuvers as camouflage and a november 1983 nato exercise codenamed 
able archer triggered the panic 
he also was quoted as saying the kremlin sent an urgent order to 
all kgb agents abroad to report anything that might indicate the 
west was preparing to launch a nuclear strike 
in britain this involved looking for signs of food stockpiling 
emergency blood banks and noting whether prime minister margaret 
thatcher was driving more often than usual to buckingham palace 
according to the account 
referring to reagan the book said the white house had until 
then gordievskis warning fondly believed that through the 
reports to moscow of men like anatoly dobrynin soviet ambassador 
to washington over more than two decades the picture of an 
essentially peaceloving and peaceseeking america would have been 
presented 
it now transpired that for much of the time even this 
respected veteran had been telling his masters more or less what 
they wanted to hear 
in an article accompanying the excerpt brookeshepherd wrote 
that gordievski said it was the sovietled invasion of 
czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush a liberalcommunist government that 
led to gordievskis defection after a prolonged spiritual and 
emotional struggle 
the newspaper said gordievski had been recruited in copenhagen 
in 1974 by british intelligence 
brookeshepherd wrote that gordievski was in moscow in may 1985 
when he felt the kgb closing in and he had to escape to britain 
the most agonizing decision of his life was to leave behind in 
moscow his wife leila and their two daughters maria and anna 
the author wrote 
the storm birds will be published by weidenfeld on oct 27

the paternal grandparents of a baby born 
and abandoned in an airplane restroom will be allowed to keep the 
child in their new york home but the court will retain legal 
custody of the infant a court ruled friday 
a san mateo county juvenile court judge said 3monthold alyssa 
locasto will remain with her grandparents in the new york city 
borough of staten island the baby has been living with her 
grandparents john and frances locasto since august 
the infant was found abandoned in the restroom of an airplane 
after it landed at san francisco international airport on july 13 
the childs mother christina locasto 24 who turned herself in 
the next day gave birth secretly just before the flight left 
newark nj and has pleaded innocent to a charge of felony child 
endangerment 
christina locasto and her husband louis locasto also of staten 
island had been having domestic problems when alyssa was conceived 
and the father did not know his wife had been pregnant or had given 
birth just before the flight authorities said 
each parent will be allowed to visit their daughter under the 
supervision of a department of social services official for six 
hours per week the visitation hours were increased from one hour a 
week 
the court also ordered the couple to continue in counseling and 
required sanmateo and new york authorities to provide services with 
the goal of reuniting the family

said but that is unlikely for at least a year said an attorney 
representing louis locasto 
no family members attended the hearing friday and the custody

100000 each friday and ordered them to leave the country after 
they pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the us economic 
embargo on libya 
a moroccan manhal b mohamed was fined 100000 but still 
sought to avoid deportation in the case which began in july with 
the arrest of the four arabs the judge has yet rule on his 
possible deportation

ramadan t balgasem all former officials of the peoples committee 
for libyan students based in mclean va 
libya established the organization to disburse money to libyan 
students in this country but prosecutors charged that it also was

sanctions imposed by the reagan administration

sitting in alexandria va he fined the four and ordered the 
libyans out of the country by nov 10

the agriculture department is going to buy an 
additional 120 million worth of food for distribution to needy 
people next year under recently enacted antihunger legislation 
assistant secretary john w bode said friday the food will be 
purchased by usda and sent to food banks and other outlets 
beginning in january and continuing through september 1989 
bode said the quantities of food purchased will depend on 
market conditions at the time but that plans now call for the 
commodities to include peanut butter canned pork beans egg mix 
and raisins 
the program is the temporary emergency food assistance program 
or tefap which began in december 1981 when president reagan 
authorized distribution of governmentowned food to help reduce the 
surplus stockpile of certain commodities notably cheese but also 
including a variety of other products 
as tefap developed the surpluses dwindled so that the 
department has had to trim the list of items for donation after 
giving away more than 5 billion pounds of food worth more than 5 
billion 
that is when congress stepped in with the recent hunger 
prevention act of 1988 which authorizes about 165 billion over 
three years to bolster the governments emergency food programs 
including more funds for food stamps school breakfasts childcare 
and summer food programs 
the law also extended tefap for two years and provided money for 
the additional purchases 
bode said that in addition to the 120 million of additional 
purchases the usdas commodity credit corp still has 1219 
million worth of food available for tefap and is continuing to make 
it available at current monthly rates of 6 million pounds of 
butter 4 million pounds of cornmeal and 12 million pounds of flour 
thus the total tefap funding is 2419 million for the remainder 
of the fiscal year that began on oct 1 said dianne durant a 
spokeswoman for the departments food and nutrition service 
in addition she said congress earmarked 40 million to help 
feed homeless people at soup kitchens and shelters foods most 
likely to be provided are canned pork dry beans and canned fruit 
vegetables and juices

the little tax bill that nobody loved is 
hanging by a thread because house and senate negotiators cant 
agree on how big it should be 
house negotiators are insisting on a bill that raises at least 
45 billion over three years to pay for 45 billion of selected 
tax cuts senators backed by the reagan administration are 
refusing to budge above 3 billion 
the dispute torpedoed closeddoor discussions on the bill friday 
and house aides were saying the measure probably is dead sen max 
baucus dmont who is heading the senate delegation was not so 
pessimistic 
we have not selected the pallbearers yet he said adding 
that senate aides would look over the latest house proposal over 
the weekend then well see what the mood is next week the 
final week of the 100th congress baucus said 
tax bills usually are highly popular items with members of 
congress simply because lawmakers have found there is little that 
makes voters happier than a tax cut 
but because of a monumental budget deficit there is no surplus 
money in the treasury to finance a lot of tax cuts so every dollar 
of tax cut for peter must be offset by a dollar tax increase on 
paul 
that is why this years bills are so relatively small about 
75 billion as originally passed by the house and just under 3 
billion in the senate version 
the bills two years in the making have not been a toppriority 
item for either the house the senate or the reagan administration 
the only big push for passage has come from accountants eager to 
have some errors and ambiguities in the 1986 tax law cleared up 
and from farmers demanding relief from the tax on diesel fuel 
either bill would respond to those concerns both bills also 
extend several expiring tax benefits provide targeted relief to 
lowerincome homebuyers workers attending night school farmers 
and others and raise other taxes to pay for the benefits the 
senate package also includes a bill of rights to help taxpayers 
involved in disputes with the internal revenue service 
the exchange of offers before negotiations were broken off 
indicated some form of the bill of rights will be in the final bill 
if there is one in addition it would repeal the requirement 
that farmers pay the diesel tax on offroad fuel and then apply for 
a refund and also prevent mutual fund owners from paying tax on 
phantom income from those funds 
the negotiations are complicated by the fact that sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee is also 
his partys candidate for vice president ever since he was 
nominated in july there have been indications he did not want to 
be identified closely with a bill that opponents could point to as 
new evidence of a democratic tendency to raise taxes to finance 
more spending 
senator bentsens position all year long has been that he is 
not interested in raising a lot of taxes to be plowed back into 
other tax cuts said bill maddox a finance committee spokesman 
on the other hand rep dan rostenkowski dill head of the 
house delegation points out that his bill passed the house by a 
38025 vote the widest margin for a tax bill in 20 years his 
aides say it is difficult for rostenkowski to drop provisions that 
got such broad support 
the senate bill passed by an even more lopsided margin 871 
in backing away from their 7 billionplus package house 
negotiators agreed to drop a moneyraiser opposed by the reagan 
administration that would require corporations to pay more tax on 
dividends from stocks they own in other companies 
the house also agreed to modify slightly its call for repeal of 
the completedcontract accounting method used by defense 
contractors and many large builders this method allows 
postponement on some building profits 
under the proposed compromise the benefit would be retained 
only for construction of housing

a former government financial officer who 
admitted embezzling 137 million received a stern lecture and a 
fiveyear prison sentence from a judge who ordered him immediately 
put behind bars 
us district judge norma holloway johnson ignored an 
impassioned plea friday by a defense lawyer to give william j 
burns 10 more days with his wife and twin sons towheaded toddlers 
who could be heard screaming outside the courtroom 
i know they love mr burns very much and they would very much 
like him to be with them but my responsibility is just quite 
different johnson told defense attorney david r addis 
burns wife kathy a daughter from a previous marriage and 
other relatives sobbed loudly as he was led off to prison by us 
marshals 
burns pleaded guilty aug 11 to charges he emezzled 12 million 
since 1982 from the agency for international development where he 
had worked for 21 years until his arrest last may 
he agreed to surrender his 300000 house and virtually all his 
possessions as part of a plea agreement with justice department 
prosecutors 
burns later admitted that the scheme actually began in 1980 and 
included thefts that brought the total to 137 million 
prosecutors said 
i find it significant that you persisted for over five years 
in perpetrating this criminal activity against the taxpayers of the 
united states johnson told burns explaining why she thought he 
deserved a harsher sentence than recommended under the sentencing 
guidelines 
under the guidelines burns would have received a sentence 
ranging from 31 to 37 months burns must serve the full five years 
of his prison sentence under a 1984 law that abolished parole for 
such convictions 
burns was also ordered to perform 300 hours of community service 
during the three years following his release from prison 
you may have felt it was some faceless government but you 
were stealing from the taxpayers of the united states the judge 
said the united states from which you stole is actually the 
people who are here in the courtroom supporting you 
you violated every bit of trust that anyone had ever put in 
you the judge said noting that in your devious manner stole 
at a rate that made it difficult for it to be ascertained 
if there had not been an investigation there is no reason for 
me to believe it would have stopped in may 1988 the judge said 
the scheme began to unravel late last year when aid 
investigators doing a routine security check on burns discovered he 
lived in an expensive home even though his annual salary was just 
over 35000 
burns admitted submitting phony travel reimbursement forms to a 
fictitious person in whose name he opened a bank account he 
pleaded guilty to theft filing false claims and tax evasion 
prosecutor james cole said the theft if not the largest is 
certainly one of the largest single thefts of public funds in 
us history the money was not stolen out of a need it was 
stolen out of pure greed 
cole said burns used the money to buy any luxury he wanted to 
lavish on himself and his family 
his conduct exhibited the attitude of i can spend whatever i 
want because i have unlimited funds in the treasury of the united 
states because of my position of trust 
among the items burns bought were a sports car and commercial 
videogames which cost 2500 apiece cole said 
afterwards addis said burns would file an appeal of the 
sentencing which is allowed when a judge departs from the 
guidelines

political extremist lyndon h larouche 
jr is facing new criminal charges he defrauded lenders of 34 
million and federal prosecutors vow this case will be resolved more 
quickly than their first one against him 
larouche who is running for president as an independent and 
six of his associates were charged with conspiracy and fraud here 
friday by a federal grand jury which said they borrowed the money 
from individuals around the country over four years with no 
intention of repaying it 
us attorney henry hudson said the 13count indictment was the 
culmination of a twoyear investigation which began in october 1986 
with an fbi and internal revenue service raid on larouche 
headquarters in leesburg va a truck load of documents tape 
recordings and records was seized on that occasion 
larouche was named in all 13 counts he was charged with 
conspiracy to commit mail fraud 11 counts of mail fraud and 
conspiracy to defraud the irs 
hudson called the case a lean 13count indictment and 
predicted it would be tried in a few weeks of testimony and 
completed before larouche is scheduled to be retried in boston in 
early january on other federal conspiracy charges 
there were indications that federal officials had set out to 
avoid or overcome what hudson agreed was a blizzard of defense 
motions which helped land the boston case in a mistrial last may 
after six months in court the mistrial came when four jurors 
complained about the length and conduct of the case 
two federal sources who declined to be identified said early 
drafts of the virginia indictment contained racketeering charges 
which toplevel justice department officials dropped from the case 
before the grand jury was asked to vote there have been lengthy 
court challenges from defendants when the justice department uses 
racketeering charges in cases that do not involve traditional 
organized crime 
noting the federal judges in his district have a reputation 
for moving cases quickly hudson predicted our judges will 
rule with dispatch on any defense motions 
larouches attorneys unsuccessfully sought friday to delay the 
virginia indictment until after the nov 8 election saying it 
would interfere with larouches campaigning in 12 states and the 
district of columbia 
but the request for a temporary restraining order was rejected 
by judge stanley sporkin in washington 
the grand jury said that larouche had not filed a federal income 
tax return since at least 1979 and conspired to conceal an 
undetermined amount spent on his behalf by having his living 
expenses paid out of bank accounts in the names of corporations 
associated with his major organization the national caucus of 
labor committees 
the grand jury charged that during the 1984 presidential 
campaign committees supporting larouche for president borrowed 
43 million 
the grand jurors said that between late 1983 and early 1987 
commercial entities controlled by larouche borrowed more than 30 
million 
the indictment said loans from 165 to 200000 were raised by 
telephone solicitors who promised specific interest payments and 
specific repayment dates assured the lenders the loans were good 
investments and that the organization had a good history of 
repayment all the while knowing that larouches groups had no 
intention of repaying the money 
the other defendants were william wertz described as larouches 
fundraising chief edward spannaus described as larouches legal 
chief and four individual fundraisers michael billington dennis 
small paul greenberg and joyce rubinstein 
they were all charged with conspiracy to commit mail fraud and 
various counts of mail fraud 
larouche faces a potential maximum penalty of 65 years in prison 
and a fine of 325 million on the indictment returned friday the 
others would face various lesser penalties 
hudson said he expected larouche and the other six defendants to 
appear voluntarily for arraignment in federal court on monday 
afternoon 
at a news conference outside the us attorneys office dana 
scanlon a larouche spokesman called the indictment political 
dirty tricks inspired by former justice department criminal 
division chief william weld who she said had become a legal 
associate of paul brountas campaign manager for democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis 
she said she could not explain how the dukakis campaign could 
engineer an indictment during the reagan administration 
hudson rejected the allegation lyndon larouche is being 
treated just as any other citizen would be who is charged with 
committing a crime he said 
the indictment said that larouche personally controlled the 
entire operation and told supporters the population at large 
consisted of freeloaders who owed the organization money 
for saving them from various holocausts and that people who 
did not give money to his organization were not morally fit to 
survive

better enforcement is needed within programs 
that compel absent parents to pay child support rep thomas 
downey dny said in releasing a report card that found 
fault with both federal and state agencies 
the federal office of child support enforcement received a grade 
of c on the report released friday while the states and 
territories ran a gamut from a to f for programs to ensure that 
noncustodial parents support their children 
parenting in this society has been a free ride a joyride 
downey said in calling for tighter enforcement 
what were dealing with here is much more important than just 
dollars said rep hank brown rcolo who joined downey at the 
news conference taking responsibility for your children is very 
important ot these children 
in the united states there are currently nearly 9 million 
mothers with children whose fathers do not live with them downey 
said only about 2 million of these families received their full 
child support payments in 1985 another 1 million families received 
partial payments and almost 6 million received nothing 
we can and should do better downey said 
a mandatory wage withholding provision that is included in the 
welfare law signed by president reagan on thursday will help 
resolve the problem said downey who is acting chairman of the 
ways and means subcommittee on public assistance and unemployment 
compensation 
the report card written by the staff of the house ways and 
means committee graded the federal office of child support 
enforcement based on questionnaires sent to the 54 state and 
territorial child support enforcement programs it also graded each 
of the state and territorial programs based on questionnaire 
responses and other data 
wayne stanton administrator of the family support 
administration which oversees ocse said he was not displeased 
with the offices showing on the report card 
i think in the ultimate end this report will tend to improve 
child support around the nation and thats what i care about 
stanton said 
the ocse a part of the health and human services department 
was rated in nine areas including how it establishes standards for 
state child support enforcement programs sets minimum 
organizational and staffing equirements for the states reviews and 
approves state plans conducts audits and evaluations of state 
plans and operates the federal parent locator service 
ocse got some of its highest marks bs for the locator 
service and certifying cases in which states apply to have pastdue 
child support money taken out of an absent parents income tax 
refund 
the states grades ranged from excellent to failing but as 
downey noted they were marked on a curve 
the state of michigan is the valedictorian of the class he 
said three other states delaware new jersey and north dakota 
also earned an a 
seven jurisdictions flunked mississippi new mexico oklahoma 
texas west virginia the district of columbia and guam however 
guam failed for lack of data the report said 
states were graded on how they establish paternity collect 
child support operate costeffectively collect interstate 
payments and reduce welfare costs 
the average paternity establishment rate was 31 percent 
according to the report three states exceeded 75 percent 
missouri vermont and north dakota states under 10 percent were 
arizona montana new hampshire new mexico oklahoma texas west 
virginia and wyoming no data were available for three territories 
the national average collection rate was 30 percent in cases of 
families receiving aid to families with dependent children and 39 
percent in nonafdc cases 
the average collection cost nationwide for afdc cases was 149 
per dollar of administrative expense and 261 in nonafdc cases 
states recovered about 12 percent and avoided an estimated 5 
percent of afdc costs by collecting child support

telephone callers using bell credit cards will 
have a wider range of services available to them under a federal 
judges order requiring the regional bell companies to stop 
discriminating in favor of atampt on longdistance calls 
the ruling gives the bell companies 75 days to begin routing 
longdistance calls that are not dialed directly to the 
longdistance carrier to which the caller has presubscribed such 
as mci or sprint 
calls placed with a bell calling card or which use a bell 
operator now go over atampt lines automatically unless the caller 
has a credit card with another company and uses an access code to 
bypass the local bell operator and reach that longdistance carrier 
thus the ruling applies primarily to nonatampt longdistance 
customers who for whatever reason do not carry a nonatampt credit 
card it also will allow holders of such cards to charge local 
calls which now can be done only with a bell card 
us district judge harold h greene ordered the bell companies 
to cease discriminating in favor of atampt with respect to their 
calling cards and pay phones by jan 1 1989 the fifth 
anniversary of the court order that stripped atampt of its local 
operating companies 
five years is long enough for the baby bells as they are 
called to provide equal access to their local networks for all 
longdistance companies and the court expects the parties to 
meet its deadline greene said 
callers using credit cards issued by mci communications corp 
us sprint communications co and other atampt competitors are not 
afforded the same services as atampt and bell card holders for 
example they are unable to charge local calls to their card or to 
charge longdistance calls made through a bell operator 
before divestiture when american telephone amp telegraph co and 
the local companies were part of the giant bell system they used 
the same database to validate and bill creditcard calls 
after divestiture because of the use of the common database 
atampt and the bell companies issued the same calling card number for 
any particular customer 
consequently all longdistance calls made with bell cards were 
directed to atampt also calls from bellowned pay phones also were 
routed to atampt 
mci the nations secondlargest longdistance company after 
atampt complained about the arrangement to the justice department 
which asked greene to stop the bells from discriminating in favor 
of atampt 
in his decision greene ordered the bells by jan 1 to make 
available to all longdistance carriers the same validation data 
for its calling cards that the company provides to atampt on the 
same prices terms and conditions as are extended to atampt this 
means bell cardholders will be able to charge longdistance calls 
to their carrier of choice 
he also ruled that the owners of premises where bell pay phones 
are located will be able to choose by jan 1 which longdistance 
company the calls from that phone will be routed to 
nearly half of all calls from bell pay phones are 
operatorassisted yielding more than 1 billion in revenues a year 
most of it to atampt greene said 
in addition greene said the baby bells must inform its 
callingcard customers that longdistance calls charged to the card 
will be provided by a longdistance company not the bell company 
but not always the carrier to which they presubscribed as a 
dial1 service on their home phone 
the judge also said the regional companies could keep in 
circulation but only for atampt customers bell credit cards that 
carry the same international number as used by atampt provided they 
issue cards to other customers listing the international number of 
the longdistance company to which they presubscribed

mrs thatcher made her bluntest rejection yet of what she 
regards as unrealistic talk about a socalled united states of 
europe 
and sensitive to charges that britons who have become wealthier 
through nearly a decade of her rightwing government have also 
become greedier mrs thatcher urged generosity as a cornerstone of 
her program for the 1990s 
those who care and they are the great majority of us now 
have the means to give mrs thatcher said in a keynote address 
friday to party delegates 
opposition leader neil kinnock who at his labor partys 
convention last week described the thatcher theme as no number 
other than one no person other than me commented it 
obviously struck a raw nerve 
as mrs thatcher ended her speech the 4500 delegates broke 
into applause and chanted 10 more years the 63yearold prime 
minister stood with her arms raised in acknowledgement before 
leaving the hall to strains of the song land of hope and glory 
already the longestserving leader in the western world and 16 
months into her third fiveyear term mrs thatcher signaled plans 
to run for an unprecedented fourth term or longer 
we are all too young to put our feet up i include 
myself mrs thatcher said 
the conservative party occupies the common ground of british 
politics and so it has fallen to us to lead britain into the 
1990s and who knows beyond 
mrs thatchers remarks on the common market followed a 
controversial speech last month in which she rejected moves for 
closer political or monetary union after 1992 when all trade 
barriers among the member nations are due to be dismantled 
of course that wasnt at all convenient for those who want to 
bring about a federal europe by stealth mrs thatcher said 
we havent worked all these years to free britain from the 
paralysis of socialism only to see it creep through the back door 
of central control and bureaucracy from brussels she said 
referring to the eec headquarters 
mrs thatcher argued that britain has taken a lead in tackling 
practical issues in europe such as the 1992 single market and 
agricultural subsidy reforms with those sort of credentials no 
one should doubt britains wholehearted commitment to europe 
on social issues she urged britons to give more to charity and 
assist in crime prevention and promised new efforts to preserve the 
environment 
freedom entails responsibilities first to the family then to 
the neighbors then to the nation and beyond she said 
the conservatives finished the conference the last in britains 
autumn season of political conventions with polls showing mrs 
thatcher maintaining a comfortable 5point lead over labor which 
is struggling to devise a new more moderate platform

the house and senate each having completed 
its own sweeping drug bill hope they can agree on a compromise 
measure quickly next week and leave town to spend the final weeks 
of the campaign season at home 
the senate passed a 26 billion version of the legislation 
friday on an 873 vote with the house having approved a stricter 
21 billion bill last month the next step is for lawmakers to 
agree on a final product they can send president reagan for his 
signature 
both bills fire shots in all directions in an effort to reduce 
drug usage in the united states they would increase spending on 
law enforcement and treatment programs create a death penalty for 
many drug offenders who commit murders stiffen sentences for a 
range of drug offenses and spur federal efforts to obtain better 
cooperation from countries where drugs are produced 
no matter how dedicated local law enforcement is they do not 
have the manpower nor the resources to fight organized drug 
trafficking said senate majority leader robert byrd dwva 
this is the first live shot in the war against drugs said 
sen bob dole rkan the senate minority leader 
many liberals disagreed although most of them voted for final 
passage many of them opposed parts of the bill saying they were 
too harsh and arguing that the measure appears tough but will do 
little to solve the countrys narcotics woes 
just to grow hair on your chest here on the senate floor so 
you can send out press releases back home and tell everybody how 
tough you are on drugs is no solution said sen dale bumpers 
dark it is a multifaceted problem and the solutions are 
multifaceted 
the american civil liberties union called the measure a 
serious threat to civil liberties singling out language 
providing for the death penalty imposing drug testing on many 
transportation industry workers and allowing lawmakers to next 
year limit prisoners rights to appeal their sentences 
white house officials distributed a statement to senators friday 
saying reagan strongly supports enactment of a sound prudent 
and effective antidrug bill substantially like the housepassed 
version without further delay 
lawmakers also must decide how to pay for the programs the 
legislation creates lawmakers and aides say congress might 
consider a separate bill next week or in 1989 that would actually 
provide the money and add to the deficit 
the 600page bill contained language requiring warning labels on 
alcoholic beverage containers strengthening child pornography 
laws inducing police to seize the drivers licenses of drunken 
drivers on the spot and banning the sale or possession of plastic 
guns that cannot be detected by screening devices 
courts could decree the death penalty for people engaged in 
illegal drug activities who kill civilians or law officers 
liberals tried but failed to substitute mandatory life imprisonment 
the bill would distribute 676 million to federal agencies to 
hire 3287 additional law officers to purchase helicopters and 
other equipment and to build new prisons another 275 million 
would be dispersed among state and local authorities 
the government would provide 1 billion for treatment programs 
including for the training of teachers and health professionals 
the construction of rehabilitation facilities and the initiation of 
corporate antidrug programs for their employees 
people convicted of possessing even small amounts of illegal 
drugs could be fined up to 10000 and could face the loss of many 
types of federal benefits including food stamps and farm payments 
the votes against the bill were cast by sens william proxmire 
dwis dan evans rwash and mark hatfield rore 
not voting were sens david boren dokla pete domenici 
rnm david durenberger rminn john heinz rpa bennett

lawmakers are accusing the department of 
energy of deliberately letting the operators of a governmentowned 
a uranium processing plant send radioactive pollution into the air 
and water of southwestern ohio 
rep jim cooper dtenn said it appeared the agency had given 
itself almost a papal ability to absolve sins 
the company admits it polluted but its defense is that it 
had permission to pollute and doe gave it that permission he 
said friday at a hearing 
the fernald feed materials production center near cincinnati has 
processed uranium for use in nuclear weapons since 1951 and 
discharged radioactive waste into the air a major aquifer and the 
nearby great miami river 
for most of the last 35 years doe sat on its hands and did 
nothing to fix the situation at that plant said rep thomas 
luken dohio 
the energy department said in a recent court filing that at 
first there was no technology to stop the discharges and in recent 
years the money to do so has not been available 
eric fygi the agencys acting general counsel told the 
lawmakers the court documents do not provide a complete picture of 
the situation 
luken who arranged the hearing by the house energy and commerce 
committee panel said the agency admits that it knew for over 20 
years that its waste pits were leaking 
it now admits that it knew that the plants air pollution 
control system was obsolete and deteriorated before it was 
refurbished he said and it now admits that it knew that heavy 
rains swept uraniumcontaminated water into a nearby stream and 
thence into the groundwater 
government nuclear plants were under jurisdiction of the old 
atomic energy commission and its successor nuclear regulatory 
comission before those functions were placed under the department 
of energy when it was formed during the carter administration 
ohios environmental protection chief richard shank told the 
transportation tourism and hazardous materials subcommittee the 
plant has discharged 298000 pounds of uranium into the air and 
167000 pounds of uranium into the great miami river since 1951 
an independent analyst said he suspected actual levels were much 
higher 
there is a lot of evidence that the operator was quite 
negligent said arjun makhijani director of energy programs at 
the institute for energy and environmental research in takoma park 
md many many elementary precautions were not taken 
makhijani expressed doubts about records showing no discharges 
in the 1970s when the plant was badly deteriorating and the federal 
government spending nothing on improvements 
he also questioned the records accuracy because the plant staff 
was unfamiliar with crucial monitoring equipment he said some 
measuring instruments were in poor condition 
most of the radioactive materials which were discharged 
particularly those discharged to the air were not monitored 
makhijani said 
charles zinser of cincinnati told the panel he suspects the 
plants discharges were responsible for the rare cancers that 
afflicted his 8yearold and 2yearold sons 
and joe carvitti whose father joseph carvitti died of liver 
cancer after working at the plant from 1952 to 1974 told the 
subcommittee the death was ruled workrelated by the ohio workers 
compensation bureau a ruling now being appealed a second time by 
nlo inc which operated the plant from the early 1950s until 1986 
the company is being sued for 300 million by 14000 people who 
live or work near the plant the energy department is trying to 
shield the contractor from liability on grounds the company was 
following government orders 
documents filed by the department sept 30 in us district 
court in cincinnati said all actions by the contractor were 
required or approved by the government 
a former assistant manager of the plant weldon adams told the 
subcommittee problems stemmed from lack of money 
but luken and cooper rejected that argument 
i have known of no instance when congress has refused money 
when a health and safety problem is at stake cooper said 
luken called the plant a witchs brew of chemical wastes and 
said the court documents amount to a statement that doe was 
waging a kind of chemical warfare against the community of 
fernald 
the fernald foundry 18 miles northwest of cincinnati is the 
only plant of its kind in the united states it turns uranium into 
ingots needed to make nuclear weapons its also a storage site for 
radioactive and hazardous materials

its not as farreaching as arms control but 
proof that glasnost is on a roll can be seen almost daily in a 
chicago studio where us and soviet filmmakers are producing a 
rock video 
the project the brainchild of recent philosophy graduate robert 
kath brings together seven students from northwestern university 
and moscows victor gerasimov institute of cinematography 
the americans spent three weeks in the soviet union last month 
and the soviets are nearing the end of a similar stint here 
both sides are represented by full crews producers directors 
and cinematographers that have thrashed out their creative 
differences for the video and an accompanying 30minute documentary 
in the finest spirit of compromise 
the most surprising thing kath said is how their eyes 
seem to land on the same things as ours the jazz musicians 
playing in the subway the wealthy bankers walking down lasalle 
street 
once we had agreed on a concept for the video everything else 
was pretty much downhill he added the language of film we 
discovered was a very common thing 
the story line for the fiveminute production is a variation on 
boymeetsgirl a young american girls dreams of dancing with the 
bolshoi ballet but doesnt make it even as a young soviet boys 
dream of coming to america is shattered 
we hoped to show how we are different said soviet director 
boris ayrapetjan and yet the same how our cultures want to be 
closer but how accomplishing that is not as easy as it should be 
we could not show only sweetness and light but even so we 
choose to end the video with the two heroes as children again that 
way there is still hope they will achieve their goals 
we must leave some hope otherwise he continued this 
effort will have been senseless 
the music is the song bridges of trust a collaborative 
effort by soviet composer vladimir kopisov and the american group 
collective vision written for a peace march from leningrad to 
moscow last year 
valentina a backup singer for princes purple rain tour 
sang the lead track like almost everyone else associated with the 
project she donated her services 
each group was responsible for the costs in its country and the 
bill for both the video and documentary is about 250000 
the video will debut at chicagos limelight club next thursday 
depending on whether or not kath can find a sponsor for bridge 
it could wind up being distributed to outlets ranging from mtv to 
film trailers in secondrun movie houses nationwide 
the soviets already have committed to showing the video on 
national television but tatiana storchak vice president of the 
moscow film institute said its air time will be proportional to 
how successful a product it is judged to be 
it is a small piece of film we are used to working with much 
longer he said but we have learned from our collaborators how 
many images can be compacted into a short space how we can work at 
a conscious level and reach even deeper

northern californians love to hate southern californians and 
southern californians love not to care 
so this years golden state world series between the los angeles 
dodgers and the oakland as rekindles a rivalry that has already 
split families and fueled stereotypes of ohsolaidback 
southerners and foggedin northerners 
socal has the sun sand surf punks and a serious attitude 
problem norcal has the giant redwoods mighty rivers and a lot of 
folks who havent heard the 60s are over 
chronically cerebral northern californians get defensive about 
being lumped together with airheads and sunworshipping movie 
stars tired of being misunderstood by the rest of the nation they 
suffer from a severe superiority complex how else can you 
rationalize living in fog when theres yearround sun and fun to be 
had just 500 miles south 
angelenos on the other hand are known not only for getting all 
the attention but for having too much fun to notice 
they hate us because we took their water said la office 
worker ray wiles referring to the arid souths triumph over the 
north in the early part of the century when it won the right to 
import water from the north water that transformed desert into 
paradise 
why should we hate them we have everything wiles said 
weve got the weather weve got the beaches weve got the 
dodgers 
they laugh at us as the blond surfer airheads adds steve 
stoller a 24yearold jobhunting angeleno we look at them as 
liberals from the 60s 
the feelings of animosity are shared on thursday several 
hundred oakland fans some dressed headtotoe in as green and 
gold gathered to send their team south with a party 
us folks up north dont like la said philip franklin of 
oakland as he led the crowd in chants they dont like us they 
not only want our water they want all the baseball glory and we 
cant just let them have any of it 
of course water isnt the only issue more than a few oakland 
residents still hold a grudge against los angeles for stealing 
their beloved oakland raiders now known locally as the oakland 
traitors in a 1982 national football league realignment 
as fan deborah hurtado summed it up neatly were the best 
part of california and were going to prove it 
although bluecollar oakland lives in the shadow of san 
francisco the spiritual and cultural hub across the bay the 
other city is a fitting home for a world series team that 
dominates the diamond through sheer armbashing brawn fans from 
all over northern california root for the mighty as 
san francisco giants fanatics are crossing the league line in 
droves to root against their national league rivals the los 
angeles dodgers 
the giants dugout a san francisco boutique dedicated to 
baseball memorabilia is stocked full of as souvenirs but not a 
single dodgers logo 
famed san francisco trial attorney lawyer melvin belli said hes 
been an as fan since the dodgers got so bad 
were all looking for the as up here belli said theyre 
just too good theyve got great stars and i think theyre really 
going to put em away 
san francisco mayor art agnos has teamed up with oakland mayor 
lionel wilson to pull for the as 
and in a grudging gesture of northern generosity many as fans 
are predicting that the athletics will win the series in five games 
well give em a chance to win one said elizabeth miller of 
berkeley it would dampen their spirits too much if the as did 
them like they did the red sox 
the as trounced boston in four games to sweep the american 
leagues championship series while the dodgers needed seven games 
to dispatch the new york mets

to ward off fearsome memories on the anniversary 
of black monday the watchword among wall streets optimists is 
things are different now 
many followers of the stock market have been heartened in the 
past few months to see the chart of the dow jones industrial 
average diverge from the path it followed in 192930 
for many months there was an eerie parallel in market 
fluctuations during the two periods but recently the 1988 line has 
turned up where the 1930 one headed down 
the main reason is that the most recent crash was not rooted 
in the kind of economic problems that existed in 1928 and 1929 
maintains greg smith at prudentialbache securities 
the optimists also argue that much has changed in the past year 
to allay fears of a repeat of the crash of 1987 
the fundamental underpinnings of the market are vastly 
changed and for the better says norman fosback in the 
investment advisory letter market logic 
a year ago a fundamentally overvalued market was confronted 
with a sudden and rather severe tightening of monetary policy he 
observed the result was disaster 
this october the market has already discounted a tight money 
policy 
fosback also stresses that stock prices by several longstanding 
measures arent at the dangerously high levels they reached in 
1987 
dividend yields on the stocks that make up the major market 
averages got as low as 25 percent at the peak of the bull market 
last year 
never before in the history of the us stock market had 
bluechip stocks offered such low dividend returns he says 
yields now stand in the neighborhood of 37 percent 
priceearnings ratios of those same stocks which surpassed 20 
to 1 last summer now hover around 12 to 1 todays yields and pes 
are at approximately normal levels by fosbacks reckoning 
perhaps more importantly if corporate earnings continue to 
grow at their current pace and the market rises to last years 
high pe ratios would still be below their historical norm 
in the past week the market reached its highest levels since 
the crash but then settled back dow joness average of 30 blue 
chips closed friday at 213318 down 1707 from the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 135 to 
15546 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
lost 108 to 38459 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 127 at 30255 
volume on the big board averaged 14705 million shares a day 
against 16665 million the week before 
fosback says he is by no means arguing that stocks are at 
deepdiscount bargain levels right now 
but he adds the key consideration is that they are far from 
overvalued strong bull markets began in 1966 and 1970 from pe 
ratio levels that were actually higher than that which prevails 
today 
obviously october 19 could recur he acknowledges it 
happened once it can certainly happen again 
the more meaningful question is is it likely to happen any 
time soon to this the answer must be a resounding no 
investors have no need to fear a nearterm replay of oct 19 
1987 indeed current readings on the classic fundamental 
indicators are fully consistent with a bull market scenario

a soontobe released product called the cboe 250 is so eagerly 
anticipated that its introduction has been delayed to make sure 
everyone who wants it can get it 
no its not a car or a computer its a new stockindex 
futures contract the first to be approved by federal regulators 
since last years stockmarket collapse 
its also the first futures contract that will trade on the 
floor of the chicago board options exchange and the first major 
offering of a joint venture between the cboe and the chicago board 
of trade the worlds largest futures market 
the board of trade and the cboe the worlds largest options 
exchange expected about 200 of their members to sign up to trade 
cboe 250 futures instead more than 500 people have expressed 
their intention to participate in the market forcing the exchanges 
to postpone the contracts launch date from nov 1 to nov 11 
this is the first time weve ever put off the launch of a 
contract because of something like this said cbot spokesman ray 
carmichael it could even be that well have to put it off beyond 
the 11th but we still hope to launch it on that date 
the contract is based on the cboe 250 stock index which 
measures the composite performance of the 250 largest stocks traded 
on the new york stock exchange 
the futures contract will allow investors to speculate on the 
indexs performance by committing themselves to buy or sell a 
basket of the underlying stocks for a specified price on a 
specified future date 
the most important feature of the new contract according to 
cboe operations planner william barclay is that it will allow 
players in the cboes popular stock index options markets to hedge 
against losses there thus reducing their risk and the overall risk 
of the markets 
a stockindex option gives the holder an option but not an 
obligation to buy or sell a basket of stocks at a specified price 
on a specified future date 
an investor who has bet via the options market on a rise in 
the stock market could hedge against a loss on that investment by 
selling a cboe 250 futures contract or vice versa 
because futures trading concepts may be unfamiliar to some cboe 
members those who want to trade cboe 250 index futures are 
required to take a futurestrading course and pass a test 
authorized by the commodity futures trading commission the federal 
agency that regulates us futures and options markets 
meanwhile members of the board of trade seeking to participate 
in the new market are not allowed on the cboe floor without first 
attending orientation classes to learn about floor rules peculiar 
to the exchange 
all this processing and training is causing the holdup in 
launching the new contract officials said 
although four other stockindex futures are traded on us 
exchanges with the most successful by far being the chicago 
mercantile exchanges standard amp poors 500 contract the cboe 250 
will be the first launched since the stock markets collapse last 
oct 19 
the crash focused public attention on stockindex futures the 
securities and exchange commission said certain types of 
sophisticated trading activities involving index futures may have 
accelerated the collapse 
a handful of brokerage houses curtailed their involvement in 
those trading activities called program trading and index 
arbitrage in the wake of the publicity that developed 
in index arbitrage traders sell in one market while 
simultaneously buying in another in an attempt to profit from the 
constantly changing prices in both markets one type of program 
trading involves the use of computers for arbitrage trades of huge 
blocks of stocks and stockindex futures contracts 
despite the withdrawal of a few firms from such activities 
analysts say index arbitrage and program trading now play an even 
larger role in the financial markets because many smaller less 
sophisticated investors who fled the markets after the crash have 
not returned 
the cboe 250 index futures will likely become just one more 
avenue for arbitrage said jack barbanel director of futures 
trading with gruntal amp co in new york 
the only benefit i can see of that contract is that it 
provides some interesting arbitrage opportunities between cboe 
options and the futures contract he said it will enable you 
to use a combination of hedging and arbitrage strategies and that 
is really its greatest marketing advantage

the sale of eastern airlines profitable shuttle 
service to casinohotel tycoon donald trump for 365 million in 
cash titillated the airline industry and conjured up images of slot 
machines aboard glitzy jets plying the northeast corridor 
trumps deal with texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo 
announced this past wednesday after a week of speculation had more 
practical effects too 
among its more notable results the sale of the threecity 
shuttle gave a shot in the arm to the flagging junk bonds 
issued by eastern its parent texas air and its sister carrier 
continental airlines 
but the longerterm outlook for the highrisk highyield issues 
is less clear analysts say they warn that lorenzos desire for 
liquid funds may have crippled easterns earnings potential 
when word of talks on the shuttle between trump and lorenzo was 
leaked in advance to the press prices of the securities started 
climbing pushing their yields lower 
the bond market knew this was coming said ray neidl a 
senior bond analyst for mccarthy crisanti amp maffei inc 
the yield on texas airs 1425 percent issue due in 1993 for 
example had dropped to 1587 percent this past friday from nearly 
17 percent before the leaks on the shuttle negotiations 
the highly leveraged texas air excluding its subsidiaries has 
a total of around 525 million in bond issues outstanding eastern 
has nearly 700 million while continental has a hefty 18 
billion the latter includes securities issued by the nowdefunct 
new york air and people express absorbed by continental in 
february 1987 
after trump and lorenzo triumphantly proclaimed the shuttle sale 
to reporters at trumps tony plaza hotel in manhattan standard amp 
poors corp announced that it was keeping a close eye on 
miamibased eastern in the wake of the acquisition 
calling the 365 million anted up by trump a generous price 
the creditrating agency said the interest on that sum could 
recover more than half the cash flow that would be lost by selling 
the shuttle 
standard amp poors had previously given easterns equipment trust 
certificates senior industrial revenue bonds and convertible 
debentures ratings of single b triple ccc and double cc 
respectively the agencys announcement hinted that those ratings 
might be raised in light of the shuttle sale 
its because they get a cash infusion at eastern noted 
michael dahood a corporate bond expert at smith barney upham amp co 
thats the reason for the bullishness affecting the texas air 
and eastern issues the sale on which eastern is expected to clear 
about 240 million gives lorenzo a formidable war chest to 
withstand a strike by easterns militant unions 
the positive impact on continental bonds is more subtle 
however lorenzo said he has been approached by financier carl 
icahn the wily chairman of trans world airlines inc about 
possibly buying the rest of eastern 
the shuttle sale signaled to the bond market that lorenzo could 
be open to the idea of unloading the rest of eastern to icahn or 
another suitor a move that would focus texas airs energy and 
cash on houstonbased continental 
despite the bullishness however analysts warn that texas air 
may have sacrificed easterns potential future earnings on the 
altar of quick cash 
they sold their bestperforming asset said richard bilotti 
a vice president of the highyield bond department at prudential 
bache securities inc thats not a good thing for the long term 
analysts have estimated that the shuttle has a potential cash 
flow of around 70 million a year 
a negative report of eastern earnings or a strike at the carrier 
could quickly knock down the prices of the bonds bilotti warned
