journalists who cover blacks and other minorities 
often hold negative preconceptions that are reflected in their 
studies a panelist at the associated press managing editors 
convention said 
when reporters come to me many times they dont come with an 
objective outlook they come with preconceived notions rae 
parrmoore acting chief of public information and community 
affairs for the district of columbia said friday 
ms parrmoore representing washington mayor marion barry at 
the 56th annual convention said most journalists she deals with 
want to photograph black juvenile delinquents or black drug 
addicts 
i dont get calls for chances to interview or photograph the 
health commissioner ms parrmoore said blacks should be sought 
for their opinions on a wide range of topics including foreign 
policy and health she said 
poverty and drug abuse are often unfairly presented as being 
black problems she said 
editors also were urged to resist hiring minority reporters only 
to cover minority affairs 
washington post reporter juan williams said he does not feel 
obligated to be the voice of the black community simply because 
hes black in fact he said hes often criticized by other blacks 
who feel he should try to censor negative stories 
im aware that the black community wants stories that generate 
positive images williams said but i think silence is a 
greater sin than anything any newspaper has written 
williams said newspapers cannot be afraid to cover stories such 
as the federal drug case against barry that might upset some 
blacks he said the media should demand accountability from black 
elected officials as well as white politicians 
many people have criticized federal authorities for a sting 
operation that led to barrys arrest and conviction on a 
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge some have also labeled as 
racist the sixmonth prison sentence barry received 
dr benjamin hooks executive director of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said barry is 
another example of a government official who overstepped his 
authority 
but hooks said he too felt black elected officials were often 
harassed by federal investigators blacks compose about 1 percent 
of elected officials hooks said however that black officials are 
the targets of 17 percent of the investigations of public 
officials 
there has been a double standard of justice and we need to 
examine all of that hooks said 
apme is comprised of managing editors and other news executives 
of the 1500 member newspapers of the ap the worlds largest news 
gathering organization 
the fourday convention which ended friday drew 263 editors 
from across the nation

editors note consumers may file complaints with kathie a 
kneff enforcement division common carrier bureau federal 
communications commission 2025 m st nw washington dc 20554 
 
washington ap the federal communications commission is 
warning consumers to beware of clever salespeople who try to switch 
their longdistance telephone service without permission 
unauthorized switching sometimes happens as a result of unfair 
sales tactics the fcc said in a statement friday it noted that 
some longdistance companies hire sales groups known as 
telemarketers to sell their services over the phone 
the telemarketers can provide you with useful information 
about special promotions and reduced rates telemarketers may also 
misinterpret any agreement on your part to let them send you 
information about their company to mean that you are ordering their 
service the fcc said 
no one has the right to switch you to a company you dont 
want the commission added people who do get changed can switch 
back or to another company consumers who agreed to the first 
switch must pay a small charge those who didnt agree dont have 
to pay 
however you must pay for any longdistance calls you made 
using the unauthorized longdistance service the fcc said 
state and federal authorities and local phone companies have 
received tens thousands of complaints about unauthorized switching 
particularly in the wake of recent advertising wars among american 
telephone amp telegraph mci communications and us sprint 
an atampt official told a congressional hearing last month that 
90000 of the companys customers had been switched to another 
longdistance service against their will in the past six months 
most complaints have been against mci but the other companies have 
been accused as well 
atampt has sued mci and its telemarketing agent mci said honest 
mistakes can be made 
the fcc urged consumers to make sure a telemarketing agent knows 
they dont want to change service it also suggested they watch out 
for letters thanking them for choosing xyz phone company 
theyve already been switched and to inspect monthly phone bills 
for any changes in service 
consumers should notify the new longdistance company 
immediately if they did not order the service and should also tell 
their local phone companies

president bush didnt make any bones about it 
sometimes you try to buy votes even if only for the price of a 
cup of coffee 
bush stopped by a local coffee shop after a campaign appearance 
here friday for republican house contender j kenneth blackwell 
to the astonishment of the patrons at frischs big boy the 
president and blackwell worked the booths shaking hands and saying 
hello 
then they took seats at the counter bush pulled some bills from 
his pocket and ordered coffee all around 
trying to buy votes a reporter asked 
youre darn right thats what this is all about the 
president replied with a laugh 
it also turned out to be celebrity day at frischs 
two burly young men approached the president for autographs and 
one began to explain typically were asked for autographs but 
 
bush looked up to see two of this citys betterknown residents 
jim breech and lee johnson of the cincinnati bengals football 
team 
one of the guys at the counter truckdriver lee smith was happy 
to sit next to candidate blackwell 
im voting for blackwell because he voted against gun 
control smith said 
by the time the presidents entourage left everyone was in a 
jolly mood even white house chief of staff john sununu not 
usually given to frivolity was gamely snapping a photograph of a 
woman who wanted her picture with bush

bushs next campaign stop was in rochester minn at a high 
school set amid rolling hills and wide expanses of grain fields 
the john marshall high students were pumped up the gymnasium was 
rocking and an american flag as big as the side of a barn was 
stretched behind the stage 
it seemed a bit odd to have mr las vegas in the midst of all of 
this 
but there he was and wayne newton gave a vegasstyle rendition 
of the starspangled banner to welcome bush 
newton was dressed down for the rochester crowd in a dark suit 
instead of his glitzy stage togs but he did show a touch of flair 
with a black tie that was red at the knot 
nobody seemed to know exactly what else newton was doing in 
rochester but bush thanked him as a friend of longstanding who 
flew all the way from las vegas here for this and now back 
tonight 
some of the high schoolers who professed to have knowledge of 
advance planning for the event said that an invitation to rock star 
prince was seriously weighed they did not know how newton was 
chosen instead

the citys finances are a shambles and its 
drug problems seemingly insurmountable 
but the district of columbia is preparing to put the era of 
marion barry behind it by electing a new mayor 
the race features political novice sharon pratt dixon a former 
vice president and attorney with the potomac electric power co 
and onetime city police chief maurice turner 
turner a republican is running in a city where democrats 
outnumber republicans by a 9to1 margin dixon holds a commanding 
lead in the polls and she regards the job of mayor as a great 
opportunity to turn the city around 
there are problems serious ones but ive never been one to 
turn away from an opportunity to make things better she said 
dixon upset four experienced politicians in the democratic 
primary she pledged to root out waste and fraud in district 
government that was just the right message for an electorate that 
spent the summer watching barrys drug and perjury trial he was 
convicted of one count of cocaine possession and sentenced to six 
months in jail 
turner has sought to improve his slim chance for victory by 
pounding away at dixons relative political inexperience 
stressing his 32year police career turner has accused dixon of 
being soft on crime hes also called her cruel and insensitive for 
promising to immediately drop 2000 workers from the city payroll 
to cut costs 
you dont correct the ills of a government run by democrats by 
coming down on the worker turner said i have a lot more 
managerial experience and i know there are better ways to cut 
expenses 
the republican nominee proposes eliminating 6000 people from a 
48000person work force through attrition 
dixon describes turner as a bornagain republican 
criticizing him for his gop conversion last year 
but as the campaign neared its end political observers expected 
dixon to coast to victory 
i think the only chance turner had to win was if he was 
running against barry because then he could have been running 
against crime and corruption said ron richardson a local labor 
leader and political activist 
but sharon is perceived as a clean government candidate 
and that has really left him with no issues richardson said 
barry announced before he was convicted of misdemeanor cocaine 
possession that he would not seek a fourth fouryear term he is 
running instead for a city council seat 
he was sentenced oct 26 to six months in prison fined 5000 
and placed on one years probation 
if she wins barrys job dixons first challenge will be to get 
the citys fiscal house in order the district ran a deficit of 
100 million for the year that ended sept 30 and the deficit 
could be at least as high this year 
budget officials predict dixon could have difficulty meeting the 
city payroll in january or february which are traditionally 
lowrevenue months 
the city also appears well on its way to a new annual murder 
rate 
a total of 382 people had died on city streets through oct 29 
there were 438 murders in 1989 and police blame more than 60 
percent of the killings on drugs particularly turf battles among 
crack dealers 
and the city is haunted by an infant mortality rate higher than 
that of many impoverished nations a public school system that 
traditionally ranks among the worst in the country and a chronic 
jail crowding problem 
weve got to reinvest in this city every part of it said 
dixon who has pledged to extend economic opportunities to the 
citys poorest neighborhoods if we can do that we can begin to 
see some progress in other areas

republican craig james eked out a 
congressional victory two years ago by taking advantage of a 
defense procurement scandal that engulfed his opponent 10term 
incumbent bill chappell 
now james is in trouble faced with a strong challenge from 
democrat reid hughes in one of floridas nastiest congressional 
campaigns 
one of hughes campaign themes james acceptance of money from 
political action committees the same issue that james used against 
chappell in 1988 
hes james being financed by pac money which he campaigned 
against two years ago as unethical hughes charged 
there is nothing inappropriate about it replied james it 
is legal i never said i wouldnt take pac money 
and james has criticized hughes a millionaire for spending so 
much of his own money for the campaign 622100 to date 
he said he wouldnt spend his own money and he did said 
james i wouldnt be surprised if he didnt spend 1 million for 
the campaign 
hughes replied that a great deal of the money in his election 
effort is coming from small people this is a citizens campaign 
versus a specialinterest campaign 
the two have clashed over abortion and their environmental 
records 
james threatened to file a libel suit over one hughes ad 
both defend their negative campaign ads saying they merely 
point out their opponents record 
in our case we had to attack his very negative record said 
hughes he is an extremist not just on his voting record but 
for his offthewall nutty statements 
negative campaigning i dont mind as long as it is truthful 
james said we felt it especially important to point out he 
clais to be an environmentalist and he is not we felt it was 
necessary to bring out facts not flattering to mr hughes 
while hughes is prochoice on abortion james opposes abortion 
except in cases of rape incest or to save the life of the mother 
james said hes been misrepresented in hughes ads on his position 
hughes ads say he james said that pregnant women are too 
confused to make their own decisions whether or not to have an 
abortion 
but james said he merely said that pregnancy is a confusing time 
for women 
hughes is chairman of the nature conservancy which purchases 
land to prevent it from being developed he has been attacked by 
james in ads about leaking gasoline tanks at stations owned by 
hughes oil co which hughes sold three years ago 
james ads say hughes had to pay a milliondollar settlement 
after his string of gas stations leaked gasoline into our drinking 
water 
there is no record nor reality of any state federal local 
government or city fining me hughes said it is a lie what he 
is saying its a scare tactic by a desperate opponent 
hughes did pay 13 million to the buyers of gas station 
properties after leaking tanks were discovered but there is no 
evidence that the tanks polluted drinking water 
both candidates were not pleased with the budget compromise 
worked out in congress and say it hurts middleincome poor and 
elderly floridians 
whatever the outcome of tuesdays election the results cant be 
much closer than when james a virtually unknown republican 
defeated chappell by 791 votes out of 250000 cast 
i think it will be close but i hope its not that close 
james said 
each candidate says he is leading in a close race

sen bob kerrey says he hopes that talk of 
invading kuwait is nothing more than political rhetoric by 
president bush 
bush doesnt want to talk about the budget or other domestic 
issues because they are tough issues and they are not winning 
political issues at this time kerrey said friday 
military action is not needed said kerrey who won the medal of 
honor for his service during the vietnam war 
to plunge unilaterally into military action is a terrible and 
tragic mistake it should not be done the nebraska democrat 
said 
he said it is wrong to view the middle east crisis as a conflict 
between iraq and the united states 
if the president makes the mistake of getting americans all 
fired up because of the treatment of american hostages it then 
becomes an issue between iraqi president saddam hussein and the 
united states which almost has to be treated with a military 
effort kerrey said

responsible government source and distributed by the official 
saudi press agency 
londonbased amnesty reported thursday that yemenis were being 
rounded up expelled and illtreated for no apparent reason other 
than their nationality or their suspected opposition to the saudi 
arabian governments position in the gulf crisis 
the human rights group claimed to have interviewed yemenis who 
had torture marks including a man beaten so badly he had to be 
hospitalized it called on king fahd to hold an immediate public 
inquiry 
about 750000 out of some 2 million yemeni workers in the 
kingdom have left since riyadh announced sept 18 it was annulling 
their residence and work privileges the decision was in apparent 
retaliation for yemeni support of iraq in the gulf crisis 
saudi arabia initially offered yemenis a month to find a saudi 
sponsor but the deadline has been extended in line with the rules 
for all other expatriate workers 
the saudi statement said hundreds of thousands of yemenis are 
pursuing their activities in the kingdom supported by all saudi 
care after having adjusted their status 
those who left after the new ruling have done so of their own 
free will and have taken with them all that they made of money and 
possessions it said 
the statement said amnesty had probably contacted the more 
than 70000 yemenis who were expelled from kuwait and iraq and 
crossed through the kingdom to yemen with nothing for a cover on 
their bodies and who found all care with the saudi authorities 
perhaps it is these that the yemeni authorities seeking to 
harm us presented to amnesty international the statement said

an american team plans to leave for israel 
soon to finalize transfer of 400 million in guarantees to finance 
housing for a tide of soviet jews flowing into the country 
officials say 
the decision to send the team disclosed friday by israeli 
ambassador zalman shoval after a meeting with secretary of state 
james a baker ends a dispute that contributed to strained 
relations between the two countries 
americans have been calling on israel to refrain from using the 
us guarantees to build houses in the predominantly arab eastern 
part of jerusalem which was captured from jordan in the 1967 
mideast war 
shoval said israel would not use us guarantees to build homes 
in the eastern part of jerusalem but would use its own money to 
build wherever it wanted there are no two cities of jerusalem 
just as there are no two cities of berlin he said 
israels arab neighbors are incensed at the growing number of 
jewish homes being built in what they regard as occupied territory 
the bush administration has questioned several times recently 
israels right to the eastern part of the city an explosive issue 
that the reagan administration had refrained from raising 
the question arose this year partly as a result of the large 
influx of soviet jews under the newly liberalized emigration 
policies of soviet president mikhail gorbachev

concern in congress that pakistan may be 
trying to get nuclear weapons has brought a promise from the bush 
administration to take up the issue with that countrys new 
government 
we expect to engage the new pakistani government early on in 
discussion of these issues assistant secretary of state john 
kelly said friday 
he told a house panel military aid to pakistan has been 
suspended in compliance with a law requiring such a cutoff unless 
the administration can certify that the asian nation does not 
possess nuclear weapons 
the united states had planned 564 million in military aid for 
pakistan in the fiscal year that began oct 1 
chairman stephen solarz dny opened the hearing of the 
asiapacific subcommittee with a warning that neither the 
administration nor congress is prepared to turn a blind eye toward 
mounting evidence that pakistan persists in its pursuit of nuclear 
weaponry 
unless the new government takes steps to prove that it does not 
have those arms american law is quite clear no further us 
assistance can flow to pakistan solarz added

a federal court says the federal regulators 
went too far in trying to streamline licensing of future atomic 
power plants 
in its decision the us court of appeals for the district of 
columbia handed a victory to antinuclear groups that said the plan 
would muzzle public opinion on licensing of plants 
the threejudge panel was critical of a nuclear regulatory 
commission plan to allow operators to get both a construction and 
operating permit in a single proceeding violated the law 
the court said the one step plan would violate federal law 
the nrc issued its new licensing regulations last year as part 
of an attempt to simplify the licensing process and reduce 
uncertainties and delays the action immediately was challenged in 
court by the nuclear information and resource service and the union 
of concerned scientists 
its disappointing said nrc spokesman joe fouchard weve 
attempted to craft a rule which provides for early decision 
making 
the court did uphold some parts of the plan but it said the 
commission must hold a second round of hearings after construction 
is complete before an operating permit can be issued

only 10 months after the velvet 
revolution ousted the communists and swept civic forum to power 
the movement founded by president vaclav havel is in crisis over 
the speed of reform 
cracks began to appear in the broad political movement earlier 
this month when finance minister vaclav klaus a radical 
freemarket reformer was elected civic forum chairman over martin 
palous 
palous was backed by the organizations prague leadership and by 
havel who favors slower gentler reform that will be less of a 
shock to the population 
klaus victory oct 13 was seen as a dramatic shift to the right 
and it triggered an identity crisis in civic forum founded on a 
civic rights platform and popularly associated with havels 
liberal humanistic philosophy 
on thursday obroda a group of leftwing intellectuals and 
marxist reformers quit civic forum to protest the forum executive 
councils decision to expel another group of noncommunist 
leftists the left alternative 
the changes are reminiscent of the splintering of polands 
solidarity which was unified in its opposition to communist rule 
but since gaining power has divided into factions led by prime 
minister tadeusz mazowiecki and the more conservative lech walesa 
in a recent interview with the leading lidove noviny newspaper 
klaus suggested that civic forums splintering might be inevitable 
he said the idea of citizens groups forming the basis for 
politics is as impracticable to me as the idea of a centrally 
planned economy 
obroda and left alternative headed by former dissident petr 
uhl issued a joint statement that called the expulsion 
illegitimate undemocratic and an outrage 
its over there is no way to go on like this one of the 
executive councils 15 members said thursday speaking on condition 
of anonymity when people excommunicate their political rivals 
without hearing the other side there is very little to talk 
about 
more conservative forum members say the rightward shift is a 
natural political development as czechoslovakia starts grappling 
with social and economic woes left by communism 
after we have finally defeated the communists in free 
elections the question was no longer what we were against but what 
we were for said said daniel kroupa a parliamentary deputy and 
leader of the forums rightwing faction 
klaus wants radical reform in the inefficient economy which 
most people say will bring higher prices and unemployment to the 
countrys 155 million people havel favors a more careful course 
popular support for civic forum during the popular revolution of 
last novemberdecember and its subsequent triumph in june 
elections swept many of the groups veteran dissidents into high 
political office 
leaders such as havel foreign minister jiri dienstbier and 
czech premier petr pithart were too busy with state affairs for the 
most part to concern themselves with civic forum debates and it 
drifted to the right 
klaus although always considered a committed anticommunist 
was never seen as a dissident 
conservative forum deputies have founded the interparliamentary 
club of the democratic right grouping 42 of the movements 116 
deputies in the 300seat bicameral parliament 
thirtysix mostly leftwing forum deputies formed the 
interparliamentary civic society 
in a race to lead the civic forum delegation in parliament 
kroupa won 57 votes edging out leftist petr kucera with 46 since 
neither secured the 59 votes needed to clinch the leadership a 
compromise candidate is being sought 
civic forums smaller counterpart in the slovak republic public 
against violence has been under attack in recent months but has 
had no major internal conflicts

inside the interior department they refer 
to it as the cow pie case and frankly they think it stinks 
but if the agency loses a case that a federal judge has ordered 
to trial it soon may have to determine whether flatulent sheep 
cattle and buffalo are contributing to global warming 
the washingtonbased foundation on economic trends filed a 
lawsuit last year accusing the federal agriculture interior and 
energy departments of failing to measure how much flatulent 
livestock are contributing to global warming by pumping methane gas 
into the atmosphere 
it is basically known as the cow pie case said the interior 
departments top lawyer tom sansonetti 
sansonetti is taking the fragrant fracas seriously especially 
after losing an early round in court he has assigned a lawyer to 
the case fulltime 
we filed a motion to dismiss and we lost its going to go 
to full trial on this issue he told the wyoming stock growers 
association and wyoming wool growers association on friday i 
couldnt believe it 
the foundation alleges that flatulent livestock could be 
producing up to 15 percent of atmospheric methane believed by some 
scientists to be a contributing factor to global warming 
scientists believe global warming also known as the greenhouse 
effect occurs when the layer of carbon dioxide and other gases 
accumulating above the earth prevents the atmosphere from cooling 
scientists say it can lead to potentially catastrophic climate 
changes that can cause polar ice melting a rise in the worlds 
oceans and drought conditions 
if the foundations lawsuit is successful sansonetti said the 
interior departments bureau of land management would have to 
determine how much methane is generated by livestock grazing on 
public lands 
his office has until nov 15 to file an answer to the lawsuit 
arguing why such a study shouldnt be conducted 
if a study is undertaken and it finds that the animals are 
indeed releasing too much methane sansonetti said farmers might be 
asked to produce less windy cattle 
one way to do that he said in an interview would be to change 
the animals feed 
another alternative would be to reduce the number of animals 
allowed to graze on public land

the governing party has won 36 of 38 
races in northern coahuila state mayoral elections which 
opposition parties have challenged with claims of widespread fraud 
the elections which were held sunday touched off several 
protests this week governing party supporters temporarily blocked 
the international bridge between ciudad acuna and del rio texas 
on wednesday night 
in the official results announced friday the coahuila states 
election commission said governing institutional revolutionary 
party or pri had won in all cities except the state capital 
saltillo and ciudad acuna only 25 percent of eligible voters cast 
ballots it said 
the conservative national action party was declared the winner 
in saltillo the leftist cardenista front of national 
reconstruction was named the victor in ciudad acuna 
the pri previously held all 38 mayoralties 
the elections were the first since the pri announced political 
reform last month sundays voting was considered a preview of 
elections later this month in mexico state and 1991 midterm 
congressional elections 
several opposition groups have challenged sundays election 
results in 14 municipalities because of what they claim was 
largescale fraud the pri also claimed opposition fraud 
challenging the results in the two cities where it lost 
the state electoral tribunal has 15 days to decide whether the 
protests are valid if it finds they are the state congress 
decides whether to call new polls 
opposition parties claim that many registered voters were not 
allowed to cast ballots because their names had been erased from 
the voter rolls they say some pri members were listed more than 
once at different voting booths allowing the party to conduct a 
carousel in which sympathizers voted in several polling places 
they also claim the pri bought votes in many cities with money 
or goods 
the pri made similar charges against the opposition it has 
filed challenges to results in saltillo and ciudad acuna according 
to election officials 
in a protest this week over the elections members of the 
democratic revolutionary party marched in torreon and destroyed two 
cars 
in another demonstration about 100 members of the authentic 
party of the mexican revolution briefly occupied the municipal 
palace in ramos arizpe 
the pri has remained in power since itsfoundation in 1929 in 
part by suppressing or buying off the opposition stuffing ballot 
boxes and rigging election results 
however president carlos salinas de gortari has been pushing 
political reform as well as economic modernization he took office 
in 1988 after winning little more than 50 percent of the vote the 
smallest percentage in the partys history

the national endowment for the arts advisory 
council is recommending grants for two controversial stage 
performers who figured in the dispute over antiobscenity rules 
congress sought to impose on the agency 
i will make my decision as quickly as possible nea chairman 
john e frohnmayer said friday after the vote to provide grants to 
two avantgarde new york theaters for performances by karen finley 
and holly hughes 
the councils recommendation is advisory the final decision 
rests with frohnmayer 
grant applications submitted previously by miss finley and miss 
hughes as well as fellow performers john fleck and tim miller of 
los angeles were rejected by frohnmayer he said their work would 
not enhance public understanding and appreciation of the arts 
the four performers sued frohnmayer and the endowment in federal 
court in los angeles they charged their freespeech rights had 
been violated because funds were denied on political rather than 
artistic grounds 
frohnmayer was under pressure from conservative lawmakers to 
halt federal support for what they consider obscene and blasphemous 
artistic projects some critics have cited the neas previous 
grants to miss finley and miss hughes as evidence of a willingness 
to support objectionable works 
performance artists stage monologues and musical acts that 
frequently deal with feminism racism political issues and 
homosexual concerns sometimes in sexually explicit terms 
the new grant applications are for performances by miss finley 
at the kitchen theater and miss hughes at the downtown art company 
both of new york they had been unanimously approved by an nea 
peer panel of outside artists and arts managers 
the council deferred action last august on five grant requests 
including those from finley and hughes citing a possible conflict 
of interest involving artistic collaborators who served on the peer 
panel 
later a fresh panel was formed it also approved the five 
grants the amounts were not disclosed but kitchen theater 
executive director barbara tsumagari said her request totaled 
25000 
its definitely not over until john frohnmayer makes the final 
decision miss finley said after the council vote 
before adjourning last weekend congress approved a 174 million 
nea budget that scrapped an explicit obscenity ban effective oct 
1 the measure must be signed by president bush before it becomes 
law 
the ban was imposed a year ago at the urging of sen jesse 
helms rnc and his allies who expressed outrage at endowment 
support for exhibitions of controversial works by the late 
photographer robert mapplethorpe and artist andres serrano 
last weekend congress voted to repeal the ban and instead to 
penalize nea grant recipients whose works are later ruled obscene 
by the courts the measure provides only that obscenity shall not 
be funded and that grant decisions must take into account 
general standards of decency and respect for the public beliefs 
and values 
council member nina brock a former member of the tennessee arts 
commission and a chattanooga arts patron abstained on the 
councils voice vote friday she earlier had questioned whether 
miss hughes work met endowment standards for artistic excellence

irish parliamentarians traveled to iraq on friday to try to win the

fifty years ago they ran away from 
galloping gertie when the tacoma narrows bridge collapsed in 
the worst bridge failure in history 
on sunday theyll mark the anniversary by running toward and 
on the suspension spans successor 
on nov 7 1940 the milelong bridge linking tacoma and the 
kitsap peninsula fell into puget sound the 4monthold bridge 
which got its nickname from its instability in high winds had 
twisted and buckled for an hour in a gale then its 2800foot 
center span crashed into the water 190 feet below 
the only fatality was a cocker spaniel too frightened to leave 
the bridge 
tacoma wouldnt get a replacement span for another 10 years but 
it was worth the wait state officials say the new one hasnt 
developed any serious problems 
its really in excellent shape said bob george state 
bridge management engineer 
the successor bridge will be the site of a 10kilometer 
footrace a threemile walk and an antique car parade sunday as 
tacoma commemorates galloping gerties collapse 
the first narrows bridge was the thirdlargest suspension span 
in the world when it opened july 1 1940 almost immediately it 
gained a reputation for swaying in the winds that channel through 
the passage that forms the entrance to southern puget sound 
the bridge was designed by leon moiseiff who also designed the 
golden gate and san francisco bay bridges but george said the 
narrows bridge was quite a departure from previous suspension 
bridge designs 
for one thing he said it was narrow just 33 feet and two 
lanes wide it also had solid sides and a solid deck which george 
said gave it the aerodynamic characteristics of kite 
the bridge roadbed would move in a wavelike motion old films 
show cars disappearing in a wave trough and reappearing moments 
later as the trough turns into a crest 
on the day the bridge fell the late leonard coatsworth a 
tacoma news tribune reporter was driving across it with his 
daughters dog tubby 
in an article published later that day he described how the 
swaying became so severe that he had to abandon his car the 
frightened dog refused to follow as coatsworth walked and crawled 
to the buckling bridges east tower 
eyewitnesses described broken support cables cracking like whips 
and concrete bursting from the roadbed like popcorn 
the last person off the bridge was howard clifford then a 
photographer for the news tribune who had been sent out with 
reporter bert brintnal to cover the catastrophe 
in an article published thursday by the newspapers successor 
the morning news tribune clifford told how he and brintnal heard 
sounds like rifle shots as support cables snapped they were 
standing on the bridges eastern section when the center collapsed 
suddenly the center section of the bridge gave a mighty heave 
and peeled back as it fell into the waters below clifford wrote 
fearing that the east section might also fall bert and i turned 
and ran for the toll plaza 
the 6 million failure was replaced by an 18 million fourlane 
span that opened in october 1950 
it was radically different the roadbed rested on trusses that 
had been tested in wind tunnels the bridge deck 60feet wide 
between the trusses had gratings between the lanes to let air flow 
through at each of the two towers and at the center of the span 
are hydraulic shock absorbers to dampen any movement 
theres no way youre going to let a second one go down 
george said if anything when this bridge was designed im sure 
it was ultra ultra conservative 
scuba divers meanwhile are trying to get galloping gerties 
remains declared a federal and state historical landmark to protect 
it from salvagers who are taking pieces of it for scrap metal 
jacques cousteau has even made dives at the tacoma narrows 
bridge its probably the finest dive in the northwest in terms of 
variety of sea life and clarity of water diver bob mester said 
jake thomas the states historical officer said the sunken 
bridge is worthy of consideration and wouldnt be the first 
underwater site protected 
to qualify the structure must be of historical or 
archaeological significance and at least 50 years old

ousted prime minister benazir bhutto 
and her party walked out of the new parliament today after her 
jailed husband was not allowed to attend the swearingin ceremony 
the rightwing islamic democratic alliance which routed ms 
bhutto in last months election took the oath without them to form 
pakistans fifth civilian government 
dozens of police wielding batons surrounded the national 
assembly building and forced bhutto supporters across a treelined 
boulevard 
ms bhutto initially rejected demands to boycott the opening 
session of the national assembly the lawmaking lower house of 
parliament but she walked out after her husband asif ali zardari 
did not show up for the ceremony 
interior minister zahid safraz said adequate security 
arrangements could not be made to bring zardari from jail in the 
southern port city of karachi to the pakistani capital 
zardari won a legislative seat representing the sprawling 
karachi slum of lyari in the oct 24 elections he has been in jail 
since oct 10 on extortion charges 
earlier this week a judge ordered that zardari be allowed to 
take his parliamentary oath 
safraz said the availability of security personnel in karachi 
was limited because of weeklong demonstrations against the 
desecration of a moslem mosque by hindu fundamentalists in 
neighboring india the demonstrations have been peaceful and 
sparsely attended 
parliament speaker malik miraj khalid ordered the minister to 
bring zardari to islamabad for sundays legislative session 
zardari 38 has been blamed for many of ms bhuttos troubles 
since her government was ousted aug 6 on corruption charges he 
regularly came under fire during her 20 months in power for 
allegedly demanding commissions on lucrative government contracts 
ms bhutto and zardari have steadfastly denied any wrongdoing 
her populist pakistan peoples party suffered a stunning defeat 
in last months national elections which brought the rightwing 
alliance to power 
she has accused her opponents of massive vote fraud the claims 
have not been substantiated 
it appears that nawaz sharif 41 will be the next prime 
minister he was the alliances unanimous choice for the post 
which will be decided by secret ballot in the assembly next week 
sharifs alliance swept the national elections winning 105 
seats in the 217seat assembly he also claims the loyalty of 
another 40 seats controlled by independents and smaller parties 
ms bhuttos peoples party and three allied groups won only 45 
seats

public places do not provide adequate restroom facilities for 
women who generally take longer to go to the bathroom than men

in a major bid to clean up the worlds oceans 
delegates from the united states and 42 other nations have agreed 
to bar dumping industrial waste at sea within five years 
environmental groups praised the actions taken by delegates at 
the fiveday meeting of the london dumping convention which ended 
friday 
it is not an exaggeration to say that this is an historic step 
in cleaning up the sea said remi parmentier of the environmental 
group greenpeace 
on thursday the delegates adopted by consensus a resolution 
that calls for phasing out industrial waste dumping at sea by 1995 
it is legally binding on all 64 nations that have signed the 
20yearold london dumping convention they include the united 
states britain germany france the soviet union japan and most 
other industrialized nations 
the united states which in 1988 passed a law halting ocean 
dumping of industrial waste had originally opposed the 
international ban saying more study was needed 
but they realized there was such strong sentiment against 
dumping that it was pointless to obstruct it and they just gave 
up parmentier said 
the resolution was sponsored by denmark iceland finland 
norway sweden spain and brazil 
under the measure a survey will be conducted to identify areas 
suffering the worst effects of waste dumping member countries will 
be expected to prosecute their own flagships found violating the 
ban 
the resolution calls for dumping to be stopped without 
increasing pollution in other parts of the environment 
the measure urges nations to encourage and promote cleaner 
industrial processes recycling the treatment of waste on land and 
more research and development on alternative and environmentally 
sound means of waste disposal 
delegates also recommended creation of a global mechanism for 
controlling landbased pollution of the sea 
about 80 percent of all ocean pollution is generated on land 10 
percent comes from industrial waste disposed of by ships at sea 
and the rest is thrown or discharged from vessels in routine 
operations 
delegates also agreed that the dumping convention should be 
applied to the burial of radioactive waste under the sea floor the 
resolution though not binding was a setback for plans for seabed 
disposal of highlevel nuclear waste 
the united states britain france and soviet union all with 
active nuclear programs voted against the resolution but 
indicated they would voluntarily comply japan belgium 
switzerland and greece abstained from voting 
this vote sends a strong message to the world that the sea 
disposal of radioactive waste is not acceptable parmentier said 
disposing of the lethal waste is a major headache for 
governments and the nuclear industry local groups often have 
blocked construction of landbased nuclear dumps 
weve all got radioactive waste that has to be disposed of 
and it either goes to the sea or to the land said a british 
delegate speaking on condition of anonymity 
wherever you go someone will be very annoyed but you cant 
wish it away

after nine months of gossip about the war 
between the trumps ivana is filing for divorce from developer 
donald 
it wasnt clear however whether shell settle for their 
postnuptial financial agreement worth 22 million or keep seeking 
half of her husbands nowfaltering empire 
the trumps announced friday in statements that she is seeking 
the divorce 
they separated in february amid a flurry of publicity over 
donald trumps relationship with modelactress marla maples their 
marital troubles repeatedly made the front pages of the citys 
tabloid newspapers 
in march mrs trumps lawyers filed a lawsuit challenging the 
validity of a postnuptial agreement that granted her 10 million 
cash and the trumps 12 million connecticut estate in the event of 
divorce 
at the time michael kennedy a lawyer for mrs trump said the 
22 million represented less than 1 percent of thenbillionaire 
donalds assets he said mrs trump deserved half of her husbands 
empire 
but trump since has come under severe pressure from bondholders 
and other lenders and the worth of the former billionaire now is 
subject to question 
the postnuptial agreement mrs trump signed has become more 
attractive the developers lawyer jay goldberg suggested 
in the first lawsuit she claimed the agreement ought to be set 
aside goldberg said once the depositions were taken she 
realizes now the frivolousness of her position now she seeks a 
divorce where she can get the benefit of the agreement 
goldberg said mrs trumps lawsuit seeking to invalidate the 
agreement was still pending and he did not know what would happen 
to it 
kennedys secretary said friday he would not speak to reporters

charles keating jr sold risky junk bonds for 
his lincoln savings and loan association even after he told a 
federal regulator the thrift stood to lose 2 billion the 
regulator told a grand jury 
if this institution is taken over you guys will be faced with 
a 2 billion loss the official alex barabolak quoted keating 
as telling him in october 1988 according to transcripts of grand 
jury testimony released friday 
barabolak is an examiner with the federal office of thrift 
supervision and a former examiner with the federal home loan bank 
board 
prosecutors have charged that keating knew lincoln couldnt back 
the uninsured bonds but misled the public into buying the bonds 
from lincoln and its parent american continental corp 
keating has insisted he didnt know lincoln was in trouble until 
american continental filed for bankruptcy in april 1989 lincoln 
was taken over by regulators the next day it will cost taxpayers 
an estimated 2 billion to bail out the thrift 
we think we will demonstrate that we didnt violate any 
laws said keatings attorney stephen c neal and theres 
nothing in the transcripts that changes my belief 
a 42count indictment accuses keating and three associates of 
securities fraud in the junk bond sales 
keating 66 pleaded innocent and is free on 300000 bail after 
spending a month in jail in los angeles his associates also 
pleaded innocent and posted bail 
keating is charged with ordering employees to steer depositors 
away from insured certificates of deposit in favor of the uninsured 
junk bonds the proceeds were used to fund real estate ventures 
all told 17458 investors lost more than 250 million 
prosecutors said the indictment listed only 20 victims who lost 
11 million as prosecutors said they wanted a concise case 
a judge unsealed 45 volumes of grand jury testimony friday at 
the request of the news media 
the transcripts showed that sen alan cranston dcalif one of 
the socalled keating five five us senators who accepted 
13 million in political contributions from keating avoided 
testifying before the grand jury he pleaded a busy schedule 
cranston maintains he was unaware of the severity of lincolns 
problems at the time he spoke to thrift regulators on keatings 
behalf he says he was merely trying to cut red tape for a 
substantial california employer 
the senate ethics committee is investigating whether the five 
senators improperly intervened with regulators on the arizona 
developers behalf 
in other testimony an 83yearold widow described how she was 
lured into plunging her life savings into the bonds adaliza 
whinfield said she lost 50000 on bonds purchased at the lincoln 
branch in hemet calif a retirement community in the desert 100 
miles east of los angeles 
mrs whinfield said an investment counselor named robert pascual 
told her the bonds were as safe as the united states of 
america

african olympic organizers in their 
first meeting with south african sports officials today refused to 
drop their sports boycott against south africa despite the 
whiteled pretoria governments racial reforms 
but africas main olympic policymaking body also said at the 
beginning of the twoday meeting that it looks forward to 
readmission of south african sportsmen to international events in 
the fairly near future 
zimbabwean officials have said the south africans will be told 
specifically during the meeting what they must do to end the 
boycott in time for the 1996 olympics in atlanta 
we shall not give up until south african leaders accept that 
in sport all men are equal whatever the color of their skin 
jean claude ganga of the congo president of the association of 
national olympic committees of africa said at the opening session 
south africa has done away with part of its apartheid system of 
racial separation in the past year 
but the boycott imposed by the international olympic committee 
in 1970 will not be lifted until apartheid is dismantled entirely 
and south africa merges white and black sports groups into one 
national olympic committee ganga said 
the meeting marked the first time south african sports officials 
conferred facetoface with their black african counterparts to 
discuss what ganga called south africas return to that most 
peaceful of battlegrounds the sports ground 
about 40 south african sports organizers attended the meeting to 
lobby for an end to the international sports boycott imposed by the 
international olympic committee in 1970 
the south africans argue that reforms introduced by president f 
w de klerk have improved their countrys image enough to clear the 
way for a phased lifting of the boycott 
african olympic officials however say the dismantling of 
apartheid and steps toward a negotiated settlement between the 
whitedominated government and the voteless black majority must 
make more progress before the ban can be eased 
the south african delegates represent all major sports in that 
country they include danie craven longtime president of the south 
african rugby board heads of the whitedominated national cricket 
union and leaders of the mainly black olympic sports committee 
despite bans in the past some south african golfers tennis 
competitors and other individual players have taken part in 
international events 
there have also been unofficial and widely condemned tours to 
south africa particularly by cricket and rugby teams

mikhail gorbachev is urging restraint 
after moldavian troops shot russians and ukrainians in ethnic 
strife that could jeopardize the soviet presidents efforts to hold 
the nation together 
officials in moldavia said at least three people were killed and 
nine wounded in one clash friday east of kishinev capital of the 
southwestern soviet republic 
moldavian authorities declared states of emergency in three 
cities in the east where separatists have declared their own 
republic separatists declared a state of mourning and flags there 
were flying halfmast the official soviet news agency tass 
reported 
the separatist authorities also met to consider an economic 
boycott of kishinev such as cutting off electricity supplies and 
railway traffic tass said 
the violence friday came after russian and ukrainian separatists 
seized a government building in dubossary set up roadblocks and 
announced elections for an independent parliament according to 
legislators in kishinev 
the parliament in moldavia a republic of 43 million people 
bordering romania announced formation of a new national guard to 
try to reestablish order in the area east of the dniester river 
but deputy mayor alexander parajan of dubossary said the 
dniester separatists demand the introduction of soviet interior 
ministry troops instead of kishinev militia or volunteer units 
tass reported 
pyotr shornikov a member of the moldavian parliament said 
states of emergency were declared in the cities of dubossary 
tiraspol and bendery 
president gorbachev met with the moldavian president in moscow 
friday during a conference of 15 republic leaders and called for 
restraint 
the most important thing is the inviolability of moldavias 
borders and its territorial integrity gorbachev said in an 
interview on the nightly newscast vremya we should struggle 
against separatists of all kinds 
gorbachev trying to carry out political and economic reform is 
beset by restive republics demanding greater autonomy or even 
independence all but one of the 15 republics have declared some 
form of sovereignty 
moldavia declared sovereignty last june and is trying to 
separate from the soviet union but it faces its own crisis 
produced by two internal separatist movements 
the gagauz another minority composed of turkish christians 
declared sovereignty last week in southern moldavia and the 
legislature declared a state of emergency in the gagauz area 
both separatist groups complain that moldavians discriminate 
against minorities 
the unrest began more than a year ago after the moldavian 
parliament declared moldavian the republics national language 
nonmoldavians feared discrimination and loss of their own culture 
as moldavian nationalism grew 
yuri roshka a moldavian peoples front leader who supports 
moldavian independence alleged the separatist movements were being 
directed by the kremlin to try to discredit and stop the republics 
independence drive 
he declared the soviet empire has always used the tactic 
divide and conquer and thats what theyre trying to do here 
dubossary a town containing more than 20000 people lies in a 
heavily slavic area northeast of kishinev along the dniester river 
more than 200000 russian and ukrainian speakers live in the area 
the moldavian interior ministry said the fighting took place 
about 5 pm friday at the west end of a bridge over the river that 
had been blocked by russian and ukrainian volunteers 
from 100 to 200 russian and ukrainian volunteers erected a road 
block on the bridge and other roads leading to their selfdeclared 
dniester republic after hearing rumors that moldavians were headed 
there to try to stop the independence movement it reported 
the ministrys lt col yevgeny v zaporozov said 100 to 200 
ministry troops fired after separatists hurled stones sticks and 
other missiles from behind a barricade on the bridge 
zaporozov said hospital officials in dubossary told him gunfire 
killed three people and wounded nine 
the news agency tass reported earlier that six people were 
killed in fighting between dubossary and lunga village but gave no 
details the discrepancy was not immediately clarified 
zaporozov said all the casualties were russian or ukrainian 
volunteers 
the approximately 400 interior ministry troops sent from 
kishinev also recaptured the government building in dubossary 
parliamentary officials said 
russians and ukrainians from the area had helped defend the 
gagauz from moldavian nationalist volunteer who tried to stop the 
gagauz secession last week the kremlin sent up to 800 interior 
ministry troops to keep order in the gagauz areas

security above all he said

possibility of jackson bringing the two sides together to resolve 
the strike 
lawyer theodore kheel an adviser to the newspapers nine 
striking unions said labor was interested in having jackson 
mediate an issue common to all of the unions the right of 
strikers to return to their jobs the daily news has replaced some 
strikers who wouldnt cross picket lines

officials of six warsaw pact countries 
signed an agreement today dividing up tanks artillery aircraft 
and other conventional weapons 
the accord removes the last serious obstacle to the nov 19 
signing of a conventional arms treaty by the us canada and all 
european nations except albania in paris on nov 19 president bush 
had said his presence was contingent on the conventional weapons 
treaty being ready for signing 
the meeting also comes at a time that the future of the 
sovietled bloc is in question as members strengthen ties with the 
west 
the signing of the agreement was delayed by almost four hours as 
delegations continued to work out what hungarian foreign ministry 
spokesman janos herman called technical questions 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze did not come to 
budapest because of internal engagements herman said he did 
not elaborate but shevardnadze could have been forced to stay in 
moscow because of ethnic violence that erupted in soviet moldavia 
along the romanian border 
the soviet union was represented by deputy foreign minister yuli 
kvitsinsky the foreign ministers of bulgaria hungary poland and 
romania were present czechoslovakia was represented by deputy 
foreign minister robert harenciar 
warsaw pact experts agreed last weekend in prague on how to 
divide the 20000 tanks and other conventional weapons they may 
keep under the agreement between east and west 
the nato alliance will be allowed to keep similar levels of 
weapons but will have to destroy many fewer than the warsaw pact 
members 
czechoslovak officials said after last weeks meeting that the 
soviets will keep 13150 tanks 150 fewer than they had proposed to 
keep 
a hungarian official recently revealed that the military 
aspect of the warsaw pact would be suspended in december and the 
pact would be dissolved as a military alliance next year 
continuing only as a political body 
hungary has already served notice that it will leave the 
military part of the pact next year even if it is not dissolved by 
then 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel said recently the pact would 
be transformed into a body with a consultative political 
function 
the warsaw pact was reduced to six members after east germany 
left the alliance prior to german unification last month

fishermen drove hundreds of dolphins toward shore 
on an island in southern japan on saturday causing the deaths of 
more than 100 officials said 
fishermen discovered thousands of dolphins swimming friday night 
in waters off miiraku on fukuejima island 630 miles southwest of 
tokyo an official of the miiraku fisheries cooperative said 
he said dozens of fishermen drove the dolphins toward the sandy 
beach using ropes in hopes of killing some for food but more than 
expected were trapped by the receding tide and were beached he 
said 
at least 100 died on the beach but another 200 returned to open 
waters said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
television showed dozens of dolphin bodies on the beach some 
thrashing their tails with dozens more swimming in nearby shallow 
waters 
the official said fishermen and local people had taken most of 
the dead dolphins home to eat many people here like to eat 
dolphin meat he said 
some owners of shops selling fish offered from 15 to 23 cents 
for each dolphin he said 
the fishery cooperative official said catching and eating 
dolphins should be no problem because there is no law 
prohibiting the practice he said a much smaller number of dolphins 
were killed by the villagers last year 
dolphins are used as a source of protein by the local people 
because fish and meat is expensive in the isolated community kyodo 
news service reported 
animal protection groups overseas have criticized the japanese 
custom as cruel and barbarian 
we know it is a controversial issue but for fishermen here 
dolphins are enemies because dolphins eat squid and other small 
fish the official said 
in february 1978 when fishermen in iki another fishing town in 
the area killed about 1000 dolphins caught off the island 
protesters poured into the town

the deficitreduction bill awaiting president 
bushs signature will cost the average family of four 321 a year 
with additional taxes spread close to evenly among the states a 
new analysis shows 
the average increase will range from 151 per family in west 
virginia to 578 in connecticut according to computations by 
citizens for tax justice a laborfinanced research group 
the changes will take an average 06 percent of family income on 
a national basis the report said the bite on family income will 
be within onetenth of a percentage point of the national average 
in every state except connecticut 08 percent and west virginia 
04 percent 
generally states with the highest incomes will face slightly 
higherthanaverage tax hikes as a share of income while those 
with the lowest average incomes will pay the least in additional 
taxes the report said 
this reflects the fact that overall the tax hikes are 
somewhat progressive meaning they fall most heavily on those 
most able to pay the organization said 
on a national basis the median tax increase will be 183 
meaning that half the fourmember families will see tax increases 
of less than 183 and half will see increases of more the highest 
median increase 250 will be in alaska the lowest 152 in 
pennsylvania the median increase differs from the average 
increase which is calculated by dividing all new taxes by all 
taxpaying families 
the bill which would cut the deficit by nearly 500 billion 
over the next five years includes 137 billion in tax increases 
these include higher taxes on gasoline tobacco alcoholic 
beverages airline tickets telephone service and expensive cars 
and other luxuries in addition the plan will raise medicare 
payroll taxes on people whose wages exceed 51300 and income taxes 
on those with incomes generally above the 100000ayear range 
meanwhile the organization representing state lawmakers said 
the deficitreduction plan will cost the states 169 billion over 
the next five years 
once again congressional and administration budget 
negotiators have taken the easy way out by exporting difficult 
decisions to the states the national conference of state 
legislatures said in a statement 
many states face severe recessionary and nogrowth economic 
conditions said the statement from lee daniels minority leader 
of the illinois house of representatives and john martin speaker 
of the maine house of representatives knowing this washington 
now decides to invade state revenue bases and at the same time tell 
states they need to find billions of additional dollars 
the biggest portion of the 169 billion 101 billion will 
come from provisions mandating social security coverage for all 
state and local government employees and raising the amount of 
wages that are subject to the medicare tax employers including 
governments must match employee taxes for social security and 
medicare 
other costs will include 36 billion in lost state revenue 
because of the higher taxes on gasoline tobacco and alcoholic 
beverages and 32 billion that the states will have to spend to 
meet federal regulations for medicare and medicaid services

in the 11th floor disco of baghdads 
mansour melia hotel overlooking the palmfringed tigris river two 
american and british diplomats sip beer and cokes as they wait to 
meet saddam husseins guests 
under the watchful eyes of iraqi intelligence agents a line of 
foreign men some emaciated and sick sit one by one at the tables 
pleasantries are exchanged the diplomats offer chocolates and 
hand over letters from some of the mens families 
the chocolates are consumed quickly and then the diplomats pass 
on which names they have submitted to the iraqi government for 
release on grounds of age or poor health which hostages they 
believe are to be used as saddam husseins human shields 
sometimes the hostages themselves know theyve been selected by 
the iraqis to be sent to strategic locations throughout iraq to 
deter any usled air attacks on those targets 
there is agony in their eyes but smiles of relief flutter 
fleetingly on the faces of those who have not been chosen and have 
a faint chance of being freed 
according to information gathered by western diplomats and other 
sources there were nearly 600 americans britons japanese or 
germans held at various strategic locations 
about 300 frenchmen held as human shields were allowed to leave 
iraq last week the french release was an apparent iraqi effort to 
encourage france to pressure washington and its allies to find a 
peaceful settlement to the persian gulf crisis prompted by the aug 
2 invasion of kuwait 
the luxurious 320room mansour melia in baghdads salhiya 
district was built by a spanish company specially to accommodate 
heads of state slated to attend the 1982 summit of the nonaligned 
movement 
but iraq was then at war with iran and the summit was eventually 
held in new delhi after tehran objected to the baghdad venue 
the hotel has now become the great hostage bazaar for 
saddams government diplomats say they also call it the hostage 
palace 
the logic behind the human shield operation is starkly simple 
the hostages die if the multinational force in the gulf launches 
air strikes on iraq 
the place is shockingly depressing said american diplomat 
stephen thibeault who is allowed to visit the mansour twice a day 
to see us hostages its a hostage manufacturing unit 
the day some of the hostages are released and allowed to go 
home the rooms are immediately restocked with others among the 
hundreds of foreigners held in baghdad he said 
most of the american hostages held at strategic sites passed 
through the hotel 
when britains former prime minister edward heath left for 
home oct24 with 33 britons whose freedom he had negotiated 26 
other britons were brought to the hotel within hours for shipping 
out to strategic sites 
those at the hotel waiting to be utilized as human shields are 
not allowed to leave the building or make telephone calls but they 
can swim in the hotel pool watched by iraqi guards 
they can eat from the hostage buffet thats laid out twice a 
day said another western diplomat on condition that neither he 
nor his nationality were mentioned 
in simple terms this place is nothing but a prison with the 
facilities of a hotel he added 
the mansour melia was chosen as a hostage center by the iraqis 
because it is situated between several important government 
buildings and security is tight 
at night lights around the hotel are kept on making it a 
sitting duck target in any air raid 
the idea is again simple youll kill your own men if you 
attack the diplomat said even a greenhorn pilot could pick 
the hotel as a nice target 
after the invasion of kuwait iraq banned foreigners from 
leaving the country instructing them to report to the police 
iraqis harboring foreigners were warned they could be hanged if 
they were caught 
the government then selected americans britons germans 
japanese and frenchmen as human shields 
hundreds of other foreigners including an estimated 300 
americans are in hiding in kuwait they are constantly being 
caught in ones and twos 
saddam has told the hostages that theyre being held because 
barring a person from seeing his homeland for a limited period of 
time is better for him and for humanity as a whole than denying 
thousands of people life itself in iraqa 
saddam also told his guests that they will be freed when 
the clouds roll by and the sky becomes clear again 
but there are no signs that the sky over the gulf is clearing

rebels seeking to overthrow the rwandan 
government denied reports in ugandan newspapers today that their 
leader is alive and being treated for battlefield injuries in the 
united states 
a statement from the rwandan patriotic front said rebel leader 
fred rwigyema died after stepping on a mine oct 2 the second day 
of the invasion 
rebel representatives in brussels said on condition of anonymity 
that the news of rwigyemas death was kept secret for fear of 
lowering the morale of the guerrillas 
but ugandan newspapers reported today that rwigyema was 
seriously wounded during a helicopter attack on rebel forces and 
was taken to the united states 
the newspapers quoting rwandan army commander lt col 
deogratius ndabimana did not describe rwigyemas injuries or say 
when or where he was injured the reports in the star and munno 
newspapers also did not say who evacuated rwigyema a former 
ugandan deputy army commander or where he was taken in the united 
states 
officials at the us embassy in kampala uganda could not be 
reached for comment 
in washington us officials said they could not confirm 
whether rwigyema was dead or alive but pointed out he had not been 
heard from since the beginning of the invasion they also denied 
on condition of anonymity that rwigyema had been brought to the 
united states for treatment 
the insurgents said rwigyema was killed in the northeastern 
region around kagitumba near the ugandan border the rebels have a 
base camp in the area 
the front also announced two other rebel leaders were killed by 
a land mine on oct 23 the statement did not say who was currently 
leading the insurgents 
the rebels said they still controlled the kagera national park 
in the north which makes up about 15 percent of rwandas 
territory despite government claims it had driven the insurgents 
out 
the front said it was ready to talk with the government about 
the future of rwanda a former belgian protectorate but the rebels 
warned they could still launch attacks 
last week the belgian government said it had negotiated a 
ceasefire between the government troops and the rebels but the 
truce has yet to become effective 
belgium and france sent paratroopers to rwanda to protect their 
nationals after the insurgency began belgiums last paratroopers 
returned saturday 
rwigyema who was 34 fled rwanda as a child during the 
repression of the tutsi tribe he returned to rwanda on oct 1 
leading a group of mostly tutsi refugees and deserters from 
ugandas army seeking to depose the government

the tax revolt and the environmental movement may be headed for 
jolts at the polls tuesday and anger at government could lead 
voters in two states to limit politicians terms 
polls conducted in the final days of this years campaign show 
roughly 21 support for ballot proposals in california and colorado 
aimed at limiting terms of state legislators colorados proposed 
amendment extends even to us senators and congressmen 
but the tide may be turning against big green a sweeping 
environmental issue in california as well as many of the antitax 
antispending measures facing voters in about a dozen states 
in several cases thats a switch from earlier poll results 
showing many such measures seemingly coasting toward approval 
in all voters in 43 states and the district of columbia will 
decide 236 ballot questions according to the free congress 
foundation a conservative washingtonbased research group that 
tracks propositions 
sixtyseven are citizen initiatives the most since 1914 when 
a record 90 appeared on state ballots twentysix states mostly in 
the west allow citizens to put initiatives on the ballot 
the changing fortunes of ballot races in several states have 
followed heavy campaigning by teachers unions local government 
officials and other affected interest groups and individuals 
their efforts appear to be paying off in massachusetts oregon 
and nebraska where early support for stringent antitax 
antispending issues seems to be waning 
analysts had interpreted the heavy volume of ballot measures as 
a sign of voter anger at politicsasusual but as election day 
approaches confusion prevails as voters try to sort out the 
consequences of the many ballot issues that promise sweeping 
solutions to complex problems 
nowhere is that truer than in california where earlier wide 
support for the highly complicated environmental proposition known 
as big green has dwindled according to polls the proposal is 
just one of 28 questions on californias ballot 
the outlook in key contests 
a tight race is apparently shaping up over californias 
proposition 128 which would impose severe limits or bans on 
pesticides offshore oil drilling and chemicals and emissions that 
harm the ozone layer environmental advocates still hope passage 
would give their cause a boost but a poll on friday found big 
green trailing slightly 
among other environmental contests missourians appear evenly 
split on a natural streams proposal aimed at protecting ozark 
waterways 
in massachusetts a proposed 2 billion state tax rollback is 
facing an uphill battle a poll for the boston globe and wbztv 
found 59 percent opposed to the rollback opponents of what would 
be the largest voterinitiated state tax cut in history argue it 
would bankrupt poor school districts seriously damage others and 
lead to tens of thousands of state layoffs 
a montana initiative which would junk the states existing 
tax system and replace it with a novel 1 percent trade charge 
on all sorts of transactions is trailing by a wide margin in 
opinion polls 
polls suggest a majority of utah voters may be heeding 
warnings of state college and school officials that a proposed 
repeal of the state sales tax on most food would be a disaster for 
education financing 
in nebraska the socalled 2 percent solution a 
proposition that would limit annual growth in state and local 
spending to 2 percent is likewise in trouble an oct 2426 poll 
published in the omaha worldherald found 57 percent of those 
surveyed opposed to the limit nebraskans also seem to be turning 
against a proposal to scrap a recently enacted school finance 
reform law that takes the burden from property tax by increasing 
state income and sales taxes 
in a contest being watched by the bush administration and 
education reformers oregon voters will decide on a farreaching 
school choice measure that would grant parents a 2500 tax 
credit to send their kids to any school even churchrelated or to 
teach them at home recent polls show the plan trailing 
a survey released wednesday indicated oregon voters narrowly 
favored two other tough measures one phasing in a 15 percent 
property tax limit and a second that would shut down the states 
only nuclear power plant 
in nevada 52 percent of those surveyed in an oct 21 poll 
supported a ballot issue aimed at making it harder to change the 
states liberal abortion law in oregon a proposed ban on 
abortions except in cases of rape and incest appears headed for 
defeated while a measure requiring parental notification for 
abortions performed on minors may pass 
equals

the rightwing coalition that ousted 
prime minister benzair bhutto is ready to revive the spread of 
islamic law and everthing from social mores to civil liberties may 
be affected 
islam has long been the center of cultural conflict between the 
westernized urban elite and islamic clerics who wield enormous 
influence over the impoverished conservative countryside where 
most of pakistans 110 million people live 
the last military dictator gen mohammad zia ulhaq championed 
islamic law during her 20 months in power however mrs bhutto 
was able to stave off attempts by religious fundamentalists to 
assert their influence over government and society 
with her dismissal from office and subsequent defeat in last 
months parliamentary elections the governing islamic democratic 
alliance is in a position to bring back strict islamic principles 
and has pledged to do so 
it has a parliamentary majority and probably will be able to 
draw on small parties for the twothirds majority needed to pass a 
bill imposing islamic law 
in islam the state and religion cannot be separated said 
zias eldest son ijaz ulhaq who won a parliament seat by 
promising to carry on his fathers islamic dream 
during his 11year rule gen zia made the islamization of 
pakistani society a pillar of his policy he was killed in a plane 
crash in august 1988 and ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party won 
elections held three months later 
her dismissal aug 6 charges of corruption and mismanagement 
renewed the debate of whether pakistan should be a secular 
democracy or governed by the laws of the koran the moslem holy 
book as interpreted by islamic scholars islamic law is 
interpreted with varying stringency from one moslem nation to 
another 
gen zias laws included a ban on consumption of alcohol 
flogging and stoning as punishments for such crimes as drinking and 
adultery and a 25 percent tax on the rich to help the poor they 
remain in effect but punishment by flogging is rare and there have 
been no stonings 
defining the relationship between islam and the countrys legal 
system has been a central question since 1947 when pakistan was 
created as a homeland for moslems in the partition of the indian 
subcontinent 
many islamic principles were enshrined in law before zia seized 
power in a a 1977 military coup he sought to expand these 
dramatically giving courts constitutional power to determine 
whether laws conformed to the koran and the traditions of the 
prophet mohammed 
when gen zia dismissed parliament in may 1988 he cited 
corruption laxity and failure to promote islamic law he issued a 
presidential order that decreed the legal code of islam to be the 
supreme law of pakistan and expanded court powers to review laws 
for conformity with the koran 
although special courts now review laws for compliance with 
islamic tradition final appeals still go to civil high courts 
rather than to legal bodies of religious scholars as in some 
moslem states 
that could change with the new government both critics and 
supporters say 
the bill will have smooth passage said zias son a 
38yearold useducated banker that is what islam is 
opponents contend the islamic biil would promote sectarianism 
pave the way for a militant and repressive theocracy confine women 
to their homes and ostracize them and bring the media and 
educational system under clerical control 
many groups particularly the middle class lawyers and educated 
women believe pakistan should not turn its back on western 
educational and legal traditions inherited from the british 
colonial era 
ms bhutto has tried to cloak herself in islamic traditions but 
also has spoken out strongly against zias brand of islamization 
the name is islam was used to practice oppression she said 
basic human rights were jeopardized under the new laws enacted as 
islamic laws 
earlier this year she infuriated the clerics by saying she 
opposed cutting off a hand as punishment for theft they called her 
an unbeliever and warned that anyone who said such things could be 
sentenced to death by religious leaders 
last week the leading islamic court ruled that punishment for 
defiling mohammeds name or teachings must be death

a pakistan native saddam said he is unfazed by sharing a name 
with the man president bush branded the butcher of baghdad

saddam he said i know hes not a nice person 
he is handling it all very well teacher patsy rogers said 
of the occasional ribbing saddam takes about his name he has a 
sense of humor 
saddam said he quickly got used to double takes and quizzical 
looks from teachers when school started a few weeks after iraq 
invaded kuwait aug 2 
they dont notice my name that much now he said 
our music teacher said that if the saddam hussein over there 
was as sweet as the saddam hussain over here we wouldnt have any 
problems said paige welborn one of saddams classmates i 
think shes right 
saddam is quick to point out a key difference between his name 
and the iraqi leaders he spells his last name with an e 
saddam said i spell mine with an a 
saddam got his name for two reasons his older brother is named 
hasham and the rhyming names sounded good for a pair of brothers 
his father manzoor hussain said adding 
in new york where i was working i had an iranian friend i 
would tell him im going to have a son and im going to name him 
saddam 
he said he was only teasing his iranian friend at that time in 
1980 iran and iraq were at war 
after we had a son i thought why not name him saddam its 
a good name said hussain a veterinarian for the us 
agriculture department in jackson 
most of saddams peers at pearl upper elementary understand a 
bit about events developing in the persian gulf rogers said 
a few classmates have greeted him with military salutes 
i just ignore them saddam said shrugging 
i dont like it when people make fun of him said scott 
rowan one of saddams best friends i take up for him

palestinians enraged by the death of a prison 
inmate clashed today with soliders using tear gas and 
gravelthrowing machines one protester was killed and dozens were 
injured arab and army reports said 
curfews were imposed on four villages and refugee camps in the 
occupied gaza strip in an effort to quell the unrest according to 
a statement from the army which reported at least 43 injuries 
among the protesters 
arab reports put the number of wounded in the gaza strip at 113 
including a 4yearold boy who was struck in the head by gravel

the clashes underscored a rise in arabisraeli tensions since 
the oct 8 temple mount killings of 20 arabs and subsequent 
stabbing deaths of three israelis in jerusalem

atti zanin 36 of beit hanoun village died in his jail cell in 
gaza city

made from blankets zanin was detained 13 days ago for questioning 
about links to the mainstream fatah wing of the palestine 
liberation organization 
prison services spokeswoman shulamit meiri said zanins body was 
found late friday it was believed he committed suicide because he 
was alone in the cell and there were no signs of violence she 
said

israeli soldiers killed zanin who had been jailed three times by 
israeli authorities 
youths took to the streets and began throwing stones at troops

exercises its a relief to know that they miss me less than i 
miss them 
an army logistics officer at fort lee va sheila is a woman 
who knows how to take control and get things done but saying 
goodbye to 6weekold connor is a tough order he is the michellis 
second son the last child the couple plan 
the most wrenching part about returning to work is giving up 
breastfeeding she writes at 553 pm after dropping the kids 
off with her parents and heading for nine days of crisis combat 
preparedness training 
connor ill see in 11 days but im done breastfeeding for 
good she writes its so final

the army where she believes working mothers have it pretty good

husband tom is a semiworkaholic who works as a computer 
programmer for virginias national guard 
because both are so committed to their careers tensions arise 
sometimes the couple ends up locking horns but sheila knows she 
can count on tom to help warm a bottle wash a load of diapers or 
be there when its time to drive the babysitter home 
it takes a lot of coordination and teamwork says sheila 
we argue but he supports me 
and that all the mothers agreed is key

the first day back at work was nothing short of traumatic 
pam salazar writes after going back to her job reporting for 
television station wkef in dayton ohio the thought of leaving 
my baby brought me to tears 
although willing to cut back on hours at the office and forgo 
her morning anchor position pam wasnt prepared to quit 
broadcasting altogether 
i guess i thought somehow the situation would magically work 
itself out she writes after finding out how it feels to be 
caught between news deadlines and her 5monthold daughter chase 
there are no magic wands when it comes to racing the clock pam 
may roar home to relieve the babysitter after a latebreaking news 
story or reel into work after prolonged morning goodbyes 
but breastfeeding is another story mother nature wont be 
rushed 
i was extremely nervous pam 28 wrote after her first 
disastrous attempt at expressing milk in an office bathroom 
would i be able to master the art would i manage to pump 
enough milk to feed my baby 
it was only after several attempts and with a lot of coaching by 
telephone from her husband kyle hickok that pam was able to get 
the gadget to draw milk the new mother felt like she was hogging 
the bathroom and perhaps embarrassing her colleagues and herself 
but my coworkers are very supportive of my breastfeeding 
she writes the news director bends over backwards to accommodate 
mother natures schedule allowing me to only go out on short 
stories so that i dont miss a pumping session 
the majority of employers are not as supportive of 6 million 
us companies only a slimminority offer subsidies referrals or 
onsite day care for working mothers 
some working mothers read a message in the writing on the wall 
they feel they are not valued members of the labor force down at 
the tv station pam found the kind of support many women crave 
and still there were tensions 
nursing is something i felt very strongly about but i had my 
doubts about how professional it would be she reflects im 
pulled both ways feeling guilty that im not doing either of 
my jobs very well

three french soldiers captured by iraqi troops and 
freed today will probably be punished for apparently straying over 
the saudi arabian border into iraq a french general said 
the soldiers arrived in amman jordan aboard an iraqi airways 
jet along with four freed american hostages a defense ministry 
spokesman said the soldiers would be flown to paris on sunday 
the official saudi press agency cited the joint forces command 
for multinational forces in the persian gulf as confirming that the 
french patrol had accidently crossed into iraq on monday 
the iraqi troops quickly took the three to baghdad and 
turned them over to the french embassy which is negotiating their 
departure from iraq french authorities said they declined to say 
when the soldiers were released 
this wasnt a willful act by our soldiers but probably an 
error in appreciating particularly difficult terrain where 
reference points practically dont exist brig gen raymond 
germanos of the defense ministry said in an inteview on 
franceinter radio 
the soldiers will almost assuredly be punished on completion of 
a military investigation into the incident germanos said 
in the military profession all faults are punished and this 
fault could have had the most serious consequences he said 
germanos ruled out the possibility that the patrol could have 
misunderstood standing orders which explicitly prohibit patrols 
from straying too close to the iraqi border 
but there were conflicting reports about whether the soliders 
were taken by iraqi troops in iraq or in saudi arabia 
the defense ministry said in a communique late friday that the 
soldiers were captured in the region of hafar el batin in 
northeastern saudi arabia but did not make clear whether the 
incident occurred on iraqi or saudi territory 
later at a news conference germanos said the investigation 
would clarify the soldiers exact location when captured he said 
he did not know what unit they were from 
a defense ministry source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said they committed an error of exceeding their mission theres 
a lot of movement around the border right now and we dont know 
exactly what happened the commander who has opened the 
investigation believes they are responsible 
other military sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the trio was composed of one officer and two noncommissioned 
officers in an allterrain vehicle the french soldiers were surprised 
by the iraqi troops but 
committed no hostile act the french foreign ministry said the 
communique did not say how big the iraqi patrol was 
there are about 5500 french soldiers including paratroopers 
and foreign legionaires stationed in saudi arabia 
defense sources said earlier friday that france might reinforce 
its ground troops in saudi arabia with artillery and 500 more 
soldiers 
france has about 13000 soldiers sailors and airmen in the 
region to defend saudi arabia and enforce un sanctions against 
iraq 
the multinational force of us and other troops in saudi arabia 
totals about 300000 facing an estimated 430000 iraqi troops in 
southern iraq and kuwait the baghdad government seized kuwait on

riots that exploded around a rundown 
little mosque in ayodhya last week threaten the concept of secular 
government on which religiously diverse india prides itself more 
than 300 people have been killed 
the strife comes at a time when indian politicians lacking 
clearcut ideologies are defining their vote blocs by religion 
police with shootonsight orders patrolled five northern indian 
towns saturday after renewed hindumoslem clashes claimed 13 more 
lives the press trust of india said police also said more victims 
were discovered from clashes friday bringing the overall death 
total to at least 305 
the issue has shaken prime minister vp singhs centrist 
government which gained power 11 months ago it is in trouble 
because it lost the support of the bharatiya janata party a 
rightwing hindu group singh faces a confidence vote wednesday 
singh might soon be deposed or relegated to a caretaker role 
which would leave india limping toward new elections four years 
ahead of schedule 
both the riots and government crisis were precipitated by the 
efforts of hindu fundamentalists to build a temple where they 
believe the god rama was born which happens to be under the 
ayodhya mosque the bharatiya janata fervently espoused the temple 
project 
emboldened by its makeorbreak position in the government the 
party claims to speak for indias hindu majority 
its rhetoric however often resembles that of an embattled 
minority especially after singh a hindu tried to halt the 
temple project while the courts sorted out conflicting hindumoslem 
claims to the site 
moslemsare only 12 percent of indias 880 million people and 
tend to keep a low profile especially when it comes to 
confrontation with the hindu majority of 82 percent despite this 
they went to court in an effort to save the 460yearold ayodhya 
mosque fearing that if it went others would follow 
the moslem suit provoked a tempestuous reaction 
they want to swallow the whole of india said vijay kumar 
malhotra secretary of the bharatiya janata and a parliamentarian 
they have the government siding with them the indian home 
minister is a moslem in india to be a hindu has become a crime 
a year ago indians were anxious for change and weary of 
allegations of corruption against prime minister rajiv gandhi they 
splintered their vote nobody won everyone lost 
gandhis congress party got 37 percent of the 522 parliament 
seats singhs national front coalition got 27 percent and the 
bharatiya janata bounced from nearobscurity to 17 percent singh 
teamed with the bharatiya janata and the communists to forge a 
majority 
there was little discernible difference in the platforms of 
democratic socialism presented by the congress party and national 
front and the communists stood only slightly to the left 
even the bharatiya janatas written manifesto was similar to 
those of the congress and the national front but its oratory 
appealed to a nationalism that increasingly tended toward hindu 
fundamentalism 
because singhs coalition was considered shaky from the start 
everyone started anticipating new elections and staking out 
constituencies 
the moslems minority can be pivotal in close elections the 
congress party and national front compete for the moslem vote and 
need to win hindus back from the bharatiya janata 
more and more riots are becoming political statements said 
ashis nandy a political analyst with the center for the study of 
developing societies an independent think tank 
many analysts say religious blocs have become more important in 
the absence of ideological constituencies almost any issue such 
as ayodhya that entices or placates one group alienates or 
threatens another 
religion is being used as a political tool said rev arokia 
doss a jesuit theologian who studies the interaction of indias 
different faiths 
mj akbar congress party spokesman singled out the bharatiya 
janata party for blame in the ayodhya violence but added 
you can get freedom by winning a war of independence a nation 
can be formed by a revolution but the state only stabilizes after 
its civil war 
akbar a moslem who has written extensively on indias internal 
frictions would not characterize indias current situation as 
civil war but a process of confrontation in order to achieve 
political power 
although riots and rebellions are frequent in india it also has 
a rich history of nonviolent protest and religious tolerance 
it broke free of british colonial rule in 1947 through peaceful 
protests and strikes led by mohandas k gandhi revered as the 
mahatma or great soul 
on the verge of that independence however it broke apart on 
religious lines and was partitioned into india predominately 
hindu and pakistan overwhelmingly moslem 
there was a bloody transmigration in which 1 million people 
died but nearly as many moslems remain in india as now live in 
pakistan 
memories of those violent days continue to stir hindumoslem 
antagonism but nandy found one legacy of hope 
even after a million killed we could go back to a normal 
life he said it left its scars but one could go back to 
civilized living but thats the optimistic view 
the pessimistic view 
each party will continue to play its own games

satellite broadcastings five channels to form a new fivechannel 
network called british sky broadcasting sky announced friday 
the merger brings to an end a satellite war with both sides 
claiming there can no longer be a loser in the television space 
race sky world news said in a bulletin

each network bidding against the other for feature films and sport 
the staples of satellite menus 
sky and british satellite will merge with a combined investment 
of 243 billion it said media magnate rupert murdochs company 
news international plc which owns sky and british satellites 
major shareholders will each hold 50 percent of the new company 
sky said

revenues and declining british television audiences

brenda mccoys two children had never 
gone to school with blacks before but when their rural district 
began accepting students bused from innercity neighborhoods they 
made some fast friends 
once you let the kids work it out by themselves one on one 
theres no problem their mother said 
doris brunson doesnt see it that way her suburban district has 
refused kansas city children despite pleas from judges and 
educators trying to desegregate schools a recent supreme court 
ruling may finally force the districts hand and that has her 
worried 
it has nothing to do with race the mother of two from 
independence said the innercity students could bring drugs and 
they could slow down her childrens progress she said we dont 
want any more problems than we already have 
to pat shanks its a matter of fairness she and her husband 
moved to the suburb of north kansas city when they decided to have 
a family 
we live here and pay our taxes here some of us have to work 
two jobs to live in these neighborhoods the kids who live here 
should go to these schools she said 
in the 13year history of kansas citys desegregation case no 
issue has created as much court wrangling and as few results as 
proposals to send innercity students to predominantly white 
suburban schools 
so far only 10 students have made the move the 10 that came 
this fall to mrs mccoys tiny district in rural missouri city 
a ruling last monday by the us supreme court increases the 
likelihood that more children could be bused out of the city soon 
no figure has ever been set for the number of minority students to 
be sent to the suburbs 
in 1978 a federal judge ruled that five suburban districts on 
the kansas side of the metropolitan area were not guilty of 
discrimination and six years later found the same way for 11 
districts in missouri he dismissed them as defendants in the 
desegregation case but asked the districts to take blacks 
voluntarily in exchange for tuition from the state they never did 
that prompted a lawsuit filed in 1988 by blacks denied 
admittance to three suburban districts in missouri independence 
north kansas city and lees summit because of the supreme court 
ruling the case can now go to trial the suburban districts say 
theyre weighing the option of settling out of court 
part of kansas citys desegregation effort attracting whites 
from suburban or private schools to special magnet schools 
has been fairly successful about 560 new nonminority students 
entered the district this fall just over half the goal of 1000 
but double last years number 
but 747 percent of the districts 35098 students still are 
minority most educators think the numbers will never balance until 
some black students go to other districts 
missouri city with just 105 students in elementary and junior 
high became the first testing ground because its superintendent 
thought it was the right thing to do 
its been very very successful said superintendent jay 
jackson our kids benefit too you know 
missouri citys success has reassured other suburban districts 
said george feldmiller a lawyer for those districts 
one of their biggest worries has been that the kansas city 
district criticized for mismanagement would try to run their 
schools feldmiller said missouri city prevailed in refusing to 
accept the oversight of a kansas city monitoring committee 
many people in the suburbs and some blacks in the city say the 
real answer is to improve kansas citys schools 
the rev nelson thompson executive director of the martin 
luther king urban center and president of kansas citys chapter of 
the southern christian leadership conference acknowledges that 
many black parents want to send their kids to the suburbs but he 
contends many others agree with him that busing is a bad idea 
theyre just going to be put into an environment that is 
hostile thompson said the people in the suburban districts 
dont want them there 
he said the real issue is the racial quotas a federal judge has 
placed on kansas citys magnet schools they have resulted in some 
black students being turned away from schools in their

air act which he supported i will sign this landmark 
legislation as soon as it gets to my desk bush said

for the nov 1921 conference to sign a 34nation treaty on 
reducing troops and tanks in europe spokesman marlin fitzwater

president hosni mubarak king fahd of saudi arabia and the exiled 
emir of kuwait 
details for bushs visit and whether he will visit sailors on 
us ships as well as troops stationed in saudi arabia have yet to 
be worked out said white house spokesman alixe glen 
she said a white house advance team left washington on friday

the president told a gop rally in rochester minn these are 
not easy times but never have i been more proud of the young men 
and women all volunteers highly motivated beautifully trained 
who are serving halfway around the world than i am today 
and we will not let them down 
earlier he told a cincinnati audience i will do my level 
best to bring every single one of them home without a shot fired in 
anger but we will not stop short of our stated objectives 
those objectives bush has said repeatedly over the past few 
days are a complete unconditional withdrawal by iraq from kuwait 
and restoration of the government of the emir of kuwait 
the united states has more than 210000 troops in the gulf 
region the largest force sent abroad since the vietnam war and 
washington plans to send 100000 more about 100000 soldiers have 
been deployed by other nations 
the 13nation force including troops from several moderate 
arab nations faces about 460000 iraqi troops stationed in 
southern iraq and kuwait

university here for sen pete wilson rcalif who is in a 
neckandneck race for governor with former san francisco mayor

barrage against the iraqi leader accusing him of inhumane 
treatment of us diplomats and hostages 
the brutality against innocent citizens will not be tolerated 
and will not stand he told his minnesota audience and the 
world should rise up and demand that those people be let go 
the white house would not discuss whether it was concerned that 
saddam might use bushs visit to launch an attack on us positions 
in saudi arabia or any other security concerns 
if we didnt think it was safe he wouldnt go said an 
official who commented only on condition of anonymity 
bush plans to leave washington on nov 16 for europe and return 
from the middle east on nov 23

as northeastern voters prepare to go to the polls 
on tuesday their mood can best be described as anger at an 
enveloping recession at record taxes and billiondollar budget 
deficits and at incumbents 
the three biggest issues are the economy the economy and the 
economy said thomas ferguson a political science professor at 
the university of massachusetts at boston youre looking at 
declining real estate values and youve got a lot of people losing 
their jobs 
in massachusetts and in three maryland counties residents will 
vote on taxbusting referendums incumbents in some hardhit states 
are running for their political lives and some quit rather than 
face the voters wrath 
gov michael dukakis of massachusetts rode his states 
prosperity to the democratic presidential nomination but when he 
lost and massachusetts wnt into a tailspin he raised taxes and 
said he would not run for reelection 
democratic govs william a oneill of connecticut and madeleine 
kunin of vermont also raised taxes and bowed out of the primaries 
still republican candidates seized on their unpopularity 
accusing them of budget mismanagement and big spending their 
democratic replacements tried to disassociate themselves from the 
incumbents they dubbed as political insiders 
two incumbent republican governors john r mckernan of maine 
and edward d diprete of rhode island ran for reelection and 
faced tough challenges the ramaining four incumbent governors who 
are up for reelection seem safe 
govs robert casey of pennsylvania and william d schaefer of 
maryland both democrats held the line on taxes and both states 
declared budget surpluses for the fiscal year ended june 30 new 
hampshire has no income or general sales tax and republican gov 
judd gregg opposed both 
democratic gov mario cuomo of new york appears assured of 
winning a third fouryear term despite a record 18 billion tax 
increase a state credit rating that is the third worst in the 
nation and a recent poll that found that 56 percent believed new 
york was headed in the wrong direction 
he faces a weak campaignbungling opponent pierre rinfret an 
economist and political novice who was chosen when no more 
prominent politician agreed to run and cuomo has been able to stay 
in front of the issues 
he anticipated the economic downturn and began to address it 
last january talking about how the problems in new york were of a 
national scope starting from washington said lee miringoff 
director of the marist college institute for public opinion in 
poughkeepsie ny he was able to deflect a lot of tension 
otherwise laid at his doorstep by talking about national political 
leadership 
the only question is whether cuomo can reach or top his record 
65 percent of the vote he received in 1986 a boost for a possible 
run for the presidency the tightest races appear to be in 
massachusetts maine and rhode island 
in massachusetts democrat john silber on leave as president of 
boston university and republican william weld a former assistant 
us attorney general both campaigned as outsiders who would 
return the states economy to good health both defeated their 
partys endorsed candidate in the primary 
silber opposes question 3 a referendum that would roll back 
taxes and some fees to their 1988 level weld supports it 
backers say massachusetts residents already pay the sixth 
highest taxes in the country and that during the last seven years 
the dukakis administration has increased spending from nearly 7 
billion to more than 13 billion 
if the referendum is approved opponents say it would roll back 
1 billion already collected and spent and cost massachusetts 6 
billion over three years forcing cutbacks in education programs 
for the elderly and other services 
referendums in montgomery anne arundel and baltimore counties 
in maryland would limit annual increases in property taxes to as 
low as 2 percent a year or would peg them to the previous years 
inflation rate montgomery county one of the wealthiest in the 
nation is a suburb of washington 
in maine us rep joseph e brennan a democrat is trying to 
unseat the republican incumbent mckernan brennan charged that 
mckernan failed to move quickly enough to counter the faltering 
economy brennan served two fouryear terms as governor before 
changing offices with mckernan in 1987 
rhode islands diprete is in danger of losing the governors 
office to democrat bruce g sundlun a millionaire businessman who 
is trying to unseat him for the third time diprete reversed 
himself on a pledge of no new taxes 
lowell p weicker jr former threeterm republican us senator 
who is running as an independent for the connecticut governors 
seat is favored to break the democratic partys twodecade hold on 
the office 
in vermont republican richard snelling gov kunins 
predecessor is the favorite to succeed her 
the only major races in new jersey and delaware are for the us

two roman catholic dioceses have admitted 
partial responsibility for psychological injury suffered by a 
24yearold man who was sexually abused by a priest as a teenager 
during opening arguments friday in a civil trial the man brought 
against the priest the mans attorney said the church placed the 
rev thomas adamson in positions of power and trust knowing he had 
a history of abusing boys 
john hoffman representing the archdiocese of st paul and 
minneapolis told the jury the church placed restrictions on 
adamson but the restrictions and the churchs monitoring of 
adamsons activities were not effective 
hoffman said church officials had information about alleged 
contact between adamson and teenage boys after those restrictions 
were imposed but did not check it out we could have we should 
have but we didnt hoffman said 
hoffman and george restovich an attorney for the diocese of 
winona admitted the church was guilty of negligence and said they 
will pay damages 
but they said the dioceses were innocent of willfully employing 
an unfit priest 
testimony is scheduled to begin monday in anoka county district 
court 
adamsons attorney said adamson accepts full responsibility for 
his actions and will not deny any of the allegations raised in the 
trial 
the case is only the third case of sexual abuse by a priest to 
come to trial in the country said jeffery anderson the victims 
attorney 
it is also the first case in which a judge has allowed a sexual 
abuse victim to seek punitive damages from the catholic church 
anderson said 
the case was one of six sexual abuse cases filed against 
adamson 57 who served parishes in southern minnesota and the twin 
cities from 1961 to 1984 four have been settled and one is 
pending 
adamson now lives in wisconsin and no longer functions as a 
priest 
one of his alleged victims who received an outofcourt 
settlement was convicted earlier this year of attempted 
firstdegree homicide for traveling to wisconsin to kill adamson 
anderson said his client who did not disclose the abuse until 
1989 can be treated and he may get better but he will not be 
cured 
hoffman and restovich said the church is not responsible for all 
of the mans problems 
they said he had a personality disorder before the abuse occured 
and came from a troubled family

the fifth civilian government in 43 
years took power saturday without ousted prime minister benazir 
bhutto who led her party in walking out on the new parliament 
the 37yearold ms bhutto and her pakistan peoples party 
boycotted the swearingin ceremony for the legislature after her 
jailed husband asif ali zardari was not allowed to attend 
the rightwing islamic democratic alliance which routed ms 
bhutto in last months election took the oath without her 
dozens of police carrying nightsticks surrounded the national 
assembly building and forced ms bhuttos supporters across a 
treelined boulevard 
ms bhutto initially rejected demands to boycott the opening 
session of the national assembly the lawmaking lower house of 
parliament but she walked out after zardari did not show up for 
the ceremony 
interior minister zahid safraz said adequate security 
arrangements could not be made to bring zardari from jail in the 
southern port city of karachi to the pakistani capital 
zardari won a legislative seat representing the sprawling 
karachi slum of lyari in the oct 24 elections he has been in jail 
since oct 10 on extortion charges 
earlier this week a judge ordered that zardari be allowed to 
take his parliamentary oath 
parliament speaker malik miraj khalid ordered the minister to 
bring zardari to islamabad for sundays legislative session when 
ms bhutto and her parliamentarians were expected to take the oath 
of office 
we assume zardari will be brought in and we will take our 
oath with him ms bhutto told reporters following her partys 
walkout 
zardari 38 has been blamed for many of ms bhuttos troubles 
since her government was ousted aug 6 he came under fire during 
her 20 months in power for allegedly demanding commissions on 
lucrative government contracts 
less than two years ago a triumphant ms bhutto was hailed by 
many as the torchbearer of democracy her populist party won the 
largest bloc of votes in the november 1988 elections pakistans 
first free polls after more than 11 years of military rule 
ms bhutto took over the prime ministers seat occupied by her 
father before his overthrow 11 years earlier he was hung two years 
later for allegedly killing political foes 
but only 20 months later she was fired by president ghulam 
ishaq khan who charged her government with widespread corruption 
and political ineptitude that he said had paralyzed pakistans 
parliament 
ms bhutto now faces seven charges of misconduct if shes found 
guilty on even one she can be banished from politics for seven 
years 
ishaq khan picked a caretaker government from among her bitter 
foes and former allies many belonged to the rightwing coalition 
that swept the polls last month 
ms bhutto said the election had been rigged but most observers 
said the fraud was not widespread and would not have changed the 
outcome 
today the pakistan peoples party controls only 45 seats in the 
national assembly compared to the democratic alliances 105 
nawaz sharif the alliance leader said most independent and 
smaller parties would fall in line behind his coalition 
the 41yearold industrialist will be the next prime minister 
he was the alliances unanimous choice for the post which will be 
decided by secret ballot in the assebbly next week 
its a distorted democracy but its better than nothing 
said iftikar gilaini a former law minister in ms bhuttos 
cabinet

bullets fatally shot a palestinian man and at least 89 people were 
hurt in riots set off by the death of an arab detainee 
arab reports put the number of injured in the gaza strip 
violence at 120 which would make it one of the highest daily 
figures during the 34monthold palestinian uprising 
the clashes underscored a rise in arabisraeli tensions since 
the oct 8 temple mount killings of 20 arabs and subsequent 
stabbing deaths of three israelis in jerusalem 
the unrest began after soldiers informed the family of attiyah 
abdel atti zanin 36 in the gaza village of beit hanoun that he 
had hanged himself in prison 
zanin was detained 13 days ago for questioning about activism in 
the palestine liberation organization israeli and arab reports 
said 
his body was found in gaza city prison friday night dangling 
from a rope made of blankets prison services spokeswoman shulamit 
meiri said 
she said the authorities believed the death was a suicide since 
he was alone in a cell and there were no other signs of violence on 
the body but zanins family demanded an autopsy to determine the 
cause of death 
rumors also spread quickly through the village of 11000 that 
zanin had been killed by soldiers spurring youths to take to the 
streets where they stoned israeli troops arab reports said 
troops opened fire killing mohammed izzat abdullah el 
bassiouny 36 of a bullet wound to the head the reports added 
the army said bassiouny was 29 
he was the 771st palestinian to be killed by israelis in the 
uprising in the west bank and gaza strip which are home to 17 
million palestinians and some 70000 jewish settlers 
another 293 arabs have been killed by fellow palestinians as 
alleged collaborators with israel and 55 israelis and foreigners 
have been killed 
riots spread from beit hanoun to six neighborhoods and refugee 
camps in the vicinity of nearby gaza city the reports added 
witnesses said soldiers sprayed tear gas out of helicopters and 
used gravelthrowing machines in some spots to contain the 
violence 
the army said 89palestinians were injured in gaza most of them 
moderately or slightly injured the military said the shooting was 
in response to numerous riots in gaza 
four villages and refugee camps in gaza were placed under 
curfew 
arab reports said 102 palestinians were wounded in these 
clashes of these 49 were struck by live ammunition and 48 by

pope john paul ii told roman catholic 
pharmacists saturday they have a moral duty to refrain from 
providing drugs which can be used directly or indirectly against 
life 
in a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the 
international federation of catholic pharmacists the pope said the 
production distribution and usage of medicines must be controlled 
by a rigorous moral code 
the pope did not specify any drugs but his comments could have 
referred to birth control and abortion pills and substances used 
for euthanasia church teaching outlaws artificial birth control 
abortion and euthanasia 
the forms of aggression against life and its dignity are 
becoming more numerous especially with the recourse to drugs 
while these should never be used against life directly or 
indirectly john paul said in french 
in distributing drugs the pharmacist cannot renounce the 
needs of his conscience in the name of the rigid laws of the 
market the pope said 
for the catholic pharmacist church teaching on the respect of 
life and the dignity of the human person from the moment of 
conception until its last moments is of an ethical and moral 
nature it can not be subjected to variations of opinions or 
applied to the whims of fluctuating options 
john paul acknowledged that pharmacists may find it difficult to 
uphold the church teaching but he stressed these fundamental 
guidelines cannot be renounced

labor party leader gro harlem brundtland 
returned as norways prime minister saturday and promptly sought 
peace with conservatives who toppled her last two governments 
ms brundtland took over after the threeparty coalition of 
former conservative prime minister jan p syse splintered over 
disputes on the nations stance for european trade negotiations 
we have disagreed a lot our parties do but at the same 
time there is a lot that we agree on in this very important time 
for norway she told syse who resigned monday after a year in 
the post 
the new government has 63 seats and needs support among the 
other five parties in the 165seat national assembly to get its 
policies approved 
the conservatives have twice ousted ms brundtland but syse 
promised a reasonable but determined opposition 
syses party favors having the sixnation european free trade 
association move closer to the 12nation european economic 
community the two trade blocs are discussing possibly opening all 
18 nations to unrestricted trade after 1992 
 
but the center party fears possible changes in business laws for 
norway a member of the european free trade association 
ms brundtland 51 said her first tasks were to draft a 1991 
national budget and define norways position for the ecc talks 
ms brundtland a physician and harvardeducated public health 
expert was formally installed by crown prince harald he is acting 
monarch while his father king olav v recovers from a stroke 
a popular political figure who is usually called by her first 
name she was greeted outside her new office by hundreds of 
norwegians many offering her flowers 
give me a g give me an r give me an o we have gro 
cheered some admirers 
ms brundtland will present a government policy declaration 
early next week 
labors first test may come in dealing with proposed tax 
reductions for higher income families which the former coalition 
parties drafted and still favor 
it wont be any easier than the last time she said about 
ruling with a minority government 
ms brundtland was forced out of office in 1981 after seven 
months in office and again last october after more than three 
years in the post both times nonsocialists held a majority in 
parliament she was the nations youngest and first woman prime 
minister 
some norwegians criticized ms brundtland for appointing 
thorvald stoltenberg as foreign minister after he served only 10 
months of his fiveyear term as un high commissioner for 
refugees 
we need his experience as a foreign minister in this very 
crucial phase for our government and country said ms 
brundtland stoltenberg was foreign minister in the last labor 
government 
ms brundtland said she may recommend center party member tom 
vraalsen to succeed stoltenberg in the genevabased refugee post

two people who rescued a pregnant woman from 
an overturned car moments before it exploded are being sued by 
another accident victim they didnt have time to help 
construction worker james campbell and police officer dale 
turner pulled norma macias from her car jan 30 just before it was 
hit by another car and burst in flames two hours later mrs 
macias delivered a 6pound 8ounce girl at a hospital 
anzelma sanchezsianez 17 who was riding in the same car is 
suing campbell and turner for negligence her lawyer paul jay 
bershin filed suit oct 4 
turner was served with the legal papers thursday as he was going 
to the police academy to be honored with a medal of valor 
the suit names two other people gloria mcneal whose car hit 
the overturned car then allegedly careened into sanchezsianez as 
she was sitting dazed against the center divider and mrs macias 
husband ricardo who was driving the car when it overturned on the 
san diego freeway 
i still cant believe this is happening campbell said i 
was trying to save lives 
if campbell had not stopped and been a good citizen i have 
absolutely no doubt in my mind all those people would have 
perished said turner a 20year police department veteran 
the suit claims turner who was en route to work when he saw the 
early morning accident was negligent in failing to set up flares 
or warnings to oncoming motorists to indicate that an accident had 
occurred 
the suit also claims turner and campbell permitted 
sanchezsianez to remain in a position of peril on the freeway 
its unclear how sanchezsianez who spent a month in the hospital 
got out of the car 
according to bershin the family has a couple of hundred 
thousand dollars in medical bills 
the girls body looks like a road map he said 
according to turner he and campbell had only about 60 to 80 
seconds to react to the emergency in the initial moments there was 
confusion caused by the pregnant woman screaming about her baby 
the woman macias was screaming for her baby turner said 
i was desperately searching in the overturned car for a child 
then i looked at her and realized she was in labor she was having 
her baby 
i saw a vehicle coming flashing its high and low beams i 
thought good the chp california highway patrol is here to 
help 
until that moment the men thought the overturned car was on the 
lefthand breakdown lane then they realized it was in the traffic 
lane 
i thought my god were in the fast lane turner said 
we grabbed her macias legs and carried her over the divider to 
safety as we turned to lift the girl over the mcneal car hit 
the overturned car and careened off smashing into the divider and 
hitting the girl sanchezsianez 
we moved as fast as we could in that minute turner said

special trains carried people from 
riottorn areas near a disputed mosque saturday as fundamentalist 
hindus debated whether to keep up efforts to seize the site 
at least 305 deaths have been reported across india in unrest 
linked to attempts by hindus to raze the 16th century mosque and 
build a hindu temple in ayodhya about 300 miles southeast of new 
delhi 
at least 13 people died saturday in areas around ayodhya 
including a police constable who had suffered head wounds during 
hindu attempts to storm the mosque friday

council has been asking people to leave town saying they had

three republican and five democratic senators 
have urged president bush to lift the us trade embargo on 
vietnam saying it has outlived its usefulness and is penalizing 
american business in the face of foreign competitors particularly 
from japan and france 
trade with vietnam would foster american interests across the 
board according to a letter to the president signed by the eight 
lawmakers 
the letter drafted by sen richard lugar rind and sent to 
bush a week ago argued in recent months the united states has 
become increasingly isolated in its maintenance of the economic 
embargo against vietnam european and asian businesses are now 
enjoying unilateral advantages some of the most promising 
construction and development contracts have already been 
committed 
the letter noted that the government of vietnam now estimates 
that 115 billion worth of foreign capital has been committed to 
investment projects in vietnam once again the united states risks 
forfeiting a market to our foreign competitors 
others signing the letter were democrats claiborne pell of rhode 
island alan cranston of california joseph r biden jr of 
delaware john f kerry of massachusetts and christopher j dodd of 
connecticut and republicans frank h murkowski of alaska and mark 
o hatfield of oregon 
the embargo was imposed on north vietnam in 1964 and extended 
to the entire country after the communists seized saigon in 1975 
violators face penalties of up to 1 million and 10 years 
imprisonment 
the us governments resolve on the issue was stiffened in 
1978 when vietnam invaded its neighbor cambodia to overthrow the 
brutal khmer rouge government there the khmer rouge and two 
noncommunist guerrilla factions supported by the united states 
have been fighting the government that vietnam installed ever 
since 
usvietnam relations also have been snagged over the us 
effort to recover the remains of soldiers killed in the vietnam war 
and to account for 1677 americans still officially listed as 
missing in action 
but vietnamese foreign minister nguyen co thach recently pledged 
heightened cooperation on that issue the new policy allows for a 
permanent us team to operate in hanoi to coordinate the search 
effort 
moreover vietnam has withdrawn most of its forces from 
cambodia and administration officials have credited hanoi with 
cooperating with a unsponsored plan to organize elections and 
end the civil war there 
citing those developments business groups have argued for weeks 
that the political justifications for the embargo have largely 
vanished in any case they say it is having no significant 
effect because european and asian companies are moving into 
vietnam in growing numbers 
its another example of america seeking to further foreign 
policy interests by penalizing american companies and at the same 
time not achieving the foreignpolicy goals said william archey 
vice president for international affairs at the us chamber of 
commerce 
but so far such arguments have fallen on deaf ears in the bush 
administration although it is cautiously expanding contacts with 
vietnam after 15 years of a nearly total freeze an aide to lugar 
andrew k semmel said saturday the white house had yet to respond 
to the senate groups letter and thats not surprising he 
said there are a lot of different opinions within the 
administration itself on this 
in a july policy shift the administration dropped its 
diplomatic support for the guerrilla coalition in cambodia but it 
has continued to grant noncombat assistance to the two 
noncommunist rebel groups loosely aligned with the khmer rouge 
which was responsible for the deaths of at least a million 
cambodians during its four years in power 
many western countries still maintain sanctions against vietnam 
but most interpret them more liberally than does the united states 
particularly in regard to oil 
european oil companies have signed deals to develop offshore 
deposits discovered by an american firm mobil oil corp in the 
early 1970s several japanese trading companies have set up shop in 
vietnam as have french banks and textile makers from singapore and 
canada 
american telephone amp telegraph co eager for customers among 
the 700000 vietnameseborn residents of the united states has 
twice sent teams to vietnam and concluded longdistance 
phoneservice deal with the government there but the state 
department has withheld approval 
other us corporate delegations continue to visit vietnam to 
prepare for the time the embargo is removed among the visitors 
this year were representatives of mobil the chevron corp and 
texaco inc other american firms are exploring mining fishing 
tourism and agricultural prospects 
even when and if the embargo is lifted no one expects a 
bonanza exhausted by decades of war and mismanagement vietnam 
remains one of the worlds poorest and most technically undeveloped 
nations its 67 million people also face the additional challenge 
of a phaseout of the soviet aid that has helped keep the country 
afloat 
but some analysts believe that if it stays with freemarket 
reforms it has begun vietnam could emerge in the long run as a 
solid economic performer as have many of its neighbors in 
southeast asia it is sometimes compared to china 10 years ago

president bush after raising a record 86 
million for republicans this year was spending the final days 
before tuesdays elections searching for candidates to help and 
themes to sound 
both seemed difficult to find 
the presidents final campaign extravaganza was sharply pared as 
he planned to devote his final energies to helping gop 
gubernatorial candidate clayton williams in texas bushs adopted 
home state 
bush tinkered through the final week with his basic stump speech 
first bashing democrats and accusing them of making him swallow 
tax increases then dropping that approach to fire verbal salvos at 
iraqs saddam hussein 
bush was to spend saturday sunday and monday nights at his 
legal voting residence a hotel suite here with a planned foray 
around the state monday to drum up support for williams in his 
close race with democrat ann richards 
the president will vote here tuesday then return to the white 
house to await election returns 
have plane will travel was bushs theme as he took the 
prestige of the presidency to 112 campaign events from the 
beginning of his term through saturday raising 856 million for 
gop candidates in 35 states 
we go to places where they ask us and where we can make a 
difference said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
but finally bush ran out of places and campaigning became 
unlike any he had encountered with some candidates holding him at 
arms length and others repudiating his stand on the budget and 
taxes from the very podium on which he stood 
stops planned for the past few days in oregon illinois 
nebraska and arizona were scrubbed in each of those states the 
governors races were considered too close to call as was the 
senate race in oregon according to an associated press survey 
even bushs revised plan to spend sunday making video 
appearances at rallies around the nation was scrapped 
david carney white house political director said the major 
emphasis in the final days of the campaign was firing up republican 
troops to get out the vote 
asked if tuesdays election is a referendum on bush carney 
said absolutely not its a midterm election its impossible 
to say its a referendum on the president 
midterm elections are decided districtbydistrict carney 
said 
the white house said the president on sunday planned to make 
phone calls from his houston suite to rallies for congressional 
candidates in alaska utah nebraska and maryland 
at one time there were 20 or 30 potential locations for 
bushs final week said norman cummings political director of the 
republican national committee instead bush will have 11 events in 
six days 
cummings said the inability of local campaigns to shoulder the 
cost of a presidential visit so close to election day was a key 
factor in canceling many proposed appearances 
another problem is the new air force one a boeing 747 jumbo jet 
that turns out to be too heavy to land on many american airport 
runways 
there are three values of a presidential stop raising money 
pumping up the trip and the attendant publicity and local tv 
coverage you get cummings said 
but even a presidential visit doesnt ensure a gop victory 
the presidential popularity doesnt win or lose elections 
other than the presidency cummings said we didnt have these 
races in the bag when he was at 80 percent and they arent in the 
bag when hes at 60 percent 
with his popularity plunging bush suddenly found himself more 
of a liability than a help to some candidates particularly in 
states where taxes were a heated issue polls have shown bushs 
approval rating dropping to as low as 55 percent in the aftermath 
of the budget debacle 
at the same time the two campaign veterans who had engineered 
his 1988 presidential victory secretary of states james a baker 
iii and lee atwater head of the republican national committee 
were unavailable to give him much daytoday guidance 
baker has been preoccupied with the persian gulf crisis and 
ussoviet relations atwater has been sidelined with an 
inoperable brain tumor 
so much of bushs political advice in the past few weeks has 
come from chief of staff john sununu fresh from the budget and tax 
talks that have proved such difficult political terrain for the 
president 
sununu has had the final say other than the president himself 
on both the message of bushs campaign speeches and his 
itinerary 
the past week has seen a succession of new messages 
in oklahoma on monday bush unleashed a blistering attack on 
democrats seeking to shift the blame for the budget debacle to 
them aides said it would be the theme he would carry through 
election day 
but then abruptly he dropped it toning down his attack on 
democrats and turning it up on saddam 
thursday he was accusing saddam of being worse than hitler in 
some respects a statement some jewish leaders said went too far 
by friday hitler was out of the speeches 
but the president was able to keep the focus on the iraq 
confrontation and away from the tax fiasco day after day 
through fridays announcement that he would spend thanksgiving with 
us troops in the persian gulf 
why did bush stop his most strident bashing of democrats on the 
budget 
its not a change of heart its a question of i think i 
made my point he said 
but bush told reporters in orlando fla on friday to stay 
tuned 
i think its a little too early to say that there will be no 
more flamboyant rhetoric about the democrats because im absolutely 
convinced if we had more republicans things would be a lot 
better

the communist party began its 
congress saturday hoping to remake its image but a bomb threat and 
a strike of conference hall workers marred the event 
the staff of pragues palace of culture the traditional site of 
party caucuses walked off the job to protest the congress the 868 
delegates opted to meet in another location sunday when the 
meeting is scheduled to end 
an anonymous caller said a bomb had been planted at the congress 
site interrupting the meeting for an hour police searched the 
hall but found nothing 
in its first day the congress decided to form a federation 
council to coordinate work of the czech and the slovak parties over 
the next two years as well as any other political party wishing to 
join the federation in the future 
there was also balloting for leadership roles within the 
communist party 
miroslav grebenicek 43 a newcomer to the party leadership 
defeated former chairman vasil mohorita to become the czech 
candidate for the party chairmanship the official news agency ctk 
reported 
the vote appeared to confirm the partys attempt to shed the 
image of communist orthodoxy mohorita was close to the government 
of milos jakes before the countrys peaceful revolution ousted 
communists from power in november 1989 
but later grebenicek openly endorsed rival slovak candidate 
pavol kanis and the final vote for the partys top post to take 
place sunday seemed a foregone conclusion 
i think mr kanis is much more qualified for the job than i 
and i will be happy with remaining the number two for the time 
being grebenicek said at a news conference saturday 
according to new rules the two leaders will alternate the 
chairmanship every two years 
jiri svoboda a wellknown film director leads the czech 
communist party while peter weiss an established leftwing 
reformer heads the slovak party 
establishment of the federation is also a strong signal to other 
czechoslovak leftwing groupings to cooperate as genuine political 
pluralism develops 
in spite of running second in the countrys free elections in 
june communists were kept out of the current government coalition 
earlier this week the left alternative headed by veteran 
dissident petr uhl and obroda renewal another leftwing group 
in civic forum the countrys leading political grouping were 
expelled from the movement for not abiding by its political 
viewpoints 
the move was seen as an attempt by civic forums new chairman 
vaclav klaus to transform the loose democratic alliance into 
several clearcut political parties after parlimaentary elections 
in 1992 
our program has a lot to do with some leftwing oriented 
groups in the civic forum kanis toold journalists saturday to 
think civic intiatives can replace political parties is 
premature he said 
the communists gained 135 percent of the vote in the june 
elections but their membership has been shrinking reaching a 
record low of 450000 analysts have said

the privacy actor marlon brando 
attained at his hilltop mansion has dissolved in the five months 
since his pregnant daughters lover was shot to death there 
brandos son christian is about to go on trial for murder and 
the troubled life of his daughter cheyenne has taken center stage 
as she recovers from a drug overdose in a tahiti hospital 
miss brando 20 is the key witness to events which led to the 
death of 26yearold dag drollet but she fled to tahiti a month 
after the killing gave birth to a child and has refused to return 
to testify 
authorities in tahiti also have barred her exit from the island 
charging her as an accomplice in the murder 
marlon brando flew to tahiti friday to be with his daughter 
christian brandos trial was scheduled to start monday but the 
international legal tangle concerning miss brandos testimony has 
caused a delay prosecutors say they cant win the case without her 
testimony 
the 2nd district court of appeal blocked the trial but could let 
jury selection begin monday or seek more time to study the case 
christian brandos lawyer robert shapiro said cheyennes drug 
overdose would further delay the trial 
this has put a damper on everything shapiro said the 
concern of everyone is for cheyennes health and recovery and the 
criminal case seems less important 
drollet was found sprawled on a sofa at the brando home with a 
single bullet wound in his cheek on may 16 
police said he had a tv remote control in one hand and a 
cigarette lighter in the other hand brandos defense team disputes 
that report and has hired forensic experts to recreate the death 
scene 
christian brando told police the killing was an accident 
i shot him man but not on purpose he said 
at another point he was quoted as saying i did it because he 
hurt my sister 
christian brando also told police he did not like drollet 
saying death is too good for the guy 
before miss brando left the country she told police its a 
murder in case you dont know it 
prosecutors say christian brando decided to kill drollet because 
he had been physically abusing his sister he is charged him with 
premeditated first degree murder they intend to introduce as 
evidence information about his past and his involvement with guns 
but shapiro said his client is guilty of no more than 
involuntary manslaughter he suggests the gun accidentally went off 
when christian and drollet fought over it 
miss brandos version of events has never been clear she has 
given at least five depositions in the united states and tahiti 
in one deposition she accused her father of complicity saying 
marlon brando was fixated with the godfather and that he was 
crazy on the subject she later retracted that statement 
cheyennes life has been a focus of attention from the start of 
the brando affair 
the young woman was said to be emotionally disturbed drug 
addicted and still suffering the effects of a near fatal auto 
accident in 1989 which smashed her face 
she was sevenmonths pregnant the day marlon brando dialed 911 
to tell police there had been a shooting at his mulholland drive 
mansion 
marlon brando is expected to testify at his sons trial 
the attorneys first chore will be to find jurors unaffected by 
the blitz of publicity that has surrounded the case 
i think that will be impossible shapiro said i cant 
imagine anyone in this community who hasnt heard about this 
case 
this whole thing has got this star quality it has an aura 
around it deputy district attorney steven barshop said i 
think there will be a lot of people who want to sit on a jury like 
this because they think its exciting

launching a fastpaced trip to seven 
countries secretary of state james a baker iii said saturday he 
would lay the foundation for military action against iraq if 
economic measures failed to persuade saddam hussein to withdraw 
from kuwait 
baker planned to consult over eight days with leaders of a wide 
array of arab and european nations including a stop next thursday 
in moscow to see soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
we would like to know under what conditions and subject to 
what restraints they would be willing to consider certain types of 
actions baker told reporters aboard his us jetliner 
the purpose of the trip baker said is to discuss with 
our coalition partners strengthening the full range of measures 
that w have employed to isolate saddam hussein political 
measures economic measures and military measures and thereby to 
lay the foundation for the possible exercise of all options 
baker added this will improve the prospects for peaceful 
resolution and at the same time permit us to be prepared to 
consider all options if peaceful ones dont work 
baker also stressed the united states had the right of 
selfdefense under the un charter president bush has been 
pointing in that direction recently with angry denunciations of the 
saddam the iraqi president for taking more than 100 americans 
hostage and blocking food and other supplies from reaching the us 
embassy in kuwait 
bush said last week that in some ways saddam has been more 
brutal than nazi germanys adolph hitler who ordered mass 
exterminations during world war ii 
bakers silver and blue plane packed with senior white house 
pentagon and state department officials stopped here for refueling 
before flying on to bahrain where baker will hold talks sunday with 
sheik isa bin salman alkhalifa and other leaders of the persian 
gulf ministates 
from there he moves on to saudi arabia where more than 100000 
us ground troops are defending the worlds richest oilfields he 
will see saudi leaders and also the ousted emir of kuwait jabir 
alsabah 
before returning home next saturday baker will have consulted 
with soviet chinese british and french officials and others 
together with the united states these nations are the five 
permanent members of the un security council 
baker did not rule out an escalation of the economic and 
political pressures the united states and most of the rest of the 
world have put on saddam since the aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but like the president of late baker put increased stress on 
military action even while declining to say what specifically the 
administration has in mind an escalation of bellicose rhetoric 
from bush baker and john sununu the presidents chief of staff 
has heightened a sense of expectation that military force may be 
used to try to pry kuwait away from saddam 
bush said he had had it with iraqs treatment of american 
hostages and diplomats on thursday he said i dont think the 
status quo can go on forever 
on the other hand the president also told reporters in orlando 
fla that im not trying to sound the tocsin of war and on 
friday he said his hope was that us forces in the persian gulf 
now more than 210000 strong can return home without a shot 
fired in anger 
amid the buildup in tensions the soviet union saudi arabia 
france and others have adopted a softer tone with an emphasis on 
finding a channel to negotiate with saddam the saudis also have 
indicated a willingness to strike a compromise 
baker said the soviets were committed to full implementation of 
the 10 resolutions adopted by the security council against iraq 
beyond that baker said he would reserve any comment until he saw 
gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in moscow 
he said he would report his findings to president bush on his 
return 
asked if saddam understood the possibility of an attack to 
loosen his grip on kuwait baker said you are dealing with 
someone who is very difficult to predict so i cant read his 
mind 
and yet baker added i think we have made it extraordinarily 
clear we are unwilling to rule out the use of force i think most 
people believe that 
baker will stop in cairo on tuesday to meet with egyptian 
president hosni mubarak a staunch ally in the campaign against 
iraq while there he also will meet with chinese foreign miniser 
qichen qian 
bakers other stops are turkey britain and france he is due to 
return to washington next saturday take a breath and get ready 
for another spate of overseas travel attending a 34nation summit 
meeting in paris nov 1921 visiting the troops in the gulf with 
bush over thanksgiving and accompanying the president to south 
america in early december

a wire service guild official said saturday 
the union will recommend members turn down a united press 
international request that employees take a temporary 35 percent 
pay cut as a preliminary to sale of the financially struggling news 
service 
chris dahl secretarytreasurer of guild said the upi proposal 
for a 90day pay cut would be submitted to union members for a 
vote but we will recommend rejection 
dahl said things are so desperate at this point we dont think 
this wage cut will be enough either the situation is very bleak 
unless upi can come up with a buyer very fast 
dahl said upi officials made the request for the 35 percent cut 
during eight hours of negotiations in philadelphia on friday 
attended by dahl and guild president kevin keane the meeting ended 
without resolving the wage issue 
its not a bitter situation at all dahl said in a telephone 
interview from new haven conn wed love to see the company stay 
afloat but id be lying if i said we were optimistic 
upis negotiations with the guild coincided with upis 
announcement friday that all management and employees not covered 
by the guild contract will have their wages cut by 35 percent over 
the next three months the pay cuts take effect sunday 
the washingtonbased news service also changed company policy so 
that nonunion employees could be dismissed without advance notice 
or severance pay 
upi spokesman milt capps on saturday declined to reveal details 
of negotiations between the news agency and the guild but said 
we are asking support from both nonguild and guild members in 
the organizations latest economy moves 
upi executive vice president pieter vanbennekom in a message to 
all members of the staff friday said all these drastic measures 
are necessary to bring upi immediately to cash flow 
selfsufficiency and to stabilize the company during the next few 
months to be able to effect a sale of upi in the shortest possible 
order 
the news service has changed ownership three times in the past 
eight years and is now owned by infotechnology inc last week 
infotechnology announced a management shakeup and disclosed 
financial problems that could result in the sale of its businesses 
the company also owns financial news network 
in september upi announced that it was closing bureaus in five 
states and said oct 21 that it will dismiss an unspecified number 
of employees as it concentrates its reporting in 15 of the most 
populous states 
dahl said upi did not propose additional layoffs they are so 
handtomouth at this point that layoffs arent the answer 
he said the guild will recommend rejection of the 35 percent 
wage cut because were already down to bone as it is he noted 
that the guild accepted a 25 percent reduction in salaries during a 
1984 financial crisis 
dahl said upi has about 250 union members it has another 600 
nonunion employees including about 100 who are covered by the 
guild contract ballots will be mailed to union members on tuesday 
and results of the vote should be made known around nov 16 dahl 
said 
capps said upi also may ask news organizations that buy its 
services to accept higher rates 
vanbennekom said in his staff memo that there have been at least 
six preliminary expressions of interest in buying upi some from 
bluechip companies 
to bring the process to a successful conclusion we need the 
breathing space these measures will provide he said

republican sen mark hatfields opponent 
crashed one of his news conferences and got in the last question by 
asking hatfield to debate him sunday 
hatfield who has refused such requests from democrat harry 
lonsdale walked away without responding 
im conducting a press conference not a circus hatfield 
said later when asked what he thought about lonsdales visit 
friday 
when lonsdale appeared hatfield stumbled over his words before 
regaining his composure 
lonsdale stood silently as hatfield criticized lonsdale again 
for supporting bhagwan shree rajneesh in 1985 after the indian guru 
pleaded guilty to federal crimes lonsdales claim that he was 
merely defending religious freedom doesnt wash hatfield said 
the issue isnt religious freedom its a question of 
judgment he said 
lonsdale later criticized hatfield for witnessing a shooting 
last year in washington dc and failing to report to police 
as a citizen he had an obligation as a senator he had no 
excuse lonsdale said we all make mistakes and do things we 
regret but mark hatfield should reflect on his own failings before 
he criticizes my judgment 
at a separate news conference gary kahn lonsdales campaign 
counsel called for a threecounty task force to investigate a 
burglary at lonsdales home last week 
what appears to be a politically motivated crime of this 
nature is unprecedented in the history of oregon politics kahn 
said for this reason the lonsdale campaign is today asking for 
a special task force to be set up 
the deschutes county sheriffs office said the investigation has 
failed to turn up any suspects kahn stressed he was not accusing 
the hatfield campaign of committing the burglary 
julie mcgregor a spokeswoman for hatfield said the senator 
feels that its unfortunate that such a crime should occur so 
close to an election but its equally unfortunate that lonsdale is 
trying to lay blame on hatfield supporters 
he said files were ransacked during the burglary and a copying 
machine at lonsdales home was used extensively during the crime 
among the items taken in the burglary late tuesday or early 
wednesday were a computer and computer disks containing financial 
information on lonsdale campaign contributors 
also taken were video and stereo equipment a typewriter and a 
telephone a kitchen door was forced open to gain entry to the home 
12 miles west of bend 
a preliminary sheriffs investigative report on the burglary 
said clues found at the scene included foot prints tire tracks a 
cigarette butt and two threatening calls left on the lonsdale 
answering machine before the crime

the golden gate bridge made it through the 
big 1989 earthquake without any apparent damage but bridge 
directors think a 100 million quakeproofing project would be a 
wise investment 
quite frankly thats a good bargain said director jim 
harberson 
he said replacing the 53yearold golden gate would cost about 
1 billion 
a committee of bridge directors voted friday to spend 550000 
for a design study on a project that would srengthen the bridge so 
it can withstand an earthquake with a richter scale magnitude of 8 
or greater 
the retrofitting project would cost 75 million to 100 million 
and financing remains the big question harberson said 
the october 1989 earthquake registered 71 on the richter scale 
and claimed 67 lives it knocked out a section of the san

officials of the crumbling warsaw pact 
agreed saturday on a plan to divide up their tanks and other 
conventional weapons paving the way for an eastwest accord 
covering all of europe 
hungarian foreign minister geza jeszenszky called it the first 
step toward a new system of security in europe replacing the 
cold war confrontation that plagued europe for more than four 
decades 
the accord cleared what western officials had said was the last 
major hurdle to an agreement limiting the number of tanks armored 
vehicles aircraft and artillery in europe it is to be signed in 
paris this month 
the 34 nations of the conference on security and cooperation in 
europe are set to sign a major eastwest conventional arms 
reduction agreement nov 19 in the french capital 
it will be a new beginning to unite europe foreign minister 
krzysztof skubiszewski of poland said after the signing 
the agreement came at a time when the future of the sovietled 
bloc which also includes czechoslovakia romania and bulgaria 
is in question as former loyal allies reorient themselves toward 
the west east germany a former pact member was absorbed into a 
united germany 
hungary and czechoslovakia want the alliance to end its military 
role by the middle of next year and to remain only as a loose 
political grouping 
as a military organization i would not bet that it would last 
as long as the end of next year jeszenszky told reporters 
later in a news conference he cited a growing general 
agreement among members to end the pacts military role 
skubiszewski told reporters the warsaw pact will disappear 
because it will no longer correspond to the need of that part of 
europe it has lost its sense 
however soviet deputy foreign minister yuli kvitsinsky said the 
agreement signed saturday had nothing to do with the warsaw pacts 
future as a military alliance 
the warsaw pact lives and fulfills a useful function he 
said 
in june leaders of the warsaw pact countries meeting in moscow 
decided to change it from a primarily military to political 
organization he said 
kvitsinsky substituted at the last minute for soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze he said shevardnadze could not 
come because of commitments in the soviet union 
he denied that they were connected with ethnic violence in the 
republic of moldavia which borders romania 
warsaw pact experts agreed in prague czechoslovakia last 
weekend on how to divide among themselves the 20000 tanks and 
other conventional weapons they may keep within the agreement 
between east and west 
the western nato alliance will be allowed to keep similar levels 
of weapons but will have to destroy far fewer than members of the 
eastern alliance 
czechoslovak officials said after last weeks meeting that the 
soviets will keep 13150 of the 20000 tanks 150 fewer than they 
had wanted 
most of the other warsaw pact countries will keep between 1000 
and 2000 tanks the levels must be reached in a period of 40 
months after the agreement is signed in paris 
hungarian officials aid one final issue to be settled dealt 
with how many tanks the soviet union must place in storage both 
east and west must store about 15 percent of their total number of 
tanks the soviets wanted assurances they would not have to store 
proportionally more than any other country 
us officials have said president bush will attend the paris

shouts of one settler one 
bullet rang out saturday as about 3000 blacks attended the 
funeral of zeph mothopeng leader of the militant pan africanist 
congress 
the black opposition group follows a more radical philosophy 
than the african national congress and some other groups opposing 
the whiteled government the phrase one settler one bullet 
refers to killing whites 
mothopeng a popular antiapartheid activist who was jailed 
several times for his activities died last month at age 77 after a 
lengthy illness he split from the anc three decades ago to help 
form and later lead the pan africanist congress which refuses to 
recognize the whiteled government and opposes sharing power 
joe slovo leader of the south african communist party and 
representatives of the canadian swedish and british governments 
attended saturdays ceremony 
youths in congress tshirts escorted the coffin into the stadium 
as the crowd chanted when slovo who is white arrived some in 
the crowd shouted one slovo one bullet 
at one point in the service about 50 people began chasing a 
black man accused of being a police agent and beat him until pan 
africanist congress officials intervened the crowd blocked 
journalists from getting near the scene and ordered photographers 
not to take pictures 
speaking of mothopeng bishop stanley mogoba leader of south 
africas methodist church said although he was sickly he was 
morally tough and had a clear vision on what was unfolding in the 
political arena still intending to contribute to the liberation 
struggle 
in recent years the pan africanist congress struggle has been 
largely ineffective it is overshadowed by the much larger and more 
moderate anc which is involved in talks with the government aimed 
at sharing power between blacks and whites the pan africanist 
congress opposed the talks 
some 35 miles to the north about 2000 rightwing conservative 
party supporters marched through pretoria to demand that whites 
vote on president fw de klerks efforts to end apartheid 
conservative leader andries treurnicht chided de klerk for 
talking to the anc saying he is the only western leader 
negotiating himself and his party from power 
the conservative party favors strict segregation and contends de 
klerk has acted without the support of a majority of whites 
no violence was reported 
earlier saturday two bombs exploded near dawn in the orange 
free state city of bloemfontain about 210 miles southwest of 
johannesburg 
police said the two blasts about an hour apart damaged rail 
lines and halted commuter traffic but caused no injuries no group 
or individuals claimed responsibility 
the anc said its regional conference began saturday in 
bloemfontain and a spokesman suggested that rightwing elements 
may have set the bombs to try to disrupt it 
a police spokeswoman said a train full of police had been 
scheduled to travel on the damaged lines at about the time the 
explosions occurred she said the police trip had been canceled 
previously 
extreme rightwing groups have been accused of other bombings of 
anc and government targets

a note written by a disturbed 
passenger delayed a united airlines flight for two hours while the 
jet was evacuated so fbi agents and bombsniffing dogs could search 
the plane officials said 
thirty passengers were evacuated friday from the chicagobound 
plane after the note was mistakenly interpreted as a bomb threat 
it wasnt a threat said art kollias airport operations 
manager if anything it was a misunderstanding 
kollias said an elderly immigrant with a history of mental 
illness wrote the note to express a concern for his personal safety 
to the flight crew 
the note was written in broken english and included the word 
sabotage so the crew thought it was a threat he said 
authorities did not identify the man or release the full 
contents of the letter the flight originated in cedar rapids 
the other 28 passengers flew to chicago after the plane was 
checked and no bombs were found the passenger and his companion 
were questioned by the fbi and later released

disgruntled voters pick a new congress and 36 governors tuesday 
in midterm elections shadowed by twin threats of recession at home 
and war in the middle east 
but for all the combustible ingredients and unexpectedly close 
races involving republican sens jesse helms mark hatfield and 
rudy boschwitz few incumbents seem likely to lose in 34 senate 
races 435 house contests and 36 statehouse races on the ballot 
and only marginal changes seem likely in the size of democratic 
majorities in congress and among the nations governors 
the california governors race is the biggest prize of the 
campaign season pitting republican sen pete wilson against former 
san francisco mayor dianne feinstein in a 35 million contest 
the nations most populous state is expected to gain as many as 
seven house seats after the 1990 census and the new governor will 
share power with the democraticcontrolled legislature in deciding 
the makeup of the new congressional districts 
other closely watched gubernatorial campaigns are in texas 
where republican clayton williams was in a close race with democrat 
ann richards and florida where late polls had former sen lawton 
chiles leading gop gov bob martinez 
not on the ballot but scarcely ever on the sidelines this fall 
has been president bush 
he campaigned for more than 80 gop candidates but triggered a 
period of republican disillusionment when he flipflopped on tax 
increases during budget negotiations with congress and abandoned 
his 1988 pledge of no new taxes 
there was no shortage of campaigning the final weekend before 
election day 
bush stumped in california for wilson whom he praised as an 
environmentalist and credited with a big part in our decision 
to impose a 10year moratorium on offshore oil drilling off the 
california coast feinstein campaigned by train through the san 
joaquin valley 
in oregon democrat harry lonsdale crashed hatfields news 
conference and issued one more call for a debate hatfield made no 
response but later told reporters im conducting a press 
conference not a circus 
helms sought to strip his race to its essentials the real 
question is do you want liberal harvey gantt or conservative jesse 
helms to cast your vote in the senate and thats the question the 
people of north carolina have to ask he said 
gantt a black man trying to unhorse one of the senates 
bestknown conservatives referred to the desegreation battles in 
the 1960s as he appealed for votes he said he sees a need to build 
bridges of understanding because people are in danger of drifting 
back to overt racism 
an estimated 19 house seats will migrate from states in the 
industrial northeast and midwest to the sun belt before the 1992 
elections elevating interest in this years legislative races and 
raising the stakes in the gubernatorial battleground states 
an estimated 1 million has been spent by two candidates for a 
state legislative seat in pennsylvania where democrats hope to 
take control of the senate and monopolize the states 
reapportionment process 
more than 6100 legislative seats are up for election around the 
country voters in 43 states and the district of columbia will 
decide 236 ballot questions including big green an 
environmentalistbacked measure in california 
you could have the contradictory result of overwhelming public 
anger toward the people in government and a very high reelection 
percentage of incumbents says larry mccarthy a gop consultant 
active in campaigns from florida to california 
mccarthy says polling indicates that upwards of twothirds of 
the voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction 
and others say the level of antipathy toward incumbents is 
extraordinarily high 
says paul tully political director at the democratic national 
committee when weve seen voters get more nervous more anxious 
they grab for stability and vote for the incumbent candidate 
california aside all eyes are on these races 
north carolinas senate seat where gantt is locked in a close 
race with helms helms is running a latecampaign commercial 
showing a white worker with a job rejection letter a reference to 
the civil rights bill that helms opposed and bush vetoed with a 
claim it would lead to hiring quotas 
the texas governors race a 33 million battle between wealthy 
oilman williams and richards thats close in the preelection 
polls williams disclosed friday he had paid no income taxes for 
1986 when our whole economy collapsed 
minnesotas tumultuous gubernatorial campaign where republican 
jon grunseth dropped out of the race in late october over 
allegations that he had once gone swimming nude with teenage 
girls and had an affair during both of his marriages after days 
of bickering a state party dominated by conservatives turned to 
moderate arne carlson the gop still has realistic hopes of ousting

in the house democrats hope to pick up as many as 10 or 12 
seats and pad their 259176 majority but with the exception of 
incumbents tinged by the savings and loan crisis such as 
republican alfred mccandless in california or personal scandal 
such as arlan stangeland in minnesota relatively few incumbents 
seem to be in serious difficulty 
the most competitive races are for the 18 republican and 11 
democratic seats without incumbents 
a small group of potential 1992 democratic presidential 
candidates is on the ballot gov mario cuomo of new york and sens 
sam nunn of georgia al gore of tennessee and bill bradley of new 
jersey are all favored to run up landslide reelection victories 
as always the two sides harbor hopes of lateblooming upsets 
democrats claimed a surge in kentucky where harvey sloane is 
running against gop sen mitch mcconnell republicans hoped to 
surprise democratic sen john kerry in massachusetts 
but after months of campaigning hundreds of millions of dollars 
in expenditures and seemingly endless negative campaign 
commercials there seems little likelihood of antiincumbency fever 
sweeping the nation 
democrats quickly portrayed themselves as the party of tax 
fairness and republicans as protectors of the rich during the 
october budget debate and the party benefited in preelection 
polling 
but lately bush has helped shift the campaign focus away from 
the budget and softening economy and toward the persian gulf where 
he has deployed more than 200000 american troops as a bulwark 
against iraqs saddam hussein the result has been an apparent 
shift back to some gop candidates 
abortion is playing a role at the end of a tight florida 
gubernatorial race chiles stayed away from the issue until a 
debate last monday night in which he said he would trust the 
women of florida to make their own choice martinez is a foe of 
abortion 
polls in two states favor independent candidates over major 
party rivals for governor former gop sen lowell weicker is 
seeking a political comeback in connecticut and former gop gov 
wally hickel in alaska 
illinois ohio and massachusetts are among 13 states where no 
incumbent is on the ballot 
one incumbent whose defeat seems certain is rhode island 
republican gov edward diprete lagging far behind in the polls in 
a thirdtime rematch with democrat bruce sundlun 
the fallout from the minnesota governors race has settled on 
veteran gop sen boschwitz locked in a tight race with liberal 
democrat paul wellstone 
the other endangered republican is hatfield of oregon a veteran 
of 40 years of politics democrat harry lonsdale has depicted him 
as a washington elitist out of touch with his state hatfield 
fought back with advertisements recalling lonsdales supportive 
comments in the mid1980s of an indian guru whose top aide was 
convicted of arson and poisoning 
the lone democratic incumbent in difficulty appears to be sen 
daniel akaka in hawaii appointed after the death of spark 
matsunaga earlier this year republicans hope rep patricia saiki 
can win the seat and offset any losses elsewhere the democrats 
hold a 5545 edge in the senate 
gop candidates are favored to retain all three open senate seats 
on the ballot reps hank brown in colorado larry craig in idaho 
and bob smith in new hampshire 
gop veteran strom thurmond of south carolina who will be 88 
when his new term starts has no major party opposition democrat 
j bennett johnston won election earlier this fall in louisianas 
unique open primary system 
democratic freshman sen paul simon is favored to win 
reelection in illinois and sen tom harkin is favored less 
securely in iowa 
in house races of interest three blacks are running competitive 
races as republicans gary franks in connecticut former cincinnati 
mayor kenneth blackwell in ohio and al brown in kentucky

the lady of the lake mystery appears 
to be solved with the identification of skeletal remains inside a 
ford sedan hauled from the bottom of lake lanier officials said 
saturday 
fulton county medical examiner gerald gowitt examined the 
remains and said the bones and a skull apparently belonged to susie 
roberts who drove off in a car with a friend in 1958 and never 
returned 
gowitt declared that the bones were those of mrs roberts using 
her approximate weight and height a more positive identification 
was unlikely he said 
with the evidence we have were as certain as we can be he 
said 
the rusted car was found thursday in the northeast georgia lake 
by workers building a bridge the light blue car was mangled by 
construction equipment that dug it up but its tires were still 
inflated authorities said 
workers washed mud out of the car when they came across the 
remains said hall county sheriff dick mecum 
the car had a 1958 license plate corresponding with the womans 
disappearance mecum said 
a car carrying two women ran off the road into the lake in 1958 
the body of a woman believed to have been one of the occupants was 
found about a year later but the car and the other woman werent 
recovered mecum said 
we were pretty sure it was her hugh roberts 49 said 
saturday its sad but its a relief to know 
roberts one of mrs roberts sons and his brother james 
roberts 51 both of gainesville were teenagers when their mother 
disappeared she was 38 
the cars license plate was registered to mrs roberts her 
older son said his sister found evidence friday in county archives 
that matched the license plate he said 
investigators found a watch stopped at 1130 about the time 
the two women are believed to have been driving home from a dance 
in nearby dawsonville 
we believed she was in the lake but then we heard she might 
be in chicago then in florida the younger roberts said we 
wondered if she survived but had amnesia and never knew where to 
go 
authorities now believe a womans body found near the bridge 
about a year after the accident is that of delia mae parker young 
mrs roberts companion in the car the decomposed body was buried 
unidentified in the 1970s said john ward whose family mortuary 
kept the remains about 20 years in the hope someone would identify 
her 
hugh roberts said the family will hold a memorial service for 
his mother but he said details had not been finalized

rwandas army commander was quoted by 
ugandan newspapers saturday as saying the leader of an 
antigovernment insurgency has been wounded but rebel officials 
said he had been killed 
a statement from the rebel rwandan patriotic front said leader 
fred rwigyema died after stepping on a mine oct 2 the second day 
of the invasion 
rwanda on thursday claimed to have defeated the rebels in heavy 
fighting in the nations northeast the rwandan government said it 
had pushed the insurgents back into uganda 
however henry rwigyemera a local official near ugandas 
southern border with rwanda said in an interview that no rebels 
had returned to uganda since rwanda claimed victory he described 
such claims as lies and propaganda 
rebel representatives in brussels said on condition of anonymity 
that the news of rwigyemas death was kept secret for fear of 
lowering the morale of the guerrillas 
but ugandan newspapers reported saturday that rwigyema was 
seriously wounded during a helicopter attack on rebel forces and 
was taken to the united states 
the newspapers quoting rwandan army commander lt col 
deogratius ndabimana did not describe rwigyemas injuries or say 
when or where he was injured the reports in the star and munno 
newspapers also did not say who evacuated rwigyema a former 
ugandan deputy army commander or where he was taken in the united 
states 
officials at the us embassy in kampala uganda could not be 
reached for comment 
in washington us officials said they could not confirm 
whether rwigyema was dead or alive they also denied on condition 
of anonymity that rwigyema had been brought to the united states 
for treatment 
the insurgents said rwigyema was killed in the northeastern 
region around kagitumba near the ugandan border the rebels have a 
base camp in the area 
the front also announced two other rebel leaders were killed by 
a land mine on oct 23 the statement did not say who was currently 
leading the insurgents 
the rebels said they still controlled the kagera national park 
in the north which makes up about 15 percent of rwandas 
territory despite the government claims it has driven the 
insurgents out 
the front said it was ready to talk with the government about 
the future of rwanda a former belgian protectorate but the rebels 
said they could still launch attacks 
last week the belgian government said it had negotiated a 
ceasefire between the government troops and the rebels but the 
truce has yet to become effective 
belgium and france sent paratroopers to rwanda to protect their 
nationals after the insurgency began belgiums last paratroopers 
returned saturday 
rwigyema who was 34 was a major general in ugandas army 
before leading the invasion of rwanda by several thousand refugees 
mainly of rwandas minority tutsi tribe 
the rebels accused rwandas government of corruption they said 
they wanted to replace it with a democracy in which all ethnic 
parties could participate 
they sprang from the hundreds of thousands of tutsis including 
rwigyema who fled rwanda in the late 1950s and early 1960s in 
those years the majority hutu gained control in a power struggle 
that left more than 10000 tutsi dead

public relations drive to improve the countrys tarnished image 
abroad official reports said saturday 
they discussed how to better present china to the rest of the 
world under the present situation the official xinhua news 
agency said 
it apparently was referring to lingering criticism of the 
chinese army attack in june 1989 on studentled demonstrators for 
democratic reform although the industrialized democracies have 
begun softening sanctions against china foreign tourism and 
investment remains down 
five of the six members of the communist partys powerful 
standing committee took up the imagebuilding issue at a 
closeddoor meeting at the great hall of the people with delegates 
from around the country

xinhua said standing committee members song ping and qiao shi 
also met with delegates at the fiveday meeting on overseas 
publicity the report did not mention yao yilin the other member 
of the partys top decisionmaking committee 
the delegates agreed that in view of the situation more 
efforts should be made to better present china to the rest of the 
world in order to acquaint people more with the country and thereby 
increase their understanding xinhua said 
they all agreed that foreigners and overseas chinese are very 
different from people in china in lifestyle way of thinking and 
expression as they live in different societies therefore 
they agreed these characteristics need serious studies and should 
be dealt with differently domestic methods should not be simply 
copied 
the delegates said chinese from all walks of life must help 
project a favorable image to the rest of the world 
the work of overseas publicity should be done not only by the 
press people but also by those engaged in economics foreign 
trade science and technology culture education and tourism 
xinhua quoted the delegates as saying in addition leaders at 
all levels and in all departments concerned should attach great 
importance to this work and place it on their daily agenda 
in a separate development a taiwan magazine reported that 
senior chinese leader deng xiaoping extended a hand to taiwan 
earlier this year by meeting with a member of the countrys 
nationalist party 
it would be the first time that a chinese leader was reported to 
meet a member of the party since the chinese communist revolution 
in 1949

teng wenyi a former aide to taiwans generalissimo chiang 
kaishek and a former classmate of deng chiang was defeated by the 
communists and he fled with nationalist forces to taiwan 
the respected magazine ran a photograph of the two men shaking 
hands

darwin and phyllis michael thought they 
were safe when 10 inches of rain fell in the mountains near their 
home five years ago their house was 27 feet above and 600 feet 
away from the south branch river 
but their home was demolished when the south branch and several 
other rivers in eastern west virginia overflowed their banks on 
nov 4 1985 the recordbreaking floods killed 47 people and 
caused 570 million in damage 
the michaels knew they were in trouble when the water began 
gushing into the secondfloor bedroom of their home in petersburg 
60 miles east of parsons they wound up riding their attic like a 
raft and spent the night clinging to the limbs of a walnut tree 
at dawn the next day they found themselves 200 yards from what 
used to be their home there was nothing left the bricks were 
gone the cinderblock foundation was gone the concrete slab the 
house sat on was gone 
it even pulled the footers out of the ground darwin michael 
said still amazed at the force of the water 
five years havent erased the memory of the flood for area 
residents 
the flood is still very much on their minds its still a 
topic of discussion every day said ron castle a parsons 
businessman whose television and appliance store was gutted 
the flood came after nightfall with little warning 
the water poured down the narrow valleys with brutal force 
twisting railroad tracks into corkscrews and scouring farmland 
trees automobiles buildings and bridges were washed away the 
debris battered homes and businesses to pieces 
more than 3500 homes and 180 businesses were destroyed and 
hundreds of thousands of farm animals were killed fortythree 
bridges were destroyed and 80 more were damaged 
the areas economy is still hurting from the flood most 
business owners had no flood insurance and were forced to take out 
federal small business administration disaster relief loans 
jane barb 57 owns a drug store and four rental properties in 
parsons and estimates her debt at more than 200000 
the sba owns me lock stock and barrel barb said i will 
never live to get out of debt everything i have is mortgaged to 
the hilt 
shes among the success stories 
marywin mcclain smith editor of the weekly newspaper the 
parsons advocate says just 13 of 96 businesses in the parsons area 
escaped damage in the flood 
since then 18 businesses in town either failed to reopen after 
the flood or opened only to close again among the casualties were 
the only two downtown department stores 
her husband george smith said at least two other businesses 
are in trouble because of the flood and disaster relief loans 
made more with the heart than with the head 
the michaels used their life savings and some volunteer help to 
build a replica of their house 
but this time they built on a hill 700 feet above the river and 
a mile and a half away from it 
the michaels are still working on their house 
people will be working for 10 years said tucker county 
clerk nina buchanan buchanan said she was still working on her own 
home in parsons 
work also continues on public buildings and other structures 
damaged by the flooding 
steve simpson state public assistance officer for the office of 
emergency services says the federal emergency management agency 
has provided 62 million to rebuild roads bridges water plants 
and sewer systems about 16 million in work remains undone 
while the rebuilding continues many flood survivors also must 
cope with the fear that floods will come again 
many report being drawn to the riverside during heavy rains as 
if standing there will hold the water in its banks 
i do it myself said frank brown director of the potomac 
highlands guild mental health center in petersburg i dont mind 
a hard rain but by the second day i start looking people are

president bush declared at a campaign 
rally saturday that the united states will stand firm against iraq 
until every hostage is returned home 
the united states is united and we will prevail he said 
if the united states cant do it nobody can 
shouting at times to be heard over a group of about 20 antiwar 
protestors the president referred to his plans to visit the middle 
east over the thanksgiving holidays 
barbara and i have a lot to be thankful for he said and 
we will be with those troops on thanksgiving day and i will give 
them the thanks of everybody here and all the american people 
bushs brief appearance in a chilly airport hanger in 
albuquerque was on behalf of gubernatorial candidate frank bond and 
other new mexico gop candidates 
his preelection campaign day had started earlier in california 
where he pledged to sign a landmark bill that would usher in a 
new era for clean air 
at the same time bush voiced opposition to a sweeping 
environmental measure known as big green on the california 
ballot that would curb use of pesticides and chemicals 
when it comes to the environment in order to keep our 
environment green we dont have to be big green bush said 
noting that gop sen pete wilson in a tight race for governor of 
california also opposes the measure 
the controversial ballot proposition supported widely by 
environmental organizations would phase out cancercausing 
pesticides ban ozonedepleting chemicals and reduce gaseous 
emissions that contribute to global warming among other 
provisions 
the measure is opposed by water timber agricultural and 
manufacturing industries 
bushs environmental protection agency chief william reilly 
later said he did not have a public position on big green he told 
reporters it has some laudable provisions but he also cited its 
costs and said it is not sound scientifically 
obviously its goals are laudable it reflects a very high 
degree of concern a sense of urgency that people feel about 
the environment reilly said 
if big green does pass we will work with it to try to ensure 
that it is integrated with our national laws as effectively as 
possible reilly added 
the president was flying on to houston later saturday night and 
was to spend sunday and monday and part of tuesday election day 
in his adoptive home state of texas before flying back to 
washington 
in remarks at a rally for wilson on the california lutheran 
university campus bush also said he was looking forward to 
visiting the troops in the persian gulf when he travels there over 
thanksgiving 
he used a treeplanting ceremony at the university to highlight 
the historic clean air act of 1990 which he promised to sign 
we are on the verge of a major domestic achievement for all 
americans and i can now say to californians is that i will sign 
this landmark clean air legislation as soon as it gets to my desk 
within the next few days bush said 
bush called the legislation which would stem acid rain urban 
smog and toxic industrial pollution the most significant air 
pollution legislation in the history of this country 
we are on the verge of a new era for clean air he said 
referring to the bills requirement for a phasein of vehicles 
that run on alternative fuels bush said in a short time since we 
issued the clean air challenge weve seen a revolution in thinking 
about alternative fuels the time is right the people are ready 
and industry is responding 
the clean air act represents the product of a years worth of 
technical negotiations by administration and congressional 
representatives 
it marks the first passage of major antipollution regulations 
in 13 years 
environmental groups have lauded the bill despite the fact that 
the final version discarded tougher provisions particularly in the 
area of auto emissions that they had pushed 
they expressed satisfaction with the bill overall after accusing 
the bush administration of blocking some of the tougher provisions 
that had won strong support in the senate 
wilson has developed a strong enough environmental record to win 
the endorsement of some environmental groups in his race against 
democrat dianne feinstein he has been a strong advocate of coastal 
protection bucking both the reagan and bush administrations and 
also has backed protection of scenic rivers wilson opposes big 
green 
feinstein who supports the initiative had less of a clear 
record on the environment as a mayor of san francisco

republican gubernatorial candidate 
clayton williams on saturday defended his admission that he paid no 
income taxes for 1986 while his democratic opponent continued to 
call upon him to release his tax records 
williams described 1986 as a lean year for many texans yet one 
in which his democratic rival state treasurer ann richards drew 
a fat government paycheck 
meanwhile a poll published in sundays editions of the houston 
chronicle showed richards gaining ground on williams as the 
campaign nears its end 
the poll showed williams was favored by 44 percent of those 
surveyed while 39 percent backed richards thirteen percent were 
undecided and 3 percent backed other candidates 
the oct 2830 poll by the university of houstons center for 
public policy surveyed 767 of 1042 likely voters who had been 
interviewed for a chronicle poll in september 
the earlier poll showed williams favored by 48 percent and 
richards by 33 percent both surveys had a 4 percentage point 
margin of error 
richards campaigning in brownsville said she could not predict 
who would win the election but said her continued gains in the 
polls was an encouraging sign 
i cant call this election and i think its going to be real 
real close but i think hes got real serious problems richards 
said 
williams campaigning in harlingon on saturday said richards 
didnt understand the hard times many texans suffered during 1986 
im just bothered that somebody who was drawing a fat 
government paycheck sitting in austin in 1986 was hiding under 
that rock he said 
williams a millionaire whose business interests include oil and 
ranching on friday disclosed that he paid no taxes in 1986 when 
our whole economy collapsed 
i didnt get a paycheck in 1986 because i was trying to keep 
my business afloat trying to pay interest on bank loans and trying 
to survive he said 
richards then renewed her call for williams to release his 
income tax returns and said i paid my income tax in 1986 how 
about you 
her press secretary bill cryer said in 1986 i can 
understand he was going through some hard times but everybody in 
texas was and we all paid our taxes then 
reggie bashur a williams spokesman said williams had complied 
with tax laws and i dont think the people of the state of texas 
care to see his tax returns 
williams and republican sen phil gramm criticized richards for 
making an issue of williams tax returns 
ann richards has discovered miraculously that 1986 was a bad 
year that clayton williams and the oil business lost money in 
1986 gramm said what rock has she been hiding under 
williams also reiterated his call for a constitutional amendment 
that would ban a state income tax unless voters supported the tax 
in a referendum he said he would veto a state income tax and 
criticized richards for refusing to say whether she also would veto 
one

the royal shakespeare company which had two smash 
hits with les miserables and nicholas nickleby called its 
curtains in london on saturday in a costcutting move highlighting 
tough times for the british arts 
following its sellout evening performance of the play 
singer the company closed its two london theaters at the 
barbican center until march 1991 it will continue its season in 
two theaters at stratforduponavon shakespeares birthplace 
with your help and god willing well be back the companys 
artistic director terry hands told the barbican audience 
it was the first time the statesubsidized company has taken 
such a step the event was greeted with a mixture of sadness as 
well as applause for the companys determination 
lets lift a glass to if you like the future and our 
return hands told the audience before they went out to the lobby 
to join cast members for one last drink in london this year 
the move is expected to save 253 million for the company now 
585 million in debt 
the company is the largest of many theater organizations around 
britain to be fighting for survival in todays costcutting 
recessionary climate 
on monday vanessa redgrave glenda jackson and dame peggy 
ashcroft were among the british stars to launch a nationwide 
campaign at londons albery theatre to spotlight the financial woes 
of the theater industry nationwide 
the shakespeare company receives annual subsidies of 118 
million it says it needs 193 million to be in the black 
hands consistently argued that the companys grant has kept pace 
neither with inflation running at 109 percent nor with the 
specific recommendations of an independent report saying the 
company was underfunded 
annual worldwide revenue from the musical les miserables 
which opened at the barbican in october 1984 brings the company 
nearly 2 million a year but hands points out that the show wont 
run forever 
amid widespread sadness at the companys closure in london 
depriving the city of up to six plays is some speculation that 
the company has in part been its own worst enemy 
its case is not helped by espousing the palpably second 
rate david lister wrote in the independent of moscow gold 
the companys new play about soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
howard brenton and tariq alis play a satire with a cast of 33 
opened sept 26 to bad reviews and has performed poorly at the box 
offices 
moscow gold was one of three new company plays to receive 
blistering reviews in london this year only peter flannerys 
singer starring antony sher as a concentration camp survivor 
turned london slumlord won acclaim from critics and audiences 
playing to 99 percent capacity in the 1162seat main auditorium 
the company needs to look hard at its new play policy 
benedict nightingale wrote in the times of london he said 
defiantly uncommercial plays are not necessarily worthwhile and 
urged the company to take time for unromantic selfexamination 
in 1988 hands staging of the musical carrie was derisively 
received during its company tryout in stratforduponavon 
it subsequently closed on broadway afterfive performances even 
though the company made 420000 in a prearranged deal with 
producer friedrich kurz 
last year critic john peter in londons sunday times coined the 
name the really frightful company referring to the declining 
quality of shakespearean versespeaking 
but when the company is on target its productions equal the 
best to be found in the englishspeaking theater 
last season was highlighted by major revivals of shakespeares 
othello directed by trevor nunn and henrik ibsens the 
master builder starring john wood

the overseer of the nations 
medicare program ordered an investigation of florida health 
maintenance organizations with federal contracts to scrutinize 
marketing and patient practices 
richard kusserow inspector general for the health and human 
services department will conduct the investigation which was 
prompted by media reports of abuses and inquiries from two florida 
congressman 
much of the attention will focus on humana gold plus by far the 
states largest hmo for medicare beneficiaries 
the gold plus plan which has about 200000 clients has been 
the subject of 5440 complaints since june 1987 ranging from 
improper enrollments to failure to provide service 
the gold plus plan was cited twice last year by the health care 
financing administration medicares parent agency for violating 
medicare regulations including improperly denying claims 
enrollment problems and excessive payment delays 
gail r wilensky chief of the health care financing 
administration said friday she picked kusserow to investigate 
medicare placed a moratorium on humanas plans to expand into other 
parts of florida pending the outcome of the investigation 
other complaints against gold plus involved bills the plan did 
not pay or decisions that left patients harassed by bill 
collectors 
the government pays humana a fixed fee monthly for each 
enrollee patients are to receive complete health care services and 
prescription drugs at little or no cost and arent supposed to have 
to fill out insurance forms 
wilensky said she decided to launch the investigation after she 
was contacted by florida congressman e clay shaw jr and larry 
smith and learning of media reports about patients complaints about 
gold plus 
shaw and smith wanted to ensure hmos were following federal 
regulations she said 
humana spokesman tom noland dismissed the investigation as 
politically motivated he said he couldnt respond to medicares 
concerns because the organization has not received anything in 
writing 
if they ask us to do something how can we do it if we dont 
know what it is he said 
the hmos could lose their federal contracts to provide for 
medicare patients if the investigation uncovers wrongdoing other 
punitive action could be brought by congress

the national parliament has approved a 
new constitution that ends 15 years of oneparty rule eliminates 
the death penalty and changes the countrys name mozambiques news 
agency reported saturday 
the constitution takes effect at months end it meets key 
demands of the rebel mozambique national resistance which has been 
fighting the government for 13 years 
but the rebels released a statement saturday rejecting the 
document saying it reflects the ideology of the ruling frelimo 
party rather than the mozambique people and leaves too much power 
with the president 
the rebels proposed discussing revisions at peace talks expected 
to resume soon in rome their war with the government has killed 
600000 people and left about half the countrys 15 million people 
in need of donated food 
in its report the national news agency aim said all 181 
peoples assembly deputies present voted for the new constitution 
friday ending debate that began oct 5 
the document changes the countrys name to republic of 
mozambique dropping the word peoples in addition the 
parliaments name changes to assembly of the republic 
frelimos policymaking central committee had previously 
recommended the changes approval by the frelimodominated 
parliament had been expected 
frelimo has been the sole legal political party in the southeast 
african nation since mozambique gained independence from portugal 
in 1975 the frelimo party was marxist but it has undergone 
reforms in recent years and officially dropped its marxist label 
last year 
the new constitution removes all references to frelimos 
leading role in the country 
after the vote president joachim chissano led the assembly in 
singing songs from frelimos guerrilla war against portuguese 
colonial rule aim reported 
the new constitution permits formation of multiple political 
parties and calls for secret balloting in national elections which 
would be on a majority vote system rather than a proportional 
representation system 
a majority vote system means the top votegetter wins while a 
proportional system allocates parliamentary seats on the basis of 
the percentage of votes a party receives in presidential 
elections a candidate would have to gain at least half the votes 
to win a runoff would be held if no candidate received 50 percent 
the new constitution also prohibits political parties based on 
regional or ethnic ties and requires all parties to reect 
violence 
it guarantees press freedom including the right to set up 
newspapers workers right to strike an independent judiciary and 
the right to life which abolishes the death penalty 
chissano said july 31 he wanted a multiple party system in place 
for parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for next 
year he previously had opposed a multiparty system saying it 
would encourage tribalism and waste the countrys scarce resources

californias other big election issue is a proposition called 
big green a farranging package of environmental reforms it 
would ban offshore oildrilling and cancercausing pesticides 
reduce air pollution and create an elected post of state 
environmental czar another measure would restrict timber 
clearcutting and purchase 742 million worth of old redwood 
forests 
it will make california a far better a far safer place 
said albert meyerhoff an environmentalist who helped write big 
green 
the timber agricultural and chemical industriesdisagree 
saying the measures would cripple the economy they have countered 
with less drastic propositions of their own 
californians also will consider two propositions to limit the 
number of terms its state legislators can serve 
colorado too will vote on term limitations that proposal 
would not only limit state legislators the governor and other 
state officeholders to eight years in office but also would impose

grand jury testimony against charles keating 
jr brims with stories of pressure to sell junk bonds at lincoln 
savings branches bank examiners bamboozled and elderly people left 
broke 
keating headed the phoenixbased development company american 
continental corp which owned lincoln savings and loan 
association he is accused in civil suits of looting the thrift 
a grand jury indicted him on criminal fraud charges involving 
the sale of american continental junk bonds to lincoln depositors 
prosecutors say more than 17000 investors lost 250 million on the 
bonds the case focuses on 20 who lost 11 million 
echoing earlier congressional testimony an office of thrift 
supervision examiner said keating continued to have uninsured bonds 
sold at lincoln branches even though he knew the magnitude of 
lincolns problems 
if this institution is taken over you guys will be faced with 
a 2 billion loss the regulator alex barabolak quoted keating 
as telling him in october 1988 
lincoln was seized six months later a day after american 
continental sought bankruptcy protection rendering the junk bonds 
worthless 
douglas j lagerstrom a bond salesman for american continental 
was one of many employees who described how pressure to sell junk 
bonds began at the top he said the bond representatives were 
entertained by keating and his wife at the developers sumptuous 
resort 
lagerstrom said someone asked keating if he could imagine any 
way to make the place more beautiful 
i can put a bond office in front of it and sell bonds 
lagerstrom quoted keating as saying 
the hefty grand jury transcript unsealed friday totals 4600 
pages weighs 45 pounds and stands 2 feet high it includes 
testimony taken from 89 witnesses between april and september 
prosecutors got a 42count indictment against keating american 
continental president judy j wischer lincoln chief executive 
robin s symes and lincoln president ray c fidel 
keating 66 and the others pleaded innocent they remain free 
on bail 
fidels former secretary kathi richardson testified that while 
federal bank examiners checked company records in an 11thfloor 
office at lincolns irvine calif headquarters in 1986 
executives worked one floor below manufacturing documents to make 
lincoln look healthy 
i was told to keep the examiners as much as i could up on the 
11th floor so they wouldnt notice the activity going on on the 
10th floor she told the grand jury 
richardson said she helped wischer clean out documents from 
bond files to be examined by regulators in early 1986 the files 
lacked required underwriting summaries and when they arrived from 
phoenix secretaries typed underwriting papers for wischer to 
insert she testified 
richardson said the office joke was that no one could even move 
furniture without keatings ok she described fidel and keating as 
wary of leaving a paper trail 
mr keating doesnt like files richardson said she was 
told 
much of the testimony came from elderly investors who switched 
money from insured certificates of deposit at lincoln to the 
uninsured unsecured american continental bonds 
their plight more than anything has caused keating to become the 
central figure in the nations thrift debacle and what one of his 
lawyers called the most vilified man since richard nixon 
we trusted lincoln said 66yearold john brunner who lost 
76000 it was like going into your doctors office we trusted 
them

bigleague baseball owners agreed to pay players 
280 million in compensation for conspiring not to hire free agents 
after the 1985 1986 and 1987 seasons a leading agent said 
saturday 
the head of managements player relations committee and a union 
lawyer denied that a settlement had been reached 
richard moss former general counsel for the players union who 
represents several dozen players said the 26 clubs agreed to pay 
280 million to settle three collusion cases covering the three 
offseasons 
moss said 16 players including jack clark of the san diego 
padres jack morris of the detroit tigers and gary gaetti of the 
minnesota twins would be be granted newlook free agency as part 
of a settlement 
newlook free agency means a player has the option of keeping 
his current contract or leaving his team 
chuck oconnor head of the player relations committee said 
discussions had intensified but a deal had not been reached 
until everything is agreed to nothing is agreed to 
oconnor said 
union lawyer stephen fehr said it appears now that there is 
the possibility of a settlement but said it will probably be at 
least a month until it could be finalized 
a 280 million payment would amount to 10769230 for each of 
the clubs by far the largest payment ever made by teams to players 
in the history of sports 
after six seasons in the majors a player can become a free 
agent entertain offers from other clubs and sign with the team of 
his choice 
two arbitrators have ruled that owners suppressed salaries by 
boycotting free agents after the 1985 1986 and 1987 seasons they 
have awarded preliminary damages of 113 million but have not yet 
ruled on a variety of damage claims 
teams once again started signing free agents after the 1988 
season but the players union claims salaries are lower than they 
would have been without the boycott

greenpeace accused the department of energy 
of bypassing environmental review requirements on a south carolina 
plutonium processing plant 
greenpeace officials said the energy department failed to 
complete an environmental impact statement on the plant at the 
savannah river site where idled government nuclear operations are 
located 
the environmental group said it believed the government wanted 
the new plant to replace the safetytroubled rocky flats plant in 
colorado 
without any public discussion without an analysis of the 
environmental impact doe is taking the first step toward moving 
rocky flats to savannah river said stephen schwartz legislative 
coordinator for the greenpeace nuclear free future campaign 
the plant will undergo environmental reviews but they will be 
done later than usual said doe spokesman rick ford said such 
reviews required by law typically are done before construction is 
begun 
the thinking at the time was that this was an addition to an 
existing facility so the full environmental impact statement 
process was not needed ford said 
officials had not decided whether a full environmental report is 
needed ford said if a full report is not done the plant could 
begin operation in june 1991 he said 
the savannah river site near the georgia border produced 
tritium gas for nuclear weapons before its reactors were idled in 
1988 for doeordered safety upgrades 
the new plant had been under construction for seven years 
plutonium scrap would be dissolved into weaponsgrade plutonium and 
the purified scrap made into metal buttons to store for future use 
this gives us the capability to handle scrap that has 
accumulated over the years that we havent previously been able to 
handle ford said 
theenergy department has acknowledged it is considering closing 
rocky flats and transfering some of its operations to savannah 
river but the new plant couldnt replace rocky flats because it 
couldnt handle the same volume
