four democratic state legislators 
announced monday that they were switching to the republican party 
earning them praise from president bush 
state reps frank ely alvin endt danny guice and curtis 
holston jr told reporters they had considered the change for about 
a year 
im not leaving the democrats they left me long ago endt 
said 
my thoughts are conservative and being associated with the 
republican party is being associated with the more conservative 
political party he said 
the four were accompanied at news conferences in pascagoula and 
jackson by ron farris of the state gop farris read a letter from 
bush who lauded the lawmakers for their tremendous courage in 
switching allegiances 
ely said he feels more like a republican than a democrat 
my philosophy is more along the lines of the republican party 
i feel that the democrats left me he said 
the four are up for reelection in november 1991 and said they 
decided to go public with their switch in plenty of time for 
constituents to make up their minds 
since november 1988 more than 65 elected democrats in 
mississippi have switched to the gop 
ely who was elected to the legislature in 1984 said many of 
his constituents had called to tell him they were happy about his 
decision to switch i havent had the first negative response 
he said 
guice said he decided to become a republican because he felt 
state and national democratic leaders are too liberal 
i realized that ive been supporting republicans for some time 
now said guice who was elected to the mississippi house in 1983 
guice said the gop did not court the four 
holston who was elected in 1983 said he identifies more with 
the republican party he said he doesnt expect resistance from the 
people who voted him into office 
i think the majority will be pleased to see that im joining 
the republican party holston said the feeling of my area has 
changed toward republicans since i was originally elected as a 
democrat

anderson county sheriff gene taylor was 
only looking to catch drug dealers when he erected billboards 
promising to pay informants instead hes caught flak from his 
critics and a 40 million lawsuit 
billboards around the county which read need cash turn in a 
drug dealer wrongly lure ordinary citizens into dangerous 
undercover law enforcement say detractors of the anderson county 
sheriff 
under taylors twomonthold operation roll over drug 
buyers or confidential informants are paid as much as 25 percent of 
the assets seized from any dealer they help arrest those who 
testify in court are paid more 
this isnt for the little old lady down the street 
necessarily said taylor a former television reporter elected in 
january 1989 
anderson county population 150000 is on lake hartwell in 
northwestern south carolina its textile hightech and 
automobilerelated industries have attracted people to the area 
investigators have received about 10 calls a day since the first 
billboard was erected in february most callers offer information 
but refuse to testify in court said capt john skipper of the 
sheriffs investigative unit 
the number of drugrelated arrests five to 10 a week has not 
increased much since the program began but it is too soon to 
measure the programs success said chief deputy mike temple 
deputies have seized several vehicles and several thousand 
dollars from suspected dealers since the billboards were erected 
temple said 
he declined to release arrest figures until the program ends 
but wouldnt say when that will be well stop the program when 
it looks like those that are interested are played out temple 
said 
the billboard program was patterned after one used by the us 
customs service all we did was make it a little more widely 
known that it can be done taylor said 
the drug dealers seem to be noticing the sheriff says the 
word is filtering back to us now from the street that people are a 
little more cautious selling taylor said 
but all is not well with the billboard program 
an informant robin m pickens filed a 40 million lawsuit last 
month alleging she received a fraction of the money promised her 
she also charged that the sheriff failed to pay on the mortgage on 
her house as promised 
taylor said ms pickens whose testimony led to the conviction 
of a cocaine trafficker was paid 3000 he denied promising to 
make her house payments 
ms pickens attorney james b king said he could not discuss 
the pending case but he said operation roll over exemplifies 
taylors lack of experience in law enforcement 
king also said taylor was not using informants properly within 
the law 
informants are one thing but actually going out there and 
inducing people and recruiting them with the allure of cash is 
another he said he seems to have an apparent lack of concern 
for basic constitutional rights 
taylor raised eyebrows in may 1989 when he announced plans to 
erect narcotics checkpoints civil libertarians said the 
checkpoints violated constitutional protection against unreasonable 
searches 
taylor said he wasnt certain about constitutional implications 
but state attorney general travis medlock said in october that 
authorities could use any recognized weapon which is effective in 
the war against drugs 
taylor said the first checkpoints netted a halfdozen arrests 
and more checkpoints are planned 
he also has been criticized for inviting reporters to watch the 
arrest of 10 people in february 1989 on charges of selling 
counterfeit cassette tapes at a flea market eventually all charges 
were dropped

hundreds of soviet jews the last group 
to pass through this gateway to america celebrated a passover 
dinner together in an atmosphere of joy and expectancy 
its the beginning of a new life said sovietborn rabbi 
hirsch rabiski who led monday evenings traditional seder 
the approximately 7800 soviet jews staying in the ladispoli 
area near rome are all to be resettled in the united states or 
other countries by late may 
their departure marks the end of an era in which nearly all 
soviet jews bound for the united states lived in this seaside area 
their applications handled at the main us processing center in 
rome over time ladispoli became a symbol of the hope and despair 
of soviet jewish refugees 
now the us government is handling the refugees applications 
in moscow instead of rome 
most of the arrivals in ladispoli learned little about their 
faith and culture in the officially atheist soviet union even 
though they were often persecuted for being jews monday evenings 
ceremony in a blueandwhite tent was the first seder for many 
samuel dropkin 39 was determined to get it right 
the electrical engineer carefully studied a manual in hebrew and 
russian illustrating how to prepare for the passover meal 
aided by his 7yearold daughter jane im not jana any 
more he stacked three matzo on the table covered them with a 
paper napkin and added a hardboiled egg some lettuce a slice of 
onion and a dab of horseradish 
i really feel as a jew he beamed 
during the passover meal held on the first evening of the 
holiday jews eat foods symbolizing themes of redemption and 
freedom and read from the hagada of the jews flight from egypt 
the holiday commemorating that exodus is among the most important 
for jews 
dropkin from the city of baku in azerbaijan waved a hand at 
the approximately 600 people sitting at tables piled with passover 
foods 
this picture in the soviet union is impossible he said in 
broken english this is a pleasure for us we join with our 
people 
on a stage in front of the tables rabbi rabiski patiently 
explained the meaning of the ceremony and led prayers in russian 
following his example hundreds of people stood and filled plastic 
cups with sweet lambrusco wine the first of four glasses to be 
drunk during the passover ceremony 
this is very difficult for us its the first time said 
vitaly shlimack 20 of baku at a table with his parents and the 
dropkins 
i know the jewish history but very very bad i know the 
tradition but very very bad 
only the words in our passports made us jews we had no 
culture no language no tradition nothing 
while they are in ladispoli the soviets receive religious 
instruction from jewish groups in addition to help with housing 
money and language lessons 
two usbased jewish groups the american joint distribution 
committee and the lubavitch organization sponsored mondays seder 
in the tent 
several other smaller seders were held in ladispoli and nearby 
towns with 10 rabbis flying in from the united states to help out 
most of the soviet jews have received their visas and are 
awaiting transportation arrangements medical clearance or 
confirmation that they had been matched with sponsors 
the refugees at the ladispoli tent spoke nervously about their 
new homes and the state of their english but they were thrilled 
about being able to freely practice their faith 
i am going to learn every jewish holiday here or in 
america said felix kopylenko 30 of kiev who is headed for 
chicago on april 19 he wore his baby daughters white knit cap 
because he didnt own a yarmulka or jewish skullcap 
the passover ceremony appeared to remind some of the soviet jews 
of their own flight from their homeland 
dropkin said he had been denied work and educational 
opportunities in the soviet union because he was a jew and i had 
enough 
now its very well he said brightening now its a 
celebration

as moves gather pace to restart the 
angolan peace process jonas savimbis usbacked unita rebels are 
tempting angolas marxist government with some concessions 
the rebels are offering an immediate ceasefire and conditional 
recognition of the angolan state 
the concessions announced in a statement released in lisbon on 
monday and signed by savimbi and other topranking rebel officials 
have plenty of strings attached but they could overcome an impasse 
that has thwarted peace efforts since a shaky first truce collapsed 
last summer 
they are being offered after three months of what is said to be 
the heaviest fighting in the war so far and steppedup unita bomb 
attacks in the capital luanda 
according to the statement the rebels are ready to cease 
hostilities immediately and without preconditions and would 
recognize the angolan state on the basis of accords signed before 
independence from portugal in 1975 
there was no immediate reaction from angolan government 
officials 
but while offering an immediate ceasefire in the field the 
statement said unita was determined to act with more aggression 
in luanda until a truce is sealed 
if there is no peace well hit where it hurts most the 
statement said 
the national union for the total independence of angola unita 
previously conditioned talks on a government troop withdrawal from 
positions captured in rebel heartlands in southeast angola unita 
also always had refused even to mention the possibility of 
recognition under any circumstances 
the alvor accords signed in january 1975 by unita the popular 
movement for the liberation of angola mpla government and a third 
guerrilla movement the fnla set angolan independence for november 
of that year after an interim powersharing government had been 
formed by the three parties 
but fighting broke out shortly afterward and intervention by 
the united states the soviet union cuba and south africa 
escalated the conflict to its present heights unita receives a 
reported 50 million or more in us aid annually and western 
estimates of soviet backing to luanda run much higher 
by agreeing to recognize the angolan state albeit under the 
alvor terms that dont guarantee mpla authority unita is aiming to 
persuade luanda moderates they can reopen talks without losing face 
as an extra sweetener the rebels also pledged to respect all 
accords signed over the past 15 years by the mpla government 
once free and fair elections were held in angola 
government hardliners cheered by recent military successes 
are still insisting on full recognition of the mplas singleparty 
authority and state institutions 
luandas rapid military advance in late december led to the 
capture of the strategic mavinga air base in the southeast but the 
offense has been halted mainly due to faltering food fuel and 
ammunition supplies 
also the rebels have made good promises to step up hitand run 
bush war and urban guerrilla attacks lending weight to moderates 
arguments that the conflict can only be ended by talks 
both sides are now proposing direct talks western diplomats in 
lisbon and luanda say the government prefers cape verde as a venue 
but the rebels proposed direct closeddoor contacts in lisbon 
stressing that portugal can play a pivotal role among angolans of 
all political sensibilities 
the centerright portuguese government has kept close relations 
with luanda while allowing unita to maintain a major 
representation office in lisbon that the rebels have recently 
upgraded 
but unita foreign affairs secretary toni da costa fernandes 
reaffirmed in an interview on portuguese rtp state television late 
monday that the rebels would still back president mobutu sese seko 
of zaire as mediator until a truce is agreed 
the rebel statement also suggested the superpowers play a more 
active role in finding a speedy solution

in this little desert town where the 
greyhound depot consists of two worn chairs at the corner gas 
station its a welcome sight when the bus rolls in from points 
beyond the sagebrush horizon 
burns however hasnt seen a bus since march 2 when 9000 
greyhound drivers maintenance workers and others went on strike 
on monday greyhound filed a 30 million lawsuit accusing strikers 
of using violence to disrupt bus travel 
while greyhound has hired new drivers to restore service between 
the nations major cities it has delayed resuming less profitable 
runs to hundreds of remote spots like burns and some say the 
company may use the strike to abandon such routes permanently 
the loss makes this isolated town seem even more isolated 
with 2765 residents burns is the largest town in southeastern 
oregons lonely high desert no trains run here and the closest 
airport with scheduled flights is in bend a twohour drive to the 
west 
when the bus stops running you dont go to somebody else 
said carol graves local greyhound depot agent theres nobody 
else to go to 
bus service here is not mass transit its eight or nine people 
a day and their faces are familiar to leroy wion the gasstation 
mechanic who doubles as ticketseller and packageloader 
lets see now wion said wiping grease from his hands as he 
listed the regular passengers theres old walt whats his last 
name watkins thats it and several college kids go back and 
forth and the lady who walks down the middle of the road 
that would be margaret wilson 75 whose daily strolls in nylons 
and blazered shorts make her something of a burns institution 
i love to ride the bus she said stopping to talk in the 
middle of broadway ive ridden it for years i dont have any 
other way of getting around 
she takes the bus four times a year to visit her son in emmett 
idaho and twice a year to see her brother in bend i dont know 
why they want to go on strike anyway she said the bus has 
been coming through here for years 
greyhound also carried the commerce of a small western town 
frozen bull semen from the ranches blood from the hospital 
carnations for the florists and carburetors for the autoparts 
store 
graves and her husband brian have kept a few freight customers 
by hauling packages once a week in their own truck to the bus 
terminal in bend but business is way down 
at 36 graves recalls a childhood when six buses arrived daily 
at the fancy bus depot downtown but ridership declined in the 
1960s and two bus runs were eliminated then the depot burned 
down three years ago greyhound bought out pacific trailways and 
halted two of the four remaining runs 
union representatives say they fear the strike will give 
greyhound executives an excuse to accelerate the gradual erosion of 
bus service to burns and other rural points 
until they are in a very good financial operating condition 
again if they ever reach that stage i dont see them going into 
the outoftheway places again said nicholas moore spokesman 
for the portlandbased local 1384 of the striking amalgamated 
transit union it could be months it could be never 
company officials say service will reach 60 percent of 
prestrike levels by easter but concede their focus is on the big 
cities many of the 9000 towns where greyhound provides the only 
intercity transportation are still waiting 
its not our intent to abandon anyone said greyhound 
spokesman george graveley in dallas but he offered no promises 
were not quite ready to commit ourselves to the long term on 
what were going to do 
back at the gas station leroy wion was hoping greyhound would 
make up its mind soon 
greyhound bus depot he said answering the phone no 
maam the strikes still on 
the receiver buzzed with the irate callers reply and wion hung 
up silently he shook his head and told a visitor you dont even 
want to know what she said

polands fast shift to a market economy has 
shocked the 6300 workers and managers of the autosan bus factory 
long wrapped in the warm cocoon of central planning 
with unsold buses gathering dust on the factorys parking lot 
most of the plant is on work holiday and at least several 
hundred people are to be laid off permanently 
it is an example of how for the first time in decades in this 
formerly communist country economic failure packs a painful punch 
to make things harder for sanok a remote community on the edge 
of the carpathian mountains in the southeast corner of poland 
there are already 1500 registered jobseekers and no employers 
large enough to absorb them in housingshort poland relocating is 
seldom an option 
sanok will become a city of the unemployed said metalworker 
stanislaw potoczny ruefully 
people are depressed by the situation really depressed 
said jan solar foreman in charge of the tooling department 
everyone is wondering if i am fired who will employ me 
company director jan wilk looking glum during a recent 
interview complained that he had no time to adjust to the free 
economic system introduced jan 1 by the solidarityled government 
and the tightmoney policies imposed to quench raging inflation 
have dried up demand especially for bigticket items like his 
30000 to 60000 buses 
poland has a market economy but it has no market wilk said 
across poland stateowned enterprises like autosan which 
formerly paid only fleeting attention to the balance sheet 
suddenly face the profitorperish pressure that managers in the 
west have long known 
the government used to be the financier of last resort printing 
money to cover the losses of stateowned enterprises businesses 
were judged by how they fulfilled their plan not by how much money 
they made or whether they produced anything anyone wanted to buy 
but no more 
traditional crutches for east bloc managers easy credit from 
the state government subsidies cheap access to hard currency 
guaranteed customers and lack of competition no longer function 
under the governments farreaching reforms 
having raised prices all they dare and gone through financial 
reserves many companies are now desperately cutting costs to avoid 
bankruptcy that includes labor costs in a country where job 
security was considered a birthright through four decades of 
communism 
the government has budgeted unemployment benefits for 400000 
people this year but does not dispute a world bank projection of up 
to 17 million jobless in a work force of 18 million 
on the autosan plant floor the threat of layoffs has brought 
about a new respect for jobs among employees said foreman solar 
an atmosphere of good work has come back because they are 
afraid of being fired before if i asked people to do something 
they might not do it now everyone does 
it is one of the points of the reform that is positive 
wilk said government policy had mandated that autosan produce 
for the domestic bus market and for the soviet union at prices that 
were not profitable now he is scrambling to find new markets in 
europe and africa and hoping for a western company to subcontract 
work or form a joint venture 
an offer for cooperation was sent out blindly to western 
companies and even to embassies listing assets and a dozen ideas 
that might interest foreign partners ranging from making a 
complete bus to leasing factory space 
the scope of our services can be expanded to customers needs 
and trend of business all your suggestions will be welcomed so 
get your chance the englishlanguage brochure says hopefully 
but wilk has no illusion that a western partner will solve his 
shortterm problem 240 new buses and 1200 trailers parked at his 
factory with no customers in sight hes decided to stop production 
except for special orders 
if production is lower then the number of employees must be 
lower too he said 
he said he did not know how many people would be let go in all 
but criticized as exaggerated a report on the states pap news 
agency that 1500 workers would get their notices for one thing 
autosan cannot afford the legally required severance pay of three 
months salary 
the plant slowdown started in january and february when 
twoweek work furloughs were ordered another began in april 
wilk then started trimming about 400 jobs the first to go at 
the end of april will be 40 soccer players who did no work but 
were financed from the factory payroll 
laid off too were 120 draftage youths who were working at the 
plant in lieu of serving in the military and about 100 workers who 
had committed disciplinary infractions in the past such as theft 
or drinking veteran workers were offered early retirement and the 
plant canteen was axed he said 
the next target may be recently hired employees those without 
families and up to 2500 workers who on the side operate small 
farms wilk said 
if one would expect solidarity union local head henryk kozik to 
be demoralized he quickly sets the record straight 
i am an optimist says the energetic kozik explaining that 
the union has been working with the management to minimize layoffs 
while striving to help the plant develop business he has few 
qualms about the new governments economic policies 
we all have to root out the consequences of the system that we 
had here for 40 years he said the alternative is to fall into 
the abyss

the fact that no one has spent a day in jail 
in the irancontra scandal will work heavily in john poindexters 
favor on sentencing day legal observers say 
im a great believer in the judge taking his cue from the jury 
and in this case the jury brought in the most severe sentence by 
convicting poindexter on all counts said paul rothstein a 
georgetown university law professor 
but the fact that oliver north didnt get any prison time 
militates a little bit against prison time for poindexter said 
rothstein a past chairman of the american bar associations 
criminal procedure committee 
former national security adviser robert mcfarlane and north both 
were placed on two years probation in the affair mcfarlane 
pleaded guilty to four misdemeanors in the scandal and a jury 
convicted north last year of three felonies 
poindexter was convicted saturday of five felonies conspiracy 
two counts of lying to congress and two counts of obstruction in 
connection with the covert sale of arms to iran and the diversion 
of profits to the contra rebels in nicaragua 
its not clear to me that poindexter was any more culpable 
than the other irancontra defendants north and mcfarlane 
said john nields former chief counsel to the house irancontra 
investigating committee 
nields said that assessment of culpability raises questions in 
his mind as to what an appropriate sentence for poindexter ought 
to be 
poindexter could face up to 25 years in prison and 125 million 
in fines he is to be sentenced june 11 by us district judge 
harold greene mcfarlane was fined 20000 north was ordered to 
pay a 150000 fine and serve a period of community service with an 
antidrug organization 
rothstein said poindexter was further up in the hierarchy than 
north and correspondingly more guilty in the irancontra affair 
a former federal prosecutor agreed saying poindexter was at a 
disadvantage compared with north in terms of pointing the finger 
of responsibility at others 
north had the insulation of poindexter to point to while 
poindexter didnt have anyone but president reagan above him said 
the former prosecutor who is now a defense attorney in washington 
and who spoke on condition of anonymity 
a jail sentence could be viewed as a deterrent said a second 
former prosecutor now also a defense attorney in washington 
the issue becomes does harold greene want to sentence john 
poindexter for any of this as a symbol since in all likelihood 
there will be no further prosecution of reagan administration 
higherups said a third former federal prosecutor now practicing 
law in new york he also spoke on condition of anonymity 
rothstein predicted that greene would be sensitive to an 
employee who was put in this bad position by his boss the 
president the judge will sympathize to some extent with 
poindexters predicament he said 
poindexters lawyers portrayed him at his trial as a loyal 
hardworking bureaucrat who tried his best to carry out reagans 
policies a view reflected by conservatives 
it was a shame a patriot like admiral poindexter should have 
to face possible incarceration rep dan burton rind said in 
a statement 
after pleading guilty in the irancontra affair businessmen 
richard secord and albert hakim and fundraisers carl spitz 
channell and richard miller all were placed on two years probation

wants to recreate the ancient forests over 13 million acres of 
northwest indiana 
the tongueincheek plan to establish a new national forest in 
indiana was circulated among lawmakers in response to rep jim 
jontzs call to protect oldgrowth forests in california oregon 
and washington 
this is a novel approach in that it would seek to recreate 
ancient forests of the region which have been decimated by 
industrial agriculture rep don young ralaska said in a 
letter explaining his idea 
today instead of virgin forests and unbroken sod this area 
is heavily industrialized either in manufacturing or agriculture 
if you think the folks in chicago and indianapolis deserve a 
national forest for their recreation please join me in this 
effort he wrote 
last week jontz dind drew criticism from oregon and 
washington lawmakers who said his proposal to set up a new 
preserve of oldgrowth forests in the pacific northwest would cost 
the regions timber industry billions of dollars and thousands of 
jobs 
maybe we should take all the warehouses in muncie ind and 
declare them to be ancient historic treasures said sen slade 
gorton rwash 
jontz indicated monday he would not take youngs proposal 
seriously we all like don hes really a funny guy jontz said 
in a statement 
young was in alaska on monday and could not be reached for 
further comment his aides in washington and anchorage did not 
return telephone messages 
young said in the letter that under hios proposal congress 
would order the us forest service to acquire 13 million acres in 
northwest indiana through purchase or donation he said it would 
reduce ground water pollution caused by runoff from farm chemicals 
while this forest might cost a bit up front the reduced 
need for federal subsidies for agricultural production over the 
long haul would mean savings for the federal government thousands 
of jobs could be created in the tourism industry he said 
jontzs plan backed by four leading environmental groups would 
ban logging and development on millions of acres of public forest 
land 
forest service chief f dale robertson said last week that a 
scientific panels recommendations to save the northern spotted owl 
from extinction would affect 27 million acres and reduce harvests 
by about 25 percent on national forests in the pacific northwest 
jontz said his proposal would affect more land because it is 
involved with protecting the ecosystems of the oldgrowth forests 
not just the spotted owl 
rep bob smith rore said jontz has been insensitive to the 
fate of the northwests economy he said that although youngs 
proposal was made in jest the overall message was serious 
i think it reflects the level of frustration a lot of us in 
the west feel about someone in indiana who obviously feels it is no 
skin off his nose regarding what probably will be the biggest 
economic dislocation the pacific northwest ever will experience 
smith said in a telephone interview 
maybe we should have some pain and suffering developing in 
indiana so they could understand what we are going through maybe 
that would ease the emotional pitch that some people in indiana are 
looking at this with smith said

the bush administration is signaling it 
intends to take a harder line toward el salvadors government and 
the leftist guerrillas who have waged a decadelong civil war 
officials say 
the new policy is coming about through discussions with 
congress where el salvador remains a leading sore point in foreign 
policy 
a first round of contacts came last week between secretary of 
state james a baker iii and congressional leaders of both parties 
baker aides said the visits on capitol hill were intended to 
indicate a willingness to rethink the us policy of undiluted 
support for the salvadoran government 
on one side the issue is being propelled by mounting concern 
among congressional liberals over human rights lapses in the tiny 
central american country and in particular the murders last year 
of six jesuit priests 
from the administrations standpoint a bipartisan agreement on 
us policy would blunt a thorny domestic political issue and 
enhance chances for success at united nationssponsored talks in 
geneva between the salvadoran government and the leftist rebels 
the civil war has cost an estimated 70000 lives 
success in those talks is particularly important to bernard 
aronson assistant secretary of state for interamerican affairs 
aides said he has a deep personal desire to promote peace in what 
remains the most serious trouble spot in the hemisphere 
my sense is there will be some restriction on aid to the 
government of el salvador conditioned on an effective 
investigation and prosecution of the jesuit murders said a 
senior congressional republican speaking on condition of anonymity 
at least two serious complications threaten the discussions 
congressional sources said shipments of weapons to the fmln 
rebels from nicaragua have tripled in the past month since the 
leftist sandinista government in managua lost in national 
elections the steppedup shipments apparently are an effort to 
build stockpiles before a new government takes over and the weapons 
pipeline is shut down the sources said 
and there are indications that the salvadoran government may be 
unable to successfully prosecute col guillermo alfredo benavides 
the highestranking officer indicted in the jesuit slayings 
because of insufficient evidence and a weak judicial system 
meetings between baker and members of congress reminiscent of 
the process the secretary followed last year to forge a bipartisan 
policy on nicaragua will resume after lawmakers return from their 
easter recess on april 18 
this break allows time for the talks in geneva to proceed 
said sen richard lugar rind a senior member of the senate 
foreign relations committee if they make headway it will be a 
lot easier for us to get a bipartisan accord 
lugar said that conversely agreement among us politicians 
could enhance chances for negotiating success between the two 
warring sides in el salvador 
our statements and motions and debates here have a 
disproportionate influence on the salvadorans he said often the 
leftist fmln rebels and the government find it easier to sit back 
and hope for their partisans in congress to win policy battles than 
to negotiate themselves lugar added 
while the talks in washington are at an early stage 
participants on both sides said they seem headed toward adoption of 
a new set of conditions on us aid to the salvadoran government 
the conditions could include progress toward creating an effective 
legal system and weeding out suspected human rights abusers from 
the military 
the primary vehicle for discussion has been a proposal by sen 
christopher dodd dconn to withhold half of the countrys 
anticipated 90 million in military aid in fiscal 1991 and use the 
escrowed funds as leverage to keep the two sides negotiating and on 
good behavior 
under dodds proposal if the rebels were to mount a military 
offensive or walk away from the bargaining table the military aid 
to the government would be restored if the government were to seek 
military advantage or quit the talks aid would be cut even more 
deeply 
one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said baker might ultimately be willing to accept some such 
conditions on a small portion of next years military aid money 
less than the 50 percent dodd proposed but enough to send a signal 
that the united states is newly serious about peace and human 
rights 
meanwhile monday the administration said it will spend 36 
million in already appropriated funds to help the peace process in 
nicaragua as a stopgap measure because congress went on an easter 
recess without acting on a central america aid package 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the money will be 
used to help the usbacked contra rebels disband and resettle 
the administrations 870 million aid package included about 30 
million for that purpose 
we are quite concerned about this fitzwater said we 
wanted to foster demobilization and repatriation of the contras 
as expeditiously as possible

high priestess of three covens of metropolitan washington dc 
witches who worship an ancient goddess of fertility 
shes also a shaman a sort of traveling chaplain who visits 
divorcees drug addicts cancer patients and other witches who need

suffering 
she takes along a canvas gym bag stuffed with the tools for a 
portable altar a goddess image chalices incense candles 
broom handcarved wand and a beribboned sword her badge of 
witching authority 
the broom incidentally is not for riding the skies under a 
full moon the bride and groom jump over it for good luck at 
witches weddings or handfastings following centuriesold 
tradition ms st john uses her broom to make sure the altars 
magic circle is swept clean of evil thoughts 
im everything the pastor in your local church would be she 
says i marry em and i bury em i specialize in healing the 
heart i let the doctors work with potions and i work with the 
soul 
her followers gather regularly around a coffee table altar in 
ms st johns townhouse in this washington suburb for an evening 
of meditation worship and study of the wiccan religion a 
natureloving pagan faith with roots in ancient western europe 
her branch of the wiccan tradition celebrates the feminine 
virtues of lifegiving nurturing and respect for the environment

most witches have stayed in the broom closet fearful of job 
losses evictions social ostracism and the vengeful wrath of 
fundamentalist preachers if theyre found out 
ms st john decided to go public when she became outraged over 
accusations that witches practice devil worship and black magic or 
that they boil babies to obtain the fat for making altar candles

you make it happen in your mind and it happens she said

prosecutors may call oliver north and john 
poindexter before a federal grand jury to answer questions about 
the irancontra scandal according to sources who have watched the 
investigation closely 
that would give irancontra prosecutors their first opportunity 
to conduct a wideranging iterrogation of north outside the 
constraints imposed by a courtroom trial setting 
poindexter is a candidate for a grand jury appearance following 
his sentencing june 11 on his convictions for conspiracy 
obstruction and lying to congress say the sources speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
grand jury appearances by north and poindexter probably would 
constitute the final phase of the irancontra criminal 
investigation the sources said a poindexter appearance could 
include questions about former president reagans role in the 
affair 
norths and poindexters testimony which could be compelled 
under a grant of immunity from prosecution probably would not 
produce additional indictments the sources said 
but it could fill in missing information about the affair and 
help prosecutors compile a final report on the scandal 
that is the consensus drawn from a series of interviews with 
sources in and out of government who have watched the irancontra 
investigation closely over the past three years all the comments 
were made on condition of anonymity and the irancontra 
prosecutors office declined to comment on the matter 
poindexter like north gave immunized testimony to congress in 
1987 poindexter testified that he didnt inform president reagan 
about the diversion of iran arms sale proceeds to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
but poindexter didnt testify at his own trial and a grand jury 
appearance would be irancontra prosecutors first opportunity to 
question him 
poindexters conspiracy conviction on saturday was the first 
courtroom confirmation that poindexter north the late cia 
director william j casey national security adviser robert 
mcfarlane and others worked illegally together 
the conspirators goals the investigators have said were to 
conceal from congress evidence of the diversion of iran arms sale 
money to the contras the us role in a hawk missile shipment to 
iran and norths military support for the nicaraguan rebels during 
a time when direct or indirect us aid was banned 
irancontra prosecutor dan webb said saturday he was just a 
little disappointed he didnt get to crossexamine poindexter 
webb said he considered poindexters vulnerable points to 
include the former national security advisers destruction of a 
nov 21 1986 document signed by reagan that approved the hawk 
missile shipment to iran 
webb said he also wanted to question poindexter about why he 
congratulated oliver north after he found out north lied to 
congress said the prosecutor 
north denied to the house intelligence committee that he was 
giving military advice to the contras poindexter subsequently sent 
north a message saying well done 
if north is called before a grand jury his personal notes 
scribbled in spiralbound notebooks would provide the grist for a 
lengthy list of questions from prosecutors his copious notes 
pertain to daily conversations on the iran and contra initiatives 
portions of the notebooks were available to congressional 
investigators after north attorney brendan sullivan supplied them 
to congress north was forced to turn over all of the notebooks to 
prosecutors a year ago when he testified at his own trial 
norths notebooks for 1984 through 1986 contain thousands of 
pages of daily jottings listing who he talked to when and the 
outline of the discussions parts of them were released publicly by 
congress but most of them were not 
irancontra prosecutors are likely to be interested in norths 
contact with donald gregg of thenvice president bushs office 
meetings with the state departments elliott abrams and the 
cias alan fiers 
gregg now the us ambassador to south korea has said he did 
not know of norths involvement with the contra resupply operation 
until aug 8 1986 gregg then bushs national security affairs 
adviser said he didnt tell the vice president of norths role 
until december 1986 
abrams fiers and north met frequently during a congressional 
ban on military aid to the contras which required the cia to 
withdraw from its role of supplying the rebel force

edward gierek who was toppled as polands 
communist leader in 1980 after solidaritys birth has broken a 
10year silence on state television to push a book on his decade of 
rule 
gierek 77 told viewers on sunday that his silence had not 
been my fault and thanked people whom he did not name for helping 
to publish the aborted decade the book due out this month is 
based on interviews of gierek by journalist janusz rolicki 
giereks trademark crewcut has grayed and he spoke standing in 
his oneminute remarks wearing a blue sweater and glasses 
gierek came to power as head of polands communist party in 
1970 succeeding wladyslaw gomulka who was forced out after 
security forces fired on workers in the baltic ports of gdansk and 
gdynia killing scores 
a onetime coal miner in france and belgium gierek boosted 
polands international reputation while improving poles standard 
of living by borrowing heavily from abroad 
but that borrowing led to a multibilliondollar foreign debt and 
then solidarity the east blocs first independent labor 
federation was born in a workers revolt 
giereks former party comrades blamed him for the workers 
grievances and the foreign debt and he was forced to retire to his 
home city of katowice where he has led a reclusive existence 
over the years gierek routinely refused requests for interviews 
now the union he agreed to legalize in 1980 has created the 
east blocs first noncommunist government and the party he once 
led has officially been dissolved 
of his upcoming book gierek said i leave the judgment of the 
contents to the readers they will judge those years the 70s 
in the best most just way

open pits of oily waste dotting the arid 
landscape of west texas new mexico and oklahoma are instant 
deathtraps for hundreds of thousands of migratory birds each year 
say federal officials who are cracking down on the pit owners 
once their wings touch that oil they crash once they 
land theyre done they start preening their feathers and that oil 
gets into their digestive system its really a pathetic death 
said tom smylie assistant regional director of the us fish and 
wildlife services southwest region 
robert lee a special agent with the wildlife service in 
lubbock texas said half a million protected nongame birds are 
killed in the pits every year in texas oklahoma and new mexico 
along with another 100000 waterfowl 
thats twice the number of birds estimated killed by the exxon 
valdez oil spill and thats annually lee said 
lee and smylie complained that state regulators in texas and 
oklahoma have failed to vigorously pursue the problem new mexico 
requires screens on open pits and smylie said 90 percent of the 
states 5649 known pits have been covered 
the fish and wildlife service after investigating the problem 
in late 1988 gave oil and gas companies and other industries that 
use the pits a oneyear grace period to cover them or clean them up 
since oct 3 1989 operators of pits have been subject to 
criminal fines under the migratory bird treaty act which makes it 
illegal at any time by any means or in any manner to kill 
any migratory birds 
in the first case since then union pacific railroad of houston 
pleaded guilty before a us magistrate in lubbock to killing 46 
migratory birds in a waste treatment pond in big spring 
the company is to pay a 5000 criminal penalty and 139350 in 
civil restitution to the texas parks and wildlife department for 
the lost birds it also must cover the pond with a screen mesh to 
prevent further wildlife deaths the wildlife service said 
us attorney marvin collins of the northern district of texas 
said he wanted the case to serve as a warning to those in the oil 
industry who have neglected to clean up their oil pits if they 
have oil pits that are killing migratory birds this office will 
actively pursue their prosecution 
lee said he is working on additional cases against 29 companies 
with pits or tanks in his region of west texas 
lee said he believes there are thousands of pits and tanks 
covered with an oily film in his region of texas alone and i 
have reason to believe there are at least as many pits per area of 
oil production in other parts of texas 
most of the pits im dealing with contain at least a skim of 
oil some are full of oil some of them are legal and permitted by 
the state of texas many of them are in violation of state law 
lee said 
lee called the illegal pits a deathtrap for birds and other 
wildlife including porcupines opossums whitetailed deer 
coyotes rabbits and reptiles 
but texas railroad commission spokesman brian schaible said the 
state already prohibits the storage of oil in such pits 
we have rules in place that make storing of oil in those pits 
illegal schaible said friday it seems kind of 
counterproductive to have a rule that you have to have a net over 
this pit that has illegal oil in it the bottom line is that weve 
got the rules were enforcing the rules 
schaible said testimony from the oil industry in texas is that 
they dont have problems with birds

gov gaston caperton whose 23year 
marriage ended in a messy divorce last fall has gone public with 
his new relationship with a symphony conductor his former wife 
meanwhile is running for state treasurer 
former beauty queen dee caperton says she can work cooperatively 
with the governor and she dismisses speculation she may run 
against him in 1992 with millions of dollars received in their 
divorce settlement 
she faces two other democrats in a primary may 8 
as treasurer ms caperton and the governor would have to work 
closely on several boards including one that oversees most state 
finances 
their relationship clearly is strained however caperton has 
abruptly left political events when his exwife arrives 
caperton 50 recently made public his relationship with rachael 
worby 40 conductor of the wheeling symphony orchestra and also 
recently divorced 
rather than having people constantly speculating we tried to 
be as upfront as possible gubernatorial spokesman gc morse 
said it was done for an interested public not a public 
interest 
but as capertons old and new female companions hold the 
publics eye the governors popularity has plummeted to the lowest 
level since his landslide election in 1988 
only 14 percent of state residents said he was doing a good or 
excellent job during west virginias first statewide teachers 
strike last month according to a statewide poll taken for several 
news organizations 
caperton a political newcomer who built up his familys small 
insurance company defeated arch moore on a pledge of integrity and 
a break with the politics of the past 
it was his former wife a tall blonde runnerup in the 1964 
miss america pageant who blazed the familys political trail by 
winning a house of delegates seat in 1986 she gave up her seat in 
1988 to help her husband run for governor 
but five months after his january 1989 inaugural address 
caperton acknowledged his wife had moved out of the governors 
mansion and they would divorce 
ms caperton 47 sued for divorce in county court in july she 
then went to federal court in august charging the governor and an 
associate defrauded her of 12 million from sale of stock in the 
family business 
they were divorced oct 24 as the federal suit was settled 
privately for 11 million according to many local media reports 
that neither side would confirm ms caperton said her husband was 
worth 30 million 
in an interview ms caperton said the effects of the divorce 
have been a wash 
for the person it disturbs there is another person affected 
positively by it she said 
she also denied speculation in west virginia media and the 
washington post that she is interested in the governorship 
no no i intend to run for treasurer again in 1992 she 
said 
the governor who declined to be interviewed has said he has 
not tried to scuttle his exwifes candidacy 
for her part ms caperton has shown no animosity toward the new 
first couple 
i have met rachael and she is a very accomplished person 
ms caperton said and i wish her well 
worby who studied musicology at brandeis university became the 
wheeling symphonys conductor in 1986 and is credited with 
dramatically increasing the symphonys ticket sales and budget she 
also serves as music director of carnegie hall young peoples 
concert 
morse said worby is not a political person and the tough world 
of politics is unknown to her 
what upsets caperton is any potential toll on her morse 
said i think its hard for him as much as he cares for her 
and i think he does he didnt want attention spilling over and 
hurting her

members of a house committee hope to get 
permission this week to inspect cam ranh bay a usbuilt 
military base in vietnam that a congressman says could one day 
end up back in american hands 
the armed services committee delegation wants to visit the base 
as part of a 10day trip to vietnam guam singapore and indonesia 
that is scheduled to end on april 17 the missions purpose is to 
explore alternatives to united states military bases in the 
philippines and examine us security responsibilities in the 
region 
the soviet union moved into cam ranh bay after the vietnam war 
but pentagon officials said in january that the soviets had 
withdrawn some fighter planes and bombers visiting the base would 
require both soviet and vietnamese cooperation 
vietnamese officials surprised several american lawmakers 
recently by suggesting privately that the united states might be 
allowed to return to the base if relations between the countries 
continue to warm rep tom ridge rpa said in an interview last 
week 
the lease on the six us military installations in the 
philippines expires in 1991 and american officials are 
anticipating difficult negotiations for continued base rights there 
the possibility of the soviets completing their withdrawal at 
cam ranh bay and the americans returning was raised in february at 
a forum in bali indonesia sponsored by the henry r luce 
foundation ridge said he said he attended the forum along with 
several other congressmen and a group of topranking vietnamese 
government officials 
that possibility was discussed and under the right set of 
circumstances i think the vietnamese would welcome it said 
ridge who is the only member of congress to have seen vietnam war 
combat as an enlisted man 
one of the ranking vietnamese officials said i can see the 
day when american ships are docked in cam ranh bay ridge said 
adding that the official later specified that he meant warships 
we said do you mean just for refueling and they said no 
for repairs ridge said 
ridge said conditions of the forum prevented him from 
identifying the vietnamese official 
ridge said an american takeover at cam ranh bay would be a 
natural outgrowth of normalized relations with vietnam and that it 
would make sense because we built it 
rep chester atkins dmass who also attended the meeting 
said returning to cam ranh bay would require some major changes 
in the relationship between the united states and vietnam 
but atkins who declined to discuss specifics of the meeting 
also said i think the vietnamese are desperate their economy is 
in a state of continued deterioration i think theyre willing to 
look at or think about anything that doesnt endanger their 
national security that would allow them to rejoin the economic 
community and modernize 
seven congressmen hope to visit cam ranh bay in the next week to 
determine the extent of the soviet reductions there said 
delegation leader rep pat schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the 
house armed services subcommittee that oversees military bases 
such a visit will require both vietnamese and soviet approval 
so i dont know if well get there or not schroeder said 
friday the subcommittee said it could not release a timetable for 
such a visit because of security considerations the trip ends in 
hawaii on april 17 
schroeder emphasized that the purpose of the trip was 
informational 
we in the us congress cannot negotiate with either the 
soviets or the vietnamese on cam ranh bay but it is a very 
important facility and it is in a country that appears to be in a 
positive transition more towards our side schroeder said 
regardless of what happens with cam ranh bay she said she 
wanted to uncover base alternatives because some in the 
philippines are demanding that we pay 2 billion a year in rent 
to keep us installations there 
the united states and vietnam have no diplomatic or trade 
relations the state department says it will consider relations 
only after verification of vietnamese troop withdrawals from 
cambodia and after a process of internationally supervised 
elections in cambodia is established 
the state department has no received no offer from the 
vietnamese about cam ranh bay according to a department official 
who spoke last week on condition of anonymity 
in 1988 the soviets offered to abandon cam ranh bay if the 
united states did the same with its philippines bases the us 
rejected the offer saying it needed the pacific bases to support 
its worldwide operations

backing for the b2 stealth bomber is 
virtually invisible these days 
congressional opponents of the radarevading aircraft are 
turning up the volume in their rhetorical offensive part of a 
struggle over a white housefavored weapon that in a sense sums up 
this years battle over military spending 
what we ought to do is have the guts now to say enough is 
enough and stop at the 15 that are in production sen patrick 
leahy dvt told a capitol hill news conference last week 
on thursday two republicans on the senate armed services 
committee a panel that last year largely supported president 
bushs defense blueprint chastised him for reacting too slowly to 
changes in eastern europe and worked their opposition to the b2 
into the argument 
sens william cohen of maine and john mccain of arizona called 
for a reduction in the air forces plan to buy 132 of the planes 
cohen said he favors canceling the plane altogether while mccain 
indicated he could go either way on canceling the plane 
one day earlier a bipartisan group of senators urged 
cancellation as they released a congressional study concluding that 
slowing it down would raise the cost of a single plane from about 
530 million to more than 1 billion 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee and a b2 proponent summed up the handwriting on the 
wall 
any time you have a weapons system start showing up on 
saturday night live and in the cartoons you know its got 
trouble nunn said the b2 is in that category 
in the house rep jim slattery dkan said legislation that 
would stop procurement of the b2 bomber after the 15 currently in 
production has 195 backers among the 434 members 
acknowledging the growing opposition air force secretary donald 
rice said earlier this week that the service is reviewing possible 
alternatives to buying all 132 planes now sought 
nunn whose decisions on defense issues largely determine which 
way the senate goes made it clear to the air force and the planes 
manufacturer northrop corp that the numbers on the b2 have to 
change 
i think the cost of the b2 has to be brought down either 
through the per unit cost coming down which is the best way or 
through lowering the number of units he said 
in this years debate between congress and the bush 
administration over defense spending little has been said on the 
issues that captured the spotlight in past years 
landbased nuclear missiles have received some mention base 
closings disappeared after the initial cries of partisan politics 
the strategic defense initiative hasnt been discussed since bushs 
trips earlier this year to test sites in california 
rather the debate has centered on the b2 bomber and several 
simple questions 
does the nation need a penetrating bomber to attack mobile 
targets in the soviet union when the warsaw pact has collapsed as a 
military alliance and the kremlin is faced with economic woes and 
ethnic unrest 
as the federal deficit increases can the country afford the 
most expensive aircraft in history when some suggest b1 bombers 
and b52s equipped with cruise missiles will suffice until 2030 
will the government spend nearly 10 billion on a single program 
in the mid1990s 
faced with the public calls for cuts in defense the parochial 
military demands in an election year and the changing strategy 
many lawmakers find killing the b2 an easy answer 
the decision wont be made for several months but for now the 
issue provides an opportunity for opponents to provide the rhetoric 
the stealth is a budgetary black hole it attracts and 
devours public funds like a condensed star attracts and devours 
light said sen joseph lieberman dconn

undaunted by drug and perjury charges mayor 
marion barry is trying to shed his night owl image and present 
himself as a changed man in preparation for what aides say will be 
a reelection bid 
three weeks after returning to washington fresh from nearly two 
months of substance abuse treatment barry is making community 
appearances and talking up issues such as drugs crime and schools 
that play well with voters 
in speeches to key constituent blocs the elderly lowincome 
residents and communitybased church groups barry has been 
portraying himself as a new man a person who is fighting 
alcoholism but thinking more clearly than ever before 
i feel a little bit like a prodigal son who got lost for a bit 
and then got back home barry told one group of supporters 
let me tell you im glad to be back home 
barry put his reelection plans on hold in the days follhas made no 
public announcement about his 
plans but key advisers speaking on condition of anonymity say 
the mayor intends to run again 
one of barrys closest political advisers said the mayors 
campaign staff has started planning campaign events 
he will run the adviser said his thinking is he still 
has the support of many members of the community and he can beat 
these charges so why not run 
barry who was arrested at a downtown hotel after allegedly 
being videotaped using cocaine is scheduled for trial june 4 on 
five misdemeanor counts of cocaine possession and three felony 
perjury charges related to his testimony before a grand jury about 
drug use 
if convicted of a felony barry would be barred from holding 
office or running for reelection conviction of a misdemeanor 
would not bar him from office 
even if he is convicted of a misdemeanor he thinks he can run 
and win said one aide i dont think you will see anything 
until after the trial 
the washington post quoted sources this weekend as saying that 
barry rejected a suggestion from his attorney r kenneth mundy 
that he plead guilty to a misdemeanor account of cocaine possession 
to strengthen his chances of acquittal on more serious charges the 
paper said barry refused to comment on his legal case 
in an interview last week with the associated press barry 
refused to reveal his political plans but he would not rule out a 
run for a fourth fouryear term 
ill make that decision at the right time barry said i 
still have the personal and political support of a lot of people 
and that gratifies me 
public opinion polls taken after barrys arrest found that the 
mayor still had the support of between 20 percent and 25 percent of 
the community barry strategists believe that if all five 
candidates currently in the democratic mayoral race are on the 
ballot the mayor could win 
candidates must file by july 5 to qualify for the sept 11 
democratic primary which is tantamount to election in the 
district the deadline for filing as an independent candidate is 
aug 13 
barry who in 1988 proudly described himself as a night owl 
now tries to project a public image of humility and commitment to 
his family 
at many public events barry concedes that he suffers from 
alcoholism but also insists that he is beating the problem and can 
govern effectively 
barry has been claiming a new understanding of the ravages of 
substance abuse and has pledged to improve drug treatment programs 
for the citys growing number of addicts 
the mayor also is taking advantage of his incumbency to remain 
in the public eye last tuesday while the declared mayoral 
candidates appeared at an issues forum barry was at a nearby 
hospital praising an antidrug program he had started there last 
year 
he can certainly make a case that that problem is something in 
his past that drugs are something he has put behind him a third 
adviser said

perhaps even now pregnant wasps are waking 
from their winter slumber at kennedy space center to build paper 
nests and lay eggs in the warm florida sun 
by september the eager young hatchlings will be swarming to look 
for mates the tops of 300foot launch towers built by humans for 
trips to the stars are favorite places for wasp courtship and 
frenzied lovemaking 
the swarming goes on until middecember weeks when workers at 
the center are pestered and threatened by the wasps says an 
agriculture department report scientists are trying to rig 
effective traps but admit those may take a few more years of 
research 
entomologist peter j landolt of the departments agricultural 
research service suspects the wasps mistake the tall launch towers 
for their usual mating sites trees and hilltops 
thus when the mating swarms leave nests built in bushes or on 
houses the launch towers and other manmade structures at the 
center are the tallest things around 
landolt who works for the agencys research laboratory in 
gainesville fla said thousands of male wasps lead off the mating 
ritual by swarming to kennedy facilities favored gathering places 
are around a launch pads crane and near the crane motors housing 
room 
the males search for anything that protrudes to sit on a bolt 
for example then they rub their heads and tails on the perch to 
release sex attractants or pheromones into the air to attract 
females 
they bite and wrestle trying to knock each other off the 
perches its a very competitive time and there is a prize 
we believe each male wants an ideal spot to sit and wait for 
virgin females to arrive so he can mate landolt said every 
male wants his pheromone odor to be strongest so that females will 
be attracted to him 
hundreds of female wasps lured by the scents of sexhungry 
males and the tall towers swarm to greet the thousands of suitors 
selecting the ones they desire the couples mate in midair 
requiring about a minute 
once inseminated the females fly into the crane housing room 
where they cluster together on walls to keep warm and protect 
themselves from predators or they squeeze into cracks and crevices 
the females remain there all winter living off stored body fat 
util spring when they return to the ground to build nests of paper 
they make by chewing bark from trees then they lay their eggs use 
themselves up protecting the brood and die in the fall 
meanwhile the male wasps that were successful suitors during 
the previous swarm season eventually die also having dutifully 
served their sole purpose in life the report said the 
unsuccessful males also die of course 
the space center wasp project was reported by jessica morrison 
silva of the usda agencys beltsville md staff in the current 
issue of agricultural research magazine 
officials of the national aeronautics and space administration 
asked usda two years ago for help to control the wasps so far 
landolt and colleague hal c reed have worked out what they think 
is the wasps annual mating ritual but they arent completely sure 
for one thing they have to be certain the wasps are mistaking 
launch towers for tall trees so landolt and reed plan to go into 
the everglades in search of nesting wasps in tall trees to 
corroborate the theory 
eventually they hope to isolate and reproduce the pheromones 
used by the wasps in their sex rituals with the synthetic sex 
attractants traps can be built to control the pests 
since the problem began five years ago only one nasa employee 
has been stung at the center despite the large numbers of wasps 
but just seeing a thousand or more wasps buzzing around at 300 feet 
can be hazardous by itself landolt said 
aside from the employee hazard nasa wants to ensure that the 
wasps dont enter a space shuttles electronic and mechanical 
equipment 
obviously a shuttle liftoff is an effective and quick means 
of controlling the wasp problem reed said 
but nasa wants a less drastic way of curbing the wasps between 
liftoffs

political dialogue with lithuania but a lithuanian calls that 
claim a lie

soviet president mikhail gorbachevs government wants to resolve 
the lithuanian situation through political dialogue and 
obviously this is what is going on now churkin said we are 
thinking about it in those terms 
but algimantis cekuolis a lithuanian official called that 
statement a lie 
both men appeared on abctvs this week with david brinkley 
they would be very happy to do anything to overthrow that 
lithuanian government like using a military force from inside 
and economical blockade from outside cekuolis said 
that lie number three that was told that political dialogue 
going on there is no political dialogue if you dont mean this 
kalashnikov gun he said 
lithuanians have tried to talk with the soviets but have only 
managed to get three hours of time from one of gorbachevs 
deputies he said 
churkin said the lithuanians who have demanded independence 
from moscow acted precipitously in trying to secede before working 
out details of their future relationship with the soviet union on

theyre hip theyre green cowabunga 
a quartet of pizzachomping turtles has taken hollywood by storm 
whats next for the teenage mutant ninja turtles they have 
their own comic book a cartoon series toys and now their own 
movie that made 254 million at the box office in the biggest 
spring opening in hollywood history 
maybe an amusement park cocreator peter laird said its 
something thats crossed our minds a couple of times 
the movie teenage mutant ninja turtles fell behind only 
batman and ghostbuster ii for the biggest box office take 
in a films first three days exhibitor relations co said last 
week 
we had a good feeling about the movie laird said from 
the beginning we thought it could do well but not this well 
its a long way from a winters night seven years ago when laird 
and fellow starving artist kevin eastman dreamed up four 
irreverent adolescent creatures skilled in the martial arts and 
named for renaissance artists leonardo michelangelo raphael and 
donatello 
eastman and laird are agog over the mutants success 
its exciting its scary its tense its pinch yourself 
once a day eastman said 
its been an exciting experience and exhilarating and so 
forth laird said its also been a sobering and humbling 
experience we now know that people who get famous for what they do 
are just ordinary people because thats what we are 
the amphibian brothers intended as parodies of the bigmuscled 
heros of conventional comics started as aquarium pets and mutated 
after falling into a pool of radioactive goo in a new york sewer 
they were raised by splinter the mutant pet rat of a ninja master 
and became radical crime fighters fond of the surfer cry 
cowabunga 
eastman was a sandwich maker and laird eked out a living drawing 
illustrations for local newspapers when they met in 1982 
the mutant turtles gurgled from their heads onto paper about a 
year later after a latenight sketching duel that eastman said was 
fueled by an evening of watching bad television 
from there the green heroes in a half shell never looked 
back 
laird and eastman issued their first ninja turtle comic book in 
1984 printed on 1200 they scraped up between them a smash tv 
cartoon series and some serious marketing followed 
there are about 100 licensed ninja turtle products including 
candy cookies a board game a video game and 4inchtall action 
figures that have been bestselling toys last two years 
the creators who live in northampton are often asked to 
explain how four super turtles captured such a huge audience 
i think theyre appealing for a number of reasons laird 
said the turtles live their lives with the philosophy that they 
dont want to hassle anybody and they dont want to be hassled 
themselves but when trouble comes theyre able to handle it 
eastman said fan letters range from crayoned missives to 
correspondence from doctors and lawyers 
i think the kids in some respects like beside the silliness 
and the characters the family attitude with the four brothers and 
splinter playing the father figure and the teacher he said 
keeping control over the myriad turtle products is becoming more 
difficult but laird and eastman said theyve been careful to 
monitor the marketing 
we do still maintain the approval process because they are our 
babies laird said

nick faldo became only the second man to win 
the storied masters golf tournament two years in a row snaring the 
title from raymond floyd who blew a fourshot lead on the final six 
holes 
the englishman did it in similar fashion to last years victory 
winning on the second hole of a suddendeath playoff when floyds 
approach found the pond 
its the most devastating thing thats happened to me in my 
career the distraught floyd said 
when you have a guy that you know is a great frontrunner it 
sets your course said faldo who won on the second hole of a 
playoff with scott hoch last year 
the two finished regulation with 10underpar 278 totals both 
had pars on the first extra hole 
floyd may have cost himself a second masters title by playing 
safe hoping to par in for the victory that would make him at 47 
the oldest masters winner in history 
jack nicklaus won this title for the sixth time in 1986 when he 
was 46 nicklaus also was the only backtoback winner in 1965 and 
66 
it would have made floyd the first player with a major 
championship in four decades he won pga crowns in 1969 and 1982 
the masters in 1976 and the us open in 1986

in its fourthlargest singleday surge the key 
index on the tokyo stock exchange closed above the 30000point 
level monday while the dollar fell sharply against the japanese 
yen 
the 225share nikkei stock average rose 111915 points or 382 
percent ending the day at 3039793 on friday the index rose 
102972 points in its fifthlargest singleday advance the nikkei 
last closed higher than 30000 points on march 29 when it ended 
the day at 3102616 
the dollar closed at 15645 yen monday down 102 yen from 
fridays close of 15747 yen it opened lower at 15580 yen and 
then began to rise ranging between 15560 yen and 15690 yen 
during the day 
in bond dealings the price of benchmark no 119 japanese 
government bonds was 8681 at 3 pm up from fridays close of 
8638 their yield fell to 7185 percent from 7275 percent on 
friday 
the dollar rose quickly as market players with short or 
oversold positions started buying the us currency in the absence 
of coordinated intervention by the central banks of the group of 
seven g7 nations said minori takeuchi a dealer with chemical 
bank in tokyo 
investors had expected that the dollar would be pushed down 
further by coordinated dollarselling intervention since that did 
not materialize today no matter how long they waited market 
players finally started buying dollars again she said 
monetary authorities from the g7 britain canada france 
west germany italy japan and the united states agreed in their 
meeting in paris saturday that the yens recent downswing could 
have undesirable consequences 
they also promised to keep the exchange markets under review 
and renewed their commitment to coordinate economic policies 
including cooperation on exchange markets 
but analysts believe that many countries are reluctant to help 
japan stem the fall in the yen because they see the yens weakness 
as japans internal problem japans central bank also insists that 
it will not raise its official discount rate 
japans finance minister ryotaro hashimoto who returned from 
the g7 meeting sunday told an upper house budget committee 
session monday morning that participants in the g7 meeting shared 
concern over higher interest rates 
ms takeuchi said the yen might rise a certain extent but only 
temporarily she said that will not change the dollars uptrend 
because there is no other means beside market intervention to 
revive the yen 
akihiko kagawa a dealer with the bank of tokyo said many 
currency players believed that the g7 countries had committed 
themselves firmly to preventing a further slide in the yen 
he said the market was testing how closely the g7 countries 
would cooperate in joint market intervention 
on the stock market nomura securities analyst hisato haganuma 
attributed the indexs large gains to rises in the dollar and bond 
prices 
market players bought a broad range of issues including 
electric issues he said 
but haganuma said the surges monday and friday may not lead to 
further rises in stock prices currently market players are 
short of stocks to sell because few investors were buying issues 
when the index was falling last week particularly since the index 
fell from the 32000point mark he said 
after a round of buying the indexs uptrend will slow and hit a 
plateau he said 
toshiyuki nushiguchi an analyst with daiwa securities co said 
the stock market responded favorably to last weeks japanus 
structural trade talks as well as to the g7 meeting 
he said speculation on interest ratesensitive issues had 
disappeared after the g7 meeting some market participants had 
feared that participating countries might raise their interest 
rates to stem inflation 
higher interest rates tend to support a countrys currency but 
discourage stock investment

a sellout crowd of about 45000 people at the hoosier dome heard 
more than 60 musicians including elton john bonnie raitt 
jackson browne and the band crosby stills and nash perform in 
the saturday night show 
it would be nice if there wasnt a need for farm aid it would 
be nice if our governments policies reflected a concern for 
families and for farming theres all kinds of things in this world 
that would be nice we have to fight to make this government 
responsive to our needs browne said 
donations for the fourth farm aid concert were still being 
tallied sunday and final figures were not scheduled to be released 
until today said farm aid spokeswoman linda lewi as of late 
saturday 13 million had been raised she said 
the concert came two weeks before the nation observes the 20th 
anniversary of earth day and willie nelson and other farm aid 
leaders took the opportunity to announce the forging of a coalition 
with farmers environmentalists and consumers to work toward less 
use of pesticides and other chemicals in food production and more 
support for organic farming 
postcards were distributed to concertgoers calling on congress 
to pass a 1990 farm bill that will help family farmers use fewer 
chemicals and practice environmentally safe farming methods and to 
provide a pricing structure that covers the cost of food production

indicated in an interview that federal farm policy has sacrificed 
the welfare of the independent farmer to promote corporate 
agriculture concerns

that we admire right and i think that we havent felt the 
backlash of the last eight years yet i think the 90s will reflect 
that said mellencamp

celebrated novelist mario vargas llosa won the 
most votes in perus presidential elections but a politically 
independent agronomist who surged from behind has forced a runoff 
unofficial returns showed today 
this fragile democracy is wracked by economic crisis and the 
10yearold insurgency by the maoistinspired shining path which 
staged attacks during sundays voting and in preceding weeks in an 
effort to thwart the election 
soldiers armed with automatic weapons protected polling 
stations several of which were attacked sunday by guerrillas 
hurling sticks of dynamite police reported no injuries in those 
attacks and millions of voters turned out to vote for a president 
and new congress 
unofficial returns early today showed vargas llosa a 
54yearold advocate of free market reforms and economic shock 
therapy leading with 339 percent of the vote far short of the 
50 percent required to avoid a runoff 
alberto fujimori the 51yearold son of japanese immigrants 
garnered 29 percent pushing aside the candidate of the centerleft 
governing party luis alva castro who a few weeks ago held a solid 
second in the polls 
fujimori a former university rector has in his shoestring 
campaign stressed honor technology and work qualities many 
associate with his japanese ancestry but he never provided a 
detailed plan of government 
he is one of about 100000 people of japanese descent in the 
country and many voters said they thought he could attract 
substantial japanese investment to this country where 70 percent of 
people are underemployed or unemployed 
independent pollsters gave fujimori a betterthaneven chance of 
defeating vargas llosa in the second round of voting expected in 
late may or early june the new president will be inaugurated on 
july 28 
the unofficial results showed alva castro to have won 164 
percent of the vote six other presidential candidates split the 
remaining vote 
official results were expected to take up to 20 days as many 
polling stations were in remote villages voting is mandatory for 
those 18 and older 
guerrillas staged attacks throughout the country on sunday but 
most of the countrys 98 million registered voters appeared to 
ignore rebel threats for death for those casting ballots 
in recent weeks the guerrillas have assassinated six 
congressional candidates and killed or wounded dozens of people in 
recent weeks aiming to disrupt the election 
at least 28 people were killed and 44 wounded in weekend 
attacks including 17 peasants massacred by rebels in santo tomas 
de pata a village near ayacucho also two rebels died when a 
dynamite charge blew up as they placed it on a highway bridge 100 
miles east of lima a third was seriously injured 
the highest absentee ratio was registered in the ayacucho a 
shining path stronghold 235 miles southeast of lima in the andean 
highlands where 38 percent of voters stayed away 
three quarters of the votes cast in ayacucho were blank or null 
compared to about 10 percent nationwide according to the respected 
polling firm datum repression by the military is particularly 
severe in the region and human rights violations are frequent 
vargas llosas campaign often had the aspect of a crusade as he 
condemned the collectivist programs of president alan garcia 
and leftist candidates 
many peruvians blame garcia who is barred by the constitution 
from serving consecutive fiveyear terms for the severe economic 
crisis and growing political violence tearing apart this country of 
22 million 
they point in particular to his attempt to nationalize the 
countrys banks after discouraging foreign investment by dictating 
his own terms for repaying outstanding loans 
inflation is running at more than 2000 percent annually and 
more than 18000 people most of them civilians have been killed 
in 10 years of violence between the shining path and government 
security forces 
vargas llosa has repeatedly said he put aside his writing to 
help his country but some of his former backers were turned off by 
the lavish campaign waged by the novelists centerright democratic 
front coalition 
appearing together in a downtown hotel vargas llosa and 
fujimori applauded the massive voter turnout an apparent rejection 
of garcias governing aprista party 
vargas llosa invited fujimori to join him in frank 
conversation to discuss a possible accord to avoid a second 
round but fujimori said he would not step aside 
there has been in this first round two proposals for change 
fujimori said i believe a second round is necessary to debate 
our proposals the verdict should be the publics 
sundays vote indicated the next president will face a divided 
congress no party gained a working majority among the 60 senators 
and 180 representatives

the japanese community is as perplexed as the 
rest of peru by alberto fujimori who vaulted from relative 
obscurity into a runoff vote in the presidential election in a 
matter of weeks 
unofficial returns after sundays voting showed fujimori had 
forced a second round of voting by garnering enough ballots to deny 
the longtime favorite novelist mario vargas llosa a simple 
majority 
until the final days of the campaign hardly anyone knew of the 
51yearold agronomist six weeks ago his own polls showed him 
with less that one percent support 
his popularity is very surprising said juan iida publisher 
of a japanese language newspaper in lima we didnt even know who 
he was 
fujimori a former rector of the national agricultural 
university served for two years as an agricultural advisor to the 
government of president alan garcia he is married with four 
children 
one of almost 100000 peruvians of japanese descent fujimoro 
has played on common japanese stereotypes in his shoestring 
campaign whose slogan promises honesty work technology 
he also has not discouraged the belief that he will attract 
japanese aid and investment to this impoverished warravaged 
country 
the japanese community however remains unimpressed by 
fujimoro according to pollsters japanese peruvians believe 
fujimori does not reflect the values of their community and is too 
peruvian 
i doubt he has any real program said amelia morimoto of the 
japanese peruvian cultural center his candidacy seems very 
improvised 
indeed most of fujimoros campaign workers are youths from 
limas poor districts and his political movement called simply 
change 90 has only two sparsely furnished offices in lima 
fujimoro who has no political experience says he sold his 
house car and a tractor to fund the campaign and often travels 
without bodyguards because he says he cant afford them 
some people who worked under fujimori when he was university 
rector from 1984 to 1989 have questioned his ability to govern 
they dispute his claim he left the school with a 7 million budget 
surplus 
if elected he would be the first japanese peruvian to occupy a 
high government post 
what is important for japanese peruvians is that this may lead 
to wider acceptance by the other peruvians ms morimoto said 
fujimoros parents came to lima before world war ii from 
kumamoto japan in a wave of immigration that began in 1899 most 
japanese families arrived in peru to work on cotton and sugar 
plantations along the coast and many now own businesses and 
factories or work as doctors lawyers and engineers 
fujimori seems as surprised as anyone at his sudden popularity 
im not a dreamer but yes i propose to become president of 
peru he said recently

a few years ago charges of police 
brutality made headlines in the border town of mcallen texas 
today residents come to a neighborhood ministation to drop off 
plates of food for officers 
sgt belinda cowan credits the smoother relations to the 
departments switch three years ago to community policing a 
philosophy that is the subject of a conference today and tuesday at 
michigan state university 
officers may patrol on foot staff a small office or drive a 
patrol car but the key to community policing is facetoface 
contact with neighborhood residents said robert trojanowicz 
director of michigan states school of criminal justice 
cowan said the results are striking 
were seeing tremendous support from citizens because were 
working together as partners she said its no longer im 
the police just the facts maam they are a part of our 
department 
about 300 cities use some form of community policing and get 
similar results trojanowicz said 
community policing advocates planned to describe at the 
conference how this decentralized form of police work which became 
popular in the late 1970s can stop drugs from overwhelming 
neighborhoods 
officers in community policing programs work in the same 
neighborhood for at least a year getting to know the areas 
problems and enlisting the help of citizens in fighting crime 
fixing up the neighborhood and other programs 
with this personalized approach to police work officers have 
more contact more communication with the public trojanowicz 
said trust is built up and information is exchanged that would 
not otherwise be exchanged and information is the lifeblood of 
police work 
community police officers try to get to the root of problems as 
in aurora colo where police had frequent reports of womens 
purses being ripped off in car breakins at a popular nightclub in 
the denver suburb 
typical police response would have been to go out and take 
reports on stolen purses over and over and never go further said 
aurora police chief jerry williams 
instead the aurora officer encouraged the nightclub owner to 
build lockers where women could safely leave their purses while 
dancing the crimes stopped 
police mobilize citizens into neighborhood watch groups 
encourage people to testify in court find out which children 
arent attending school and pressure city leaders to tear down 
dilapidated buildings that are eyesores or havens for crime 
that can mean less time for responding to minor complaints like 
barking dogs trojanowicz said adding citizens are encouraged to 
handle those things themselves 
in mcallen police received more reports of crime in the first 
year after community policing began possibly because citizens were 
more willing to file reports cowan said 
the negative rap on community policing is its public 
relations grin and wave it humors people and doesnt cure 
anything trojanowicz said the focus of the conference is to 
show it is real policing and to show it in fact can get rid of drug 
dealers 
some police fear for their safety if they spend less time in 
patrol cars and more time in direct contact with citizens but 
trojanowicz said citizens are more likely to come to the aid of an 
officer they know 
studies have shown that as officers have become more 
personalized if they are in danger its a little more difficult 
for citizens to be aloof he said he has a stake in the 
neighborhood and the neighborhood has a stake in him

cardinal john j oconnor defended the roman 
catholic churchs hiring of a public relations concern to launch an 
antiabortion campaign saying the move is neither a waste of money 
nor unusually political 
we believe that the most critical issue in the united states 
is the problem of abortion and if we believe that then we should 
try to use the best possible means to communicate oconnor said 
after sunday mass at st patricks cathedral 
oconnor announced thursday that the nations roman catholic 
bishops had engaged a public relations concern hill amp knowlton 
and a polling company the wirthlin group to conduct a campaign 
opposing abortion 
but he said that contrary to some recent reports no contract 
has been signed with the companies 
oconnor chairman of the bishops committee for prolife 
activities said no price tag has been put on the project but some 
reports have said the bishops are expected to spend 3 million to 
5 million on the effort 
funds would be raised from private individuals and 
organizations and would not detract from existing programs said 
oconnors spokesman joe zwilling 
some critics have charged that the money going to the project 
could be better spent on the poor but oconnor said the catholic 
church spends billions of dollars annually on care for the needy 
and homeless 
im not sure why the criticism except again i find that 
whenever i do anything or say anything about any public policy 
problem except abortion theres practically no criticism he 
said 
the catholic bishops have hired media consultants for events 
like pope john paul iis visit to the united states in 1987 but 
never before for the abortion issue 
ive heard that christ wouldnt have used a communications 
program oconnor said well christ never established a child 
care institution or an orphanage christ was able to work miracles 
to feed people i cant do that i have to raise money to do that

the foreign ministry said today that it was 
expelling an american diplomat in retaliation for the expulsion 
from the united states of an iraqi diplomat accused by washington 
of involvement in a murder plot 
the ministry announcement carried by the official iraqi news 
agency did not name the american to be expelled 
an unidentifed spokesman for the ministry was quoted as saying 
the accusation against the iraqi diplomat has no basis in truth 
the source said the american action was part of repeated 
hysterical campaigns to harm iraq in order to serve the aggressive 
purposes of israel 
in washington on saturday the state department said it had 
expelled an iraqi diplomat posted at the united nations because of 
his suspected role in an alleged plot to murder two opponents of 
the baghdad government 
the diplomat who was not identified was expelled for abuse 
of his privileges of residence in the united states said state 
department spokeswoman anita stockman 
given the nature of the diplomats actions it would be 
inappropriate for the government of iraq to take any retaliatory 
action the spokeswoman said 
she said the department could not provide more specific 
information except to confirm the expulsion was linked to an 
investigation in california but government sources said on 
condition of anonymity that the expulsion was linked to a plot to 
assassinate two iraqi opposition members in the united states 
a newspaper in california identified the targets of the plot as 
sargon dadesho a leader of the assyrian community in californias 
central valley and an unidentified kurdish leader 
iraq has been the focus of international criticism for two 
months over a series of incidents the latest was president saddam 
husseins statement that he would use binary chemical weapons if 
attacked by israel chemical weapons have been banned under a 1925 
international agreement 
saddams threats came after iraq ignored international pleas and 
hanged an iranianborn british journalist whom baghdad branded an 
israeli spy they also followed accusations by the united states 
and britain that iraq had tried to smuggle atomic bomb triggers 
into the country a charge iraq has denied 
meanwhile the qatari newspaper alraya quoted informed sources 
as saying president hosni mubarak of egypt relayed to saddam a 
message from president bush in which he said the us 
administration was no party to the propaganda campaign against 
iraq 
alraya said the two arab leaders considered bushs message a 
positive response that calls for selfcontrol and nonescalation of 
the propaganda war 
baghdad last expelled an american diplomat in november 1988 
haywood rankin head of the embassys political section was 
kicked out for alleged close contacts with iraqs kurdish minority 
which has been fighting for autonomy for 50 years

machines were shut down after an unexpectedly high volume of

the liberal republic of slovenia 
held yugoslavias first free multiparty elections since 1945 and 
the presidential candidate who favored a cautious approach to 
secession won the most votes 
but former communist milan kucan did not gain an absolute 
majority in sundays balloting and faces an april 22 runoff vote 
with joze pucnik a former political prisoner of the demos 
opposition coalition returns showed today 
political analysts predicted a neckandneck race between 
pucnik who advocates quick slovenian independence from yugoslavia 
and kucan who has called for a more cautious political approach 
about 75 percent of eligible voters cast ballots choosing among 
17 parties for a new slovenian parliament and among four candidates 
for president 
with 90 percent of ballots counted kucan led with 445 percent 
of the vote to 261 percent for pucnik independent candidate ivan 
kramberger won 188 percent and liberal party candidate marko 
demsar took 105 percent 
the firstround results suggest that slovenians have opted for 
a peaceful transition from a singleparty monopoly to a 
parliamentary democracy said kucan an engineer of the 
republics move toward democracy 
pucnik who spent seven years in slovenian prisons in the 1950s 
for his opposition to communism said he would win the runoff 
because those who voted for kramberger and demsar will now 
probably vote for me 
early returns from sundays balloting indicated the slovenian 
communists who recently renamed themselves the party of democratic 
renewal would be the largest single party in the republics 
parliament but would face a tough demos coalition of five 
conservative parties 
the former communists who have also broken with the national 
communist party leadership because it has resisted democratic 
reform won about 21 percent of the vote in balloting for the 
republics 240seat parliament with the five demos parties getting 
about 35 percent returns showed 
official results of parliamentary voting were not expected until 
tuesday due to a slow and complicated counting process 
yugoslavias president janez drnovsek a slovene said after 
voting in ljubljana that he hoped the whole country would hold its 
first free elections for federal parliament by years end 
elections in slovenia the richest and most liberal of the six 
yugoslav republics represent a sign of the democracy drive that 
cannot be stopped in yugoslavia drnovsek said 
slovenians have shown an increased desire to secede from 
yugoslavia because they are unhappy with resistance to reform in 
much of the rest of the country especially serbia 
slovenians have moved toward democracy despite harsh criticism 
and economic boycotts from serbia the largest yugoslav republic a 
bastion of centrallized control where the leaders demand continued 
communist party dominance 
croatia the secondlargest republic is scheduled to hold free

political pundits who like to point out 
what a difference one vote can make can now use this small texas 
town as an example 
residents voted 5150 on saturday to allow the sales of package 
beer and wine in an election that drew more ballots than any in the 
towns history only three registered voters did not participate 
and those three who failed to vote are bound to be badgered a 
bit by voters from the losing side mayor jim clinkscales said 
i know one of those who didnt vote clinkscales said and 
it wouldnt be too hard to narrow it down to find out the others 
opposition to beer and wine sales at the towns two grocery 
stores came primarily from members of the towns three churches 
those arguing in favor of going wet tried to convince 
neighbors already struggling under hefty sewer tax bills that 
liquor and beer sales would provide badly needed revenue for the 
town of 282 people about 30 miles south of fort worth 
i really didnt take much of a stand on it said 
clinkscales who refused to divulge which way he voted but i 
will say im going to be glad to see more tax coming in from it 
a lot of people said this is going to bring us heavier traffic 
and people throwing trash in our town but theres already a place 
that sells beer a halfmile west of our town now and people drive 
through here and toss down trash and we dont get any revenue from 
it

the dollar closed sharply lower against the 
japanese yen today helping to push the tokyo stock exchanges key 
index above 30000 points for the first time since late march 
the dollar closed at 15645 yen down 102 yen from fridays 
close of 15747 yen it opened at 15580 yen and then rose trading 
between 15560 yen and 15690 yen during the day 
bolstered by the yens recovery the 225share nikkei stock 
average rose 111915 points or 382 percent to close at 
3039793 its fourth largest singleday advance ever the nikkei 
last closed above 30000 points on march 29 when it ended the day 
at 3102616 
the advance extended a rebound begun on friday when the nikkei 
index rose 102972 points in its fifthlargest singleday advance 
the dollar opened lower in tokyo after wildly fluctuating 
between 1555015950 in oceanian markets mainly sydney that 
opened earlier than tokyo dealers said 
they said the dollar fell because of expectations of central 
bank intervention to prop up the faltering japanese yen in the wake 
of talks among economic policymakers of the major industrialized 
nations known as the group of seven in paris this weekend 
monetary authorities from britain canada france west germany 
italy japan and the united states agreed saturday that the yens 
recent downswing in world currency markets could have undesirable 
consequences 
they also promised to keep the exchange markets under review 
and renewed their commitment to coordinate economic policies 
including cooperation on exchange markets 
nihon keizai shimbun a leading japanese economic journal 
reported on its front page this morning that central banks from g7 
would conduct coordinated dollarselling interventions during 
todays tradings to support the yen 
the dollar which traded at 14340 yen at the end of last year 
surged almost 20 yen during the last three months to 160 yen before 
falling back slightly 
many analysts believe however that some g7 countries are 
reluctant to help japan prop up its currency because they see the 
yens weakness as a domestic problem expectations of possible 
intervention to curb the dollars rising value they say are 
temporarily helping the yen 
the dollars uptrend will slow down temporarily because market 
players are now reluctant to push it up because they fear 
intervention but the dollar will soon start rising again said 
kenzo shinomiya a dealer with fuji bank 
he predicted the dollar would fall only to 15450 yen before 
resuming its climb 
the rebound in prices on the stock exchange after three months 
of almost continual decline was directly linked to the yens surge 
against the dollar traders said 
the nikkei average has declined over 20 percent or 851794 
points since the end of last year 
kozo hasunuma a trader with yamaichi securities co attributed 
the indexs surge today to a g7 statement that stressed the 
importance of the yens stability which he said reassured stock 
investors 
the indexs increase slowed down in the afternoon when some 
market players sold issues for profittaking but as a whole their 
buying incentive was strong throughout the day he said 
many investors believe the market bottomed out last week when 
the nikkei fell briefly below the 28000point level he added 
an estimated 800 million shares changed hands in one of the most 
active trading days in recent weeks 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 japanese 
government bond closed at 8673 points up from fridays close of 
8638 as bond investors were reassured by the yens strength 
against the dollar the no 199s yield fell to 7205 percent from 
7275 percent on friday 
meanwhile bank of japan governor yasushi mieno told a news 
conference today that the yens weakness was due to speculation and 
that speculative pressure in th market would be met by coordinated 
g7 action 
he enphasized that the paris g7 meeting was the first in which 
the yen was specificaly mentioned in the communique 
mieno stressed that the g7 nations would take appropriate and 
timely measures in accordance with the communique and said he 
hopes the market would interpret the g7 statement in that light 
he said there is no reason for the yen to weaken considering the 
strength of japans economic fundamentals

investigators picked through the 
charred remains of a residential hotel looking for more bodies as 
the death toll in the fire rose to six 
searchers using dogs and heavy equipment continued sifting 
debris in the charred hulk of the 39yearold fontana hotel today 
after finding the fifth and sixth bodies sunday 
the number of guests unaccounted for after the fastmoving fire 
swept through the 102room hotel friday dropped to eight 
more than a score of federal state city and county agency 
officials began their search at the top and along the sides of the 
gutted building 
our main concern now is to get the bodies out but safely so 
that we dont risk the teams said miami beach police detective 
jim hyde spokesman for the search effort 
the fifth body was unidentifiable even as to gender it was 
found sunday morning when a bulldozer pushed aside some debris 
hyde said 
at midafternoon the sixth body that of a woman was found in 
the rear of the blackened remnants of the hotel 
the fourth body discovered saturday remained in the building 
throughout the weekend dr joseph davis chief medical examiner 
for dade county said searchers couldnt immediately get to it 
because of dangerous debris 
a bathtub and a rooftop tank dangled above the spot where that 
body was found and a weakened wall remained standing nearby he 
said 
only one of the six victims dr joseph wels 92 has been 
identified davis said all bodies still in the hotel would 
eventually be found 
about 100 people many of them elderly retirees were seasonal 
or yearround residents at the fontana survivors had to grope down 
dark smoky hallways or jump out windows to flee the fire 
the fontana complied with current fire regulations according to 
city officials and was equipped with smoke detectors in each room 
but the hotel did not have sprinklers which are required by law 
only beginning in 1991 
besides the death toll 21 hotel residents were taken to three 
area hospitals friday for treatment and five remained hospitalized 
in good condition over the weekend

of the ferry norrona which was carrying 297 people from wales 
dublin irelandbased b and i shipping line said in a statement 
it did not elaborate but the companys marine superintendent 
capt peter mckenna told irish radio that b and i was fairly 
certain about this he said the company believes mattresses or 
lighted paper were used to start the fire police were interviewing 
all those on board 
the ferry was eight miles off the welsh coast en route from 
milford haven 180 miles west of london to rosslare ireland when 
the fire was discovered firefighters and crew members controlled 
the blaze within two hours of the captains mayday call said coast 
guard spokesman george clarke

corridors and cabins 10 of which were damaged 
i took the skin off my knees and toes but thank god we got 
out alive said fred jenkinson who was asleep in his cabin when 
he heard shouts and smelled smoke 
i am sure the terrible fire on the scandinavian star at the 
weekend was going through a lot of peoples minds suddenly we all 
seemed to be in a similar situation 
about 150 people aboard the scandinavian star ferry were killed 
when fire broke out saturday as the ship sailed in the north sea on 
an overnight trip from norway to denmark investigators said they 
suspected arson 
we were in the cabin when we heard a shout and the whole place 
was filled with smoke it was quite frightening but there was 
absolutely no panic said olive leader who was traveling with 
her sister and children 
another passenger delia reynolds said she heard screaming but 
no alarms 
crew members were busy going around saying everyone up on 
deck go up on deck the smoke was awful but there was no panic 
mrs reynolds said

damage

three israeli soldiers have testified 
that they were told army orders to break the bones of palestinian 
detainees came from the upper echelons of the military 
the soldiers reserve sgts guy neeman amiram avirosh and 
ronen ferber were called as defense witnesses in the court 
martial of col yehuda meir the former commander of israeli troops 
in the nablus area of the west bank 
meir 38 who left the army last year is charged with ordering 
soldiers to break the limbs of palestinians taken into custody in 
the west bank villages of beita and hawwara in january 1988 the 
trial began last month 
col menashe finkelstein the armys chief prosecutor suggested 
in crossexamination that orders to break bones originated from 
officers in the field but last month meir was quoted by the 
hadashot newspaper as suggesting the orders originated from someone 
with a higher military rank 
the entire leadership of the israeli defense forces from the 
defense minister through the chief of staff and other commanders 
will have to answer questions they may wish to silence he 
was quoted as saying 
at the third session of his trial meir sat impassively often 
smiling to himself as the three soldiers detailed the brutal 
actions in beita on jan 19 and in hawarra two days later 
according to avirosh the beita incident began when soldiers 
went to investigate a firebomb attack he said meir appealed to 
village leaders for calm but gangs of youths blocked the roads and 
hurled stones 
he said the soldiers rounded up 12 arabs who were handcuffed and 
in some cases blindfolded put on a bus and driven out of town 
after several miles they were ordered off and beaten very 
badly he said 
he said the company commander identified only as eldad told 
the soldiers after the incident it was not easy for him to give 
us this order 
avirosh recalled eldad said it was immoral but the order came 
from high up i think he said from the defense minister 
avirosh referred to yitzhak rabin who resigned as defense 
minister last month when the labor party pulled out of the ruling 
coalition and brought down the government 
on jan 19 1988 rabin told a news conference the army had 
orders to quell riots with force power and blows he has 
denied he authorized soldiers to break prisoners bones 
rabins spokesman eitan haber said rabin gave permission only 
to beat demonstrators during pursuit 
he never said that we should break bones haber said to 
beat to hit but not to break he never said break 
ferber said the next day the company commander told the 
unitwe are going someplace for an unusual action for the purpose 
of breaking arms and legs 
he said this was part of a new ironfist policy and these were 
not his orders but came from further up i felt that he himself was 
unhappy with them 
according to the testimony the village leader in hawwara 
rounded up palestinians wanted by the army then enroute to the 
detention center the detainees were taken from the bus and beaten 
with sticks and rifle 
afterward ferber said eldad told the soldiers all the other 
methods that were tried before hadnt worked so we thought that 
breaking arms and legs would be a longerlasting deterrent 
the next day the unit was told the policy had been nullified

tens of thousands of soviet georgians 
rallied in tbilisi today on the anniversary of the slaying of 19 
proindependence protesters by soviet forces and burned the 
regions military chief in effigy 
there was a partial reenactment of last years 4 am assault 
when troops armed with shotguns shovels and toxic gas charged onto 
rustaveli boulevard in the georgian capital 
radio stations broadcast the sound of rumbling tanks and ringing 
bells 
from midnight sunday through early today people carrying 
flowers and candles thronged the boulevard about 100000 georgians 
stood with raised fists for a silent moment to honor the dead 
later demonstrators burned an effigy of col gen in 
rodionov regional military commander in front of the citys 
government house which overlooks the broad square where soviet 
troops moved in 
nineteen people died in the clash a year ago and another was 
killed by troops in a separate incident thousands suffered 
ailments from the gas 
the assault caused a nationwide furor raised doubts about 
president mikhail s gorbachevs proclaimed policy of not using 
troops to stifle dissent and brought many georgians into the 
battle for independence 
the memorial protest on sunday and today had more an air of 
defiance than mourning most speakers spoke of the impetus the 
deaths gave the republics burgeoning independence movement 
this is a day of great sorrow but also a day of great 
victory said zviad gamsakhurdia on this day the georgian 
soul was revived 
april 9 was the beginning of the national democratic 
revolution of georgia which is continuing said gamsakhurdia 
the dean of georgian dissidents 
demonstrations were planned for later today in front of the 
regional military headquarters and at the central stadium 
in leningrad on sunday about 30000 people gathered on historic 
palace square to mark the anniversary journalist maxim korzlov 
said he said the crowd lit candles and stood in silence 
the square is the site of the 1905 bloody sunday incident in 
which czarist forces fired on a crowd of demonstrators 
today we recall the event of another bloody sunday taking 
place a year ago on the ninth of april anatoly sobchak a 
national legislator told the demonstrators 
gorbachev offered condolences sunday expressing his respect 
for georgia and its industrious people who are distinguished for 
their glorious traditions original culture and friendliness 
but georgian activists dismissed the gesture 
i believe hes sorry for people but he cant be sincere on the 
government level because after tbilisi came baku said a member 
of the georgian peoples front a new moderate political group he 
did not give his name 
antiarmenian riots broke out in baku on jan 13 and soviet 
troops stormed the city a week later by official count about 200 
people were killed 
redwhiteandblack georgian flags flew from many tbilisi 
buildings on sunday and women and children some wearing black 
headbands placed red carnations and other flowers on the steps 
before the arches of government house 
the steps glowed with the tiny flames of memorial candles and 
church bells rang banners held by protesters read better to die 
in the battle for freedom than to live as a slave and down 
with the occupiers 
gamsakhurdia estimated that before april 9 1989 only a small 
minority of georgians favored full independence from moscow now 
he believes 90 percent of the people are on his side 
proindependence politicians in georgia a caucasus republic of 
5 million have scored major victories in recent weeks on march 9 
the georgian parliament condemned georgias forced annexation by 
the soviet union and demanded negotiations on the restoration of 
independence 
later last month georgian radicals persuaded lawmakers to put 
off local elections thus giving newly legalized opposition parties 
time to gain support 
but the opposition movement appears badly splintered a rift 
exists between those who favor a balticstyle parliamentary fight 
and extremists who want mass civil disobedience and boycotts of 
state elections and the soviet draft

toward the royal palace

foreign minister pashupati rani said sunday that elections for 
the yetundissolved national assembly would be held soon but gave 
no date 
for 50 days hundreds of thousands of people had taken part in 
demonstrations for a new political system in nepal where the 
monarchy wielded almost absolute power 
there had been demonstrations in the past but support was 
limited to students and a small circle of political agitators the 
current campaign drew doctors lawyers and teachers who went on 
strike 
then the pilots of royal air nepal walked off their jobs 
followed by staffers in several staterun banks and even government 
ministries 
before police opened fire on demonstrators friday at least 16 
people were killed in the ballooning movement 
but fridays bloodshed jolted the normally tranquil country 
where the largely illiterate peasantry had revered the monarch as a 
reincarnation of the hindu god shiva not since 1846 when feuding 
members of the royal household battled had nepal seen such 
bloodshed 
birendra 44 is the heir of the shaha dynasty that has held the

the knock at the door was supposed to 
be the delivery man bringing more beer to a party at the manila 
city jail instead 15 rebel soldiers burst in and freed lt col 
billy bibit 
sundays escape by bibit jailed on charges of trying to 
overthrow the government for his alleged role in the dec 19 
failed coup was just the latest example of prisoners taking 
advantage of lax security to win freedom 
president corazon aquino ordered a nationwide manhunt for bibit 
a presidential spokeswoman lourdes sytangco described mrs aquino 
as angry and promised we will be seeing more forceful action 
in this case 
the manila city jail superintendent was relieved and three 
jailers including a deputy warden were arrested for negligence 
after sundays escape 
and today an air force captain held for trying to overthrow the 
government escaped eluding guards at villamor air base sources 
said on condition of anonymity capt rogelio seradoy had during a 
failed august 1987 coup piloted the helicopter in which coup leader 
lt col gregorio honasan escaped 
in the philippines great escapes are better described as 
great escapades 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa admitted recently 
that he was displeased with security at jails and stockades 
nationwide 
but de villa said it was difficult to enforce strict security 
because filipino culture frowns on rules which prohibit conjugal 
visits fraternization between guards and inmates and liberal 
furloughs to attend funerals graduations and other family 
occasions 
police said bibit escaped after guards inmates and women 
visitors gathered and drank beer to celebrate the birthday of the 
deputy warden maj manuel roxas 
in november 1988 the chief of the communist rebel army romulo 
kintanar slipped away from a birthday celebration for a former 
jailer and resumed command of the new peoples army 
the fact that such an important prisoner was allowed out of his 
cell albeit under guard was suprising considering the flap 
surrounding honasans escape six months earlier 
honasan had been held aboard a prison ship in manila bay because 
he led the august 1987 attempt to topple mrs aquino despite 
assurances honasan had been neutralized the charismatic officer 
convinced sailors to help him escape in april 1988 
he remains at large and is believed to have played a major role 
in the failed december coup which claimed the lives of at least 
113 people and left more than 600 injured 
another alleged conspirator lt col eduardo matillano slipped 
away in 1988 when he was allowed to leave a stockade to visit a 
dentist matillano was arrested a few months later when waiters 
spotted him dining with a wellknown pornographic movie star 
sometimes prisoners have been allowed to leave jails by corrupt 
guards to commit crimes in 1987 a suspect was arrested after 
witnesses identified him as one of the killers of local governments 
secretary jaime ferrer 
it turned out the suspect was supposed to have been in the 
national prison serving a life sentence for murder he had been 
released a few days before ferrers murder to testify in a trial 
a judge and the warden were later fired after investigators 
learned there was no trial and the release order was bogus 
such practices are not unique to the aquino administration in 
may 1985 during the late president ferdinand marcos term a 
senior communist leader saturnino ocampo was allowed to leave 
prison to vote in the national press club elections 
ocampo a former journalist slipped away from his guards he 
was arrested last july ironically he had been living less than a 
block from the police headquarters in suburban makati

the winner will take on republican nominee clayton williams in 
the november election 
mattox the state attorney general accused ms richards on 
sunday of being treated for cocaine addiction 10 years ago the 
latest and strongest in a series of druguse allegations that have 
dominated the runoff campaign 
im saying that she used cocaine at the age of 46 and 
marijuana and she used other drugs mattox said in an interview 
broadcast on cbstvs face the nation the attorney general 
said he obtained the information from mutual friends he declined to 
identify 
ms richards the state treasurer phoned the program to deny 
shed ever sought treatment for cocaine use but declined to appear 
on the show 
she dismissed the charge saturday when word of the pretaped 
interview reached her while campaigning in henderson jimmys 
just going nuts ms richards said 
last week three people claimed they saw mattox smoke marijuana 
on separate occasions in the 1970s mattox denied the accusations 
ms richards has answered questions about illegal drug use by 
saying she has not used a moodaltering drug in 10 years

midland san antonio and waco today mattox was spending the day 
before the election in beaumont dallas hurst longview lufkin 
texarkana and tyler 
the candidates have apologized in recent days for the negative 
tone of the campaign and said the democrats would unite to face 
williams 
weve had a family squabble i think the family will come back 
together again because theres more of us in the family than 
outside the family mattox said in houston 
but he said deep down in my heart i dont think ann richards 
should be governor of texas 
i believe her candidacy is a reflection of a social phenomenon 
that is taking place and it doesnt have anything to do with her 
ability to really make decisions 
mattox said the social phenomenon he meant was the demanding 
the election of a woman governor 
ms richards said she would mend fences with mattox and expect 
his help if she becomes the democratic nominee she said however 
mattox probably wouldnt have a place in her administration 
his style of management and operation is not something i 
want ms richards said in dallas 
a poll published sunday by the houston chronicle and the dallas 
morning news showed ms richards and mattox in a tight race 
of 759 democrats who said theyd vote in the runoff 44 percent 
backed ms richards and 38 percent mattox and 16 percent said they 
were undecided according to the poll the telephone survey by the 
university of houston had a margin of error of 4 percentage points

in the countrys third parliamentary elections in 10 months the 
conservative new democratic party won 150 of parliaments 300 
seats falling one seat short of the majority needed to govern 
alone 
new democrat leader constantine mitsotakis says hell 
nevertheless try to form a government lacking an outright 
majority however it was not clear if he would have to turn to a 
smaller party or an independent in his bid to become premier 
a victory by the new democrats who fell just short of a 
majority in inconclusive june and november elections would end a 
debilitating political deadlock that has left greece unable to cope 
with a crumbling economy and growing urban terrorism 
the conservatives last held power in 1981 when they lost in a 
landslide to the panhellenic socialist movement pasok of former 
premier andreas papandreou both pasok and the conservatives have

elections in the former soviet bloc conservatives won big in east 
germanys march 18 vote falling just short of a majority in both

the liberal republic of slovenia held yugoslavias first free 
multiparty elections since 1945 with the presidential candidate 
who favored a cautious approach to secession winning the most votes 
but former communist milan kucan did not gain an absolute 
majority and faces an april 22 runoff vote with joze pucnik a 
former political prisoner who advocates quick slovenian 
independence from yugoslavia 
early returns from sundays balloting indicated the slovenian 
communists who recently followed an east european trend and 
renamed themselves would be the largest single party in the 
republics parliament but would face a tough fiveparty 
conservative coalition led by pucnik 
the former communists have broken with the national communist 
party leadership because it has resisted democratic reform 
slovenians have shown an increased desire to secede from the 
loose and ethnically diverse yugoslav federation because they are 
unhappy with resistance to reform in much of the rest of the 
country especially serbia 
serbia the largest yugoslav republic is a bastion of 
centralized control where the leaders demand continued communist

in a speech to a sixnation 
conference on central europe today president vaclav havel proposed 
creation of a new security commission that would gradually replace 
nato and the warsaw pact 
it is impossible to return to the europe of the past and 
therefore a timetable should be agreed to shape the europe of the 
future havel said in outlining his prescription for curbing the 
continents historic conflicts 
the dissident playwright turned president suggested the 
bratislava conference find ways to build a solid wall against all 
expressions of nationalism and chauvinism said his spokesman 
michael zantovsky 
the unique daylong meeting gathered representatives of poland 
hungary and czechoslovakia with austria italy and hungary 
attending as observers it seemed unlikely to reach any decisions 
on its broad agenda partly because hungary was represented by 
officials of the reformed communist leadership that was soundly 
defeated in sundays free elections 
jozsef antall the leader of the victorious hungarian democratic 
forum and the likely new premier of hungary was invited but sent 
the partys vice president ferenc kulin hungarian officials said 
outlining 10 questions to the closeddoor meeting havel invited 
consideration of a proposal to create a new alleuropean security 
commission this year zantovsky told reporters 
the idea was first outlined by foreign minister jiri dienstbier 
at a warsaw pact meeting in prague on march 17 when the 
czechoslovaks said it drew a mixed response the coolest reaction 
coming from the soviets 
both superpowers have reacted somewhat coldly to the insistence 
by havel and dienstbier that europes military blocs are outdated 
and should be disbanded 
czechoslovakia wants to use the 35nation helsinki process 
involving the united states canada and all european nations except 
albania as the basis for the new security commission and for new 
agreements to preserve peace on the worlds most heavily armed 
continent 
havel who called todays conference for poland hungary and 
czechoslovakia to ponder cooperation in their return to europe 
proposed the three pool efforts to join the 12nation european 
economic community 
he also said they should take a joint stand on the warsaw pact 
and soviet economic bloc comecon 
all three countries are emerging from more than four decades of 
soviet domination and communist rule uniting could help them 
combat the influence likely to be wielded by a united germany 
however such cooperation could be marred both by conflicting 
interests such as those of debtridden poland and relatively 
wealthy czechoslovakia and by the ethnic conflicts that have 
clouded eastern europes democratic reforms 
those conflicts could threaten european peace as they did 
between the two world wars and for centuries before 
eastern europes worst ethnic conflict currently is the tension 
between the hungarian minority and romanians in transylvania where 
an explosion of strife last month left at least six people dead in 
tirgu mures 
the victory of the centerright democratic forum in sundays 
hungarian elections is likely also to keep the fate of the 
hungarian minorities in romania czechoslovakia and yugoslavia high 
on budapests diplomatic agenda 
the outgoing socialist government in hungary already has asked 
prague to improve the rights of the 500000 hungarians living in 
slovakia foreign ministry sources suggested demands for 
hungarianlanguage schools would be granted if matched by similar 
rights for the tiny slovak minority in hungary 
in pushing their agenda for a new europe havel and dienstbier 
have been able to draw on their yearslong contacts with former 
solidarity activists now wielding power in poland and to a lesser 
extent on ties to onetime dissidents in hungary

many residents of the sleepy 
neighborhoods near the walt disney co are grumpy about towering 
additions to the firms new headquarters and theyre not bashful 
about saying so 
obviously disney always does things their own way with a 
flair for the dramatic said jeff vander borght a burbank 
planning board member but im afraid its totally out of scale 
for the neighborhood 
this week a huge veil comes down at the new corporate 
headquarters to reveal 19foot tall renderings of happy grumpy 
sleepy sneezy dopey bashful and doc perched on the third story 
the statues appear to hold up the fifthstory roof 
alan epstein vice president of disney development corp and 
burbanks city planner rick pruetz said the building conforms 
strictly to city codes so no public hearings were held on the 
design 
thats a pity said vander borght an architect who lives nearby 
it gives a whole new meaning to the word dwarf he said 
stretch dwarfs were going to be known as the city of the huge 
dwarfs 
abutting the sprawling burbank lot on two sides are quiet 
residential neighborhoods where neat bungalows sit on treelined 
streets yards sport neatly trimmed hedges barbecue grills and 
pools 
founder walt disney allowed no identification of the company on 
the studio property the studio gate carried only a small plaque 
identifying the nature of the enterprise inside 
walt didnt want tourists popping in to interfere with 
production said a longtime employee who asked not to be 
identified and he didnt want people mistakenly believing that 
disneyland was in burbank 
however michael eisner changed all that when he became disney 
chairman in 1984 now the studio lots huge water tower sports a 
picture of mickey mouse and soon the dwarfs characters from 
disneys 1937 animated classic snow white and the seven dwarfs

police investigators today breached the 
blackened interior of the scandinavia star ferry and found 
childrens bodies raising the estimated death toll from a weekend 
fire to 170 a spokesman said 
the suspicious blaze which broke out early saturday while the 
ship was traveling from norway to denmark with at least 500 aboard 
was extinguished sunday night officials said 
a team of officers today entered cabins previously blocked by 
fire and searing heat said police inspector lief skoglund 
when they went inside the boat they saw lots and lots of dead 
bodies maybe 100 more said skoglund there may 170 dead on 
board he said making clear that it was rough estimate 
police earlier estimated the number of victims on the 
20yearold vessel at around 150 but said that did not count 
children who would not appear on any passenger list 
the remains of 75 victims were removed from the blackened shell 
of the 470foot danishowned ferry before the fire was 
extinguished skoglund said 
police listed 345 survivors but it was uncertain how many 
people had been aboard when the fire broke out the captain said 
395 passengers and 97 crewmen were on board leaving 147 people 
dead or missing and presumed dead but that figure did not include 
children under age 7 said onso 
an accurate count of the victims was expected to take several 
days 
the ship caught fire before dawn saturday on the north sea 
voyage from oslo norway to frederikshavn denmark 
the captain of the ship denied improper behavior today as 
reports surfaced that he and his officers abandoned the burning 
vessel as rescue efforts got under way 
district police chief roar onso said a commission of officials 
from sweden norway and denmark would investigate the disaster 
parallel to the police investigation focusing on suspicion of arson 
we are working on the assumption that the fire was arranged 
said magnar aukrust assistant police chief in oslo norway in 
that case it is a real disaster caused by one or several 
persons he said 
onso said sunday that the investigation would probe all 
possibilities to the case including any connection to three 
previous fires on north sea ferries but onso said it was difficult 
to see a link between the fires which occurred on different routes 
on ships from different companies 
another suspicious fire early today broke out on a ferry bound 
from wales to ireland killing one person and injuring 25 the 
vessels owners said passengers reported crawling through thick 
smoke to safety 
the fire started in two sleeping cabins in an unoccupied section 
of the ferry norrona which was carrying 297 people said a 
statement by the dublin irelandbased b and i shipping line 
company officials blamed arson 
captain hugo larsen was on the bridge of the 10500ton ferry as 
the smoldering ship was towed into harbor at dusk on saturday fire 
officials said he left the ship before all survivors were 
evacuated and returned later 
i never failed the passengers larsen was quoted as saying 
by swedens national tt news agency it was only when the flames 
were around the bridge and we didnt have a chance to go down to 
look for more passengers on the deck that i gave the order to leave 
the ship larsen was quoted as saying 
fire inspector ingvar brynfors who was among the first rescuers 
to reach the ship said larsen had moved to the stena saga another 
ferry that picked up survivors and helped coordinate rescue efforts 
larsen speaking on swedish radio also denied that the alarm 
failed to go off the fire alarm sounded all over the boat he 
said 
passengers complained that the crewmen mostly filipinos and 
portuguese sailors were untrained for emergencies and could not 
communicate with them 
rick qualls an american member of a songanddance troupe that 
worked on the ship said the alarm was sounded 15 minutes after the 
vessel caught fire and filled with smoke 
in a week aboard the ship he said he had never undergone a 
fire drill though he praised the crew for trying to save lives 
firefighter bjorn ralbring told the dagens nyheter newspaper 
that he was given to understand that everyone was safely evacuated 
by the time he arrived 3 hours after the distress signal was 
sent he said he was surprised to stumble over bodies 
behind every cabin door there were more dead people there 
were mothers who tried to protect their children with rags older 
couples were huddled together he said 
onso said sunday that the hunt for the cause of the fire would 
begin in earnest as soon as all the bodies were taken out and the 
ship cooled enough for investigators to work 
one unconfirmed report carried by several newspapers said larsen 
was warned of possible arson 10 hours before the voyage 
police confirmed that at least two fires broke out independently 
on separate decks within a few minutes of each other onso declined 
to speculate on how that fit with claims by the shipd danish 
owner vr dano that the fires were deliberately set 
on sept 25 1989 a fire started in a linen closet killed two 
peple on the tor scandinavia west of the danish coast police 
suspected arson but failed to charge anyone 
arson was not suspected in the other fires aboard the king of 
scandinavia feb 18 1989 in which five people were hospitalized 
and on the stena nordica 10 days later in which no one was injured

although the hungarian socialists were unique among the late

without massive popular pressure they were voted out of power in 
the first round many people associated the party with the excesses 
of 43 years of communist rule 
the communists consolidated power in 1948 a year after 
hungarys last multiparty elections which were widely believed to 
have been rigged 
in sundays runoffs 171 seats were directly elected and 90

intimate is not an adjective usually used in 
describing the musicals of andrew lloyd webber the man behind 
cats evita starlight express and the phantom of the 
opera 
but aspects of love which opened sunday at broadways 
broadhurst theater is a small lloyd webber musical that attempts 
to spin several personal paperthin stories into a rueful 
meditation on the wayward ways of love 
despite designer maria bjornsons stunning settings including 
one breathtaking mountain panorama aspects of love is really a 
chamber piece a showcase for what is lloyd webbers most unified 
and complex work to date 
the musical wont be the audience pleaser that his past megahits 
have been the tone is a little too rarified and several of its 
leading characters are decidedly unlikable but the show represents 
an important step forward for the composer in terms of musical 
construction 
aspects of love is based on a short snobby and 
sophisticated novel by david garnett a minor member of the 
bloomsbury group in the book garnett chronicled the couplings 
and uncouplings of various arty types in the south of france 
lloyd webber has updated the book a bit setting his story 
between the years 1947 and 1964 the protagonist is alex 
dillingham whose obsession with an older actress rose vibert 
lasts those 17 years his fascination with her transcends roses 
marriage to his uncle george her flirtation with an italian 
sculptress named giulietta and even his infatuation with his niece 
jenny the daughter of rose and george got that 
there is enough bedhopping and sexual longing to satisfy the 
most ardent soap opera fan but the lloyd webber music elevates the 
story to something more and trevor nunns fluid direction makes 
sure the show doesnt linger too long on the more precious 
permutations of garnetts plot 
musically the show which is sung through with almost no spoken 
dialogue mirrors the various aspects of love there are soaring 
melodies of budding romance like love changes everything and 
seeing is believing wistful melancholy remembrances like 
other pleasures and the first man you remember 
falling a quartet that neatly and quickly reveals the leading 
characters emotional states and even an impassioned terrifying 
plea for companionship anything but lonely 
the lyrics for aspects of love like those written for the 
phantom of the opera are not as strong as the music 
colyricists don black and charles hart have done a workmanlike 
job but they strike fire only once in a while 
still there are some ravishing moments in the show when 
everything comes together the best occurs in the second act when 
george fox trots with his daughter jenny to the haunting the 
first man you remember its an achingly beautiful scene a 
perfect blending of lloyd webber romanticism the simplicity of the 
lyrics by black and hart and nunns cinematic direction 
the four leads are distinctive able actors and fine singers 
too particularly adept is the boyish michael ball whose booming 
tenor voice is just right for the overly eager alex who turns into 
a disillusioned middleaged man before the curtain falls 
ann crumb gives a perfect predatory performance as the 
calculating rose and kathleen rowe mcallen is a sexy wanton 
giulietta best of all is kevin colson as the worldweary 
pragmatic george a man content with just a memory of a happy 
moment and whose motto is life goes on love goes free 
there also is fine support from walter charles as marcel roses 
loyal stage manager and danielle duclos as the vulnerable jenny 
but in the end the real star is lloyd webber and his melodies are 
as seductive as ever

what other critics said 
frank rich the new york times mr lloyd webber continues to 
compose in the official style that has made him an international 
favorite sacrificing any personality of his own to the 
merchandisable common denominator of easylistening pop music 
though aspects of love purports to deal with romance in many 
naughty guises it generates about as much heated passion as a 
visit to the bank 
howard kissel the daily news it never really explores the 
complex material it is rather a relentless heartless attempt to 
create another hit 
clive barnes new york post the really fascinating aspect of 
the new andrew lloyd webber musical aspects of love is what 
a truly engrossing piece of music theater it all is a 
breakthrough piece for lloyd webber this is a great night for

forecasters say the weather probably 
will cooperate when the space shuttle discovery takes off with 
nasas most valuable and eagerly awaited payload the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope 
this project has been difficult there are at least three 
times when i thought we wouldnt do it said charles pellerin 
jr nasas director of astrophysics but were there and it all 
works and its going to be great 
the launch is scheduled for 847 am edt on tuesday 
pellerin inspected the telescope before the payload bay doors 
were closed sunday he was pleased to note there was no evidence of 
midges tiny mosquitolike insects that had invaded a payload 
preparation room at the launch pad two weeks ago 
i can tell you there are no mosquitos visible no midges no 
anything were extremely clean he said were ready to go 
later in the day however a short was detected in a heater 
cable in a strut that connects the shuttle to its huge fuel tank 
the heater prevents ice from forming on the strut when the tank is 
filled with supercold liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen 
shuttle program director robert l crippen said the problem was 
not expected to delay the mission which already is seven years 
late because of technical problems and the 1986 challenger 
explosion 
its not a concern we dont need it and were going to go 
ahead and fly with it like it is nasa test director al sofge 
said today 
discoverys commander air force col loren j shriver and its 
pilot marine col charles f bolden jr practiced emergency 
landings at the kennedy space center on sunday they flew the 
shuttletraining aircraft again today and were expected to review 
their flight plans 
air force weather forecasters were giving 50 percent odds for 
favorable weather early tuesday morning with the main threat being 
a low cloud ceiling caused by a warm front moving in from the 
south the odds were expected to improve later in the morning to 80 
percent the outlook worsened considerably if liftoff were delayed 
a day 
nasa may delay putting the astronauts inside the shuttle if it 
appears the weather will prevent a prompt launch sofge said the 
space agency does not want the crew inside for more than 2 hours 
after the launch window opens at 847 am to prevent fatigue 
nasa can wait as long as about six hours until midafternoon to 
launch discovery 
we start counting and if we have to sit and wait well sit 
and wait before loading the astronauts sofge said 
discovery is to climb to an altitude of 380 miles the highest a 
shuttle has ever gone in order to put the telescope into its 
proper orbit 
mission specialist steven a hawley will put the 24250pound 
telescope into open space with the shuttles 50footlong 
mechanical arm on the second day of the fiveday flight 
veteran spacewalkers bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan 
will be standing by to step out of the shuttle cabin if a problem 
develops 
discovery will trail the hubble from 46 miles away for nearly 
two days until the telescopes eightfoot mirror is exposed to 
space 
the telescope named after the late astronomer edwin p hubble 
will be capable during its 15 years in orbit of detecting objects 
50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best 
groundbased observatory 
astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their 
light has been traveling to earth for 14 billion years the 
universe is believed to have been formed about 15 billion years ago 
by a tremendous explosion known as the big bang 
john bahcall president of the american astronomical society 
said the hubble will provide at least partial answers to 
fundamental questions about the universe 
but he said he will be disappointed if all we do is answer 
these questions 
the most important discoveries will provide answers to 
questions that we do not yet know how to ask he said

ryan white the boy next door who put a 
youthful face on aids and fought discrimination against its 
victims was mourned today by classmates who honored his 5year 
struggle with the disease 
white 18 died shortly after 7 am sunday of lung congestion 
from an aidsrelated respiratory infection he had been in critical 
condition on a ventilator at riley hospital for children since 
march 29 
we will have a moment of silence and try to have school as 
normal as possible today principal steve dillon told the 550 
students of hamilton heights high school in arcadia at an 8 am 
assembly today 
whites death saddened many who had followed his battle with the 
illness since 1985 when he made national headliines after being 
barred from a public school system because of fears of the disease 
i think one of the things we can all learn from ryan is to be 
courageous not to give up and fight as hard as you can for what 
you want dillon said 
dillon said students who wanted to attend whites funeral 
wednesday would be given time off from class the schools four 
counselors would be available to students who were encouraged to 
discuss whites death with their teachers 
students arriving at the school passed by dozens of reporters 
and camera crews from news organizations around the country no 
reporters were allowed on school grounds sheriffs deputies 
provided extra security 
white was recalled as a young man who made a difference 
he was the boy next door who first showed a stunned nation 
that no one is safe from the risk of aids said dr martin b 
kleiman whites physician throughout his illness he had no 
bitterness 
with an honest simplicity his was the voice that many if not 
most first heard even though his was not the first voice 
at the end his family and a few of the others who loved him 
were close at his side said kleiman he never regained 
consciousness and i am confident that he suffered no pain at the 
end 
his mother jeanne and his 16yearold sister andrea had kept 
a bedside vigil joined at times singer elton john and the rev 
jesse jackson singer michael jackson arrived in indiana sunday to 
offer condolences to the family 
his schoolmates at hamilton heights were shocked sunday to learn 
of whites death 
i hoped they could find a cure before it was over said 
freshman aaron gilmore 15 he was aware of what could happen 
but i remember him saying that hes going to live for five years 
until they find a cure and if they didnt hed live for five 
more and keep going until they find a cure 
john who stayed at the hospital with the whites nearly a week 
dedicated the song candle in the wind to white during the farm 
aid iv concert saturday night at the hoosier dome about a mile 
from the hospital 
this ones for ryan john said to the cheers of 45000 fans 
at the concert to raise funds for financially troubled farmers 
president bush who last week planted a tree in whites honor in 
downtown indianapolis said he and first lady barbara were deeply 
saddened by whites death 
ryans death reaffirms that we as a people must pledge to 
continue the fight his fight against this dreaded disease bush 
said 
white born dec 16 1971 in kokomo was 13 when he was 
diagnosed with aids in december 1984 he had contracted acquired 
immune deficiency syndrome through a bloodclotting agent used to 
treat his hemophilia 
in 1985 white was barred from western middle school near kokomo 
after school officials and parents rejected health authorities 
assurances that aids cannot be spread through casual contact 
after months of school board battles and court hearings white 
won the right to attend school but pressures on his family later 
drove the whites to the town of cicero and he enrolled at hamilton 
heights high school in nearby arcadia 
in his new home townspeople and fellow students rallied around 
him and befriended him 
white became a national spokesman for children with aids 
appearing at congressional hearings and fundraisers and the story 
of his life was told in a 1989 madefortv movie 
in 1988 white spoke before the national education association 
and discussed his battle with aids 
i stand before you to ask for your help white told the 
teachers the many people against me said they werent against 
me but against my disease help me beat the odds and together 
lets educate and save the children of the world by proper 
education aids can be a disease not a dirty word 
dr woodrow a myers jr health commissioner of indiana during 
whites legal struggle said white was chosen to lead the nation 
out of ignorance and hatred of people with aids 
this young man made a difference that may never again be 
achieved myers said through his actions and his eyes he 
taught us about ourselves only time will tell how well the lessons 
were learned 
whites last public appearance was march 26 at an oscar party 
for ill children in los angeles with former president reagan and 
his wife nancy 
gov evan bayh who ordered flags at the statehouse flown at 
halfstaff wednesday in whites honor called the youth an 
american hero in a letter to mrs white 
aids brought him to public attention but his courage made him 
special we can hope and pray that his family finds peace and 
consolation in the fact that had the world not known ryan white 
our understanding treatment and concern for people with aids would 
be harsher and more judgmental 
funeral services were scheduled for wednesday but arrangements 
were incomplete

if we all strike on the 10th of april we will win out against

weary negotiators today agreed on a cabinet 
list for a coalition to replace the caretaker communist government 
but divisions remained over plans for unification with west germany 
and conversion to capitalism 
lothar de maiziere the christian democrat leader named to form 
a government said a firstrate climate prevailed in todays 
talks after a grueling fivehour session the previous night 
the leadership of each party still must give a green light to 
the proposed list already agreed upon by the negotiators de 
maiziere told reporters adding he hopes to have the cabinet ready 
to present to parliament on thursday 
officials did not say who was on the proposed cabinet list 
leaders of the social democratic party which won the 
secondlargest number of votes in the countrys first free election 
march 18 expressed satisfaction on the course of todays talks but 
said differences still had to be discussed 
guenther krug spokesman for the social democrats said there 
were substantial differences with the conservative alliance led 
by the christian democrats that will be the dominant force in the 
new government 
we assume that difficult negotiations lie ahead krug said 
among the issues which still must be clarified are germanys 
relationship to nato after unification internal security and the 
thorny issue of private property 
the leftleaning social democrats favor a more gradual form of 
unification than the conservative christian democrats east germany 
faces a tough road ahead in converting to capitalism after more 
than 40 years of communist rule 
lothar de maiziere leads a threeparty alliance that holds the 
most seats in the 400member parliament and closely follows the 
policies of west german chancellor helmut kohl head of his 
countrys christian democrats 
de maiziers alliance lacks the twothirds majority that is 
needed to enact constitutional changes to allow unification with 
west germany 
a coalition with the social democrats would give de maiziere 
control but if negotiations with that party fail he can try to 
build coalitions with other political parties 
the social democrats are calling for employee participation in 
the ownership of former stateowned companies while the christian 
democrats favor complete privatization 
the social democrats who finished second in the elections also 
were demanding that the christian democrats use their close 
connections with kohl to obtain a copy of west germanys proposed 
blueprint for reunification 
the treaty being discussed in bonn would set out the laws that 
would be applied in a unified germany in effect outlining the 
terms for combining their social and economic structures 
the social democrats have said that they will press to preserve 
at least some of east germanys extensive social welfare system if 
they participate in the government

crowds lined up again today to see photographs 
by the late robert mapplethorpe that have resulted in obscenity 
indictments against an art center 
the 175photograph exhibit includes seven pictures deemed 
objectionable saturday by a hamilton county grand jury which 
indicted the contemporary arts center and its director dennis 
barrie 
us district judge carl rubin issued an emergency protective 
order on sunday that allows the show to remain open and unchanged 
about 100 people waited in line today to get into the museum 
i think we have a right to see it roshani soyza a 
university of cincinnati law student said outside the museum 
the artist has a great reputation 
after the museum opened at 10 am security guards let people 
in 10 at a time they said they wanted to avoid crowding 
the indictment sparked public interest in the show sunday when 
the center opened an hour early to accommodate a large crowd 
were here as a show of support said michael moore 
accompanied by his wife diane i thought the indictment was 
absurd and ridiculous it lends a backward light to the city of 
cincinnati 
arts center employees estimated that about 10000 people saw the 
exhibit over the weekend including a private showing for members 
on friday night that made it the biggest opening ever for the 
downtown center 
county prosecutor arthur ney on saturday did not rule out the 
possibiliity of seizing the photos if the center didnt remove 
seven photographs which depict homosexual acts or children with 
their genitals exposed 
but the judge granted the art center a protective order during 
an unusual sunday morning hearing rubin said he was concerned that 
the legal questions can be rendered moot if the exhibit is 
closed or partially seized 
you may not recover any photos you may not close the exhibit 
to the public you may not take any action that could be 
intimidating in nature to prevent the public from seeing the 
exhibit rubin told lawyers for the county and city 
the center hailed the protective order 
thats all we wanted just to stop the continued threats 
said the centers lawyer h louis sirkin 
james w harper chief assistant prosecuting attorney for civil 
cases also was upbeat about the ruling 
it isnt our intention to seize the pictures he said 
the president of citizens for community values a leader in 
organizing opposition to the exhibit had little comment on rubins 
ruling 
its time to let the legal system run its course monty lobb 
jr said the next step is barries arraignment friday at which he 
is expected to plead innocent to charges of pandering obscenity and 
illegal use of a minor in pornographic material 
the two counts carry a maximum penalty of a year in jail and 
fines of up to 2000 the center was indicted on identical 
charges carrying a maximum penalty of a 10000 fine 
the question of whether the seven photos are obscene will be 
left to an eightmember jury a trial date is expected to be set 
friday 
the exhibit is scheduled to run through may 26 and move to 
boston in august 
some of those who saw the exhibit over the weekend said they saw 
nothing obscene 
i saw the show i dont think its obscene theres some rough 
stuff i wouldnt want kids to see but that doesnt mean adults 
shouldnt see it councilman guy guckenberger said 
the arts center is not admitting people under 18 and has put up 
a warning sign at the door 
the university of pennsylvanias institute of contemporary art 
organized the exhibit in the fall of 1988 it drew crowds in 
philadelphia in december 1988 and in chicago at the time of 
mapplethorpes march 1989 death from acquired immune deficiency 
yndrome mapplethorpe 42 lived in new york city 
last june the corcoran gallery of art in washington dc 
canceled the exhibit the washington exhibit prompted congress to 
limit funds for the arts after sen jesse helms rnc declared 
the photographs obscene

the conservative new democrats declared 
victory today after greeces third parliamentary election in 10 
months and party leader constantine mitsotakis said he will form a 
government this week 
election officials said mitsotakis new democracy party had won 
150 of parliaments 300 seats in sundays election just one seat 
short of the majority needed to govern alone 
new democracy had fallen just short of a majority in 
inconclusive june and november elections 
mitsotakis met today with costis stephanopoulos the leader of 
the small democratic renewal party which won one seat in an effort 
to gain the support needed to form greeces first rightwing 
government in nine years 
after a 30minute meeting stephanopoulos announced that his 
conservative group would support new democracy in order to give it 
the necessary 151seat parliamentary majority stephanopoulos a 
former member of new democracy broke away from the party four 
years ago following a dispute with mitsotakis 
before meeting with stephanopoulos mitsotakis had expressed 
confidence at an early morning postelection news conference that 
he could form a government 
in todays elections the greek people decided the 
71yearold mitsotakis said they gave the victory to new 
democracy in my view with 150 seats we can form a government and 
we will win the approval of parliament 
stephanopoulos support will end a 10months political impasse 
that has left greece unable to cope with a crumbling economy and 
growing urban terrorism 
under the constitution mitsotakis must first get the nod to 
form a government from president christos sartzetakis 
party officials said mitsotakis would meet with sartzetakis on 
tuesday and announce the members of his cabinet the following day 
a new democracy spokesman said mitsotakis would seek a vote of 
confidence when parliament officially convenes april 23 
the official returns showed new democracy with 4689 percent of 
the vote up slightly from the partys 4619 percent showing in 
novembers inconclusive election 
the leftofcenter panhellenic socialist movement pasok had 
3862 percent of the vote and 123 parliamentary seats while a 
communistled alliance of leftist parties had 1028 percent and 19 
seats small parties and independents took the remaining eight 
seats with a combined 321 percent of the vote 
the socialists and communists blocked from forming a coalition 
of their own remained united in their opposition to the 
conservatives plans to turn the ailing economy around 
we will defend the vested interests of the greek people 
said pasok leader and former premier andreas papandreou who did 
not concede defeat early today pasok will wage its battle both 
inside and outside of parliament 
new democracy has taken a tough line on tackling the countrys 
economic problems which include an estimated 156 billion budget 
deficit and an inflation rate of about 17 percent the 
conservatives have pledged to liberalize the economy slash public 
spending cut the countrys unwieldy public sector and attract 
foreign investment 
pasok supports state intervention in the economy the party 
wants to step up productivity in the public sector but not cut 
public spending 
the brief conservativecommunist coalition government formed 
after the june election and the allparty coalition forged after 
the november polls both postponed key decisions on the economy 
if mitsotakis can form a government it will mark the 
conservatives return to power after losing in a landslide to 
papandreous pasok in 1981 
new democracy and the communists indicted papandreou and several 
members of his eightyear administration in september on charges of 
corruption no trial date has been set however 
a new democracy victory could mean greece will make 
longpostponed decisions on a us extradition request for a 
palestinian wanted for the 1982 bombing of an airliner over hawaii 
and on a new military bases agreement with the united states 
mitsotakis has said that he considers the four us military 
bases crucial for the defense of greece he has also said that he 
would extradite mohammed rashid the palestinian wanted by the 
united states

a woman is challenging a judges ruling 
that she cannot change her surname without her husbands permission 
lucille anne riccitelli has filed an appeal of a probate judges 
decision in superior court saying she would like to use her maiden 
name because there are no more men to carry it on according to 
court papers 
the american civil liberties unions rhode island affiliate said 
today it would back riccitelli in her fight she already is using 
her maiden name of riccitelli instead of her married name of 
martin on all legal documents except one bank account 
on march 8 providence probate judge anthony b sciarretta asked 
riccitelli her marital status and upon learning that she was 
married and would not obtain her husbands written consent denied 
her petition riccitellis lawyer a gregory frazier said in 
court papers filed friday 
riccitellis husband edward martin said he supports his wifes 
efforts however frazier said riccitelli 41 doesnt feel she 
has any obligation to get her husbands permission 
in 1979 the state supreme court ruled that anyone can change 
his or her name without court approval as long as the name is used 
consistently and is not used to evade creditors or law enforcement 
officials frazier said 
frazier said cases such as riccitellis are not unique he 
added however that because of the way the citys probate court 
system is set up many who are denied name changes are unable to 
appeal 
because court fees are not assessed in those cases where the 
request is denied there is no record of the case only those who 
are given approval to change their names are assessed a court fee 
riccitelli however insisted on paying the fee even though her 
request was denied in order for the case to go on record this 
enabled her to document the case and appeal to a higher court 
frazier said

the palestinian terrorist group led by 
abu nidal said today it will free three european hostages it holds 
by the end of this month 
but the fatahrevolutionary council linked the freedom of four 
other european hostages all belgians to the release of a 
palestinian serving a life sentence in belgium for a grenade attack 
on jewish youths 
walid khaled spokesman for fatahrevolutionary council said 
three hostages will be released by the end of the current islamic 
holy month of ramadan the month is expected to end around april 
26 depending on when the new moon is sighted 
he listed the three as french hostage jacqueline valente 32 
her belgian boyfriend ferdinand houtekins in his 40s and their 
2yearold daughter sophie who was born in captivity 
the couple were hostages since november 1987 when their yacht 
was seized in the mediterranean sea off the coast of the 
israelioccupied gaza strip 
last week libyan leader moammar gadhafi called for the release 
of ms valente as a compassionate measure to mark the ramadan holy 
month of ramadan 
khaled would not comment on freedom for a second valente 
daughter believed to have been born in captivity after sophie 
ms valente will talk about that when she is released he 
said 
the other belgians being held by abu nidals group are emmanuel 
houtekins in his 40s his wife godelieve kets age unavailable 
his son laurent and daughter valerie both teenagers they were 
also seized on the yacht 
referring to the four belgian hostages khaled brought up the 
case of nasser saeed a palestinian who received a life sentence 
for a june 27 1980 attack against jewish youths in antwerp that 
killed a 15yearold and injured 20 other people 
freeing nasser saeed is a basic demand for the resumption of 
negotiations related to the release of the four belgians khaled 
said speaking to reporters at his office in beiruts mar elias 
palestinian refugee camp he refused to elaborate 
the belgian daily de morgen published an interview today with 
saeed who is being held at leuven prison 
it is my release which is being demanded by the 
hostagetakers the paper quoted saeed as saying they made 
that clear my release can only be a political decision 
under belgian law saeed can ask for early release later this 
year 
on sunday abu nidals group said that plans to free ms 
valente ferdinand houtekins and the child were proceeding 
according to plan 
but it criticized belgian justice minister melchior wathelet for 
reneging in public statements on commitments made during 
unannounced negotiations 
wathelet said last week that he had made no promises to obtain 
the release of the hostages 
abu nidals group announced on nov 8 1987 that it had seized 
a group of hostages from the french yacht silco off the gaza strip 
and accused them of collaborating with israels mossad intelligence 
agency friends said the group was on a holiday cruise 
because the boat hostages are believed to be in libya they are 
not listed among the 18 western hostages missing in lebanon most 
of them are held by proiranian shiite moslem factions the 
longestheld is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
abu nidal whose real name is sabri albanna split with yasser 
arafats palestine liberation organization in the 1970s and formed 
the fatahrevolutionary council 
the group has been blamed for scores of terrorist attacks 
including the december 1985 attacks on the rome and vienna airports 
that killed more than 20 people

the convoluted murder trial of a former 
policeman charged with the shotgun slaying of a neighbor ended 
today with his conviction for firstdegree murder and conspiracy to 
commit murder 
robert mclaughlin 49 had been a hampton police officer for 18 
years when he admitted killing robert cushing with two shotgun 
blasts on the evening of june 1 1988 his lawyers argued that 
mclaughlin was insane 
mclaughlins exwife susan cook already has been found guilty 
of conspiracy to commit firstdegree murder cook who divorced 
mclaughlin after her conviction is appealing her sentence to life 
in prison 
the rockingham county superior court jury returned the verdict 
after 3 days of deliberations mclaughlin stood expressionless as 
the jury announced its verdict and the individual jurors were 
polled 
the conviction carries a sentence of life in prison without 
parole defense lawyer michael iacopino said the verdict will be 
appealed to the state supreme court no date was set for sentencing 
in the courtroom audience cushings family wept as the rulings 
were announced cushings son robert jr said the family members 
are glad that mclaughlin had been convicted but now hope to put 
the tragedy behind them 
cushing 63 a former schoolteacher and successful real estate 
agent was cut down when he opened the door of his hampton home 
shocked neighbors and police were baffled until mclaughlin turned 
himself two months later 
his wife was convicted first however and during his pretrial 
hearings mclaughlin testified that she had killed cushing his 
lawyers produced letters cook wrote to mclaughlin from prison in 
which she admitted killing the neighbor 
then without explanation mclaughlins lawyers quit the case 
it was delayed until new counsel could be found cook obtained a 
divorce earlier this year 
in closing arguments prosecutor barbara keshen contrasted a 
desperately unhappy mclaughlin with a contented successful 
cushing the two had feuded for 13 years and keshen said the 
murder was the wellplanned action of an angry bitter man 
iacopino said in his closing statement that mclaughlin conceived 
the murder plan under a veil of alcohol and a large dose of a 
prescription drug xanax he said mclaughlin was under his wifes 
influence when he killed cushing 
robert mclaughlin jr testified against his father and cook 38 
at their trials they both get what they deserve he said 
today they took someones life away and for that they deserve to 
pay with their own lives

mci communications corp and telecom usa inc 
today announced they have agreed to merge in a 125 billion 
transaction 
under terms of the deal which has been approved by the boards 
of directors of both companies mci will acquire all outstanding 
shares of telecom usas common stock for 42 a share 
telecom usa stock jumped 1587 higher to 3775 a share in 
heavy midday trading on the new york stock exchange mci was down 
87 cents at 36 a share 
the transaction is subject to approval by telecoms stockholders 
the prospect of merging two dynamic highgrowth companies 
with similar cultures is very exciting said bert c roberts jr 
mcis president and chief operating officer combining their 
strengths will benefit shareholders customers and employees 
alike 
the proposed acquisition continues a pattern by mci which has 
increased its market share in part by buying smaller longdistance 
phone companies in the last few years it has bought satellite 
business systems western union international and rca global 
communications 
mci which is headquartered in washington is the nations 
secondlargest long distance phone company after american telephone 
amp telegraph co telecom based in atlanta is the fourthlargest 
telecom primarily serves customers in the southeast and midwest 
mcis 1989 revenues totaled 65 billion while telecom had 713 
million in sales last year 
atampt spokesman herb linnen said the announcement showed how 
hotly competitive the industry is atampt the dominant long 
distance carrier is asking the federal communications commission 
to loosen some regulatory ties on atampt that other companies do not 
face 
this development today is further evidence of the need for 
that said linnen it suggests two vigorous companies are 
combining forces to provide even more competition we wake up 
every day to a real knockdown dragout fight in the marketplace 
atampt holds about 64 percent of the long distance market down 
from about 90 percent before the courtordered breakup of the old 
bell system in 1984 and had 195 billion in revenues last year 
said linnen fcc figures showed mci with about 12 percent of the 
market and sprint with 9 percent 
roberts said both companies have played a major role in 
advancing technology developing innovative services and meeting 
customer requirements 
he added we look forward to having telecom usa management and 
employees assume roles in the new structure and welcome the 
opportunity to serve its customers 
o gene gabbard telecoms chairman and chief executive officer 
said mci recognizes his companys creative approach to product 
development and marketing 
both companies stand to gain by teaming employees facilities 
and services and as a unified force working to further enhance 
the ability to provide the highest value services in this rapidly 
growing and demanding industry gabbard said 
the merger is subject to government approval under the 
hartscottrodino act it is expected to be concluded as quickly as 
possible the companies said in a joint news release 
the complete terms of the merger will be included in a proxy 
statement to be mailed to telecom shareholders

cambodian resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk on monday urged an immediate ceasefire in his 
country and said the un security council should deploy 
peacekeeping troops to enforce it 
the proposed peacekeeping force would comprise american chinese 
and soviet soldiers 
sihanouk is head of a threefaction guerrilla alliance fighting 
the vietnameseinstalled government in cambodia he said there was 
a moral responsibility to find a solution to end the 11yearold 
war 
sihanouk said no winners will emerge from the conflict but that 
the big losers will be the small citizenry of cambodia 
in a statement issued from the village in northwestern cambodia 
where he lives sihanouk said the fivemember un security council 
should send a peacekeeping force and along with the warring 
factions proclaim an immediate ceasefire 
the peacekeeping force should wear the blue helmet of the 
united nations he said 
the five security council members are britain china france 
the soviet union and the united states 
sihanouk said the administrative power of the two warring groups 
in cambodia should be transferred to a un administrative 
authority which would work alongside a supreme national council 
symbolizing national sovereignty 
the council would be made up of six guerrilla members and six 
from the existing government he said 
sihanouk was head of state in cambodia until his government was 
ousted in a 1970 coup the government that replaced his was in turn 
ousted by the communist khmer rouge in 1975

the high court on monday rejected a bid by a 
moslem group to prosecute author salman rushdie and publishers 
viking penguin for blasphemy in connection with rushdies novel 
the satanic verses 
a panel of three judges upheld a lower court decision not to 
issue summonses against rushdie and his publishers it said chief 
metropolitan magistrate sir david hopkin ruled correctly last year 
that britains blasphemy laws apply only to the christian religion 
many moslems believe rushdies novel blasphemes islam the 
writer has been in hiding since feb 14 1989 when irans late 
spiritual leader the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called on 
moslems to execute him and those closely connected with the books 
publication 
during a fourday hearing the british moslem action front 
argued blasphemy laws should be extended to protect other 
religions including islam 
one of the fronts lawyers mohammed akhtar said its a sad 
day for race relations in this country and for the reputation of 
british justice but we have succeeded in exposing the inadequate 
and the discriminatory nature of the british laws 
the common law doctrine of blasphemy was laid down in 1675 by 
chief justice sir matthew hale he referred specifically to the 
christian religion but that was before britain had large immigrant 
communities of other religions 
the last successful prosecution for blasphemous libel in britain 
was in 1979 over a poem depicting jesus christ as a homosexual 
rushdie issued a statement through his lawyer saying he was 
grateful for the courts ruling he called for changes to britains 
blasphemy laws 
i regret that our blasphemy law discriminates between 
religions as well as discriminating against humanists and 
nonbelievers he said 
i join with many persons of good will in urging parliament to 
take the earliest opportunity to end this discrimination by 
abolishing an anachronistic crime which still notwithstanding 
todays decision carries dangers for freedom of expression 
rushdie was born into a moslem family in india 42 years ago he 
now is a british citizen and has left his faith 
he reiterated in his statement that even if the blasphemy law 
extended to islam my book cannot fairly be interpreted as a 
scurrilous or insulting attack on that faith

the leader of latvias supreme soviet said monday 
he is certain latvian legislators will vote to secede from the 
soviet union when they meet next month but that the independence 
process will be gradual 
anatolijs gorbunovs president of the supreme soviet or 
parliament said full separation is to be achieved in 
negotiations and discussions 
he spoke at a news conference two days after a communist party 
congress in latvia rejected a proposal to establish a communist 
party independent of the central soviet party about 300 of the 700 
delegates at the congress walked out to protest the vote 
gorbunovs said the party split made clear the support for 
independence in latvia there is no doubt the required 
twothirds majority will be achieved when parliament meets in may 
and considers independence he said 
gorbunovs said this would have to be followed by a complicated 
process to resolve all problems related to sovietlatvian 
relations in the interest of both sides 
gorbunovs a member of the breakaway communist party said he 
met with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev last month and that 
gorbachev told him he should submit his independence proposals in 
writing 
he said he did so in a letter sent to gorbachev but he refused 
to disclose details of his plan 
gorbunovs and other proindependence latvian lawmakers were in 
switzerland for a symposium this week marking the 125th birthday of 
latvian writer janis rainis rainis lived in exile in switzerland 
until 1920 
latvia was one of the three baltic republics forcibly annexed by 
the kremlin in 1940 the others are lithuania and estonia 
lithuania declared itself independent march 11 leading to a 
standoff with the kremlin that is still going on estonia also has 
a strong proindependence movement 
edvins inkens a senior member of the proindependent latvian 
popular front said he met last month with lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis landsbergis had one major request that 
latvia declare independence as quickly as possible because a united 
front of three republics is no longer just a regional problem 
inkens said 
gorbunovs said the three republics follow a united path 
differences are only in tactics but the strategic goals are 
identical 
we would like to achieve that goal through negotiations and 
discussions he said practically our stance coincides with 
gorbachevs stance but whether gorbachev will consequently realize 
this stance is another question

former dissident a philosopy professor spent seven years in 
prison in the 1950s for opposing communism 
he returned to slovenia last year after more than 20 years of 
exile in west germany pucnik said he was satisfied with the 
success in the first round of the elections because he was 
until recently virtually unknown in the republic 
political analysts predict a close contest in the runoff pucnik 
wants slovenia to secede from yugoslavia but kucan advocates a 
more cautious approach 
initial results suggest the slovenian communist party which 
recently changed its name to the party of democratic renewal will 
become the largest single party in the republics legislature but 
that demos a coalition of five conservative groups will have the 
most seats 
partial results indicated the renamed communists would have 
about 21 percent of the 240 seats and demos about 35 percent 
election officials said results of the legislative elections would 
not be complete until tuesday or wednesday 
support for secession has grown in slovenia the most liberal 
and prosperous of yugoslavias six republics because of the slow 
pace of political and economic reform elsewhere in the federation 
reformminded slovenian communists have created pluralistic 
politics in the past three years despite criticism from serbia the 
largest yugoslav republic serbian leaders favor continued 
dominance by the communist party 
kucan said he hoped the other republics including serbia would 
hold free elections in 1990 so people there can elect their 
legitimate leaderships 
croatia the secondlargest republic has elections scheduled 
later this month but no plans have been announced by the other 
four republics 
official serbian media virtually ignored the slovenian elections 
and said all slovenian parties and presidential candidates had the 
common goal of secession 
kramberger a restaurant owner and charity worker who needed 
6000 petition signatures to run as an independent said he was 
forming a new party whose members would be the poor sick and 
unprivileged 
those who want to join the party will first have to prove they 
are not communists he said

from curriculums and from overt racist attacks on campus

the educational institutions of this country only to realize that 
the education was flawed in and of itself

the bush administration conceded today that 
the savingsandloan bailout will cost taxpayers more than 
previously estimated 
theres no question that the cost is increasing and well have 
to take that into account in deciding future actions said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
his comments were in response to fridays report by the general 
accounting office an investigatory arm of congress that the 
10year cost of the program would be 243 billion instead of the 
166 billion estimated by the administration 
furthermore the gao said the 30year cost of the program could 
reach 325 billion 
we dont have an analysis either to endorse or reject the gao 
numbers except to say there clearly is going to be additional 
costs fitzwater said those numers will have to be decided 
upon at some point 
ftizwater rejected as total nonsense the contention by 
charles bowsher the gaos comptroller general that the 
administration had deliberately understated the cost of the bailout 
bowsher interviewed on nbcs meet the press said the bush 
administration had set an artifically low cost on the bailout so 
the government could appear to meet deficitreduction targets 
fitzwater said the resolution trust co set up to oversee the 
restructuring of the sampl industry had so far used about 10 
billion of the 50 billion it was provided under that original 
bailout legislation signed by bush last summer 
the best thing to do we believe is to work speedily with the 
funds and the progress we now have in place the spokesman said 
at this time there is not enough information to make a 
reliable estimate of how much more may be required many factors 
will determine if we need more funds including loss ratios 
interest rates asset sales et cetera fitzwater said 
asked if the net effect would be an increase in the federal 
deficit fitzwater said there is always that consequence if you 
have to increase amounts you have a responding impact on the 
deficit and budgetary considerations 
bowsher has said that the extra cost of the sampl bailout is so 
substantial that a tax increase will be needed 
economists have said for some time that the rescue plan would 
cost more than the administration estimated

ron haugens view of partisan politics is 
pretty flexible so he served as a delegate to both the republican 
and democratic state conventions over the weekend 
i didnt really know what party i liked so i thought id go to 
both conventions and see the 29year old northwood farmer said 
sunday from the floor of the democratic convention 
haugen was a bit embarrassed when reporters noticed him at both 
conventions is it illegal he asked i dont want any 
publicity 
he said he attended the democratic convention in legislative 
district 19 a republican stronghold 
in our district if you can crawl through the door youre a 
delegate he said of the democrats the district was allowed to 
send 23 delegates to the state convention but could muster only 
eight he noted 
he didnt attend the republicans district convention but was 
selected as a delegate to the state meeting anyway he said 
republican state rep dagne olsen of larimore said district 19 
republicans werent aware haugen also would be a delegate to the 
democrats convention

haugen said hell study the platforms of each party before 
deciding which he likes best 
but i dont know he added ill probably forget about

exxon announced today that it would 
plead innocent to a fivecount criminal indictment charging it with 
negligence and other crimes in the nations worst oil spill a year 
ago 
the grounding of the tanker exxon valdez was tragic but it 
was an accident the company said in a prepared statement 
announcing its intended plea 
exxon and its subsidiary exxon shipping co were scheduled for 
separate arraignments before a federal magistrate later in the day 
on feb 27 a federal grand jury handed up a fivecount criminal 
indictment against the company stemming from the oil spill which 
occurred after the exxon valdez slammed into a charted reef on 
march 24 1989 in prince william sound 
the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of north slope crude oil 
coated hundreds of miles of coastline and killed uncounted numbers 
of fish birds and other marine life 
exxon said it would vigorously defend itself against the 
charges which include violating clean water and refuse acts and 
negligently and unlawfully discharging oil into a navigable 
waterway 
we have said that from the beginning because nobody willfully 
grounded the ship or caused the spill we believe the conclusion is 
thoroughly supported by the testimony and the verdict in the trial 
of capt hazelwood the statement said 
capt joseph hazelwood the exxon valdez skipper was convicted 
last month on a single charge of negligently discharging oil but 
was acquitted on three other counts 
more than 160 civil suits are pending against exxon by the state 
of alaska environmentalists and private individuals

monday that syrian president hafez assad is making efforts to 
obtain the release of western hostages held in lebanon

three european hostages this month it also linked freedom for four 
belgians it holds to freedom for a palestinian terrorist jailed in 
belgium

assad in damascus for what the kansas republican called frank and 
contructive talks on the situation in lebanon the hostages and 
means of achieving peace in the middle east

release but he did not give details syria has good relations 
with iran which has influence with the hostageholders 
the senate delegation on a tour of the middle east is 
scheduled to meet tuesday with egyptian president hosni mubarak and 
foreign minister esmat abdelmeguid 
syria has repeatedly said it would like the 18 westerners held 
in lebanon to be freed and has assisted with hostage releases in 
the past many of the captives are believed held by proiranian 
shiite moslem groups 
the westerners missing in lebanon are eight americans four 
britons two west germans two swiss an irishman and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped in west 
beirut on march 16 1985

recovering the remains of lt col william r higgins an american 
serving with a un peacekeeping force who was kidnapped in south 
lebanon on feb 17 1988 
the shiite organization of the oppressed on earth claimed july 
31 1989 that it killed higgins in retaliation for israels 
kidnapping of a shiite leader sheik abdulkarim obeid in south 
lebanon three days earlier 
the group released a videotape showing a body on a gallows but 
us officials believe higgins was killed or died months earlier 
the other five senators are republican whip alan simpson of 
wyoming howard metzenbaum dohio and republicans jim mcclure of 
idaho charles grassley of iowa and frank murkowski of alaska 
after cairo the delegation is scheduled to visit israel and

hostages who were seized aboard a yacht in november 1987 their 
wherabouts is not known and they are not counted among the 
hostages held in lebanon

a telephone company is taking a 
technological leap backward in an effort to fight the drug problem 
u s west has replaced pushbutton pay phones with rotary models 
at about 18 twin cities locations to make it harder for drug 
dealers to conduct business with telephone pagers u s west 
spokesman mike breda said 
because most pagers dont work unless the call comes from a 
pushbutton phone drug dealers with pagers cant use the rotary 
phones 
pagers have become a way of life for dealers who often fear 
their telephone lines are tapped 
everybodys got them lt james singer of the st paul 
police narcotics unit said of the pagers 
customers order drugs by telephoning a dealers pager and then 
punching in a phone number or a prearranged code police say the 
dealer responds by calling back or showing up with the drugs 
in the past minneapolis and st paul police regularly asked the 
telephone company to remove pay phones in druginfested areas or to 
adjust the phones so they dont accept incoming calls but removing 
public phones can hurt people who cant afford private telephones 
we have noticed a decrease in traffic in at least a couple of 
locations where we changed the phones said minneapolis council 
member jackie cherryhomes i dont think it is going to win the 
battle against drugs but if you can affect it in any way thats 
important 
however u s wests tactic may not work for long at least one 
paging company now offers a pager in which the caller can use any 
phone 
at least one paging company has taken steps to try to halt the 
use of pagers for illegal purposes said steven miorana general 
manager of minncomm paging in minneapolis 
a typical drug dealer will receive more than 1000 pages per 
month he said minncomm now charges an extra 20 cents per call 
after 500 calls to discourage excessive use he said

labor party leader shimon peres predicted 
monday that the 28monthold palestinian uprising will wane once 
his party leads the government into a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
peres also predicted the soviet union would upgrade ties with 
israel and allow direct moscowtel aviv flights to spee up jewish 
emigration 
peres comments appeared in two hebrewlanguage newspapers as 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud bloc was 
making intensive lastditch efforts to block his road to power 
shamir was wooing defectors in advance of a wednesday 
parliamentary vote on peres confirmation 
peres told the al hamishmar daily that once his government is 
installed israel will approve proposals by secretary of state 
james a baker iii for an israelipalestinian meeting in cairo 
peres support for bakers ideas toppled the laborlikud 
coalition government march 15 when shamir lost a vote of 
confidence in the parliament he had refused to agree to the us 
proposals 
bakers plan was aimed at bridging differences between israel 
and the plo over an israeli proposal to hold elections in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip the 17 million palestinians 
would choose representatives to negotiate an interim agreement 
peres told the masscirculation yediot ahronot i estimate 
that the intefadeh uprising will wane and that millions of 
shekels in the state budget can be diverted to constructive tasks 
i can already foresee the fruits of opening peace 
negotiations he added relations will be renewed with the 
soviet union in a matter of weeks 
the kremlin broke ties with israel during the 1967 middle east 
war the two established lowlevel consular relations in 1987 
the uprising has resulted in the death of 673 palestinians from 
israeli gunfire and 43 israeli deaths as a result of arab violence 
in addition it has cost israel nearly 1 billion in added 
military costs and lost tourist revenue 
i want to solve the problem of the residents of these 
territories it is our main burden peres told al hamishmar 
the whole world is moving toward elections why not for the 
palestinians 
peres indicated he planned no change in israels policy of 
refusing to speak to the plo but he appeared to leave room for 
some indirect plo involvement in the negotiations 
there is a palestinian side for negotiations i dont 
understand why we should go beyond that peres told al hamishmar 
peres said he had no immediate plans to change israels 
electoral system despite a weekend rally at which more than 
100000 israelis demanded election laws to counter the wheeling and 
dealing that has characterized the governmentbuilding process 
i want to change the system but not now peres told yediot 
ahronot adding peace is no less important

the start of raymond buckeys second trial in 
the mcmartin preschool molestation case was abruptly postponed 
today after his lawyer called in sick 
attorney danny davis had complained earlier of back trouble and 
asked last week for the appointment of an assistant counsel to help 
in case he was incapacitated 
superior court judge stanley weisberg took no action on the 
matter then after davis failed to appear today weisberg met in 
chambers with prosecutors and an attorney who accompanied buckey to 
the courthouse 
buckey said the attorney john wagner was seeking appointment 
as davis cocounsel wagner previously represented buckeys 
sister peggy ann and is familiar with the mcmartin case 
jury selection had been scheduled to begin today in what 
promises to be another emotionally charged trial involving the 
31yearold buckey 
buckey and davis were among the few familiar faces in court 
today the prosecutors and judge in the first marathon trial have 
been replaced and one of the original defendants is missing peggy 
mcmartin buckey raymonds mother was acquitted of all charges 
jan 18 
buckey was acquitted of most of the molestation charges against 
him but district attorney ira reiner decided to retry eight counts 
on which the jury deadlocked 
critics have accused reiner of yielding to pressure from 
mcmartin parents and their supporters who carried on a loud 
campaign for a retrial reiner who is running for california 
attorney general has denied any political motivations 
the first trial of buckey and his mother lasted nearly three 
years and cost 13 million the longest costliest criminal trial 
in us history 
initially reiner planned to retry buckey on all 13 charges on 
which the jury could not reach a decision but last month he 
dismissed five counts considered difficult to prove 
the eight remaining charges involve three children dramatically 
fewer than the hundreds once described as alleged mcmartin 
molestation victims 
the case is nothing more than a rehash of a case that was 
slanted for acquittal before buckey said outside a pretrial 
hearing last week he called it a political maneuver and said 
it would be a mental physical and spiritual grind for him to 
go through another trial 
his lawyer davis said ive tried this case once before and 
it didnt stand i dont expect this to be any different 
the new chief prosecutor deputy district attorney joe martinez 
said he expects at least one thing to be different the trials 
length 
with far fewer charges and only one defendant martinez said he 
thinks the case could wrap up in six months 
it all depends on how well the judge controls the procedure 
he said suggesting that superior court judge stanley weisberg 
limit crossexamination by the defense to avoid the witnessstand 
marathons that marked the first case 
in the trial that ended in january buckey and his 63yearold 
mother had been accused of molesting 11 children at their manhattan 
beach preschool during a fiveyear period jurors acquitted them of 
52 molestation counts but deadlocked on the 13 charges against 
buckey 
that trial was the culmination of a case that began in 1983 
prosecutors alleged that buckey his mother sister grandmother 
and three other teachers molested hundreds of tots at the nursery 
school there were accounts of satanic rites and animals tortured 
to frighten the youngsters into silence 
but after an 18month preliminary hearing charges were dropped 
against five defendants after reiner concluded the evidence was 
weak 
when buckey and his mother came to trial in 1987 the 
prosecution case had been pruned from hundreds of counts of child 
molestation to 64 counts and a shared count of conspiracy the 41 
children once said to have been abused came down to 11 alleged 
victims 
it was a rancorous trial and when it ended superior court judge 
william pounders was barred from presiding at the retrial because 
of his comments on tv talk shows after the verdict deputy district 
attorneys lael rubin and roger gunson bowed out at their own 
request 
martinez and deputy district attorney pam ferrero replaced them 
weisberg stepped into pounders role

oscar oca carino who managed the philippine national banks 
new york branch from 1973 to 1984 said he was asked to accompany 
mrs marcos on the trip by her personal secretary fe roa jimenez 
who told him to bring the cash 
he said he closely guarded the money even keeping the bag 
between his feet on the airplane of course i never let it out 
of my sight 
thats why people in korea referred to me as the satchel 
man carino said during his third day on the witness stand at 
mrs marcos fraud trial 
he said mrs marcos gave 14000 in bundles of 1000 to the 
wives of filipino generals also attending parks funeral 
the prosecution alleges that mrs marcos the former philippine 
first lady used the pnb as her personal piggy bank in earlier 
testimony carino told of providing millions of dollars from the 
governmentowned bank to finance mrs marcos frequent visits to 
new york between 1973 and 1984 
the former bank manager also said he asked mrs marcos close 
friend gliceria tantoco why president ferdinand e marcos bought 
a manhattan office building in 1981 after first deciding against 
the purchase 
i asked mrs tantoco what happened that the decision not to go 
ahead was reversed was mrs marcos extra nice to the 
president 
carino said mrs tantoco replied she cried to him and told 
the president to give the building to her as an inheritance or 
gift 
the crown building on fifth avenue is one of four properties the 
government charges the marcoses purchased with more than 160 
million stolen from the philippine treasury 
mrs marcos lawyer gerald spence questioning carinos 
testimony about his conversation with mrs tantoco elicited that 
carino never confirmed mrs tantocos statements 
mrs marcos 60 pleaded innocent to charges of racketeering 
racketeering conspiracy mail fraud and obstruction of justice her 
husband also was charged in the 1988 indictment but died in exile 
in hawaii last september 
mrs tantoco the owner of rustans department store in the 
philippines and her husband bienvenido the former philippine 
ambassador to the vatican also were charged but are fugitives

helping the marcoses hide their ownership of the manhattan 
properties 
after monday the trial will recess until april 17 because of

colombian president virgilio barco told an 
international drug conference monday that drug barons are not 
invincible and he appealed to cocaine users to give up the habit 
that has created havoc in his country 
i should like to make an earnest plea to drug consumers to 
realize that their habit is bringing our countries to the brink of 
disaster that their addiction is fostering violence crime and 
corruption throughout the world barco said at the start of a 
threeday drug summit 
dr louis sullivan the us secretary of health said an 
international commitment to end the drug crisis would not only send 
drug kingpins a message that their days are numbered but also 
would send a message to users that they bear responsibility in 
perpetuating the drug problem 
we must communicate to users that help is available to them 
but that they must seek it he said 
up to 10 million cocaine users in the united states spend 
approximately 20 billion to 25 billion per year on cocaine 
roughly equivalent to the gross national products of colombia peru 
or bolivia according to a report produced by the panos institute 
it is a nonprofit international development organization 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told the 
conference that the world traffic in illicit drugs amounts to about 
500 billion a year ranking just behind the arms trade 
it is a sad commentary on the state of mankind at the end of 
the 20th century that the bulk of our vast productive energies is 
devoted to manufacturing our own destruction perez de cuellar 
said 
he added that conservative estimates put the number of illicit 
drug users at more than 40 million worldwide 
the meeting formally called the world ministerial drugs summit 
to reduce the demand for drugs and to combat the cocaine threat 
was called by british prime minister margaret thatcher it is being 
sponsored by britain and the united nations 
our efforts to reduce production of drugs and to prevent 
traffic in them can never succeed while demand for drugs is still 
there mrs thatcher told the more than 800 ministers and 
delegates from 112 nations 
she said britain would set up task forces to train customs 
agents and officials fighting drug trafficking and to assist 
developing countries with drug education she said britain would 
contribute 73 million more to help colombia battle its powerful 
cocaine cartels 
barco whose antidrug efforts have made him a target for south 
american drug barons arrived at londons queen elizabeth ii 
conference center under heavy security 
he said authorities now understand that to break the noose of 
drugs they must deal not only with the drug barons but with the 
peasants who produce coca leaves the large companies manufacturing 
processing chemicals the transporters those who conceal drugs in 
warehouses and the banks that launder drug money 
we are contending with an international criminal organization 
acknowledging no frontiers barco said 
but he added the fight in which colombia is engaged reveals 
that the drug barons are not invincible they are not untouchable 
the myth that the drug barons are stronger than the state or 
society is only that a myth 
colombia has extradited 15 drug suspects to the united states 
since its crackdown began in august and one of the medellin 
cartels leaders gonzalo rodriguez gacha was shot to death by 
drug agents in december 
italys interior minister antonio gava quoting figures provided 
by the international police agency interpol said cocaine seizures 
in europe had increased from 3300 pounds in 1986 to 13860 pounds 
in 1989

for the 20 minutes it took for the wildlife officials to arrive 
but when the trappers slipped a noose on the gator it turned 
ornery flipping boxes upending chairs and attacking a vacuum it 
clenched the appliances cord in its teeth 
mike fagan a wildlife official figures the 125pound gator 
wandered in a back door saturday from a nearby pond in search of 
food 
ive only been here a year and a half and the last thing i

nasa said there was only a 40 
percent chance that weather would delay tuesdays launch of the 
space shuttle discovery on its mission to place a telescope in 
orbit to look toward the edge of the universe 
launch of the 35th shuttle mission from kennedy space center was 
set for 847 am edt there was a chance that low clouds could 
push that time back 
once in orbit the hubble space telescope 43 feet long 14 feet 
in diameter and weighing 24250 pounds will be lifted out of 
discoverys cargo bay with the ships mechanical arm given an 
exacting checkout and will be dropped overboard wednesday 
afternoon if all goes well 
the telescope being launched seven years late because of the 
1986 challenger accident and technical problems represents an 
investment of more than 2 billion 15 billion for the telescope 
itself and 600 million for spare parts astronaut training and 
ground support it will cost 200 million a year to operate and 
maintain 
the flight is deemed so important that all five of the crew are 
veterans of previous flights commander loren j shriver and pilot 
charles f bolden each have flown once before 
mission specialists bruce mccandless ii and kathryn d sullivan 
not only have flown before but also have spacewalking experience 
theyll be ready to make space walks to rectify any problems with 
the telescope and mission specialist steven a hawley whose job 
it is to operate the mechanical arm that lifts the telescope out 
has two missions under his belt 
the telescopes 94inch mirror according to experts is the 
most flawless ever made it was designed to capture and magnify 
light from nearly the farthest reaches of the universe light 
created billions of years ago when stars and solar systems were in 
their earliest stages of formation 
hubble has no rivals said lennard fisk nasas chief 
scientist never before have we had a telescope or observatory 
with this capability and it will not be surpassed until we begin 
to establish observatories on the moon some day 
above the atmosphere which distorts visible light and blocks 
out ultraviolet xrays and gamma rays the telescope will be able 
to see objects 50 times dimmer than those that can be observed from 
the ground 
with this new tool astronomers will see these celestial objects 
as they were billions of years ago that should help determine 
whether the big bang that created the universe was 10 billion years 
ago 20 billion years ago or somewhere in between as scientists 
believe 
mostly scientists stress they expect to get answers to 
questions they havent asked 
we have to be consciously expecting that we may be 
surprised said william jeffreys of the university of texas 
leader of the astrometry team and one of 1200 scientists who will 
work with results from the hubbles observations 
in the 15year life expected of the telescope scientists hope 
also to find planets around other stars 
engineers will spend about five months calibrating the 
instrument once it is in orbit but the first photographs are 
expected within two weeks of launch 
i think we have an obligation as soon as its available to put 
out a picture that shows this is really the fantastic device we 
expect it to be fisk told reporters the picture will most 
likely be of an object or objects for which good groundbased 
images are available as a basis for comparison 
astronomers gathered at the kennedy space center as if for a 
convention so did nearly 200 relatives of astronomer edwin p 
hubble who died in 1953 
in the 1920s hubble discovered that the universe is organized 
into galaxies of many sizes and shapes and that they are rushing 
away from one another 
his idea of an expanding universe gave support to the theory 
that the universe was created by an explosion

soviet jewish immigrants 
celebrated their first passover in this jewish settlement monday 
marking their ancestors release from slavery in ancient egypt and 
the modern exodus from the soviet union 
i see similarities between the passover story and the russian 
immigration said suzanna eisenvarg 38 she was among 130 new 
immigrants who joined with settlers for a passover meal in the 
elementary school gymnasium 
its delicious ms eisenvarg said as she tried the 
chorosot a pate of apple nuts and wine which represents the 
mortar that the jews used to build pyramids for egyptian pharaohs 
she recalled that in leningrad we brought matzo from the 
synagogue we would just eat matzo on that night somehow we knew 
the date the date that israelites left egypt she said 
as she spoke rabbi boris yussin a russian immigrant who lives 
in jerusalem translated the hebrew story into russian while 
israelis took turns reading from the hagada which tells the story 
of the jews flight from egypt 
mrs eisenvarg is one of about 250 soviet jews living in the 
occupied west bank a little less than 1 percent of the 29000 
immigrants who arrived in 1989 and the first three months of 1990 
the pace is apparently quickening soviet jewish immigration 
activist natan sharansky estimated the total for this year at 
200000 
the presence of soviet jews in the occupied lands has 
complicated the exodus by sparking criticism from the united states 
and galvanizing an arab campaign against all soviet immigration 
mrs eisenvarg and other new arrivals said they settled in ariel 
because unlike israel apartments were plentiful and cheap none 
cited ideological reasons for being in ariel a settlement of about 
8000 people in the heart of the west bank 
ariels mayor ron nachman said the recent arrivals had been 
calling relatives in moscow and leningrad urging them to come and 
settle in ariel 
he said that with the us policy against settlements in the 
occupied lands we have to push as much as possible for them to 
come here 
he said israel will weather the protests over the settlement of 
jews in the warwon land 
there was a pharaoh in egypt and we got through that and we 
will get through this too this immigration is a miracle he said 
reuven rosenthal 34 came to ariel eight months ago with his 
wife and two children its a nice pretty place with good cheap 
prices said rosenthal 
he said he was not concerned about the frequent clashes between 
jewish settlers and palestinian activists at his doorstep what 
should i be afraid of in the soviet union there is much more fear 
of antisemitism he said 
the gymnasium was decorated with yellow blue and purple 
streamers passover ingredients such as eggs apples wine nutmeg 
and horseradish covered the yellow clothcovered round tables 
for most soviet jews who have been cut off from jewish 
traditions all their lives this marked the first time they 
participated in a seder or passover dinner 
passover is one of the most important holidays in the jewish 
calendar 
during the meal held on the first evening of the holiday jews 
eat food symbolizing the passover themes of redemption and freedom 
and read the story of the exodus from egypt one key ingredient is 
matzo or unleavened bread symbolizing the haste with which the 
jews had to leave egypt 
while the soviet immigrants in ariel celebrated their 
homecoming their presence in the west bank continues to strain 
relations between israel and the rest of the world 
us officials say settling immigrants in the occupied lands and 
israeliannexed arab east jerusalem raises obstacles to peace last 
month secretary of state james a baker iii suggested washington 
withhold special financial aid for immigrant absorption until 
israel pledged not to settle soviet jews in the occupied lands 
arab and plo leaders fear that the expected arrival of about 
750000 soviet jews in this decade will cause more suffering to the 
palestinians they claim that palestinians will eventually be 
ousted from the west bank and gaza strip to make room for new 
arrivals from the soviet union 
in response to the arab campaign the soviet union has refused 
to ratify an agreement with israel for direct moscowtel aviv 
flights that would expedite jewish emigration soviet jews now 
arrive in israel via eastern european transit points there are 
long waits for a limited number of seats

people smeared their faces with 
ceremonial red dust and burst firecrackers monday in nationwide 
jubilation over the kings promise to reestablish a multiparty 
system in nepal 
a leftwing radical group said sundays agreement between king 
birendra and the leaders of a sevenweek campaign for democracy did 
not go far enough it pledged to continue the movement using 
violence if necessary 
before a curfew was lifted monday reports said troops shot and 
killed at least two people 
after curfew hundreds of thousands of people marched through 
katmandu and a halfdozen other towns in the himalayan kingdom to 
celebrate the agreement clinched by the nepali congress party and 
the united left front the front is a coalition of leftwing 
parties 
laughing whistling clapping and chanting victory victory 
people wound their way through the streets on foot cars 
motorpowered rickshaws and tractors 
democracy democracy we have now democracy a man shouted 
in english into a megaphone boys with handscrawled i love 
democracy posters pinned on their backs zipped around on bicycles 
today we will celebrate our freedom we have no definite plan 
but we only want to express our joy said yagya nidhi duhal his 
face smeared with red powder used by nepalese during celebrations 
most other marchers including several western tourists wore 
powder marks on their foreheads 
on sunday birendra announced he was lifting a 29yearold ban 
on political parties that has kept the rashtriya panchayat or 
national assembly nonpartisan and allowed the king to rule 
through a largely rubberstamp government 
the announcement came two days after the bloodiest day in modern 
nepalese history witnesses said as many as 200 people were killed 
when security forces opened fire to prevent prodemocracy 
demonstrators from marching to the kings palace friday the 
government said 10 people were killed and 107 injured in nationwide 
violence that day 
immediately after the royal proclamation the nepali congress 
party and the united left front said they were suspending their 
movement 
but the united national peoples movement a radical group that 
was supporting the prodemocracy campaign said monday the 
agreement to withdraw the current movement without abolishing 
the present panchayat constitution is definitely a betrayal to 
the people 
we will continue the movement until we achieve more we wont 
propagate violence but we also do not rule it out said party 
spokesman babu ram bhattarai 
bhattarai said the very fact that they want to amend the 
constitution and not form a new one means the king wants to remain 
the decisive body 
the united peoples movement is not considered a major political 
force but political observers say it commands a sizeable following 
in some towns 
prime minister lokendra chand told reporters monday a commission 
will amend the constitution to fulfill the kings promise of 
pluralistic democracy 
oblivious of the first signs of dissent among the movement 
leaders people celebrated the royal proclamation into the night 
lighting oil lamps candles and electric bulbs around their houses 
celebrations began at dawn monday when a twoday curfew was 
lifted in katmandu and two suburbs patan and bhaktapur tens of 
thousands of residents streamed out of their homes and marched 
through the main intersections and the narrow sidestreets 
sources in the nepali congress party said similar processions 
were also staged in at least a halfdozen other towns in the 
mountainous kingdom wedged between india and china 
amid the joy relatives wept at two hospitals to mourn the 
deaths of a man and a 12yearold boy shot late sunday shortly 
after the king yielded to demonstrators 
doctors at bir hospital said five other people were being 
treated for bullet wounds the people who brought the injured to 
the hospital said at least 10 other people were killed and their 
bodies taken away by troops according to the doctors who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the report could not be confirmed police denied there was any 
firing 
the governmentrun news agency rss said one person was killed in 
police firing at bharatpur in central nepal the news agency did 
not give details 
nepal last experiment with a westernstyle democracy ended in 
1961 birendras father king mahendra dismissed the government 
which at that time was led by the nepali congress party he accused 
it of corruption and inefficiency and banned political parties

voters ended the communist era by 
giving a strong mandate to the countrys main conservative party in 
what could be the genesis of a centerright trend among soviet bloc 
countries emerging into democracy 
the hungarian democratic forum campaigned on an anticommunist 
platform that incorporated universal conservative values as well as 
a strong dose of nationalism it scored an impressive victory in 
parliamentary elections that wrapped up sunday 
it was the second win in two soviet bloc elections for 
conservative forces in east germanys march 18 vote conservatives 
fell just short of a majority in the first free national elections 
in any warsaw pact country as in hungary remnants of the 
longruling communists were relegated to a relatively minor 
opposition role 
hungarys democratic forum captured 165 of the 386 seats at 
stake sunday in the first round of balloting march 25 they won 
4275 percent of the vote 
despite preliminary predictions of a close race the forum left 
the liberal league of free democrats far behind with 92 seats and 
2383 percent of the vote forcing the rival party to bury any 
aspirations of sharing a government role 
the ruling socialists created by reform communists last 
october were sent packing despite their commitment to political 
plurality they captured only 33 seats or 855 percent of the vote 
victims of widespread sentiment that they were the heirs of decades 
of repressive communist rule 
its strong position left the democratic forum independent of any 
party with which it had major differences instead it gained the 
leeway to negotiate a coalition it could dominate with the agrarian 
smallholders and christian democrats which share many of its 
conservative views 
the smallholders captured 1114 percent of the vote and the 
christian democrats were tied for fifth with 544 percent meaning 
a conservative coalition headed by the democratic forum would 
control nearly 60 percent of the legislature 
conservatives in other east european countries preparing for the 
first free elections in more than four decades clearly hope that 
the same anticommunist backlash that worked in favor of kindred 
parties in east germany and hungary will also give them an edge 
in czechoslovakia where voters go to the polls june 8 the hope 
of victory has resulted in the christian democrats in slovakia 
forging an alliance with czech centerrightists despite a general 
drifting apart of the two constituent republics only the 
conservatives have managed to formally coordinate their election 
strategies nationwide 
the slovak christian democrats led by czechoslovak deputy 
premier jan carnogursky are expected to win up to 60 percent of 
the vote in their traditionally catholic republic and the 
wellorganized alliance is likely to finish strong overall in the 
country although no one can predict how strong 
the election picture is confusing in romania where about 70 
political parties have sprung up or been revived in the wake of the 
december revolution that ended the dictatorship of nicolae 
ceausescu 
but the nations strongest conservative force the 
700000member national peasants party is given the best chance 
of defeating the national salvation front which took control of 
the country in the chaos of the revolution but was later forced to 
share power it is suspected by many conservatives of harboring 
unrepentant communists 
the peasants hand has been strengthened by an election alliance 
with the liberals and social democrats the two other leading 
parties the alliance mandates cooperation up to the may 20 
election in an effort to defeat the national salvation front 
in bulgaria the two traditional agrarian parties could pose the 
biggest threat to the stillpowerful communist party but only if 
they manage to bury differences ahead of election day june 10 
negotiations on unification of the two parties continue 
there was no clear conservative trend in poland last june when 
voters participated in their freest election in more than four 
decades they endorsed solidarity candidates sharing an 
anticommunist bent but no particular ideological platform

the bush administration suggesting congress 
is dragging its feet on aid for central america said monday it 
will spend 36 million in already appropriated funds to help the 
peace process in nicaragua 
this is just a stopgap measure said presidential press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
the money he said will be used to help the usbacked contras 
disband and resettle 
the administrations 870 million aid package bogged down in 
congress included about 30 million for that purpose 
we had hoped to get that passed before the easter recess 
congress chose to go home without acting on it well push for it 
as soon as they get back fitzwater said 
we are quite concerned about this he said we wanted to 
foster demobilization and repatriation of the contras as 
expeditiously as possible 
the administrations original package included 500 million for 
panama 300 million for nicaragua and 70 million to enlarge 
programs in the united states that benefit refugees 
however the house increased the package to 24 billion adding 
money us projects including food stamps disaster relief 
fighting forest fires and veterans programs the senate has yet to 
act on the legislation 
fitzwater said the 36 million would come from what was left 
over from an earlier 47 million humanitarian aid package for 
nicaragua 
we believe that the money is needed there that it is a worthy 
cause that the united states has pushed for this as the ultimate 
goal of its policy for years and that we do have a responsibility 
to make this money available fitzwater said 
the 30 million in the administrations package that would be 
earmarked for repatriation includes 2 million to help finance a 
united nations observer group that will receive the weapons of 
resistance members who demobilize 
at the state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler called 
the 36 million start up money for the repatriation and 
resettlement operations including money for the un group 
both politically and financially the united states supports 
the voluntary demobilization repatriation and reintegration of 
contra rebels and their families she said 
she said both the un and the organization of american states 
had been informed of our intention to move quickly to disperse 
these dollars 
administration officials said the government is prepared to 
provide funds for food and medical care for the contras both in 
honduras and nicaragua 
the 36 million is the remaining amount from a central american 
humanitarian aid package approved by congress last year to carry 
out its bipartisan accord with the white house

novelist mario vargas llosa once considered a 
sure bet to become perus next president has found himself 
sidetracked by the fujimori phenomenon 
alberto fujimori the son of japanese immigrants and a political 
unknown until a month ago forced the countrys most famous 
novelist into a runoff and is now favored to win the presidency 
public opinion analysts say fujimoris strong secondplace 
finish in sundays election reflected peruvians alienation from 
the traditional political parties and their desire for 
miraculous painless solutions to the countrys ills 
it was not a rational vote it was a protest vote against the 
other candidates said alfredo torres media director for apoyo 
a market research firm 
fujimori a 51yearold agricultural engineer received 29 
percent of the vote sunday to 339 percent for the 54yearold 
vargas llosa according to unofficial returns the writer needed a 
majority of the votes cast to avoid a runoff which now most likely 
will take place in early june 
luis alva castro candidate of the governing leftofcenter 
aprista party received 164 percent two marxist candidates 
collected 11 percent of the vote between them the remaining votes 
were divided among four minor candidates and blank and void ballots 
official results will not be available for weeks but the 
unofficial results represented a slap in the face to vargas llosa 
who campaigned hard for two years and as late as midfebruary had 
more than 50 percent support in polls 
campaigning on a shoestring budget fujimori shot up from less 
than 1 percent in polls six weeks ago to nearly surpass vargas 
llosa 
vargas llosas campaign often seemed like a crusade running on 
a freemarket platform he harshly attacked the collectivist 
programs of president alan garcia and the proposals of leftist 
candidates 
many peruvians blame garcia for perus worst economic crisis of 
the century and the growing political violence that is tearing 
apart this andean country of 22 million 
inflation is running at more than 2000 percent annually more 
than 18000 people most of them civilians have died violently in 
a decadelong struggle between shining path guerrillas and security 
forces 
vargas llosa was asking for a clear mandate from peruvians to 
carry out radical reforms aimed at undoing two decades of socialist 
policies he blames for perus stagnation 
i have put aside my career because i think there is a real 
chance to change the history of peru vargas llosa said in the 
closing days of the campaign 
analysts say peruvian voters dismayed by two decades of 
economic decline and falling living standards were looking for 
someone with magical solutions to the countrys problems 
the spotlight fell on fujimori they say after voters in recent 
weeks began to fear the economic shock therapy and harsh austerity 
measures advocated by vargas llosa 
no one likes to go to the dentist even when his tooth hurts 
and thats what vargas llosa offered manuel dornellas editor 
of the expreso newspaper wrote in a column monday 
terrified by the governments disgraceful propaganda campaign 
against the socalled shock many people have fled vargas llosas 
proposed surgery to take shelter in fujimoris oriental nirvana 
dornellas said 
fujimori is an agronomist and former university rector his 
campaign has stressed honor technology and work qualities 
many here associate with his japanese ancestry peru has a large 
number of people who trace their roots to japanese immigrants 
public opinion analysts say fujimori has awakened hopes in 
voters that he will be able to attract massive japanese aid and 
investment if elected 
the analysts say voters also were turned off by the 
multimilliondollar campaign waged by the centerright democratic 
front coalition supporting vargas llosa

iraq on monday ordered a us diplomat to 
leave the country in retaliation for the us expulsion of an iraqi 
envoy accused of involvement in a murder plot 
the foreign ministry announcement carried by the official iraqi 
news agency did not name the american the state department in 
washington confirmed the expulsion but did not identify the 
diplomat 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said of the expulsion we 
deplore iraqs unjust action and believe it was totally 
inappropriate 
since the restoration of diplomatic ties in 1985 us relations 
with iraq have been complex and sometimes disturbing ms 
tutwiler said iraq should understand that such actions the 
expulsion only tend to exacerbate our relations 
the iraqi news agency quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman 
as saying the american action over the weekend was part of 
repeated hysterical campaigns to harm iraq in order to serve the 
aggressive purposes of israel 
the accusation against the iraqi diplomat has no basis in 
truth he said 
the state department said saturday it expelled an unidentified 
iraqi diplomat posted at the united nations because he was 
suspected of involvement in an alleged plot to murder two opponents 
of the baghdad government 
state department spokeswoman anita stockman on saturday said the 
department could only say that the expulsion was linked to an 
investigation in california us government sources said on 
condition of anonymity the expulsion involved a plot to assassinate 
two iraqi opposition members in the united states 
a newspaper in california identified the targets of the plot as 
sargon dadesho a leader of the assyrian community in californias 
central valley and an unidentified kurdish leader kurds in iraq 
have been fighting for autonomy

sudden snags in talks to cut longrange 
nuclear weapons wont affect plans for next months superpower 
summit between president bush and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev the white house said monday 
we have a lot of things to talk about in our relationship 
besides arms control said white house press secretary marlin 
fitzwater 
we are prepared to go ahead with the summit regardless of what 
happens on the arms control part of it 
problems in reaching an arms agreement arent the only cloud 
hanging over the summit bush has warned moscow that a crackdown in 
the secessionist republic of lithuania would mar superpower 
relations and threaten progress across the entire superpower agenda 
bush and gorbachev are to meet in the united states for five 
days beginning may 30 
the centerpiece of the second meeting between bush and gorbachev 
was to have been the signing of an outline of a treaty to cut 
strategic nuclear weapons 
however prospects for an agreement diminished last week after 
the united states and soviet union reported little progress during 
three days of highlevel talks in washington 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the two sides 
remained at odds over airlaunched and sealaunched cruise 
missiles which have long been a key obstacle to reaching a 
strategic arms reduction treaty 
us officials said privately that the soviet union had pulled 
back in some areas where the two sides previously agreed 
fitzwater said the bush administration remained hopeful as it 
had during the first bushgorbachev summit at malta that an 
agreement could be reached in time for the summit 
if the emphasis is on the word doable which is the new word 
i think that there is certainly a great question whether or not 
its doable that we would have a treaty he said 
i think theres an open question about whether all major 
points would be resolved at this time 
on the other hand fitzwater said it was not unusual that 
problems crop up as negotiations approach a conclusion 
as you get nearer the end people get a little nervous and 
start having second thoughts and trying to employ a little 
lastminute advantage and so forth fitzwater said lets hope 
that thats what it is and that we can resume progress 
another attempt to break the arms deadlock will be made when 
baker goes to the soviet union for talks with soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze on may 1619 
meanwhile an adminstration official confirmed that bush had 
written to gorbachev proposing a ban on all landbased strategic 
missiles carrying multiple warheads 
gorbachev in a response delivered friday by shevardnadze said 
the us plan was too limited and should include seabased missiles 
as well as those deployed on land said the official who refused 
to be identified 
the us and soviet positions reflect the different ways the two 
superpowers have structured their nuclear arsenals 
the united states has deployed most of its nuclear warheads at 
sea while the soviet union has deployed most of its warheads on 
land 
baker at a news conference friday refused to discuss the issue 
of multiplewarhead weapons 
there are some things we just dont comment on and 
particularly if theres some chance that they are under 
consideration as part of our negotiations baker said

most manufacturers of cosmetics are not 
signing up for voluntary federal oversight according to a report 
to congress released monday 
a congressman who wants to increase oversight of the 18 billion 
industry said the report raises safety questions 
the food and drug administration has no authority to require 
safety testing of personalcare products which includes everything 
from toothpaste to bubble bath or to force manufacturers to report 
safety data or cosmeticsrelated injuries noted the report by the 
general accounting office the investigating arm of congress 
most people think somebody approves these products in advance 
that the government would have access to safety data that 
theres a review of the chemicals in the products but thats not 
what goes on here rep ron wyden dore who requested the 
report said in an interview 
wyden is chairman of the small business subcommittee on 
regulation 
he said the food drug and cosmetic act on the books since 
1938 needs to be rewritten to require cosmetics manufacturers to 
register with the fda and provide the agency with data on safety 
tests and injury reports he said he expects to introduce 
legislation to that effect later this year 
the cosmetics toiletry and fragrance association defended the 
industry saying there isnt a serious safety problem if 
there was the agency would know about it and the public would 
know about it 
the association the main trade organization for the cosmetics 
industry has been encouraging manufacturers to register 
voluntarily with the fda and has been collecting and reviewing 
safety data on chemicals used in cosmetics said michael petrina 
the groups vice president for legislative relations 
the fda has plenty of information now to make any judgments to 
deal with any safety concerns he said we dont think the fda 
needs any more authority to regulate we dont think it makes 
any sense to divert their scarce resources to an industry that has 
a demonstrated safety record 
the gao report said that according to fda estimates there are 
about 2000 to 2500 cosmetics manufacturers and about twice as 
many distributors 
the drug agencys records show that 778 or 31 percent to 39 
percent had registered with the agency as of july 1989 compared 
with about 40 percent in 1977 the report said 
the trade association says the total number of manufacturers is 
no more than 2000 and the number registered is closer to 60 
percent and the group notes that the 778 registered last year was 
94 more than in july 1988 
about 3 percent of the estimated 4000 to 5000 distributors 
have reported adverse effects of personalcare products to the fda 
the report said 
the fda can inspect manufacturers collect samples and go to 
court to force products off the market if it finds safety problems 
but the report noted that only companies that register with the 
fda will be inspected because otherwise the agency doesnt know 
they exist also unless a company reports safetytesting data to 
the agency their products wont be reviewed by the fda 
because it is a voluntary program fda will never be able 
to require reporting from all companies particularly those that 
may be least likely to report because they have experienced 
problems with their cosmetics the report said 
the report also said fda officials have said their investigators 
have found many manufacturers lack adequate data on safety tests of 
their products and unless there is a problem refuse to disclose 
the results of their safety tests 
an fda spokesman said agency officials had not yet seen the 
report and had no immediate comment 
cosmetic products sold to consumers must list ingredients on the 
label but that regulation does not apply to products sold for use 
in business establishments like beauty salons the report said 
wyden said he is particularly concerned that the fda had not 
done its own assessments of the4 health effects of 884 chemicals 
available for use in cosmetics that are listed in the governments 
registry of toxic effects of chemical substances 
petrina said his association has reviewed the chemicals and 
found that many are not used in personalcare products of those 
that are none poses a safety problem in the small quantities in 
which it used he said

thousands of georgians chanting 
occupiers occupiers rallied outside a soviet military base 
monday capping a day of protests recalling a bloody clash that 
sparked their republics independence movement 
the day of commemorations drew almost 200000 people to three 
separate rallies it served as a show of strength by independence 
activists who have scored several major victories in the past month 
soldiers assaulted a peaceful proindependence protest in front 
of government buildings in tbilisi on april 9 1989 with shovels 
and gas nineteen people died 
the attack unleashed bitter criticism across the country 
several investigations have placed the blame for ordering the 
attack as high as the communist party politburo but no one has 
been blamed officially 
protesters near the caucasus military district headquarters 
posted signs reading get out of georgia and depicting a 
hooded executioner wearing a military star and holding a bloody 
shovel 
early monday morning about 100000 people gathered in 
candlelight on rustavelli boulevard the site of the clash about 
70000 more nearly filled the republics main stadium monday 
evening in a similar rally 
at an intersection outside the walled military base about 
10000 people gathered in the afternoon and shouted through 
megaphones for the soldiers to abandon their posts 
eldar shengelaya a wellknown georgian director addressed the 
soldiers as esteemed occupiers and told them the army could 
turn them into beasts 
think he said this is your last chance to turn into 
people 
there was no visible reaction from the few soldiers seen on the 
base authorities did not interfere with the protest and georgian 
policeman helped keep order 
protests in other soviet republics have included antimilitary 
elements among them calls to boycott the draft but mondays 
demonstration was one of the largest directed specifically against 
the soviet military 
top soviet generals have complained in recent months about a 
growing campaign to discredit the army particularly in 
republics with rising independence movements 
in the baltic republics this springs military callup is 
expected to bring large numbers of draft dodgers and georgians 
said they expect the same 
georgia is not the only republic with a strong independence 
movement the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia 
moldavia and the neighboring caucasus republics of azerbaijan and 
armenia also have strong independence movements 
lithuanias is the strongest it declared itself independent 
from the soviet union on march 11 and the standoff with the 
kremlin continues in moscow on monday soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and his top advisory body said new economic and political 
steps would be taken to break lithuanian intransigence no details 
were given 
the leader of latvias supreme soviet said monday he is certain 
latvian legislators also will vote to secede from the soviet union 
when they meet next month but that the independence process will 
be gradual 
zviad gamsakhurdia an independence activist long considered the 
dean of georgian dissident told reporters sunday the april 9 
anniversary was a day of great sorrow but also a day of 
victory for georgians 
on this day the georgian soul was revived he said april 
9 was the beginning of the national democratic revolution of 
georgia which is continuing 
he said only a small percentage of georgians favored 
independence before the clash last april 9 but that now the vast 
majority favor independence from moscow 
on march 9 the georgian supreme soviet or parliament 
condemned what it said was the republics forced annexation to the 
soviet union and demanded negotiations on restoring independence 
later the same month lawmakers put off local elections to give 
opponents to the communists a chance to organize 
at mondays protest speakers urged parents to help their 
children evade the draft the protest ended with a mass recitation 
of the lords prayer 
at the stadium rally later electric scoreboards read in 
eternal memory of the innocents killed april 9 
among the guests on the field were five 8yearold girls in 
white voile who recited poems and a prayer in honor of two 
schoolmates who died in the clash 
most of the rally focused on hardcore politics 
gamsakhurdia read a list of 23 demands to the soviet government 
they included cancellation of military service for georgians 
declaration that the april 9 clash was genocide against the 
georgian people and punishment of those responsible 
the thousands in the stands raised their hands to show their 
approval 
irakly tsereteli head of the radical national independence 
party called for gandhistyle civil disobedience to further the 
push for independence 
the soviet tv news program vremya gave prominent and 
sympathetic play to the memorial service 
gorbachev offered his condolences to georgia on sunday but 
independence activists dismissed them as empty words

a top economic adviser to president mikhail s 
gorbachev said monday that authorities will have to overcome strong 
public resistance to push through a radical marketoriented 
economic reform program this year 
a speedy transition to a market economy will come up against 
powerful opposition deputy prime minister leonid abalkin told a 
news conference we must do it whether we like it or not 
what we must do first is to make all people understand and see 
clearly that without such a transition the country has no future 
as a highly developed great power 
as he answered reporters questions abalkin repeatedly dodged 
specifics implying that key decisions in the reform program had 
not yet been made for example he said the state must lift 
controls on prices but would not specify which prices would be 
freed or when 
he also denied reports circulating among the foreign business 
community that some form of convertible ruble would be introduced 
by this summer he said experts believe the soviet market must have 
something to sell first and it will take years before the countrys 
currency will be convertible 
several officials have suggested in recent weeks that the soviet 
union was considering a plan to provide a polishstyle shock 
therapy for the soviet economy which would boost prices 
drastically cut the value of the ruble and raise unemployment 
in december premier nikolai i ryzhkov outlined to the soviet 
congress an economic program calling for five more years of central 
planning with a gradual introduction of some elements of a market 
economy it further delayed a reform of prices which are currently 
set by bureaucrats without regard to the cost of production 
but in march just after he was given a new powerful post as 
president gorbachev said more radical economic reforms were 
urgently needed 
the reforms are being speeded up due to destabilization of the 
political system development of ethnic and regional conflicts and 
deficits in the consumer goods market abalkin said 
with the economy stalled partway between central planning and a 
market system industrial production fell 12 percent in the first 
quarter of 1990 compared with the last quarter of 1989 
unless we go over to the new methods we will deprive 
ourselves and our children of a highly developed and efficient 
economy and a powerful country where people will want to live and 
which the people will not be ashamed of abalkin said 
we will have to make sacrifices he added but there must 
be a social consensus for that 
state price committee chief vyacheslav senchagov told the 
legislature last week that among the three reform variants under 
consideration was the polish example of a crash program to create a 
maret economy 
poland hopes the abrupt transformation will keep the painful 
period short and the inflation rate has already fallen drastically 
from the tripledigit level of january 
but abalkin said the soviet government cannot count on public 
support for such a policy 
he left unsaid the fact that polands shock program was 
instituted by the new solidarityled government which replaced the 
unpopular communists last august

lothar de maiziere the prime 
ministerdesignate proposed a cabinet on monday that includes the 
major political parties and has a peace activist as defense 
minister 
the christian democrat leader unveiled the tentative composition 
of east germanys first democratic government after negotiations 
with the nations diverse political groups 
parliament is expected to vote on nominations to the 24member 
cabinet on thursday 
agreement was reached in five days of talks with the social 
democrats who finished second to the christian democrats in east 
germanys first free elections march 18 
differences between the two main parties still exist on the pace 
and form of eventual unification with west germany including how 
much of the socialist welfare state should be retained for east 
germans who depend on food and housing subsidies 
german reunification was the main issue in the elections and 
remains the overriding priority but agreement on a cabinet clears 
a major hurdle de maizieres government would replace communist 
caretaker administrations that have run the country since the 
prodemocracy revolt in october 
a threeparty conservative alliance led by de maiziere would 
dominate the new cabinet with 14 seats the social democrats would 
have seven posts and three would go to a smaller liberal alliance 
eleven of the 24 seats actually were filled with talks to 
continue tuesday on naming the rest of the ministers 
social democrat leader markus meckel was nominated to be foreign 
minister 
the social democrats also will hold the post of finance minister 
and named walter romberg a key negotiator with bonn over the 
planned monetary union 
rainer eppelmann who leads the democratic awakening party part 
of de maizieres alliance was chosen defense minister his 
ministrys name was changed to department of defense and 
disarmament a symbolic reference to german demands for fewer 
nuclear weapons in superpower military stategy 
eppelmann a lutheran minister and peace activist who took part 
in the revolt against stalinist leader erich honecker probably 
will play a role in talks on a united germanys future role in the 
eastern and western military alliances 
leaders of the social democrats expressed satisfaction with 
mondays talks but party spokesman guenther krug said 
substantial differences that remain would be the subject of 
further negotiations 
we assume that difficult negotiations lie ahead krug said 
although de maizieres alliance won the most seats in the 
400member parliament it lacks the twothirds majority needed to 
enact constitutional changes that would allow quick unification 
with west germany 
a coalition with the social democrats would give de maiziere 
control if negotiations with that party fail he can try for 
agreements with other parties 
de maiziere supports rapid reunification of germany as does 
chancellor helmut kohl of west germany but the social democrats 
favor a more gradual process 
they also differ on the role of an east german government which 
faces severe economic problems but also is likely to be a 
shortlived transitional administration 
among issues still to be clarified are west germanys role in 
nato east germanys membership in the warsaw pact and the 
difficult question of private property 
east germans have not been allowed to own land and west germans 
have made claims on property their ancestors owned before the 
nation was divided after world war ii 
social democratic leaders want employees to share in former 
stateowned companies but the christian democrats favor complete 
sale to private owners 
the parliament elected march 18 convened april 4 and 
designated de maiziere as prime minister it also began dismantling 
the 40yearold communist system and created an office of president 
sabine bergmannpohl president of parliament was named acting 
national president and assumed her duties as head of state monday 
she urged a quick conclusion of the coalition talks installation 
of a new government and choice of a permanent president 
hanging like a cloud over the process of building a new 
political order are allegations that some members of the new 
parliament had ties to the reviled secret police of the old 
communist regime 
de maiziere has denied such allegations in his own case two 
other accused political leaders have resigned 
parliament is expected to vote on whether to form an independent 
commission to investigate the allegations the former secret police 
agency has been disbanded

a deputy premier said monday that it now is the 
government and not communist party leaders who are making the 
key policy decisions in the soviet union 
the comment by deputy premier leonid abalkin at a news 
conference on economic reform was an indication the 12man 
communist party politburo might be following through on mikhail s 
gorbachevs plan for the party to hand over some of its power to 
the government and permit a multiparty system 
gorbachev became the countrys first executive president on 
march 15 and has formed new government advisory groups including a 
presidential council 
answering a question on proposed economic reforms abalkin said 
the politburo will not be making any decisions from now on and 
it is already not making the decisions decisions can be made by 
the president the parliament and the congress of peoples 
deputies those are the decisionmaking entities now 
abalkin however is neither a full nor nonvoting member of the 
politburo he did not elaborate

president mikhail s gorbachev and his 
presidential council said monday that new economic and political 
steps will be taken to break lithuanias unyielding stand on 
independence 
the advisory bodys tough statement indicated the conflict is 
far from resolved despite a highlevel meeting last week and 
conciliatory words by both sides 
lithuania told gorbachev on thursday it was ready to negotiate 
with moscow but did not intend to bow to his order that it back 
away from its march 11 declaration of independence before any talks 
could begin 
the soviet union forcibly annexed lithuania estonia and latvia 
in 1940 
members of the presidential council concluded that additional 
economic political and other measures should be taken to protect 
the soviet constitution and the interests of citizens living in the 
republic and the soviet union as a whole the tass news agency 
reported monday 
it did not say what kinds of steps the council had in mind 
gorbachev has ordered lithuanians to turn in their firearms and 
told the republic not to form unarmed patrols the soviet military 
has arrested some lithuanian deserters who left after their 
homeland declared its independence and has occupied several public 
buildings in lithuanias capital vilnius 
but after a meeting last week between lithuanian representatives 
and a major gorbachev adviser politburo member alexander n 
yakovlev both sides were making conciliatory statements 
on sunday however a crowd of lithuanians prevented hundreds of 
soviet soldiers from entering a plant that prints proindependence 
newspapers promoscow communists had ordered the plant to shut 
down 
quoting the presidential council tass said monday the reply 
by the lithuanian supreme soviet was not constructive and did not 
open an avenue toward settling problems in fact it leads matters 
to a dead end 
the present lithuanian leadership is blocking any exit from 
the crisis with its anticonstitutional actions and the escalation 
of illegal measures it is aggravating the situation in the 
republic for which it bears full responsibility 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis speaking before the 
latest salvo from the kremlin was quoted by tass as complaining 
that moscow does not want talks or even preliminary good will 
contacts with lithuania 
the republic also told its young men who will be called up in 
the soviet draft this spring that it is up to them whether they 
want to serve 
refusal to serve in the soviet armed forces will not be 
considered a criminal offense according to official lithuanian 
radio monitored by the british broadcasting corp in london 
in moscow national deputies opposing lithuanias independence 
drive asked gorbachev to dissolve the lithuanian legislature and 
reiterated its demand for direct presidential rule 
on monday estonian leaders decided to send a draft response to 
gorbachevs criticism of their bid for independence to legislative 
committees for debate a local journalist reported speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
estonia has declared soviet rule occupation of an independent 
country and voted to reestablish independence at the end of a 
stillundefined transition period gorbachev has demanded estonia 
back down 
latvias new communist party chief alfreds rubiks asked a 
minority group of members who walked out of the party congress over 
the weekend not to follow lithuanians and estonians by establishing 
an independent party 
most delegates voted to keep party ties with moscow the 
minority wants an independent communist party and moved to 
establish it this month 
anatolijs gorbunovs president of latvias supreme soviet or 
parliament said monday he is certain latvian legislators will vote 
to secede from the soviet union when they meet next month but full 
separation is to be achieved in negotiations and discussions 
he spoke at a news conference in geneva where he attended a 
symposium

a former policeman who contended that 
insanity drugs alcohol and the movie apocalypse now drove him 
to the shotgun killing of an envied neighbor was convicted monday 
of firstdegree murder 
robert mclaughlin 49 of hampton stood expressionless as the 
verdict was read the rockingham county superior court which 
deliberated more than three days also found him guilty of 
conspiracy to commit murder 
mclaughlin faces an automatic prison sentence of life without 
parole no date for sentencing was set mclaughlins attorney 
michael iacopino said the conviction would be appealed to the 
state supreme court 
he deserves to spend his life in prison for all the hurt hes 
caused said mclaughlins son robert jr who was a witness for 
the prosecution 
the twisted case began when former teacher robert cushing 63 a 
successful real estate agent was killed by two shotgun blasts when 
he answered the door of his home the night of june 1 1988 while 
his wife sat in another room 
the shooting shocked the seaside community of 12000 police 
were baffled until mclaughlin an 18year hampton police officer 
who was not a suspect surrendered that august he admitted the 
shooting then recanted 
mclaughlins wife susan 38 was charged with being an 
accomplice to murder she was convicted and sentenced to life 
without parole 
at his pretrial hearings mclaughlin testified that his wife had 
killed cushing and his lawyers produced letters she wrote 
mclaughlin from prison in which she admitted killing cushing 
then without explanation mclaughlins lawyers quit the case 
and it was delayed more than six months while new lawyers were 
found and prepared his defense meanwhile mclaughlins wife 
obtained a divorce 
when the trial began his awyers acknowledged mclaughlin pulled 
the trigger but pleaded insanity saying he was under the 
influence of alcohol the tranquilizer xanax and had just watched 
the violent vietnam movie apocalypse now on the night of the 
shooting 
after several trial delays a threeweek trial and more than 
three days of deliberations assistant attorney general michael 
ramsdell said finally justice has been done 
the victims son robert cushing jr said there is no joy in 
any of this he and other members of the family wept as the 
verdict was read 
the one thing i hope now is we can go on and have a healing 
not just for our family but for bobby mclaughlin their 
families and the community he said 
in closing arguments prosecutor barbara keshen contrasted a 
desperately unhappy mclaughlin with a contented successful 
cushing 
the two had been feuding for 13 years since mclaughlin 
investigated a traffic accident outside cushings home in which 
cushing an onlooker was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge 
mclaughlin was cleared of brutality charges

searchers poking through the rubble of 
a residential hotel razed by a fastmoving fire found three more 
bodies monday raising the death toll to nine authorities said 
as many as 60 searchers from several agencies used trained dogs 
and construction equipment to search the threestory fontana hotel 
six residents of the 39yearold hotel still are listed as missing 
one body found monday was on the top floor in the rear away 
from the most severe fire damage another victim was found in the 
lobby area where the roof caved in during the predawn fire 
friday police detective tom hoolahan said the third body was 
found in an elevator 
the search for bodies is slowed by the meticulous examination of 
fragments from the 102room hotel located between miami beachs 
trendy art deco district and a strip of luxury highrise 
condominiums 
crews are studying each charred board and sifting ashes and 
burned debris looking for any clues to the fires origin and the 
victims identities the searchers included arson investigators 
from the city and state fire marshals office and the us bureau 
of alcohol firearms and tobacco 
detective jim hyde said it may be two weeks before a final 
determination is made on the cause of the fire the worst in the 
seaside city in nearly 20 years 
many of the nearly 100 residents who escaped the fire have taken 
temporary shelter at nearby hotels or with family members 
the fontana complied with current fire regulations according to 
city officials and was equipped with smoke detectors in each room 
but the hotel did not have sprinklers which are required by law 
beginning in 1991

riots flared last weekend in moslem areas near 
chinas border with the soviet union a western diplomat said 
monday 
speaking on the condition of anonymity the diplomat said an 
official from the zinjiang uygur autonomous region confimed reports 
of civil unrest in the area 
the disturbances erupted over the past few days near kashgar a 
bazaar city near chinas arid border with the soviet republics of 
tadzhikistan and kirghizia said the diplomat who had no further 
information 
the foreign affairs office in urumqi capital of xinjiang would 
neither confirm nor deny the reports it said merely it was not 
clear when asked if troops were dispatched to quell rioting 
in xinjiangs government office in beijing an official said he 
did not know if reports that kashgar was closed to foreigners were 
true 
more than half xinjiangs population of 14 million are from the 
uygur hui and other moslem groups with close ethnic ties to soviet 
moslems moslem riots occurred in urumqi last may and relations 
between local minorities and the beijing government have long been 
tense 
all foreign journalists and diplomats have been barred from 
xinjiang since the outbreak of ethnic unrest in adjacent republics 
of the soviet union 
the sparsely populated desert province also borders tibet 
another province where resentment against chinese rule has become 
violent in recent years 
the china international tourist service claimed foreign tourists 
could still go to kashgar but said they would have to leave from 
the urumqi the provinical capital on a 700mile bus trip 
xinjiang officials in recent months have repeatedly warned of 
separatists trying to stir up trouble 
xinjiangs delegates to the justconcluded annual session of 
chinas legislature called for increased vigilance against a 
small number of separatists who present the greatest threat to 
xinjiangs stability 
the regions communist party chief song hanliang said after a 
tour of kashgar and other areas of southern xinjiang in february 
that every place and work unit now has some hot spot problems 
he called for strengthened control over religious activities 
saying the government must not allow religion to be used to promote 
separatist tendencies

a powerful land mine 
exploded under a land rover on monday morning killing four 
soldiers and throwing the military vehicle 30 feet in the air two 
motorists also were injured 
the irish republican armys south down brigade claimed 
responsibility for the attack which prime minister margaret 
thatcher linked to recent decisions by the irish supreme court not 
to extradite prisoners wanted in northern ireland on terrorism 
charges 
irish prime minister charles haughey discounted thatchers 
statements 
i dont think anybody could seriously believe that the people 
who carry out these atrocities could have any regard for the 
decisions of any court haughey said they follow their own 
futile agenda 
northern ireland secretary peter brooke the british government 
minister responsible for the province said actions of this sort 
are wholly senseless in that they will not deflect us from our 
intention to defend the community against these evil men 
the explosion occurred just before 8 am near the downpatrick 
race course in county down in the southeast part of the province 
the area was quickly sealed off and police and soldiers were 
airlifted in to search for clues 
police said the blast created a crater 15 feet deep and 40 feet 
wide and hurled the vehicle into a nearby field crushed like a 
sardine tin 
several other soldiers traveling in front in another land rover 
suffered shock said a spokesman for the royal ulster constabulary 
the soldiers were members of the ulster defense regiment the 
mainly protestant locally recruited regiment of the british army 
said the spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with british 
custom 
a pair of overalls was found a halfmile from the site of the 
explosion security chiefs then warned all police and army units 
that an attack might be imminent 
on friday the irish supreme court ruled not to extradite owen 
carron a former northern ireland member of parliament saying he 
was a political prisoner 
you take these murders of these four people today alongside 
those decisions in the supreme court of the republic not to 
extradite those accused of violent crime and one is very very 
depressed mrs thatcher said 
violent crime is not political its common criminal she 
said 
the court had issued a similar ruling earlier three weeks 
earlier in which it refused to extradite escaped prisoners saying 
they would be subject to assault by prison guards if they were 
returned 
the irish republican army is fighting to end british rule in 
northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province 
with the roman catholic republic of ireland

after a night of celebration leaders 
of the conservative party that won elections ending 43 years of 
communist rule began working monday to form a centerright 
governing coalition 
the hungarian democratic forum won nearly 43 percent of the 
vote securing 165 of the 386 house seats contested in sundays 
balloting and in a first round of elections two weeks ago 
according to unofficial results 
no one should be blinded by the euphoria of victory the 
partys president jozsef antall told a news conference monday 
referring to the agrarian independent smallholders and the 
christian democrats antall said we have the possibility of 
forming a solid government with our possible coalition partners 
both parties are ideologically close to the democratic forum in 
their emphasis on christian values and a generally conservative 
outlook 
the smallholders were third with 11 percent of the vote and the 
christian democrats tied for fifth with more than 5 percent 
according to the unofficial results the smallholders got 43 
seats and the christian democrats 21 official results were not 
expected before tuesday 
leaders of the smallholders and the christian democrats told 
separate news conferences they were interested in a coalition with 
the democratic forum 
such a union would force the secondstrongest party the liberal 
league of free democrats and its ideological ally the league of 
young democrats into the opposition they would likely be joined 
by the former communists now grouped into the socialist party 
the free democrats won about 24 percent of parliament with 92 
seats the young democrats were tied with the christian democrats 
for 21 seats and the ruling socialist party was fourth with more 
than 8 percent for 33 seats 
antall said it would take at least a month to form a new 
government which is expected to introduce market forces into the 
economy crippled after decades of centralized control under the 
communists it also faces a 20 billion foreign debt 
the forum favors a more gradual approach to economic reform to 
soften the effects of inevitable inflation and unemployment 
the free democrats formed by former leading dissidents 
campaigned on a platform for quicker change 
in apparent reference to his partys chief rival the free 
democrats antall said he would like to rely on the other side as 
well 
antall ruled out cooperation with the socialist party which was 
formed last year by communist reformers 
an additional eight seats in the 394 seat house will be 
allocated to representatives of the national minorities 
the conservative victory was the second in the two free 
elections held in the east bloc this year in east germany where 
eastern europes first free elections were held march 18 
conservatives also gained a clear victory the communists were 
relegated to a relatively unimportant opposition role

a history of polands tumultuous 70s by 
former communist party leader edward gierek topped local bestseller 
lists as poles stood in blocklong lines monday to buy copies of 
his memoir 
the aborted decade is a 201page book that features a 
series of interviews of gierek by journalist janusz rolicki 
conducted from november to february 
despite its relatively high local price of 528 lines quickly 
formed to buy the book which was sold from the backs of trucks and 
sidewalk tables 
much of the interest appeared to stem from a desire for a 
behindthescenes look at the countrys recent political history 
despite his being deposed in 1980 the 77yearold gierek is 
remembered fondly by many poles for raising the standard of living 
by borrowing heavily from abroad the loans contributed in great 
part to polands 40 billion debt which it still is unable to pay 
the debt and subsequent economic problems led to the birth and 
rise of solidarity the first independent labor union in the soviet 
bloc gierek legalized solidarity in 1980 but because of the 
unions growing demands coupled with pressing economic problems he 
was forced to retire 
gierek first secretary of the party from 197080 is polands 
first communist ruler to return to the public eye after being 
ousted the ruling communists fell from power last year at the 
beginning of the east european reforms and in its wake the 
solidarityled government was created 
there was no chance to publish this before gierek admits in 
a postscript to the paperback issued by a private publisher fakt 
he says the communist party leadership during the 1980s rejected 
his repeated requests for an objective reassessment of the 1970s 
a nations forgetting or falsifying its past loses the proper 
perspective for coming years he wrote 
the history of peoples poland is not a history of a wild and 
festering struggle by society against the authorities first of all 
it is a history of the life of several generations full of bright 
and dark spots 
he also said he had been imprisoned and laughed at and later 
condemned to ignomity and humiliation without the right to 
defend himself 
gierek was briefly interned after martial law was declared in 
poland in 1981 the imprisonment was an effort by the countrys 
leaders to portray the crackdown as being aimed at both rebellious 
union leaders and corrupt party officials 
he had come to power as the first secretary of the polish united 
workers party in december 1970 succeeding wladyslaw gomulka who 
was forced out after security forces opened fire on polish workers 
in the baltic cities of gdansk and gdynia killing scores

an inmate with alleged ties to salems drug 
underworld was arraigned monday on aggravated murder charges in the 
slaying of oregons top prison official over a year ago 
authorities announced monday 
frank e gable was charged in an indictment returned friday and 
released monday with six counts of aggravated murder and one of 
murder he was being held without bail pending another court 
appearance next week 
gable 30 who had been serving a jail term for assaulting his 
wife and was due to be released thursday in recent months had 
become the focus of the inquiry into the january 1989 stabbing 
death of corrections chief michael francke 
the slaying resulted in the states most extensive criminal 
investigation and also sparked accusations that department of 
corrections employees were somehow involved in franckes death 
however various investigations failed to substantiate claims of a 
conspiracy 
francke 42 who had been recruited from new mexico to run 
oregons prisons was attacked as he was leaving work for the day 
and walking to his car parked outside the corrections department 
office an autopsy showed he died of a stab wound to the heart 
one of the counts against gable alleges that franckes death was 
related to his duties as corrections director others said gable 
killed francke in an attempt to cover up an armed robbery or theft 
marion county district attorney dale penn said at a news 
conference that those alternative theories would be presented 
at trial and that it would be up to a jury to decide which is the 
most credible 
at least one jail inmate has testified that gable said he killed 
francke during a bungled car burglary some inmates have told 
authorities gable worked as a collector for drug traffickers but 
others have described gable as a smalltime dealer who used drugs 
himself 
penn said his office would seek the death penalty if gable were 
convicted of aggravated murder 
gable who has denied any involvement in franckes death said 
monday he was not surprised by the indictment 
i just ask that they not stop looking gable said in an 
interview theres a killer out there somewhere dont let me get 
railroaded for this 
gable has said that other inmates have been trying to implicate 
him in the slaying because he once worked as an informant for the 
keizer police department

moscows opposition to lithuanian independence 
can be compared to abraham lincolns fight to keep the south from 
seceding a soviet official said monday 
yuri a reshetov head of the soviet foreign ministrys 
department for international humanitarian cooperation and human 
rights told a news conference he visited washingtons lincoln 
memorial on sunday 
the american civil war president in his second inaugural 
address in 1865 said that he is fighting against the forces which 
are seeking to dissolve the union abraham lincoln saved the 
american union reshetov said 
we have been together with lithuania with estonia and with 
latvia for many many years he said i still hope that what 
unites us is much stronger than what is capable of leading to 
dissolution of our union 
reshetov argued that lithuanias fate should be decided by a 
popular vote rather than by the march 11 declaration by the 
parliament in vilnius rejecting the 1940 soviet annexation 
stasys lozoraitis jr charge daffaires of the lithuanian 
legation in washington said at a separate news conference that 
since the western powers have never recognized the soviet 
annexation of lithuania the international law that should be 
applied is that the soviets should withdraw 
a majority of lithuanians are for independence lozoraitis said 
but a referendum would be a trap for neighboring estonia and 
latvia where sizable minorities oppose independence 
all three baltic republics were part of the russian empire from 
the late 18th century until after world war i they were 
independent between the wars but forcibly annexed by the soviet 
union in 1940 after moscow took control of the republics under 
terms of a secret pact with nazi germany 
the baltic republics have continued to maintain legations as 
their diplomatic representatives in washington 
reshetov said the soviet union supports selfdetermination but 
said selfdetermination can take various forms and the creation 
of a new state is the highest form 
in international law it is well established that the means of 
determining the right to selfdetermination is a referendum or 
plebiscite the foreign ministry official said 
asked about the presence of soviet troops in lithuania reshetov 
said the only thing that is happening in this respect in 
lithuania is that law and order should be upheld in this part of 
the soviet union 
lozoraitis however said we can maintain law and order by 
ourselves and dont need the red army to maintain law and order 
the soviet official was also asked about the expulsion of 
western correspondents from lithuania on april 1 and about the 
occupation of a newspaper plant in vilnius by soviet troops on 
march 31 
reshetov replied that the journalists were exluded under 
international law principles that also permit exclusion of foreign 
diplomats he said he hoped it will be just for a limited time 
the official also said that in recent months lithuanian 
newspapers that opposed secession received no newsprint from 
lithuanian factories but newspapers in favor of secession 
received plenty of paper 
lozoraitis denied that there was any policy of denying newsprint 
to papers that opposed independence he said some newspapers were 
not able to get paper because they lacked the financial means

an early morning blaze on board the 
irish sea car ferry norrona killed one man and injured 32 people on 
monday police said and both police and the ships owner said 
arson was suspected 
the ferry was carrying 297 people from milford haven 180 miles 
west of london to rosslare ireland and was eight miles off wales 
when the fire was discovered the blaze damaged 10 cabins 
the b and i shipping line with headquarters in dublin ireland 
issued a statement saying it suspected the norrona fire was started 
deliberately the company said the blaze began in two of norronas 
unoccupied sleeping cabins 
it did not elaborate but the companys marine superintendent 
capt peter mckenna told irish radio the cabins are not 
normally locked but the area was not allocated to passengers for 
this particular sailing the cabins were close to each other in the 
same section 
mckenna said the company believes mattresses or lighted paper 
started the fire 
it followed a suspicious fire on the scandinavia star ferry 
early saturday that killed an estimated 170 people that fire broke 
out while the danishowned ship was traveling from norway to 
denmark with at least 500 aboard 
i am sure the terrible fire on the scandinavian star at the 
weekend was going through a lot of peoples minds suddenly we all 
seemed to be in a similar situation said fred jenkinson a 
norrona passenger 
survivors described crawling through thick smoke that choked 
corridors and cabins 
i took the skin off my knees and toes but thank god we got 
out alive said jenkinson who was asleep in his cabin when he 
heard shouts and smelled smoke 
assistant chief constable eifion pritchard who announced the 
criminal inquiry in the norrona fire said we do not know the 
cause at present but there are grounds for suspecting it may not 
have started accidentally 
pritchard said experts were aboard the vessel and a postmortem 
examination was being carried out on the victim 
b and i said the victim was not a member of the crew 
thirtytwo passengers needed hospital treatment mostly for 
smoke inhalation police said 
company chief executive jim kennedy said we are obviously 
very concerned and are holding our own investigation into the 
way everything was handled 
firefighters and crew controlled the blaze within two hours of 
the captains distress call said coast guard spokesman george 
clarke 
three british military helicopters were used to remove injured 
people and to take firefighters and two doctors to the vessel 
the ferry returned to the dock under its own power 
fire also broke out monday in the engine room of the french 
ferry reine mathilde which was carrying 675 people fron caen 
france to portsmouth england and was extinguished by the crew 
the coast guard said a 66yearold passenger died of a heart 
attack and one crew member was overcome by smoke 
the fire was the third aboard a passenger ship in northern 
european waters since saturday 
tugs were dispatched to pull in the reine mathilde which was 14 
miles off the isle of wight

dan quayle is not the hoosier stumblebum 
that comedians joke about says the vice presidents fan club 
which has launched a letterwriting campaign to enlighten 
latenight entertainers 
members of the hit the trail for quayle club said monday they 
want johnny carson and other prominent comedians to knock off 
knocking quayle and find some other target for their monologues 
they make him out to be some hoosier stumblebum but hes no 
dummy said noel clark of peoria hes really a sharp guy but 
these comedians johnny carson jay leno pat sajak and the 
liberalminded press keep jumping on him 
weve written these comedians and told them to lay off dan 
quayle and clean up their acts 
clark is one of about 30 members of the club founded earlier 
this year by dorothy vallosio of peoria 
we just resent all the jokes bashing our vice president 
mrs vallosio said they are so mean and theyve criticized him 
over and over and over so often that theyve got people believing 
them the public is being programmed to think our vice president is 
a laughingstock 
the groups first letters were directed at television networks 
but they never got a response so the group decided to write 
individual comics 
hes a human being mrs vallosio said of quayle we think 
our officials have to be superhuman but everybody makes mistakes 
charlie barrett a spokesman for nbcs the tonight show 
starring johnny carson which features leno as guest host said 
the fan club is overreacting to harmless comedic barbs 
a lot of people in the public eye are lampooned by the 
media barrett said its meant to entertain no more than 
that 
sajak was out of the country and unavailable to comment 
quayle spokesman david beckwith applauded the clubs efforts and 
suggested carson and the others take note 
they are perpetuating a stereotype that has no real 
correlation with reality beckwith said in a telephone interview 
sometimes that sort of reputation is hard to shake 
if youre doing a good job as vice president as dan quayle 
is youre not going to get a lot of publicity or get on television 
a lot its nice the hit the trail for quayle club is doing 
something about it

officials proposed trimming the size of a 
palestinian parliament from 452 to 400 seats on monday and said the 
islamic hamas movement and a longstanding dissident faction 
expressed interest in joining the council 
members of the nine palestine liberation organization factions 
as well as independent figures made the recommendation after three 
days of talks aimed at convening a meeting this year of the 
palestine national council 
the national council functions as parliament for the palestinian 
state it declared two years ago and sets policy for the plo 
the national council speaker sheikh abdul hamid alsayeh told 
the associated press the cuts would come among representatives of 
palestinian refugees living outside israeliheld territory those 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip would retain their 186 
seats 
the recommendation will go before the plos executive committee 
sayeh said the nine factions would hold the same proportion of 
seats they do now with fatah led by plo chairman yasser arafat 
holding the largest share 
he said the fundamantalist movement hamas or zeal in arabic 
and the marxist popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command are very much interested in joining the 
new council 
hamas has widespread support in the gaza strip and west bank 
where it has sometimes vied with the plo for leadership of the 
28monthold uprising against israeli occupation 
one sticking point might be the november 1988 plo decision to 
renounce terrorism and accept israels right of existence as a step 
toward peace talks with israel aimed at a palestinian state 
alongside the jewish country 
hamas favors struggle to regain all of what is now israel for 
the palestinians 
sayeh said ahmed jibrils syrianbased pflpgc also sought 
council membership 
jibrils relatively small group also has opposed arafats 
efforts to reach peace through compromise 
sayeh said the national council was due to meet in november 
he said independents will continue to be allotted 45 percent of 
the seats 
nominal independents often have been allied with one or another 
of the guerrilla factions

dr louis sullivan the us secretary of health 
said monday that the united states would end up with more addiction 
and more deaths if it ever legalized drugs 
legalization would be a tragic horrible mistake and its 
folly has become so apparent that no one should seriously offer it 
as an alternative he told a plenary session at a drug summit of 
112 nations 
sullivan said there was a very small but vocal minority in 
the united states that opposes the war on drugs 
we must beware of those who argue that ending substance abuse 
requires too much effort time and resources he said some of 
these critics claim that legalization is the answer but as we 
have discovered in the united states it is no answer at all 
despite the us investment of significant resources in drug 
prevention during the 1960s and 1970s he said those two decades 
encouraged pseudolegalization and social tolerance 
in the united states our experience with those two decades 
demonstrated the price we will pay for appeasement more drugs 
more addiction and more death sullivan said 
legalization would remove the stigma from drug use the 
pressure for treatment and the few restraints there are on cost and 
supply he said 
legalization would send the people the message that our 
society is morally indifferent to their use of harmful drugs he 
said 
british prime minister margaret thatcher opening the threeday 
conference also urged delegates to make it absolutely clear that 
you cant beat drugtaking by legalizing drugs 
that is the way to destroy young lives ruin families and 
undermine society itself our task is to protect young people not 
deliberately expose them to danger she said 
i can assure you that our government will never legalize 
illicit drugs hard or soft the prime minister said 
sullivan said the summit sponsored by britain and the united 
nations had a chance to write the final chapter in the horror 
story of the worlds drug epidemic if it fostered an 
international commitment to work together to end the drug crisis 
if this succeeded he said then we have sent the drug 
kingpins and dealers a warning they must heed or face certain doom 
their days are numbered 
we also will be sending a message to users that they bear 
responsibility in perpetuating the drug problem we must 
communicate to users that help is available to them but that they 
must seek it he said

landslide victory in national elections march 2830 the new

units and internal security 
dabengwa former intelligence chief of nkomos zimbabwe african

zimbabwes sweeping state of emergency regulations 
he was released from detention during talks between the two 
rival parties that led to their merger in december 1987 
nkomo has served in mugabes cabinet as a enior minister for

post of a second vice president of equal rank to muzenda and both 
would be assigned duties by his own office

the sensitive post of security minister and nathan shamuyarira

community 
norman was mugabes first agriculture minister after the former 
british colony of rhodesia became independent zimbabwe in 1980 
but norman was fired in 1985 because of continued white support

attitudes among whites removed norman because of it 
in the march elections the ruling party won 116 of the 119

opposition zimbabwe unity movement 
norman has been closely associated with an organization raising 
investment to improve landlocked zimbabwes transport links to the 
sea through neighboring mozambique 
stamps a longtime harare city councilman inherits the health 
ministry which has been accused of inefficiency and mismanagement 
in its awareness campaign to halt the steep increase in the spread

the basis of the alvor accords which in 1975 plotted the course 
for independence from portugal via a powersharing transitional 
government 
the government demanded full recognition of its authority and 
state institutions as part of its latest peace plan but mondays 
concessions could be enough to tempt the government back to the 
negotiating table 
unita pledged in the statement to respect all accords signed 
over the past 15 years by the mpla government once free and fair 
elections were held in angola 
agostinho netos mpla or popular movement for the liberation of 
angola prevailed in the struggle over who would lead angola 
following independence from portugal neto who died in 1979 was 
the first president of independent angola the mpla party now is 
led by netos successor dos santos 
norberto de castro the unita spokesman in lisbon dismissed as 
pure speculation news reports after the sao tome meeting that 
peace talks would start this week in cape verde 
that meeting included presidents dos santos and denis sassou 
nguesso of congo omar bongo of gabon and host manuel pinto da 
costa of sao tome e principe 
while inviting the government to talks in lisbon the rebels 
reaffirmed their support for president mobutu sese seko of zaire 
who first brought the two sides together for an initial truce at 
gbadolite last june 22 
mobutus efforts to broker a lasting peace failed after the 
ceasefire collapsed fighting has intensified recently including 
rebel bombs and sabotage in the angolan capital luanda 
mondays statement said unita was determined to act with more 
aggression in luanda until a truce is sealed 
if there is no peace well hit where it hurts most it said 
the rebels also welcomed the profound discussion of the 
angolan conflict by us secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze at their meeting 
last week in washington 
unita reportedly receives 50 million or more in us military 
aid yearly us officials estimate soviet support to the luanda 
government is much higher

police reached the midship cabins of a 
burnedout ferry monday and found families who died together at the 
heart of the fire the bodies of parents lying over children in a 
desperate attempt to save them 
inspector leif skoglund raised the estimated death toll to 170 
in the suspicious weekend blaze that destroyed the norwegian north 
sea ferry scandinavian star he said one victim in every four may 
have been a child 
it was incredible he said groping for words to describe 
the scene they are so badly burned 
police in oslo norway said the death toll could reach 200 
spokesman arne huuse said the figures were unreliable constantly 
changing and a conclusive count might not be available for days 
we may never find out how many there were because some bodies 
are in such bad shape that not even dental records may help said 
dr tom brokopp leader of the medical rescue team 
in britain police began an arson investigation of a fire on the 
irish sea car ferry norrona that killed one man early monday and 
injured 32 people the norrona was carrying 297 people from milford 
haven wales to rosslare ireland 
fire also broke out monday in the engine room of the french 
ferry reine mathilde 14 miles off the isle of wight and englands 
south coast leaving one passenger dead from a heart attack and a 
crewman suffering from smoke inhalation the passenger 66 was not 
identified 
the blaze aboard the vessel carrying 675 people from caen 
france to portsmouth england was extinguished by the crew the 
coast guard said but the vessel lost power and would be towed 
overnight to portsmouth 
a statement from the norrona owners the b and i shipping line 
of dublin said the fire started in two unoccupied sleeping cabins 
and arson was suspected 
a possible link of the scandinavian star fire to three ferry 
fires last year including one in september that killed two swedes 
was being checked 
fierce heat on the scandinavian star prevented police from 
reaching the midship cabins on the third and fourth decks until 
nearly 24 hours after the blaze was declared extinguished sunday 
previous estimates that 500 passengers and crew were aboard were 
largely guesswork and probably low skoglund said since children 
under 7 travel free and would not be listed there were a lot of 
families on board he said 
the fire started before dawn saturday while the ferry was bound 
from oslo to frederikshavn denmark 
police said 93 bodies were removed from the wreckage by dusk 
monday most were sent to oslo for identification 
most of the victims were norwegians and danes four british 
citizens and an american singer were among those missing and 
presumed dead the american was identified as ruth e rome 27 
part of a sevenmember songanddance troupe from new york city 
the fire also apparently took the life of jens c hagen founder 
of the ships operating company 
things point clearly in the direction of arson said magnar 
aukrust assistant police chief of oslo one survivor has 
explained seeing a person putting fire to inflammable material 
he did not provide details 
when a fire starts at three places at the same time and on 
different decks it must have been set said the ferrys captain 
hugo larsen 
part of the investigation now is to check thoroughly all 
details about previous fires on ferries between norway and 
denmark aukrust told the associated press in oslo 
leila freival the swedish justice minister told reporters in 
lysekil a small port 240 miles from stockholm that a joint nordic 
inquiry commission would convene tuesday in oslo to investigate the 
fire a separate maritime commission is to begin hearings wednesday 
in copenhagen denmark 
criticism was leveled at larsen and his crew most of them 
filipino or portuguese for allegedly being unprepared for an 
emergency 
larsen acknowledged in a radio interview that the crew had not 
undergone a fire drill one was scheduled sunday he said the 
captain denied allegations the fire alarm failed 
the first rescue workers to arrive early saturday told reporters 
none of the crew members including the captain was on board to 
help 
we started searching the boat but then the fire became so 
powerful that we were forced to start fighting the fire said 
svante carlsson it was unbelievably difficult 
no one had ever seen anything like it before said inge 
ingemansson a lysekil fireman it was so hot that the water on 
board started boiling and the water we sprayed just turned to 
steam 
the captain denied that leaving his ship was improper i never 
failed the passengers he told the tt news agency 
it was only when the flames were around the bridge and we 
didnt have a chance to go down to look for more passengers on the 
deck that i gave the order to leave the ship 
on swedish television larsen said his critics should have 
been there themselves they dont know what theyre talking 
about

trombonist louis nelson the last member of 
the original preservation hall bands went to his grave in style 
monday in a traditional jazz funeral echoing through the narrow 
streets of old new orleans 
nelson 87 died thursday 10 days after a hitandrun car 
accident 
he was really the last of the old crop of trombonists said 
harold dejan leader of the olympia brass band which led the 
funeral procession there are plenty of imitators but he was the 
last of the good old crop 
the olympia normally a dozen or so musicians was joined by 
about two dozen others for the funeral among them were visitors 
from australia switzerland and los angeles butch thompson 
nelsons pianist on his last tours to japan came from st paul 
with cornetist charley devore 
about 500 people gathered outside the funeral home and followed 
the band as it walked the edge of the french quarter playing old 
hymns like sweet bye and bye what a friend and precious 
lord take me home 
the entourage turned on bourbon street and wound through 
nelsons neighborhood of faubourg marigny moving slowly down 
narrow streets past bungalows and raised cottages to stop at 
nelsons house 
to the strains of just a closer walk with thee the band 
separated for the hearse to pass and for each musician to touch 
goodbye two trumpets blew taps marking nelsons tour with the 
navy band 
when the tempo lifted for an upbeat version of closer walk 
umbrellas the traditional ornament of a second line that joyous 
street dance after the funeral popped open and the mourners 
started clapping in rhythm 
then abruptly an unexpected shift to a waltz it was after 
the ball one of nelsons favorites a couple of lilting courses 
later the band drew away the bouncing shouting crowd with a 
raucous saints go marching in 
the cortege left by the crowd and the body cut loose from 
earthly friends made its way to the cemetery too far away for the 
crowd to walk 
nelson played many such funerals with many of these musicians 
he worked with dejan when the olympia cut its first album of parade 
music in 1956 
nelson preferred the oldtime sweet music with a sliding 
melodic trombone influenced by the swing era but he could also 
play the rough tailgate style as he did with the kid thomas 
valentine band 
he was with kid thomas when russell first recorded them in 1949 
he and thomas were still together in 1961 when they were one of the 
bands that opened preservation hall dedicated to keeping 
traditional new orleans music alive 
since then nelson played with many bands including george 
lewis kid howard and billie and dede pierce and became an 
international star making periodic tours of europe south america 
and japan 
at the time of his death he was playing two nights a week at 
preservation hall and was leading the louis nelson all stars which 
was booked for a summer tour of japan it would have been his tenth 
to that country 
his last performance was the saturday before his car was hit by 
a woman who ran a red light 
the last night he played he sounded as good as ever said 
jazz historian bill russell

million votes in this nation of 26 million residents asking for the 
conservative government to scrap the tax 
government and opposition members of parliament debating the tax 
managed to agree on one thing parliamentary pages mostly 
university students studying for exams could go home at 8 pm 
that meant legislators had to go get their own water and run 
their own errands while votes on amendments dragged on into the 
night 
passage of the bill would send it to the liberaldominated 
senate which is widely expected to hold another round of hearings 
across canada on the legislation

a summary of developments in the news industry for april 29 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the nations press is too comfortable too 
wellpaid too much part of the establishment for the countrys own 
good the president of the american society of newspaper editors 
told colleagues april 4 
we often think of ourselves as davids fighting the 
establishment but the public sees us more and more as statusquo 
establishment goliaths said loren ghiglione publisher and 
editor of the news of southbridge mass 
he cited a poll showing most people think that news media are 
under the influence of powerful people and organizations 
ghiglione addressing the societys 67th annual meeting 
proposed that editors each adopt an institution that makes us 
uncomfortable a prison a mental institution a noisy 
overcrowded bigcity school an aids hospital ward and try to 
work in that world or at least understand it 
he told of his own experiences removing his glasses his belt 
his watch and his shoes as he was admitted to a number of prisons 
in the past year while taking part in an asne study of prison 
journalism each time he said he vowed not to do it again but 
in an era of lawandorder electricchair politics i know i 
should go back 
while we say we comfort the afflicted and afflict the 
comfortable we need to guard against looking at the world 
increasingly through the eyes of the comfortable ghiglione said 
arguing that newspapermen have lost touch with their readers 
one poll showed that half of newspaper journalists earn over 
40000 a year but only 18 percent of the public does he said 
and many of us live in almost exclusively white middleclass 
worlds and send our children to private or suburban public 
schools 
he argued that the world needs editors who will fight 
another speaker author and prizewinning reporter david 
halberstam told the editors that the demands by owners of 
newspapers and newspaper company stocks for everrising profits are 
putting newspapers in jeopardy 
theres a question of how much water you can bring out of the 
stone halberstam said at what point are you taking out more 
than youre putting in 
i think the threat to us is not from the outside not from the 
government not from television it is from ourselves

in the first survey of its kind homosexual 
members of the staffs of american newspapers said their papers do a 
poor job with news about gays or of concern to them 
the gay journalists said their papers treat them fairly and give 
them opportunities to advance but rarely call on their insights 
into gay lifestyles in the same way black reporters are asked to 
help guide coverage of black issues 
and some newsrooms harbor a palpable undercurrent of bias a 
summary of the findings concludes one respondent commented that 
her colleagues who make snide homophobic comments and jokes are 
the same people who write those sensitive stories and 
editorials 
the survey was made public april 4 at the annual meeting of the 
american society of newspaper editors it was undertaken at the 
request of outgoing asne president loren ghiglione who asked 
whether antigay discrimination infects todays newsrooms 
when word of the survey circulated 205 homosexual members of 
the staffs of us newspapers volunteered to respond threefifths 
said they were openly gay and twothirds signed their 
questionnaires 
ninetytwo percent said they knew other people on the staff who 
were gay and the majority of them estimated that fewer than 20 
percent of the homosexuals on their papers were openly gay 
many experts estimate that one american in 10 is gay 
why does it matter asked leroy f aarons an executive of 
the tribune of oakland calif who coordinated the project he 
said the subject is important because more than ever before 
editors are grappling with a swirl of social and political currents 
around alternative lifestyle issues 
domestic partners legislation gay adoption 
antidiscrimination laws fundamentalist attacks on the gay 
lifestyle morality and public responsibility and of course the 
stillraging aids epidemic have brought onceeasily ignored issues 
into demanding focus he said 
the respondents gave especially low ratings to the way their 
papers treated gay lifestyles community events and politics and 
only slightly better ratings to treatment of violence against gays 
civil rights issues and legislation 
as for terminology nearly a third said they found the term 
homosexual to be prejudiced explaining that it refers narrowly 
to sex whereas the term gay refers to lifestyles or issues 
aarons ended his report to the editors by publicly revealing his 
own sexual orientation 
i a paragraph scribbled at the end of his typewritten text and 
read hurriedly in a choked voice he said 
i want you to know that the doing of this report has had 
tremendous impact on gay and lesbian journalists across the nation 
it has given them hope and new optimism it has enhanced their 
respect for this organization i as an editor and a gay man am 
proud of asne

the us court of appeals says it agrees with 
a lower court that the seven bell operating companies cannot enter 
the longdistance or telephone equipment businesses 
but the april 3 ruling reopens the possibility that the 
socalled baby bells can sell electronic information services to 
homes and offices a prospect opposed by newspaper groups 
the decision means that us district judge harold greene must 
consider anew whether the bell companies may be allowed to develop 
socalled electronic yellow pages allowing consumers to shop 
and bank among other possibilities via cheap easytouse video 
terminals 
a prototype governmentoperated system in france called minitel 
already serves 5 million homes and offices and offers 8000 
different services 
the threejudge appeals panel found that greene ruled correctly 
when in his 1987 triennial review of the american telephone amp 
telegraph co antitrust settlement he sustained the original order 
barring the seven spinoff companies from competing with their 
onetime parent in the longdistance and telephone manufacturing 
arenas 
but appeals judges abner mikva harry edwards and laurence 
silberman faulted greenes legal reasoning when as part of that 
same review he only partly opened the door for the operating 
companies to expand into computerbased information services 
greene allowed the bell companies to offer computer gateways and 
access menus for databases and services offered by other companies 
but not to generate those services themselves that precluded 
them from pursuing a us version of minitel

despite warnings that it violates the 
us constitutions first amendment a florida house panel april 4 
narrowly approved a bill requiring newspaper editorial board 
members to publicly disclose their finances 
the bill sponsored by rep bruce mcewan rorlando would also 
make it a seconddegree misdemeanor for a newspaper to publish any 
editorial unless it is signed by the author 
a subcommittee of the house judiciary committee approved the 
measure on a 43 vote it would include editorial board members in 
a present law requiring state employees to file financial 
disclosure forms by july 1 every year or face a possible 5000 
fine 
one of the 32 cosponsors of the bill rep elvin martinez 
dtampa said the measure is not a vendetta against newspapers but 
rather an attempt to shed more light on their role as public 
opinion leaders 
the real molder of public opinion is the press martinez 
said they can take you and beat you and do anything to you and 
theyre immune i think people have a right to know if their views 
are jaundiced by some financial interest 
barry richard attorney for the florida press association said 
the measure clearly infringes on the first amendments guarantee of 
a free press and would never stand up in court 
the only justification for it is that the person 
editorialist makes public comment he said are we next going 
to include the league of womens voters and other groups in this 
category 
mcewan said his intention is not to violate the first amendment 
theres nothing in this bill to prohibit freedom of the 
press he said 
rep john cosgrove dmiami and chairman of the court systems 
probate and consumer law subcommittee said some lawmakers 
supported the bill simply to take a stab at the press 
as much as i might want to get in there and make a little jab 
at editorial boards i think the greater freedom of expression is 
more important cosgrove said 
the legislation next moves to the full house judiciary 
committee which did not immediately set a date to consider it 
mcewan said he was optimistic of approval 
richard was not so sure 
its pressbashing he said it depends on how many people 
are willing to put their names on something thats blatantly 
unconstitutional

the san jose mercury news on march 29 
filed a lawsuit against the former chief of the san jose hotel 
workers union claiming his 1983 libel lawsuit against the 
newspaper was a violation of free press rights 
the newspaper claimed the lawsuit filed by frank marolda damaged 
its reputation and is asking for 1 million in damages and recovery 
of a significant amount for legal fees 
its a combination of abuse of the process and malicious 
prosecution said edward davis attorney for the newspaper the 
unions lawsuit was designed to send out a message to everyone else 
that if you write a negative story about the union youre going to 
be in trouble 
in late 1987 a santa clara county judge threw out maroldas 
lawsuit against the paper and two of its reporters 
marolda then president of a hotel and restaurant employees and 
bartenders union local in san jose and the union objected to an 
article that appeared oct 24 1982 
the story described maroldas administration of the union and 
his problems connected to a us senate investigation of labor 
corruption 
the newspapers suit alleges that marolda and the union 
brought the action for the purpose of harassing annoying 
embarrassing and otherwise oppressing the mercury news

a newspaper company can depreciate paid 
subscriber lists acquired through the purchase of other publishing 
interests a federal judged ruled april 3 
the ruling paves the way for the newhouse familyowned morning 
ledger co of newark to depreciate 71 million on amended tax 
returns said donald a robinson the newark attorney who 
represented the newhouse family 
robinson said the company also will collect an undetermined 
amount of interest from the internal revenue service on the 
previously disallowed depreciation deductions 
the newark morning ledger co owner of the starledger of 
newark sued the irs after the agency refused to let the company 
depreciate subscriber lists for eight michigan papers it acquired 
in 1977 depreciating the lists would decrease the companys 
taxable income 
during the hearing morning ledger attorneys argued that 
subscriber lists should be treated like tangible and hence 
depreciable assets because they are used in the taxpayers 
business for a limited period of time 
us district judge h lee sarokin agreed with the plaintiffs 
that paid subscriber lists are of limited value because subscribers 
die move and cancel subscriptions 
sarokin found that even if the circulation of a newspaper 
remains constant the publisher spends a substantial amount of time 
and money in advertising and subscription drives to replace lost 
customers 
the government argued that subscriber lists are an intangible 
asset that cannot be separated from the companys goodwill 
if the company were given the depreciation allowance any 
business with paying customers could claim depreciation by saying 
the customers have a limited useful life gregory hrebiniak a 
lawyer with the justice departments tax division argued 
the morning ledger company acquired booth newspapers inc of 
ann arbor mich in 1977 the group was worth about 314 million 
and had a combined circulation of 460000 according to the legal 
opinion 
booths eight newspapers in michigan were the ann arbor news 
the bay city times the flint journal the grand rapids press 
jackson citizen patriot kalamazoo gazette the muskegon chronicle

the editor of the dallas times herald said april 
6 his counterpart at the rival dallas morning news stalked for 
years the features that have become the center of a 33 million 
antitrust suit 
the features were extremely important but it was the act 
itself that was deplorable times herald editor roy bode said of 
a features grab by the morning news and its editor burl 
osborne 
bodes remarks drew immediate objections from morning news 
attorneys osborne denied the characterization 
i have no recollection of ever aggressively pursuing their 
package he said during testimony as a hostile witness called by 
times herald attorneys 
the times herald is seeking the 33 million and unspecified 
punitive damages from the morning news and parent company ah belo 
corp 
a joint venture between belo and universal press syndicate inc 
left the times herald without comics and columns that included dear 
abby erma bombeck and doonesbury all distributed by kansas 
citybased ups 
belo and universal press announced their venture universal 
belo to develop syndicate features for television use osborne 
said the shift of the entire ups package to his newspaper was a 
condition required by the syndicate 
the times herald alleges the venture and the transfer of the 
features violated antitrust laws and was an attempt to create a 
monopoly and drive the times herald out of business 
the trial began april 2 and is expected to last at least a month

a judge on april 2 ruled that attorney 
general john van de kamp may use san francisco chronicle articles 
in a tv commercial for his gubernatorial campaign despite the 
papers objection that such use implied an endorsement 
us district judge john vukasin denied a chronicle request to 
bar use of the newspapers name in the commercial 
i suspect it the ad comes dangerously close to creating a 
false impression that that is the chronicle speaking vukasin 
said 
but he said the van de kamp campaign properly identified itself 
as the sponsor of the commercial and was clearly quoting the 
chronicle as a source of information 
neil shapiro a lawyer for the chronicle said the newspaper 
still may sue for damages 
the ad attacks former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein van 
de kamps rival for the democratic nomination over her management 
of the city each subject is illustrated by a chronicle clipping 
about a controversy the papers name appears several times at the 
bottom of the screen 
the chronicle sued to stop the use of its name and masthead 
saying the ad violated the newspapers trademark and was meant to 
mislead 
if we wish to endorse someone we will but we dont want 
somebody stealing the endorsement shapiro told the judge 
saying some angry readers had telephoned the paper to complain 
about its apparent endorsement the lawyer declared that the ad 
confuses people into believing the chronicle supports endorses 
or even prepared it 
but kantor said van de kamp had an obligation as well as a 
constitutional right to quote the chronicle as the source of 
material in his commercial

protest management contract proposals 
the byline strike which began april 2 was organized by the 
newspaper guild which represents about 500 reuters employees 
around the country including 150 journalists their contract 
expired feb 28 
we hope this action will impress management with our anger 
that a company making so much money wants to severely cut the 
benefits and pay of those who are crucial to reuters success 
said barry lipton president of the guild local 
lipton said the companys offer of a 25 percent raise would be 
offset by a proposed weekly increase of work time from 3375 hours 
to 375 hours with no overtime until after 40 hours 
the company has also proposed having employees pay for part of 
the cost of health insurance 
reuters in a statement cited the rising cost of health care 
and said the companys benefits will remain competitive by all 
industry standards

this is not a great age of correspondence says 
the recently retired editor of the times venerable letters column 
though the mailbags still bulge with opinions both profound and 
eccentric 
there are many people who simply do not know how to put words 
onto paper they have to become so used to talking on the telephone 
or dictating into machines and having them tidied up by their 
secretaries leon pilpel said in an interview published april 4 
by the times 
of the 300 letters a day only about 8 percent are 
publishable i am not talking about matters of syntax but about 
importance or fitness 
many of them are pretty mundane although frequently half a 
dozen not very brilliant ones can be made into a very good 
correspondence indeed with a bit of judicious editing and the 
specific approval of the letterwriter 
great debates have been waged in the sober letters columns of 
the times leavened with whimsical bits of english life such as 
the sighting of the first cuckoo of spring 
pilpel who is taking up new duties as a deputy ombudsman at the 
paper joined the times 40 years ago and became letters editor in

a representative of paul mccartney was angered by 
a column in the arizona republic critical of the musicians work 
and ordered the newspaper banned from an april 4 news conference 
and concert 
the republics writers were able to cover the concert because 
the paper had purchased tickets for the soldout performance at 
arizona state university but the ban meant the newspaper was 
unable to photograph either the evening concert or a news 
conference before it the newspaper obtained photographs of the 
concert from the associated press 
republic staff member dennis love whod written the column was 
barred from entering the news conference by geoff baker 
mccartneys tour publicist 
the republic said it did not know whether mccartney approved or 
even knew of the ban 
dennis loves column was merely an effort to provide the 
diversity of opinion that is in the best tradition of good 
journalism said robert franken a republic assistant managing 
editor weve provided a lot of positive publicity about this 
concert including an entire section last month and were frankly 
surprised that one writers personal opinion would be reason to 
exclude all republic coverage we dont see how that helps anyone 
loves column published april 3 questioned mccartneys talents 
and abilities since the beatles breakup contended that his 
postbeatles music is schlock and added that it is possible he

about 100 pickets marched in front of the 
philadelphia daily news on april 4 to protest what they they called 
racism on the part of the newspaper and negative coverage of the 
black community 
the papers editor denied the claims pointing to the daily 
news record of minority hiring and support for the community 
the marchers including city councilman lucien e blackwell a 
likely candidate for mayor in 1991 asked blacks to cease buying 
the newspaper 
they said the newspaper overemphasizes crime news involving 
black people presents a distorted picture of blacks in the city 
ignores positive news involving blacks and is overly aggressive 
and racially motivated in covering black officials 
were not trying to shut it down said attorney charles 
bowser who led the march were not trying to change the paper 
we just want to get africanamericans to stop buying it if they 
can sell it to other people and keep going fine 
daily news editor zachary stalberg denied the charges 
i reject completely the idea of the daily news as racist and 
i particularly object to the notion that our political or 
government coverage is biased in any way stalberg said 
in a note to readers stalberg said the daily news has attracted 
the largest minority audience of any big city paper in the nation 
he also noted the papers record in hiring and promotion and its 
1988 endorsement of the rev jesse jackson for president 
the news has made some blood enemies that is because it is 
visceral and twofisted and enjoys feasting on phonies and bungling 
politicians stalberg wrote

state his case but failed to take advantage of it

the coining of such terms as moo u and the iowa hip disease

unless a male student has a sick desire for farm women who are

restaurateur by any spelling whether

language according to a survey released april 3 
but if they have to use the word for keeper of a restaurant 
theyll take it without the n said respondents to the 12th 
englishlanguage usage survey by the indiana university school of 
journalism 
many in the survey found it stuffy no matter how it is 
spelled though its use is patently expanding in this country 
wrote professor richard l tobin 
the 10question survey was mailed to 100 newspaper copy editors 
and 50 magazine editors in the united states and canada and got a 
60 percent return tobin said 
the consensus throughout this years survey was mighty close 
to unanimous in almost every example which just goes to show that 
copyreaders know what theyre doing and do it like the sterling 
languageusage guardians they are put there to be the survey 
said 
nearly all editors agree percent should be one word and not 
two 
most editors agreed the region deep south should be uppercase 
most copy desks caught the misuse of tremblor instead of 
temblor in a line from a maryland newspaper reporting a palm 
springs earthquake 
most changed forego to forgo in the sentence the 
university decided to forego the traditional faculty banquet 
because of the financial situation 
copy desks were asked whether gibe or jibe was correct 
in the following sentence three suspects were taken to police 
headquarters but detectives announced later that their stories 
didnt gibe the verdict was almost unanimous that jibe was 
correct 
complacent was correctly preferred over complaisant in 
an item saying a soccer team had become complaisant after four 
straight victories

small investors and the media could face higher 
costs for their daily diet of stock prices under a proposal by the 
nations stock exchanges that could lead to new fees for market 
data 
a group of news organizations discount stock brokerages and 
database services is challenging the request for a contractual 
change that could open the door to charges on 15minuteold stock 
quotes 
delayed last sale information as it is called is now free to 
vendors except for transmission costs charges are applied only to 
realtime quotes which are uptothesecond prices individual 
investors pay about 13 a month for realtime quotations from the 
new york stock exchange institutions can pay up to 120 a month 
the stock exchanges say they own the data real or delayed and 
need to recover the costs of compiling and distributing it 
opponents of the proposal by the nyse and seven other exchanges 
pending before the securities and exchange commission said april 6 
that delayedprice fees would drive investors who cant afford to 
pay for realtime data from the markets they said the 
15minuteold numbers are public property 
its like charging for the wrapper on the candy after its 
been eaten said hugo quackenbush spokesman for discount broker 
charles schwab amp co 
but thomas haley the nyses vice president for market data 
said the exchanges already have the right to charge for delayed 
data and to alter the definition of delayed data 
haley said charging some users for stockprice quotations and 
giving it away free to others is unfair and should be reconsidered 
the exchange and the cta receives nothing zero from those 
organizations for the use of that data he said that operation 
is being subsidized by all the others who are paying 
with the development of lightningquick transmission capability 
and competing computer databases in the last decade more and more 
businesses are using the stock exchanges free data 
haley said the nyse has 134 contracts to provide delayed data to 
vendors who in turn make it available to an estimated 15 million 
personal users he said about 200000 display units have access to 
realtime data 
the associated press is one of a dozen groups that have objected 
to the exchanges proposal in addition to schwab and quick amp

the constitution clearly limits government and thats how it 
should be said the fcc chairman who once operated a missouri

there was a time when the british band 
marillion performed poetic tales of midlife crisis tragic love 
affairs politics and alcoholism that bordered on the negative 
but these days with a new optimism and a new lead singer the 
group sings of strife in northern ireland in the elegant track 
easter of love gone obsessive in the uninvited guest and 
of global warming in the title track of seasons end their new 
lp 
im trying to deal with all of those things on a soul level 
on a humanity level rather than trying to make some kind of 
political point said steve hogarth who replaced the 
introspective derek dick who was called fish as vocalist and 
lyricist 
i think its a great romantic notion to turn all the poets 
into politicians he said i dont think its our place or 
musicians place to stand up and propose solutions other than to 
propose hope and to propose the wider and more common sense things 
like love and peace 
that attitude carries over in marillions live performances 
hogarth is engaging on stage leaping on to speaker cabinets to 
sing and making frequent eye contact with his audience 
i try to be a bit friendly he said i try and love them 
i know that sounds like an insincere american sort of thing to say 
but i do try in all sincerity to love them while im singing to 
them i think that youve got to put something out to people to get 
something back from them that is genuine 
though popular in england for about a decade marillion is just 
beginning to gain an audience in the united states 
the group started in 1978 as silmarillion a name taken from the 
jrr tolkein novel their leader was the enigmatic fish others 
in the band were guitarist steve rothery bassist pete trewavas 
keyboardist mark kelly and drummer ian mosley 
they released their first album script for a jesters tear 
in 1983 under their new name marillion 
through 1988 marillion released six albums their most notable 
efforts with fish were the brilliant concept works misplaced 
childhood released in 1985 and clutching at straws in 1987 
fish left the band in 1988 and was replaced in 1989 by hogarth 
who had been in several lesser bands around britain fish has just 
released a solo album vigil in a wilderness of mirrors which 
is already in the top 10 in britain 
hogarth was familiar with the bands material before he joined 
but didnt know the group was looking for a new singer until his 
publisher told him 
id never seen the band play and i wasnt a member of the fan 
club or anything so i didnt understand the band in terms of how 
they actually are as people hogarth said in a telephone 
interview following a concert stop in philadelphia 
but the connection between hogarth and the rest of marillion was 
immediate 
they all knew straight off that it was right they dont know 
why i think they just got the feeling that i was coming from the 
same planet in terms of what stimulated me hogarth said 
the band had been looking for someone whos just going to be 
himself he said and they were more than willing to use music he 
had written 
i think thats why spiritually the band feels so new 
hogarth said because it has been a natural process we havent 
taken anything that was old and tried to chisel away at whats new 
in order to make it fit 
however fishs departure was a strain on both sides hogarth 
said 
the band were beginning to have a problem with the stuff fish 
was writing as well as fish was beginning to have a problem with 
wanting to work with the band hogarth said 
the problem the band were having with his writing was that he 
was beginning to be so introverted that the band were beginning to 
worry that nobody else in the world was ever going to relate to 
what he was going on about 
hogarth said it was a happier band that recorded seasons end 
we had a great time writing the album and then a great time 
recording it because we coproduced it hogarth said we didnt 
have anyone telling us what to do when we were recording the album 
so the spirit right from day one has been extremely positive and i 
think its reflected not only in the album but in the spirit on 
stage and the live shows as well 
hogarth thinks the band can make it in the united states but 
will have to do it through touring because nobodys ever go records to 
death on daytime rading to 
play ourio thats not the kind of 
band we are and in a way thats our strength 
but in a way the singer appreciates the bands anonymity 
were in the fortunate position that our record company hasnt 
the foggiest idea why our fans love it and so they leave us to 
just get on with it he said

thirtyfive robot arms hold the main parts of 
a nissan sentra body in virtually perfect alignment and 16 others 
weld the parts together in 62 spots 
then 45 seconds later everything changes the fourdoor sedan 
body moves on a computer automatically readjusts the bank of 
robots to assemble the next item on the line a hatchback 
after the computer does its work again the robots assemble the 
body of a station wagon 
down the line each body will be painted a different color and 
receive different parts all determined by computer command 
japanese companies are increasing the flexibility of production 
lines to handle a mix of models and options and permit easy 
changeover to new designs 
in selling his model t the worlds first massproduced car 
henry ford offered any color you want as long as its black 
japanese companies in contrast are using computerization to focus 
on miniproduction that offers specialized lowvolume models 
and even custom jobs 
toyota makes supra lexus and soarer models on the same line in 
its tahara plant honda produces accords and integras on a single 
line at suzuka 
each car at the tahara factory carries a specially programmed 
identification disk it emits radio signals picked up by receivers 
at each work station which tell a robot or worker what kind of 
battery shock absorber or stereo system to install 
nissan said the new intelligent body assembly system at the 
zama plant was the first in the world to use computerprogrammable 
robots instead of fixed jigs in aligning the main body parts 
including floor roof and side panels 
that allows one assembly line to handle up to four different 
models and eight body types at once the positioning operations 
for different models have been the most difficult aspects of body 
assembly work to automate a company statement said 
officials at nissan said the system greatly reduces the time and 
cost of model changes 
lengthy and expensive retooling of jigs and production machines 
for model changes result in long down times for production 
lines 
with programmable robots many changes can be made by modifying 
the computer program that can be combined with the design process 
with this system we can take the computer program to another 
plant and begin production in three months said kazutake 
kobatake a nissan spokesman before it took 1011 months to 
transfer production 
the system will cut retooling costs for a new model in half he 
said 
zamas no 2 assembly line is one of the most highly automated 
in japan with 97 percent of the 30004000 welds per car done by 
robot said tsuneyuki hane general manager of the plant 
use of computerized production technology allows companies to 
send a computer program rather than bulky new jigs and equipment 
to an overseas plant to shift production to new or popular models 
it also helps avoid excess inventory by tailoring each days 
production mix to demand 
such flexibility allows nissan to produce several lowvolume 
specialty models for the japanese market 
the system now used in nissans plants at zama and tochigi 
will be introduced at two other japanese plants and the us 
factory in smyrna tenn company officials said 
other industries also are increasing the flexibility of 
production lines 
matsushita electric industrial co maker of panasonic bicycles 
allows people to customorder from 18 models and 199 paint jobs 
specifying size and choosing pedals tires and logo 
were able to make a bicycle which fits the customer precisely 
and deliver it within two weeks a matsushita official said 
he said the customorder system adds about 4595 to the cost 
of a bicycle it accounts for only about 15000 of the 700000 
bicycles the company sells each year but is growing and has spread 
to other companies the official said 
analysts say the united states trails in flexible assembly line 
technology and that large american companies have displayed less 
interest in specialized lowvolume production

it took a world premiere in britain for playwright 
sally nemeth to get some attention at home in new york now she 
says agents answer her calls 
london has always loved american dramatists not just greats 
such as tennessee williams and eugene oneill but the upandcoming 
too as nemeth has discovered 
john logan is virtually unheard of in the united states except 
in his home city chicago but his 1983 play never the sinner 
is running on londons west end with an impressive cast headed by 
joss ackland and julian glover 
richard nelsons offbroadway play some americans abroad 
was first produced by the royal shakespeare company last summer 
the american dramatists second commission for the british company 
opens in stratforduponavon in the autumn 
one reason american playwrights can make it in britain is that 
production costs are much lower here than in new york another is 
that critical pressures are less acute london fields an array of 
equally influential reviewers it isnt just a onecritic town such 
as new york where a nod from frank rich of the new york times can 
make or break a production 
some dramatists feel their work strikes more sympathetic chords 
abroad 
its hard to go out on a stylistic limb in the states 
although i think that is changing said nemeth 30 whose rather 
parched opaque writing style is at odds with much american drama 
her new play mill fire about an explosion at an alabama steel 
mill opened to mixed reviews march 16 at west londons riverside 
studios 
i think my plays are somewhat hard to read in that theyre 
very spare it takes someone who can really read that kind of work 
to respond to it she said 
nemeth has found that someone in director brian stirner the 
briton who staged her two london plays 
richard nelsons oblique ironic tone seems more attuned to 
contemporary british writers than to his american peers 
the reaction here has been much more generous much more 
understanding said nelson 39 who has had two plays performed 
by the rsc some americans abroad and principia scriptoriae 
both got better reviews in london than in new york some 
americans abroad received an olivier award nomination as the 
years best comedy in london says nelson his plays have been 
critically perceived and understood and argued about 
only recently has he hit problems in midmarch he quit as book 
writer of king the troubled london musical about the rev 
martin luther king jr 
john logan says his never the sinner shows an interest in 
history less evident in american playwriting in the american 
theater he charges we have forgotten our history weve 
betrayed it 
he said he did not want to write the kind of personal play that 
proliferates in the united states 
i have very little regard for anemic tv theater for 
naturalistic selfindulgent sometimes autobiographical drama 
he said four of logans five favorite dramatists are british 
steven berkoff howard brenton caryl churchill and harold pinter 
another chicago writer aaron iverson wrote a play in 1982 only 
to find it being premiered professionally in london last month 
id had readings of the play done in chicago but no one 
expressed a whole lot of interest said iverson 32 
instead his side pockets ended its monthlong debut march 3 
at the theater royal stratford east iverson has been commissioned 
to write a second play for the theater 
he said the playhouse in a bluecollar ethnically mixed area 
reached a public more difficult to attract in the united states 
there he said the audience i want only watches tv and movies 
iverson who earns his living as a lawyer says i kind of 
feel like workingclass or poor people arent really addressed 
much 
nemeth has had many offers from american agents in the wake of 
london productions of her two plays but producers so far havent 
been forthcoming logan continues to work regularly in chicago 
where he currently has a commission from the goodman theater but 
he has yet to have a major staging of any of his plays in new york 
while none of the writers sees broadway as a goal few are ready 
to renounce the united states altogether and move to london as 
playwright martin sherman when she danced bent did over 
a decade ago 
said nelson i love my country im american i love living in 
america

it was only a joke but one with a message 
when secretary of defense richard b cheney heard the berlin wall 
had been torn down he wanted it rebuilt 
he said it was the only thing standing between us and the 
russians speaker of the house thomas s foley kidded cheney at a 
formal dinner 10 days ago 
cheney is the administrations ranking budget hawk these days 
hes being needled and challenged on all fronts he makes a 
logical tightlyreasoned case for a slow and cautious reduction in 
defense spending but the pressure is intense to cut more faster 
the cutback case is made with matching logic and with the 
advantage of representing change in a time of dramatic world change 
the minute dick cheney walked through the pentagon door he 
ordered all the clocks set back 10 years joked foley a friend 
and a house colleague before cheney joined the cabinet 
no matter what youve heard im not a relic of the cold war 
cheney joked back but somebody in this town has to 
worry about what were going to do when stalin dies 
there are serious numbers behind all that beginning with the 
295 billion defense budget the administration seeks for the year 
beginning next oct 1 thats more dollars than this year but it 
represents a 26 percent reduction in inflationadjusted spending 
cheney recommends 2 percent cuts in each of the following four 
budget years 
democratic leaders and now two republican members of the senate 
armed services committee say those reductions dont go deep 
enough sens william s cohen of maine and john mccain of arizona 
said thursday that the defense budget can be cut by twice as much 
as the administration is proposing to save at least 50 billion 
more over the next five years 
foley said their proposal will not preempt democratic demands 
for sharper defense budget cuts he said it shows the 
administration does not have wide support for the spending levels 
cheney is advocating 
the administration is really quite isolated in this the 
speaker said friday 
cheney has been arguing his side of the case in congressional 
testimony speeches and pentagon statements he put it all together 
in an address to the american society of newspaper editors last 
wednesday saying that the administration has moved 
aggressively to change defense proposals so as to fit changing 
times 
but as secretary of defense i have to focus on soviet 
capabilities he said intentions can change overnight 
capabilities take much longer to alter 
cheney said those capabilities include the worlds largest 
standing army and a strategic nuclear force even now being 
modernized 
so he said the administration is proceeding cautiously and 
prudently with a fiveyear defense plan that would cut spending by 
some 231 billion putting the defense share of the budget and the 
gross national product at the lowest levels since before world war 
ii 
even in the best of international circumstances cheney said if 
the united states is to remain a leading world power it must 
maintain offensive and defensive strategic forces a system of 
military alliances troops deployed abroad fewer in number but 
still there naval superiority flexible forces to react to varying 
contingencies and an industrial base to produce hightechnology 
weapons 
cheney said people who talk about cutting defense spending by 
half over the next 10 years would give us the defense budget of a 
secondclass power the budget of an america in decline 
far from becoming less of a force in the world america is 
going to be taking on greater global responsibilities in the years 
ahead cheney said no other nation will be capable of our kind 
of global reach 
security threats were not invented by the communist party of 
the soviet union and threats will remain long after that partys 
gone out of business he said as a result the world will 
still be a dangerous place a place that will continue to benefit 
from and indeed require the stabilizing influence of the 
american military 
that in brief is the case advanced by the administrations 
point man on the defense budget the counter arguments are being 
sounded in congress the battle over defense spending is just 
beginning

valerie bertinelli spent five years looking 
for a new television series until she was sold on becoming 
sydney a role she says emphasizes hidden elements of her own 
personality 
the new cbs comedy in which she plays a young and single 
private detective is her first series since one day at a time 
bertinelli literally grew up on one day at a time as one of 
the daughters of bonnie franklin she began when she was 15 and was 
24 when the show ended in 1984 
i was never allowed to go this far with barbara cooper on one 
day at a time she says of her character on sydney which 
airs wednesdays i couldnt yell at people and make it funny 
sydney yells at everybody when she doesnt get her way she puts 
her foot down and says this is the way its going to be 
ive been looking for a new series ever since the old one went 
off she said ive been looking and looking my manager and 
partner jack grossbart and i must have gone through a hundred 
ideas then michael wilson came along with sydney and it clicked 
for me i want it to stay on a long time 
the show was created by wilson who also is a coexecutive 
producer 
id heard so many ideas and they all sounded alike 
bertinelli said i dont know if it was the idea or michael 
himself i really really liked him i liked his energy and the way 
his mind worked so fast i knew i wanted to work with him 
bertinelli plays sydney kells the daughter of a policeman now 
dead and sister of a rookie policeman played by matthew perry she 
does most of her detective work for a conservative lawyer played by 
craig bierko and drives him crazy she hangs out at a neighborhood 
bar run by barney martin her fathers old police partner rebeccah 
bush is her best friend perry anzilotti is her snitch and daniel 
baldwin is the barroom pest 
i keep wanting to say sydney is like part of me she said 
but it all goes back to michael its like the part of me ive 
never allowed anyone to see shes gregarious shes smart 
intuitive and naive in a way lets say shes naively jaded 
the stories involve both her cases and her personal life 
sometimes theyre mixed in one episode her best friend is 
kidnapped and she has to find her 
the show got good reviews but is doing only soso in the 
ratings and will have to improve to run beyond its first 13 
episodes it faces two popular wednesday shows abcs head of the 
class and nbcs unsolved mysteries cbs hopes to boost the 
ratings with a special appearance by pat harrington bertinellis 
costar on one day at a time the episode in which harrington 
also plays a private eye will be broadcast as a special on monday 
april 23 in the time slot now occupied by city 
the shows theme music is finish what ya started from the 
latest album by bertinellis husband rock guitarist eddie van 
halen a member of the group van halen 
i begged ed to let me use it she said 
the first part of the name of her production company oomp amp 
friends is a little personal thing between ed and me 
bertinelli said let people try to figure it out she added 
after one day at a time bertinelli starred in the 
miniseries ill take manhattan and 11 tv movies 
she last was seen in october in the movie taken away in 
which she played a single mother falsely accused of child abuse

an old maxim that it is stocks rather than the 
stock market that should matter to individual investors is getting 
a workout on wall street these days it is written in the averages 
in the years first quarter the dow jones industrial average 
made up of very large and mostly very bluechip companies slipped 
only 50 points or so which works out to a drop of 17 percent 
the standard amp poors 500stock average which includes a good 
many relatively smaller companies fell more sharply about 38 
percent or more than double the descent rate of the dj average 
the even broader value line composite index whose 1700 members 
include an even bigger mix of smaller companies fell 58 percent 
leaving it about 15 percent lower than in the summer of 1987 
the verdict many stocks especially smaller stocks are down a 
great deal more than is indicated by the dj average without 
question the most widely used numerical indicator of market 
strength 
smaller stocks have been hit hard for several years now wright 
investors service points out that in 23 of the past 27 quarters 
small stocks have lagged behind the bigger brandname companies 
that dominate most indicators 
it is a rare situation and one that tends to confuse a lot of 
people and even some analysts 
has the stock market for example already had its correction 
disquised from popular view by a rather slight decline in the dj 
average is the correction yet to come is the direction of the 
market up or down 
the confusion might be greatest of course for those who judge 
the market by the averages instead of the prices of individual 
stocks or groups of stocks because the current market is an 
unusual mix 
utility stocks which had risen sharply late in 1989 were big 
losers in the first quarter of this year falling 68 percent 
financial stocks fell more than 7 percent in both the final quarter 
of 1989 and the first of 1990 
in fact only four of 25 industry groups advanced in the first 
quarter and three of them construction metal production and 
electronics showed gains not so much because of strength but 
because they had fallen earlier 
such figures drive home the point made by so many investment 
advisers that popular averages hardly tell the full story or even 
a realistic one that people invest in individual stocks rather 
than in the market and that they must watch stock prices rather 
than stock market averages 
todays stock market also recalls a kernel of advice underlying 
a good many conservative investment philosophies that within any 
industry even those performing poorly you may find companies that 
defy the generality 
the lesson it seems is that the forest isnt just a mass of 
trees but an assembly of individual trees and the stock market 
isnt a unit in itself but one made up of thousands of separate 
companies each distinct in its own way

more than 300000 people have asked the federal prosecutors 
office for copies of file cards summarizing dossiers the police may 
have on them just answering the letters will take at least until 
the end of 1990 
the government also is under pressure to release the full 
dossiers on which the file cards are based officials say that 
would take many more months 
fewer than 30000 people have received information to date 
published excerpts of schaffroths and other files indicate 
surveillance focused on contacts with leftist circles and travels 
to communist countries but was not limited to them 
even a taste for beer or watching street theater was recorded a 
car parked near an antinuclear rally could inspire an entry in the 
owners dossier 
these methods are unworthy of our democracy schaffroth 69 
told the associated press i feel angry and concerned 
koller characterized the methods as unacceptable and 
amateurish but said the surveillance began during the cold war 
and was similar to that in other countries 
snooping state has become a widely used reference in the 
swiss press but the strongest reactions have come from regular 
critics of the establishment 
artists and writers have said they may refuse to help prepare 
for next years celebrations there have been calls for a boycott 
of a national census planned in december 
what made us deserve a state which is so unsure of itself that 
its concern for security becomes paranoid adolf muschg a 
wellknown novelist asked at a protest rally last month in bern 
he said the federal police had turned switzerland into a 
banana republic 
disclosures of other secret files in the justice and defense 
ministries have added to the clamor they include lists of 
suspects to be interned or restricted in case of war or 
political emergency 
particularly startling was the discovery in the justice ministry 
of data on thousands of foreign children who vacationed in 
switzerland in the early years after world war ii under a red cross 
charity program 
hubert bucher secretarygeneral of the swiss red cross said 
the records were turned over to the government for lack of space 
he denied suggestions that the red cross offered them for possible 
use by swiss counterintelligence 
a storm of mistrust is sweeping the country defense 
minister kaspar villiger told a congress of his conservative 
radical democratic party last month 
an editorial in the influential conservative newspaper neue 
zuercher zeitung spoke of the brutal disillusionment of 
citizens 
the independent basler zeitung said the files reflect the 
reverse side of our national character this proverbial tidiness 
this efficiency this zeal once unleashed can turn into 
unscrupulous fulfillment of duty which evidently may eliminate 
intelligence as well as conscience 
since january the scandal has been the main topic in newspaper 
letters columns many recent letters have defended surveillance 
particularly as a means of controlling crime 
some writers adopt a mocking tone 
one suggested all citizens keep files on themselves and send 
them to the authorities regularly another proposed that all 
dossiers be burned in a huge anniversary bonfire next year 
villiger the defense minister said at his party rally one 
of the worst things that can happen to a state is exposing itself 
to ridicule

a landmark agreement banning world ivory trade 
has begun to crumble posing a renewed threat to the survival of 
the african elephant conservationists say 
the opposition of several african nations had been expected but 
the bombshell came in january when great britain pulled out of the 
accord 
it was a shock to all conservationists says ginette hemley 
director of the us office of traffic the wildlife trade 
monitoring program of the world wildlife fund it was a massive 
turnaround on the part of the united kingdom 
britain had argued forcibly in favor of the ban last fall 
it came down to a fight between the british foreign minister 
and the environment minister hemley says the foreign minister 
recommended that britain pull out to ensure confidence in the hong 
kong economy she says 
the problem with that is it will keep open ivory markets that 
otherwise would have shut down says david western an ecologist 
in nairobi with wildlife conservation international and it sends 
out a signal to certain poachers in africa that hong kong is still 
good as a market and it therefore stimulates poaching once again 
in africa 
nevertheless the ivory trade ban coupled with decisions by the 
united states europe and japan to ban all ivory imports seems to 
have temporarily slowed the slaughter of african elephants hemley 
says 
right now were in a bit of a holding pattern she says 
while poaching is going on we have every reason to believe its 
slowed down dramatically the closing of the us and the european 
markets had a major major effect on the trade and hopefully on 
poaching in the field 
a study is under way to determine the bans precise effect on 
poaching she says 
compared with this time last year the poaching levels are 
down in kenya down in tanzania and down in zaire way down 
says western so viewed overall the picture looks more 
promising 
the price of luxury ivory products has dropped by 70 percent in 
the united states as demand has fallen says hemley in kenya the 
price paid to poachers has dropped from 20 to 50 per kilogram 
22 pounds to 2 to 5 per kilogram hemley says the average 
weight of a tusk in trade is 2 to 4 kilograms 
the population of african elephants has declined from 13 
million in 1979 to an estimated 625000 according to a report 
published in october by the ivory trade review group an 
international team of biologists and environmentalists 
highly organized poachers armed with automatic weapons roam 
freely across african borders killing 10 percent of the remaining 
elephants each year the report estimated 
at that rate elephants will be extinct in the wild within 30 
years says western one of the reports authors 
the report was prepared in advance of a meeting last october in 
lausanne switzerland of the international agency that regulates 
ivory trade 
at that meeting the convention on international trade in 
endangered species of wild fauna and flora delegates from more 
than 100 nations voted to ban trade in ivory around the world but 
with a lastminute compromise that threatened to undo the agreement 
countries were given 90 days to lodge reservations about 
their participation in the trade ban delegates also agreed to 
commission a special review of the ivory trade before the next 
cites meeting in 1992 where the ban conceivably could be 
overturned although that is not considered likely 
zimbabwe zambia south africa malawi and botswana filed 
reservations arguing that they are able to manage their herds well 
enough to cull ivory without depleting their elephant populations 
china also filed a reservation raising fears that a new market 
could develop there but western discounts that possibility 
china is in no position to buy up lots of ivory because it 
doesnt have the hard currency he says 
ivory carvers from hong kong reportedly also have begun moving 
to south korea which is not part of cites but the effect of that 
move also is uncertain 
south korea doesnt have the tradition of using ivory for 
trinkets and bangles and that market doesnt build up overnight 
says western 
hemley notes that south koreas role in wildlife trade has 
increased dramatically during the last few years 
it is a booming economy and potentially the biggest new market 
for luxury ivory products she says 
western who expressed concern last fall that an ironclad ivory 
ban hadnt been enacted is now more sanguine about the african 
elephants future 
the most important consumer countries japan europe and 
america will stick with the ban he says over 80 percent of 
the total demand is in those three countries 
hong kong where most of the worlds ivory carvers are located 
has a supply of 670 tons of ivory on hand reports indicate and 
may be stuck with it 
the hong kong traders are not going to have a very easy time 
unloading that consignment western says the shift in public 
opinion has been so great that ivory will not be a commodity you 
can wear any more elephants will be under much much less pressure 
in the next few yeits sort of touchandgo says hemley the fight 
is by no 
means over

james addison baker iii secretary of state has 
been one of the most powerful men in washington since ronald reagan 
first moved into the white house and one of the most paradoxical 
like his current boss and pal george bush above all the nations 
top diplomat is an adroit politician 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
he swills beer right out of the can at 
blacktie banquets and spits horrid little gobs of tobacco juice 
upon the acutely manicured greens of choice country clubs hes a 
charmer this jim baker 
he has charmed the president and the congress of the united 
states and the president and the congress of peoples deputies of 
the soviet union nancy reagan no slouch for loyalty adored him 
despite his prior command of two campaigns against her husband 
he was the hit rather than boss george bush of the national 
prayer breakfast a few weeks back and his raunchy stories are 
rollicking triumphs with fellows in the locker room michael 
dukakis campaign manager was dazzled by him media misanthropes 
gush over him 
not bad for a man who as secretary of state has claimed little 
global vision who reads few books and has for the longest 
intervals had so little to say to so many eager to hear him say so 
much ask mikhail gorbachev or eduard shevardnadze or the 
tentative leadership of a tentatively free lithuania or the 
chinese students 
jim baker 59 does not hesitate to hesitate nor when he 
likes even to jump ship 
he is the most paradoxical member of the presidents team save 
the president himself and they are like twins fellow houstonians 
except bush is the highbred easterner turned texan and baker the 
highbred texan schooled in the east both tall taut and athletic 
ivy leaguers at home in tennis whites and golf pastels but with a 
yen for sagebrush and bluejeans for shooting quail and ducks and 
turkeys and wadefishing in the bayous for sharing thoughts just 
one to the other 
for months james addison baker iii was as mute as the statues 
in the kremlins catherine hall about the gusts of change in the 
soviet empire some including gorbachev leaders of the nato 
allies and of the us congress were dismayed that the secretary 
of state seemed almost spooked by the opportunities inherent in the 
cold war thaw 
while gorbachev toured the world with a song of conciliation and 
unfolded one new armscontrol initiative after another baker and 
his texas friend bush demurred to the outcome of a strategic 
review of ronald reagans rush to detente with moscow 
no one need have been surprised at the tactics of the new team 
jim baker as architect of bushs lessthanmeteoric rise to the 
presidency and now as vicar of his foreign policy is given even 
less to risk than bush together they have made caution and 
prudence the watchwords of this administration 
which is not to say that either suffers diplomatic lockjaw nor 
for that matter that there havent been some embarrassing slips 
but as baker himself explains it sometimes a proactive policy 
is best advanced by doing nothing until the right time 
and after that agonizingly dilatory start the president and 
baker have moved from tentative probing to vigorous advocacy of a 
friendlier eastwest relationship a socalled no agenda 
shipboard summit off malta in december led bush to advance 21 
specific proposals for greater comity between the superpowers stay 
tuned bushgorbachev ii is coming to washington on may 30 
to jim baker timing is everything any politician knows that 
any lawyer knows that he is both even if he doesnt care to admit 
it years ago in his sole unsuccessful stab at elective office 
he campaigned on the slogan texas needs a lawyer not a 
politician for attorney general and he was once overheard 
snapping at an aide im a lawyer not a politician and dont 
ever forget it 
dont believe it either fact is baker who once regarded 
election days as a chance to go hunting ranks as one of the most 
politically oriented secretaries of state in history from the 
moment he settled into his small back office behind the huge 
ceremonial one he let it be known that he was george bushs 
representative at the state department and not the state 
departments representative at the white house 
at times baker acts as if he were still running bushs 1988 
campaign last september he was challenged to respond to the 
complaint of senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine that 
the administration was dragging its feet on superpower issues 
baker rather than addressing that charge replied when the 
president is rocking along with a 70 percent approval rating on his 
handling of foreign policy if i were the leader of the opposition 
i might have something similar to say 
bakers pollwatching galls the foreign services idealists who 
argue that in a rapidly changing world the boldest vision can be 
the most realistic the most aggressive policy the most prudent 
baker first as ronald reagans chief of staff then as treasury 
secretary and now as secretary of state has been a master at 
working congress and he insists that his lieutenants emulate his 
meticulous courtesy when dealing with the legislative branch he 
typically works until 9 pm or so with most of those evening 
hours occupied with initiating or returning calls to capitol hill 
on his 41line telephone 
and it is through congress that he sometimes exercises his 
power after weeks of israeli footdragging on his proposal for a 
negotiated settlement of the palestinian issue he induced sen bob 
dole of kansas the republican leader to suggest taking aid from 
israel and egypt and giving it to eastern europe baker then 
publicly smiled upon doles trial balloon while insisting the idea 
had no connection with the palestinian dispute 
at cabinet meetings baker occupies the traditional seat of 
honor at the presidents right rightly so no man or woman enjoys 
more presidential confidence and none can so comfortably tell him 
that he is dead wrong about something there are others who 
can bush once said but they dont

without jim baker george bush might not have become president 
because without baker bush would not have been vice president and 
ronald reagans anointed successor 
it was in may 1980 when baker looked at reagans delegate 
numbers and leaked it to the press that his candidate bush would 
be withdrawing from the presidential race that was news to bush 
who several hundred miles away at the time fully intended to 
press reagan in the windup primaries in new jersey ohio and 
california reagans home state 
a furious bush summoned baker and his staff to his home in 
houston as bush tells the story in his book looking forward 
he insisted to baker that he still had a shot 
baker george youve got to know when to hold em and know 
when to fold em 
bush jim ive never quit anything until it was finished 
baker but the campaign is finished george youre the only 
one who doesnt seem to know it 
bush withdrew and reagan got a unified convention in detroit 
what ill admit to but george never will baker said in 1981 
is that the veep thing was always the fallback it was always in 
my mind thats why at every opportunity i had him cool his 
rhetoric about reagan and reagan he added would have been 
terminally ticked off had bush pursued him into california 
it wasnt the vice presidentelect who landed him his job in the 
reagan white house a fact baker is quick to confide to anyone who 
suggests that he remains especially beholden to bush instead it 
was reagans longtime california confidant michael k deaver and 
nancy reagan who sold the new president on making baker the white 
house chief of staff reagan loyalists initially were aghast but 
later viewed the appointment as a key to reagans firstterm 
success 
baker did have enemies in the reagan administration and he 
wasnt entirely successful at cutting them down he often found 
himself at odds with thencounselor edwin meese and defense 
secretary caspar weinberger and particularly with national 
security adviser william clark and secretary of state alexander 
haig the latter two were not at all pleased with his resistance to 
their efforts to expand us military involvement in central 
america 
jim saw himself as guardian of the presidents legislative 
agenda and was convinced that if we got too far into this it could 
jeopardize our ability to get anything through congress deaver 
recalled 
in 1983 clark left to become interior secretary and baker 
pressed reagan to make him his national security adviser with 
deaver taking the chief of staff job reagan agreed but then found 
himself confronted in the oval office by the quartet of meese cia 
director william casey weinberger and clark all of whom opposed 
the appointment baker told the president to kill the plan if it 
were a problem for him reagan did 
baker wearied by the white house infighting jumped at treasury 
secretary donald regans offer to swap jobs after the 1984 
election reagan did agree to that one and baker took his oneman 
think tank his protege richard g darman with him 
at treasury baker built a record which ranks him beside henry 
h fowler and john b connally as the most influential occupants of 
that job since world war ii 
in his 3 years there with darman brainstorming behind the 
scenes he negotiated major international agreements for economic 
coordination among industrialized nations for dealing with third 
world debt and for an orderly decline in the dollar thus 
boosting us exports he was credited too with the singlehanded 
rescue of the uscanada free trade agreement when those talks 
were on the brink of collapse most notably he pushed through a 
major tax reform in part by conceding credit and a prominent role 
to congressional democrats 
none of those steps has yet drawn consensus raves from 
economists or historians the budget and trade deficits have barely 
been dented and the problem of third world defaults wont go away 
but without his initiatives says baker matters would have been 
a great deal worse 
bakers reputation for honesty was tainted when by his own 
admission he told an unnecessary falsehood on national television 
last year to conceal the first trip of presidential envoys to 
beijing following the tiananmen square massacre in retrospect 
said baker he should have nocommented 
he was less than adroit too when he adlibbed an expression of 
confidence about germanys continued membership in or 
association with nato as if to open germanys way out of the 
alliance and toward neutrality he disavowed the association 
with phrase but the slip served to weaken the us position in 
the eyes of other diplomats 
though generally familiar with global issues from his years with 
reagan baker came to his new job with huge gaps in his knowledge 
of the international players and the nuances of diplomacy he was 
upstaged during some of his early encounters like that first trip 
to moscow where gorbachev caught him off balance with an 
announcement of soviet troop cutbacks in europe but after more 
than 300 meetings with foreign leaders and 150000 miles of travel 
baker is much more selfassured 
twentyone years ago baker was a corporate attorney in houston 
nominally a democrat who didnt bother to vote in most elections 
and really didnt participate in partisan politics in any way

not so for bakers wife and college sweetheart mary stuart 
mchenry who had grown up in dayton ohio across the street from a 
relative of bushs when bush ran unsuccessfully for the senate in 
1964 she donned a straw boater and passed out leaflets some years 
earlier she once had attempted to organize a republican precinct 
meeting in her living room one person came baker recalls i 
served the drinks 
other than that baker remained on the political sidelines 
though bush who won a house seat two years later became a 
frequent hunting and fishing companion as well as tennis partner 
and they regularly attended services together at st martins 
episcopal church 
then in 1969 as bush was preparing for a second stab at the 
senate bakers world collapsed mary stuart was dying of cancer 
bush accompanied his distraught buddy on the hospital visits then 
to the funeral convinced that he needed a new challenge to salve 
the grief bush implored baker to manage his campaign in harris 
county houston and the surrounding area finally baker accepted 
bush lost again but baker was hooked in 1972 he served as 
state gop finance chairman and ran the 14 texas gulf coast 
counties for richard m nixon and in 1975 bush by then nixons 
special envoy to china recommended him to commerce secretary 
rogers cb morton as an undersecretary just eight months later 
he was recruited to follow morton into president fords campaign 
which faced a stiff and burgeoning challenge from ronald reagan for 
the gop nomination morton made baker the chief delegate hunter 
to track and woo uncommitted delegates and to keep fords own 
convention force in line against reagans surging bandwagon he 
proved so effective that ford replaced morton with baker for the 
general election campaign ford came from 30 points down to lose a 
squeaker to jimmy carter 
in 1978 baker made his only attempt to win elective office 
himself as texas attorney general he thought his opponent would 
be liberal price daniel but he found himself facing mark white a 
more conservative and far more popular democrat baker lost 
there have been other setbacks 
bakers remarriage to susan garrett winston his first wifes 
closest friend and the widow of a baker acquaintance triggered 
resentments among the seven children by their previous spouses but 
those family problems have now been patched up 
jim and susan have had one child together mary bonner 12 the 
other seven are grown 
what jim baker wants most to do according to some intimates is 
get the job now held by friend george 
baker categorically denies this saying he intends to be 
secretary of state for eight years then drive himself and susan to 
his ranch in wyoming 
but a princeton friend phil uzielli remembers that during the 
bush campaign a group of us were sitting around and someone said 
again that jimmy is the one who should be president not george he 
loved it and he let the talk go on a bit before shutting it down 
susan baker acknowledges that jimmy has a tremendous ambition 
and drive to reach the top but the presidency is the last thing in 
his mind right now hes got to be the best secretary of state 
he can the rest may come later 
obviously being president is on his mind says former 
democratic national chairman robert strauss hes that smart and 
that shrewd and that ambitious he knows theres only one job in 
washington worth having

washington secretary of state jim baker is the scion of one of 
houstons most distinguished families the bakers of baker amp 
botts one of the largest and oldest law firms west of the 
mississippi 
his buttondown shirts say jab iii but he is actually the 
fourth james a baker 
the first his greatgrandfather was a civil war veteran and 
district judge who moved to houston and cofounded the firm after 
the war his grandfather known as captain baker a title bestowed 
by the ceremonial houston light guard was a founder and chairman 
of the texas commerce bank and most dramatically unraveled the 
murder of his client new york industrialist william march rice in 
the fall of 1900 captain baker proved that rice had been done in 
by a butler and lawyer who had prepared a false will his sleuthing 
saved the fortune with which rice university was built 
jim bakers father the third senior partner in baker amp botts 
was called the warden by jims friends he was a stern 
disciplinarian quick to administer whippings and urge jim and 
sister bonnie to new challenges like jumping off the high dive no 
matter how scared they were baker recalls his father often 
awakened him by throwing ice water into his face gets you up 
real fast he said 
following his father baker attended the hill school and 
princeton he did a twoyear stint in the marines commissioned as 
a lieutenant the korean war was on but he spent most of his time 
on a ship in the mediterranean then he went home to texas for law 
school where he made the law review and missed by one slot the 
order of the coif accorded the 10 percent of the graduating 
class he remains disappointed about that minor failure even 
dwells on it to this day 
baker barred from joining his fathers firm by a 
sinceabandoned antinepotism rule made his own mark as a 
corporate attorney amassing assets now estimated at 4 million 
he was little known outside legal circles and the houston 
country club where he and a fellow member won the tennis doubles 
championship twice in the early 1960s but baker a democrat by 
family tradition and george bush a local oilman and son of a 
connecticut republican senator kept politics out of their game

no one in the ronald reagan administration 
with the possible exception of secretary of state george shultz 
achieved the stature that jim baker did 
as white house chief of staff he cultivated members of congress 
from the start and rolled up legislative victories that eluded 
other couriers of the reagan program he also assiduously courted 
the news media provoking donald regan his successor as chief of 
staff to tell a republican group that he was appalled at the 
amount of time baker spent with reporters and thencia director 
william casey to complain that baker was the biggest leaker in town 
but his supporters credited baker with pushing the essential 
elements of reagans firstterm agenda through congress including 
those surprisingly early triumphs on the budget and taxes 
fashioned by luring boll weevil democrats into a new hill 
majority 
some critics fault him for just those successes saying he too 
often orchestrated shortterm victories without much caring about 
the lasting consequences a burgeoning federal deficit foremost 
among them 
he was much more of a mr fixit than planner much more 
interested in politics than in policy said former reagan 
treasury official john e chapoton a onetime law partner and 
neighbor of bakers 
william a niskanen jr a former member of the council of 
economic advisers said he doesnt bring any particular 
convictions to bear on a job other than doing a good job i 
dont think he has any particular vision 
david stockman director of the office of management and budget 
during bakers tenure at the white house wrote that baker was 
deep down neither very versed on matters of policy nor intensely 
interested in them 
baker at the time admitted as much i dont consider myself 
as one who has deeply held views on specific issues he told 
washingtonian magazine in 1982 
baker might have found himself the odd man out among reagans 
coterie of californians around the oval office but under a plan 
drawn up by his prickly but creative sidekick richard g darman 
he quickly managed to seize control of the white house paper flow 
to the president 
with that came power particularly the ability to knife his 
enemies and praise his own work according to an undelighted but 
impressed paul m weyrich president of the superconservative free 
congress research and education foundation

power says secretary of state jim baker must 
be put in perspective 
power doesnt really bring the fulfillment that many think it 
does baker told a national prayer breakfast in february as 
president bush and 3000 other government employees listened 
over these last nine years baker said i have had 
opportunities to participate in the exercise of more power than i 
would even have imagined i have felt the weight of responsibility 
that that brings and i have to admit to you as well that i have 
felt the temptations that are attendant to it 
but that changed he said when he came up against a personal 
problem several years ago he didnt say what it was perhaps he 
referred to the tribulations with his son john who was arrested in 
1982 fined 2000 and required to enter a drug treatment program 
for selling marijuana 
his wife susan baker said helped him pray and to recognize 
that i really needed to stop trying to play god and turn the 
matter over to him without this kind of partnership im 
convinced i would never have resolved the problem 
baker also described another moment that drove home in his 
mind the fleeting nature of power he was riding to the white 
house in his limousine he said when he noticed a familiar figure 
walking alone on the sidewalk 
he was someone many of you would have recognized a chief of 
staff in a previous administration baker said there he was 
alone no reporters no security no adoring public no trappings 
of power just one solitary man alone with his thoughts 
that mental picture continually serves to remind me of the 
impermanence of power and place that man had it all but only for 
a time that memory puts my own life in perspective

if a lot of people cling to general de gaulles image and say 
they have something gaullist about them it shows that his politics 
and ideas were very realistic he says 
de gaulle had a large family but he left no dynasty behind him 
his son admiral philippe de gaulle is a senator two grandsons 
are members of the national assembly laurent is not sure about 
running for office 
the generals shoes all agree are not easy to fill 
charles andre marie joseph de gaulle was born into a family 
going back five centuries into what was known as the swordbearing 
officer class 
france at the time in its belle epoch had produced monet 
degas cezanne gauguin matisse toulouselautrec and renoir 
rodin was sculpting proust was dreaming and rostand had written 
cyrano de bergerac 
de gaulles father a teacher kindled an interest in history 
and geography but young charles knew his role biographers 
recounted how in a game of toy soldiers his brother wanted to be 
king of france 
never charles blurted out france is mine 
when france was his he treated it with respect shunning the 
trappings of power he remained an acting brigadier general even 
when called back from retirement in 1958 to end the algerian war 
despite his postwar popularity he could not consolidate the 
turbulent politics wondering aloud how joan of arc would have 
looked atop a coalition he retreated in 1946 to his beloved woods 
his only home was the modest boisserie in colombey a former 
brewery bought in 1934 with a small downpayment from his colonels 
pay he lived simply amusing himself with long lone walks 
during the bitter war over algeria maverick officers attempting 
a coup detat were such a threat that de gaulle got back on the 
radio for another appeal frenchmen frenchwomen help me 
later diehard terrorists sprayed gunfire at his armored 
citroen among four other attempts on his life but for security 
de gaulle relied mostly on his aloof and forbidding presence 
his political undoing came about on the streets of paris in 
1968 rioting students rebelling at a stagnating france under a 
leader from another age set politics to boil 
de gaulle held a referendum his old device to challenge france 
to find a better way the vote showed he had lost the nations 
confidence he left the presidency and a year later he died 
he is buried in a modest tomb at the little church in colombey 
not far away a 150foottall graniteandbronze cross of lorraine 
is visible for miles around 
one of the two fragments of gaullist philosophy chipped in the 
stone asserts there exists a pact over 20 centuries between the 
greatness of france and freedom in the world 
but genevieve anthonioz de gaulle a favorite niece prefers the 
second which she feels sums up her uncles long spare life in 
our time the only dispute of value is mans it is man who must be 
saved allowed to live and to develop 
each year 120000 frenchmen and foreigners come here out of 
respect or simple curiosity during 1990 memories will be closer 
at hand 
jacques chirac the mayor of paris who ran for president for the 
neogaullist rpr in march opened a display of photos documents 
and memorabilia the piece de resistance is a wax general de

satirical weekly le canard enchaine to draw its own version with 
a protruding annex to accommodate de gaulles ample nose 
from nov 1924 the charles de gaulle institute and the un 
educational scientific and cultural organization are sponsoring a 
seminar entitled de gaulle in his century 
since 1986 the institute has commissioned 500 studies from 
specialists in 50 countries to add to existing gaulliana its own

back in the 70s there was talk of a 
backtothecity movement in places like detroit that was mostly 
talk today detroit faces an uncertain future with tens of 
thousands of derelict homes and businesses simply abandoned by 
their owners but the city is trying to fight back 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
nearly 300 years after its founding as a french 
colony detroit is looking for new settlers willing to stake claims 
to a city losing ground every month to blight and desertion 
thousands of abandoned houses are being demolished in a 
multimilliondollar effort to prevent arson and drugs from 
spreading throughout neighborhoods still trying to hold their own 
in addition lowinterest loans are being offered to renovate 
derelict homes 
after 40 years of white flight to the suburbs detroit like 
many other cities has become a tattered patchwork of new downtown 
highrises aging public housing modest subdivisions squalid 
tenements and everbroader stretches of vacant land 
despite scattered private and public renovation efforts the 
city has become the reluctant landlord of 20 percent of its total 
land area as buildings and vacant lots revert to city control 
because of unpaid taxes 
unofficial estimates say there are 80000 parcels of vacant land 
within the city between 50000 and 60000 of those are owned by 
the city which has no overall strategy for developing them 
the detroit free press in july 1989 counted more than 15000 
abandoned buildings in detroit twothirds of them vacant 
singlefamily homes 
gary sands a professor of urban geography at wayne state 
university blames the citys economic social and image problems 
the city lost 100000 jobs between 1980 and 1988 when its 
population fell from 12 million to about 1 million the 1990 
census is expected to show a drop below 1 million 
a lot of the problem with the vacant derelict land is that 
there is no market for it sands says theres no demand 
detroits closest suburbs attracted increasing numbers of 
relatively affluent bettereducated blacks during the 1980s while 
predominantly white suburban sprawl stretched even farther 
sands says the city must find a way to lure a generation native 
to the suburbs and which except for downtown entertainment avoids 
detroit 
people want bright shiny stuff theyre not interested in 
pioneering he says detroit has never had the real 
highdensity office core like new york that makes people want to 
live close to where they work theres more commuting from suburb 
to suburb than from suburb to central city 
robert berg mayor coleman youngs press secretary puts part of 
the blame on negative news reports 
we get tired of reading stories that convince people that we 
in detroit live in little brokendown frame houses with a crack 
house next door berg says 
urban experts say the problem of abandonment of central cities 
isnt confined to the rust belt 
aggressive redevelopment of downtown areas is under way in 
cities as farflung as boise idaho beaumont texas and 
charlotte nc says ann bowman a political scientist at the 
university of south carolina 
suburban sprawl likely will continue during the 1990s even in 
cities with stronger housing markets and more aggressive 
redevelopment plans than detroits says h james brown director 
of the joint center for urban studies at harvard universitys 
kennedy school of government 
detroit is actually leading a path that other cities may be on 
in the next 10 years brown says all communities are going to 
find that there isnt the central city housing demand that there 
has been 
even in the 70s when it was alleged that there was a 
backtothecity movement young people were more likely to be 
moving to the suburbs 
in detroit berg says the city and nine banks recently pooled 
40 million to form the detroit neighborhood investment corp 
which provides lowinterest loans for renovating existing housing 
a few private investors have joined the reclamation effort on 
their own 
a corporation headed by grosse pointe developer jim saros bought 
the 62yearold chalfonte apartments on the lower east side for 
400000 it spent an additional 700000 to renovate the 20unit 
building that had been vacant for seven years 
detroit has spent 15 million to demolish 3000 vacant 
structures this fiscal year the budget includes another 15 
million to tear down 3000 more buildings by june 30 
one of the things youre doing when you knock down the 
abandoned houses is do it quickly before it spreads like a 
cancer berg says 
marcell mayberry has seen that cancer ravage much of her lower 
eastside neighborhood now she fears it may reach algonquin 
street too 
a sagging woodframe bungalow next to mayberrys house is so 
far the only abandoned house on algonquin mayberry cuts the grass 
and joins other neighbors in keeping watch for arsonists or 
vandals she says she never sees the owner 
the neighborhoods decline began about 10 years ago when 
absentee landlords began renting to welfare clients and neglected 
their property mayberry says later came the crack dealers 
burglars and arsonists 
mayberry is unimpressed by grayhaven a condominiummarina 
project under construction near her home 
when this crack cocaine came in thats when things started 
disappearing she says its an epidemic and there aint 
nothing anyone can do about it if theyve got the same problems 
weve got how are grayhaven residents going to help 
in cleveland 16 million has been spent to demolish abandoned 
buildings over the past decade says mike marcelino a spokesman 
for mayor michael white that compares with 15 million this year 
alone in detroit whose population is about twice that of cleveland 
when you start tearing down housing you can quickly ruin a 
street or neighborhood marcelino says hows it going to 
affect the houses on either side a lot of people cannot afford a 
new house 
cleveland officials have created a land bank to pool vacant 
property in hopes of redevelopment says norman krumholtz the 
citys former planning director 
in strategic locations they assemble enough property so you 
have some kind of reasonable development says krumholtz a 
professor of urban planning at cleveland state university 
although the real estate market is soft in cleveland the land 
bank lets the city clear the titles and sit on it until it 
becomes ripe again he says 
besides lacking specific incentives for developing large 
clusters of vacant land a 1985 revision to detroits 1969 master 
plan still awaits city council approval says councilman mel ravitz 
we could and should be doing a whole lot more to woo investors 
for residential development or rehabilitation he says the 
city apparently has not appeared attractive enough to the 
risktaking developers

hes a composer for our time a man who writes 
operas about the social condition of the modern world sir michael 
tippett though better known in his native england than in america 
has been called one of the three or four giant composers in the 
last half of the 20th century 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
sir michael tippett the 85yearold british 
composer who was briefly jailed as a pacifist during world war ii 
is a musician with a message 
to him the sight of young people dancing on the berlin wall was 
a marvelous piece of theater for one thing no shots were 
fired 
for 50 years sir michael has been writing his philosophical 
reflections on world events into his oratorio and opera libretti 
ever since ts eliot gave him some tips for writing a child of 
our time which became his first major success 
a child of our time was inspired by a young jew who killed a 
nazi official in paris providing the excuse for kristallnacht the 
prelude to the holocaust 
when i wrote a child of our time i had to come out from any 
notion that what i was writing was just for my countrymen says 
the silverhaired composer i had to write something about a 
condition that seemed to me really universal 
sir michaels opera king priam used a greek myth to explore 
politics power and choice his opera the ice break explores 
violence racism and political turmoil 
in the knot garden one of his characters was a scarred 
woman he thought of her as a french underground fighter whod been 
tortured by the gestapo in world war ii when the opera was 
performed recently in melbourne australia the character became a 
chinese student in tiananmen square 
sir michael who attended the performance approved of the 
change 
if a work has value it will proceed in this way from a now to 
another now he says 
sir peter hall who staged the premiere of sir michaels fifth 
opera new year last october in houston has called sir 
michael a child of our time in each decade 
there is something extremely young about him he says he 
hasnt closed up at all 
the glyndebourne festival will stage the english premiere of 
new year on july 1 bbc television will tape it and there is 
talk of productions in canada holland and germany in december 
sir michael finished byzantium which the chicago symphony will 
premiere in april 1991 to honor carnegie halls 100th birthday 
hes now composing his fifth string quartet 
david gockley general director of the houston grand opera 
says i think he is probably one of the three or four giant 
composers in the last half of the 20th century 
in this country he is predominantly known for his orchestral 
works he has made the rounds of every major symphony in the last 
25 years conducting his big orchestral works 
in operas he puts together these fantastical collages of 
allegory i think his philosophical approach to the problems of 
complicated urbanized society has won him a great deal of friends 
among young people and people that share his concerns 
when he was about 25 sir michael was strongly impressed by the 
movie the four horsemen of the apocalypse starring rudolph 
valentino in which a father wanders among the white crosses of a 
cemetery in flanders 
i realized all those wonderful young people had gone to the 
ground and never had a life at all he says when it came to 
the next war it came to me that these young people could have been 
scapegoats people thrown out by a society i had to sing in some 
way about them i could not get them out of my mind theyre there 
to this day 
in england where he is better known than he is in america sir 
michael has a fan club and members get just as paul mccartneys 
fans do a newsletter about his activities performances and 
recordings 
the kent opera is currently taking king priam on tour to six 
cities 
sir michael is conducting one recording a year of his 
compositions for nimbus records his eyesight is failing making it 
difficult for him to conduct concerts recordings are easier 
when covent garden was rehearsing sir michaels the ice 
break in 1977 he told a reporter hed never write another opera 
that answer was given at the time i knew i was getting on in 
age and strength he says i had already decided i would like 
to do a big work for voices and orchestra for the concert hall it 
became the mask of time 
after having completed the mask of time i still was very 
vigorous and the theater took over again i dont quite know why it 
did but it did 
sir michael celebrated becoming 85 on jan 2 by accepting 
invitations to hear his music played in several cities 
the university of cincinnatis collegeconservatory of music 
performed his opera the knot garden sir michael called the 
performances brilliant and the production masterly adding and 
ive seen a lot of them 
the cincinnati symphony performed his lyrical fantasia 
concertante on a theme of corelli 
at intermission a young woman was overheard to say i liked 
the mozart but the tippett completely blew me away i loved it 
jesus lopezcobos music director of the cincinnati symphony 
says i think tippett is one of the big composers of british 
composers benjamin britten is more known here i think tippetts 
time will come too 
about britten sir michael says we were mildly rivals if you 
like we both wanted to go into theater we didnt think the operas 
of the preceding generation were workable 
sir michael says that on the eve of his entering prison for 
three months in world war ii as a pacifist britten was much more 
frightened than i was 
now he says the world is changing very quickly to my great 
delight and surprise ive lived long enough to see young people 
dancing on the berlin wall a marvelous piece of theater for one 
who believes you cant really do it by guns it was done in another 
way

its one of the last of the mom and pop 
jails a place where serving time is a family affair if youve got 
to be locked up the gilmer county jail in west virginia would sure 
beat rikers island in new york city 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
at lee and terri fredericks place room 
guests enjoy oldfashioned home cooking and are greeted at 
breakfast with a friendly good morning 
they can watch television play table tennis in the recreation 
room use the telephone and entertain visitors in the familys 
garage 
but dont pack your bags for a weekend in the mountains the 
fredericks place is the gilmer county jail one of the nations 
last mom and pop jails 
the jail owes more to mayberry than to attica or alcatraz 
while inmates eat terris pasta pizza and meat dishes in their 
upstairs cells the fredericks are eating the same fare downstairs 
i just make extra for the guys upstairs mrs frederick says 
every other thursday the couple pulls their 1986 chrysler out 
of their garage and sets up folding chairs so inmates can entertain 
visitors 
the fredericks house rules are posted in the jails recreation 
room 
golden rules if you open it close it if you take it out 
lock it up if it will brighten someones day say it 
the fredericks live with their two sons joey 6 and lynn 2 
in a threebedroom brick house whose upstairs cells have housed the 
countys criminals for 50 years 
the twostory building built of fleshcolored brick sits atop 
a hill sandwiched between the county courthouse and a glenville 
state college dormitory 
the rest of the neighborhood is made up of modest singlefamily 
homes that look a lot like the frederick house except for the bars 
on the windows 
lee 29 is a former truck driver who took the job of jailer a 
year ago terri 27 who lived in the house as a child when her 
parents ran the jail now does the cooking and cleaning 
in her spare time she dispatches sheriffs deputies local 
police ambulances and rescue workers from her living room the 
room also has alarms for glenvilles two banks 
until recently when a night jailer was hired one of them was 
always on duty from 7 am to midnight after that prisoners could 
summon lee by pushing a button on the elevator that connects the 
first and second floors 
mrs frederick stays in touch with wallmounted loudspeakers 
that allow her to hear calls when shes working in the kitchen 
its easy to know whats happening in the jail because we can 
hear them right through the ceiling mrs frederick says 
frederick says his sons are not allowed upstairs no matter how 
curious they get 
theyll find out about this stuff soon enough anyway he 
says 
on an average day the jail houses about nine prisoners most 
detained for drunken driving destruction of property or game law 
violations 
in the evenings prisoners play table tennis or watch television 
in a family sized recreation room they have access to the couples 
telephone every night but long distance calls are not allowed 
such homey touches arent lost on the inmates 
lee treats me ok and the foods all right but i just dont 
like being in jail says carson yeager 45 who described himself 
as a chronic alcoholic 
yeager is one of the fredericks regulars 
the majority of ours are not hardened criminals frederick 
says they dont need to be exposed to that type of people 
some former inmates even come back to say hello occasionally a 
21yearold former inmate now incarcerated elsewhere has written 
the couple four letters in the last two months 
still rural mom and pop jails are increasingly being phased 
out because of generally substandard conditions high maintenance 
costs and a move toward regional jails 
they are a rapidly dying breed says michael otoole chief 
of the jails division of the national institute of corrections 
more than 19 million people filter through 3300 county jails 
each year according to us justice department statistics 
small jails are not cost effective otoole says although 
a lot are wellmeaning and wellintentioned the conditions of 
confinement arent what they should be a lot are just incapable of 
being up to standards 
the operation rises and falls on the integrity of the 
operator for each example where somebody is fulfilling their 
responsibility you can look at another side of the ledger and see 
someone who shouldnt have any authority over anybody in custody 
whatsoever 
recently the state facilities review panel took aim at the 
fredericks warning it would shut the jail down if gilmer county 
officials didnt add staff at the jail 
so sheriff kenneth smith jr hired a nightshift jailer and 
beefed up the parttime staff so the fredericks only have to work 
40 hours a week 
its cramped our personal lives a little bit sure 
frederick says

his mother was a maid in memphis tenn who 
brought books for him to read from the white homes where she 
worked today eddie n williams heads the joint center for 
political studies a research group playing an increasingly 
important role as blacks move into the political mainstream 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
eddie n williams is constantly on the phone 
these days fielding questions what with black politicians so much 
in the news 
is jesse jackson maintaining his hold on black voters 
how did l douglas wilder pull off his election as the first 
black governor of virginia 
how is the indictment of mayor marion barry playing among black 
voters in the nations capital 
those are the kinds of questions people regularly ask williams 
president of the joint center for political studies a littleknown 
research institute he has built into the countrys premier black 
think tank 
the center has a staff of 60 providing research on the social 
political and economic activities and concerns of africanamericans 
it is most well known for the annual roster of black elected 
officials which has charted the growth of black officeholders 
from the 600 it originally listed to the more than 7000 now 
included 
the center now occupies a special political niche at a time when 
black candidates and voters are playing an increasingly influential 
role in national and local politics 
the mainstream is the new frontier for black politicians 
williams says citing the 1989 elections of wilder in virginia and 
david dinkins as mayor of new york 
thats where the jobs are he says all of the positions 
that are in predominantly black jurisdictions have just about been 
filled 
largely disenfranchised in many southern states until the 
mid1960s blacks can now claim credit for electing democratic 
senators in places like alabama georgia louisiana and north 
carolina 
the mayors of new york los angeles chicago and philadelphia 
all are black 
yet 18 years ago the president of the university of chicago was 
startled to hear that williams his vice president for public 
affairs was leaving to head a relatively unknown research 
organization 
the challenge to me is to make you hear about it was 
williams response 
the black electorate remains overwhelmingly democratic but two 
photographs deliberately juxtaposed on a wall in williams office 
symbolize how jealously he guards the nonpartisan status of the 
center 
one shows williams with president bush in the other he is with 
twotime democratic presidential contender jackson 
people dont knock the joint center as being liberal or 
conservative or republican or democratic and thats a very 
difficult position for a black organization to maintain says 
robert bates a mobil oil co lobbyist and close friend of williams 
its a good role to be in to call the shots as you see 
them says williams ill comment on the republicans and ill 
comment on the democrats i let the chips fall where they may 
one question williams is asked frequently is whether president 
bush and republican party chairman lee atwater can achieve their 
goal of making significant gains for the republican party among 
black voters 
the opportunity is there williams says but until the 
republicans can succeed in recruiting some visible black leaders 
with a following and until they disabuse themselves of the notion 
that they can create a black leader theyre going to only be 
modestly successful 
williams 57 was born in memphis tenn the only child of ed 
williams a onearmed jazz piano player and his wife georgia a 
maid at hotels and welltodo private homes in the city 
from her williams learned the value of finding and assembling 
seemingly evasive information 
williams says his mother would often bring home books clothes 
and other artifacts from the homes in which she worked 
this is what that white boys reading now you ought to be 
reading it williams recalls her saying he says he read the 
materials that were otherwise not available to black children in 
the segregated school systems of the south during the 1930s and 
1940s 
bebe bowers fingall a high school english teacher called 
mama by her students helped hone williams competitive spirit 
and selfconfidence 
williams says that as one of mamas pets he was drawn 
toward all kinds of writing and speaking anthologies and plays 
after earning a bachelors degree in journalism from the 
university of illinois he did graduate work in political science 
at atlanta and howard universities 
williams also served as director of the center for policy 
studies at the university of chicago he was director of the us 
office of equal employment opportunity and a foreign service 
reserve officer at the state department 
williams has two children a son edward 24 who is a graduate 
student at the peabody school of music at johns hopkins university 
and a daughter tracy 26 who is an actress at the living stage 
theater in washington dc 
his 21yearold stepson terrence reddick is a senior at george 
mason university in virginia 
but his baby is the joint center for political studies as 
reflected on the wall of his office in a framed and matted 
paraphrase of a popular slogan have you hugged your 501 c 3 
today a reference to the section in us law that grants 
taxexempt status to nonprofit organizations 
the center is funded by 3 million a year in grants from private 
foundations and corporations 
what he has done is to provide a place for substantial high 
quality objective research where none existed before says 
norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute a 
conservative washington think tank 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif the oldest and longestserving 
black member of the house and chairman of the education and labor 
committee says he calls on the centers statistical data and 
analysis on a variety of issues if i want to focus in on a 
minority viewpoint or get the specifics 
the unofficial link between black elected officials and center 
dates to its beginning when noted black psychologist kenneth clark 
and several of the countrys thenleading black politicians founded 
the center and secured a 2 million grant from the ford foundation 
williams hopes to secure the centers financial future with a 
10 million endowment the ford foundation has pledged 5 million 
which williams is working to match 
the center which celebrated its 20th anniversary this month 
opened its doors in 1970 to provide technical assistance to a newly 
emerging cadre of black elected officials from the ranks of 
teachers preachers farmers and local community activists 
our role was to help them better understand the processes of 
governance to share some information and some expertise about 
administration planning budgeting identification of resource 
acquisition those kinds of technical things williams says 
the center also served to document the nature and extent of 
black political participation he says

it may seem odd for kevin kline to play a 
philandering pizza parlor owner in the outrageous new film i love 
you to death and then star in and direct hamlet offbroadway 
but the versatile goodlooking actor shuttles from bigbudget 
movie to shakespeare classic with ease its something he has done 
for the last decade or so alternating bigleague bard like 
richard iii henry v and much ado about nothing with 
films like sophies choice silverado and a fish called 
wanda 
i love you to death is black comedy opera buffo without 
the music its a flamboyant motion picture filled with purple 
passion and bananapeel humor as a mousy wife tracey ullman 
tries again and again to murder her adulterous husband kline 
not exactly the melancholy dane which is klines other current 
project and now on view at the new york shakespeare festival 
public theater its a role he first did there four years ago and 
his return to it is a rarity american actors usually dont get a 
second chance with hamlet 
in england there is a tradition of doing hamlet twice and 
i can understand why the genial softspoken kline was saying 
the other day like any great classical part you can only get 
part of it when you do it once there are so many different ways to 
go its the biggest open door in theater 
klines initial attempt at hamlet in 1986 was thoughtful 
clearspoken and introspective but the production directed by 
liviu ciulei received mixed reviews 
there were rumors that i was unhappy with my first hamlet 
he says of course i was unhappy with it ill be unhappy 
with this one there is no way to be completely satisfied with any 
given production of hamlet and theres also no way to satisfy a 
large group of people its like a rorschach test everybody has 
their very own personal response to the play 
while preparing for that first hamlet kline knew he would 
do it a second time it was something he and joseph papp head of 
the shakespeare festival knew they would do going into it i 
said i dont want to do this just once kline recalls and 
papp agreed 
what he hadnt planned on was directing the play himself his 
first job at directing steven berkoff who did a striking modern 
dress coriolanus at the public theater was to have directed 
the new production but the success of his version of oscar wildes 
salome in london kept him in england 
with papps blessing kline took over 
it was a decision that was arrived at spontaneously after 
years and years of thinking about it kline jokes i had been 
thinking about directing for a couple of years and suggested it to 
joe i thought why not direct a play i know pretty well theres 
no way you can know a play better than having played so central a 
character 
for the first time in his career kline became involved in an 
entire production not only the direction but the design sets 
costumes and lighting and casting 
was it odd sitting on the other side of the fence auditioning 
his fellow performers 
i love actors and i have a great sympathy for the audition 
process which is one of the more barbaric aspects of show 
business kline says im not a good auditioner myself so i 
take each audition with a grain of salt you cant show everything 
in an audition 
he knew the work of some of the actors like brian murray who 
plays claudius and dana ivey who plays gertrude so well that he 
didnt ask them to audition others he did sometimes even getting 
up on stage to act out scenes with them 
a lot of them said if it doesnt happen it was fun working 
on it kline says they knew that they couldnt all be in it 
the director simply has to find the actor who is best suited for 
each role 
ask kline about his ideas for hamlet and he hesitates 
begging off answering since he had just started rehearsals but 
its not one of those weird productions that set the play in mexico 
in the 19th century or some other exotic place and time he reveals 
its a nonconcept concept production he laughs right 
now it takes place where it did in shakespeares time on a stage 
that is denmark but shakespeares denmark we are just taking our 
cues from the play 
and thats how h houston ap the number of w and natural gas 
rigs declined ount showed a modest decrease after posting a gain of 
53 rigs the previous week a year ago the count was 778 baker 
hughes said monday 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rotary rigs actively 
exploring for oil and gas as of last friday not the number of 
producing wells 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the rig count since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 
per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in 
the rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
among major oilproducing states texas and colorado lost nine 
rigs each ohio was down by three and north dakota was down two 
new mexicos count increased by three rigs and the counts in 
california and louisiana each increased by one

pale columbia toad the wet sprocket 
 
toad the wet sprockets new album pale exemplifies 
everything thats wrong about the wheezing alternative rock scene 
far from the cutting edge the underground scene has too many 
imitators instead of innovators the reigning gods are still 
rem which methodically built a successful career with 
originality and relentless work 
since the early 1980s rem has had more impersonators than 
the late elvis presley toad the wet sprocket is only the latest to 
emulate the form rather than the substance of rem 
pale is loaded with moody slightly incongruous lyrics the 
guitar rock mixes the jangle and the drone the covers a grainy 
picture of something indistinguishable and the band photo is blurry 
sound familiar 
admittedly the failure of an entire genre is a tough burden to 
place on the shoulders of an unassuming california rock band 
theyre somewhat adept interpreters the sound is more muscular 
than murmurera rem though the songs of course lack 
distinctiveness 
but it would be far better to see bands try to make their mark 
with their own visions rather than someone elses

chamber orchestra conducted by jahja ling 
 
rolf smedvig has recorded frequently as a member of the 
superlative empire brass quintet and played six years with the 
boston symphony joining the orchestra at the remarkable age of 19 
surprisingly this is his first solo endeavor on disc its a 
good one his playing has life and spirit and smedvig knows how to 
scale his performance up or down for the work at hand he also has 
a wonderful mellow tone that can even fool the listener into 
hearing an oboe 
aside from the haydn eflat concerto he doesnt have much 
topquality raw material with which to work but then all trumpet 
soloists have to deal with a narrow field 
another work on the program is the eflat concerto by johann 
nepomuk hummel one of historys corrections that is he was 
tremendously popular and highly regarded in his day but has since 
fallen into a deserved obscurity 
his concerto is secondrate and uninteresting yet a staple of 
the instrument nevertheless smedvig calls attention to the 
pleasing moments in this work 
he also displays some beautiful legato playing in the haydn 
andante ling and the scottish players make an excellent 
contribution in this piece and are firstrate in general 
also on the program is a routine baroque concerto by giuseppe 
torelli a nicely tossedoff piece of fluff by a young vincenzo 
bellini originally written for oboe and a transcription of a 
violin concerto by giuseppe tartini 
the last work has a striking andante movement with lovely 
bittersweet melodies it seems destined for plunder by a wine 
advertiser looking for a bucolic soundtrack

in 1889 george eastman wrote to a 
colleague that the potential market for his new easytouse camera 
and film was immense 
there is more millions in it than anything else the founder 
of eastman kodak co said if we can fully control it i would 
not trade it for the telephone 
the story of eastmans millions and his exceptional success in 
the fledgling photography industry is chronicled in the 45600 
letters he wrote and received from 1880 to his death in 1932 the 
letters were donated this week by kodak to the international museum 
of photography at george eastman house it is the first time the 
collection has been made open to the public 
the letters some handwritten by eastman in large looping 
script fill 18 shelves of gray boxes and leatherbound volumes in 
a cellar at kodaks rochester headquarters they provide insights 
into a broad slice of american history from the specifications 
for a pair of carriage horses to eastmans opinions on the layout 
of downtown rochester from turnofthecentury legal and political 
issues to the development of modern photography 
the collection includes letters to and from many of the most 
important inventors photographers businessmen and educators of 
the day as well as correspondence with four united states 
presidents 
there is a 13year correspondence with educator booker t 
washington washingtons tuskegee institute was one of many 
educational and charitable institutions to which eastman donated 
millions of dollars over his lifetime 
another correspondent was franklin d roosevelt in 1927 
eastman donated a moving picture machine to roosevelts warm 
springs foundation for victims of infantile paralysis so that 
doctors could record patients movements 
eastman did not refrain from expressing his strong opinions in 
his letters he vehemently opposed the us governments policy of 
neutrality in the world war i and was exasperated with auto 
magnate henry ford a prominent pacifist 
this neutral talk makes me sick eastman wrote in 1915 to a 
friend in london and as for henry ford he makes me sick and 
tired 
charles apfelbaum a new york rare book collector who helped 
appraise the collection called the letters one of the greatest 
archival collections in america 
the collection was estimated to be worth 750000 but 
appraisers said it could be worth more than 15 million if the 
letters were sold individually 
rarely has the history and development of an important 
technical subject photography in all its phases been so dominated 
by one person apfelbaum said the history of 20th century 
photography is here in these files 
eastman perfected his system of massproducing dry photographic 
plates in 1880 and began their commercial manufacture the dry 
plates were a great advance over the chemicals and water tanks that 
earlier photographers had to lug with them 
the young industrialist who had dropped out of school at age 14 
to support his family spent much of the next decade experimenting 
with lighter and more flexible substitutes for glass plates 
in 1887 a chemist hired by eastman found the emulsion he was 
looking for one that was quick and plucky and keeps 
the new film is the slickest product we ever tried to make 
and its method of manufacture will eliminate all of the defects 
hitherto experienced in film manufacture he wrote to a colleague 
the new film anybody can work he wrote to a dealer it was 
absolutely certain that it would entirely replace glass plates 
at least for amateur work at once or as fast as the goods can be 
made 
by the end of the decade eastman had more orders than he could 
fill at his rochester plant we could do double the business if 
we could turn out the goods he wrote to his business partner 
henry a strong in 1990 
as the company expanded eastman stayed involved in every facet 
of the business from ordering chemicals and inspecting 
construction blueprints to distributing dividends 
my regular business takes every minute day and night that i 
can spare from sleep he said in an 1889 letter declining an 
offer to invest in another business 
eastman was a detail man in his personal as well as business 
life whether writing a furniture maker with precise instructions 
for the design of his piano legs reviewing the medical records of 
his cows giving directions for the cultivation of corn on his 
north carolina farm or ordering his favorite brand of java coffee 
an 1898 letter contained a list of specifications for the 
bicycle eastman was ordering 
i have no use for a brake he wrote i think they are very 
dangerous things 
despite its successes eastmans young company was plagued with 
legal wrangling over patent infringements antitrust suits and 
injunctions to stop former employees from stealing company secrets 
in an 1898 letter written shortly after the american victory 
over the spanish at manila bay eastman commented on the steady 
stream of lawsuits 
everybody here is feeling jubilant over the first reports of 
the manila victory he wrote peace extends only to private 
life however in business it is war all the time

margo timmins was thinking about the house near 
montreal where she lived with her parents and five siblings a 
huge playground is how the singer for cowboy junkies described it 
big rooms high ceilings and a winding staircase in back 
it was there that timmins and her brother michael argued about 
elton john records never dreaming that one day theyd form a band 
of their own 
and it was there that she taught herself to sing dropping 
embarrassing attempts to belt it out like pat benatar lowering her 
voice from a scream to a whisper 
i decided when i sang quietly at home when i was singing 
around the house thats when i had control of my voice timmins 
said in gentle tones at the manhattan offices of rca records 
right from the beginning i was aware that being a good singer 
was phrasing i realized when i sang around the house i could 
phrase a lot better i could twist words i could go up and down 
fans heard her loud and clear purchasing nearly a million 
copies of the junkies the trinity session and critics were 
also impressed frequently placing the album among their 10 best of 
1988 
only the sound men had trouble adjusting 
in the early days i had more sound men cursing at me saying 
you have to sing louder i said no you figure out how to get 
me out there when i started to sing lower and quieter everyone 
became quiet so they could hear me 
the trinity session the junkies second album was recorded 
in 14 hours at the trinity church in toronto costing a tidy sum of 
250 the sound was as lean as the budget blues and country 
chilled by the arctic air of that november day on covers of blue 
moon and im so lonesome i could cry timmins phrasing is as 
dry as powdered snow the words in danger of snapping like frozen 
twigs 
the trinity session was something we worked really hard 
on timmins recalled we had day jobs as well at that point 
and every night we would come together for five months prior to 
recording it we were so focused these songs we knew they were 
good we knew they filled us with something 
it was a hard act to follow impossible the junkies learned 
last spring they went to a wooden temple nearby built by 
quakers in 1830 and recorded their followup record to be released 
in september after returning from a european tour they gave the 
album another listen and changed their minds 
it sounded old timmins said but i think thats when we 
realized that no one was pressuring us to put an album out that we 
could take our time 
when we realized this isnt what we want on this album we 
thought lets do it again and did it in november we sort of 
got rid of that time pressure we imposed and relaxed about it and 
did it our way 
appropriately titled the caution horses the album has eight 
originals seven by michael timmins and one witches by both 
siblings plus covers of fellow canadians neil young 
powderfinger and mary margaret ohara you will be loved 
again 
the atmosphere is filtered through the utterly modern 48track 
digital equipment of torontos eastern sound studio this time the 
junkies are less interested in a single mood than in a series of 
moods 10 different takes on modern love the music warmed to room 
temperature is looser fuller with more of a country feel 
we were aware that some people wouldnt want us to break away 
from that purist way of recording timmins said if we went 
into a studio we knew that people would be mad and if we did more 
lowkey songs we knew theyd say its just the same 
timmins can turn lyrics into snapshots its the kind of night 
where its so cold and you spit she sings in cheap is how i 
feel pausing midway it freezes before it hits the ground 
beds bars cars and mirrors also pop up 
thank the canadian weather and abundance of space for the 
junkies visual approach to music 
i think that we really have a picturesque kind of way of 
dealing with things everythings gray for six months out of the 
year so you better have a big imagination youre locked inside 
and you read a lot 
to me the songs on the new album are stories that have to be 
made believable she said theres a time and a place and a 
message and a mood like short stories thats the way i approached 
them basically because thats the way i read them when mike 
handed them to me 
the quintessential junkie timmons says is shy aloof like 
bassist alan anton timmins insists that shes not shy but quiet 
a big difference approach her at a party and shell talk to you 
all night approach her for an interview and she just might find a 
little extra time in her schedule 
i think there must be a part of me inside that wants the 
attention otherwise i wouldnt allow it to happen i do enjoy 
buying a magazine and seeing my picture 
but there are limits to that if its a choice between 
visiting my mom in florida and getting my picture taken then ill 
see my mom although if i can take the photographer along ill do 
both

opec member nations produced an estimated 
2409 million barrels a day of crude oil in march the highest 
monthly output since 1981 the weekly middle east economic survey 
reported monday 
the influential newsletter said the production was up from 2362 
million barrels per day in february and 2332 million in january 
daily production in december was only slightly lower at 24 million 
the newsletter said iran showed the biggest increase in 
production jumping from 28 million barrels a day in february to 
315 million in march 
it is the first time since august that iran has been able to 
produce at the level of its 314 million barrels per day quota 
assigned under the cartels shared production system 
observers will be interested to see whether their level can be 
sustained in the coming months the newsletter said export 
facilities were severely damaged during the 198088 war with iraq 
but the government made repairs its first priority 
the overall production level was well above the ceiling of 221 
million barrels per day that the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries agreed on for production in the first six 
months of 1990 some members led by the united arab emirates and 
kuwait have been ignoring their production quotas and calling for 
their abolition 
last week the parisbased international energy agency estimated 
march production at 237 million barrels a day 
oil prices soared in january but have been gradually slipping 
since falling in early march below the cartels target of 18 a 
barrel to about 1775 for the average of a basket of seven crude 
oils 
the newsletter said the supply and demand for opec crude are 
roughly in balance

the chairman of general motors corp today warned 
that recent usjapan trade talks could lead to undesirable new 
american laws if current high us expectations are not met 
most trade talks between the two nations have focused on 
improved market access for particular products 
but last weeks negotiations dealt with business practices and 
customs in both countries that have worsened their trade imbalance 
which has stood at about 50 billion for several years 
i am not a japanbasher and never will be said roger 
smith chairman of the worlds largest automaker but we have to 
learn to trade together and i look for japanese companies to take 
the leadership in helping resolve these trade issues we should not 
have governments trying to resolve some of these trade issues 
in the trade talks japan pledged to alter its antimonopoly law 
to provide foreign companies more access to business opportunities 
by reducing japanese business collusion it also promised to reduce 
restrictions on the opening of largescale stores which us trade 
officials say are more likely to sell imported products 
i dont know whether thats going to be good for trade or bad 
for trade because its going to raise expectations but if it 
doesnt produce results to lower that 50 billion trade deficit it 
may backfire in congress and bring on some unwanted rules smith 
said 
he said japanese customs and attitudes have blocked sales of 
us cars in japan and warned that such nontariff barriers were 
dangerous 
i dont think you need those barriers and i think they are 
very dangerous because they are the things that the people in the 
united states hold up as an example and say see you cant trust 
the japanese he told reporters at the japan national press club 
the record 182168 cars trucks and buses that japan imported in 
1989 accounted for only about 3 percent of the 58 million vehicles 
sold during the year the imported passenger cars included 120293 
from west germany 19084 from the united states 14519 from 
britain and 10487 from france the japan automobile importers 
association said 
smith who is retiring in july arrived in japan thursday on a 
farewell visit gm officials said

the gears grind the engine growls and the 
rig jumps a curb bumps into a shiny corvette and rolls over a stop 
sign 
at the hands of an untrained driver a 45foot trailer truck can 
do a lot of damage but in what doron precision systems inc says 
is the worlds first affordable truck driver training simulator 
all the damage is to the ego 
the truck and the corvette weigh only a few pounds and the 
scene out the windows is a fourscreen live tv show 
step on the gas you cant hurt a thing said doron 
president carl wenzinger as a firsttime truck driver took the 
wheel checked his mirrors let out the clutch and attempted to 
back up to a dock at the end of a narrow alley 
doron is the company that builds those futuristic capsules that 
rock and roll a dozen shopping mall patrons at a time through a 
filmed roller coaster adventure a san francisco cable car ride or 
a helicopter flight over manhattan 
but wenzinger said his first and still most important business 
is creating realistic training devices for car bus and truck 
drivers the binghamton ny company claims to be the world 
leader in audiovisual driver training equipment 
this is not a video game wenzinger said we are in the 
serious business of traffic safety 
the company is keeping parts of its new l300 vehicle 
maneuvering trainer system secret behind black plastic sheets 
during public showings until all of the patents are accepted 
but what was uncovered in a demonstration last week was a 
lifesized cab complete with steering wheel and most of the gauges 
and controls of a normal truck two video projectors for a sweeping 
view of the road and two 24inch television sets for side windows 
with inset rearview mirrors 
wenzinger also acknowledged what was not immediately obvious 
until the silver corvette at the side of the road bounced rather 
than crunched the l300s driver is actually controlling a scale 
model which can either be placed in another room or stacked on top 
of the cab the scene includes a cab and trailer mounted with 
miniature video cameras 
it doesnt make sense to tie up an instructor fulltime in the 
front seat wenzinger said 
the whole thing could fit into a large living room the cost 
about 130000 compared to several million dollars for airplane or 
railroad simulators that use computergenerated images 
the difference in conducting training in an l300 and a real 
truck wenzinger said is that the trainee burns no fuel cant 
destroy the transmission doesnt wear out the tires or brakes and 
cant damage the training course 
it also saves on instructors he said one can monitor several 
simulators at a time 
the disadvantage is that the machine cant simulate highway 
driving the model would have to be too big some of the training 
still has to be in a classroom simulator with a movie screen or in 
a real rig 
the first two l300 simulators are to be delivered late this 
month to the pinellas technical education center run by pinellas 
county fla 
i think its fantastic said warren laux principal of the 
schools st petersburg campus 
i felt a lot of anxiety in driving it and didnt want people 
watching me said laux after testdriving the l300 id rather 
have students get those feelings in a simlulator than in a 100000 
piece of equipment they could ruin 
models could be constructed to duplicate most conditions a 
driver might face in turning parking or docking said david 
lindsey director of truck fleet operations for doron 
lindsey said courses could simulate rugged terrain for training 
in military vehicles or a school yard or city street for busdriver 
training

formal talks have broken off between two rival 
groups promoting different versions of atampts unix computer 
software though the groups said they have agreed to certain 
standards 
however the groups said they determined that a merger of the 
rivals could not be practically achieved at this time 
one of the groups unix international was set up by american 
telephone amp telegraph co the other the open software foundation 
was established by such atampt rivals as international business 
machines corp digital equipment corp and siemens ag of west 
germany 
the groups are vying for control of the unix operating system a 
base layer of software that fast is becoming an industry standard 
but different versions of unix have sprung up since atampt invented 
it meaning computers running on one version are not compatible 
with those running on another 
the open software foundation was established by the atampt rivals 
in 1988 when they became concerned that the phone giant was trying 
to retain control of unix rather than allow it to become an 
industry standard 
in response atampt formed unix international and ceded control of 
its versions of unix to the group 
the two groups said in november they were involved in formal 
discusssions on cooperation aimed at ending the perception they 
were rivals 
today they said the talks had concluded but that informal 
discussions would continue among the progress the groups cited 
were agreements to adhere to a number of industry standards

the planned union between west and 
east germany should prevent a west germany economic slowdown over 
the next two years experts said monday but they reiterated 
concerns that east german unemployment could soar 
west germanys five leading economic research institutes said 
increased demand resulting from the economic reconstruction of east 
germany likely will prevent a significant slowdown in west german 
growth 
klauswerner schatz an economist at the institute for world 
economics in kiel said the five institutes expect growth to slow 
marginally to 375 percent in 1990 from 4 percent in 1989 in 1991 
they expect the economy to grow at an almost similar pace 
in 1991 growth should be 15 percentage points higher than it 
would have been without economic union said schatz 
west germany has launched plans to create an economic union with 
east germany on the road to german unification under such a union 
west germany virtually would control east germanys economy as it 
rebuilds its eastern neighbor 
monetary union in which west germanys strong mark will replace 
east germanys nearly worthless currency is a central part of 
plans for economic union 
some west germans have raised concerns that unification could 
prove to be a heavy economic burden 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said monday 
part of the costs of unification could be covered by spending less 
on defense some opposition politicians have said west germany will 
have to raise taxes to cover the high price for unity 
but the five institutes said west german growth likely would 
handle unification costs 
in the midterm tax increases will not be necessary 
schatz said 
but schatz also called on west german and east german 
politicians to take the necessary steps to preserve east german 
jobs as the two nations negotiate the terms of currency union 
east german politicians are pressing for a general 1to1 swap 
of east german marks for west german marks but western financial 
experts continually have warned that could create high unemployment 
in east germany because it would increase businesses debts as well 
as their payrolls 
some forecasts have said 2 million east germans could lose their 
jobs under such a plan 
in their report the five institutes said strong economic growth 
in west germany over the next two years hinges on east germany 
scrapping its planned economy in favor of a freemarket system 
west germanys economic legal and tax systems will have to be 
adopted by east germany the experts said 
schatz said east germany will face enormous pressures during 
the transition to a marketeconomy system but he said those same 
pressures bring great advantages 
he said that after east germanys full entry into a 
marketeconomy system in a short time an enormous production 
impulse will be realized 
in addition east germans will have to pay far less for western 
imports then they do now he said 
according to schatz as east germanys economic health recovers 
that will provide a bonus for west germanys economy as well 
the economic reconstruction of east germany will lead to a 
high need for investment goods which without a doubt will be met 
for the most part by deliveries from the federal republic west 
germany said schatz 
he said east german demand for west german consumer goods likely 
will increase immediately after monetary union is implemented 
which may occur as early as july 1 
the economic forecasts were conducted jointly by the ifo 
economic research institute in munich the german institute for 
economic research in west berlin the rwi economic research 
institute in essen the institute for world economics in kiel and 
the hwwa institute for economic research in hamburg

the us dollar fell monday against other major

group of seven nations 
gold prices also declined 
dealers said early intervention helped send skittish buyers to 
the sidelines 
but the flurry of dollar selling against the yen by the major 
european central banks didnt help the japanese currency because 
the market does not believe the g7 is committed to supporting it 
dealers said 
the finance ministers of the united states west germany japan 
france britain italy and canada agreed at their meeting in paris 
on saturday that the yens recent downswing could have 
undesirable consequences 
but they only said they would keep developments under review 
the absence of the federal reserve until late european dealings 
helped underpin the dollar dealers said but even after the fed 
stepped in selling the dollar at 157 yen the dollar didnt find 
any significant market selling they said 
one british corporate dealer said the market wants japan to 
raise its interest rates 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins

bonds and fostered the explosive growth of junk in the 1980s into a 
225 billion market 
the firm is liquidating as a result of the chapter 11 bankruptcy 
filing by its parent in february 
drexel has whittled its securities portfolio down from about 47 
billion to a little under 1 billion mostly junk bonds private 
placements of highyield debt and equity stakes in companies the 
firm helped finance said steven anreder a drexel spokesman 
the firm is trying to sell its portfolio in an orderly fashion 
to obtain the best prices and doesnt have a target date for 
finishing the job anreder said 
wed like to do it as expeditiously as possible but were not 
going to give it away either he said 
there are 700 to 800 people still working at drexel and that 
number should be cut in half within the next month or two anreder 
said the firm employed 5380 workers before its bankruptcy filing

heinz ketchup will be packaged next year in 
clear plastic bottles that the food giant says can be recycled more 
readily than the squeezable containers it introduced in 1983 the 
company said monday 
hj heinz co officials said they hoped the new plastic 
technology for their ketchup bottles would reduce the flow of 
plastic into landfills and boost the companys already dominant 
share of the 600 million ketchup market 
but some environmental activists said many areas of the country 
are not gathering and recycling plastic containers and said they 
feared many of the new bottles would end up in the landfill anyway 
heinz officials said they planned an educational effort over the 
next year in conjunction with the us conference of mayors to 
encourage development of recycling programs and awareness that its 
containers will be recyclable 
anthony jf oreilly chairman and chief executive of 
pittsburghbased heinz told a news conference that solid waste 
disposal issue leaves food manufacturers with both their biggest 
problem and biggest opportunity in the 1990s 
heinz introduced the first squeezable plastic ketchup bottles in 
1983 and now sells about 60 percent of its ketchup in such 
containers 
but oreilly said the cloudy plastic containers are 
technically recyclable but no economical system has been 
developed for collecting and cleaning them and making use of the 
resins 
over the past several years heinz has been working on a 
container made chiefly of a plastic widely used for soft drinks 
that could keep ketchup fresh the plastic is called polyethylene 
terephthalate or pet 
the new enviropet ketchup bottle which was created by 
continental pet technologies inc a division of continental can 
co inc should start showing up on grocery store counters at this 
time next year the companies said 
the problem with the original plastic bottle according to corby 
mathisen manager for plastics technology at heinzs domestic 
division was that it consisted of five layers bound by an adhesive 
and could not economically be broken down for use in other products 
but the new bottle contains no adhesives and an industry is 
already in operation using pet plastics for a variety of products 
ranging from carpeting to tennis ball felt sleeping bag fiberfill 
and paint brush bristles 
he said more than 300 towns already have curbside collection 
programs for pet containers and said 20 percent of all pet 
products are recycled 
oreilly said the new containers are more expensive to produce 
but the added cost will not be passed on to consumers he said the 
company will make up the difference through reducing costs of other 
ingredients or selling more ketchup 
he said heinz has more than 51 percent of the 600 million a 
year ketchup market up from 45 percent to 46 percent when it 
introduced the plastic ketchup bottle in 1983 
the company plans eventually to introduce the new packaging 
technology for its other condiments and sauces 
allen hershkowitz senior scientist for the natural resources 
defense council an environmental advocacy and research 
organization said the new containers were a step in the right 
direction but he said the recycling industry is illequipped to 
handle the flood of new containers 
of the 200 million of these bottles that will be sold next 
year it is likely that the overwhelming majority of them will be 
dumped in a landfill or incinerated he said 
the heinz bottles displayed at mondays news conference carried 
the word recyclable on the label 
hershkowitz said the use of that term likely would draw 
objections if the recycling capacity for handling pet bottles was 
not expanded substantially by next year 
but mathisen said a healthy portion of pet products are recycled 
and consumers should be told when a container can be recycled he 
also said he had begun talks with appropriate regulatory 
authorities on the labeling issue

the stock market was little changed in slow 
trading today getting off to a sluggish start on a new week 
japanese stocks rallied sharply today rebounding from their 
drop of more than 25 percent since the start of the year the 
nikkei index of 225 japanese issues soared nearly 4 percent 
but little of that bargainhunting enthusiasm was transmitted to 
the us market 
brokers noted that many observers had regarded the selloff in 
tokyo as largely an isolated phenomenon reflecting forces within 
the market there 
since the american markets did not share much in tokyos 
malaise analysts said it stood to reason that they would also not 
play much of a part in the recovery 
in addition observers said traders were reluctant to bid for 
stocks just ahead of the firstquarter earnings reports due out 
over the next few weeks which are expected to show the effects of 
continued weakness in economic growth

executive while smith retires at the end of july 
the united auto workers union called the payments a disease 
thats still in need of a cure 
the auto industry has real and pressing problems but the

received 18 million in compensation last year more than half of

bonus pool for 1990 and transferring 144 million into general 
operating coffers

the former chief auditor of lincoln savings 
and loan who later earned more than 900000 a year working for 
lincoln owner charles h keating jr has refused to testify in 
keatings suit to reclaim the seized thrift a government lawyer 
said monday 
james murphy an attorney defending the federal takeover of the 
55 billion irvine calif sampl a year ago said accountant jack 
d atchison filed an affidavit invoking his fifth amendment 
protection against selfincrimination 
atchison is the fifth former keating employee or business 
associate to invoke the fifth amendment in refusing to testify on 
keatings suit which accuses the government of arbitrarily and 
capriciously seizing lincoln 
murphy said he wanted to question atchison about a taxsharing 
arrangement between lincoln and its holding company american 
continental corp and a june 1988 decision by acc to bolster the 
thrifts capital by 10 million under regulatory pressure 
he asked us district court judge stanley sporkin to consider 
atchisons refusal to testify as a negative inference in 
keatings civil suit 
keating lawyer john lundin said atchinson didnt want to testify 
amid a tremendous swirl of criminal investigations under way in 
the lincoln case 
a federal grand jury in los angeles is weighing possible 
criminal charges against keating the chairman of american 
continental and several other lincoln and acc officials 
as the largest sampl collapse in history regulators estimate that 
risky land investments directed by keating using federally insured 
deposits could cost taxpayers up to 2 billion 
regulators have sued keating alleging that he and nearly a 
dozen associates engaged in widespread illegal acts of fraud and 
racketeering in their operation of lincoln from the time keating 
bought it in february 1984 
formerly the managing partner in the phoenix office of 
accounting firm arthur young now ernst amp young atchison was the 
chief author of audit reports on lincoln later cited by five us 
senators defending their intervention on keatings behalf with 
federal regulators in 1987 
atchison who left arthur young to work for keating at an annual 
salary above 900000 also refused last fall to testify before the 
house banking committee he now works as a private consultant 
keating meanwhile testified monday that he ordered american 
continental to buy 10 million of preferred stock from lincoln on 
june 30 1988 as part of a memorandum of understanding with 
regulators calling for an infusion of new capital to support the 
thrifts risky investments 
although he said the federal home loan bank board gave an oct 1 
deadline for the 10 million capital infusion keating said he came 
up with the money three months early to show our good will 
toward ending a longrunning feud with regulators

the nations major petroleum companies have 
adopted a set of guiding environmental principles their trade 
association announced monday 
but a senior attorney for an environmental organization said the 
11 principles adopted friday in dallas by the american petroleum 
institute sound instead like hollow promises 
the commitments are so vague as to be practically 
meaningless said bob adler of the natural resources defense 
council 
the american petroleum institutes board of directors which 
includes all of the nations major petroleum companies adopted the 
environmental principles in a unanimous vote 
those principles include pledges to promote the safe use 
transportation and disposal of raw materials to address problems 
created by the handling and disposal of hazardous substances from 
oil operations and to operate plants and facilities in a way that 
protects the environment as well as the safety and health of 
employees and the public 
it sounds like hollow promises especially coming from an 
industry that has violated not only government regulations but its 
own promises time and time again adler said 
adler said the industry appears to be seeking to replace badly 
needed enforceable government regulations with more unenforceable 
industry promises 
this industry has said trust me many times in past but has 
proven as many times in the past that they cannot be trusted on 
their own adler said 
the apis environmental principles were adopted within days of 
the first anniversary of the nations worst oil spill in which the 
tanker exxon valdez spewed nearly 11 million gallons of toxic crude 
oil into the sea when it ran aground in prince william sound 
alaska 
the proposals also come as a housesenate conference committee 
considers oil spill liability legislation that adler said would 
increase liability standards for oil spills impose a bigger tax to 
finance a cleanup fund and require better cleanup plans the 
housepassed version of the bill would require double hulls and 
bottoms on tankers 
the oil industry also is seeking to drill in such restricted 
areas as bristol bay in alaska off the florida keys and the 
california coast and at the arctic national wildife refuge 
the industry adler said is facing increasing opposition to 
those drilling plans in light of their recent record maybe theyre 
trying to assure congress and the public they can drill safely 
api board chairman allen e murray said the industry understands 
public concern about the environment 
at the same time we firmly believe that the nation can have 
both environmental protection and economic growth said murray 
who is chairman of the board president and chief executive officer 
of mobil corp 
a preamble to the environmental principles declares that api 
members are dedicated to continuous efforts to improve the 
compatibility of our operations with the environment while 
economically developing energy resources and supplying high quality 
products and services to consumers

the name of washingtons newest lottery 
game may have offended some securities industry insiders but 
wall street got off to a good start monday state officials 
said 
this is official day one and from what we can tell so far 
its going very well said terry massoth telemarketing 
supervisor for the washington state lottery 
the state began distributing wall street scratch tickets 
monday and some lottery outlets already have placed a second round 
of orders massoth said 
players scratch across rows of boxes on the 1 tickets to reveal 
amounts under buy sell and profit if the sell number 
is higher than the buy number in the same row the player wins the 
profit 
prizes range from 1 to 10000 the relatively large size of 
the top prize likely accounts for the new games popularity 
massoth said 
the wall street game offers advantages not found in trading 
on that new york city street lottery director evelyn sun said in 
a prestartup statement players cannot lose more than they 
invested she said 
some strategists on the real wall street were offended by the 
pitch 
its only players who speculate and dont know what theyre 
doing who get killed or sucked in by the market said yale hirsch 
in new york a prominent investment adviser who publishes the stock 
traders almanac 
massoth laughed when told that the name of the new game had 
aroused indignation in stockmarket circles 
they dont feel thats gambling huh he said noting that 
stock market fluctuations sometimes are attributed to such 
nonfinancial events as the outcome of the super bowl 
thats real science he said

the committee representing eastern airlines 
preferred shareholders proposed a reorganization plan for the 
carrier monday that would give eastern to its shareholders other 
creditors and new managers 
the move marks the first time one of the parties in easterns 
bankruptcy proceeding has challenged the airlines reorganization 
plan by submitting its own proposal 
miamibased eastern has submitted several restructuring plans 
since its chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on march 9 1989 its 
exclusive right to file a plan with the us bankruptcy court 
expired feb 20 after the court extended it several times 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami said the airline 
hadnt yet seen the shareholders proposal and declined comment so 
did joel zweibel an attorney for easterns unsecured creditors 
the other major group that is owed money 
the preferred shareholders committee said it filed with the 
court a plan to reorganize eastern as an independent 
standalone airline that would be owned by shareholders and 
unsecured creditors and operated by a new management team 
the shareholders committee had objected previously to easterns 
plan that would have paid them only 10 cents on the dollar 
the preferred holders whom eastern owes about 680 million 
would own 45 percent of the new airline under the plan the 
unsecured creditors who are owed 980 million would get 50 
percent of eastern the remaining 5 percent would be held by the 
new management team 
robert miller an attorney for the preferred shareholders said 
the committee has spoken to several people as possible new 
managers of eastern but he refused to identify them 
easterns unions which struck the airline on march 4 1989 
long have advocated that frank lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp be replaced in running eastern by a special 
courtappointed trustee the unsecured creditors unhappy with 
easterns proposals to repay them only partially indicated last 
week they also would seek a trustee 
under the preferred holders plan the unsecured creditors also 
would receive 200 million in new collateralized eastern bonds and 
50 million in cash they would get another 70 million in notes to 
be repaid from funds eastern might win in litigation against its 
parent texas air and its sister continental airlines over eastern 
assets transferred to them before the strike and bankruptcy 
the unsecured creditors include such aircraft manufacturers as 
boeing co and airbus industrie and jet engine makers like general 
electric co 
courtappointed bankruptcy examiner david i shapiro recently 
found that texas air owes eastern between 280 million and 400 
million for the difference between what it paid for the assets and 
what they were worth houstonbased texas air has offered to settle 
the potential claims by paying eastern around 280 million but the 
unions have said that is insufficient and a trustee should be 
appointed 
if the 70 million in notes were repaid the rest of the money 
from the litigation would be invested in the new airlines 
operations miller said 
he said the preferred holders have discussed their new plan with 
representatives of goldman sachs amp co financial advisers to the 
unsecured creditors 
we would hope that the unsecured creditors would be 
supportive of a reorganization rather than a liquidation miller 
said in a telephone interview we dont want to see this airline 
liquidated 
last tuesday the committee of unsecured creditors voted 
unanimously to reject easterns latest reorganization proposal 
which would give them only 25 cents for each dollar owed a 
majority of the creditors also voted to seek the appointment of a 
special trustee 
however the unsecured creditors dropped an earlier threat to 
press for a liquidation of eastern because they were concerned 
about the potentially negative impact of such a request on 
passenger bookings

new york learjets parent integrated resources inc filed for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in february after defaulting on 
debt payments

subsidiary will assume liabilities associated with learjets 
continuing operations including loans outstanding under the 
companys 38 million line of credit 
montrealbased bombardier designs and manufactures 
transportation equipment and motorized consumer products it also 
has interests in civilian and military aerospace 
learjet spokesman bill robinson said the deal amounts to 15 
million more than the last bidder had offered 
learjet was founded by bill lear in the late 1950s to 
manufacture business jets it currently makes three light jets and 
a medium class model selling for 38 million to 72 million 
learjet employs 2750 people companywide and has annual sales 
in excess of 250 million it was acquired by integrated in 1987 
bombardiers products include rail transit equipment 
snowmobiles and a heavy business jet called challenger jet which

18 million

bombardier plans to keep learjets current operations in wichita 
and allow present management to operate the business robinson said 
in late february another group that tentatively had agreed to 
buy learjet for 60 million let its offer lapse the group said at 
the time that the bankruptcy filing by integrated could hamper the 
deal 
learjet officials said other potential buyers had written the 
bankruptcy court expressing an interest in buying the company for 
more than 60 million bombardier confirmed it was one of those 
companies 
we are in the process of selling a significant number of 
assets prior to presenting our restructuring program to our 
creditors said stephen d weinroth integrateds chairman and 
chief executive officer 
he said the learjet sale will be the first major asset 
disposition outside integrateds former core businesses 
integrated began as a real estate company and expanded rapidly 
several years to become the largest seller of taxsheltered 
investments 
but the taxshelter business was scuttled by the 1986 taxlaw 
revisions so integrated moved into insurance and mutual funds 
financed largely through junk bonds

cbs said monday it acquired rights to 10 
universal pictures 1989 films including born on the fourth of 
july and field of dreams bypassing a decadeold practice of 
selling first to cable tv 
the movies will be shown during the 199091 television season 
cbs said 
the deal follows complaints by mca inc that its movies have 
been shut out of the pay television market dominated by time warner 
inc which owns both the home box office and cinemax pay tv 
networks and the warner bros film studio 
it also culminates a search by mcas universal pictures unit for 
an outlet for popular films that failed to attract strong bids from 
either hbo or viacom incs showtime and the movie channel units 
cbs is pleased to bring the big event of feature film 
television premieres back to network television where all of the 
public will have the opportunity to see them cbs entertainment 
president jeff sagansky said 
cable channels were not disposed to come forth and make a deal 
that was in any way viable mca president sidney j sheinberg 
said cbs and jeff sagansky have shown that they are completely 
committed to attracting viewers back to network television 
terms of the deal were not announced by cbs or mca but the 
network is believed to have paid between 6 million and 8 million 
per film 
the universal films will move directly from videocassette sales 
to cbs 
for the past decade rights to feature films have been sold 
first for video distribution then for cable broadcast and then to 
the three networks 
the pact could foreshadow changes in the way the major movie 
studios and the networks do business with one another analysts 
said 
i fully expect that the networks will be bidding heavily with 
pay tv for movie rights in the next few years said steven 
rosenberg head of rose media corp of pebble beach calif 
earlier this year mca general counsel robert hadl told a 
federal communications commission hearing that hbo had not been 
interested in buying universals films since time inc hbos 
parent acquired warner communications parent of warner bros

california insurance regulators monday 
rejected a french takeover of the farmers insurance companies 
jeopardizing the proposed 21 billion hostile buyout of britains 
bat industries plc 
bat owns farmers group inc and bidder sir james goldsmith had 
proposed to sell farmers to axamidi assurances of france upon 
acquiring bat britains biggest conglomerate 
california regulators ruled that policyholders interests would 
not be served either by a takeover of bat by goldsmiths hoylake 
investments ltd or the sale of farmers to the french company a 
key objection was that axamidi was putting no cash behind its 45 
billion offer 
axamidi chairman claude bebear had agreed to give goldsmith 1 
billion to help with the bat purchase 
to buy farmers axamidi was to borrow 225 billion from banks 
and 225 billion from goldsmith by giving him promissory notes 
goldsmith then was to sell the notes for cash 
while axamidi has an outstanding european record the 
leverage of this deal is such that it would endanger the farmers 
group of insurance companies insurance commissioner roxani 
gillespie said in a statement issued by her department 
the department said axamidi basically looked to the financial 
performance of the farmers companies to repay the acquisition 
debt 
however insurance companies cannot be relied upon to repay 
this type of sizable debt as it would be dangerous to policyholders 
and claimants the statement said 
axamidi spokesman eliot sloane said bebear believed the deal 
could be restructured to win approval from ms gillespie theyre 
raising the issue of leverage and we think we can address that and 
correct it he said 
bebear issued a statement saying the insurance departments 
reservations about axamidis financing were within reason and 
axamidi would press ahead in attempts to address them and win 
regulatory approval 
the statement did not say how axamidi intended to put more cash 
into the deal its officials have suggested in the past that it 
might do so by issuing stock selling noninsurance assets or 
restructuring the deal with goldsmith 
lorraine johnson senior staff counsel to the insurance 
department said axamidi could fight the ruling by asking a 
superior court judge to order the department to reconsider or by 
making a new proposal 
she noted the department had ruled that axamidi had failed to 
meet three of five test standards and hoylake had failed four of 
the five tests 
the problems with the proposal primarily deal with how the deal 
would be financed including the collapse of the junkbond market 
and banks recent difficulty in providing bridge loans 
ms johnson also said goldsmith never has formally presented his 
latest offer for bat since withdrawing an earlier one there is 
no offer there for us to look at she said 
she said bebear had suggested earlier that he could sell assets 
or stock to raise cash but too vaguely to persuade state officials 
farmers the third largest us auto and homeowner insurer had 
maintained that axamidi was too small to take over farmers 
the commissioners decision to deny the applications 
recognizes that the proposed takeover of farmers would have placed 
policyholders at significant risk farmers group chairman and 
chief executive leo e denlea jr said 
in order for goldsmith to proceed with his bid for bat the 
british takeover panel has said he must gain clearance for his 
plans for farmers in each of the nine states in which farmers 
operates an insurance company 
illinois idaho oregon and washington also have held hearings 
on the proposed takeover but have not announced decisions hearings 
began monday in texas insurance departments in arizona kansas and 
ohio have yet to set hearing dates

chinas slumping economy recorded zero growth in 
industrial output during the first quarter although some signs of 
recovery were seen in march 
state statistical bureau figures reported in the official press 
tuesday also revealed that smaller township and private 
enterprises continued to expand while staterun enterprises showed 
declining output and productivity 
industrial output for march was up 14 percent compared to the 
same month in 1989 output in state enterprises was the same as 
last year while collectives showed 07 percent growth township 
enterprises 54 percent and others mainly small private firms 
323 percent 
for the first quarter the industrial output value of 
stateowned enterprises fell 11 percent to 2855 billion yuan 
607 billion and collectives were down 14 percent to 1116 
billion yuan 237 billion 
township enterprises however were up 35 percent and others 
by 304 percent 
combined industrial output in the first quarter was 4158 
billion yuan 885 billion the same as in 1989 
tough austerity measures aimed at curbing inflation and 
unsustainable economic growth brought industrial output growth down 
to 83 percent last year from 21 percent in 1988 
but in the past six months thousands of factories have closed 
down or reduced production because tight money policies have 
deprived them of funds and the suspension of capital investment 
projects have left them without work 
through february industrial output was down 09 percent 
compared to the same period last year the statistical bureau 
report said 
the government concerned about rising unemployment and the 
threat of recession has begun pumping money back into the economy 
but the bureau warned that despite the slight recovery in march 
the industrial outlook for the coming months remained grim 
it said productivity in stateowned enterprises during the first 
two months of 1990 was down 23 percent

insurance companies are liable for 960 million 
in damage and injury claims against owensillinois inc arising 
from the use of its products containing asbestos a new jersey 
court has ruled 
the ruling is believed to be one of the largest surrounding the 
issue of who is liable for claims that asbestos made people ill 
the new york times said in its tuesday editions 
new jersey superior court judge erminie conly on friday issued a 
finding of liability against five insurance companies allstate 
cigna reinsurance general reinsurance united insurance and 
american risk management 
the case relates to industrial insulating materials the toledo 
ohio company made between 1948 and 1958 that contained 15 percent 
asbestos said andrew berry who represented owensillinois 
as a result of the production owensillinois is a defendant in 
thousands of cases brought on behalf of individuals and property 
owners who contend they have been made ill by the materials the 
times reported 
this is the latest and biggest of a series of decisions over 
the last decade berry said 
david daloia who represented allstate and united insurance 
said an appeal was under consideration 
the ruling appeared to be a setback for the insurance industry 
which had recently been on a winning streak in liability cases the 
times said 
companies that produced material with asbestos have been 
wrangling with their insurance companies for more than a decade 
over whether the insurance covers death and illness claims arising 
from longterm asbestos exposure 
insurers have argued successfully in many cases that illnesses 
from asbestos exposure have not been accidental events typically 
covered by insurance instead they have said the injuries were due 
to corporate strategies that knew the health risks but continued 
production
