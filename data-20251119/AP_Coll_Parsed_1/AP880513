the manufacturer of azt the only drug 
approved for treatment of aids reported friday that the drug 
continues to add to the life spans of patients who have used it for 
nearly two years according to a published report 
officials of burroughs wellcome co told an advisory committee 
of the food and drug administration that beneficial effects of 
azidothymidine known as azt or now as zidovudine continue even in 
longterm treatment without an increase in negative side effects 
the washington post reported saturday 
while no study has documented how much time the drug adds to the 
life of an aids patient an unidentified fda official said the 
treatment adds at least six months the newspaper said 
the official said not all aids patients received such a benefit 
from the treatment and that serious side effects prevent half of 
all aids patients from continuing to use the drug 
company officials said occurrences of side effects did not 
increase in patients treated as long as 21 months 
one study of 229 people with aids and severe aidsrelated 
complex found that 58 percent of those who received longterm 
treatment with the drug were alive after 21 months while 50 
percent of those who never received the treatment were dead after 
nine months the company said 
another study of 4800 people with aids and aidsrelated complex 
who received the drug between october 1986 and september 1987 found 
that 73 percent were alive 11 months after starting treatment 
this is significantly better than what might be expected for 
such patients had they not been treated said dr david berry 
vice president of research at burroughs wellcome

paraguays authoritarian government 
has withdrawn its ban on a meeting between pope john paul ii and a 
civic group that includes opposition politicians the vatican said 
friday 
a statement read to reporters traveling with the pope in 
neighboring bolivia said the meeting tuesday in asuncion capital 
of paraguay will be held just as planned 
the announcement came as the pontiff urged bolivians at this 
cocaine crossroads to make war on the drug trade that sows your 
soil with corruption and death 
in lima peru where the pope was due to arrive saturday 
afternoon about 60 leftist guerrillas marching past a hotel 
housing the papal press center stoned and firebombed the building 
friday night police and witnesses said 
windows were broken and a small fire caused by a firebomb was 
quickly extinguished police said no injuries were reported 
earlier this week midway through a 12day papal tour of four 
south american countries gen alfredo stroessners paraguayan 
government canceled john pauls scheduled meeting with the builders 
of society 
about 350 intellectuals businessmen and politicians belong to 
the group which is sponsored by the church and includes 
representatives of unauthorized opposition parties 
paraguay said the ban was for security reasons the vatican 
said it was astonished at the unprecedented step 
according to the statement the reversal was arranged at a 
meeting between paraguayan government representatives and the 
vatican ambassador and local bishops 
in asuncion rene recalde president of the paraguayan lay 
movement group told the catholic radio station caritas he was 
pleased with the announcement and that the hourlong meeting would 
go on as planned tuesday night at a governmentcontrolled sports 
stadium 
marta de colman the groups press spokeswoman said 3800 
people were invited 30 percent of them from the church and the 
rest from social and political sectors among those invited were 
140 members of the government the governing colorado party and the 
armed forces with an even smaller number of invitees being from 
the political opposition ms colman said 
the stroessner government meanwhile announced that only 
statecontrolled television and radio will be allowed to cover the 
popes activities at each stop in that landlocked nation of 38 
million people church officials charged the omission of caritas in 
live papal coverage violated civil rights 
cancellation of the meeting would have marked the first time a 
government interfered with john pauls official itinerary on the 37 
overseas trips he has made since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago 
celebrating an openair mass in sticky heat at santa cruz a 
frontier boom town the pontiff delivered his strongest 
condemnation of drugs on the tour 
the drug trade has become a real trafficking in freedom since 
it leads to the most terrible form of slavery and sows your soil 
with corruption and death he told an audience the local radio 
estimated at 220000 
there is an urgent need not only to protect the youth from 
drug consumption but to combat trafficking itself which is a 
totally infamous activity 
john paul spoke at the citys secondary airport which us 
narcotics officials say is used primarily by cocaine runners 
in his sermon the pope ticked off a list of ills afflicting 
bolivia ranging from high infant mortality to unjust distribution 
of wealth and challenged the faithful to do something about them 
bolivia supplies nearly onethird of the cocaine that reaches 
users in the united states and western europe 
it is prepared in clandestine labs and shipped from hidden 
airstrips dotting the tropical lowlands of this eastern bolivian 
zone near the brazilian border 
santa cruz bolivias secondlargest city with 377000

homes villas and country clubs said to have been built with 
illicit drug money

wineproducing country to speak with children 
crowds surged against police lines to get near him 
the vatican concerned after john paul nearly was mobbed trying 
to leave a santa cruz auditorium thursday night held an emergency 
meeting with local police to discuss crowd control and logistics

enthusiastic bolivians not preventing an attack

five years before white house stargazing 
became frontpage news a georgia congressman claimed that ronald 
reagan consulted astrologers before selecting his running mate a 
tv station reported friday 
wear broadcast a videotape of a speech given here april 30 
1983 by democratic rep larry mcdonald describing how george bush 
was selected as the vice presidential nominee at the 1980 
republican convention 
mr reagan and his wife both are very avid followers and 
believers in astrology mcdonald told a meeting of the 
conservative john birch society its an important part of their 
personal philosophy 
during the republican convention candidate reagan had some 
of the various seers of the stars those who draw up the horoscope 
menus and they had a number of interviews with a whole group of 
them as to what they saw in the stars for the republican 
convention mcdonald said 
and guess what these seers of the horoscope had to say that 
mr reagan would be the nominee and that the republicans could win 
the white house only if mr reagan selected george bush as his 
running mate 
reagan selected bush only days after the meeting with the 
astrologers said mcdonald who was killed five months after the 
speech in the crash of korean air lines flight 007 which was shot 
down by the soviets over the sea of japan 
the reagans interest in astrology was detailed last week in a 
book by former white house chief of staff donald t regan

the internal revenue service is about to get 
some free advice from a group of college students on how to reduce 
the confusion and unpleasantness that go hand in hand with paying 
federal income taxes 
some highlights give the taxpayer a simple checklist in the 
taxform instructions as a final guard against errors get rid of 
the jawbreaking words and please use the word please more 
often 
twenty students at the university of akrons center for taxation 
studies accepted a challenge earlier this year to prove their 
argument that tax forms and printed instructions can be made 
simpler 
the students planned to present an interim report to the irs 
today spelling out how they think instructions for form 1040 and 
form 1040a should read 
our revision of the instructions maes filing taxes easier 
said nicholas creme director of the universitys tax center and an 
overseer of the project it also is designed to generate 
patriotism and positive feelings about the concept of federal 
taxation by gently reminding taxpayers that its the american thing 
to do 
part of that good feeling would be generated presumably by 
replacing the drab cover page of the instructions with a fullcolor 
us map pointing out such landmarks as the grand canyon and new 
york city 
the project grew out of an appearance last march before a senate 
finance subcommittee by creme and several taxcenter students who 
testified about problems encountered while helping lowincome 
taxpayers who had been penalized by the irs 
during that testimony the students cited a readability study 
that found more than half of americans cannot understand the 
instructions for the simplest tax form the singlepage form 
1040ez only 11 percent of people with less than a high school 
education can understand the instructions the law center says 
the students assured the subcommittee they could do better they 
hope to have their revisions of the 1040 and 1040a forms completed 
before july but for the moment they offer these suggestions to the 
irs for cleaning up the instructions 
place stepbystep directions alongside the tax forms the 1987 
instructions were spread throughout the instruction booklet 
reorganize the instructions so that taxpayers dont have to 
read the entire booklet to see which parts of the form they have to 
use 
leave 20 percent more white space and use boldface type more 
often to improve readability 
use simple definitions for technical terms 
include samples of completed forms in the instruction booklets 
list on the first page a tollfree telephone number that 
taxpayers can call for assistance 
since most irs penalties result from mathematical errors 
include in the instructions a final checklist that the taxpayer can 
use just before mailing the completed return 
get rid of multisyllable words and double and triple negatives 
make frequent use of the word please to present a friendly 
tone 
almost anyone you talk to even accountants will tell you 
they had difficulty filing their taxes this year said creme 
now the irs says it is committed to substantially improving tax 
forms for 1988 and we are pleased that we are able to provide them 
with suggestions 
once the students revise the instructions and the tax forms 
they will turn their attention to an even more awesome project 
simplifying volumes of irs regulations and publications that tax 
professionals must consult in dealing with clients

a presidential panel says race should not be a 
barrier to adoption but that homosexuals should be prevented from 
adopting children 
it is preferable to place a child in a family of his own 
racial background the interagency task force on adoption said in 
a report made public thursday however said mary sheila gall head 
of the 13member panel when minority homes are not available 
those children should not wait for long periods 
they shouldnt grow up in foster care because there isnt a 
family of the same skin color for them ms gall said 
ms gall counselor to the director of the office of personnel 
management is a single parent of two adopted hispanic children 
she said one organization suggested expanded rights for gay men 
and lesbians to adopt children but we feel that the american 
public is not ready to give and we are not ready to give support 
for homosexual adoption 
the 54page report devoted only one sentence to the issue 
saying the task force does not support adoption by homosexuals 
president reagan appointed the task force last august its 
report was released after being presented to representatives of 
private agencies at a meeting in the oval office 
ms gall said reagan one of whose four children is adopted 
cited what a special way this is to build a family to have an 
adoptive child 
michael reagan is the presidents adopted son 
the task force said about 40 per cent of the 1 million american 
teenagers who become pregnant each year have abortions of the 
teenagers who give birth it said at least 90 per cent end up 
raising them 
a prevailing view appears to be that if a woman does not get 
an abortion she must want to have a baby and take care of him 
herself the panel said the option which gives life to a baby 
while offering hope to the biological parents and joy to adoptive 
parents is too often forgotten ignored or misunderstood 
the task force recommended that other states consider a law 
adopted in california that reimburses licensed nonprofit 
maternity homes for the costs of care and services necessary for a 
woman under 21 to carry her baby to full term 
the panel also supported pending federal legislation under which 
the adopted child of a retired or disabled worker would be treated 
the same as a biological child in determining social security 
benefits 
the panel included representatives from the white house justice 
department treasury department department of health and human 
services department of education department of defense 
department of agriculture department of labor and commodity 
futures trading commission

close to 900000 acres of national forest and 
grasslands had to be closed last year because modernday 
moonshiners growing marijuana made them unsafe for visitors and 
federal employees officials at a senate hearing said 
william l rice deputy chief of the agriculture departments 
forest service said thursday that marijuana production in national 
forests has become a billiondollar industry since the early 
1970s and is increasingly violent 
he told a senate agriculture subcommittee that 886000 of the 
191 million acres of the government land were closed because of the 
threat posed by growers rice said his law enforcement agents are 
hampered by the legal prohibition against pursuing marijuana 
growers for investigative purposes 
a display of guns grenades and makeshift weapons at the hearing 
prompted sen tom harkin to observe that the marijuana farmers are 
modernday moonshiners but more sophisticated and dangerous 
harkin diowa and other subcommittee members endorsed the 
forest services request for authority to engage in hot pursuit 
of farmers who flee beyond the boundaries of national forests where 
they cultivate their illicit crops 
frank g packwood a forest service special agent for the 
shastatrinity national forest in northern california said 70 
percent of the states 872 arrests for marijuana cultivation in 
1986 were never prosecuted he said the lack of a hot pursuit 
policy was a major reason 
rep ron wyden dore complaining that the 14 billion 
domestic marijuana industry is threatening the quality of life 
all over the west urged approval of his bill to allow forest 
service agents to conduct investigations searches seizures and 
arrests outside national forests where a drug crime occurs 
his bill also would stiffen penalties for unauthorized use of 
fertilizers and chemical herbicides by marijuana growers which he 
said are ravaging foliage and wildlife in national forests 
wyden said oregon has become the third leading state in 
marijuana cultivation packwood said california is the second 
largest producer of the highly potent sensemilla strain of 
marijuana 
in this room there is sufficient space to produce 400000 
worth of marijuana said harkin surveying his small hearing room 
he said marijuana is the biggest cash crop on the west coast 
and that much of it is grown on national forests where farms are 
easily hidden and the law enforcement threat is minimal 
sen wyche fowler dga said hunters campers and tourists are 
risking injury or death at the hands of heavily armed marijuana 
farmers he said many of the marijuana gardens are protected by 
booby traps that can cripple or kill intruders 
wyden said a sheriffs raid on a drug laboratory in southern 
oregon netted a cache of weapons that could outfit a small 
army including an uzi submachine gun two 50caliber browning 
machine guns a semiautomatic rifle 100000 rounds of ammunition 
and 150 pounds of gunpowder 
forest service officials said the growers use of a variety of 
booby traps makeshift shotguns and snarling guard dogs some of 
them trained to receive attack commands by remote radio signals 
these people mean business wyden said 
harkin said marijuana growers are modernday moonshiners but 
these are a lot more sophisticated than the old moonshiners

an antiterrorism bill to ban undetectable 
plastic handguns is ready for a full senate vote after receiving 
unanimous approval from the judiciary committee 
the committee voice vote thursday came two days after the house 
voted 4134 for a similar bill to regulate a potential weapon of 
choice for terrorists in the future 
plastic guns are not a problem now because nobody is making 
them a company that possesses a patent to develop plastic weapons 
red eye arms of winter park fla says its only interested in 
developing guns for the military at this time 
the legislation is advancing quickly without the rancor that 
usually accompanies gun control issues the breakthrough came when 
law enforcement groups heavily lobbied attorney general edwin meese 
iii to support what is now the senate judiciary committee language 
and he agreed 
once it became clear that no existing small metal handguns would 
be banned the powerful national rifle association agreed to go 
along with the bill sponsored by sens howard m metzenbaum 
dohio and strom thurmond rsc 
metzenbaum said he hopes to win a unanimous senate agreement for 
quick floor action the legislation he said is needed to 
protect our airplanes our court houses and our public buildings 
thurmond added the secret service has expressed concern over 
its reliance on metal detection equipment at the white house and at 
other events attended by the president because this equipment can 
be circumvented by firearms with insufficient metal 
as a result the lives of the president and other highlevel 
officials who depend on this equipment are at great risk a risk 
which will be reduced by adoption of this bill 
the senate legislation while aimed at plastic weapons would 
require that all firearms be as detecable as a 37ounce stainless 
steel handgun all guns currently manufactured or imported into the 
united states would meet the test 
while the senate bill sets a dectability standard the 
housepassed measure requires that the gun itself contain 37 
ounces of metal the house bill sponsored by rep william j 
hughes dnj deals specifically with plastic guns while the 
senate measure sets a standard for firearms in general 
the senate measure also would require all guns to be detectable 
by xray machines used at airports 
all federal security checkpoints would have to be equipped with 
metal detectors capable of distinguishing a 37ounce stainless 
steel gun from innocuous metal articles commonly carried by 
individuals 
the standard would require that stateoftheart magnetometers 
be installed 
other senate provisions would prohibit possession of a firearm 
in a federal courtroom and increase penalties for some offenses 
including illegal possession of explosives in airports and use or 
possession of explosives in commission of a federal felony

the three major television networks say they 
will not jump the gun and call a winner before the polls are closed 
in any state during novembers presidential election 
representatives of abc cbs and nbc told the senate rules 
committee on thursday that they would be willing to make the 
commitment permanent if there were a uniform closing time of the 
polls across the country 
all three said they favored legislation to close the polls in 
the continental united states at 9 pm eastern standard time 
during presidential elections 
thomas b ross senior vice president of nbc news said the 
networks policy is to project election results in any state 
only after all polls for that office have closed in that state 
under our policy were a national uniform poll closing system 
in place nbc news would not use election day voter polls to 
project or characterize the outcome of a national election until 
polls in all states were closed he said 
but sen brock adams dwash and rep al swift dwash noted 
that the networks had made the commitment previously and nbc had 
violated the pact during the new york democratic presidential 
primary by using exit polls 
adams chaired the hearing and is a strong supporter of the 
legislation swift successfully pushed through a similar bill in 
the house in november 
swift showed a video tape of the three networks during the new 
york primary april 19 in which nbc indicated mike dukakis would be 
a big winner over jesse jackson even though many of the states 
polling places were still open 
mr chairman i can assure you that it was an inadvertent 
aberration and it will not occur again said ross 
the other two network officials who made the commitment were 
george watson vice president and washington bureau chief of 
capital cityabc news and warren mitofsky vice president election 
and survey unit cbs news 
under the legislation polls would close at 9 pm in the 
eastern time zone 8 pm in the central time zone and 7 pm in 
the mountain time zone 
in the pacific time zone daylight savings time would be 
extended until the sunday after election day this provision 
affecting california nevada oregon washington and the idaho 
panhandle would permit a 7 pm poll closing simultaneous with 9 
pm est 
alaska and hawaii would not be affected by the measure which 
was approved on a vote of 208109 on nov 10 
sen ted stevens ralaska ranking committee republican 
expressed concern that the two states not in the continental united 
states were exempt from the bill 
when stevens asked if the networks would withhold declaring a 
presidential winner until the polls close in alaska and hawaii 
each of the representatives shook their heads in the negative 
stevens who said he believes election day should be a national 
holiday told the panel that he might try to open the alaska polls 
for a few hours on the day before the election and then close them 
at the national standard time which would be 5 pm in his state

it has been a long time since the two 
superpowers have been able to count on their allies for lockstep 
support of their policies and lately there is evidence that the 
breakdown in discipline is accelerating 
the signs of restiveness extend from panama to poland the 
demise of the concept of a bipolar world order has left both 
washington and moscow with difficult adjustments to make 
if the united states finds its allies balkier than before it 
can at least take comfort that the kremlin seems to be in a similar 
fix 
may day used to be cause for celebration in the soviet bloc the 
occasion when the intended beneficiaries of marxism the workers 
showed their gratitude to their system and their rulers 
but this may day polish authorities found themselves 
confronting the most serious industrial strikes since 1982 the 
government appears to have survived the challenge for the time 
being but the unrest once again raised doubts about stability in 
poland and its reliability as a soviet ally 
in panama the us effort to force gen manuel antonio noriega 
to step down is beginning its 12th week the administration had 
hoped to arrange a quick exit for noriega and its failure to do so 
thus far has become a major embarrassment 
recent negotiations indicate a willingness by noriega to resign 
at some point but the evidence suggests that his departure may be 
based more on his terms than the reagan administrations 
underscoring noriegas contemptuous attitude toward washington 
are the gestures of friendship he has been making toward the two 
principal us rivals in the hemisphere nicaragua and cuba 
there are other signs of waning superpower clout 
denmark over us objections may tighten loopholes in its 
existing though widely ignored ban on allowing nuclear armed 
ships to enter danish ports final approval of the proposal could 
end nato military cooperation with denmark new zealand because of 
its antinuclear policies ceased to be a us military ally two 
years ago 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has given up the nineyear 
soviet effort to tame anticommunist rebels in afghanistan and soon 
will begin a troop withdrawal without achieving most of his 
objectives 
spain has ordered the us to remove 72 american f16 fighters 
from its territory another indication of that countrys 
determination to limit military cooperation with western allies 
the kremlins closest ally in africa angola has been unable 
in almost 13 years to defeat a usbacked rebel movement and a 
negotiated settlement may be a prospect prosoviet regimes in 
ethiopia nicaragua and cambodia also face internal insurrections 
while still firmly allied with moscow east germany and bulgaria 
have recently sent top officials to washington as part of what 
appears to be an expanding dialogue previously washington had 
shown almost no interest in these countries considering them to 
have no room to maneuver beyond narrow limits set by moscow 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead said recently the east 
bloc countries are showing more flexibility toward the united 
states as a logical followup to gorbachevs own reformist approach 
he predicted that by the end of the reagan administration the 
east bloc will be a little less dependent on the soviet union 
and a little more oriented toward the united states 
in latin america the united states has not only failed to 
dislodge nicaraguas leftist government it has been unable to 
rally the support of other hemispheric countries for its policies 
contributing to washingtons inability to control events is a 
scarcity of resources brought on by budget deficits and a general 
tendency among many in congress to support handsoff policies 
the splintering of ideological blocs also appears to reflect 
reduced nervousness among many countries identified with one or the 
other superpower about their own internal security 
polls show that gorbachev enjoys widespread sympathy among west 
europeans and even americans 
reagan plans to spend memorial day weekend with gorbachev in 
moscow its a new day when reagan can feel more comfortable 
passing a holiday weekend in moscow with a communist chieftain than 
he can at home with someone who is far more ideologically congenial 
someone like say donald regan

a senate critic of president reagans yearold 
persian gulf policy chided his colleagues for refusing to vote on 
whether they stood behind the administration 
for over a year we have danced around the issue sen brock 
adams dwash said thursday after the senate voted 8213 to table 
his proposal to require a detailed report from reagan outlining his 
policy 
adams plan which he wanted to attach to a pentagon budget 
bill would have given congress 15 days to vote to disapprove that 
policy support for reagans plan would be implicit if there was no 
negative vote within that time 
neither the house nor the senate has formally voted either 
approval or disapproval of reagans policy of having the navy 
protect 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
that policy expanded two weeks ago when reagan extended the 
us umbrella to protect neutral merchant ships if they come under 
attack and seek navy help in the wartorn region 
there have been a number of military clashes between the navy 
and iranian forces the most recent occurred april 18 when navy 
ships and planes destroyed two iranian oil platforms and sank or 
damaged six iranian vessels 
reagan has refused to invoke the war powers act the 1973 law 
that limits a presidents authority to send us military personnel 
to situations of imminent danger reagan as have his 
predecessors argues that the law is an unconstitutional 
restriction on his authority 
adams has been defeated in several previous attempts to have the 
senate begin the process of invoking the war powers law he and 110 
other legislators have sued to invoke the law but a federal judge 
rejected the suit and the legislators are appealing that rejection 
sen john glenn dohio criticized reagans policy as foolish 
stupid but he opposed adams plan he said it might mean that 
us forces would be pulled out of the region 
glenn said if we pull out and the persian gulf falls under 
the domination of some other power then it has become an 
instrument for other nations 
sen john mccain rariz criticized adams idea because he 
contended it would require the president to be a prophet im 
not sure the president can provide a plan given the fluid nature 
of events in that part of the world 
sen strom thurmond rsc said the plan is another example 
of what congress is criticized for you cant have 535 
secretaries of state referring to the total number of house and 
senate members 
another critic was sen john warner rva a former secretary 
of the navy he told adams i think it would be illadvised for 
the congress to single out any particular military operation and 
say on an annual basis that were going to appropriate money for 
that operation

the nations top business leaders today 
offered an upbeat assessment of the economy predicting balanced 
moderate growth this year 
in many respects the economic forecast by the business council 
composed of 61 executives from the nations largest corporations 
was even rosier than the one offered at the groups last meeting 
just before the october stock market crash 
our consultants are feeling rather good about the economy 
they feel better than they did six months ago said john s reed 
chairman of citicorp the councils economic report reflects a 
consensus of views held by the chief economists of member 
corporations 
they predicted that the economy as measured by the gross 
national product would grow at an annual rate of 24 percent this 
year and 21 percent in 1989 
when the executives last gathered for their semiannual meeting 
at this mountain resort they were expecting somewhat better gnp 
growth 3 percent this year however the latest forecast shows 
more moderate inflation and lower unemployment 
consumer prices are seen rising 39 percent in 1988 and 46 
percent the next year compared with 42 percent in 1987 
the executives said unemployment which was 54 percent in 
april would remain under 6 percent through 1989 
reed said the mix of economic growth expected this year is 
healthier than the 38 percent growth in 1987 the economy in 1988 
will rely less on consumer buying and a buildup in inventories and 
more on improved exports and higher spending by businesses on new 
equipment he said 
while reed stopped short of saying the stock crash was good for 
the economy he said there were certainly good aspects to it 
it relieved a buildup of tension in financial markets and gave 
the worlds central bankers room to lower interest rates he said 
the economy and our businesses are doing quite well in spite 
of that problem ibm corp chairman john f akers said referring 
to the crash no one is talking about that anymore 
but some executives said there was a feeling that the economic 
outlook was almost too good to be true 
edmund t pratt jr chairman of pfizer inc said the federal 
budget deficit and the trade deficit remain serious concerns 
the executives said the trade deficit should drop below 150 
billion this year down from a record 1712 billion last year 
the budget deficit was expected to remain disturbingly high 
at 154 billion in 1988 up from 1502 billion in 1987 
many of us continue to feel we must be living on borrowed time 
to be having such good business conditions when the underlying 
fundamentals are so questionable pratt said 
robert d kilpatrick chairman of cigna corp said the budget 
deficit will be the most significant economic problem faced by the 
next president 
clearly nothing will be done about it in an election year 
he said 
the economic forecast was issued at the beginning of a twoday 
conference where the executives will be briefed by reagan 
administration officials including commerce secretary c william 
verity and us trade representative clayton yeutter also speaking 
are sen alan k simpson rwyo the assistant republican leader 
and sen pete v domenici rnm the ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee

former members of the nuclear regulatory 
commission are at odds over a proposal to reshape the nrc into an 
agency headed by a single administrator 
former commissioner james asselstine told the senate 
governmental affairs committee on thursday he favors retaining the 
existing structure of the agency which is headed by five 
commissioners 
properly implemented the commission form results in a more 
open and deliberative decisionmaking process in which competing 
views are aired and considered before reaching a conclusion said 
asselstine 
peter bradford said a single administrator is the wrong answer 
and would not improve nuclear safety he said multimember agencies 
are more open to public scrutiny and more resistant to executive 
branch control and sudden change 
in addition when running smoothly they offer the potential 
that several heads will be wiser than one bradford said 
however marcus rowden testified in support of the 
singleadministrator concept calling the current nrc structure 
seriously flawed 
the commission structure impedes effective agency management 
impairs policy planning and regulatory decisionmaking and most 
important of all it defeats clear authority and accountability 
for agency performance said rowden 
the former commissioners directed their remarks at legislation 
sponsored by sens john breaux dla and alan simpson rwyo 
the bill would reorganize the nrc into the nuclear safety agency 
headed by a single presidentially appointed administrator who must 
be confirmed by the senate 
the measure would also establish an independent inspector 
general to review allegations of fraud and abuse and a safety board 
to investigate accidents at nuclear power plants 
in addition the legislation would give statutory authority to 
the nrcs office of investigations which examines alleged 
wrongdoing in the nuclear industry 
ben hayes director of the investigations office told the 
committee that placement of the office under the nrcs staff 
director last february dealt a devastating blow to morale he 
said all of his investigative staff members at headquarters have 
said they plan to seek jobs elsewhere

the failing ptl ministry is nearing 
agreement on a plan to sell much of its heritage usa theme park to 
a charlotte sports entrepreneur the charlotte observer reported 
friday 
for ptl the plan promises a rescue from imminent liquidation of 
the evangelical empire built by jim and tammy bakker while allowing 
the ministry to maintain control of its church activities the 
newspaper said 
under the plan george shinn would buy all or most of ptls 
1700 acres including a hotel and water park and move his 
charlotte knights minor league baseball team to a sports complex to 
be built at the theme park near fort mill sc the newspaper said 
shinn might also buy the ministry facilities including the tv 
studio church and amphitheater and lease them back to a 
reorganized taxexempt ministry to be called heritage ministries 
the observer said 
the ministry would have an option to buy the facilities and 
would have absolute control over its church functions 
if the plan is approved ptl trustee david clark said wednesday 
its going to be a wonderful turnaround in whats been a very 
tragic situation 
the estimated 100 million plan is contingent on york county 
sc financing the 12 million sports complex which would include 
a 15000seat stadium and a training center for shinns charlotte 
hornets which joins the nba next year 
as part of the negotiations shinn wants state and county 
officials to agree to build a sixlane road to connect the stadium 
to interstate 77 south of charlotte the observer said 
any agreement with the county apparently is still days if not 
weeks away the observer reported the plan also is subject to 
approval by us bankruptcy judge rufus reynolds who already has 
ordered ptl to start liquidating assets 
as far as the ministry my objective is not to take it over i 
just want to assist its recovery in any way i can shinn said 
we would do the whole thing except for the ministry for 
profit and we would pay our taxes 
ptl is being reorganized in bankruptcy court with debts that 
could total up to 130 million including 82 million in back taxes 
and penalties 
bakker criticized the deal saying he would be terribly 
disappointed if heritage usa became a secular center

airlines were warned nine years ago of 
cracking problems in boeing 727 wheel wells boeing co said as 
authorities investigated a 15inch crack that forced an american 
airlines 727 to make an unscheduled landing this week 
the bulletin was issued because of reports from operators that 
they had seen cracks in those areas tom cole a spokesman for 
boeing in seattle said thursday the bulletin alerted other 
airlines that other operators have seen cracks in that area and 
that they should check 
the bulletin was issued in 1979 and revised in 1981 cole said 
american airlines flight 984 lost cabin pressure monday en route 
from chicago to philadelphia and made an unscheduled landing at 
detroit metropolitan airport the 105 passengers and seven crew 
members were uninjured 
american spokesman steve mcgregor said in fort worth texas 
that a 15inch crack in the right wheel well caused the loss of 
cabin pressure 
the cracked portion of the airplane had been sent to the 
national transportation safety boards laboratory in washington 
where investigators would try to get as much information as 
possible about the crack said alan pollock spokesman for the 
agency 
the incident happened less than two weeks after a 19yearold 
boeing 737 flown by aloha airlines lost part of its upper fuselage 
over hawaii a flight attendant was killed and 61 passengers and 
crew members were injured 
american said the two occurrences were unconnected 
both the ntsb and american airlines declined to speculate on 
what might have caused the crack clarke said it was likely caused 
by metal fatigue a weakening of the metal due to vibration 
cracking has become a major concern in the airline industry with 
the aging of the us commercial air fleet clarke said 
the average age of the fleet is about 15 years but that means 
half are older and it is when they reach about 20 years that you 
worry clarke said 
the american airlines plane was delivered on feb 2 1968 cole 
said 
the boeing 727 went into production in 1964

vice president george bush sidestepped questions about 
diplomatic plea bargaining aimed at easing panamas manuel 
antonio noriega out of power as both of bushs democratic 
opponents expressed outrage over word that drug charges against 
noriega could be dropped as part of the deal 
all three presidential candidates were converging today on 
california whose delegateheavy contest on june 7 will wind up the 
democratic primary season new jersey montana and new mexico vote 
the same day 
bush who began a weeklong western campaign swing on thursday 
was dogged by questions about the reagan administrations actions 
regarding noriega who is under indictment in miami on drug 
charges administration efforts to dislodge him through economic 
pressure have been unsuccessful 
ive learned something from experience in this when 
negotiations are going on that are sensitive you dont discuss 
them the vice president told reporters in albuquerque nm 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united states 
was engaged in talks aimed at getting noriega to step aside what 
this amounts to is a plea bargain he said thursday 
fitzwater refused to say whether the united states was willing 
to drop drug charges against the panamanian leader in exchange for 
an exit but administration sources say the indictments would be 
scrapped if noriega relinquished power and left panama for a year 
bush said he favored getting noriega out but declined to say 
whether he would support dropping the drug charges in order to do 
so 
democrats jesse jackson and michael dukakis displayed no such 
reticence on the subject 
we cant indict them one day and exonerate them the next 
day jackson said as he campaigned in portland ore the states 
primary is tuesday with 45 delegates at stake 
its not enough to just say no out of one side of the white 
house then have drug dealers on the cia payroll on the other side 
of the white house jackson said later our childrens lives 
are at stake 
dukakis in washington for meetings with congressional leaders 
said i dont believe you drop indictments against suspected drug 
runners and murderers 
i think before we start talking about dropping indictments and 
making deals the american people deserve a full explanation of 
what kind of relationship this administration has had with 
noriega 
democratic noncandidate mario cuomo too was taking aim at 
bush the new york governor who had appearances set today and 
saturday in california washington state and oregon pledged to use 
the occasion to have some fun attacking the vice president 
bush aides were also on the defensive about what should have 
been a clear campaign boost president reagans endorsement 
formally given to bush at a republican fundraiser wednesday night 
in washington 
the longawaited nod came in the form of three brief sentences 
at the end of a 15minute speech and was seen by some as a 
lukewarm gesture on the presidents part 
bush was at pains to tell reporters thursday he couldnt be 
more pleased with the show of support and dismissed as 
absolutely absurd suggestions that reagan had displayed less 
enthusiasm than the occasion might have called for 
where all this flak is coming from its much ado about 
nothing the vice president said 
the white house also seeking to smooth things over issued a 
statement thursday saying reagan was surprised by news reports 
that have said my endorsement was lukewarm 
i am enthusiastic fully committed and as i have said will 
go all out to make vice president bush the next president of the 
united states the president said in his statement 
jackson battered by a string of big losses to dukakis sought 
to encourage striking paper mill workers in halsey ore with 
words that sounded like a hymn to his own determination in the face 
of lengthening odds 
you cant give up when the going gets tough embrace each 
other and hold out until the morning he said weve got to 
stay together 
jackson lags far behind dukakis in the delegate race according 
to the latest associated press count the massachusetts governor 
has 1597 delegates to 944 for jackson 
as dukakis has piled up more and more primary wins party 
leaders are increasingly coming into his camp he picked up the 
support thursday of senate majority leader robert byrd of west 
virginia two days after winning the west virginia primary 
dukakis has shown his mettle and demonstrated his 
competence byrd said

the new york city ballet in the third week of 
its threeweek american music festival is loaded with new ballets 
and thursday night a juxtaposition of dance styles in a ballet 
created by peter martins was so stunning it became the favorite so 
far 
martins who shares heading the company with jerome robbins 
named his new ballet by the music a practice also of the late 
george balanchine barber violin concerto is for two couples 
merrill ashley and adam luders are principal dancers in the 
company they danced in neoclassic style classical ballet steps 
put together with originality to barbers lovely melody 
kate johnson of the paul taylor dance company and david parsons 
formerly of the taylor company danced as guest artists in a much 
more modern style when kate was lifted instead of prettily 
pointing her feet she would bicycle her legs 
this juxtaposition of styles sometimes both couples danced at 
the same time to the same music in very different ways was 
interesting the second movement became exciting and the third 
movement highly amusing 
parsons danced with the ballerina in a style more modern than 
neoclassic but less modern than he had danced earlier then luders 
danced with miss johnson who became a whirling perpetual motion 
machine sometimes he wanted to walk away from her but she was 
spinning around him jumping on his back waving her limbs a long 
ovation followed the ballet with many curtain calls 
nadia salerno sonnenberg was violin soloist 
another premiere danbury mix to music by charles ives was 
the second premiere ballet of the evening in the new york state 
theater paul taylor choreographed it for the 18 members of his 
company and they performed it one new york city ballet dancer 
peter frame had a jolly solo to ives circus band march 
in danbury mix taylor seems to have organized his own 
version of chaos there is much tumbling rolling and crawling 
about on the floor grotesque spastic and insectlike moves 
diving as though into water to land on the hands and then flip 
over deliberate bumping into other dancers some of it surely is 
satire 
applause indicated the audience liked danbury mix a lot we 
werent thrilled by it but the taylor dancers performed the 
composition with amazing energy

american telephone amp telegraph co and the 
local bell phone companies welcome a federal communications 
commission proposal to lift limits on their profits but they say 
the agencys alternative approach is too restrictive 
members of congress are also concerned about the fccs proposal 
but their fear is that it goes too far in loosening the regulatory 
reins on telephone companies 
the fcc on thursday unveiled a plan to lift limits on the 
profits that atampt can earn on interstate phone calls and that local 
phone companies can earn on their charges for longdistance 
companies to connect to the local phone network instead the 
companies prices would be capped 
the fcc estimated that a pricecap strategy over four years 
would save consumers 16 billion over what they would otherwise 
pay under the current form of earnings regulation 
the fccs three sitting commissioners agreed the proposed method 
would give the companies incentive to cut costs invest in more 
efficient technology and be more innovative in order to maximize 
their earnings 
atampt said it was encouraged by the proposal but expressed 
initial concern that some of the proposed changes could be more 
burdensome than current regulation spokesman herb linnen said the 
company was concerned it might have less flexibility than we have 
now including in lowering prices 
atampt which as the industry leader is the only longdistance 
company under government regulation has been pressing the fcc for 
more latitude in setting rates other longdistance carriers set 
their rates at levels competitive with atampt 
current regulation restricts atampt from earning more than 122 
percent and the local bell phone companies from earning more than 
12 percent on their interstate business the companies determine 
their prices under these earnings constraints 
under the proposal rates would be capped beginning april 1 
1989 and companies opting for price caps would be required to cut 
rates to reflect a projected productivity increase of 3 percent 
each year after four years the plan would be reviewed 
most of the seven regional bell holding companies while 
supporting the pricecap concept said the productivity factor is 
too ambitious 
for the local exchange carriers lecs to break even under 
price caps the commissions plan would require lecs to almost 
double their recent productivity levels bellsouth said in a 
statement 
nynex called the productivity goal potentially unrealistic 
and bell atlantic said it was a very challenging productivity 
commitment 
mci communications corp the nations secondlargest 
longdistance carrier said price caps should not extend to the 
bell companies at all mci fearing an increase in bell charges for 
access to local phone networks said the bell companies control the 
local phone networks and so should continue under the current 
monopoly regulation of their profits 
fcc chairman dennis patrick said the new method would eliminate 
incentives inherent in profit regulation for phone companies to pad 
expenses and use revenues from regulated businesses to subsidize 
unregulated operations 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee and rep edward markey dmass chairman of 
the panels telecommunciations subcommittee said they continue 
to be concerned that ordinary telephone customers will be worse off 
under this new plan than they would be under an intelligent 
administration of the current system 
the fcc first proposed a ratecap plan last august but under 
pressure from congress the commission decided to finetune the 
proposal by adding details commissioners could vote on the plan by 
fall following a threemonth period for public comment

nearly onethird of the american men and women 
who are living together but not married are raising children the 
census bureau reports 
of the 233 million unmarried couples across america some 
720000 or nearly 31 percent were raising children as of march 
1987 the bureau reported thursday 
thats up from 222 million unmarried couples 662000 with 
children reported a year earlier 
in addition the new report on marital status and living 
arrangements found some 155 million couples of the same sex 
living together including 92000 with children that is up from 
147 million samesex couples a year earlier also including 92000 
with children 
a samesex couple could include anything from a parent and an 
adult child living in the same household homosexual partners or 
individuals who happen to share living quarters the census bureau 
does not ask the sexual preference of individuals 
arlene f saluter of the bureaus population division said the 
data in the new study showed a continuation of the general trends 
of recent years with no major corners being turned for example 
the study found 
among children under age 18 nearly one in four 239 percent 
lived with just one parent up from 235 percent in 1985 
there were 130 divorced americans for every 1000 still married 
and living with their spouses down from 131 in 1985 
by comparison figures released last fall showed more than 515 
million married couple households in the nation in 1987 up from 
509 million a year earlier that too has been rising as the 
massive post world war ii baby boom generation forms families 
while the vast majority of the unmarried couples are younger 
people the category also includes others such as elderly widows 
who rent rooms to college students census officials note 
unmarried couples are simply defined as two unrelated individuals 
of the opposite sex who share a housing unit 
of the 1987 unmarried couples 141 million listed a man as the 
householder formerly known as the head of household of those 
395000 households included children 
in addition 922000 unmarried couples listed the woman as 
householder including 325000 with children 
in households consisting of two adults of the same sex 803000 
were two men and of these 11000 reported having children the 
remaining 748000 consisted of twofemale households and these 
included 81000 with children 
the report on unmarried couples found that of the 141 million 
with a male householder 815000 included a woman who had never 
been married 
some 86000 of the women in these households were still married 
to someone else there were 440000 divorced women in these couples 
and 73000 widows 
for the 922000 unmarried couples listing a female householder 
561000 included a man who had never been married there were 
59000 which included a man still married to another woman 29000 
with widowers and 272000 divorced men 
in most of these unmarried couples both partners were in the 
same age group the report found with the exception of men aged 35 
to 44 and men aged 65 and over

republican george bush is painting democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis as an extremely liberal democrat 
who is far to the left on military matters a portrait the vice 
president hopes will help him win the west in november 
at a hightech defense plant in new mexico and in 
militaryminded san diego bush hit the massachusetts governor on 
defense saying dukakis would cause a radical swing in the 
nations military policies 
bush the apparent republican nominee also tried to draw 
attention away from a minor flap over president reagans 
endorsement of his bid reagans formal expression of support 
delivered wednesday night was judged lukewarm by some 
this is what i call a piranha circling in the water over what 
they think is a drop of blood theyre going to starve to death 
because there is nothing there nothing there the vice president 
said in albuquerque nm its totally absurd 
by the end of the day bush was downplaying the endorsement from 
the man he has loyally served for seven years 
people thought all along the president was for me so i dont 
think the specific endorsment means something bush said but i 
think the reagan record or the reaganbush record if you will is 
wellregarded 
on a sevenday western swing to states where he needs strong 
support to win the general election bush talked as if the fall 
campaign had already begun over and over again he referred to 
dukakis and his remaining democratic opponent jesse jackson as 
extreme on defense 
we are going to have a traditional campaignof one extremely 
liberal democratagainst me bush told reporters in san diego 
he planned another hightech plant visit and a san diego air 
show appearence today 
later bush described dukakis as over there somewhere and im 
not just making charges between mcgovern and mondale somewhere 
there on defense 
george mcgovern the partys 1972 nominee called for dramatic 
cuts in defense spending while walter mondale the 1984 democrtic 
standardbearer opposed some reagan military programs 
in speeches in new mexico and california bush aimed at 
democratic defense policies 
we cannot afford a radical swing we cannot afford president 
who opposes every step we are taking to keep our defense at the 
technological edge who opposes the mx who opposes the midgetman 
who opposes testing of nuclear weapons who opposes flight testing 
of ballistic missiles who opposes testing of antisatellite 
weapons who opposes the building of a strategic defense and who 
flirts with the withdrawal of our troops from south korea he 
told the albuquerque rotary club after a defenseplant tour 
at one point bush joked about the endorsement flap 
you may have seen that the president endorsed me last night 
that was a relief he said as the rotary club audience laughed 
its been tough for me trying to keep my charisma in check for 
seven years 
talking to reporters bush said reagans endorsement was just 
greati couldnt have been more pleased 
the white house responding to reports describing the 
endorsement as lukewarm put out a followup statement on thursday 
i am enthusiasticgeorge has been a partner in all we have 
accomplished and he should be elected he has my full confidence 
and my total support reagan said in the statement 
on another topic bush refused to answer questions about a 
reports of a us offer to panamanian strongman manuel antonio 
noreiga that would involve dropping american drug trafficking 
charges in exchange for noriegas stepping down from power 
i favor getting noriega out bush told reporters as he 
toured a honeywell defense avionics plant in albuquerque ive 
learned something from some experience in this when negotiations 
are going on that are sensitive you dont discuss them

a veterinarian who treated henry 
kissingers dog for cancer says he was impressed with the devotion 
that the former secretary of state showed to the dying animal 
i was expecting kissinger to be a little intimidating 
considering his stature in the world but he was just a regular guy 
who loved his dog said gregory macewen a university of 
wisconsin veterinarian 
macewen met kissinger last month for a few hours when macewen 
flew to new york to treat kissingers ailing yellow labrador 
retriever for cancer the dog died last week macewen said 
he got right down on the floor with his dog in his threepiece 
suit talking to him totally flat out just telling tyler the 
dog how much he loved him macewen said 
the dog suffered from a form of bone cancer that spread to the 
dogs spine and paralyzed it 
macewen said an innovative liposome cancer treatment which uses 
the bodys own immune system to attack the cancer may have worked 
had the disease not progressed to the spine 
however the dog lived out its life in less pain he said 
kissinger went to the national cancer institute after learning 
the dog had cancer kissinger wanted to avoid chemotherapy because 
of the dogs ill health and age macewen said 
a former nci official recommended that kissinger contact macewen

an agriculture department marketing expert 
says the drop in world oil and gold prices in recent years has had 
a dramatic effect on the soviet unions trade with the united 
states 
as a consequence the soviet union would much prefer having 
barter arrangements with foreign trading partners instead of having 
to spend its short supply of foreign currency for imports such as 
huge orders of us wheat and corn 
foreign currency is tight for the soviet government which in 
turn has decreased the soviet unions buying power significantly 
said thomas hamby of the departments foreign agricultural service 
hamby now the agencys deputy director of marketing for dairy 
livestock and poultry recently returned from moscow after two and 
a half years as us agricultural attache his remarks were 
included thursday in the june issue of the agencys foreign 
agriculture magazine 
trade talks between moscow and other countries are increasingly 
turning into barter negotiations he said the soviets make it 
plain they are in a better position to exchange their products for 
foreign goods than to pay in foreign currency 
this is a difficult constraint on trade from the us 
standpoint hamby said the soviet union simply does not have the 
ability to supply the quantity or quality of either agricultural or 
nonagricultural products which would make a barter arrangement 
feasible 
hamby said the united states imports only about 25 million 
worth of soviet agricultural products each year while the soviet 
unions imports of us farm products averages around 2 billion 
annually 
this situation has led to continuing soviet pressure to lift 
us import restrictions on soviet furskins and other commodities 
and pressure for mostfavorednation mfn trade status which 
would give the soviet union preferential access to the us 
market he said 
under the mfn principle the united states would grant the 
soviet union the same trading privileges that it offers most other 
foreign trading partners the mfn designation for the soviet union 
has been held up for years because of moscows restrictive 
emigration policies 
these issues are likely to persist in any trade negotiation 
between the soviet union and the united states hamby said 
currently negotiators are working on a successor to the fiveyear 
grain agreement between the soviet union and the united states 
that pact which will expire on sept 30 commits the soviet 
union to buy minimum quantities of us wheat and corn each year 
the soviets foreign currency deficit also has led to 
tradeoffs in what is imported hamby said agricultural 
commodity imports have increasingly faced competing demands for 
highpriority technology such as plant and equipment among soviet 
planners

some new procedures have been designed by the 
agriculture department to regulate the inspection of imported meat 
and poultry including the permanent marking of shipments that fail 
to meet us standards 
each consignment that fails to pass us inspection would be 
stamped us refused entry on each carcass or packing 
container lester m crawford administrator of the departments 
food safety and inspection service said thursday 
this will help ensure that rejected meat and poultry does not 
get into the human food supply in the united states he said 
it will also warn other countries where the products might be 
subsequently shipped that the us has rejected the items 
products that are refused entry must be removed from the united 
states converted to animal food or destroyed previously such 
products were identified with temporary placards and had to be 
closely monitored by usda employees 
the new regulation which takes effect june 12 also will 
eliminate a requirement that products refused entry be sealed 
before being transported in the united states since the permanent 
markings will serve to identify them 
crawford said the new rule also reinstates the practice of 
controlled prestamping in which import inspectors can put 
their passed mark on containers of imported products before the 
inspection has been fully carried out 
this procedure is especially useful at cold storage facilities 
so that meat and poultry can be stamped and samples taken for 
testing and inspection if there are no problems the products 
dont have to be handled again he said if the products fail 
inspection inspectors can remove the marks and stamp the products 
indelibly as refused 
in a related action the agency announced a proposal to allow 
imported meat and poultry to be inspected only at the port where 
the products are unloaded currently the products can be shipped 
across the country to another port for checking by usda inspectors 
crawford said the proposal which will be open for public 
comment until july 12 would give federal inspectors much better 
control of imported products entering food channels in the united 
states

prices for pork eggs and other nonstaple foods 
are rising by up to 60 percent in stateowned stores in beijing and 
shanghai as part of government efforts to phase out subsidies 
official reports say 
food bills of urban shoppers already have climbed sharply in the 
past few years due to growing demand and stagnating grain and pig 
production 
the official xinhua news agency said thursday that state stores 
in shanghai this week increased the price of pork 60 percent and of 
eggs 30 percent 
a separate xinhua report said prices for pork eggs vegetables 
and sugar in state stores in beijing would be raised by 30 percent 
to 60 percent as of sunday it did not detail the increases for 
each item 
pork has sold for about 50 cents a pound in state stores in 
beijing eggs have cost about 25 cents a pound 
both cost more on the unsubsidized free market 
the average urban worker earns about 27 a month 
beijing and shanghai soon will begin distributing monthly 
subsidies to compensate for the price increases xinhua said in 
beijing the subsidies will be 216 for college students and 270 
for workers and retirees 
xinhua said the increases in beijing are expected to add 176 
each month to the average persons food bill 
overall retail prices rose 11 percent nationwide in this years 
first quarter but official reports have said vegetable prices in 
free markets have increased up to 40 percent in some cities over 
the past year 
for years the government suppressed inflation by fixing prices 
for goods and subsidizing the difference between the production 
cost and retail price 
as part of its decadelong program of reducing central planning 
and increasing the role of market forces the government has 
reduced the number of items sold at fixed prices and raised prices 
still under state control 
the state administration for commodity prices said last week 
that the government eventually plans to stop setting prices 
altogether for pork eggs vegetables and sugar 
premier li peng who has advocated moving gradually to 
rationalize prices was quoted by xinhua thursday as telling a 
meeting of mayors from 10 cities that each should move toward 
letting the free market set prices

david steel leader of britains 
centrist liberal party for 12 years has announced that he will not 
be a candidate to lead the newly merged social and liberal 
democrats 
steel 50 on thursday told party workers at galashiels in his 
scottish electoral district those who have urged me to stay 
should not feel let down 
the new party formed through a merger this year of the labor 
and social democratic parties is to elect its leaders in july 
steel said his leadership was the longest in the history of the 
150yearold liberal party except for herbert h asquith who led 
it for 18 years until 1926 and was prime minister from 19081916 
he said he intends to remain a legislator in the house of 
commons 
the liberals formed an electoral alliance in 1981 with people 
who broke away from the labor party and formed the social 
democratic party claiming labor was moving too far to the left 
steel was joint leader of the alliance with social democratic 
leader david owen a former labor foreign secretary 
members of the two parties decided by majority votes to merge 
after failing in their aim to supplant labor as the main opposition 
to the governing conservatives they won just 22 of the 630 house 
of commons seats in the june 1987 general election 
owen opposed the merger decision and has relaunched a new social 
democratic party under his own leadership

the discovery of chemical abnormalities in 
depressed teenagers intent on killing themselves could provide a 
better understanding of suicide and help identify those likely to 
selfdestruct researchers say 
the things we learn on this may well help future tests to 
identify the highest risk for suicides and that can make a 
difference in the treatment said dr neal d ryan assistant 
professor of psychiatry at the university of pittsburgh 
the brains of suicidal adolescents secrete smaller amounts of a 
growth hormone than those of healthy teenagers according to 
research by ryan and dr joaquin puigantich professor of 
psychiatry at pitt 
the study reported thursday at the american psychiatric 
associations annual meeting in montreal is believed to be the 
first to demonstrate neurochemical abnormalities in suicidal 
adolescents 
its not purely a mind phenomenon ryan said theres 
something that goes on with the brain and there are environmental 
phenomena that impinge on that 
earlier studies have found similar abnormalities in the brains 
of suicidal adults although experts are divided as to what 
conclusions can be drawn 
nothing has worked out as a diagnostic tool said irma lann 
a science administrator in child and adolescent disorders research 
for the national institute of mental health 
ms lann called the researchers work interesting but 
preliminary and said further study is needed 
weve made a big step toward understanding identifying the 
risk for suicide but were not there yet said dr david brent 
a university of pittsburgh psychiatrist who specializes in 
adolescent suicide 
youths 19 and under accounted for 2127 of the 29453 suicides 
committed in the united states in 1985 the last year for which 
figures are available according to the national center for health 
statistics about 80 percent of them were boys 
boys and girls are afflicted about equally by depression one of 
the main forces behind suicide more girls attempt suicide but 
more boys succeed at it ryan said 
however therapists may be mistaken in treating suicidal 
teenagers much the same as depressed adolescents puigantich said 
what it study points out is that the biology of suicide may 
be different than the biology of depression he said if so 
there may be treatment for suicidal depressives that is different 
than treatment of patients with depression 
from 1980 to 1987 puigantich and ryan monitored the growth 
hormone secretion of 140 carefully selected adolescents ranging in 
age from 12 to just under 18 the tests were conducted while the 
subjects slept 
most growth hormone secretion occurs during sleep especially 
during the first several hours ryan said at least three 
neurotransmitter systems in the brain are involved in controlling 
sleep growth hormone secretion which also affects moods 
thirtyfour youngsters who suffered from major depression and 
had attempted suicide or devised a suicide plan secreted less 
growth hormone than 40 depressed but nonsuicidal students and 66 
healthy children whose levels were about the same ryan said the 
subjects sex was not a factor 
later 43 students were given a shot of desipramine an 
antidepressant known to stimulate the release of growth hormone 
eight depressed suicidal youths who received the shot had less 
growth hormone released than the 12 depressed but nonsuicidal 
students and 23 healthy adolescents ryan said 
puigantich said the research definitely can help in 
prevention especially if we can know ahead of time who are at the 
greatest risk

a 126 million fine against united airlines 
is among the nearly 65 million in penalties the federal aviation 
administration says it wants to impose on airlines for alleged 
safety and security violations 
fifteen of the nations airlines face the penalities which have 
been proposed in letters from the faa if an airline can show a 
charge is unfounded the fine can be reduced 
chicagobased united is targeted for the biggest fine the next 
highest proposed fine is against hawaiian airlines 117 million 
followed by continental 982130 eastern airlines 893500 
braniff 518000 american airlines 421250 and northwest 
airlines 371000 
the other airlines listed in the faas documents and the 
proposed fines are pan am 264500 usair 166100 delta 
147250 midway 128000 twa 118000 southwest 56500 
america west 1500 and alaska 1000 
according to the faa 705850 of the fine pending against 
united was imposed after the airline removed vaporseal covers from 
the wings of its 19plane fleet of 767s for about a month the 
covers the agency said in its letter to united are supposed to 
vent leaked fuel from the wing without them the faa said there 
is a risk of fire 
a spokesman for united dan sheehy said it was too soon to 
discuss the proposed penalties publicly because they are 
currently being discussed between united and the faa it really 
would be inappropriate to comment further 
the faa said a major part of hawaiians proposed fine was 
prompted by the airlines alleged delay in replacing a damaged 
sleeve on a dc9s wheel and brake assembly a spokesman for 
hawaiian could not be reached immediately for comment 
continental meanwhile faces more than 200000 in proposed 
fines for allegedly failing to comply with several 1987 
airworthiness directives requiring inspections of engines and 
pressure bulkheads on a leased boeing 727 
bruce hicks a spokesman for continental said the airline is 
seeking to have some of its 982130 in fines reduced but he didnt 
know specifically which fines were being contested

none of the leaders of the countrys 14 legally registered 
political parties was involved

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis is criticizing the administrations reported deal 
to dismiss charges against panamas military leader saying i 
dont believe you drop indictments against suspected drug runners 
and murderers 
dukakis was beginning his first full day of west coast 
campaigning today with events across california after stopping 
briefly in portland thursday night tuesdays contest in oregon is 
a prelude to his final round of primaries against jesse jackson on 
june 7 in california and new jersey 
holding a long lead in delegates going into the final few 
primaries dukakis continued to focus on the reagan administration 
as he reacted to reports the administration had offered to drop 
federal drugtrafficking charges against panamas gen manuel 
antonio noriega if he would step down as the countrys leader 
i think before we start talking about dropping indictments and 
making deals the american people deserve a full explanation of 
what kind of relationship this administration has had with 
noriega dukakis said 
i dont believe you drop indictments against suspected drug 
runners and murderers dukakis said earlier before arriving in 
oregon 
dukakis continued the criticism during his brief stop in 
portland he also jabbed at reagan over recent disclosures that the 
presidents schedule has been guided through the use of astrology 
by his wife nancy 
eight months from now the reagan era will be over dukakis 
said at a mock political convention by oregon high school students 
america will have a new president well be putting away our 
horoscopes 
as he increasingly turns his criticism on the republicans and 
their expected nominee vice president george bush dukakis has 
made a common theme of challenging the administration for dealing 
quietly with the panamanian strongman 
bush democrats contend should have had knowledge of noriega 
going back to the vice presidents days as head of the cia and 
more recently as head of an administration task force to stop 
illegal drug smuggling 
noriega and us officials have been negotiating in recent 
months to solve the problem posed by his continued position of 
power in the face of us indictments alleging deep involvement in 
largescale drug operations 
noriegas continuing presence has been regarded as an 
embarrassment for the administration and a political problem for 
bush 
the administration got into this soup it isnt going well 
and it looks to me as if theyre desperate to get out of it 
dukakis said 
dukakis made the comments as he devoted much of the day to 
making the rounds of democratic congressional leaders in washington 
sessions in keeping with his role as likely party nominee and 
aimed at assuring capitol hill democrats he wants to cooperate 
in the process he picked up the endorsement of senate majority 
leader robert byrd dukakis overwhelmingly won this weeks 
presidential primary in west virginia byrds home state he was 
also endorsed by house ways and means chairman dan rostenkowski 
dill 
byrd said dukakis had run a positive campaign that would help 
the party unite he said it was time for democrats to gather around 
the massachusetts governor as its standard bearer for the fall 
he has not dipped into the trough and gone negative byrd 
said we need to begin to close ranks and thats what were 
doing today 
dukakis also met with house speaker jim wright who refused to 
answer when asked if he was endorsing the governor when asked 
wright responded in spanish with what amounted to a no comment 
dukakis also met with house majority leader tom foley dwash 
who also withheld an endorsement when asked about foley as a 
running mate dukakis smiled and turned to him with the same 
question he once put to jackson when they shared a stage and the 
same question arose are you interested in it 
foley smiled but made no audible reply

general electric co has become the pentagons 
prime design contractor for an initial star wars missile defense 
system receiving a 2359 million contract for five years of 
research 
the award announced thursday is one of the largest star wars 
contracts to date under the contract ges aerospace division in 
philadelphia will oversee research work on the five key 
technologies now being considered for a star wars system 
the award capped a fivemonth competition that pitted ge against 
general dynamics corp the competition was limited to companies 
that were not working as prime contractors on the five technologies 
identified for an initial star wars system 
both ge and general dynamics were judged technically competent 
to perform the work but ge had a lower bid the pentagon indicated 
the star wars program known formally as the strategic defense 
initiative is an effort to develop lasers and other exotic weapons 
that could be deployed in space and on the ground to automatically 
shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the united states or its 
allies 
last september thendefense secretary caspar w weinberger 
selected five technologies for accelerated research saying they 
would form the core of any initial star wars system if proven 
feasible 
they consist of two different types of satellite surveillance 
and tracking systems two different interception or rocket 
weapon systems and a battle managementcommand control and 
communications system the computer brains of any star wars 
defense 
ge will be expected to coordinate the work being done on those 
five projects for example it would set the performance standards 
for each component in order to satisfy the military requirement 
to intercept a certain percentage of targets the pentagon said 
ge also will play a particularly crucial role in the work on the 
battle management system because it will be asked to design the 
functions to assist in the selection of algorithms network 
concepts computer processors and software the pentagon added 
ge already has assembled a team of subcontractors to assist in 
the work and will establish a systems engineering and 
integration office in northern virginia near the pentagon the 
defense department said 
the subcontractors include the science applications 
international corp of mclean va atampt federal systems division 
in greensboro nc the nichols research corp of huntsville 
ala the mcdonnell douglas astronautics co of huntington beach 
calif and the computer science corps defense systems division

broadway the street of sleaze and 
striptease that has carried on the citys bawdiest barbary coast 
traditions has become the target of shopkeepers and cultural 
groups who want to peel away its seedy image 
several new restaurants are scheduled to open and a restored 
theater plans to offer chamber music dance and opera alongside the 
blinking neon lights of the avenues notorious topless clubs 
restaurateur enrico banducci who watched the swing era crowd 
the beatniks and the hippies pass through in his four decades on 
broadway remembers when the north beach district street was lined 
with thriving cafes and nightclubs 
there was a great feeling and great smells on the street 
recalled banducci 66 now you just smell the street and that 
isnt very nice 
but walter pastore of the north beach chamber of commerce says 
merchants are now showing that broadway is on an upswing we have 
many many new businesses coming into the area and investing 
hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars 
its an important area for the city and people are trying to 
bring it back to life he said thursday 
the citys north beach area was the 19th century waterfront 
known as the barbary coast a place to go for whiskey during 
prohibition and a onetime beatnik neighborhood san franciscans 
and tourists still love it for its history and its remaining 
bookstores coffee houses and italian bakeries 
in 1964 broadway which runs through north beach gained 
national notoriety when several clubs announced they would offer 
topless dancing two years later they turned the idea upside down 
and introduced bottomless dancing 
for several years the clubs and sex shops on the nowgaudy 
street flourished drawing curious tourists with neon signs and 
barkers 
but eventually the novelty of nudity wore off and fewer 
tourists visited broadway 
at one time this was all new said a barker outside the 
hungry i who calls himself rocky raccoon 
now you can go to someones backyard and see topless dancing 
people dont have to come to san francisco anymore thats why the 
clubs are dying he said 
raccoon 36 one of the few barkers left on broadway stood 
quietly in front of the club that offers a live exotic strip 
revue 
more aggressive barkers along with shops displaying sex 
gadgets is the main reason for broadways decline in the 1980s 
banducci believes 
people just would not walk down this street because of barkers 
reaching out grabbing at them and yelling at them we all suffered 
from it he said 
in recent years several topless clubs have closed and the 
strip has been plagued by vandalism teenage rowdies and 
competition from new chic nightclubs in the south of market street 
area 
the remaining topless clubs probably are threatened by the new 
restaurants and theaters moving into the area said marsha garland 
of the chamber of commerce 
its an old idea you cant keep the format going for 30 
years she said as leases turn over i think youll see other 
businesses taking their place 
but banducci doesnt think so 
i think we can all exist and get along fine i think we can 
coexist beautifully he said 
everyone is concerned about broadway but to clean it up 
entirely is a misnomer you cant do that he said its a fun 
street its been a fun street for the last 150 years

a 450pound siberian tiger that smashed through a 
reinforced window at the houston zoo and killed a zookeeper poses 
no threat to visitors and wont be destroyed officials say 
we can contain that cat zoo director john werler said 
thursday following zookeeper ricardo tovars death the first of 
its kind at the zoo 
the big cat apparently broke through a 2footsquare 
quarterinchthick glassandwire mesh window in a door then 
dragged tovar 59 into its natural habitat area and mauled him to 
death werler said 
tovar a 10year zoo employee had apparently been peering 
through the window from a hallway there were no witnesses to the 
attack and it was unclear how long it had gone undiscovered 
tovars shift began at 6 am 
john gilbert senior zookeeper of cats said he realized that 
something was wrong around 745 am when he called to tovar and 
the tiger reared up and put his face into the door he radioed 
for help 
a response team headed by curator of exhibits tom dieckow 
arrived five minutes later 
dieckow said he fired a shot from his rifle which made the 
animal drop tovar he fired two more shots in an effort to scare 
the 11yearold cat away from the zookeepers body 
workers were finally able to force the animal back into its cage 
with a fire extinguisher dieckow said 
it cut him tovar up and ate him up pretty good fire 
department paramedic howard shaw said adding that much of tovars 
left arm was torn away he had numerous bites about him and 
possibly a broken neck 
the tiger named miguel will not be destroyed because it is a 
member of an endangered species werler said 
werler said the animal is aggressive it snarls and growls and 
we have some cats that have neither of those dispositions he 
said 
tovar had been in charge of large cats since 1985 
he was very competent he knew his job said nelson herwig 
a friend of tovar and curator of the zoo aquarium for 10 years 
the tiger display which houses two other siberian tigers was 
closed to the public thursday 
visitors including hundreds of school children were delayed 
entrance into the zoo by 30 minutes 
lots of parents have been calling saying their children are 
at the zoo with their school and want to make sure everything is 
all right said cathy kuntz a zoo secretary 
werler said the tiger posed no threat to the public because it 
would have to get through three doors to reach visitors 
the siberian tiger is the largest of eight kinds of tigers it 
can measure up to 13 feet and weigh as much as 720 pounds

carrie is not quite bad enough to be good 
this trashy hightech pop musical version of stephen kings 
horror novel which opened thursday at broadways virginia theater 
vacillates between seriousness and schlock 
eventually it settles for schlock but only after trying to make 
something important out of kings blooddrenched drama of a 
demented ultrareligious mother and her disturbed telekinetic 
daughter its highflying intentions crash 
kings novel is a story of teenage vindictiveness and revenge 
but it had a clinical hardedged quality that escapes the musical 
this show would need the lunacy of a charles ludlum to cut through 
kings hooey and pyschobabble 
what it gets from director terry hands is a sobriety that is 
often unintentionally funny and a cold glittering production full 
of stark white scenery laser beams hydraulic lifts and enough 
fake blood to fill the red sea surprisingly the special effects 
are rather tame 
carrie gets to teletransport a few small objects like a 
hairbrush and a pair of shoes but theres nothing to suggest the 
orgy of destruction she conjures up for the musicals finale 
the story sketchily adapted by lawrence d cohen is a 
cinderella tale gone sour bovine little carrie white is humiliated 
at the ball in this case a high school prom and turns everybody 
else into a pumpkin with deadly results 
the girl has been tormented by her female classmates the 
oldestlooking high school students this side of betty and 
veronica they make fun of her innocence particularly when she has 
her first menstrual flow during gym class and believes she is dying 
carries mother is not too keen on her daughters sexual 
awakening either believing it to be a curse for her own loveless 
marriage she keeps urging her daughter to get down and pray they 
spend a lot of the evening on their knees 
mother and daughter get into a big confrontation after carrie is 
invited to the prom by tommy the schools most popular boy tommy 
has been put up to this good deed by his girlfriend sue who has 
been feeling guilty about the way she treated carrie 
thats not the case with chris the meanest girl in town she 
plots with her boyfriend to dump a bucket of pigs blood on carrie 
during the prom thats the occasion for something called out for 
blood which may be the only dance number in broadway musical 
history that mimes the slaughtering of a pig 
the dances are the work of debbie allen broadways last sweet 
charity and a star of the television series fame her 
choreography is more aerobic than inspired but then the music she 
is given to work with doesnt exactly move michael gores melodies 
are soft rock soft to the point of mush while the lyrics by dean 
pitchford when they can be understood celebrate the simpleminded 
what gives carrie its occasional moments of conviction are 
the performances of betty buckley and an appealing 17yearold 
named linzi hateley who plays the title role the girl sings her 
heart out miss hateley has a warm strong voice and acts with an 
authority that belies her experience 
buckley as that monster of a mother matches the young 
performers singing note for note the best part of the show is 
their opening duet entitled open your heart you believe them 
after the two leading ladies the quality of the cast collapses 
former pop star darlene love is wasted as the sympathetic gym 
teacher who befriends carrie paul gyngell personifies blandness as 
the girls wouldbe prince charming and charlotte damboises 
villainous chris borders on parody 
the settings by ralph koltai are of the cecil b demille school 
big but not necessarily better particularly a giant white 
staircase that materializes for the plays last scene alexander 
reids costumes fit for an outer space version of grease are 
remarkably unflattering particularly for the women 
but the lighting done by director hands is startling simple 
direct and effective 
thats something the musical isnt for a horror story the show 
gets more giggles than screams and cant touch such grand guignol 
as stephen sondheims sweeney todd the ultimate in unnerving 
song and dance 
carrie comes to broadway courtesy of the royal shakespeare 
company which tried out the show at its home in stratford england 
before coming to new york the cast is half american and half 
british a mixture that required special approval from the actors 
unions in both countries maybe next time they will insist on a 
better show 
other reviews 
frank rich of the new york times wrote that the film version of 
carrie was scary funny and sexy pulp entertainment because 
it portrayed the materials thrills wit and postpubescent 
sensuality well 
the musical carrie fails in all these areas he concluded 
howard kissel in the daily news wrote that the show makes no 
more sense than 2 hours of mtv which of course is what it looks 
like 
he called the show disgusting and added there is enough 
gratuitous vulgarity in carrie that i wouldnt send a child 
but in the new york post clive barnes called the show a 
strong effective and remarkably coherent piece of terrific total 
theater a schematic morality play replete with the forces of 
good and evil to say nothing of a cathartic finale of biblical 
proportions

the unraveling of a second genetic code 
essential to producing the chemicals of life is important because 
it provides a striking example of natures logic says a researcher 
who helped decipher the code that baffled scientists for two 
decades 
it looks like an elegantly simple logic thats remained 
obscure for all these years but i think were finally getting a 
handle on it said paul schimmel a biochemist at the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
its a spectacular example of biological logic or the logical 
system that nature uses he said in a telephone interview 
thursday 
while the practical applications are remote the breakthrough 
represents a major step in providing scientists with new forms of 
genetic engineering in addition they expect to identify some 
inherited disorders caused by mistakes in the second code 
schimmel reported taking the first step toward deciphering the 
code which governs the the final assembly of proteins in cells 
his findings were described thursday in nature a british 
scientific journal 
alexander rich an mit biologist unconnected with the research 
said the important thing in schimmels discovery is that the 
results are strikingly simple most researchers would have 
guessed that a more complex code was needed he said 
the original genetic code was deciphered in 1961 researchers 
found that the sequence of distinct chemical subunits in the 
genetic material dna deoxyribonucleic acid determined which 
protein would be made by that gene 
change the dna sequence and youd change the protein by 
changing its sequence of chemical subunits 
dna doesnt make proteins directly however it hands off its 
instructions to a chemical called messenger rna which in turn 
passes the information to a third chemical called transfer rna 
the transfer rna then uses the second genetic code to actually 
assemble proteins from their amino acid building blocks 
the discovery of the original genetic code led to the field of 
genetic engineering in which scientists alter the genetic material 
of cells in order to create proteins such as those used as 
medicines 
researchers had searched for the key to the second code since 
the first one was deciphered and many abandoned their efforts 
after repeated failures 
schimmel and his mit colleague yaming hou broke the code for 
the amino acid called alanine each molecule of transfer rna is 
coded for one of the 20 amino acids 
the dna and rna molecules are made up of subunits called base 
pairs the mit researchers found to their surprise that the code 
for alanine was carried in a single base pair on the alanine 
transfer rna molecule 
it should now be a straightforward process to decipher the 
transfer rna codes for the remaining 19 amino acids schimmel said 
minor errors in this second genetic code might give rise to 
disease schimmel said deciphering the code could help doctors 
understand and possibly treat such diseases he said 
any errors in this system if they occur to a significant 
extent are lethal schimmel said the proteins would all be 
scrambled 
the importance of the finding lies primarily in its elucidation 
of a longstanding biological mystery however not in any 
shortterm practical applications he said

angry friends and relatives gathered to 
remember the 11 people who died three years ago today after a 
police helicopter bombed the house of the radical group move 
sparking a fire that engulfed a city block 
what we have seen is the worst that we can see in mankind 
said andino ward the father of one of two survivors from the 
house michael moses ward 16 
ward was among 100 people thursday at the tindley temple united 
methodist church where the mood was tinged with sorrow but marked 
more by anger and resentment over what some see as inaction in 
addressing the conduct of city officials during the may 13 1985 
confrontation 
events scheduled to mark the anniversary include a candlelight 
ceremony today at 527 pm the exact time of the bombing panel 
discussions and a public forum on saturday 
ward told the group to make sure their children keep forever 
in their hearts the doctrine of the preservation of human life 
wards former wife rhonda died in the house which was 
destroyed by fire along with 60 other homes after police dropped a 
bomb on the move headquarters in an effort to end the confrontation 
with the radical group 
the battle began when police went to the move house in search of 
four people named in arrest warrants firefighters aimed their 
water cannons at a bunker move members had built on their roof and 
police fired tear gas 
after gunshots were fired at police from inside the move house 
a satchel containing explosives was dropped from a helicopter onto 
the roof in an attempt to destroy the bunker 
a grand jury that investigated the confrontation for two years 
released a report last week blasting city officials for morally 
reprehensible behavior however no criminal charges were 
recommended 
louise james whose brother and son died in the move house told 
those gathered thursday that a commitment to prevent similar 
tragedies was meaningless without action to punish those in 
charge during the standoff 
future resolution without present accountability is as 
undigestible to me and my family as the murder of 11 innocent 
lives said mrs james sister of move founder john africa 
there is something very wrong here and until steps are taken 
to correct it we cannot move on mrs james said to applause 
and words of encouragement from several in the crowd

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and other 
iranian leaders cast their votes in tehran today in the second and 
final round of balloting in parliamentary elections irans 
official news agency reported 
khomeini voted in a mobile polling booth outside his heavily 
guarded residence in the north tehran suburb of jamaran an hour 
after voting began at 7 am 1130 pm edt thursday the 
official islamic republic news agency said 
the report came as rumors swept the hong kong stock market that 
khomeini 87 and reported to have been in poor health for some 
time had died 
irna monitored in nicosia gave no indication of khomeinis 
physical appearance when he cast his ballot 
the first round of voting april 8 in which khomeini also 
participated elected 188 of the 270 deputies in the majlis or 
parliament 
at stake in todays runoff are the other 82 electoral 
districts including 16 of the 30 in tehran polls close at 5 pm 
930 am edt 
irna gave no indication of how many of irans estimated 22 
millionstrong electorate were involved in todays voting and did 
not mention turnout 
but it said that parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who 
polled more than 13 million votes in the april 8 round 
prosecutorgeneral hojatoleslam mohammad musavi khoeiniha and 
officials from khomeinis office cast their votes in jamaran after 
the aging revolutionary patriarch 
president ali khamenei and prime minister hussein musavi voted 
in south tehran mosques which were being used as polling stations 
irna said 
they later joined marches in the capital to mark qods or 
jerusalem day held on the last friday of the holy moslem fasting 
month of ramadan 
this was the third parliamentary election since khomeinis 
islamic revolution toppled the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi in 
1979 
aprils balloting was held amid iraqi missile and air attacks on 
iranian cities both sides in the 7yearold persian gulf war have 
observed a truce in the socalled war of the cities since april 
21 
major military setbacks in recent weeks have increased tensions 
in iran 
among those setbacks were the loss of the faw peninsula in 
southern iraq recaptured by the iraqis april 18 after a 26month 
iranian occupation and naval clashes in the gulf the same day in 
which the us navy sank or crippled six iranian vessels 
in the aftermath of those defeats radicals and moslem 
extremists were expected to widen the seizeable gains they made in 
the first round of voting several leading conservatives lost their 
seats then 
but the main election issues have been economic and social 
reform 
the composition of the new majlis which will sit for four 
years will have considerable influence on the direction that the 
islamic revolution will take and on who will succeed khomeini 
the radicals seek centralized state control of the economy and 
broadening of reforms 
the conservatives including fundamentalist clerics are 
supported by the bazaaris the weathy merchant class that has 
survived the revolution and believes in a capitalist system 
the conservatives have lost out rather badly noted philip 
robbins an iran specialist with the royal institute of 
international affairs in london 
the new majlis looks like being a far more radical body than 
it was before particularly on the important issue of economic 
policy he said in a telephone interview 
rafsanjani considered the most powerful figure in iran after 
khomeini appears to be one of the bigger winners in the election 
he supports major reforms that have long been blocked by the 
conservativedominated council of guardians a watchdog body that 
has the power to veto majlis legislation considered to violate 
islamic tenets 
the radicals will bolster rafsanjanis position 
considerably robbins noted 
khomeini who also favors economic reforms and wants to see the 
revolution set on a firm course before he dies gave the radicals a 
big boost before the april voting 
he delivered a series of edicts widening state powers that 
opened the way for reformist legislation vetoed by the 13member 
council of guardians 
the radicals got another shot in the arms thursday when tehran 
radio rebroadcast an announcement khomeini made before the april 8 
poll 
people must vote for the best candidates those who have 
tasted the sour taste of poverty and misery those who are the true 
representatives of the poor and deprived of the world not those 
who represent the islam of the rich the capitalists the arrogant 
the opportunists i mean the islam of the americans he said 
although the majlis does not control irans war strategy which 
is determined by the supreme defense council the radicals growing 
political power could have a significant influence in that regard

a new book by a former reagan aide 
describes the president as highly intelligent with a 
photographic memory but it also characterizes him as a passive 
president who governs like a turkish pasha 
ronald reagan had one distinctive personality trait that 
was highly unusual perhaps unique for someone who rose to the high 
level of managerial responsibility he attained writes martin 
anderson former assistant to the president for policy development 
he made no demands and gave almost no instructions 
andersons book revolution is scheduled to be published 
may 18 some advance copies have been distributed 
the book is generally laudatory of reagans presidency but it 
tends to confirm other books most recently one written by former 
chief of staff donald regan that describe reagan as passive 
essentially he just responded to whatever was brought to his 
attention and said yes or no or ill think about it at times he 
would just change the subject and maybe tell a funny story 
writes anderson now a senior fellow at stanford universitys 
hoover institute 
it was something that all those who had worked closely and 
intimately with ronald reagan knew but we rarely talked about it 
among ourselves and never to outsiders we kept it a secret 
he is highly intelligent with a photographic memory says 
anderson he has a gift for absorbing great amounts of diverse 
information and is capable of combining various parts of that 
information into new coherent packages and then conveying his 
thoughts and ideas clearly and concisely in a way that is 
understandable to almost anyone 
but anderson says reagan made decisions like an ancient king 
or a turkish pasha passively letting his subjects serve him 
rarely did he ask searching questions and demand to know why 
someone had or had not done something 
the president was very dependent on his advisers anderson 
says and the degree to which he trusted and depended on his 
advisers is probably the key to understanding the irancontra 
affair that crippled reagans presidency 
anderson describes nancy reagan as highly intelligent with a 
sixth sense for asking insightful penetrating questions above 
all her judgments on public policy issues political strategy and 
personnel were superb he says 
the book makes no mention of regans account that the first lady 
consulted with an astrologer on her husbands schedule and other 
issues

a member of the jury that convicted a woman in 
the nations first deathbyproducttampering case has admitted 
that she was involved in an earlier product contamination case she 
filed against a cracker company 
juror laurel holliday who had been the lone holdout for 
acquittal until changing her mind on the panels last vote monday 
also told the court that she received an anonymous phone call last 
week telling her that stella nickell failed an fbi polygraph exam 
the information was inadmissible during the trial 
us district judge william dwyer ordered the sevenwoman 
fiveman jury to return to court today for questioning about 
whether they were improperly influenced 
mrs nickell 44 of auburn was convicted of killing her 
husband and a woman with cyanidelaced extrastrength excedrin 
capsules in june 1986 she faces possible life imprisonment at a 
june 17 sentencing 
ms holliday who was retained on the jury with the consent of 
defense lawyer thomas hillier ii said neither the phone call nor 
her previous experience with product contamination influenced her 
decision to vote for conviction she said she was eventually swayed 
by what she called a series of discrepancies in mrs nickells 
testimony 
dwyer and hillier declined comment thursday on the new 
disclosures in the case 
after the verdict when it became known ms holliday had been 
the lone holdout for acquittal hillier raised the issue of 
possible jury tampering and suggested another juror might have 
influenced ms holliday or that she contrived the anonymous 
call to avoid the pressure of being the holdout vote 
ms holliday denied making the call herself and said she doubted 
any other juror would have made it either 
court records show ms holliday settled a lawsuit for 500 
against pepperidge farm inc she had said she bit into a goldfish 
cracker that contained an aspirin substitute ibuprofen 
there were no witnesses and pepperidge farm attorneys questioned 
whether the event ever took place 
ms holliday said she didnt think her lawsuit was important and 
had no bearing on the cyanide case so she didnt reveal it to 
the judge or lawyers involved in picking jurors for the cyanide 
trial 
i thought it didnt apply she said he the judge asked 
about product tampering there was no reason to bring it up 
she said she regarded the cracker incident as a manufacturing 
mishap and said there was no suggestion that it involved product 
tampering 
the episode occurred in july 1986 a month after the two cyanide 
deaths

the nicaraguan rebels chief 
spokesman dismissed reports of a mutiny in the ranks and said the 
leadership was seeking proof of allegations of corruption against 
their top military leader 
bosco matamoros said thursday night that dissidents demanding 
the removal of military commander enrique bermudez are fewer than 
the 726 rebel fighters at a base camp near the nicaraguan border 
he would not give a more specific estimate there have been 
reports 2000 rebels were engaged in a mutiny at the camp in 
yamales a honduran town 20 miles north of the nicaraguan border 
there is not a climate of confrontation there matamoros 
said in an interview they have a legitimate right to differences 
of opinions 
but from that to conclude that the organization is at a 
breaking point would be to ignore the fact that this 
organization has 17000 men 
independent estimates have put rebel strength at half that 
number 
bermudez and two civilian leaders of the contras as the 
ussupported rebels are known met in yamales this week with some 
of the combatants who have accused him of corruption and 
inefficiency 
honduran authorities barred journalists from traveling to the 
camp 
matamoros who said he also visited the camp disputed claims by 
some contra sources that 4000 rebels troops were there 
thats one of the most fantastic things ive heard he said 
contending that 4000 combatants were strung along the entire 
hondurannicaraguan border 
the dissent attracted attention last week when honduras deported 
seven contras field commanders to the united states 
matamoros said the seven had publicly discussed rebel issues a 
sensitive point for honduras which for years has barely 
acknowledged the existence since 1981 of contra base camps on its 
soil 
a dissident field commander who was not deported diogenes 
hernandez membreno fled to yamales 
matamoros said he was briefly detained along the road to the 
camp sunday by some of hernandez membrenos men who he said number 
about 200 
the spokesman said grumblings about bermudez surfaced last month 
and the contras military directors sent a letter april 20 
requesting a meeting to discuss the allegations 
matamoros said that three dissident field commanders including 
hernandez membreno had responded in an april 26 letter but had not 
produced material proof of their accusations that bermudez was 
corrupt and inefficient 
he said the contras 27member council of regional commanders 
would investigate the charges and decide whether disciplinary 
action is warranted bermudez could only be removed by the contras 
civilian leadership 
matamoros dismissed claims bermudez opposes forging a lasting 
peace with nicaraguas leftist sandinista government 
he said bermudez while at yamales on wednesday told the troops 
he fully endorsed the process of negotiations with the 
sandinistas to try to end the 6yearold war 
bermudez 46 was nicaraguas representative to the 
interamerican defense board in washington dc under president 
anastasio somoza the rightist dictator overthrown by the 
sandinistas in 1979 
on march 23 sandinista and contra leaders signed a preliminary 
peace accord a 60day truce took effect april 1 during which the 
two sides were supposed to negotiate conditions for a permanent 
peace that would give the contras a role in the political process 
two rounds of highlevel negotiations in managua since have 
failed to produce substantial progress foremost among issues 
dividing the two sides are how to guarantee security for the 
contras once they move into designated ceasefire zones in 
nicaragua 
the date for the next round of talks has not been set

a pregnant 17yearold senior was crowned 
may day queen of her high school but she and 45 other students 
were suspended from classes today for protesting limits placed on 
her royal duties 
i know there are people out there tonight who feel strongly 
against me being up here and i never thought such a big issue 
would be raised about it annamaria devries said at her 
coronation thursday night 
some people are saying that i have no morals but those people 
dont realize i could have taken an easier way out she added 
the dayton juniorsenior high schools student body elected 
devries queen last month devries who is single and nearly six 
months pregnant says she plans to marry and keep the baby 
there were no protests at the ceremony in the school gymnasium 
in this farming town of 1470 
everything went very well principal tom gallagher said 
she gave a very classy speech 
earlier thursday school officials suspended 45 students who 
protested limits placed on devries reign because of her pregnancy 
the may day queen traditionally visits dayton grade school the 
day after her coronation but after receiving complaints this year 
gallagher canceled the visit 
we got quite a few phone calls from local patrons parents 
ministers whatever just a gamut of different people from the 
community that were upset that the school would allow a pregnant 
young lady to be elected gallagher said 
parents of grade school students were worried that devries 
pregnancy could cause problems by forcing them to answer questions 
from children who see her at the grade schools may day event he 
said 
my stance was does the grade school need to be put in that 
position he said thats their may day their fun day it 
could have put a damper on their celebration 
friends of devries asked the school board monday to overturn 
gallaghers decision but the board unanimously supported the 
principal 
about 75 students from the 330student high school responded 
wednesday with a campus sitin that ended when many of the 
protesters including devries left the campus without permission 
for a march through town gallagher said those students were 
suspended for one day effective today 
devries an honors student who played on the schools softball 
and girls basketball teams said she initially went along with 
gallaghers decision but changed her mind after talking it over 
with friends 
the decision really didnt surprise me i had already heard 
about the complaining she said 
matt yaskovic a senior and organizer of the protest said the 
school was setting a poor example 
they tell us all the time youre adults and have to act like 
one and they get us with all these kiddy rules he said

the us dollar was steady in early european 
trading today with dealers predicting little major movement before 
next tuesdays release of us trade figures for march gold prices 
were fractionally lower 
foreign exchange dealers said the volume of dollar trading was 
very low because many european traders decided to turn thursdays 
ascencion day holiday into a fourday weekend 
traders expect the march trade deficit to range from 125 
billion to 135 billion the us trade gap stood at 138 billion 
in february 
youd need a deficit at least as low as 12 billion to inspire 
any positive move to the dollar said one milan trader 
traders said they didnt attach much importance to todays 
report that japans trade surplus with the united states shrank to 
4125 billion in april from 5129 billion in april 1987 
the us deficit with japan may have improved but it could 
well have worsened with other strong asian economies like taiwan or 
south korea the milan trader said 
in tokyo where the business day ends as europes begins the

federal authorities have charged two transit 
police officers with falsely arresting six men on sexual abuse 
charges in subways in an apparent attempt by the officers to 
improve their arrest records 
officers mary mcdermott 31 and alphonse iannacone 41 were 
charged thursday with five counts of conspiring to violate the 
civil rights of citizens us attorney rudolph w giuliani said 
the cases of seven other transit officers who also had high 
numbers of questionable arrests during the same time period are 
under investigation giuliani said at a news conference 
the two officers charged had arrested six black and hispanic men 
in 1983 and 1984 on charges they lewdly rubbed themselves against 
women in the subway however the victims who were mostly 
white women told the officers they were not aware of the mens 
actions and were not interested in pressing charges 
nevertheless the officers allegedly filed false statements 
indicating the women were victims who could identify the suspects 
and were willing to press charges giuliani said not only were 
the charges not supported but there was a substantial allegation 
they were trumped up 
however william mckechnie president of the transit patrolmens 
benevolent association said he believed that if the officers are 
indicted we are sure that they will be vindicated by a jury of 
their peers 
mcdermott and iannacone who were suspended without pay after 
their arrest face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a 
250000 fine on each of the five counts 
a 1984 transit police department report alleged widespread 
improprieties by mcdermott iannacone and two other transit 
officers 
the report prepared by lt thomas dargan said the managements 
of the transit authority and the transit police shared some of the 
blame because the officers were motivated by a system that gave 
better assignments to those making the most arrests 
i feel sad for the officers dargan said in a telephone 
interview thursday

the only remaining us manufacturer of a 
crucial space shuttle fuel component announced a halt in production 
until it can be shown the factory is safe after explosions leveled 
another plant last week 
kerrmcgee corp made thursdays announcement in the face of 
state pressure 
later in the day the demolished plants operator said a leaking 
natural gas line was responsible for the series of earthquakeforce 
blasts may 4 which killed two people injured 326 and did an 
estimated 73 million in damage 
the report by pacific engineering and production co was 
challenged by southwest gas corp which said the line ruptured 
after the explosions not before 
kerrmcgee said it would suspend production of ammonium 
perchlorate an oxidizer for solid fuel used in the space shuttle 
and military rockets until an independent inspection shows the 
plant is safe 
paul gaines the companys director of governmental relations 
said he hoped production could resume within a few days 
a prolonged shutdown is not helpful to any of us gaines 
said 
he said the company has already contracted with a safety 
consultant to study the plant and the inspection could begin by 
monday gaines said the plant will continue making other chemicals 
gov richard bryan announced the shutdown after company 
officials agreed late thursday morning to the halt bryan said 
legal work was being prepared to force kerrmcgee to suspend 
production before it agreed to the shutdown 
local and state officials had expressed outrage when the plant 
resumed production tuesday of ammonium perchlorate particularly 
since last week plant officials said they would wait until 
authorities determined the cause of the blast before reopening 
kerrmcgee and pacific were the only two plants in the country 
to manufacture ammonium perchlorate and national aeronautics and 
space administration officials have said the explosion could delay 
the space shuttle program 
pacfic engineering chairman fred gibson said thursday that a 
large natural gas line passing through the plant had been leaking 
for at least 30 minutes before the first fire broke out at his 
companys plant 
the massive gas leak is believed to have saturated the earth 
below the paved surfaces of the plant and to have ignited at 
the point of origin as a result of circumstances unrelated to 
plant operations gibson said 
all of the subsequent destructive events were caused by the 
gas leak the gas fire and the gas explosion he said 
southwest gas spokesman dennis hetherington disputed the report 
as far as were concerned our facilities are a victim of the 
explosion and not the cause hetherington said 
fire chief roy parrish said the fire department would withhold 
judgment until it completes its own investigation

scholarly pursuits gave way to a soda 
taste test dismantling a car and other bizarre pursuits as 
california institute of technology underclassmen tried to break 
into seniors cleverly defended rooms 
in an annual ritual known as ditch day on thursday the students 
solved puzzles or met elaborate requirements to gain entry to the 
rooms of seniors who remained on campus at the risk of being tied 
to a tree 
we had a report that a senior came back and was tied to a 
tree said marty obrien 19 of houston who fielded questions 
at ditch day central 
for obscure reasons the challenges left by the seniors are known 
as stacks 
obrien said one stack he came across involved disassembling a 
car and making the pieces fit in four 55gallon drums 
students working on other stacks found they had to climb 
buildings theres been reports of clues being placed on the 
sides of buildings 25 30 feet in the air obrien said 
the sophomore said he worked on a stack created by a senior who 
left a computer terminal outside his door the computer asked 
questions and when given the right answer delivered part of the 
combination to the lock 
the stacks rules required students to don lab coats and nerdy 
safety glasses so we could look as scientific as possible and set 
up a soda taste test on a campus walkway obrien said 
it looks like rc cola slimly over coke and pepsi was way 
down at the end said the chemical engineering major 
obrien and his cohorts eventually got into the room 
i thought we had moments of inspiration which were quite 
helpful he said 
freshman mark dinan 18 of washington dc was part of a crew 
whose stack required them to collect 5 for amnesty international 
water 10 plants around campus erect antironald reagan and 
antigeorge bush signs and write and sing a song to find code 
words spread around the school 
we ran into some trouble one time because somebody stole the 
clue dinan said adding that the puzzle was solved within 4 
hours

prosecutors say theyre ready to press their drug 
case against panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega while a 
federal judge investigates whether the government could drop 
charges against the embattled leader 
chief assistant us attorney richard gregorie the lead 
prosecutor in the case said thursday he strongly opposed any deal 
in the case as part of an effort to persuade noriega to surrender 
his post 
i am against the dismissal and right now i am ready to try 
this case gregorie said 
us attorney leon kellner who met with attorney general edwin 
meese iii in washington agreed 
in a statement released through his office kellner did not 
divulge details of his meeting with meese but said he was ready to 
proceed with the trial 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater acknowledged thursday 
that us officials were engaged in plea bargaining with 
noriega but stopped short of saying that dismissal of the 
indictments was under negotiation 
noriega is charged in a 12count miami indictment with accepting 
46 million in bribes from colombias medellin cartel to protect 
its interests while in tampa he faces three marijuana smuggling 
counts 
us district judge william hoeveler who is handling the case 
questioned whether the government alone can drop the drug 
indictment against noriega 
my understanding and knowledge of the law is that the 
presiding judge is not required to dismiss an indictment on the 
motion of the government hoeveler said however i am having 
the law researched further 
in previous rulings on the case hoeveler has noted the 
government has an obligation to show the indictment was not 
politically motivated 
us attorney robert merkle who brought the tampa indictment 
against noriega refused to comment thursday on reports that he has 
threatened to quit if the charges are dropped 
but noriegas attorneys said the government has little choice 
but to dismiss the indictment because it was politically motivated 
gen noriega believes and always has believed that the 
indictment against him was a political indictment noriega 
attorney neal sonnett said thursday so a dismissal of the 
indictment would have to be a precondition to any discussions

george roses adopted 
18yearold son and the youths natural father were among four 
people charged with murdering the tony awardwinning actor police 
said 
the natural father said rose had sexually abused his son 
domingo antonio ralfe vazquez as well as other youths 
police and doctors also said cocaine was found on the 
68yearold rose and that laboratory tests performed in miami 
showed traces of a cocaine derivative in his body at the time of 
his death 
in a sworn statement police gave reporters on thursday juan 
antonio vazquez padilla the natural father of ralfe vazquez said 
the britishborn performer was held for eight hours on may 4 before 
being clubbed to death 
vazquez said the killers tried to make the death look like the 
result of a singlecar accident on which initial police reports 
blamed it 
a statement read by police spokesman col aquiles cruz gomez at 
a news conference said vazquez ralfe and the youths uncle 
maximo padilla vazquez were arrested a fourth suspect was at 
large 
the statement said the three had confessed to police that they 
planned the crime when they noticed mr george rose felt certain 
amorous weaknesses for another 14year old minor 
the three appeared at the news conference and told reporters 
they took part in the actors death 
what i really wanted was to take revenge on the american rose 
because of his homosexual activities since he was hurting a lot of 
boys in this sector in addition to mine whom he had already 
prostituted since the age of 13 vazquez said in the statement 
however bea garcia a longtime friend and neighbor of rose in 
the north coast town of sosua told the new york times in a 
telephone interview that rose had adopted ralfe in january because 
he wanted an heir but had become disenchanted with the youth 
because he was not attending to a business in which the actor had 
invested 25000 
she added that two weeks before he was killed rose told her he 
wanted to make changes in his will 
vazquez said ralfe padilla and another man he paid 200 agreed 
to take rose to an isolated location and kill him 
on may 4 when rose was driving his car to the city of santiago 
with ralfe the three other men waited by the side of the road near 
sosua and forced the car to stop 
they got in leaving ralfe behind and drove to a nearby farm 
where they held rose for eight hours before killing him it said 
around 8 pm we clubbed him to death beating him on the 
head the statement said 
vazquezs statement said the men took the money from roses 
pockets and divided it but left his documents intact they then 
put roses body in the car and drove to a small ditch where we 
flipped the car over to make it look like a traffic accident 
pathologist sergio sarita told reporters thursday that the car 
was determined to have been traveling under 10 mph when it went 
into the ditch so roses injuries had to have occurred earlier 
he also said tests in miami showed traces of a cocaine 
derivative in roses urine but none in his brain 
police said cocaine was also found in roses wallet 
the actor had owned a beach home outside sosua for the past nine 
years 
ralfe who lived in the house said in a sworn statement 
released by police that he met rose six years ago when he was a 
student and that rose suggested adopting him in 1985 
he said vazquez agreed and the adoption was legal 
ralfe said in the statement that on april 30 he told his father 
rose was returning to the island in a few days and that i felt 
bad because he had shown he felt a certain weakness for a minor 
who lived in our house 
rose who had lived in new york city since 1961 was a versatile 
actor who was as much at home playing shakespeare as he was in a 
comedy or a musical he preferred the stage but also appeared in 
scores of motion pictures and television productions 
a memorial service is planned for may 25 at the shubert theater

two chinese men who threatened to blow up 
a boeing 737 unless it flew from the mainland to taiwan were 
welcomed as refugees today because they risked their lives to 
seek freedom and democracy taiwan said 
china thanked the rival government for returning the chinese 
airliner and its 107 passengers and 11 crew members today nine 
hours after the aircraft was hijacked to a taiwanese military base 
the air pirates meanwhile appeared on taiwan television and 
said they would have killed themselves had their hijacking failed 
chang chingkuo 27 said in an interview on taiwains official 
chinese television service that he and his companion lung 
kueiyun 26 used a toy pistol and a bottle of a phony explosive 
to force the plane to taiwan thursday 
he said he and lung also carried knives 
we would have committed suicide if we failed chang said on 
television we never planned to return to china 
the aircraft was hijacked thursday evening after it left the 
coastal city of xiamen in fujian province for canton the capital 
of neighboring guangdong province 
it landed at an air force base in central taiwan at about 930 
pm less than six hours later the plane was refueled and sent 
back to xiamen with the passengers aboard 
the hijackers remained in taiwan and were granted political 
asylum 
chang was identified as a worker at an arsenal in chinas 
southern yunnan province and lung a steel mill worker in southern 
guizhou province 
a smiling chang displayed a toy pistol and a bottle during the 
televised interview he said he defected because he detested the 
brutality of communism 
government spokesman shaw yuming said at a news conference that 
authorities were investigating the air piracy it was the first 
hijacking of a civilian chinese airplane to taiwan 
the chinese communists and the taiwan nationalists both claim to 
be the legitimate rulers of china and have no direct communications 
links 
the two hijackers are our compatriots shaw said they 
have risked their lives to seek freedom and democracy we must 
respect their wishes and offer them protection their motives were 
simple and noble 
taiwan does not condone nor encourage any hijacking 
behavior shaw said he added we would have been sending them 
to their doom if we turned them back to the communists 
the hijackers didnot appear at the news conference 
in beijing hu yizhou director general of the national airliner 
civil aviation administration of china originally asked taiwan to 
return the hijackers 
after the plane flew back to xiamen however hu thanked the 
civil aeronautics bureau in taiwan for the quick return of the 
airliner and those aboard without mentioning the hijackers 
we are very grateful to you for your help hu was quoted as 
saying by chinas official xinhua news agency 
xiamen in southeastern fujian province is 136 miles across the 
taiwan straits from taiwan 
in 1986 when the pilot of a taiwan airliner operated by china 
airlines diverted his plane to canton mainland officials returned 
the plane and other crew members but did not hand over the 
defecting pilot 
that incident led to the first direct talks between communist 
and nationalist officials last fall the nationalists lifted a ban 
on travel to the mainland

a cabinet minister who said japan was not an 
aggressor in world war ii resigned today an official in his 
governing liberal democratic party said 
seisuke okuno director general of the national land agency 
submitted his resignation to prime minister noboru takeshita said 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity the japan 
broadcast corp also reported okuno resigned 
a remark by okuno three weeks ago that japan was not an 
aggressor in world war ii had drawn condemnation from china south 
korea and north korea 
the veteran politician is widely regarded as the no 3 man in 
government after takeshita and finance minister kiichi miyazawa 
earlier today okuno apologized to japanese officials for the 
furor his comments had caused but continued to stand by them 
i may withdraw my remarks if they disrupt the diet 
parliament but what i said was not wrong he told a group of 
parliamentarians 
to reporters okuno said my comments have incurred criticism 
outside japan and aroused friction in the diet as a result the 
diet and other concerned bodies have suffered 
from the bottom of my heart i am sorry 
the report of his resignation followed press reports that prime 
minister noboru takeshita wanted okuno to step down voluntarily 
kyodo news service said takeshita met with the 75yearold okuno 
today and brought up the option 
it was also a reversal of policy for takeshita who had avoided 
disputing okunos remarks or taking any action against him since 
okuno said april 22 that japan had no aggressive intent in world 
war ii 
okuno had said japan fought to protect itself at a time when 
the white race had turned asia into a colony 
the comment drew condemnation from china south korea and north 
korea and threatened to strain asian relations at a time when 
japans ties with its main ally the united states are marred by 
trade tensions 
opposition leaders today stepped up their calls for okunos 
resignation in meetings with cabinet officials the main opposition 
japan socialist party and the komeito clean government party had 
already decided to submit a noconfidence resolution in parliament 
against okuno if he did not resign a komeito official said 
it was okunos third brush with controversy in his political 
career 
as education minister under then prime minister kakuei tanaka in 
the early 1970s he faced a noconfidence motion after he called 
the japan teachers union a dissident group 
ten years later as premier zenko suzukis justice minister he 
was criticized for advocating revision of japans constitution 
which renounces the use of war 
okunos latest comments came after a visit to yasukuni shrine in 
downtown tokyo where war heroes and class a war criminals are 
enshrined foreign leaders including chinas deng xiaoping 
criticized such official visits

affected than smaller rural institutions in the nations 
midsection

early studies of a highly publicized drug for 
alzheimers disease show some promise but also serious side 
effects in up to 80 percent of patients a researcher says 
nausea vomiting allergic reactions and a worrisome increase in 
liver enzymes have appeared in patients taking the drug said vinod 
kumar of the southern illinois university school of medicine in 
springfield 
no conclusions can be reached yet about the usefulness of 
tetrahydroaminoacridine often called tha he said thursday 
kumar reviewed results of published and unpublished studies from 
canada britain sweden and the united states at the annual meeting 
of the american psychiatric association 
tha generated excitement in 1986 when a study in the new england 
journal of medicine reported dramatic improvement in alzheimer 
symptoms particularly those related to memory deficits 
a nationwide study at 17 institutions began last september but 
it was stopped in october because about 20 percent of patients 
showed the liver abnormalities the trial was restarted earlier 
this year 
alzheimers disease is a progressive irreversible neurological 
disorder affecting an estimated 25 million americans it kills 
more than 100000 people a year 
symptoms include gradual memory loss impaired judgment 
disorientation personality change and loss of language skills 
eventually patients can no longer take care of themselves 
the diseases cause is unknown and it has no cure 
kumar an investigator in the nationwide tha project said early 
results at his institution are promising enough to justify 
continuing the study but they do not prove that the drug is 
effective 
in one of the new studies kumar said canadian researchers 
reported significant improvement among 17 patients who took tha for 
six weeks but 80 percent of the 51 patients who began the study 
suffered side effects and 36 percent of the 17 who completed the 
experiment had the liver problem which indicates cellular 
abnormalities 
a swedish study found significant improvement in five of 10 
patients who took tha for one to two weeks but the side effects 
appeared in seven patients and two showed allergic reactions to 
the drug that kumar said had not been reported before 
three of six patients in a british study showed dramatic 
improvement but also the liver enzyme increase he said 
in contrast to the other studies a 10patient experiment in 
california found no improvement after one week on tha perhaps the 
drug must be taken longer to have an effect kumar said 
three of the california patients had the liver enzyme problem 
no one in any way expects this to be a cure in that it halts 
the progression of alzheimers disease said tha investigator 
maurice dysken of the university of minnesota 
instead the hope is that it will quickly produce an improvement 
in learning and memory he said if the patients abilities then 
deteriorate at the same rate as they would have without the drug 
he will at least be starting from a higher level and so be better 
off at any given point during the decline dysken said 
that would be an advance dysken said in an interview 
if you had a drug that delayed the need for nursing home 
treatment thats not a trivial effect said stephen read an 
alzheimer researcher at the john douglas french center in los 
alamitos calif

i work at a hospital said ms hicks assistant director of 
registration for emergency patients at carrolltons tanner medical 
center i know what serious surgery it is 
crawford long is one of 10 us medical centers selected for 
trials of a gallstone lithotripter that has shown promising results 
in tests in west germany officials said thursday at the news 
conference 
the machine similar to those now commonly used to smash kidney 
stones represents a major step forward in medicine said dr 
harold s ramos medical director at crawford long 
gallstones are small hard masses that can form in the gall 
bladder the lithotripter uses ultrasound to locate the gallstones 
and send shock waves into the gall bladder literally smashing them 
to sandsize fragments which can then be passed into the intestine 
and out of the body 
previously gallstones have been removed only through complex 
surgery which can require a week of hospitalization and six to 
eight weeks of recuperation 
for the first time we will be able to manage gallstones 
effectively without surgery without putting the patient to sleep 
without interruption in their daily lives ramos said 
the 10 medical centers will use a dornier mpl9000 biliary 
lithotripter in investigative trials on some 600 selected patients 
who meet certain criteria 
if approved by the food and drug administration the technique 
could become the method of choice for treatment of gallstones 
which plague as many as 20 million americans each year according 
to dr r carter davis chief of the hospitals gastrointestinal 
diagnostic laboratory 
although patients during the trials will be hospitalized for two 
nights in the near future it will be reduced to an outpatient 
procedure predicted dr william e torres associate professor 
of radiology at emory university and one of the physicians involved 
in the study 
in trials on some 600 german patients about 80 percent have 
been completely free of gallstones or fragments 10 months after 
treatment and only 1015 percent have reported mild minimal 
side effects said dr gustav paumgartner chairman of the 
department of gastroenterology at the university of munich 
in addition to crawford long trials are being conducted at 
cedarssinai medical center in los angeles the university of iowa 
iowa city northwestern university medical center chicago

author shen congwen a vivid portrayer of chinese 
rural life during the chaotic warlord era of the 1920s and 1930s 
died of a sudden heart attack a former student said today he was 
85 
shen died tuesday in beijing where he had lived quietly in 
recent decades researching ancient chinese costumes and folk arts 
said wu ningkun an english professor at the international 
relations institute 
wu said shen had been in poor health for the last five years and 
needed help to walk 
shens novels and short stories describe rural life with an 
ironic eye and sympathy for freespirited minority groups opposed 
to central control his own outspokenness got him into trouble when 
the communists came to power in 1949 
staterun media has not mentioned shens death despite his 
partial rehabilitation in recent years 
shen could describe tersely and without sentiment the casual 
violence of the 20s and 30s as warlords battled each other for 
power after the emperor was overthrown but he also produced lyric 
descriptions of the pastoral life he knew as a child in central 
hunan province 
many of his short works have been translated into english and 
other languages and he is one of the most widely anthologized 
modern writers in englishlanguage collections of chinese 
literature 
shen was born in november or december 1902 into a family of 
career soldiers he was sent to military school at age 13 and 
joined a regiment two years later he left the army after several 
years to work in a tax office and later for a newspaper 
in his early 20s shen went to beijing to study and write soon 
his short stories were appearing in the prestigious short story 
monthly and the literary journal crescent moon which helped 
pioneer the use of colloquial language in literature 
he gained fame in the 1930s with a series of longer works 
including the border town and the long river both about rural life 
in hunan 
he also taught at a various colleges including beijing 
university until 1949 when he was publicly criticized as a 
reactionary shen tried to commit suicide by drinking kerosene and 
slitting his wrists and throat 
even an old literary friend the renowned woman novelist ding 
ling by then a member of the official literary establishment 
criticized shen as having upperclass ambitions ding died in 1986 
in a selfcriticism ordered by the authorities shen wrote that 
his early work had a style but no sense of life most of my 
writing was of no use to the peoples revolution 
after his recovery he was assigned to work as a guide at the 
palace museum in beijing he became an expert on early chinese 
silks and costumes bronze mirrors and other artifacts and began 
researching and writing about these full time giving up fictional 
writing 
like many intellectuals shen was sent to the countryside to 
learn from the peasants during the 196676 cultural revolution but 
escaped serious attack 
in recent years he returned to partial favor his literary 
works have been republished in chinese and in official english 
editions and he was selected to the standing committee of the 
chinese peoples political consultative conference an advisory 
body of intellectuals 
he is survived by his wife zhang zhaohe and two sons funeral 
plans were not immediately announced

the steepest energy price gain in 15 months 
pushed wholesale costs up a moderate 04 percent in april the 
government said today food prices were modestly higher 
if the april increase held for 12 straight months inflation at 
the wholesale level would register an annual increase of 46 
percent more than double the 22 percent 1987 wholesale price rise 
the april increase coming after a 06 percent gain in march 
the sharpest rise in almost a year seems certain to add to 
concerns that inflation is reheating 
in an effort to cool off the economy the federal reserve has 
recently moved to make cash less readily available to the nations 
banking system that credit tightening prompted the nations major 
banks on wednesday to boost their prime lending rate from 85 
percent to 9 percent as concern spread that inflation is now a 
greater threat than recession 
energy prices which had posted sharp declines from september 
through february recorded a 31 percent surge dramatically 
higher even than the 09 percent jump of march 
such prices which labor department analysts said accounted for 
half of the rise in the overall index have not jumped so steeply 
since january 1987 
the energy price surge was widespread with the cost of gasoline 
up 07 percent the price of home heating oil up 52 percent and 
the cost of natural gas up 43 percent 
analysts noting that crude oil prices are on the upswing say 
motorists can expect further rises in gasoline prices the 
wholesale price of gasoline rose 15 percent in march the first 
gain since august 
as for food gains were posted for pork 17 percent chicken 
47 percent vegetables 21 percent and coffee 21 percent 
these rises were offset however by sharp declines in the prices 
of eggs 163 percent fruit 44 percent fish 26 percent and 
beef 01 percent 
overall food prices at wholesale were up 04 percent about 
half of the 07 percent increase of the previous month 
the index of wholesale prices minus food and energy was up a 
tiny 01 percent after a 04 percent increase in march this 
slowdown was likely to be viewed as good news as economists believe 
this calculation is a more accurate reflection of underlying 
inflationary pressures 
part of the reason for the april slowdown in this calculation 
was a 05 percent drop in new car prices a big turnaround from a 
10 percent increase in march 
in releasing its producer price index for goods one step short 
of the retail level the labor department gave these additional 
details on april activity 
capital equipment costs were up a moderate 02 percent half 
the increase of the previous month 
childrens clothing prices gained 06 percent while mens 
clothing costs gained 01 percent the same as the gain recorded 
for womens apparel 
for the first four months of 1988 wholesale prices have risen 
at an annual rate of 29 percent 
the wholesale price index has been showing more restraint than 
the companion consumer price index in part because the consumer 
index charts two areas of considerable recent inflation services 
and imported goods these sectors are not tracked in the wholesale 
price calculation 
the consumer price index rose 44 percent in 1987 and was up 05 
percent in march the cpi figures for april will be released next 
week 
the april increase brought the overall wholesale price index to 
1069 this means that a selection of wholesale goods costing 100 
during a 1982 base period would have cost 10690 last month this 
index itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations as are other 
figures in the report

k mart store officials dont know what 
to make of hundreds of bags of grass fertilizer that were destroyed 
afterhours when rebate coupons and their barcode labels were cut 
off nothing else was taken 
in the past two weeks three area stores have been hit and 658 
bags of fertilizer damaged the palm beach post reported today 
we came in the next morning and we just couldnt believe 
it said vance callahan manager of a hollywood k mart where 150 
rebate coupons were cut out may 1 
the fertilizer was all over the place said david phillips 
manager of a deerfield beach store where the bar codes from 233 
bags were cut out sunday night 
in the latest incident tuesday barcode labels were ripped off 
275 fertilizer bags at a boca raton store 
managers are baffled over why only the barcode labels were 
taken off some bags and only the rebate coupons which can be 
redeemed for 3 or 4 off other bags in order for the rebate to 
be honored the coupon must be accompanied by the barcode label 
and a store receipt callahan said thursday 
theres also another catch there is a limit on the number of 
rebates per household managers said 
who knows phillips said if theyre taking this amount of 
time and organization apparently theyve got something that

a 10yearold boy who was suspended three 
times after shouting biblical epithets at teachers and classmates 
received his fourth suspension today after he stayed outside school 
preaching as his mother watched 
if it pleases the lord im enjoying it said duffey strode 
as an assistant principal tried to get him to come inside id 
rather get gold and silver up in heaven than my education down 
here 
duffey recovering from chicken pox arrived about 730 am on 
his bicycle in a steady rain and was immediately surrounded by some 
two dozen reporters and cameramen wearing a black jacket and 
carrying a zippered case apparently containing a bible he began 
preaching in the parking lot 
thou shall not take the name of the lord thy god in vain he 
shouted thou shalt not commit adultery youre guilty even your 
eyes are filled with adultery men cant keep their eyes off women 
and women cant keep their eyes off men adulterers shall be put to 
death and their blood shall be upon them 
assistant principal shirley ramsey told duffey several times 
that he was supposed to be in the school building before classes 
but the youngster ignored her 
everyone in there can do their hellish things why cant my 
own do theirs asked robin strode duffeys mother after she 
received the boys letter of suspension from eastfield elementary 
school 
mrs strodes other son matthew 5 also has been suspended for 
preaching her daughter pepper 6 also has been suspended because 
she stayed outside with her brothers while they preached matthew 
and peppers suspensions expire may 19 and mrs strode said she 
expected them to be suspended again 
she also said it was her childrens decision to preach 
after the first suspension we asked them to stop preaching 
for a couple of days mrs strode said it just about broke 
their hearts they got real upset 
mrs strode said the letter gave no indication about future 
action to be taken against duffey if he continued his street 
preaching when he returns to school 
mrs ramsey said after handing the boy the letter were 
trying to keep the door open for duffey to return to school 
todays suspension was the latest in a monthlong battle between 
the strode family and school officials 
i see no resolution in sight i just dont see it duffeys 
father david strode said earlier this week its just a bunch 
of people full of the devil there must be a real cesspool of sin 
here 
his son had been suspended once for fighting and twice before 
for remaining outside the school hurling biblical epithets at 
students and teachers 
duffeys letters of suspension havent mentioned his preaching 
principal james gorst wrote a letter to the strodes that said the 
boy had created a loud disruptive noise by screaming at school 
staff members 
but duffeys parents who moved to marion 17 months ago from 
pennsylvania said they are convinced the only problem is duffeys 
preaching 
the strodes call the suspensions an attack on their 
constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of 
religion and say they plan to take the county school system to 
court 
nobody nowadays wants to stand up for jesus christ mrs 
strode said i just dont understand it 
federal appeals court judge sam ervin iii told school officials 
thursday that if they take reasonable action in such cases they 
are protected under the law 
constitutional rights of students are not automatically 
coextensive with adults in a general setting ervin said 
school officials and duffeys parents agree that his street 
preaching intensified after a march 18 scuffle with three other 
boys at school 
gorst decided to paddle all four boys but when it was duffeys 
turn he bolted from the school and ran home mrs ramsey said 
his flight earned him his first suspension 
when he returned he began his preaching first directing his 
warnings of hellfire and damnation at other students 
later he hurled them at teachers as they arrived for work each 
morning calling them fornicators whoremongers adulterers and 
queers

federal scientists are abandoning efforts to 
develop a completely artificial human heart after spending more 
than a quarterbillion dollars because every use of such devices 
has resulted in the eventual death of the patient 
from now on government research support will concentrate 
instead on developing a smaller pump that can assist rather than 
replace a failing heart 
there are still a lot of problems that cannot soon be solved 
with a total heart replacement device dr claude lenfant director 
of the national heart lung and blood institute said thursday 
every attempt at total heart replacement has resulted in a 
patient dying of either infection or stroke caused by blood clots 
that develop within the mechanical heart said lenfant 
those issues have not been resolved he said in an interview 
the national institutes of health have given a total of 27 
million in research grants on the totalheart replacement this 
year but lenfant said that will be the last since 1964 the 
agency has spent 23931 million on various elements of artificial 
heart development technology 
now lenfant said the agency will support only four grants for 
the development of a selfcontained longterm single 
ventricular device this would be inserted into the left 
ventricle of the heart the chamber that endures most of the work 
stress in the fourchambered human heart 
we believe there can be an extremely reliable single ventricle 
system developed for clinical application said lenfant 
the single ventricle device already has been used in more than 
170 cases as a bridge to transplant but it has not been 
implanted for longterm use he said 
john w wood jr president of thermedics inc of woburn mass 
said his company now has such a longterm device being tested in 
experiments with animals 
he said the device which is an electrically driven 
diaphragmlike pump called the heartmate is inserted into the left 
ventricle of the heart and powered by a battery 
powering the heart device has been solved with an electrical 
conduction system 
the heartmate is equipped with an electrical coil wood said a 
similar coil is placed on the outside of the body and electricity 
is conducted through the skin to recharge the battery in this way 
the patient will have no wires or tubes leading to the artificial 
pump lowering the risk of infection 
wood said the device has been tested successfully on calves and 
an application is pending for clinical trials 
a second assist device designed to be used only temporarily is 
now on the market this device is inserted to assist the heart only 
until the heart has recovered from trauma or until a donor heart 
can be found 
lenfant said the total artificial heart replacement has been 
attempted five times worldwide but none was considered successful 
the jarvik7 artificial heart was the most widely used in the 
united states barney clark received the first artificial heart on 
dec 2 1982 his university of utah surgeon was dr william 
devries clark died in march 1983 
william schroeder who received his artificial heart at the 
humanaaudubon hospital in louisville ky where devries practiced 
later lived longest with the jarvik device almost two years 
in a statement released by the humanaaudubon hospital devries 
said he regretted the nih decision and said this decision will 
delay the eventual clincial reality of the total artificial heart 
devries said the nih decision will not affect his research 
because it is privately financed he predicted that because of such 
government decisions more and more advanced medical research will 
have to be funded by the private sector 
lenfant said the jarvik device was successful mechanically but 
the interface with the body was never successful 
he said tubes leading to the outside may have contributed to the 
infections that killed some of the patients and the pump itself led 
to blood clots that cause strokes 
at the university of utah which had received one of the nih 
artificial heart research grants dr donald olsen told the atlanta 
constitution that cancellation of the research contracts is a 
tremendous setback for scientific advancement in the field 
four companies however will receive grants for continued study 
of the heart assist device said lenfant in addition to thermedics 
of boston they are abiomed of danvers mass nimbus inc of 
sacramento calif and novacor of oakland calif 
figures on the heart assist device research grants were not 
immediately available from nih but wood said his company was 
receiving a fouryear grant of 64 million for testing and 12 
million for development of subassemblies that would be made 
available to the other companies

a metal processing plant where a fire killed 
one worker and injured nine others had been cited for previous fire 
safety problems according to city fire records 
the explosion in a metal dust collector at mineral met inc on 
the citys east side thursday spewed flaming metal chips throughout 
an industrial plant sparking a fire that took three hours to bring 
under control two of those injured remained in critical condition 
today 
fire inspectors reports indicate the company has been cited for 
poor fire prevention including the accumulation of highly 
flammable dust and poor dust control 
the records also show fires in 1984 and 1986 were attributed to 
careless smoking in dusty conditions and a 1976 fire was started 
by machinery sparks 
however plant manager keith edwards told radio station weream 
today in recent years i think weve cooperated very well with 
the fire prevention department and even a couple of them had 
commented that they thought we had been doing a good job in recent 
years 
twentynine employees were inside the plant when the fire 
erupted 
the dust collector blew up and spread these flaming metal 
chips and debris all over and started the fire said fire chief 
james mcnamee the workers were in the grinding room where this 
dust is generated 
the most explosive powdered metals including aluminum and 
manganese were stored away from the fire behind four fire doors 
the city ordered installed in 1986 
firefighters found the dead workers body inside the plant after 
the blaze was brought under control about noon lonall drake 32 
of cleveland a temporary worker at the plant was killed in the 
explosion a coroners spokesman said 
businesses near the plant on the citys east side were 
evacuated while firefighters worked to keep the blaze from 
spreading to a the warehouse containing the powdered metals 
cleveland metropolitan general hospital spokeswoman terri manns 
said two men were in critical condition with burns over 30 to 37 
percent of their bodies four others remained in fair or good 
condition at the hospital she said 
one person was transferred to an erie pa with a foot injury 
and three others were treated and released at other hospitals

police snipers killed five sikh militants 
in the golden temple complex today and one sikh militant was 
killed trying to escape a police cordon around the holy shrine 
police said 
today was the fifth day of a siege of the temple where a band 
of militants was holed up about 100 sikh militants remain in the 
temple complex which is surrounded by about 2500 policemen and 
paramilitary troops 
punjab state police chief kps gill said the militants and the 
security forces exchanged fire after sunrise for much of the day 
during the afternoon police sharpshooters positioned in nearby 
buildings killed five militants gill said 
the other militant was killed earlier in the day when a 
halfdozen men tried to shoot their way through the security 
forces cordon he said 
the government launched its siege monday after sikh militants in 
the temple complex opened fire on security forces and injured five 
officers no food or other supplies have been allowed into the 
temple since then 
the killings brought the death toll at the complex to at least 
27 since monday at least five of those killed were civilians 
caught in the crossfire 
because any attempt to storm the shrine would almost certainly 
spark violent reprisals by sikhs outraged at the desecration of 
their holiest shrine the siege appears aimed at forcing the 
militants into submission or at least containing them the temple 
complex is the foremost stronghold of armed sikhs who want to 
establish a separate sikh nation in punjab state 
the army stormed the complex in june 1984 to oust extremists 
and about 1200 people were killed in retaliation prime minister 
indira gandhi was assassinated by two of her sikh bodyguards 
on thursday police lifted the curfew in the old walled city 
except for the immediate vicinity of the shrine people began 
returning to the streets today 
gill told a news conference six sikh militants firing ak47 
rifles attempted to storm out of the golden temple complex shortly 
after midnight 
security forces whose weapons apparently were equipped with 
nightvision scopes returned fire and killed one of the sikhs two 
escaped into the city and three retreated into the temple complex 
gill said he said that one of the escapees was believed injured 
gill said two paramilitary soldiers with the central reserve 
police force were injured in the shootout 
at daybreak the bodies of more five men were seen inside the 
complex gill said they apparently died during overnight exchanges 
with security forces 
gill said security forces control all the dominant features 
around the temple 
sikhs whose religion was founded about 500 years ago as an 
alternative to islam and hinduism claim they are discriminated 
against by indias majority hindus sikhs make up less than 2 
percent of indias 800 million people but are a majority in this 
northern state 
the extremists have been waging a guerrilla campaign since 1982 
for more political autonomy or an independent homeland in punjab 
at least 955 deaths in punjab state have been blamed on the 
extremists so far this year most of the victims have been hindus 
or moderate sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign 
the golden temple stands toward the western end of the complex 
at the center of a large pool the middle section contains a dining 
hall and a large meeting hall while office buildings are to the 
east

two hours or less 
darryl seigel 38 is facing maximum fines totaling 6000 for 
taking a few puffs on a cigarette he admits he smoked while in the 
planes lavatory thursday 
seigel claims he did not purposely break the law but lit up 
absentmindedly when he was in the plane lavatory it was a 
honest mistake he said 
seigel was detained by reno cannon international airport 
security for two hours thursday at the request of the usair flight 
crew said airport spokesman rich peacock 
he is accused of smoking on a flight where it is banned smoking 
in the lavatory and tampering with the lavatory smoke detector the 
federal aviation administration could fine him 2000 for each 
alleged violation peacock said 
about 20 minutes into the plane ride a flight attendant spotted 
smoke after seigel left the lavoratory asked him if he knew about 
the federal law against smoking on certain flights then informed 
him he would be arrested when they landed according to peacock 
the flight attendant had explained the new law to passengers 
before the plane took off he added 
the federal smoking ban on short flights went into effect april 
23 
ronald steele operations inspector for the federal flight 
standards district office in reno said he believes seigel is the 
first person to be charged with violating that law

the number of aids cases jumped at least 72 
percent worldwide with the epidemic concentrated in the americas 
and spread in three distinct geographic patterns the world health 
organization reports 
in a report published thursday by the us centers for disease 
control who says 34913 cases of aids had been reported for 1987 
as of march 21 
the report noted that although 1987 reporting was not then 
complete the figure already represented a 72 percent increase over 
1986 
by comparison the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome increased 92 percent from 1985 to 1986 and 110 percent 
from 1984 to 1985 
including cases reported since march 21 the global total of 
aids cases has reached 91905 in the seven years since the disease 
was detected who said today 
the report came on the eve of a meeting here on how to stop aids 
from spreading among us schoolage youth more than 100 educators 
from across the country were expected to attend the threeday 
conference which begins tonight and is cosponsored by the cdc and 
the national education association 
who has reported aids cases in 139 countries since 1981 
thirtysix other countries have told the genevabased organization 
that they have had no cases 
the real number is thought to be much higher because reporting 
has only just begun in some places such as some african countries 
who said aids reporting indicates three broad yet distinct 
geographic patterns of transmission 
regions containing industrialized countries with large numbers 
of aids cases such as north america western europe australia 
new zealand and parts of latin america 
in these areas most cases have occurred among homosexual or 
bisexual men and among abusers of injectible drugs male patients 
outnumber females as much as 15 to 1 heterosexual transmission 
accounts for a small albeit growing number of cases 
areas of central eastern and southern africa and some 
caribbean countries in these areas most cases have occurred among 
heterosexuals affecting as many women as men in some urban areas 
researchers estimate up to 25 percent of the sexually active 
population is infected with the virus that causes aids 
areas of eastern europe the middle east asia and most of the 
pacific here the aids virus was apparently not introduced until 
the early to middle 1980s and only small numbers of cases have 
been reported generally cases here have occurred among people who 
have traveled to aidsendemic areas or had sexual contact with 
people from such areas according to who 
the cdc report analyzed 84256 aids cases reported to who 
through march 21 the latest data available at the time the report 
was prepared 
in the americas 42 countries have reported 61602 cases or 73 
percent of the worlds aids cases the united states accounted for 
54233 of those with 2325 in brazil and 1517 in canada as of 
this week however the united states has reported 7363 more cases 
to the cdc 
eight other countries in the americas have reported more than 
100 aids cases haiti mexico the dominican republic trinidad and 
tobago the bahamas colombia argentina and venezuela 
africa has reported 10973 cases second to the americas 
uganda tanzania congo kenya burundi rwanda malawi and zambia 
have each reported more than 500 aids cases more than 70 percent 
of africas aids cases were reported last year fortytwo african 
countries or territories have reported aids 
in europe 27 countries or territories have reported 10616 aids 
cases with the largest numbers in france with 3073 west 
germany 1669 italy 1411 and the united kingdom 1227 the 
lowest rates have come from eastern european countries 
oceania has reported 834 aids cases including 758 in australia 
while asia has reported only 231 cases 
while asia including the populous countries of china and the 
soviet union have reported only a small number of cases who 
director general halfdan mahler said last year that some asian 
nations were most vulnerable to an aids epidemic because of weak 
healthcare systems 
the soviet union and china however both have very great 
social structure and social control as well as health programs 
that could help prevent the spread of aids mahler said 
but even there they are very very concerned now to build up 
very rapidly a kind of surveillance structure to deal with aids 
he said

the senate was trying to agree today on a plan 
for navy ships and air force planes to become more involved in the 
war on drugs but the pentagon was resisting the proposals 
the key dispute involves whether to give the navy authority to 
arrest suspected drug traffickers caught outside the threemile 
limit recognized by the united states say senators involved in the 
effort 
this issue of arrest powers is a very tricky and involved 
legal issue said sen ted stevens ralaska the military is 
very worried about the implications of this and just how it would 
work but well be able to work something out no question 
the public wants this done said stevens i get a lot of 
people saying to me that we ought to get the military involved in 
this that the military has the power to do something about this 
the pentagon isnt too happy about this stevens said but 
theyre going to have to get involved its a war out there and 
its time for them to join the war 
the antidrug plan was the major unresolved issue as the senate 
worked toward completion of a pentagon budget bill for the fiscal 
year beginning oct 1 
the house version of the pentagon bill approved by that chamber 
wednesday ordered president reagan to have the military 
substantially halt the flow of illegal drugs across us 
borders 
neither of the two main senate plans goes that far but whatever 
passes the senate eventually will have to be reconciled with the 
house measure during a conference committee 
one senate proposal backed chiefly by sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the armed services committee would have the military 
provide logistical help and intelligence chiefly from air force 
radar planes to civilian law enforcement agencies 
the other authored by sens pete wilson rcalif and alfonse 
damato rny goes beyond the nunn plan by also giving the 
military the authority to arrest suspected drug traffickers on the 
high seas 
defense secretary frank c carlucci spent several hours thursday 
afternoon at the capitol discussing the various plans carlucci 
said earlier this week that he didnt feel the pentagon should be 
involved in law enforcement work 
damato asked about the reaction of pentagon officials to his 
plan said theyre not happy theyre not doing cartwheels 
but wilson said the military is going to have to do more they 
may not be happy but theyll do what they can 
sen bob graham dfla agreed local law enforcement is 
being overwhelmed by a flood of drugs we need to stop it beyond 
the borders once it gets into the united states it is 
immeasurably more difficult to control 
the military is now barred from enforcing civilian laws by the 
posse comitatus act an 1878 law enacted to halt the practice of 
having the army enforce laws in the postcivil war southern states 
that law was amended in 1981 to permit the military to provide 
some aid and us military surveillance information is now passed 
along to some civilian agencies in addition coast guard officials 
now travel aboard navy ships patrolling the caribbean sea 
at the pentagon on thursday chief spokesman dan howard said the 
military could slow but not halt drug trafficking 
we have ample military resources to be able to stop every 
aircraft at our border but in fact thats a much more complex 
problem than i think most people realize he said 
nunn agreed he noted that for example pentagon aerial 
surveillance is chiefly aimed at relatively highflying soviet jets 
and bombers rather than the small lowflying planes used for drug 
trafficking 
the bill authorizes overall military spending in the next fiscal 
year of 2995 billion that is the same amount in the house 
measure 
in working on the bill thursday the senate 
killed 8213 the latest attempt to have the chamber express a 
formal opinion on reagans persian gulf policy the plan by sen 
brock adams dwash would have asked for a detailed plan from 
reagan about his policy in the region and would have given 
congress 15 days after that to vote on the policy 
killed 5739 a proposal to halt most us underground nuclear 
testing the house approved an underground test ban meaning the 
issue will have to be resolved by a conference committee 
aboveground atomic tests have been outlawed since 1963 
restored on a 6432 decision a buy america provision 
requiring the pentagon to purchase usmade products including 
anthracite coal the pentagon says it already has a fouryear 
supply of the coal and doesnt need any more the buy america 
plan had been stripped out of the bill by the armed services 
committee 
rejected 6037 an amendment banning any us combat troops in 
leftistruled nicaragua or its neighbor usbacked honduras the 
troop ban was approved last week by the house an indication that 
lawmakers distrust reagans repeated assurances that he has no 
intention of using us combat troops against nicaragua 
killed 6136 a proposal to cut spending for the railroad 
version of the mx nuclear missile from 700 million to 200 and use 
the extra 500 million to buy more nonnuclear weapons the house 
proposes to spend only 100 million for the rail version of the mx

lawmakers agreed today that japan will pay the 
benefits of japanese employees of the us military 
the parliaments house of councilors approved the measure which 
was a revision of an agreement with the united states in which 
japan agreed to pay half the costs 
during a visit to washington in january prime minister noboru 
takeshita pledged to increase japans contribution to the cost of 
maintaining american forces here 
the governing liberal democratic party and the democratic 
socialist party the thirdlargest opposition party backed the 
agreement said sadanori yajima a house official it was opposed 
by the socialist and communist parties and the no 2 opposition 
komeito 
under the revision japan will shoulder up to 100 percent of the 
costs of eight types of benefits and allowances of the 
approximately 21000 japanese now employed at us military bases 
yajima said 
the benefits include retirement pay housing transportation and 
cost of living allowances 
the workers basic salary is paid by the united states 
government 
in the earlier fiveyear agreement which went into effect last 
june japan agreed to pay 50 percent of those costs amounting to 
an estimated 167 million in fiscal 1988 according to yajima 
the revision will boost japans share to 100 percent by 1991 it 
was prompted by calls from the united states for japan to increase 
its share of the costs in light of the appreciating value of the 
yen 
the measure was approved by the cabinet and earlier passed the 
lower house of representatives

gov mario cuomo today vetoed legislation 
that would have restored the death penalty in new york it was 
cuomos sixth veto of the bill and the 12th consecutive year it 
has been blocked by the states chief executive 
it was not immediately known if the state legislature would 
attempt to garner the twothirds vote needed to override cuomos 
veto but assemblyman vincent graber the death penaltys chief 
advocate in that chamber said last week that he didnt have enough 
votes to override 
cuomo said once again that he would urge the legislature to pass 
his alternative proposal to give life without parole to the states 
most violent criminals 
my opposition to granting to the state the power to execute 
this ultimate and violent act of retribution is wellknown cuomo 
said if there is a serious interest in enhancing the sanctions 
for the most serious crimes there should be no reason to postpone 
enactment of a life without parole statute 
restoration of the death penalty was vetoed six consecutive 
years from 197782 by cuomos predecessor fellow democrat gov 
hugh carey and has been vetoed every year since then by cuomo 
the last criminal to die in new yorks electric chair was eddie 
lee mays in 1963 federal and state court rulings have since 
rendered capital punishment statutes sill on the books in new york 
to be unenforceable 
death penalty advocates hoped that outrage over three police 
officer shootings in new york city so far this year would change 
the minds of some legislators opposed to capital punishment those 
deaths include the executionstyle slaying of new york city rookie 
officer edward byrne who was killed while guarding a witness in a 
drug case 
an override in the 150member democraticcontrolled assembly 
would need 100 votes but the vote on the bill in that house last 
week fell eight votes short of that total 
the republicancontrolled senate passed the bill 3817 in 
february but sponsor sen dale volker said he could generate the 
three additional votes needed in the 61member house 
the legislation would have allowed the death penalty in cases 
where an onduty police officer or prison guard was murdered when 
the murder was committed to prevent a person from testifying at a 
criminal proceeding in murderforhire cases or when the defendant 
committed murder along with another violent felony such as 
kidnapping rape or robbery

us officials said today they are monitoring 
a nuclearpowered soviet satellite that the tass news agency says 
will fall to earth this august or september 
maj alex mondragon a spokesman for the us space ccommand in 
colorado springs colo said that the satellite kosmos 1900 has 
been in a steadily decaying orbit for the last month if nothing is 
done to correct its orbit it will decay and reenter earth 
atmosphere 
the official soviet tass news agency reported this morning that 
kosmos 1900 has a nuclear power plant aboard and would fall to 
earth in august or september but that the radioactive material 
aboard would not present a danger 
neither tass nor the us spokesman described the mission of 
kosmos 1900 but it is believed to be one of two rorsat satellites 
the soviets have in orbit to monitor the movement of american 
warships rorsat is an american designation which stands for radar 
ocean reconnaissance satellite 
the tass announcement made available by the agencys office in 
washington said that the artificial earth satellite kosmos 1900 
with a nuclear power plant aboard was launched dec 12 1987 
according to competent soviet oranizations radio contact with 
the satellite was lost in april 1988 the satellite is continuing 
in its oriented flight and the main service systems are 
functioning according to the program 
the satellite will fly in orbit until augustseptember 1988 
after which it will cease to exist the satellite kosmos 1900 has 
systems insuring radiation safety on completion of the flight 
tass said 
the tass announcement came as a top soviet space official roald 
sagdeyev and private american scientists urged a ban on nuclear 
reactors in earth orbit a measure designed to block the reagan 
administrations star wars program such a ban also would end 
rorsat 
sagdeyev director of the soviet space research institute told 
a news conference that he had been in the united states for several 
weeks and had no fresh information on kosmos 1900 
the main target of the proposed ban on orbiting reactors 
sagdeyev and the americans said is the us sp100 program a 
pilot for the orbiting nuclear reactors that many scientists 
believe would be needed to power the exotic weapons envisioned in 
president reagans plans for a spacebased missile defense 
the proposed ban would not apply to nuclear reactors aboard 
missions in deep space such as a manned mission to mars sagdeyev 
said 
but an agreement to ban nuclear reactors from orbit would be a 
major barrier to any future arms race in space since nuclear 
reactors are compact sources of large quantities of power necessary 
for many military purposes said a joint statement signed by 
sagdeyev and frank von hippel of the federation of american 
scientists 
sagdeyev an adviser to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has 
been at the forefront of soviet efforts to block the strategic 
defense initiative as star wars is formally known 
some administration officials also have credited sagdeyev and 
yevgeny velikhov vice president of the soviet academy of 
scientists with bringing to gorbachevs attention many us 
scientific papers arguing that star wars may be an impossible 
dream that perception is thought to have led gorbachev to soften 
his antisdi rhetoric at the washington summit last december 
two previous rorsats have fallen to earth detailed in a 
background paper by steven aftergood a member of the american 
group calling for the ban aftergood is executive director of the 
committee to bridge the gap a los angeles organization opposed to 
star wars 
in january 1978 kosmos 954 a rorsat powered by 110 pounds of 
uranium reentered the atmosphere and spread radioactive debris 
across western canada 
the soviets redesigned the reactors aboard rorsat so they would 
eject their fuel rods as the satellites reentered the atmosphere 
theoretically burning up the radioactive waste according to 
william e burrows in his book deep black about spy 
satellites 
one of the newly designed rorsats dropped from orbit on jan 25 
1985 and the reactor is believed to have splashed into the indian 
ocean 
sagdeyev and von hippel said the radioactive material aboard 
kosmos 1900 was expected to vaporize on reentry and not fall to 
earth 
currently the soviets have two rorsats in orbit kosmos 1824 
launched last june 18 and kosmos 1900 launched last dec 12 
according to nicholas johnson author of the annual soviet year 
in space 1987 
while it is not clear how the soviets would replace the rorsat 
program if they observed a ban on orbiting nuclear reactors 
johnson believes that they are experimenting with a new type of 
ocean surveillance satellite kosmos 1818 which behaves 
differently than previous soviet military satellites 
the power supply and the mission of kosmos1818 type satellites 
have not been disclosed although johnson hypothesizes that they 
may be designed to monitor the movement of us warships in the far 
north and may be related to the capability disclosed by gorbachev 
last december to detect nucleartipped missiles aboard submarines

the prosecutor in the 
cocainesmuggling case of carlos lehder rivas today urged jurors 
who have heard seven months of testimony to convict the colombian 
of everything or nothing 
in fact he is guilty of all the counts in the indictment you 
either convict him of everything in this case or convict him of 
nothing in this case us attorney robert merkle said in his 
final arguments 
the panel which is being sequestered then received 
instructions from us district judge howell w melton and began 
deliberations 
the jury must determine whether lehder was responsible for 
smuggling tons of cocaine into this country from his native 
colombia or whether he was victimized by a group of deceitful 
american smugglers as the defense contends 
lehder 38 and codefendant jack carlton reed 57 are charged 
with conspiring to smuggle 33 tons of cocaine via lehders private 
bahamian island normans cay from 1978 to 1980 
in arguments thursday merkle charged that lehder wore masks 
that have been stripped away by the evidence 
merkle claimed that arguments by defense attorney edward r 
shohat were an attempt to plant a seed of doubt in your mind that 
is not there 
the prosecutor challenged the defenses contention that lehder 
was victimized by convicted drug smuggler ed ward and members of a 
us smuggling organization ward was just another pilot 
merkle said 
he reserved his harshest comments for lehder who has been 
depicted by more than 100 government witnesses as a flamboyant 
womanizing neonazi 
this guy has a screw loose ladies and gentlemen merkle 
said he wasnt playing with a full deck 
in a surprise move last week defense lawyers announced they 
would call no witnesses shohat concluded his arguments thursday by 
telling jurors to do what you feel is right 
the jury must not condemn lehder based on the prosecutions 
attacks on his character said shohat but stick to the specific 
charges in the indictment 
the issue is not whether mr lehder was good or bad the issue 
in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment said shohat 
he ridiculed the government for trying to make it appear that 
lehder who has been identified as a key figure in colombias 
violent medellin cartel was responsible for this countrys drug 
problem 
if that is true you could lock up the doors to this 
courthouse and tear down all the just say no signs shohat 
said referring to the national antidrug campaign 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise he was arrested near the colombian 
city of medellin in february 1987 after a shootout and was 
immediately flown to florida for trial

hours after the superpowers resolved 
anticheating issues blocking senate debate on ratifying a nuclear 
missileban treaty another hitch emerged us officials said 
today 
the new dispute kept american and soviet negotiators up through 
the night before it was settled shortly after dawn 
the disagreement was over the size of canisters that could leave 
a soviet missile assembly plant without being subject to us 
inspection 
they are hard bargainers secretary of state george p 
shultz told a news conference at nato headquarters they keep 
trying us on for size 
he did not accuse the soviets of bad faith but said the united 
states would remain on guard as the treaty to scrap 
intermediaterange missiles is implemented 
in geneva on thursday shultz wound up negotiations with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a schevardnadze and declared we feel 
all of the issues have been dealt with satisfactorily 
but a few hours later the soviets teleeftist government reached a 
truce 
agreement that allows for such aid to the rebels 
but no deliveries have been made inside nicaragua because of a 
variety of obstacles including the inability of the two sides to 
settle on a mutally acceptable delivery agent 
the secretary general of the organization of american states 
joao baena soares has criticized both deliveries of food to contra 
camps in honduras and the cashforfood plan 
baena soares a member of a verification commission assigned to 
ensure compliance with the contrasandinista agreement has said 
that neither plan falls within the limits of what the two sides 
have approved 
but an administration official said earlier this week that the 
other member of the commission nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo has raised no objections to the cashforfood plan 
the administration has accused the sandinista government of 
using delaying tactics during negotiations in a bid to starve the 
contras into submission 
but nicaraguan vice president sergio ramirez said thursday his 
government is willing to allow immediate delivery of humanitarian 
supplies to rebels in nicaragua he denied that the government is 
trying to starve the contras 
we are in full disposition to accept that the contra forces 
could receive humanitarian aid inside nicaragua tomorrow if 
possible ramirez told reporters after a 1hour meeting with 
house speaker jim wright dtexas and other democratic 
congressional leaders 
ramirez did not discuss his views on the cashforfood plan 
wright has described the plan as a last resort because there 
are no guarantees the money wont be used to buy weapons 
aids position is that the amounts of money involved are too 
small to buy many weapons and in any case the contras highest 
priority for the time being is eating

the state health department has closed 
all but two units of a private innercity philadelphia hospital 
where officials say inadequate care might have caused 12 deaths in 
the past year 
the action thursday followed a threemonth investigation at the 
james g giuffre medical center that focused on 66 cases since may 
1987 it found 124 deficiencies including 29 instances of 
unnecessary surgery and 55 cases of postoperative complications 
according to department spokesman gary froseth included in the 
allegations was a report that a doctors unlicensed son had 
assisted in surgery the hospitals namesake and chief executive 
officer and his daughter both licensed physicians must refrain 
from patient care until further investigation by the state 
the hospital will remain closed until they submit a plan of 
corrections and we determine those areas cited as deficient have 
been corrected froseth said thursday when we have done that 
those areas can be reopened 
he said no deadline for the plan was set 
in a statement hospital officials said many problems already 
have been addressed and the officials hope to receive permission to 
reopen all units soon 
we are pleased that giuffre officials have agreed to this 
plan health secretary n mark richards said we believe a 
change in the giuffre board is the first step in implementing other 
changes which will allow the facility to eventually operate in 
accordance with departmnent regulations 
richards said the department is willing to work with giuffre to 
ensure that the facility meets proper healthcare standards 
investigators were to return to the hospital today to check reports 
that some deficiencies already have been corrected he said 
while scrutiny in many patient cases fell on giuffre many of 
the other problems involved the board of directors according to 
froseth 
under an agreement giuffre and state officials signed thursday 
froseth said health department officials expect giuffres entire 
board of directors to leave immediately the 15member board will 
be replaced by may 25 froseth said 
but peter d carlino the boards chairman told the philadelphia 
inquirer thursday night that the board had agreed only to 
reorganize and that some members could remain he said no 
decision had been made yet on whether giuffre would remain 
froseth said the order bans giuffre and the two other doctors 
comprising allied surgical associates his daughter dr adrienne 
giuffre and dr lee weissman from participation or involvement 
in administration patient care consultation or other services 
until the state has determined that all questions regarding the 
groups activities and conduct have been resolved 
the order allows the hospitals clinic and the drug and alcohol 
inpatient services to continue operating it closes all inpatient 
acute care including surgical services the emergency room and the 
podiatric clinic patients already at the hospital which treats 
some of the citys poorest residents will continue receiving 
treatment froseth said 
the hospitals status as a medicare treatment center also has 
been jeopardized the state said

for every superstitious gambler who 
plans to avoid casinos on friday the 13th it seems just as many 
believe theyll hit the jackpot today 
on friday the 13th we expect weird players they get more 
excitable said casino pit boss margaret miller who supervises 
gambling tables we just hope its not a full moon on top of 
that 
but if the portents are unclear for casino gamblers stock 
market players might want to note a university of miami study that 
says the illstarred day often does bring them bad luck 
the study released thursday by professors robert kolb and 
ricardo rodriguez showed that stocks over a 23year period dropped 
on fridays the 13th at an average annualized rate of 245 percent 
that the professors said is how much the market would drop in a 
year if it dropped as much every day as it did on the unlucky 
fridays 
the study also showed that on all other fridays stocks rose at 
an annualized average rate of 279 percent 
the study examined all trading days from 19621985 the school 
said 
most casino employees say friday will be like any other day 
because gamblers routinely do quirky things in pursuit of the big 
win 
take for instance asian players who ask dealers to remove jade 
jewelry 
they believe it brings good luck to those who wear it said 
floor person bill jarrett who oversees dealers monitors betting 
and caters to gamblers who bet large sums of money 
italian gamblers often sprinkle salt on the tables green felt 
supposedly to ward off evil spirits said floor person guy brady 
you dont say anything and just clean it up later brady 
said 
one dealer recalled a man who wouldnt settle for just a 
rabbits foot and hid a live rabbit in a paper bag 
sometimes people rub your hand or touch your arm for good 
luck said dealer jeanne vercio other players she said put a 
variety of lucky charms on tables including small plastic 
leprechauns coins and shamrocks 
some players place a rosary or place voodoo dolls on their 
cards dealers say 
floor person loretta sutton said some gamblers get upset if a 
dealer changes the colors of their chips to advance them to a 
higher denomination 
and a lot of players also dont like pregnant dealers she 
said they think the house will win all the time because a 
pregnant woman is lucky

the federal flood insurance program has been 
expanded but coastal residents who want full protection may need 
to act before june 1 
under the new regulations insurance coverage will be extended 
to coastal buildings subject to imminent collapse or subsidence 
as a result of erosion 
coverage would provide funds to either relocate or demolish the 
structure in imminent danger previously insurance coverage 
extended only after damage had occurred

place by june 1 according to the federal emergency management 
agency which oversees the flood insurance programs 
after that date protection for imminent collapse will be 
available only after insurance has been in place for two years or 
for the full time of ownership if that is less than two years fema 
said 
while fema supervises the program the actual insurance policies 
are sold through private local insurance brokers

the head of czechoslovakias roman 
catholic church has written an unusually tough letter to the 
communist premier saying churchstate relations are at the crisis 
point and that government policy must be changed 
in the letter dated april 23 and made available this week to 
emigres in vienna cardinal frantisek tomasek told premier lubomir 
strougal that police force used to break up a peaceful 
demonstration in bratislava in march showed a new policy of 
dialogue is needed 
it has become clear that the contacts between the state and 
the church have reached a crisis the letter said a copy was 
obtained by the associated press 
the policy towards the church to date can now only be 
continued at the price of using force the 88yearold primate 
wrote through force the crisis will not be solved but deepened 
catholics are conscious of their rights they will demand them 
and are prepared to make sacrifices the cardinal stressed 
relations between the communist authorities and the roman 
catholic church in czechoslovakia have been strained for years over 
the communists refusal to allow any bishops to be appointed in the 
last 15 years 
ten of the countrys 13 sees are vacant a situation the 
cardinal described as catastrophic and the three living 
bishops are all over 75 
last month the vatican and prague authorities reached agreement 
on appointing two auxiliary bishops for the prague archdiocese and 
one titular bishop for trnava in slovakia but these are not full 
bishops 
increasing anger among believers prompted about 500000 to sign 
a petition organized by a catholic lay activist last december to 
demand more bishops more priests and an end to harassment of 
churchgoers 
tomasek gave unprecedented backing to the petition in a letter 
to all roman catholics on jan 4 the staterun media responded 
with strong attacks against the cardinal and the organizers of the 
petition churchgoers in bratislava and other cities reported 
detentions interrogations or other harassment of believers who 
signed or collected signatures 
about 2000 catholics gathered in downtown bratislava the 
capital of slovakia on march 25 to demand religious freedom and 
the appointment of more bishops police drove streetcleaning 
trucks into the crowd to disperse the peaceful rally then used 
water cannons when some protesters didnt leave 
czechoslovak dissidents claimed that several demonstrators were 
beaten by police 
in his letter to strougal tomasek stressed that the petition 
fully complied with a czechoslovak law guaranteeing citizens the 
right to petition authorities and expect a reply 
i welcomed and supported this action because my efforts of 
many years at a normal life for the church and for believers had 
yielded almost no results tomasek said 
he criticized media attacks on the petition and its backers for 
what he called a return to the vocabulary of the stalinist 1950s 
when the cardinal and thousands of other believers and clergy were 
imprisoned 
we demand a change in the position of the state towards the 
church tomasek wrote let us not go further along the path of 
confrontation but move towards a dialogue 
a speech made by a communist official in brno last weekend 
however indicated the party will continue to crack down on 
believers 
south moravian party chief vladimir herman revealed that the 
partys ruling presidium is sending local party cells information 
on the endeavor of some illegal structures to interfere with our 
efforts in churchstate relations 
herman did not specify what illegal structures he had in 
mind 
he charged these were part of an attempt to revert to a 
noncommunist regime and to thwart the partys declared policy of 
reform

nine european nations that profess 
neutrality or nonalignment proposed compromise language friday 
that they hope will lead to a final document at the stalled 
helsinki followup conference 
foreign minister alois mock told reporters the compromise 
contains all the necessary elements of a future concluding 
document for the 35nation conference on security and cooperation 
in europe 
the conference began in november 1986 it is one of several 
called to review compliance with 1975 helsinki accords on military 
security economic cooperation and humanitarian issues signed by 
the soviet union united states canada and all european countries 
except albania 
mock who led the effort by the nine nations said the draft 
offers compromise solutions to those questions which could not be 
resolved by the conference up to now 
mock said it includes some innovative steps to improve 
implementation of human rights provisions including verification 
procedures exchange of information and bilateral meetings to 
discuss violations 
mock said the compromise provides for a human rights conference 
and three followup meetings for contined monitoring 
he said the comprehensive and balanced proposal resulted 
from more than a year of negotiations among austria cyprus 
finland liechtenstein malta san marino sweden switzerland and 
yugoslavia 
a spokesman for the us delegation said privately of the 
proposal we are definitely not ruling it out 
yuri kashlev chief of the soviet delegation described it as a 
positive step 
it may create all conditions for finishing the meeting in a 
couple of months with positive and balanced results he said i 
hope we could do that probably by the end of july 
delegates to the vienna conference have worked since febrary 
1987 on a final document expending upon the original accords 
western nations insist that progress on disarmament and military 
security be balanced by progress on human rights the soviet bloc 
accuses the west of holding security issues hostage to human 
rights 
some western delegates criticized the compromise on human rights 
grounds but mock said 
i dont share the view that the draft falls far short of what 
was proposed originally by the west its a compromise paper 
and compromise means that everybody has to give a little bit 
compared with the original positions

convicted murderer r gene simmons who has 
asked to be swiftly executed had hoped for the death penalty from 
the outset and mounted a defense only because it was his best 
chance to get it his attorney says 
we got what he wanted defense attorney john c harris said 
simmons 47 was convicted of capital murder on thursday and 
sentenced to die for gunning down two people in russellville on 
dec 28 he still faces charges of killing 14 members of his family 
during the christmas holidays 
after the jury recommended lethal injection simmons shocked 
judge john s patterson by publicly forsaking his right to appeal 
patterson today set a hearing for monday to satisfy himself that 
simmons is competent to waive his appeal 
if he concludes that simmons is competent im going to set an 
execution date the judge said 
his mind was made up from the outset for weeks and months we 
have had this bottled up inside of us simmons lawyer said 
thursday night 
in a brief statement read to the court simmons asked that his 
execution be carried out expeditiously i want no action that 
will delay deny defer or denounce this very correct and proper 
death sentence 
simmons said that in his case anything short of death would 
be cruel and unusual punishment i only ask for what i deserve 
let the torture and suffering in me end please allow me the right 
to be at peace 
simmons was found guilty of capital murder five counts of 
attempted capital murder and firstdegree false imprisonment in 
connection with the dec 28 shooting spree the jury deliberated 
less than 1 hours before finding him guilty and another two hours 
before recommending the death penalty 
patterson following the recommendation sentenced simmons to 
die and to 147 years in prison on the other charges 
simmons is to stand trial in july in the deaths of his wife 
four daughters three sons two spouses of children three 
grandchildren and a child officials said simmons fathered by his 
oldest daughter all had been shot or strangled police found their 
bodies when they searched simmons home at dover following his 
surrender in russellville 
killed in the russellville shootings were kathy kendrick 24 
who reportedly had spurned simmons advances a year before the 
shooting and james chaffin 33 described by police as a chance 
victim miss kendrick was shot at the law office where she worked 
chaffin was shot at an oil company 
patterson was not sure whether he had the power to set an 
execution date because arkansas law provides for an automatic 
appeal in death sentence cases attorney general steve clark said 
he thought patterson could set the date 
as an alternative simmons may be required to get a state 
supreme court order defending his right not to appeal and 
compelling patterson to set an execution date 
if he can waive his appeal i say let him waive his appeal and 
go on with it prosecutor john bynum said however he added 
in deathpenalty cases it may be that the interests of the state 
are so great that an automatic appeal will run regardless of what 
the defendant wants 
simmons didnt plead guilty harris said because he felt like 
his best chance of getting the death penalty was to vigorously 
defend arkansas law permits a death sentence only upon a jurys 
recommendation 
simmons lawyers rested his case without calling a witness 
harris said his client never intended to survive this 
ordeal simmons intended to take his life after the russellville 
shootings harris suggested but then did not do so because of 
the trouble he was having killing people he shot seven people 
only two of them died 
harris said simmons realized during the shooting spree that he 
was failing to kill all the people he was shooting at 
i dont think he knew that much about guns

paved road into dirt progress asked one 
the section of route 2a that connects lexington and concord is 
just another highway to most but american history buffs consider 
it a hallowed site 
british troops clashed with the minutemen along the route on 
april 19 1775 in the first battle of the revolutionary war the 
british captured paul revere on the road as they retreated toward 
boston 
supporters of a national parks service plan to restore battle 
road include retired house speaker thomas p tip oneill and 
thomas boylston adams scion of the family that produced two us 
presidents and revolutionary firebrand samuel adams 
oneill lives on cape cod and adams lives in boston 
this is the most important road in america and deserves to be 
treated as such the 78yearold adams said in a recent 
interview likening battle roads significance to already restored 
historic sites like the battlefield at gettysburg 
but few people living and working along the road share adams 
enthusiasm arguing that they may be forced to leave land theyve 
worked for decades 
were history too says kathleen cook whose farm was first 
worked by her husbands grandfather 
i dont consider this progress and most people here agree 
with me said lou snay head chef at the willow pond kitchen in 
concord the last remaining business on battle road you call 
turning a paved road into dirt progress 
under the parks service plan to be made public may 20 traffic 
on most of battle road would be rerouted and the segment would be 
restored to its original dirt state 
trees now crowding much of the unoccupied land along the road 
would be cut to recreate the pastures of revolutionary days the 
crumbled stone walls built by the colonists would be rebuilt to 
waist height 
the parks service has overseen restoration of a dozen historic 
buildings along the roadway since 1959 after being empowered by 
congress to buy much of the property abutting the highway between 
meriams corner in concord and route 128 in lexington 
more modern stores and houses are being razed under lease terms 
that specify state ownership after 25 years or on the death of 
elderly owners 
more than 100 buildings have been torn down since the creation 
of minute man national historical park in 1959 leaving only 
several dozen homes still occupied 
mrs cook said federal officials first told us that we could 
stay in our homes as long as we wanted to and leave them to our 
families but then they decided we had to sell 
she said the family was told the land would be confiscated if 
they didnt 
i probably have seven or eight years left to stay she said 
when asked about her lease id like to stay here but i cant 
so im just taking one day at a time 
her 26yearold son peter gestured from atop his tractor at a 
justplowed field and said theyll keep this like it is but 
theyre tearing down our house because its not old enough guess 
you cant fight the government though 
parks service chief ranger fred szarka declined to discuss 
costs time schedules and other details of the proposed project 
before may 20 but suggested that an alternate roadway might result 
in others losing property 
there are people who think its a terrific idea closing the 
road to all vehicles but i think the issue would be whose 
backyard it the new road is going to go through he said

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ending 
rumors that he had died voted in the final round of irans 
parliamentary elections friday demonstrators burned effigies of 
president reagan and saudi arabias king fahd 
khomeini cast his vote in a special mobile polling booth outside 
his heavily guarded residence in north tehrans jamaran suburb soon 
after polls opened at 7 am 
the revolutionary patriarch is 87 and rarely leaves his 
residence and adjoining mosque iranian staterun television 
monitored in cyprus showed him casting his ballot 
hours earlier rumors swept the hong kong stock market that 
khomeini had died 
in the first round of voting april 8 188 of the 270 seats in 
the majlis or parliament were elected fridays election was to 
fill the other 82 electoral districts including 16 of the 30 in 
tehran where no candidate got a clear majority last month 
candidates are elected to fouryear terms 
irna said final results would not be known until tuesday 
among the 168 candidates fighting it out in tehran and other 
cities were president ali khameneis brother hadi seeking 
reelection in the northeastern city of mashhad he survived a 
grenade attack by leftist guerrillas last year 
another was habibollah asgarowladi an islamic zealot jailed 
for life during the reign of the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi 
for involvement in the 1965 assassination of prime minister 
hasanali mansur 
asgarowladi was freed when khomeini toppled the shah in 1979 
irna said that parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani who 
received more than 13 million votes in april and other khomeini 
aides cast their votes in jamaran after the bearded patriarch 
president khamenei and prime minister hussein musavi voted in 
south tehran mosques which were used as polling stations irna 
said 
they later joined big marches in the capital to mark qods 
jerusalem day proclaimed by khomeini in 1979 to protest israels 
seizure of the arab half of the holy city in 1967 
irna reported that millions of men women and children chanting 
death to israel death to america marched through tehran and 
other cities carrying huge portraits of khomeini and burning 
effigies of reagan and king fahd 
saudi arabia severed relations with tehran last month citing 
terrorism and subversion 
the parliamentary election is the third since khomeinis islamic 
revolution toppled the monarchy in 1979 
the april 8 voting was held amid iraqi missile and air attacks 
on iranian cities but both sides in the 7yearold war have 
observed a ceasefire in the socalled war of the cities since 
april 21 
fridays voting took place amid irans growing isolation 
deepening economic troubles and major military setbacks in the war 
these included the loss of the faw peninsula in southern iraq 
recaptured by the iraqis april 18 after two years of iranian 
occupation and naval clashes the same day in which the us navy 
sank or crippled six iranian vessels 
radicals and moslem extremists were expected to widen the 
sizeable gains they made in april when several leading 
conservatives lost their seats 
the main election issues have been economic and social reform 
the radicals seek centralized state control of the economy and a 
broad spectrum of reforms 
the clericled conservatives who favor a strong private sector 
are supported by the bazaaris the weathy merchant class which 
has survived the revolution 
philip robbins an iran specialist with the royal institute of 
international affairs in london said in a telephone interview that 
the new majlis will be a far more radical body than it was 
before particularly on the important issue of economic policy 
khomeini who wants to see his revolution set on a firm course 
before he dies strengthened the radicals hand before aprils poll 
he delivered a series of edicts widening state powers that 
opened the way for reformist legislation vetoed by the 13member 
council and last year disbanded the islamic republic party the 
conservatives main power base

riot police stormed the sacred temple mount 
complex friday and fired rubber bullets at protesting moslems on 
the final sabbath of the holy month of ramadan twenty arabs and 
three policemen were reported injured 
soldiers closed off large parts of the occupied territories and 
the turnout for moslem prayer services was drastically reduced the

the internal revenue service on friday gave 
writers painters and other artists a partial exemption from a 
provision in the 1986 tax law that had severely restricted 
deduction of expenses of creating their works 
the irs said artists will be allowed to write off operating 
expenses over three years with a 50 percent deduction permitted in 
the first year and 25 percent in each of the next two the rule 
will apply the irs said only where the personal efforts of the 
individual are mainly responsible for the creation of a work of 
art 
the change will allow artists to deduct expenses even before a 
book or other artwork begins producing income it also will free 
artists from a significant amount of recordkeeping and paperwork 
it certainly alleviates the complexity concern these people 
have had tom evans a tax counsel for the treasury department 
told reporters he predicted the ruling will have little effect on 
government tax collections 
bills pending in congress would go even further than the relief 
provided by the irs they would allow artists to deduct all 
creative expenses in the year incurred 
bestselling biographer kitty kelley a leader in the fight to 
overturn the 1986 provision was less than cheered by fridays 
ruling but i guess 50 percent is better than nothing she said 
ms kelley spent four years working on a biography of frank 
sinatra and recalled that under the pre1986 law she was able to 
deduct travel copying government information and similar research 
expenses each year now i am working on a nancy reagan book and 
before todays ruling i wouldnt be able to deduct anything until 
after that book is published she said 
im fairly established but the young writers wont be able to 
stay in business long enough to get their books published she 
said i wonder whether mark twain faulkner or oneill would have 
produced what they did if they had had to operate under these 
rules 
a provision in the giant 1986 tax overhaul was designed so most 
taxpayers would be subject to a basically uniform set of 
requirements for capitalizing or writing off certain expenses 
the catchall change designed to produce about 35 billion in 
revenue over five years generally subjected artists to the same 
capitalization requirements affecting a large retailer or 
manufacturer 
the 1986 law allowed artists to deduct creative expenses only 
after the work produces income that in turn required an artist 
to forecast how much income a work of art would produce in the 
future in cases when an artist was working on two or more creative 
projects simultaneously it required that expenses be split among 
the projects 
thus a writer working simultaneously on a book and a magazine 
story for example would have to account separately for the 
expenses associated with the two projects no expenses of creating 
the works including researchrelated travel and costs of an 
assistant could be deducted until the projects earned money 
freelance writers authors photographers painters sculptors 
and other artists banded together to protest claiming the 
paperwork was an undue burden and that many would have to give up 
their careers since often many years pass before a work of art 
creates income 
the irs said the option is available for artistic expenses 
incurred in 1987 a person who already has filed a tax return using 
the tougher law may file an amended return 
the option may be used by taxpayers who incur production 
expenses associated with films recordings books photos 
paintings sculptures and other fineart products jewelry is 
specifically excluded 
eligible expenses include business travel depreciation 
equipment rental and repair labor and office overhead 
in most cases an artist whose creative output is sold in the 
same year it is produced likely would not excercise the option 
outlined friday that artist probably would continue writing off 
all expenses in the year they are incurred

the nato allies told secretary of state 
george p shultz on friday that settlement of technical disputes 
over the ussoviet arms treaty should spur the senate to ratify 
it before the superpower leaders meet in moscow 
we think the way is now open for the treaty to be ratified 
before president reagan meets soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev on 
may 29 said david mellor a british minister of state 
american and allied officials have expressed concern that 
failure to ratify the treaty before the summit could spoil the 
atmosphere in moscow and set back efforts to reach other arms 
control deals reagan and gorbachev signed the pact in washington 
in december 
shultz briefed allied officials on his two days of talks in 
geneva with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze in 
geneva the two sides resolved differences over how to ensure 
compliance with the treaty 
a further dispute arose after shultz and shevardnadze had 
pronounced the problems resolved and lowerlevel officials on both 
sides argued through the night before settling the matter shortly 
after dawn 
shultz told reporters he was pleased with the outcome but he 
declined to say whether he thought the senate would be satisfied 
the senate on monday postponed debate on the treaty after some 
members accused moscow of backsliding and leaving loopholes for 
possible cheating 
all the issues that anyone has raised have been squared 
away shultz told a news conference before flying back to 
washington 
it is the unanimous view of the allies that ratification prior 
to the summit is very desireable from their standpoint shultz 
said adding that this view was made clear in his meeting at nato 
the treaty calls for elimination of the superpowers 
mediumrange landbased nuclear missiles which have ranges of 310 
to 3100 miles 
shultz also told allied officials in a closed meeting at north 
atlantic treaty organization headquarters that there was no chance 
of the superpowers concluding before the moscow summit a strategic 
arms reduction talks or start treaty cutting longrange missiles 
by half 
he and shevardnadze told reporters the same thing thursday 
mellor said shultz had given nato allies no further insights 
into how long it might take to wrap up a start agreement 
shevardnadze flew to east berlin on friday to brief warsaw pact 
leaders and east german leader erich honecker on the talks east 
germanys staterun adn news agency said shevardnadze told honecker 
he was optimistic the superpowers would achieve substantial 
results in reducing strategic weapons at the moscow summit 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister told 
reporters that his governments central concern was that the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty being considered 
by the senate be ratified and implemented 
genscher said the importance of the inf deal went beyond 
security considerations 
it is also a significant contribution to unity firmness and 
cohesion of the western alliance he said 
the bulk of the missiles to be eliminated by the inf treaty are 
based in west germany the others are in britain belgium and 
italy no weapons that would be affected by a start accord are 
based in western europe 
shultz told reporters he was not troubled by the emergence of 
unexpected disputes with the soviets over inf treaty provisions on 
compliance 
theyre hard bargainers and i guess they keep trying us on 
for size to see if we will let go of things that we thing are 
important and so we i think simply need to follow the 
practice of sticking to our positions when we believe our positions 
are right he said 
the dispute that erupted in geneva on thursday night centered on 
the question of the size of canisters that could leave a soviet 
missile assembly plant at votkinsk without being subject to us 
inspection 
the soviets wanted to increase the allowable length to 677 
feet but in the end both sides agreed on 462 feet an increase of 
264 inches a us official said 
the united states was concerned about missile parts possibly 
being illegally shipped from the plant in canisters according to 
the us official who discussed the matter on condition he not be 
identified

from geneva with the impression that progress and substantial 
results can be made at the moscow summit in all areas that have 
been under discussion 
it said shevardnadze told honecker there is the determination 
on both sides to cut in half the number of strategic nuclear 
weapons as has been agreed in principle intensive work is being 
done in this regard 
adn added that shevardnadze told honecker the kremlin is aware 
that results are expected from the moscow summit which would give 
the process of disarmament and detente a new impulse it did not 
elaborate 
shevardnadze met with honecker soon after his arrival then 
briefed the foreign ministers 
a communique issued by the ministers said they gave their full 
support to the soviet unions efforts in negotiations with the 
united states and voiced hope that the talks between gorbachev and 
reagan will result in the halving of strategic offensive weapons 
and achieve results in other disarmament areas 
after the geneva talks shultz said he and shevardnadze resolved 
a dispute over verification procedures for a treaty eliminating 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles it was signed in december but 
has yet to be ratified by the senate 
foreign minister ioan totu of romania did not attend the 
briefing an east german foreign ministry spokesman said adding 
i dont know why he decided not to come romania was 
represented by its ambassador gheorge caranfil

of the superpowers concluding before the moscow summit a treaty 
cutting longrange missiles by half

north koreas official news agency on friday denied 
japanese allegations that pyongyang helped a japanese terrorist 
return to japan 
the japanese authorities are hurling groundless slanders at 
our republic the korean central news agency said 
japanese police arrested yasuhiro shibata 34 near his tokyo 
apartment last friday after identifying him as one of nine alleged 
red army members who commandeered a japan air lines boeing 727 to 
north korea with 129 people aboard in 1970 
after the hijacking the nine stayed in north korea and 
japanese police and foreign ministry officials said shibatas 
return could only have taken place with the approval of the north 
korean government 
it is a well known fact that several japanese youths belonging 
to the red army group came to our country in the incident of the 
jal plane the news agency said in a report monitored in tokyo 
as they entered the territory of our country the north 
korean government only provided them conveniences for their life 
and treated them as foreigners from the humanitarian stand the 
news agency reported 
as for their going outside the north korean boundary we did 
not mind where they went regarding it as their right proceeding 
from their free will 
the news agency charged the japanese government is trying to 
shift the responsibility for the hijacking to north korea even 
though the japanese government is to blame 
it also said shibata may have wanted to return to japan because 
he was homesick

former white house chief of staff donald t 
regan says that in the confusion following the 1981 assassination 
attempt on president reagan he erroneously told cabinet members 
that presidential press secretary james brady had died 
the president brady secret service agent timothy j mccarthy 
and a washington police officer thomas k delahanty were wounded 
in the assassination attempt outside the washington hilton 
john w hinckley jr was arrested but was found innocent by 
reason of insanity he is in st elizabeths hospital a mental 
institution in washington 
there were erroneous news reports at the time that brady had 
died 
in his new book for the record from wall street to 
washington regan who was secretary of the treasury at the time 
of the attempt on reagans life included what he said were notes 
that he made a few days after the march 30 1981 shooting 
he said in the notes that he received information from the 
secret service which is part of the treasury department and 
relayed it to other members of the cabinet gathered in the white 
house situation room 
an unfortunate message came to me from the secret service and 
it caused confusion and consternation regan said at the end 
of a message describing the presidents condition someone had 
added the words brady died i announced this sad news to a 
stunned group

former presidential spokesman larry speakes gives substantially the 
same account and adds that regan relayed the word to howard baker

police sharpshooters firing from high 
vantage points killed five sikh militants inside the golden temple 
compound friday and tightened their siege taking over about 
onethird of the sacred complex 
about 100 extremists in the temple grounds the holiest shrine 
of sikhism rejected a government demand for surrender 
twentyseven people including at least five civilians have 
been killed since monday when 2500 police and paramilitary 
troopers surrounded the golden temple and its walled compound 
the gunmen inside are part of a separatist movement that has 
waged a terror campaign since 1982 seeking an independent sikh 
homeland in punjab a rich northern agricultural state where the 
sect has a majority thousands of people have been killed 
kps gill police chief of amritsar said government forces 
took control of a narrow road that runs through the complex and 
seized the temple offices and hostel the complex covers the 
equivalent of about five city blocks 
the temple offices and hostel are on one side of the road and 
the temple its residential quarters and the dining hall are on the 
other 
gill said police and troopers controlled all dominant 
features around the compound including a 150foot water tower 
with a sweeping view over the walls which are 20 feet high 
no food or people have been allowed into the temple since the 
siege began and the militants have let no one leave since tuesday 
when about 800 pilgrims were evacuated 
some civilians remained in the compound friday but no estimate 
of their number was available 
government forces and the gunmen inside exchanged intermittent 
fire during the day then police announced over a loudspeaker at 4 
pm that they would stop shooting so women and children could come 
out 
sarabjeet singh deputy police commissioner said the response 
was four shots apparently fired into the air he said a sikh 
gunman was guarding the main gate to keep anyone from leaving 
the siege began monday after sikhs inside shot at paramilitary 
forces outside the complex wounding five officers the 
400yearold golden temple is the political and military center of 
the sikh militants 
killings by the separatists have increased dramatically in 
recent months at least 955 people have been killed in punjab so 
far this year compared with 1032 in all of 1987 
if the government storms the golden temple it risks the wrath 
of many moderate sikhs who would consider the action a desecration 
of holy ground 
prime minister indira gandhi sent soldiers into the temple in 
1984 to dislodge militants and about 1200 people most of them 
sikhs were killed five months later mrs gandhi was assassinated 
by her own sikh bodyguards 
on friday at least three companies of black cat commandos from 
the national security guard joined police and paramilitary troopers 
at the temple a police officer reported 
he said the three companies totaling about 270 men had 
submachine guns and the kind of drills used to bore through walls 
some had rifles equipped with nightvision scopes he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
soon after midnight half a dozen sikhs tried to shoot their way 
out of the temple complex according to gill the police chief he 
said one was killed two escaped and the others apparently 
retreated inside 
how long the militants ammunition and food would last was not 
known but they keep large supplies of both on the grounds 
reporters allowed into the compound wednesday saw many 
containers of water the temple also is surrounded by a vast pool 
in which pilgrims immerse themselves 
sikhs whose men can be recognized by their turbans and beards 
make up only 2 percent of indias 800 million people and punjab is 
the only state with a sikh majority 
they claim discrimination by hindus who account for 82 percent 
of the population sikhism was founded 500 years ago as an 
alternative to hinduism and islam

senate leaders voiced optimism today that the 
anticheating arms control bargain struck by us and soviet 
negotiators at geneva will remove the final roadblock delaying 
debate and ratification of the mediumrange missile treaty 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva said debate 
could begin early next week after a trio of senate committees 
examine the agreements and formally approve them 
they are the experts in their fields byrd said 
commenting after a 90minute luncheon briefing by national 
security adviser colin powell byrd said senate leaders were told 
the agreement was significant and enhances the national security 
of this country 
the briefing was positive and good byrd said 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said it is clear 
byrds decision last week to postpone action on the treaty while 
negotiators addressed concerns that the soviets were backing away 
from effective implementation of inspection provisions played a 
very constructive role 
it did make a difference dole said 
several other senators who attended the briefing also said the 
results of the geneva talks between secretary of state george p 
shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze do seem 
positive and constructive 
im optimistic we can move ahead said sen claiborne pell 
dri chairman of the senate foreign relations committee 
i think at this moment there is more optimism for the passage 
of this treaty than at at any other time during this long 
process said sen john warner rva the ranking gop member of 
the senate armed services committee 
warner said that it appears the soviets agreed to change their 
position on all issues raised by the us side 
im confident my colleagues on monday will come to a similar 
conclusion warner said 
some senators said there is now at least a possibility that the 
senate will consent to the ratification of the treaty by the time 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev convene 
their moscow summit on may 29 
since most vote counts show overwhelming senate support for the 
pact the leading question is whether reagan will have a ratified 
treaty in hand as incentive for the two superpowers to make further 
progress on arms reduction 
byrd said the treaty is too important to national security for 
either him or the senate to be driven by artificial automatic 
arbitrary calendar deadlines 
byrd said he will try to push the treaty through the senate as 
quickly as possible once debate opens but will not guarantee that 
can be done before the summit 
he said he will not permit debate to begin until the onsite 
inspection plan worked out in geneva is examined and approved by 
the foreign relations armed services and intelligence committees 
we were told all the is were dotted and all the ts were 
crossed byrd said of the reagan administrations position on the 
treaty before the latest furor 
it was through the examination of these committees that it was 
found that this was not the case he said 
if we make a mistake in this treaty and we find we have been 
hoodwinked or outsmarted then you can kiss the next arms treaty 
goodbye byrd said lets do this thing right 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the foreign relations 
committee said shultz will testify before that panel monday 
afternoon with the senates bipartisan leadership and the chairmen 
and ranking gop members of the two other committees invited to 
participate 
pell said that if no further snags are uncovered senate debate 
could open tuesday 
earlier this week byrd postponed action on the new treaty until 
shultz and shevardnadze resolved a serious dispute over the 
implementation of anticheating provisions 
the dispute centered on what us inspectors will be permitted 
to see and do as they try to learn whether the soviets live up to 
the requirements of the treaty to eliminate all their mediumrange 
missiles

the united states is encouraged by the 
willingness of lebanese leaders to reach a powersharing agreement 
that would enable orderly elections in lebanon this summer the 
state department said friday 
the remarks by deputy spokesman phyllis oakley marked the first 
time the reagan administration has expressed optimism publicly 
about the fivemonth shuttle that veteran diplomat april glaspie 
has carried out between lebanon and syria 
privately officials cautioned that agreement was not yet at 
hand 
its a very plodding process said one administration 
official who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
ms glaspie is mediating between syrias president hafez assad 
and lebanese president amin gemayel for syrianbacked reforms that 
would grant more political influence to lebanons moslem majority 
gemayel and his christian backers have been reluctant to cede 
their dominance over lebanons political system in which the post 
of president has traditionally been reserved for a christian 
gemayel and assad have not spoken for more than a year 
assad yields broad influence in lebanon because more than 30000 
syrian troops controlling the eastern part of the country and some 
sections of beirut 
i would say were encouraged in our conviction that 
responsible lebanese leaders want to find fair guidelines for a 
process to establish a central government exercising full authority 
over a unified sovereign state mrs oakley said 
in that state all lebanese would enjoy comparable 
opportunities for advancement she said 
accordingly we believe an agreement on such guidelines is not 
only possible but we hope can occur before the presidential 
election this summer she said 
under lebanons constitution elections must be held before 
sept 23 no date has been set gemayel is not running for a second 
sixyear term 
us officials are concerned that unless some arrangement is 
worked out between damascus and beirut elections may be disrupted 
or not held at all in that case they fear the ensuing power 
vacuum might send the wartorn country into anarchy 
the recent fighting in southern beirut between the prosyrian 
amal militia and the proiranian hezbollah faction demonstrates 
the urgent need to restore the authority of a central government 
mrs oakley said 
we abhor the loss of innocent lives and consider tragic the 
new wave of diplaced persons she added 
the latest truce between the fighting factions arranged by 
syrian and iranian mediators collapsed friday

gov mario cuomo on friday vetoed 
restoration of the death penalty in new york friday making it 12 
straight years that capital punishment has been blocked by the 
states chief executive six by cuomo 
assemblyman vincent graber the democraticcontrolled assemblys 
chief death penalty advocate said last week he lacked the votes to 
override the veto 
but state sen dale volker the bills sponsor in the 
republicancontrolled senate said friday that hed attempt an 
override even if one didnt appear likely in the assembly 
cuomo said once again that he would urge the legislature to pass 
his alternative proposal to give life without parole to the states 
most violent criminals 
his predecessor gov hugh carey vetoed deathpenalty 
legislation for six consecutive years until 1982 and cuomo 
subsequently has followed suit 
the last criminal to die in new yorks electric chair was eddie 
lee mays in 1963 federal and state court rulings have since 
rendered capital punishment statutes still on the books in new york 
to be unenforceable 
the legislation would have allowed the death penalty in cases 
where an onduty policeman or prison guard was murdered when the 
murder was committed to prevent a person from testifying at a 
criminal proceeding in murderforhire cases or when the defendant 
committed murder along with another violent felony such as 
kidnapping rape or robbery

it wasnt as lavish as charles and dis but 
when two sesame street characters exchanged vows friday it was 
the wedding of a lifetime at least for those whose lifetime was 
less than 10 years 
eight pairs of eyes were locked on the television set in shirley 
fosters home as maria and luis got married in the season finale of 
the childrens program 
as in most sesame street segments there was a lesson to be 
learned 
love is when somebody likes another person and they decide to 
get married said shemeka fennell 7 who had the day off from 
school and got to join the group at mrs fosters house in new york 
city 
its when you like somebody in a special way chimed in john 
davy 9 
big bird looks nice said brandon taylor 5 who noticed 
that the leggy yellow character looked well different big bird 
wore a giant turquoise flowered tie 
ernie and bert look nice too brandon said they wore 
tuxedo shirts and bow ties 
cookie monster in a relatively crumbfree shirt and tie and 
oscar the grouch resplendent in a garbagesplattered tuxedo also 
were on hand 
the show presented various preparations for the big event while 
maria and luis expressed cold feet in song the fuzzy red muppet 
elmo the ring bearer was concerned only with whether he would 
drop the rings 
the story line evolved after actress sonia manzano who is 
married in real life told producers she and her husband were 
thinking about starting a family and wondered how this would affect 
maria her sesame street character 
the answer was to have maria get married the first wedding in 
the shows 19 years 
one of the major questions we were faced with was what do 
preschool children know about love and marriage and would they be 
interested said valeria lovelace the shows director of 
research 
she said the decision to go ahead was made after researchers 
found no books no journals no articles on preschoolers 
conception of love 
there were books on divorce but they didnt really address 
the issue of love and why people get married ms lovelace said 
we really felt there was a void 
some 90 manhattan preschoolers questioned by researchers chose 
kissing hugging and picking flowers as behaviors of loving 
ms lovelace said but they just didnt have any verbal responses 
for it 
we wanted to give them that verbal information that marriage 
is a promise love is a very special feeling 
and so maria and luis fell in love the courtship began last 
christmas when they found a sick kitten and luis played by emilio 
delgado nursed it tenderly back to health maria was smitten 
over the tv season the relationship developed showing children 
different stages of love including handholding kissing hugging 
and even arguing all leading up to maria and luis wedding day 
the show produced by the childrens television workshop was 
taped in november and aired on public television stations 
nationwide friday 
the pintsized viewers who gathered at mrs fosters home gave 
the affair a thumbs up except for 19monthold ryan holder 
he snored through the hourlong show

syrian troops clashed with iranianbacked 
fundamentalists on beiruts airport highway friday in the first 
syrian intervention in the battle over south beirut six people 
were reported killed 
the ashshiraa magazine said the iranianbacked guerrillas have 
spirited foreign hostages who are believed held in the slums of 
south beirut from one hiding place to another to prevent their 
liberation 
the fight between the syrian troops and hezbollah guerrillas 
came as hezbollah pushed syrianbacked amal fighters out of one 
slum neighborhood police said 
hezbollah guerrillas moving behind a heavy barrage of 
howitzers fought deep into the raml elali section and seized the 
mosque of the great prophet from amal troops a police spokesman 
said 
the rival militias battled with tanks mortars and 
rocketpropelled grenades over the area which abuts the main 
beirut airport highway 
hezbollahs victory brought portions of the airport and the 
airport highway controlled by the syrian army within the armys 
firing range said the spokesman who under standing rules cannot 
be named 
shortly thereafter a hezbollah sniper killed an aide of a 
senior syrian officer on the highway 
a group of hezbollah fighters clad in iranian flags over their 
battle fatigues later attempted to cross the highway the syrians 
opened fire and killed five hezbollahis the spokesman said 
all roads to the airport were closed but planes continued to 
land and take off even though stray bullets whizzed over the 
runways and tarmac 
we shall wipe out any attempt to reestablish any militia 
presence in any syrianpoliced territory and shall crush any 
encroachment on our lines or soldiers said brig gen ali 
hammoud commander of the syrian contingent 
the syrians maintain a 7500strong contingent in moslem west 
beirut until friday they had stayed out of the hezbollahamal 
confrontation but the warned they would not tolerate any attack 
against them 
police said amals positions in the slums were rapidly falling 
one after another into hezbollahs hands after the fighting broke 
out at 1 pm 
in all police said 10 people were killed and 18 wounded in 
fridays fighting which ended a 36hour truce one of several 
ceasefires brokered by syria and iran the figure included those 
killed in the syrianhezbollah battle 
the overall toll was 198 killed and 561 wounded since the 
confrontation for control of the 16squaremile shantytown began 
last friday 
lebanons ashshiraa magazine said the blindfolded foreign 
hostages were taken last saturday to the house of sheik ibrahim 
alamin the spokesman for hezbollah which is believed to hold 
most of the 18 hostages including nine americans missing in 
beirut 
ashshiraa a beirutbased weekly said the hostages were moved 
to alamins house in a relatively safer south beirut area but it 
did not name the neighborhood where the house is located 
shiite sources speaking on condition of anonymity said 
alamins house is about 50 yards from the residence of sheik 
mohammed hussein fadlallah hezbollahs spiritual leader 
the weekly which was the first to report the secret us arms 
sales to iran in november 1986 cited no sources and the report 
could not be independently verified 
alamin was not available for comment hezbollahs press office 
in south beiruts district of bir elabed did not answer telephone 
calls 
ashshiraa has good sources in the iranian government and among 
the shiite community in lebanon but many of its recent reports on 
foreign hostages have not panned out 
amal arabic for hope accused hezbollah of using the fourday 
truce called by presidents hafez assad of syria and ali khamenei 
of iran to prepare for the latest onslaught 
police said the personal representatives of assad and khamenei 
syrian brig gen ali hammoud and iranian deputy foreign minister 
hussein sheikholeslam were holding talks with delegates from the 
two warring factions at the iranian embassy 
hezbollahs fighters won control of 70 percent of the slums 
before the latest ceasefire was proclaimed wednesday police said 
fridays drive left only the shiyah district under amals control 
meanwhile christian militia leader samir geagea a proisraeli 
foe of syria was reported friday to have escaped an attempted 
assassination by a car bomb in lebanons christian heartland north 
of beirut

a boy was sentenced on his 17th birthday to 
five consecutive life terms in prison after pleading guilty but 
mentally ill to five murders 
clinton bankston jr will be eligible for parole in 25 years 
clarke county district attorney harry gordon said thursday 
bankston told clarke county superior judge joseph gaines i 
want to tell you judge im sorry i killed those people 
bankston laughed loudly as he was escorted from the courtroom 
his attorney edward tolley said the laugh under stress is 
symptomatic of his clients mental illness 
bankston pleaded in the april 1987 stabbing deaths of retired 
university of georgia professors glenn and rachel sutton in their 
home and the august hatchet slayings of sally nathanson 59 her 
daughter helen 22 and mrs nathansons sister ann orr morris 
63 
bankston was 15 when the suttons were killed and 16 at the time 
of the other murders 
tolley said he decided to enter the plea because evidence of 
both guilt and mental illness were overwhelming and because of a 
recent georgia supreme court decision barring execution of people 
who were under age 17 when they committed their crimes

ireland has agreed to resume extraditing terror 
suspects to britain after a fivemonth disagreement over 
procedures the attorney generals office said friday 
the governments long have been at odds over the irish republics 
reluctance to extradite people sought for trial in connection with 
the irish republican armys bloody campaign to drive the british 
from northern ireland 
britain has refused to abide by an irish extradition law that 
took effect dec 1 it requires london to provide detailed 
evidence including names of witnesses to support warrants and 
empowers the irish attorney general currently john murray to pass 
on all extraditions 
prime minister margaret thatcher called the legislation a step 
backward that would make it harder for britain to secure 
extradition of ira suspects 
under new arrangements the british attorney general sir 
patrick mayhew will send a summary of evidence and his irish 
counterpart will decide on a casebycase basis whether 
suspects should be arrested mayhews office said in a statement 
irelands government declined comment on the new procedures 
which news reports said were agreed upon earlier this week when 
mayhew and murray met in dublin 
mayhews office said the irish attorney general has modified 
certain stipulations which in the united kingdoms view went beyond 
the requirements of the legislation 
the irish have accepted the validity of british concerns that 
there must be no prejudice to the administration of justice in any 
eventual proceedings in the united kingdom on the return of the 
fugitives 
we understand that the irish attorney general has already 
authorized the backing of warrants in one particular case under the 
new procedure 
relations between the governments have deteriorated in recent 
months because of several disputes over the quality of british 
justice 
those include the british appeal courts refusal to grant a 
retrial to six irishmen serving life sentences for twin bomb 
attacks that killed 21 people in 1974 the six claim they were 
convicted on the basis of faulty forensic evidence and confessions 
that they claim were beaten out of them

the state of the economy seems almost 
too good to be true less than seven months after the stock market 
plunge business leaders said friday 
the business council composed of 61 executives from the largest 
us corporations predicted modest growth low unemployment and 
moderate inflation this year in a report issued at its meeting at 
the homestead resort 
the economy and our businesses are doing quite well in spite 
of that problem said john f akers chairman of international 
business machines corp referring to the oct 19 stock market 
crash nobody is talking about that anymore 
in fact the economic forecast of the business group which 
represents the consensus of member corporations chief economists 
paints a more optimistic picture than the prediction issued just 
before the crash 
the business executives projected somewhat slower growth in the 
economy as measured by the gross national product 24 percent 
this year compared with a forecast of 3 percent made when they last 
met in early october 
but they said both inflation and unemployment will be lower than 
they thought seven months ago and that growth will be more balanced 
than the 38 percent expansion in 1987 
a buildup in inventories contributed almost one percentage point 
to last years growth that is expected to moderate with increased 
exports and spending by businesses on new equipment filling in the 
gap 
consumer spending although growing at half of the 4 percent 
annual rate of the early 1980s is expected to hold steady through 
1989 providing room in the economy for the production of exports 
i dont want to go on record saying the crash was a good 
thing but there were certainly good aspects to it said john s 
reed chairman of citicorp the nations largest bank holding 
company 
it relieved an unhealthy buildup of tensions in the financial 
markets and provided the worlds central bankers an opportunity to 
lower interest rates reed said 
but underlying the optimism was a sense of unease among some 
executives that they attributed to two of the principal problems 
blamed for causing the crash the federal budget deficit and the 
trade deficit 
many of us continue to feel we must be living on borrowed time 
to be having such good business conditions when the underlying 
fundementals are so questionable said edmund t pratt jr 
chairman of pfizer inc a diversified health care company 
the stubbornly high trade deficit will drop from a record 1712 
billion in 1987 to less than 150 billion this year the executives 
said 
but they said that will not be enough to prevent a further slide 
in the dollar which has already lost half its value in two years 
when measured against the japanese yen the executives said the 
dollar now trading at about 125 yen will drop to 115 yen by the 
end of next year 
the budget deficit was predicted to remain disturbingly high 
at 154 billion in 1988 up from 1502 billion in 1987 
clearly nothing will be done about it in an election year 
said robert d kilpatrick chairman of cigna corp an insurance 
company 
the executives report also sounded a warning about rising 
interest rates major banks this week raised their prime lending 
rate from 85 percent to 9 percent 
too much economic growth could produce an unavoidable rise in 
interest rates and a recession before the end of 1989 it said 
however willard c butcher chairman of the chase manhattan 
bank said he was not overly concerned about the increase in the 
prime rate and said rates may fall back slightly by the end of the 
year i think were overdoing fears of inflation he said 
the business council saw consumer prices rising 39 percent in 
1988 down from the 44 percent rate in 1987 it said unemployment 
which was 54 percent in april would remain under 6 percent 
through 1989 
opening their twoday meeting the executives were briefed in 
private by commerce secretary c william verity and us trade 
representative clayton yeutter other speakers on the scheduled 
included sen alan k simpson rwyo the assistant republican 
senate leader and sen pete v domenici rnm the ranking 
republican on the senate budget committee

a boston housing court judge may become a topic of 
conversation at this months ussoviet summit because a 
defendants wife wrote to soviet officials that the judge had 
treated her husband unfairly 
judge george e daher got a call this week from the state 
departments human rights bureau asking for details of a case in 
which he jailed james lynch a boston man who reportedly cursed him 
and charged the bench 
the mans wife virginia wrote to the soviet embassy in 
washington complaining that his rights had been violated 
us officials fear the letter could end up on the agenda of the 
moscow summit daher said thursday 
i cant believe they will raise this as a civil liberties 
issue samuel kreiter the human rights bureau staff member who 
talked to daher said if it does come up it wont last very 
long we have evidence she and her husband were afforded due 
process 
daher said lynch was not denied his rights 
any time the russians want to play back the tapes of the 
hearing well gladly play them back he said his due process 
rights were protected 
im so proud of our judicial system we can stand the scrutiny 
from the russians or martians or anyone i am sure the russians can 
learn from it daher said 
lynch appeared before daher last october after officials 
complained he was violating city codes by operating an auto repair 
shop out of a residential garage 
daher dismissed the case after the city dropped the complaint 
but court records indicate lynch began arguing with police officers 
as he was walking out of court 
daher reprimanded him and lynch swore at him and charged the 
bench according to the records 
daher ordered lynch to undergo psychiatric evaluation and when 
he was found mentally competent sentenced him to 90 days for 
contempt of court 
the judge freed lynch for christmas and canceled the rest of the 
sentence 
it was after lynch was released that his wife wrote to the 
soviets 
she was fired as a police officer in 1981 after being found 
unfit for duty records show she sued the city contending she 
had a nervous breakdown from being harassed by colleagues after 
reporting three officers beat a handcuffed prisoner 
she got a 93000 settlement in court this year but officials 
said she had not picked up the check she also was reinstated as an 
officer but placed on disability leave 
last dec 27 pravda the communist partys daily newspaper 
published an article about mrs lynch under the headline help 
virginia lynch 
the newspaper said she was the victim of unjust repressions 
and that police behaved themselves like gangsters for firing 
her

a nicaraguan rebel leader 
acknowledged that dissidents are seeking to oust their military 
leader col enrique bermudez but played down reports of an 
uprising within the ranks 
in an interview thursday night contra spokesman bosco matamoros 
also accused the nicaraguan government of fueling the discontent 
and criticized the united states for not being a better ally 
matamoros said a small group of dissidents wrongly accused 
bermudez a former national guard commander and the ranking contra 
military leader of cronyism and corruption 
the usbacked rebels are fighting to overthrow the leftist 
sandinista government which has been in power since 1979 
some reports have said that up to 4000 fighters were engaged in 
a mutiny at a contra base camp in yamales 20 miles north of the 
honduran border 
thats one of the most fantastic things ive heard 
matamoros said 
the reports could not be independently confirmed because 
honduran authorities barred journalists from traveling to the 
isolated region 
according to the spokesman only 726 combatants were at the base 
sources claimed some of the contras charged bermudez with 
corruption and inefficiency matamoros acknowledged there were 
gripes but said reports of a rift in the rebel movement were 
exaggerated 
they have the legitimate right to differences of opinions 
matamoros said but from that to conclude that the organization 
is at the breaking point would be to ignore the fact that this 
organization has 17000 men 
the sandinista government in nicaragua claims there are 6000 
contras other sources say there are up to 10000 
bermudez and civilian contra leaders pedro joaquin chamorro and 
maria azucena ferrey met with the troops at yamales this week 
there is not a climate of confrontation there the spokesman 
said 
the apparent rift was highlighted last week after honduras 
deported seven contras to the united states matamoros said the 
soldiers were deported becaus they were publicly discussing rebel 
issues a sensitive point for the hondurans who for years have 
barely acknowledged the existence of the base camps 
one of the dissidents diogenes hernandez membreno known as 
comandante fernando reportedly evaded the authorities and fled to 
yamales which until last year was the contras strategic command 
post matamoros said he was briefly detained by hernandez 
membrenos troops along the road to the camp sunday 
matamoros said the grumblings about bermudez surfaced last 
month in response the joint chiefs of staff sent a letter april 
20 requesting a meeting to discuss the allegations that letter he 
said was followed by one two days later from the council of 
commanders made up of the 27 regional commanders 
the spokesman said three contras hernandez membreno walter 
calderon and tirzo moreno responded in a letter april 26 that their 
allegations were not unfounded but did not elaborate 
they say they oppose bermudezs authority but there is no 
material proof just allegations matamoros said 
matamoros said the council of commanders would make the final 
decisions regarding the allegations bermudez could be removed only 
by the fivemember national directorate headquartered in miami 
the internal problems come at a time when the contras are 
attempting to work out a permanent truce with the sandinistas to 
end the more than sixyear war both sides have made little headway 
since they signed a temporary ceasefire agreement march 23 
the 60day temporary ceasefire started april 1 
the two prosandinista newspapers in managua have been giving 
frontpage displays to the contra squabbles 
the ceasefire pact called for the rebels to move into seven 
zones in exchange the sandinistas would allow them to receive 
supplies and send representatives to take part in national talks to 
resolve some of the nations problems the government also was to 
gradually release more than 3000 political prisoners

the reagan administration contending that 
many contra rebels inside nicaragua are desperately short of food 
will begin sending them cash at the rate of about 1 a day per 
rebel for food purchases it was announced friday 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley brushed aside 
complaints from house speaker jim wright dtexas that the rebels 
might use the money illegally to buy weapons 
they already have weapons what they need at this moment 
desperately is food and were confident that they will naturally 
use these small funds to provide for their basic survival she 
said 
an agreement signed between the contras and nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government on march 23 permits humanitarian aid for the 
rebels but no shipments have been made thus far because of a 
dispute over how the assistance should be delivered among other 
reasons 
meanwhile many contras inside nicaragua were said to be 
suffering from an inadequate diet as an interim measure the 
administration about three weeks ago began arranging deliveries by 
truck and air drop of food to rebel camps in honduras near the 
nicaraguan border 
hundreds perhaps thousands of contras have fled nicaragua for 
honduras in search of food in recent weeks 
officials from the agency for international development in a 
preliminary discussion with reporters of the plan announced friday 
had said monday that most of the aid will be in the form of 
nicaraguan currency delivered by contra couriers based in honduras 
some food also will be delivered but the emphasis will be on 
cash transfers because of limits on the amount of food that can be 
carried 
aid was designated to manage the 48 million humanitarian aid 
program approved by congress in late march a week after the 
contras and the sandinistas reached a truce agreement that allows 
for such aid to the rebels 
the secretary general of the organization of american states 
joao baena soares has criticized both deliveries of food to contra 
camps in honduras and the cashforfood plan 
baena soares a member of a verification commission assigned to 
ensure compliance with the contrasandinista agreement has said 
that neither plan falls within the limits of what the two sides 
have approved 
but an administration official said wednesday that the other 
member of the commission nicaraguan cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo has raised no objections to the cashforfood plan 
the administration has accused the sandinista government of 
using delaying tactics during negotiations in a bid to starve the 
contras into submission 
but nicaraguan vice president sergio ramirez said thursday his 
government is willing to allow immediate delivery of humanitarian 
supplies to rebels in nicaragua he denied that the government is 
trying to starve the contras 
we are in full disposition to accept that the contra forces 
could receive humanitarian aid inside nicaragua tomorrow if 
possible ramirez told reporters after a 1hour meeting with 
wright and other democratic congressional leaders 
ramirez did not discuss his views on the cashforfood plan 
wright has described the plan as a last resort because there 
are no guarantees the money wont be used to buy weapons he also 
expressed concern that the cash might be used to buy weapons in 
violation of both the contrasandinista agreement and the terms of 
the 48 million aid package 
the package provides for food clothing shelter and medical 
supplies as well as treatment for children who are war victims 
money also was set aside to finance the work of the verification 
commission

answers while they were still jotting down the questions in the 
final frenetic rounds of a contest called mathcounts 
seeded fifth he made short work out of five contestants he 
faced oneonone by correctly answering 10 of 11 questions doing

british critics are throwing brickbats at the 
royal shakespeare company after several poorly received productions 
at home and the belated broadway opening of its musical carrie 
which was panned 
the rsc is a national asset i think its time to sound the 
alarm john peter wrote in the sunday times after giving bad 
reviews to two new productions in the companys home theater at 
stratforduponavon william shakespeares birthplace 
peter who had harsh words for the new stagings of shakespeares 
much ado about nothing and william wycherleys the plain 
dealer wrote there was a time not that many years ago when 
you could look to the rsc for expertise excellence and 
enjoyment 
now he said the royal shakespeare company is in trouble 
michael billington of the guardian said the stratford season had 
an unnervingly shaky start of six productions since march 30 
only across oka a new play by robert holman received 
favorable reviews 
negative reaction to carrie in new york probably will 
generate further talk of a decline peter lamented the prolonged 
devotion of director terry hands to a show the critic called 
frightful 
in 198455 hands productions of much ado about nothing and 
cyrano de bergerac took new york by storm but he spent much of 
the past year on the rock musical adaptation of the stephen king 
horror novel carrie opened may 12 at broadways virginia 
theater after several delays 
the 7 million musical received some sharp notices in new york 
and its initial reception in stratford in february was harsher 
still several critics wondered in print whether the company had 
lost its sense of purpose 
michael coveney in the financial times said carrie was 
enjoyable in a masochistic way and decried hands participation 
in an utter cultural vacuum of dance studio robotics with a hint 
of cultural and classical pretensions 
hands has fared little better in the nonmusical area his 
productions of shakespeares julius caesar and jean genets 
the balcony were received with little enthusiasm 
in an interview with the associated press before taking 
carrie to new york he said i know it is fashionable for 
everybody to know how to run the rsc and therefore to use their 
pens and their newspapers to demonstrate their own particular area 
of special interest 
he said the company has a tradition of music theater linked 
to the extensive use of music in shakespeares plays more 
recently the royal shakespeare won plaudits and profits with les 
miserables which premiered at the barbican in october 1985 and 
swept new yorks tony awards last june 
a trade newspaper the stage said in the companys favor 
personally and in spite of the somewhat spiky personalities of 
certain people in charge of its affairs we have a good deal of 
sympathy with the rsc to maintain that the rsc should be wound up 
as one or two of our readers suggest is unthinkable the royal 
shakespeares output is formidable it opened 39 productions in six 
theaters in 198788 and will open 37 this year all of broadway 
averages about 30 shows a year

house and senate negotiators neared agreement 
friday on a 11 trillion fiscal 1989 budget but the senates main 
spending committee voted to ignore it 
the budget negotiators deadlocked a month past their deadline 
were near approval of a plan that would delay a decision on whether 
to add more spending for the space program or for education 
with the senate favoring more for space and the house more for 
education the budget proposal being circulated friday would leave 
the matter unresolved minimum amounts would be set for broad 
spending categories and a pot of 500 million would be left 
uncommitted 
a house vote on the compromise was expected next week but the 
budget normally an important guidepost for congress production of 
its annual spending bills was taking the appearance of a 
procedural exercise 
last falls deficitreduction agreement with president reagan 
created in the wake of the stock market crash preset the overall 
totals for domestic military and foreign aid spending the house 
and senate spending committees eager to finish their work this 
election year have gone ahead without the budget blueprint to 
divide up the domestic pie 
the house appropriations committee this week sent to the full 
house three of the 13 annual appropriations bills using its own 
vision of how domestic spending should be allocated 
on friday the senate appropriations committee approved a set of 
priorities sticking more closely to president reagans budget than 
the one passed by the senate 
the committee approved a proposal drafted by sens bennett 
johnston dla and dennis deconcini dariz to reject the 
budgets tight restraints on water projects and interior programs 
and cut back on health education and poverty programs 
senate budget committee chairman lawton chiles dfla also a 
member of the appropriations panel offered an amendment to shift 
money back to the budget priorities but was defeated 1411 
water projects are important but i thought education was 
important i thought health was important he said 
sen lowell weicker a liberal republican from connecticut said 
in the past he was always fighting against the white house but now 
it was the democraticcontrolled congress providing less money for 
education and aids research 
now i can train my guns on your party and not my own he 
said 
johnston who has been running the appropriations committee for 
the ailing sen john stennis dmiss said his proposal reflected 
the senates priorities better than the budget which he called 
virtually meaningless 
he claimed the senate did not understand the spending plan when 
it approved it last month 
the committee was relying on the budget resolution only for 
technical definitions of how to comply with the deficitreduction 
agreement with reagan johnston said 
one of those technical disputes was settled friday when 
lawmakers and the white house tentatively agreed to allow about 
19 billion in total domestic spending beyond the level first 
envisioned in the presidents budget 
both the house and senate budgets had sought to expand spending 
by redefining some domestic accounts so they would not count 
against the spending caps the white house agreed to accept the 
senate level which allowed slightly less new spending than the 
house plan 
the added spending would put the fiscal 1989 budget closer to 
violating the grammrudman deficit reduction law although exact 
figures were not available friday budget aides said if the deficit 
swelled only 2 billion to 3 billion more the spending plan might 
hit the 146 billion threshold for triggering automatic spending 
cuts as required by grammrudman

the general assembly urged the united 
states on friday not to close the plo observer mission which 
represents the palestinian people at the united nations 
in a 1362 vote israel and the united states were the only 
countries to oppose the resolution calling on the united states to 
allow the palestine liberation organization mission to operate 
under an international treaty 
it was the third time since march the general assembly had sent 
the united states such a message 
the united states is seeking a federal court order to close the 
plo mission the united nations considers the mission the sole 
legal representative of the palestinian people at the 159member 
world body 
the plo is invited to speak on all middle east issues but it 
cannot vote 
the resolution calls on the united states to honor the usun 
headquarters treaty of 1947 requiring it to allow all un 
missions including the plo representative to operate and 
discharge official functions 
but a us antiterrorism law passed by the congress in 1987 
requires closure of the plo mission and is in conflict with the 
treaty 
the international court of justice in the hague last month 
decreed that the united states is obligated to take the plo dispute 
to court the united states has defied the court order 
plo ambassador zehdi labib terzi told the assembly that 
international law must take precedence over domestic legislation 
can the un headquarters in the usa still be able to 
discharge its responsibilities fully and effectively if its host 
country is violating the headquarters treaty terzi asked will 
missions accredited to the un be able to function 
independently he asked

a 300 expense check that blew out of a 
broken airplane window will complete its trip to cleveland the 
conventional way through the us mail 
the check was in robert j yaromas suitcoat in the back of a 
small plane flying at 16000 feet monday night when a rear window 
blew out on the flight from philadelphia to cleveland the jacket 
and his raincoat were sucked out of the plane 
on tuesday a worker mowing the grass at a former nuclear fuel 
reprocessing plant about 30 miles south of buffalo spotted the 
check said mickie andrus a spokeswoman at the west valley 
demonstration project which is cleaning up the site 
a plant security official traced the check to yaroma an 
investment counselor who lives in the cleveland suburb of westlake 
and first spoke to his wife she just couldnt believe the check 
was here ms andrus said 
later yaroma called back he was just very very polite and 
couldnt thank us enough he even wanted to send our security 
official a reward ms andrus said 
yaroma said the coats are still missing 
i figured my suitcoat is on the back of some cow or hanging in 
a tree he said 
when the plane window blew out thunderstorms were moving across 
northeastern ohio and into pennsylvania and western new york the 
airplane landed safely at cleveland without further incident and 
nobody was injured yaroma said 
donald wuerch meteorologist in charge of the national weather 
service office at buffalo said i suspect the check was probably 
caught up in a thunderstorm line that moved through the area it 
was probably caught in the atmospheric turbulence with its 
updrafts and downdrafts until the storms died down monday night 
and the check settled to earth over western new york 
ms andrus said the check was in surprisingly good condition 
it had the stub on it and everything she said 
because the check was found in an area where lowlevel 
radioactive waste is stored underground it was tested for 
radioactivity and found to be safe before being mailed back to 
yaroma she said

business sales climbed 19 percent in march 
the largest advance in more than a year while the buildup of 
business inventories slowed the government reported friday 
the commerce department said total business sales rose to a 
seasonally adjusted 4795 billion in march it was the largest 
advance in 13 months and followed an equally strong 11 percent 
rise in february 
business inventories were up 03 percent to 720 billion the 
smallest rise since last august inventories had grown by 04 
percent in february and 07 percent in january 
analysts said the combination of booming sales and the slowdown 
in the growth of inventories should translate into continued 
strength in factory orders and production in the months ahead 
the 03 percent rise in inventories included a tiny 01 percent 
increase in unsold goods at the retail level a 02 percent rise at 
the manufacturing level and a 06 percent increase at the wholesale 
level 
david wyss an economist with data resources inc said the fact 
that inventories were rising at the wholesale level meant part of 
the buildup was occurring in imported goods and thus any needed 
production cutbacks in this area would not hurt domestic 
manufacturers 
michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm attributed 
the small increase in retail inventories to the success car 
manufacturers have had with their sales incentives at reducing 
backlogs of new cars 
the 19 percent rise in total sales was the largest increase 
since a 41 percent jump in february 1987 
it included a 17 percent rise in sales at the retail level 
however the government reported thursday that retail sales fell 
06 percent in april as bad weather and an early easter cut into 
demand 
sales in march at the wholesale level were up 08 percent while 
sales by manufacturers rose 26 percent 
the combination of rising sales and slower growth in inventories 
left the inventorytosales ratio at 150 in march down from 153 
in february that means that it would take 150 months to exhaust 
inventories at the march sales pace

two sanitation workers who found a stash of cash 
in a barrel of trash turned in the 48900 and were rewarded with a 
thank you thats all 
the garbage collectors are not entitled to a nickel of the loot 
410 100 bills and 158 50s neatly bound with rubber bands which 
they found during regular pickup rounds thursday in an alley in the 
borough of queens 
under state law if the finder is an officer of new york state 
or a public corporation he or she is not entitled to money found 
in the performance of their duty police sgt john clifford said 
friday 
and instead of kind words the dogooders have been ridiculed by 
people who think they were chumps to turn in the money 
we have been getting calls that have been derogatory said 
donald koubek their supervisor theyve been called dummies 
stupid jerks 
the two who joined the department in 1969 and 1970 have 
refused to talk to reporters and their names have been withheld 
according to vito turso a sanitation department spokesman 
they have taken their fair share of ribbing from people who 
try to second guess what they did turso said but they did the 
right thing they followed department regulations and they are to 
be commended but at this point they are being commended 
anonymously 
koubek admitted its tough to choose between kind words and cold 
cash 
its what i would call a sanitation workers dream he said 
still i think most people would turn it in after a little bit of 
thought these guys had no other thought than to turn it in they 
immediately called their garage and i was notified 
koubek said that among coworkers they are getting more 
positive reaction than negative 
so far no one has claimed the cash clifford said 
there is no indication that the money was illgotten the bills 
were not marked the serial numbers were not consecutive and they 
were not counterfeit 
as far as i know its not ours said marianne bosted of the 
two bundles of bills that fell out of a trash can thursday in the 
alley behind her house 
i keep saying to my aunt are you sure you werent saving 
this in a box to give to me ms bosted said

while some youngsters plan to be spending 
their summer playing at the beach others will be sifting through 
the mud in search of ancient relics thanks to a program for 
budding archaeologists 
the university of west florida hopes its 1988 summer youth 
archaeology program will encourage youths to enter the field and 
will teach them the basics of literally digging into the past 
its dirty but its also exciting as archaeology gets said 
uwf associate anthropology professor judy bense who heads the 
schools office of archaeological research 
it isnt pretend or showcase the most important aspect about 
this project for youth is they get a chance to see real 
archaeology she said 
between june 20 and july 8 15 to 20 youths will help excavate 
and do lab analysis of artifacts recovered from previous digs of 
american indian and european culture sites 
pensacola lays claim to being the secondoldest continually 
occupied american city behind st augustine and is rich in 
artifacts actually spaniards settled pensacola first in 1559 
but then abandoned it for a few years letting the title slip to 
the atlantic coast city settled six years later 
the summer session costs 150 
the program aims to give special attention to students who show 
an interest in archaeology as a career said ms bense who became 
interested in her lifes calling when she attended bay county high 
school in panama city another florida panhandle town 
it had everything to do with the teacher we had she recalls 
of her earliest interest he opened our eyes to the fact that 
just because you are in panama city which essentially is nowhere 
and went to bay county high school which was a soso school 
didnt mean you couldnt be an archaeologist 
and there are seven archaeologists with phds from that tiny 
little town she said adding that she hopes to similarly inspire 
pensacola students 
ms bense said shes optimistic about that happening 
there are a couple that are real young that are really 
eager beavers that i really think may be budding 
archaeologists she said

two giant pandas from the peoples republic 
of china were making their way to the toledo zoo on friday amid an 
international war of words over whether the animals were being 
exploited 
toledo zoo officials called the dispute a slap in the face 
to the chinese 
in washington us district judge norma johnson refused 
thursday to grant a temporary restraining order being sought by the 
world wildlife fund and the american association of zoological 
parks and aquariums those groups sought to prevent the pandas from 
being shipped by air from shanghai 
but the judge said she would hold a hearing next week on a 
preliminary injunction that if granted could send the pandas back 
to china or restrict how the zoo can display them 
the pandas le le and nan nan were to arrive in toledo shortly 
after midnight friday and go on display by may 24 they are 
scheduled to spend at least 100 days at the zoo 
the zoo which has spent nearly 3 million preparing for their 
visit gave the chinese about 300000 in equipment and technical 
help in exchange 
in the suit the wildlife fund and the zoological association 
said exhibition of the pandas violates an international convention 
that prohibits trafficking in endangered species for commerical 
purposes 
we think the fish and wildlife service proceeded in a very 
hasty and inappropriate manner said ken cook executive director 
of the world wildlife fund 
he said the exhibition would increase the demand for such 
transactions from other zoos and hurt the effort to breed pandas 
meanwhile the blade of toledo reported friday that a 
highranking chinese wildlife official said he might never again 
allow pandas to come to the united states without a full apology 
from the us government for what he considers a breach of 
sincerity and mutual trust 
the newspaper said li gui ling secretary general of the china 
wildlife conservation association told members of the toledo zoo 
delegation traveling with the pandas that he is insulted by policy 
questions leveled at china by the fish and wildlife service the 
agency which issued permits for the visit and was named as a 
defendant in the federal court suit has questioned the way china 
uses fees it charges for panda loans 
the wildlife fund has been pressuring the wildlife service to 
stop what it calls chinas rentapanda policy until china can 
prove it is using those fees for panda conservation efforts 
at the same time edwin bergsmark president of the zoo board 
and head of the zoos panda delegation told the blade his lawyers 
had filed a countersuit against the wildlife fund in federal court 
in washington 
pandas are the national symbol of china and long have been 
regarded by the chinese as an ultimate gesture of good will trust 
and friendship

a 10yearold schoolyard preacher who said 
hed rather get gold and silver up in heaven than an education 
down here was suspended a fourth time friday after refusing to 
stop proselytizing and go to class 
duffey strode wearing a black jacket and carrying a zippered 
case apparently containing a bible spent 20 minutes on the grounds 
of eastfield elementary school quoting scripture and hurling 
biblical epithets in a steady rain before assistant principal 
shirley ramsey handed out the suspension 
duffeys younger siblings matthew 5 and pepper 6 also have 
been suspended for defying school officials earlier this month in 
this western north carolina town their mother robin stode said 
they also will likely be suspended again when they return to school 
may 19 
mrs strode predicted the dispute would wind up in litigation 
its gone too far now she said adding that she has 
contacted an attorney through the rutherford institute which she 
described as a nonprofit christian legal foundation based in 
manassass va 
mrs strode said the family moved to north carolina in january 
1987 after winning a lawsuit against city officials in a 
pennslyvania town who had tried to prevent her husband david from 
street preaching 
we came here to relax after winning the fight she said of 
their earlier legal problems in chambersburg pa all we want is 
to have the right the freedom to preach we might lose it some day 
and we want to preserve it 
strode a machinist and the children preached at high school 
football games from a pickup truck last fall and strode has been 
seen proselytizing in business areas around town 
mrs strode said it was her childrens decision to preach 
i told them if they want to go back and preach thats fine 
mrs strode said in an interview at home friday as duffey and his 
sister watched a videocassette of the goonies matthew stopped 
playing with a basketball long enough to nod his head when asked if 
he planned to preach again when his suspension ends 
earlier when asked if he felt pressured by parents duffey had 
said no they aint i want to do it 
after the first suspension we asked them to stop preaching 
for a couple of days mrs strode said it just about broke 
their hearts 
the strodes battle with eastfield elementary began earlier in 
the spring strode said his sons had preached three or four 
times outside the school before duffey was suspended on march 29 
after refusing to be paddled for a scuffle with three other 
students the fight apparently concerned duffeys preaching 
duffey was suspended a second time for five days for refusing to 
stop preaching on april 22 his third suspension for 10 days was 
april 28 
mrs ramsey said students and teachers alike are showing signs 
of stress at duffeys outbursts in which he has called faculty 
members whoremongers queers fornicators and 
adulterers 
it bothers them the teachers it gives the reputation of the 
school and their reputation personally as being attacked she 
said if i had to go into a classroom right after that im 
afraid i wouldnt be worth a great deal 
she said parents have told her their children come home feeling 
upset she also said the boys behavior friday may have been fanned 
by media attention 
duffey arrived friday morning by bicycle in a pouring rain to 
about 40 reporters and camermen awaiting his arrival and two 
satellite dishes erected on the front lawn 
when mrs ramsey asked him to enter the school he began 
thou shall not take the name of the lord thy god in vain thou 
shalt not commit adultery youre guilty even your eyes are filled 
with adultery men cant keep their eyes off women and women cant 
keep their eyes off men adulterers shall be put to death and their 
blood shall be upon them 
ignoring further pleas to come inside he said id rather get 
gold and silver up in heaven than an education down here 
his mother told him to go inside and hand in his homework which 
he did emerging five minutes later with the letter of suspension 
the letter did not mention preaching but said duffey was 
suspended for being insubordinate refusing to abide by school 
policies refusing to go along with mrs ramsey into the school and 
disruptive behavior 
mrs strode said the letter gave no indication about what future 
action would be taken against duffey if he continued preaching upon 
his return 
i guess the same thing will happen she said

helping the worlds largest population of 
refugees return to their homes in afghanistan will require a 
mammoth international effort against huge logistical and political 
odds according to a congressional study of the problem 
the transition will be complex and problematic but 
possible concludes the report from the senate judiciary 
subcommittee on immigration and refugees 
sunday marks the official beginning of the withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan under accords signed april 14 in geneva 
which subcommittee chairman edward m kennedy dmass called 
the first glimmer of peace for the people of afghanistan in 
nearly nine years 
the accords call for half the soviet troops to be pulled out of 
afghanistan by aug 15 and for the pullout to be completed by feb 
15 1989 
the congressional report said it was likely that no major 
movement of the estimated 5 million refugees who fled their country 
into pakistan and iran would occur before this fall or next spring 
for the very reason refugees flee their homelands conflict 
violence and political strife they are not likely to return until 
those conditions are resolved the report stated 
the panel hailed pakistans program to handle the refugees 
including support from the united nations and said it easily could 
be converted into a repatriation mechanism but it will face major 
challenges in providing food supplies seeds and farm implements 
and medical care inside afghanistan 
therefore the un and the international community must be 
prepared to function within afghanistan to the maximum degree 
possible even in the absence of clear governmental authority 
the committee concluded 
it noted that the political situation was likely to remain 
volatile and that the current sovietbacked regime of najib may 
resist repatriation particularly since most refugees oppose the 
government 
some afghan resistance leaders also may hinder the relocation 
efforts in an attempt to use the refugees as political leverage 
the panel said 
costs of such a largescale repatriation program have been 
estimated from as low as 46 million to a high of 15 billion the 
report noted the united nations has put the cost of returning 2 
million refugees the number expected to participate in a un 
program at about 226 million 
working to the advantage of the repatriation effort is the fact 
that some 80 percent of the refugees previously resided within 
about 150 miles of the border in rural agrarian communities 
the vast majority of the refugees will return to retill the 
lands their families have farmed for generations the report 
noted 
it is likely that many refugees will be able simply to walk 
home it said 
but the challenges are daunting the subcommittee said 
officials in the region are particularly concerned about large 
numbers of land mines and other explosives still buried throughout 
afghanistan 
and roads needed to haul supplies and food to returnees and the 
irrigation systems needed to support agriculture once they return 
will have to be rebuilt it said

after two delays scientists successfully 
detonated a powerful nuclear weapon friday 1500 feet beneath the 
desert floor at the nevada test site 
the third announced nuclear test of the year went without 
incident shaking the remote desert site 85 miles northwest of las 
vegas and registering 50 on the richter scale at the national 
earthquake information center in golden colo 
it was pretty goodsized but some register as much as 60 
said bill schmieder a geophysicist at the center 
the weaponsrelated test had a yield of up to 150 kilotons the 
largest allowed under existing treaties with the soviet union 
the energy department said the test went smoothly with no 
apparent release of radiation 
it appears to be a success said department spokeswoman 
barbara yoerg everything was contained underground 
ms yoerg said ground motion from the explosion was not felt at 
the blasts command center 13 miles from ground zero 
seven soviet scientists who are staying at the site while 
preparing for joint verification experiments sometime this summer 
were not allowed to monitor the blast the spokeswoman said they 
stayed in mercury a small settlement 40 miles away 
the energy department had warned managers of highrise buildings 
in las vegas about 85 miles away to keep workers out of 
precarious positions because of possible ground motion 
the weapon was buried 1500 feet beneath the surface of yucca 
flat when detonated at 835 am it was classified as having a 
yield of between 20 and 150 kilotons 
the test was initially set for wednesday but was delayed a day 
because of winds it was postponed again thursday after a security 
safeguard designed to prevent accidental explosion froze and 
scientists were unable to detonate the weapon 
five demonstrators gathered at a boundary to the site about 45 
miles from ground zero to protest the test ms yoerg said the 
demonstration was peaceful 
the blast codenamed shellbourne was the third announced test 
of the year at the nations nuclear proving grounds and the 678th 
since testing at the desert site began in 1951 
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on 
seismographs every increase of one number means a tenfold increase 
in magnitude 
a ground quake of 35 on the richter scale can cause slight 
damage in the local area 4 moderate damage 5 considerable damage 
6 severe damage a 7 reading is a major quake capable of 
widespread heavy damage 8 is a great quake capable of 
tremendous damage

socialist premier michel rocard said friday that 
national assembly elections must be called soon because centrist 
leaders are refusing to support his new government 
i have the feeling that we should hardly delay rocard told 
a news conference he said president francois mitterrand 
reelected sunday to a sevenyear term had not yet decided whether 
to dissolve the assembly and call early elections 
in a television interview later rocard said mitterrand would 
finish his consultations on the question saturday an 
indication that a decision could come over the weekend 
the constitution gives the president the power to dissolve the 
assembly and call new elections 
if we do not dissolve that would mean the government of the 
french republic does not have a majority rocard told antenne 2 
television 
the current 577member assembly elected for five years in march 
1986 has a centerright majority that backed the conservative 
government of jacques chirac who resigned tuesday after losing the 
presidential election to mitterrand 
before the election mitterrand had said he wanted a new 
socialistled government to try to work with the current assembly 
but rocard said he sought support from centrists in the assembly 
for his new government and received a public negative response 
the leadership of the centrist union for french democracy 
decided at a meeting this week to stay aligned with the right 
the socialists control only 211 seats so rocards government 
would be constantly in danger of falling if it lost an important 
vote 
there was increasing speculation that elections could be held in 
midjune the first possible date 
the calendar leaves barely two weeks for the decision if the 
tworound elections are to be held before the end of june 
mitterrand must dissolve the assembly before may 30 
no one seriously considers holding elections during the 
traditional vacation months of july and august when many french 
people leave home for weeks and pay little attention to the news 
the newlyappointed french cabinet dominated by senior 
socialist party leaders joined rocard for the first time at the 
presidential elysee palace on friday mitterrand appointed his 
cabinet on thursday night amid speculation that it was transitional 
and would not last 
all key posts went to wellknown socialists many of them 
members of the previous socialist government in power from 1981 to 
1986 
of the 26 full ministers 17 are socialists 
interior minister pierre joxe said mitterrand had wanted to draw 
centrists into the government but leading centrists wary of 
participating in a socialist government had declined cabinet posts 
mitterrand and rocard managed to woo over only three centrists 
two ministers and a deputy minister none with a significant 
political base of his own

a supreme court justice friday refused to 
block a 4835 million judgment awarded trans world airlines 
against a company formerly run by the late howard hughes 
justice william j brennan denied an emergency request by summa 
corp and william r lummis administrator of the hughes estate to 
suspend the judgment pending a formal appeal to the full court 
the delaware supreme court on april 4 upheld the award in a case 
that began in 1962 
summa corp formerly called hughes tool co or toolco owned 78 
percent of the stock of twa when it was sued by other twa 
shareholders 
the minority shareholders said twa which hughes founded was 
denied an opportunity to be competitive and profitable because 
toolco refused to allow the airline to purchase its own jets in the 
1950s twa was forced to lease jets and buy some from toolco the 
suit said 
for reasons clearly attributable to the eccentric or 
idiosyncratic business methods of howard hughes twa was unable to 
establish a jet fleet as quickly as its competitors the delaware 
supreme court ruled 
it upheld a lower court ruling that awarded twa more than 172 
million plus interest of about 311 million 
the case is summa corp vs twa a859

a federal judge voiced concern friday over 
whether a 65foot latin cross erected more than 20 years ago at a 
marine base in hawaii is an unconstitutional endorsement of 
religion by government 
us district judge thomas f hogan made no ruling on a lawsuit 
against the cross presence at camp hm smith but he expressed 
doubts about the governments contention it served the purely 
secular purpose or honoring marines killed in the vietnam war or 
are missing in action 
the court has concerns over the legitimacy of the cross 
hogan said at the conclusion of a hearing on the issue there is 
not a case where a cross has ever been accepted by federal courts 
as a permissible symbol on government property 
the jewish war veterans of the usa contends that the wooden 
cross on a prominent point at the marine base violates the 
constitutions ban on governmental endorsement of a particular 
religion 
the groups lawyer ronald koerner said the latin cross cannot 
be considered a secular object because it is the symbol of the 
passion death and resurrection of jesus christ 
it is one of the great ironies of the case that the government 
has taken a profoundly religious symbol to devout christians and 
turned it into a secular symbol koerner said 
here a particular religion or a particular view is accepted a 
minority religions view is disregarded he said nonchristian 
war dead are not honored by the cross he added 
will nonchristian people have the right not to enter military 
service because they are accorded no respect honor and dignity 
koerner said 
justice department attorney frederick morgan did not deny the 
religious significance of the latin cross but he said the 
history of the memorial is clear it was erected as a secular 
monument 
although courts have ruled that latin crosses on government 
property are impermissible morgan said the hawaii case is 
different because it involves a cross that is part of a war 
memorial 
there is no religious purpose here he said 
but morgan conceded under questioning by judge hogan that his 
argument would be harder to prove if the cross were a crucifix a 
representation of christ on the cross that is a common symbol in 
the roman catholic church 
hogan noted a marine press release issued in 1983 stated that 
the original cross was built in 1966 for an easter sunrise service 
but morgan questioned the accuracy of the press release which he 
said was disavowed in deposition testimony by marine officials 
including a former base chaplain 
hogan also noted that the press release referred to the cross 
being rebuilt after a fire in time for it to be lit at christmas 
morgan said the cross located on a high point of land from 
which it can be seen at sea has become a beacon of hope for the 
community and a landmark 
when there was a move to take it down three years ago the 
marine base received 3200 letters from local residents who wanted 
cross kept where it was morgan said only one writer called for 
its removal he said 
the cross has been a source of controversy for several years 
in 1985 the navys judge advocate general rear adm thomas e 
flynn ruled that the cross presence on the base was 
unconstitutional and recommended that it be removed 
marine commanders ordered its removal but gen px kelley 
then the marine commandant countermanded those orders 
in the margin of a routing slip attached to flynns opinion 
kelley wrote and the cross came crashing down victory for the 
forces of evil 
kelley now retired said during a deposition taken in the case 
that he was merely referring to lawyers as the forces of evil 
kelleys order keeping the cross was issued after retired lt 
gen victor krulak wrote to say he had erected the cross in the 
mid1960s as a monument to marines killed or missing in action in 
vietnam 
the supreme court ruled in 1984 that the city of pawtucket 
ri could erect a creche that depicts the nativity scene in a 
park along with other symbols of christmas such as reindeer 
since that decision however the high court has left 
undisturbed court rulings by federal judges that ordered the 
removal of crosses from municipal buildings in st charles la 
and birmingham ala in both cases the lower courts held that the 
crosses which stood alone were undiluted religious symbols that 
should not be displayed on government property

an american specialist tangled with his 
soviet colleagues friday over the consequences of telling those 
exposed by the chernobyl nuclear accident that they face a greater 
risk of developing cancer 
many people in kiev worry about what will happen to them they 
dont want to have children said robert gale a us doctor who 
helped treat the sickest victims of the april 26 1986 accident at 
the nuclear power station 80 miles north of here 
the american specialist a spectator spoke at the end of a news 
conference by soviet specialists winding up a threeday meeting on 
the medical effects of the accident 
gale urged a widespread discussion of the possibility of future 
cancer deaths as well as other medical problems as a result of 
the accident that has already killed 31 people 
i believe a healthy discussion ranging from no effects to 
millions of effects is good he told the conference 
participants 
an explosion and fire at the no 4 reactor of the plant exposed 
thousands to high levels of radiation and released a cloud of 
radioactive material that eventually circled the world 
gale said wednesday that specialists calculated the chernobyl 
accident could add as many as 30000 cancer deaths to the 600 
million expected worldwide in the next 50 years 
but he stressed the number was based on calculations only he 
said he thought that the projections were high perhaps even 10 
times too high 
soviet scientists say they are dealing with a widespread fear 
among their citizens about the dangers of nuclear power that they 
have termed radiophobia and they complain that forecasts like 
gales contribute to it and threaten the future of the soviet 
nuclear power industry 
the scientists also acknowledged that rumors of another accident 
at the chernobyl plant sometimes spread around the region 
viktor knizhnikov head of a soviet radiation safety laboratory 
said gales initial projections of chernobyls health consequences 
made on soviet television after the accident contributed to 
anxiety of the people 
on wednesday leonid ilyin director of the soviet institute of 
biophysics said rejection of nuclear power reflects a lack of 
understanding of reality of today when there is no alternative 
but gale said the way to control the fear of nuclear power is to 
prevent nuclear accidents and nuclear war 
soviet nuclear power officials who were severely criticized in 
the west for not providing more timely information about the 
chernobyl accident also are reeling from sharp criticism published 
april 24 in the official communist party newspaper pravda 
for months official soviet publications had nothing but praise 
for the cleanup effort at chernobyl but pravda said the plant was 
plagued by poor workmanship nepotism and drunkenness 
officials said friday that some of the criticism was true of 
work in the 18mile exclusion zone around the plant but not in the 
plant itself 
in another development a government spokesman said friday that 
the head of a commission that investigated the accident committed 
suicide a day after the second anniversary of the disaster 
the april 27 death of valery a legasov 52 was unrelated to 
his work said alexander p kovalenko information hief of the 
government agency overseeing the power station in the northern 
ukraine 
why only he knew kovalenko told reporters visiting agency 
headquarters his suicide depended on psychology we should not 
connect it with work 
legasov had been praised for his openness in discussing the 
accidents causes and effects

thirteen members of the friday the 13th club 
sought to bring good luck to the reading terminal market friday by 
breaking seven mirrors and dancing under a ladder with raised black 
umbrellas 
the idea is to spoof the whole idea of friday the 13th bad 
luck said club member ed wohlmuth who teaches fashion 
merchandizing at the art institute of philadelphia 
but the club which began its celebration at the market at 1213 
pm has its own superstitions 
max buten did only two spins under the ladder with his umbrella 
any more than that is bad luck he said 
fridays meeting the clubs second this year and 90th since its 
founding in 1936 was designed to aid the reading market which is 
located beneath a huge train barn last used as a commuter rail stop 
two years ago 
we want this place to survive wohlmuth said of the reading 
market which has been mentioned as the possible site of a 
convention center where else in america do you have a farmers 
market in the middle of a city 
bob boyle executive vice president of the reading real estate 
co which manages the market joined in the antisuperstition 
ceremony he said he wasnt sure whether the clubs antics would 
save the market but he added it cant hurt 
the club founded in 1936 by philadelphia ad man harry klein is 
exclusive membership is by invitation only and is limited to 13 
you have to wait for somebody to die to get in wohlmuth said 
he also said the club has set its own expiration date friday 
the 13th of october 1988 to give the world a break 
club members conceded bad luck had struck occasionally wohlmuth 
said the club helped initiate an aquarium in south philadelphia in 
the mid1960s the aquarium closed by the end of the year then 
there was the time they were invited to initiate a new subway 
station below the market that night they had stalled trains in 
the tunnel recalled member henry klein brother of the founder 
but who knows on this friday the 13th a city council committee 
recommended limiting city support for the costly convention center

willie b found its a jungle out there 
zoo atlantas famous gorilla saw something friday he hasnt seen 
since he was captured in africa 27 years ago green grass beneath 
his feet and open sky above his head 
as reporters and photographers watched from behind trees and 
across a protective moat the 30yearold lowland gorilla stepped 
hesitantly into his new outdoor quarters a 45 million simulated 
rain forest where he will live near 13 other gorillas and a host of 
other apes 
skeptical of those watching him he spent almost an hour 
stepping back and forth from his enclosed shelter before he seemed 
secure enough to run atop his hill scamper for food and begin 
ripping down tree limbs 
i think he has responded well he came through he seems to be 
enjoying his environment beaming zoo atlanta director terry 
maple said 
last month willie b was moved from his tilewalled 
steelbarred cage his home since he arrived at the zoo in 1961 
into the new indoor quarters he will use for sleep and shelter 
after five weeks to grow accustomed to the enclosure with his 
keeper of 14 years often sleeping nearby to keep him company he 
was allowed to roam free zoo officials dont know if he can 
remember being outdoors 
in a physical last month willie weighed in at 460 pounds about 
60 pounds overweight but not too bad after 25 years in a cage 
maple said 
for now willie will live in an area of his own adjacent to 
three families of gorillas on loan from emory universitys 
yerkes primate research center theyre all separated to prevent 
fights zoo officials hope that within a year he can be introduced 
to another gorilla probably a female with whom they hope hell 
breed 
the new exhibit according to zoo atlanta officials is the most 
advanced gorilla habitat at any zoo named the ford african rain 
forest and built with 1 million from the automaker its the 
latest stage in a 26 million renovation at the 99yearold zoo 
the exhibit will open to the public june 11 
just four years ago the us humane society named the zoo one 
of the nations worst the us department of agriculture slapped 
sanctions on the zoo for poor recordkeeping on animal care the 
deaths of star animals made national headlines and political 
turmoil gripped the cityowned attraction 
in 1985 maple a georgia tech animal behavior specialist who 
helped turn around the new orleans zoo was named director and 
operations were handed to a nonprofit agency maple took to 
calling zoo atlanta the worlds next great zoo and proceeded 
to convert the old facility into a modern natural animal habitat 
its a great day for zoo atlanta maple saidas of this 
moment we have arrived as a bigleague zoo 
plans call for a complete renovation by 1991 with animals 
roaming in natural habitats rather than cages 
as for willie b friday was not his first time in the 
limelight in 1981 an atlanta tv station handed him a suitcase to 
recreate a popular luggage commercial which showed an ape bashing 
but not breaking the product 
willie ripped the leather cover off the suitcase ripped the two 
sides apart from the hinges filled one half with water and drank 
from it

hearings into a fatal train wreck raised 
serious questions on working conditions and equipment safety in the 
rail industry a ranking national transportation safety board 
official said friday 
james l kolstad the boards vice chairman whos heading a 
panel investigating the jan 14 conrail accident in thompsontown 
said new testimony and data from previous accidents clearly 
suggest that irregular and unpredictable shift work is 
fatigueproducing and detrimental to safe railroad operations 
the board will issue a report in about seven months on the 
accident in which two trains collided headon killing the 
engineer and brakeman on both 
scheduling train dispatchers without work breaks also is unsafe 
kolstad said as three days of hearings concluded 
early in the hearings witnesses said dispatchers often cannot 
leave their computers to eat or go to the bathroom because no one 
else is experienced enough to relieve them 
r b hasselman a conrail vice president said the company 
indeed promotes safety in its scheduling practices 
and pat linskey a conrail spokeswoman in philadelphia cited 
exhibits submitted to the board that the engineer and the brakeman 
on the one train that apparently ran a stop sign before the 
accident both had had a break of nearly 38 hours since their 
previous work assignment 
an industrial psychologist said during the hearings that he 
reviewed the crews work schedules and concluded they were overly 
tired and fell asleep while running the train 
kolstad also called on the industry to improve the working 
environment and safety of locomotive cabs adding industry 
studies have been under way for improvements in these areas without 
producing significant results 
he said a committee representing the interests of industry 
unions and the federal government has failed to initiate any 
substantial safety changes in locomotive cabs 
donald lindsey vice president of the brotherhood of locomotive 
engineers said recommendations for important safety changes have 
fallen on deaf ears 
lindsey said train manufacturers should improve the interior cab 
by decreasing the noise level to prevent hearing loss changing the 
heating and cooling systems and padding the interior to better 
protect employees in case of an accident he said locomotives also 
need exterior changes such as stronger and larger crash equipment 
and measures to prevent the cab from being crushed if it rolls over 
during an accident 
the companies dont want to put the money out lindsey said 
after his testimony it would range anywhere from 6000 to 
16000 for each cab and the industry doesnt want to spend that 
kind of money 
william bogett an official with general motors which makes 
locomotives said the committee on improving locomotive cabs is 
wellintended but often makes recommendations that are unrealistic 
he said the committee has been asked to do the impossible 
make a highspeed locomotive withstand the impact of another 
locomotive

american jazz trumpeter chet 
baker famed for his 1950s appearances with gerry mulligan died 
friday after falling from the second floor of his amsterdam hotel 
baker 59 fell from the hotel window shortly after 310 am 
and was found dead in the street by police according to amsterdam 
police spokesman klaas wilting 
no precise reason for bakers fall was disclosed 
baker was scheduled to make several appearances as part of a 
tour of the netherlands 
the jazz trumpeter was born chesney baker in yale okla in 
december 1929 his early career contained phenomenal luck which 
turned very sour 
famed for the thin cool tone of his trumpet playing baker set 
the the standard for what jazz buffs knew as the cool school 
in 1952 he was working with charlie parker on the west coast 
when he joined mulligan a baritone saxaphonist and the rest of 
his pianoless quartet 
in 1953 baker topped the metronome trumpet poll and started his 
own quartet his work became more assured and outgoing in 1955 he 
took a group to europe that showed high promise then his career 
started to suffer from narcotics arrests headlines and a 
backlash against the fact hed been overrated at the beginning 
he had a cult following in the 1950s because of his good looks 
and youth and his fragile and introverted tone he looked something 
like james dean and sounded something like bix beiderbecke as a 
player miles davis was his main inspiration 
in recent years baker said he had stopped taking drugs and 
started making records again appearing on an elvis costello album 
he sang sometimes in a rather weak voice but was appealing to 
female audiences 
in san francisco in 1968 baker he was the victim of a beating 
by hoodlums and suffered severe injuries that included loss of his 
teeth a terrible thing for a trumpet player for two years he 
didnt play 
in 1974 critic john s wilson wrote in the new york times that 
had developed more range and assertivedness within the wistfully 
ruminative style with which he has also been associated

the soviets have lost control of a 
nuclearpowered military spy satellite and two american experts 
said friday it will shower the earth with radioactive debris 
the satellite kosmos 1900 has been in a steadily decaying 
orbit for the last month if nothing is done to correct its orbit 
it will decay and reenter the earths atmosphere said maj alex 
mondragon a spokesman for the us space command in colorado 
springs colo 
tass the official soviet news agency reported that kosmos 1900 
has a nuclear power plant aboard and would fall to earth in august 
or september but that the radioactive material on board would not 
present a danger 
however two american experts on the soviet space program james 
oberg and nicholas johnson said it was unlikely that the 
radioactive material would burn up on reentering the atmosphere 
as tass implied 
it is a certainty that the radioactive debris will come down 
the question is where said johnson author of the annual study 
soviet year in space he said it was likely to fall in the 
ocean or in a sparsely populated area 
we will know the date a few weeks before but we wont know 
the exact time or general area until a few hours before johnson 
said the orbit of kosmos 1900 covers the earth between 65 degrees 
south and north latitude excluding only antarctica in the south 
and a swath in the north bounded by the inhabited areas of alaska 
greenland scandanavia and siberia 
johnson and oberg said the satellite is believed to have a 
system to eject the reactor core so that it would burn up rather 
than reach earth but that safety system did not activate after the 
soviets lost contact with kosmos 1900 between april 10 and april 
14 johnson said in an interview 
you could set that system up on a failsafe system to eject 
as soon as the satellite stopped working he said but it would 
have activated shortly after the malfunction 
neither tass nor the us space command spokesman described the 
mission of kosmos 1900 but oberg and johnson said it was a rorsat 
an englishlanguage designation which stands for radar ocean 
reconnaissance satellite they are used to monitor the movement of 
us warships 
two other soviet rorsats have fallen to earth 
in january 1978 kosmos 954 powered by 110 pounds of uranium 
reentered the atmosphere and spread radioactive debris across 
canada the class was then redesigned to allow the reactor to be 
jettisoned so that it would not have the protection of the 
satellite body as it reentered the atmosphere and thus would be 
more likely to burn up 
one of the newly designed rorsats kosmos 1402 dropped from 
orbit on jan 25 1983 over the indian ocean and no radioactive 
debris is known to have fallen to earth 
in the case of kosmos 1402 said johnson the core was ejected 
very shortly after the malfunction in contrast to the current 
situation 
a top soviet space scientist roald sagdeyev told a news 
conference in washington that kosmos 1900 was designed so that the 
radioactive material would vaporize and remain in orbit but he 
said he had been in the united states for several weeks and did not 
have fresh information on kosmos 1900 
sagdeyev who is director of the soviet space research institute 
and an adviser to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev was appearing 
with the private federation of american scientists to urge a ban on 
nuclear reactors in orbit 
sagdeyev and frank von hippel of the american federation said 
that the proposal was aimed largely at crippling the us star 
wars program which many scientists say would use nuclear 
reactors to power lasers and other exotic weapons to knock down 
intercontinental ballistic missiles 
sagdeyev said the only knowledge he had of the rorsat program 
came from what he read in western publications 
the tass announcement made available by the agencys office in 
washington said that the artificial earth satellite kosmos 1900 
with a nuclear power plant aboard was launched dec 12 1987 
according to competent soviet oranizations radio contact with 
the satellite was lost in april 1988 the satellite is continuing 
in its oriented flight and the main service systems are 
functioning according to the program 
the satellite will fly in orbit until augustseptember 1988 
after which it will cease to exist the satellite kosmos 1900 has 
systems insuring radiation safety on completion of the flight 
tass said 
the soviets have launched about 50 rorsats two of them have 
fallen to earth kosmos 1900 is on the way down while kosmos 1824 
remains in low orbit the remainder have been boosted into higher 
orbit where there is less danger they will fall acording to oberg 
and johnson 
oberg and johnson said the soviets apparently have developed a 
new type of ocean reconnaissance satellite a followon to rorsat 
one that uses solar rather than nuclear power 
the development of a rorsat replacement that does not rely on 
nuclear power would explain the soviet decision to call for a ban 
on reactors in orbit 
they are willing to give up something they are about the scrap 
in return for something we have not built said oberg

the governors of mississippi louisiana 
and arkansas signed an agreement aboard a mississippi river barge 
friday to wage war on poverty in the region and work together to 
woo foreign business 
gov ray mabus of mississippi said the three states for too long 
had left untapped the potential of their rich delta areas and not 
claimed our fair share of the prosperity that is america 
if we are successful the country succeeds mabus said we 
cannot have a truly vibrant country if we have pockets of despair 
if there are places which do not fully share in the american 
dream 
mabus along with govs buddy roemer of louisiana and bill 
clinton of arkansas signed an agreement to work together to 
promote friendly and working relations with foreign countries in 
the areas of international trade industry technology and tourism 
education and culture 
their pact also aims to improve conditions in the impoverished 
agricultural flatlands along the river the governors did not 
specify how they would fight poverty and said the details would be 
worked out later 
together we can do so much more our problems are bigger than 
a single state roemer said 
political and business leaders and japanese ambassador nobuo 
matsunaga joined the governors for the barge trip from the port of 
rosedale to the main river channel where the agreements were 
signed 
the governors said the agreements would not end competition 
among the three states but represented a realization that big 
investors decide first on a region and then a specific site 
we have always assumed that if mississippi won something 
arkansas lost it clinton said that is not so states in good 
shape are parts of regions in good shape 
we can do so much as a team we are too poor to compete 
individually mabus said

the king of the witches for 25 years is dead and 
his designated heir has fled 
so the witchcraft council of elders which claims 100000 
members in britain and thousands of adherents worldwide voted 
unanimously not to pick a successor 
alex sanders was the first formal king of the witches in about 
500 years said council spokesman high priest nigel bourne 
the witch king who died earlier this month at age 61 decreed 
in a tape recording played at his funeral that his 16yearold son 
victor should succeed him as king said his widow maxine 
but his son apparently has no interest in the job and has gone 
to live with friends in the united states she said 
in any case she suggested perhaps a king is no longer needed 
the council of elders voted to that effect thursday night 
in the old days you had a king of witches because the crops 
wouldnt grow because the country was in danger or at war or 
something like that she said 
after a period of seven years he would be sacrificed in 
modern times we dont sacrifice them but nobody in their right 
mind wants the job it is not necessary at this time the crops 
are doing very nicely the babies are doing nicely 
the sanders family clearly regard their brand of witchcraft as 
the white or benevolent sort 
geoffrey dickens a conservative member of parliament told the 
house of commons last month that he believed witchcraft was 
sweeping the country and endangering children he said many people 
convicted of offenses against children had been involved in 
witchcraft initiation ceremonies

the agents who made the deal that will 
bring singer michael jackson to 150 million soviet television 
viewers via pepsi cola ads operate out of a 200yearold farmhouse 
on a dirt road here 
the jackson spots to be broadcast next week will be the first 
paid american commercials on soviet television 
were a very small outfit said david nussbaum of global 
american television inc a big name for the little television 
production company housed in the hills of western massachusetts 
global americans founders pam roberts and ed wierzbowski seem 
to have found an unlikely place for bigtime wheeling and dealing 
in their 1780 house with a halffinished addition and two young 
children underfoot 
but they had the inside edge a long and trusting relationship 
with the soviet unions primary tv network nussbaum said friday 
the companys only fulltime employee nussbaum is also helping 
build the addition watch the children write scripts and negotiate 
other commercial deals 
we would rather be helping share ads for sweet drinks than 
bombs nussbaum said 
the company has worked with the governmentcontrolled soviet 
network gosteleradio since 1982 on such projects as citizens 
summit a talk show featuring phil donahue and his soviet 
counterpart vladimir pozner linked by satellite 
wierzbowski landed in moscow on friday and went immediately to 
soviet studios to begin editing pepsi ads including two featuring 
jackson all the ads have already appeared on american television 
among other tasks he must put the company logo and slogan 
choice of a new generation into cyrillic script those 
distinctive russian letters and add a soviet voiceover narration 
the ads are to appear next tuesday through saturday on five 
onehour broadcasts of pozner in america in which the soviet 
commentator talks with americans on such topics as us family life 
and attitudes toward soviets 
roberts and wierzbowski began their business with amateur 
videotapes of protests at the seabrook nuclear power plant in new 
hampshire and moved on to documentaries including one on a uranium 
plant strike in tennessee 
in 1982 they began traveling to the soviet union for 
dialogue a documentary on the visit of 40 americans to 
siberia that film gave them the idea for a live conversation 
between soviets and americans that became citizens summit 
when gosteleradio decided to air pozner in america it 
turned to roberts and wierzbowski for help in choosing an 
advertiser to defray the costs 
they know us nussbaum said simply 
he wouldnt reveal financial details of the deal but the going 
rate was reported to be 10000 for a 30second ad 
the amounts of money weve gotten are not large amounts by 
the standards of american markets nussbaum said but the 
soviets will be receiving currency and thats what they want 
interestgenerating currency with which to expand their programs 
several us companies that sell products in the soviet union 
were approached but pepsi was the natural choice since the 
company pioneered in marketing there nussbaum said the soft drink 
has been sold there since 1974 
a company spokesman said a pepsi ad ran on soviet television 
during telecasts of the 1986 goodwill games but that commercial 
aired free of charge

district attorney norm early 
it sent a very definite clear easytohear and appropriate 
message early said 
all but the two theft charges against wortham brought 
consecutive sentences 
after reciting what hufnagel described as worthams sordid 
record the judge said the record is devoid of any positive 
contributions to family or society 
worthams criminal record dates back to 1972 and included 
numerous arrests for burglary and theft and two earlier counts of 
sexual assault he was on parole at the time of the capitol hill

george p shultz on friday attacked 
kissandtell books by former reagan administration officials as 
violating presidential trust and defended president reagan as being 
very much in charge of the country 
the us secretary of state also implied that such books affront 
common human decency as well 
without identifying the books he had in mind shultz called them 
a disservice and said he found the disclosures very 
disappointing 
donald regan former treasury secretary and later chief of staff 
for reagan has the latest book out about his years in the white 
house one of his most sensational disclosures was that first lady 
nancy reagan and also the president consulted an astrologer 
regan also portrayed the president as a passive chief executive 
who did not question him about economic policy while regan was 
treasury secretary 
in an earlier book former white house spokesman larry speakes 
revealed that he attributed to reagan quotes which speakes himself 
fashioned 
shultz was in brussels to brief north atlantic alliance 
ministers on his talks with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
he told a news conference books that are written especially 
when an administration is in office that essentially are gossipy 
things particularly about the first family are very disappointing 
and distressing to me 
he said a person who accepts a position close to the presidency 
with access to intimate discussion should observe standards of 
common human decency and also preserve an atmosphere in which 
the president can talk freely to his aides 
he said that otherwise free discussion is inhibited 
in response to a reporters question the secretary praised the 
president and mrs reagan saying the administration had changed 
the presidential agenda for the better and mrs reagan had 
worked hard to combat drugs 
shultz said its hard for me to see how anybody who takes 
part in discussions with the president can come to any conclusion 
other than on these basic issues that are presidential in nature 
that the president is very much in charge he has his views he 
expresses them one of the reasons he is respected so much is that 
he sticks to his positions

reagan administration officials rejected an 
air force plan for a ussoviet mission that would involve 
astronauts and cosmonauts using a russian spacecraft to recover a 
device from a star wars satellite an industry magazine reported 
friday 
aviation week and space technology in an edition dated for 
monday said lt gen james a abrahamson director of the air 
forces strategic defense initiative organization proposed the 
joint mission as a way of demonstrating us willingness to share 
the sdi star wars technology 
the plan called for the launch in august or september of an sdi 
satellite that would carry a breadboxsized materials package 
attached to its hull 
the package would be recovered in a joint ussoviet mission 
that would involve flying an astronaut and an american manned 
manuevering unit with cosmonauts aboard a russian spacecraft the 
manned manuevering unit or mmu is a backpack with compressed gas 
jets that permits astronauts to fly around untethered in space 
aviation week said the soviet craft would be launched and then 
linked up with the soviet mir space station the astronaut or a 
cosmonaut then would fly from mir to the sdi satellite and recover 
the package 
aviation week did not name its source for the story 
air force lt col edwina palmer of the sdi office refused to 
confirm or deny the magazine story saying she couldnt comment on 
internal deliberations 
bill sheehan a spokesman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration said he also was unable to confirm or deny the 
story 
i have not been able to determine if that happened or not 
sheehan said 
aviation week said nasa officials including some astronauts at 
the johnson space center were opposed to the idea but the 
magazine said engineers at johnson and at a martin marietta plant 
did study the feasibility of adapting the manned manuevering unit 
so it would fit through the hatch of the mir space station 
brian welch a spokesman at the johnson space center declined 
comment

a federal jury friday began deciding 
whether carlos lehder rivas led efforts to flood the united states 
with colombian cocaine or was a simple businessman duped by 
american smugglers 
after seven months of trial the panel began deliberating 
shortly before noon on 11 charges against lehder and one against 
codefendant jack carlton reed the jury recessed five hours later 
and will return on saturday 
the jury which will be sequestered heard 22 weeks of testimony 
from 115 government witnesses and saw mountains of documents and 
carts of packaged cocaine the defense called no witnesses relying 
instead on closing arguments 
lehder reputed to be one of the leaders of colombias violent 
medellin cartel has been called the most important foreign drug 
smuggler to face trial in the united states a man who pioneered 
the idea of mass shipments of cocaine 
wrapping up his prosecution us attorney robert w merkle told 
the jury you either convict him of everything in this case of 
convict him of nothing in the case 
in his closing statement chief defense attorney edward r 
shohat argued that lehder was simply a businessman who wanted to 
develop the bahamian island of normans cay as a tourist resort but 
was victimized by a conspiring group of americans who told the jury 
a litany of lies 
shohat said that groups leader was ed ward a convicted drug 
smuggler who served served six years of a 20year sentence and is 
now in living under a new identity in the federal witness 
protection program 
he charged that ward a former jacksonville area salesman and 
insurance agent was given the break of a lifetime by agreeing 
to cooperate against lehder ward reduced a possible 215year plus 
life sentence and a 59 million fine to less than six years in 
prison shohat said 
if convicted lehder faces up to life plus 150 years in prison 
250000 in fines and forfeiture of his assets in the bahamas 
shohat also hammered away at what he said were inconsistencies 
in the testimony of other witnesses many of them smugglers who 
also got reduced sentences or immunity for their testimony 
these people planned to dump on mr lehder these people knew 
how to get an american express card to freedom he said 
lehder 38 was specifically charged with one count of 
conspiracy to import cocaine two counts of importation of cocaine 
and seven counts of possession of cocaine with intent to 
distribute upon conviction each count carries a penalty of up to 
15 years in prison and a 25000 fine 
he also was accused of engaging in a continuing criminal 
enterprise a charge that carries a sentence of 10 years to life 
reed faced only one charge of conspiracy and a maximum penalty 
of 15 years in prison and a 25000 fine 
the indictment said lehder and reed conspired to smuggle some 
33 tons of cocaine into the united states from colombia via 
normans cay from 1978 to 1980 actual testimony however alleged 
that nearly 20 tons was smuggled by lehders organization earning 
him about 20 million 
lehder the son of a german father and colombian mother grew up 
on the streets of new york he was sentenced to federal prison in 
1974 on a charge of auto theft and marijuana possession 
he was deported to colombia in 1975 
lehder was indicted in 1981 but remained at large until feb 4 
1987 when he was arrested by colombian officials at a ranch near 
medellin colombia following a brief gunfight he was immediately 
put on a plane and brought to the united states 
reed known as smilin jack was arrested two days later in 
a jungle hut on the east coast of panama

a prominent scholar said friday the growth of 
the centralized national state in the 20th century threatens the 
united states with the same death suffered by ancient empires of 
the past 
robert nisbet retired humanities professor at columbia 
university and resident scholar at the american enterprise 
institute a conservative washington think tank praised villages 
families churches lodges and other forms of local communities as 
the best defense against excessive centralization of power 
it is in these intermediate groups and associations that the 
truest forms of community will be found nisbet said in a speech 
text distributed to reporters in advance they must be preserved 
strengthened honored 
nisbet a widely published historian and sociologist delivered 
the 17th annual jefferson lecture the highest honor conferred by 
the federal government for outstanding achievement in the 
humanities 
sponsored by the national endowment for the humanities an 
independent federal agency that underwrites research scholarship 
and education in the humanities the lecturer receives a stipend of 
10000 
the danger of large centralized bureaucracies is simply what 
we already see what is already obvious the suffocation or 
strangling of genuine thought of genuine leadership of genuine 
consensus nisbet said 
the lecturer saw hope in americans dislike for the massive 
circuitous mazelike federal bureaucracy and what he called a 
growing preference for localism with reliance on the family 
cities and states organized neighborhoods and volunteer 
associations 
if those true forms of community are not nourished he said 
if we continue to worship the national state and the national 
community we risk exposure to the fatal diseases of empires in 
history apoplexy at the center and anemia at the extremities

iraqi aircraft fired exocet missiles at 
an iranian cargo ship in the persian gulf and later damaged a 
tugboat towing the stricken vessel a londonbased maritime agency 
said friday 
the attack on the cargo ship injured 11 crewmen one seriously 
said lloyds shipping intelligence unit 
iraq reported another attack by its warplanes on a large naval 
target off the iranian coast on thursday afternoon its ninth 
such claim in the past two weeks the latest claim appeared to 
coincide with the attack on the tug the sea sapphire 
however a gulfbased shipping source said he had received 
information that the iranian cargo vessel the iran nahad 
exploded during an attack about 120 am thursday and may have 
been carrying arms 
the source who has shipping connections in the area but spoke 
on condition he not be identified also quoted his informant as 
saying the tugboat was searching for survivors of the blast but 
was not itself attacked 
there was no way immediately to reconcile the conflicting 
reports iran does not divulge details of iraqi raids on its 
coastal waters 
lloyds said that in the first attack at 1 am iraqi exocet 
missiles hit the 16580ton iran nahad setting a fire that gutted 
the crew quarters 
thirteen hours later as the ship was being towed to lavan 
island an oil terminal along irans central gulf coast lloyds 
said it was attacked for a second time 
it did not indicate whether the iran nahad was hit again but 
said the liberianowned and panamanianflagged sea sapphire which 
was towing the vessel sustained damage to the wheelhouse and 
would go to a united arab emirates shipyard for repair 
iraq locked in a 7yearold war with iran attacks iranian 
tankers iran retaliates with attacks on neutral shipping its last 
such attack was on a saudi arabian tanker on april 24

sailed through the suez canal en route to the arabian sea where 
it will operate in support of the us escort operations in the 
gulf 
the 60000ton forrestal becomes the fifth us aircraft carrier

a city council member who touched off a 
dispute by proclaiming himself council president after the death of 
mayor richard s caliguiri had no right to do so the citys legal 
adviser said friday 
councilman ben woods who on thursday had declared that i can 
do what i want because he was the rightful acting council 
president said friday that he would abide by the ruling of city 
solicitor dan pellegrini saying that it wasnt so 
some members of city council are obviously jockeying for 
position pellegrini said they believe they can get some 
advantage out of it 
caliguiri a popular politician who had been mayor since 1977 
died may 6 at age 56 of a rare incurable illness the city council 
president sophie masloff was sworn in as the mayors successor 
and woods argued that as council president pro tem he should 
automatically take mrs masloffs job 
pellegrini said friday that mrs masloff would retain the 
council president title but will not exercise those powers which 
include appointing committee heads and hiring council employees 
the city council will decide next week who will exercise those 
powers instead pellegrini said woods said he expected the eight 
members of council not including mrs masloff would vote monday 
to hand the reins to him 
ill live with it pellegrinis ruling woods said friday 
i dont agree with it hes the city solicitor im not going 
to challenge it in court 
woods began exercising the powers of president the day caliguiri 
died among other things he rescinded the 100 fine finance 
committee chairman mark pollock had levied against councilman jim 
ferlo and the 60 fine against councilman jack wagner pollock 
accused his two political adversaries of disrupting a committee 
meeting 
most concerned citizens were thinking of the mayor and his 
family pollock said ben was thinking about rescinding fines 
and taking power which tells a great deal 
another critic on the city council michelle madoff accused 
woods of causing a circus 
here we are not even a few days after the burial and bens 
coming in and dividing us saying im in charge im running this 
place he hasnt even waited for a legal opinion she said 
thursday 
the city charter is vague on the succession issue woods cited 
precedent for his position pellegrini cited precedent and prior 
solicitors opinions for his legal opinion 
both council president and president pro tem are elected by the 
city council pro tem is short for the latin phrase pro 
tempore which means temporary or temporarily

a 7yearold boy who has recovered from 
serious automobile accident injuries missed out on a white house 
meeting with president reagan on friday because of a mix up in time 
but presidential aides will arrange for a makeup visit soon for 
young chris dunning and his family of alexandria va deputy press 
secretary bj cooper said 
reagan showed up 12 minutes late for a safe kids program in 
the rose garden and explained it was because we were waiting for 
one very special person who apparently is not going to be able to 
get here 
safe kids is an organization backed by the national safety 
council and childrens hospital here to conduct a national campaign 
to fight preventable injuries to children 
the dunning boy was hit by a car while playing near his home in 
august 1985 
suffering serious neck and leg injuries christopher could 
easily have been paralyzed had any of the people who treated him 
made the slightest mistake reagan told the group but 
fortunately the paramedics had completed a pediatric trauma 
course and today he is fully healed 
about the time the president was saying these words chriss 
father james dunning was telephoning childrens hospital to 
confirm the time that the family was supposed to be there for the 
trip to the white house 
he was told that the event already was going on 
cooper said the program originally planned for 145 pm had 
been changed to 1145 am and the dunnings hadnt been told 
although other families who were to be present were notified 
kim haddow a spokeswoman for safe kids confirmed that that 
is what happened 
so instead of going to the white house young chris went off to 
the beach with friends his father said 
i dont think he actually realized what a big deal it was 
said haddow 
he said the white house already had called to say that the 
family would be getting an invitation to call on the president soon

an embattled cabinet minister who said japan was 
not at fault for world war ii resigned friday after complaints at 
home and abroad hurt prime minister noboru takeshitas 
administration 
seisuke okuno chief of the national land agency handed in his 
resignation late friday afternoon said officials in the governing 
liberal democratic party 
former construction minister hideo utsumi 66 was named his 
successor utsumi told reporters japan should try to promote good 
relations with china kyodo news service reported 
the affair comes four months before a scheduled visit by 
takeshita to china late this summer 
foreign ministry spokesman yoshifumi matsuda acknowledged 
thursday that okunos statements give very serious damage to our 
hearttoheart relations between the two peoples 
foreign minister sosuke uno who tried to soothe chinas 
irritation during a visit to beijing last week said only we 
would like to try harder to promote friendly ties with neighboring 
countries 
the 75yearold okuno who headed the justice and education 
ministries under previous administrations was widely regarded as 
the no 3 man in the government after takeshita and finance 
minister kiichi miyazawa 
at a news conference okuno said he stepped down not because i 
erred but because his remarks had disrupted parliamentary 
business 
the announcement came three weeks after okuno claimed japan was 
not an aggressor in world war ii and had fought to protect itself 
at a time when the white race had turned asia into a colony 
china south korea and north korea condemned the statements in 
japan opposition political parties united in calling for his 
resignation the largest opposition groups the japan socialist 
party and the komeito clean government party were prepared to 
submit a noconfidence resolution in parliament a komeito official 
said 
news reports friday said takeshita who avoided disputing 
okunos remarks or taking action against him wanted him to step 
down voluntarily kyodo reported that he put the request to okuno 
in a meeting friday morning 
opposition leaders hailed fridays outcome as appropriate 
okunos remarks violated the spirit of the sinojapanese 
peace and friendship treaty so his resignation is proper said 
yuichi ichikawa parliamentary policy head of the komeito it was 
long overdue 
okuno was the third politician in takeshitas sixmonthold 
government to resign amid controversy 
in february koichi hamada chairman of the lower house budget 
committee resigned after a fiveday parliamentary stalemate 
following an outburst in which he called an opposition legislator a 
murderer 
in november days after takeshita became prime minister lower 
house justice committee chairman hideyuki aizawa stepped down after 
he was charged with evading taxes both were ranking officials in 
takeshitas liberal democratic party 
china and japan waged an eightyear war beginning in 1937 that 
killed an estimated 571000 japanese and 13 million chinese 
soldiers and an untold number of civilians 
the two countries signed a treaty in 1972 that says in part 
the japanese side is keenly aware of japans responsibility for 
causing enormous damages in the past to the chinese people through 
war and deeply reproaches itself 
it was the hawkish okunos third major brush with controversy in 
his political career as kakuei tanakas education minister he 
faced a noconfidence motion in the early 1970s after he called the 
japan teachers union a dissident group 
as justice minister a decade later under prime minister zenko 
suzuki he was criticized for urging revision of the constitution 
which renounces the use of war

a judge friday ordered the former 
administrator of drake memorial hospital to spend 30 days in jail 
for falsifying the personnel file of donald harvey the former 
nurses aide who has admitted killing 48 people 
former administrator jan taylor was sentenced after he pleaded 
no contest to falsifying a public document a misdemeanor offense 
taylor was indicted last year on four felony charges of tampering 
with evidence for adding information to harveys file but he 
pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor count as part of a bargain 
with prosecutors 
families of harveys victims were unhappy that taylor 50 was 
able to avoid a trial that could have developed information for use 
in their civil suits stemming from the killings 
harvey 35 is serving three consecutive life terms in the state 
prison at lucasville after pleading guilty to killing 21 patients 
when he worked as a nurses aide at drake a hospital for longterm 
care from 1983 to 1987 
harvey used arsenic and cyanide to poison most of his victims 
often putting it in the hospital food he served them authorities 
said 
harvey also is serving a simultaneous life sentence for 
admitting killing nine people at marymount hospital in london ky 
while he worked there in 197071 the fbi is looking into harveys 
claims that he also killed 18 people while working at the veterans 
administration medical center in cincinnati before he was hired at 
drake 
taylor was accused of putting in the personnel file that 
harveys references had been checked out with previous employers 
defense attorney r scott croswell said the information was added 
because taylor believed it was his duty to update the file and make 
it complete 
taylor who did not hire harvey has said that after the 
investigation of harvey had begun he noticed the information about 
references was lacking and had another drake employee check the 
references and add them to the file 
precisely what the hospital had done to check harvey before he 
was hired is a matter of dispute in civil suits by victims 
relatives 
hamilton county common pleas judge robert gorman gave taylor the 
maximum sentence of 180 days in jail then suspended all but 30 
days he declined to fine taylor who could have received up to a 
1000 fine 
gorman said he was giving taylor a jail sentence because he was 
a public figure held to a higher standard than private citizens in 
such matters 
this sentence is offered as a deterrent more than a 
punishment and its a message to others who hold similar office 
gorman said 
taylor declined to talk to reporters as he left the courtroom 
gorman said he can remain free for 30 days while he decides whether 
to appeal the sentence 
relatives of some of harveys victims who sat in the courtroom 
friday said taylor and other drake officials should have stood 
trial for their handling of the harvey case 
i dont really quarrel with the judge as much as i quarrel 
with the prosecutors office said michael pike whose father 
joseph 68 was killed by an injection of cleaning fluid last year 
its a slap in the face to everyone murdered out there pike 
said its a slap in the face to the families 
the victims families had fought the prosecutors office to try 
to get information obtained in the criminal investigation of 
harvey the nocontest plea that resulted in the sentencing friday 
cannot be used against taylor in the civil suits

a federal judge ruled friday that a securities 
and exchange commission attorney was sexually harassed by her 
bosses and got a bad evaluation and a transfer for complaining 
about the hostile work environment 
us district judge john h pratt upheld catherine a 
brodericks complaints that she was harassed by managers of the 
agencys washington regional office and denied promotions when she 
complained about the units sexually hostile environment 
pratt held that the sec had violated the section of the civil 
rights act of 1964 that forbids sex discrimination and he scheduled 
a may 26 hearing to determine what sanctions to impose on the 
agency 
plaintiff without any doubt was forced to work in an 
environment in which the wro washington regional office managers 
by their conduct harassed her and other wro female employees by 
bestowing preferential treatment upon those who submitted to their 
sexual advances pratt said 
the record is clear that plaintiff and other women working at 
the wro found the sexual conduct and its accompanying 
manifestations which wro managers engaged in over a protracted 
period of time to be offensive pratt said 
pratt ruled that ms broderick 35 received a negative 
evaluation and was transferred to another division after 
complaining that male supervisors had sexual relationships with 
women employees this socializing included onthejob drinking and 
long lunch hours 
the judge also found that former sec commissioner john shad now 
ambassador to the netherlands and the agencys executive director 
george kundahl were aware of ms brodericks complaints in early 
1984 when she filed a memo outlining her allegations 
the agency which conducted its own internal investigation 
ruled against ms broderick in 1986 
s beville may ms brodericks attorney called the ruling an 
absolute unparalleled victory 
ms may said the ruling means that broderick who works in the 
corporation finances section will be entitled to back pay and 
promotions denied as a result of sex discrimination 
sec spokesman mary mccue said the agency did not have any 
comment on pratts ruling 
pratt found that within a week of joining the sec staff in 1979 
ms broderick spurned repeated offers of a ride home from staff 
counsel john hunter 
at a farewell party for a coworker in 1982 ms broderick was 
kissed by the regional administrator paul f leonard after he 
came up to her and untied her sweater 
the judge also accepted brodericks testimony that leonard and 
trial counsel jack kiefner made suggestive remarks about her dress 
and figure 
but it was the occurrence of numerous other incidents of which 
plaintiff early on became aware which for her created a sexually 
hostile or offensive working environment pratt ruled 
this in turn poisoned the possibility of plaintiffs having 
the proper professional respect for her superiors and without any 
question affected her motivation and her performance of her job 
responsibilities pratt ruled 
the washington regional office closed and many of the sec 
officials named in ms brodericks complaint were transferred to 
the newly created philadelphia regional office 
pratt discounted the testimony of leonard now retired and 
cliff kennedy the agencys philadelphia regional administrator and 
hunter as deserving little credence 
the judge found that the testimony of herbert f brooks jr now 
assistant regional administrator in philadelphia was in material 
respects false and incredible 
the judge ruled there is compelling evidence that brooks had a 
sexual relationship with a secretary who received two promotions 
and a 300 cash award and a perfect evaluation 
pratt also found that a woman staff attorney received several 
promotions during a time she socialized on the job with kennedy 
pratt also found that hunter had an affair with a secretary who 
received three promotions a commendation and two cash awards 
despite hunters admissions that he contributed to the 
secretarys evaluations pratt found he was never disciplined for 
this conduct but instead received 10 salary increases between 
october 1983 and january 1987

jewelers say its plain old tarnish 
but at least 18 roman catholics say its a miracle they report 
that their rosaries have changed from silver to gold or copper 
the believers dismiss the scientific explanation of the 
phenomenon instead crediting the virgin mary for the yellowish 
color of their formerly silver rosaries 
it was like mary came to me said lila somers of novato 
clutching her rosary in a churchs bible study room where she went 
this week to hear other tales of rosary miracles 
the rosary was in my hand and it was glowing she said 
somers and 17 others have reported the color change since a 
retreat in burlingame last month that focused on mary about 50 
members of the mother of god queen of peace prayer community of the 
carmelite monastery in marinwood encompassing two prayer groups 
attended 
they say the experience has changed their lives and encouraged 
them to pursue their faith in a deeper way 
chills went through my whole body said mary senour of 
petaluma who said she saw her rosary turn from silver to gold as 
she drove home from the retreat 15 miles south of san francisco 
i just felt humbled like god was really blessing us 
jewelers say the erosion or tarnishing of the silveer coating is 
influenced by body moisture and environmental factors such as 
humidity and climate 
the one that we inspected is made out of brass and white base 
metal and under certain conditions base metals will oxidize and 
corrode said evan hacker a mill valley jeweler who examined one 
of the rosaries its an oxidation process better known as 
tarnishing 
miraculous changes in the prayer beads have been reported in 
other parts of the world 
in portsmouth ri at least 50 parishioners reported their 
rosaries had changed from silver to gold after a man returned last 
june from a pilgrimage to medjugorje yugoslavia children in that 
community claimed to have seen the virgin mary many times 
mary ann serrano a san rafael evangelist has visited 
medjugorje and said there are numerous other associated phenomena 
including a crackling fireball and the sun spinning across the sky 
maybe were a little too enthusiastic she said of the local 
incident but its real its the realest of the real 
the rev john mcgregor a parttime chaplain for the carmelite 
sisters also dismisses the scientific explanation 
i dont really think its a chemical reaction from their 
sweaty hands he said i think the phenomenon is much like 
moses and the burning bush it calls peoples attention to prayer

the leaders of a new political group formed to 
challenge the communist party unveiled their platform friday and 
said they planned to try to register with authorities but expected 
to be rebuffed 
at a crowded eighthfloor apartment in northwest moscow 
organizers of the democratic union gathered to discuss their plans 
for political action at least a dozen uniformed policemen milled 
around the building entrance but made no attempt to stop those 
entering or leaving 
the declaration of goals and principles followed a week of 
meetings in which the organizers said more than 150 soviets from 27 
cities took part in deciding political stands for the party formed 
on may 7 
yuri denisov one of the partys 15 central coordinating council 
members said the democratic union would try to comply with laws 
requiring groups to register their activity 
we will soon make an attempt to register our party he told 
journalists but of course we expect problems with that and we do 
not expect to succeed 
another of the coordinating council members alexander lukashev 
outlined broad party policies summing up the new groups goal as 
presenting an opposition to the current communist party 
monopoly on power and political thought 
the group opposes the soviet occupation of the baltic states 
of lithuania latvia and estonia and soviet actions in eastern 
europe that have helped keep communist government in power there 
he said 
the party has called for independent trade unions and on friday 
issued a statement denouncing polish officials actions to halt 
industrial strikes in the sovietallied country 
the democratic union comes out in opposition to

the attorney for a woman convicted in the 
nations first deathbyproducttampering trial said friday that he 
will ask for a mistrial in the case 
federal public defender thomas hillier gave notice of his intent 
to ask for a mistrial as jurors in the stella nickell case were 
ordered back to court to answer questions about whether they were 
improperly influenced in reaching a verdict the formal motion for 
a mistrial is expected to be filed next week 
hillier did not elaborate on his reasons for seeking a mistrial 
except to say that there was no way to know how the jurys 
deliberations were affected by a juror who was privy to information 
that was not presented to jurors during the trial 
suspicion over juror impartiality had increased since the 
verdict monday 
questions were raised when juror laurel holliday said an 
anonymous phone caller had told her that mrs nickell had failed a 
liedetector test and later when it was revealed that ms holliday 
had filed a lawsuit of her own last year alleging that a product 
had been contaminated 
under questioning by us district judge william dwyer however 
ms holliday denied she had been improperly influenced in any way 
in reaching her verdict 
the jury took five days to convict mrs nickell 44 of auburn 
of contaminating overthecounter medicine capsules with cyanide 
they included two counts of spiking the capsules that killed her 
husband bruce nickell 52 and a stranger susan katherine snow 
40 of auburn in june 1986 
she faces possible life imprisonment at a june 17 sentencing 
prosecutors said she killed her husband to collect 176000 in life 
insurance benefits 
her trial was the first under federal antitampering statutes 
enacted after seven people died in chicago in 1982 from 
cyanidelaced tylenol no one was ever charged in that case 
ms holliday had said she received the anonymous phone call may 
6 when jurors were still deadlocked 111 in favor of convicting 
mrs nickell ms holliday was the lone holdout 
ms holliday told dwyer on friday however that she had 
dismissed the information about the liedetector test from her mind 
during deliberation and judged the case on the facts 
she also said she did not mention her own lawsuit when she was 
questioned during jury selection because she did not think it was 
relevant 
after listening to ms hollidays testimony friday hillier said 
it raised very serious and troubling questions on her ability to 
sit on this jury 
the other 11 jurors were also questioned all of them said they 
had been unaware during the deliberations of the phone call to ms 
holliday or the liedetector test and had no idea who could have 
placed the call 
potential jurors had been asked whether they had ever been party 
to a producttampering case but ms holliday said she considered 
her case one involving a manufacturing error 
ms holliday had sued pepperidge farm inc in 1987 after she 
allegedly bit into a cracker in 1986 that contained an 
aspirinsubstitute pill the matter was settled out of court for 
500 less than two months prior to ms hollidays selection for 
mrs nickells jury 
i still dont see how that relates to stella nickell and how i 
would determine guilt or innocence ms holliday said

republican george bush labeled michael 
dukakis naive on defense friday equating him with 1972 nominee 
george mcgovern and saying even jimmy carter and walter mondale 
supported military systems dukakis opposes 
the dukakis doctrine is the doctrine of wishful thinking and 
it is bad thinking the vice president told a crowd of defense 
plant workers here the sovietsrespect only strength to think 
that they would agree to cuts in their strategic and conventional 
arsenals in the face of unilateral american abandonment of major 
weapons programs is the height of folly 
bush portrayed dukakis his likely democratic opponent in the 
fall election as more extreme than former president carter and 
1984 democratic nominee walter mondale 
the governors views are naive at best and if implemented 
would be dangerous to the defense of this country bush said 
it is the thinking of george mcgovern not harry truman even 
jimmy carter and walter mondale supported systems that governor 
dukakis opposes 
at a rally later in escondido calif bush said the 1988 choice 
will be crystal clear 
it will be like the mcgovern race in 1972 he told a 
republican rally its that clear 
the hughes aircraft plant where air traffic control systems and 
military radars are made was the second defense plant in as many 
days for the gop nomineetobe he emphasized his defense policies 
anew at a san diego air show on friday before flying to portland 
ore in advance of the tuesday primary there 
standing in the brilliant sunshine before several thousand 
hughes employees bush tossed out almost a third of his prepared 
speech to wind up with a ferverent patriotic appeal 
if i am elected your presidenti will never ever apologize 
for the united states of america i will help keep her strong 
bush declared i will protect our vital freedoms i will help 
those around the world who are struggling for freedom and democracy 
never take for granted the blessings that we have in this the 
greatest country on the face of the earth 
as in previous speeches bush criticized the democrats for 
opposition to various reagan defense programs this time aiming the 
accusation directly at the massachusetts governor 
gov dukakis and jesse jackson as well opposes virtually 
every step we are taking to keep our defenses at the technological 
edge bush said adding dukakis name to a charge he initiated 
thursday dukakis opposes the mx he opposes the midgetman he 
opposes testing of nuclear weapons he opposes flighttesting of 
ballistic missiles he opposes testing of antisatellite weapons 
he opposes the building of a strategic defense 
dukakis aides were quick to respond 
what bush is trying to do is use 1970s arguments to face the 
challenges of the 1990s said madeleine albright a dukakis 
foreign policy adviser 
its perfectly understandable that bush is trying to shift 
attention away from noriega said chris edley dukakis top 
issues adviser in a reference to stories about panamanian gen 
manuel noriega 
bush told reporters when asked about a proposal to drop drug 
trafficking charges against noriega if he leaves panama i said i 
would not comment on it im not willing to answer 
hypotheticals but bush went on to say i want to see change i 
want to see him brought to justice 
bush aides denied that the vice president was implying criticism 
of any deal with noriega that would involve dropping the indictment 
mcgovern proposed a 20 percent cut in defense spending when he 
was the nominee in 1972 dukakis has not proposed any such 
acrosstheboard cuts in defense targeting specific programs for 
reduction and some for increases 
bush also pushed another theme that he plans to use in the fall 
election linking defense spending to the jobs it creates in this 
country 
some are saying that the government should look elsewhere to 
serve the needs of our people bush said they ignore the 
importance of defense research to science and technology 
manufacturing and tradeand contributing to our prosperity 
undermining americas aerospace and defense industry will come 
back to haunt us not just in terms of our national security but 
in terms of our economic security he added the labor force of 
tomorrow depends on the technology that we produce today

a judge said friday that he will grant 
r gene simmons wish to set a quick execution date if he is 
convinced that simmons is mentally competent to waive his appeal of 
the death sentence 
simmons 47 was convicted thursday of killing a man and a woman 
during a 45minute rampage dec 28 in russellville after he 
surrendered police found the bodies of 14 relatives on his 
property at nearby dover 
he is scheduled to stand trial july 18 on those slayings but 
circuit judge john s patterson said he would hold a hearing monday 
on simmons competence and would set an execution date of before 
july 18 if he concluded simmons was not mentally incompetent 
after he was convicted and the jury set a death sentence 
thursday simmons surprised the court by reading a statement 
emphatically requesting a quick execution date 
i want no action that will delay deny defer or denounce this 
very correct and proper death sentence simmons said in a calm 
voice 
simmons said that in his case anything short of death would 
be cruel and unusual punishment i only ask for what i deserve 
let the torture and suffering in me end 
simmons lawyers said they had tried to talk him out of making 
the request but had eventually concluded that they had to accede to 
his wishes 
patterson who presided over simmons fourday trial refused to 
be specific about a sentencing date except to say it would be 
before july 18 state law says the execution date must be at least 
30 days after a judgment is entered in a case which in the simmons 
case is expected to take place monday 
the last execution in arkansas was in 1964 
john bynum who prosecuted simmons said friday that there is no 
automatic or mandatory appeal of a death sentence in arkansas and 
that the state would resist any outside groups attempt to block 
the execution despite simmons stated wishes 
under arkansas law he said a person can waive his right to 
appeal he said it would be his position based on a hearing 
conducted thursday after the sentence was handed down that mr 
simmons has knowingly and intelligently waived his right to 
appeal 
my position is that if he demands an immediate execution he 
should be executed bynum said 
simmons was found guilty of capital murder five counts of 
attempted capital murder and firstdegree false imprisonment from 
the dec 28 spree the jury deliberated less than 1 hours before 
finding him guilty and an additonal two hours before recommending 
the death penalty 
patterson following the recommendation sentenced simmons to 
die by lethal injection and to 147 years in prison on the other 
charges 
the bodies found at the simmons home included his wife four 
daughters three sons two spouses of children three grandchildren 
and a child officials said simmons fathered by his oldest daughter 
all had been shot or strangled 
miss kendrick 24 shot at the law office where she worked 
reportedly had spurned simmons advances a year before the 
shooting chaffin 33 shot at an oil company was described as a 
chance victim 
were satisfied hes sane and competent said robert e 
irwin one of simmons attorneys what would you say to people 
who contend that you have an obligation to save his life no matter 
what 
the death penalty is here its the law of the land mr 
simmons believes what he did warrants the death penalty he is a 
supporter of that penalty 
harris said simmons didnt plead guilty because he felt like his 
best chance of getting the death penalty was to mount a defense 
lew neal a psychiatrist who examined simmons said simmons told 
him that he would have killed himself dec 28 if one of his guns 
hadnt malfunctioned

a judge friday ordered the former 
administrator of drake memorial hospital to spend 30 days in jail 
for falsifying the personnel file of donald harvey the former 
nurses aide who has admitted killing 48 people 
former administrator jan taylor was sentenced after he pleaded 
no contest to falsifying a public document a misdemeanor offense 
taylor was indicted last year on four felony charges of tampering 
with evidence for adding information to harveys file but he 
pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor count as part of a bargain 
with prosecutors 
families of harveys victims were unhappy that taylor 50 was 
able to avoid a trial that could have developed information for use 
in their civil suits stemming from the killings 
harvey 35 is serving three consecutive life terms in the state 
prison at lucasville after pleading guilty to killing 21 patients 
when he worked as a nurses aide at drake a hospital for longterm 
care from 1983 to 1987 
harvey used arsenic and cyanide to poison most of his victims 
often putting it in the hospital food he served them authorities 
said 
harvey also is serving a simultaneous life sentence for 
admitting killing nine people at marymount hospital in london ky 
while he worked there in 197071 the fbi is looking into harveys 
claims that he also killed 18 people while working at the veterans 
administration medical center in cincinnati before he was hired at 
drake 
taylor was accused of putting in the personnel file that 
harveys references had been checked out with previous employers 
defense attorney r scott croswell said the information was added 
because taylor believed it was his duty to update the file and make 
it complete 
taylor who did not hire harvey has said that after the 
investigation of harvey had begun he noticed the information about 
references was lacking and had another drake employee check the 
references and add them to the file 
precisely what the hospital had done to check harvey before he 
was hired is a matter of dispute in civil suits by victims 
relatives 
hamilton county common pleas judge robert gorman gave taylor the 
maximum sentence of 180 days in jail then suspended all but 30 
days he declined to fine taylor who could have received up to a 
1000 fine 
gorman said he was giving taylor a jail sentence because he was 
a public figure held to a higher standard than private citizens in 
such matters 
this sentence is offered as a deterrent more than a 
punishment and its a message to others who hold similar office 
gorman said 
taylor declined to talk to reporters as he left the courtroom 
gorman said he can remain free for 30 days while he decides whether 
to appeal the sentence 
relatives of some of harveys victims who sat in the courtroom 
friday said taylor and other drake officials should have stood 
trial for their handling of the harvey case 
i dont really quarrel with the judge as much as i quarrel 
with the prosecutors office said michael pike whose father 
joseph 68 was killed by an injection of cleaning fluid last year 
its a slap in the face to everyone murdered out there pike 
said its a slap in the face to the families 
the victims families had fought the prosecutors office to try 
to get information obtained in the criminal investigation of 
harvey the nocontest plea that resulted in the sentencing friday 
cannot be used against taylor in the civil suits

tens of thousands of pilgrims prayed at 
the roman catholic shrine of fatima on friday to mark the 71st 
anniversary of the reported appearence of the virgin mary to three 
shepherd children 
pilgrims walked tens sometimes hundreds of miles to the shrine 
in central portugal to fulfill vows made in thanksgiving for the 
recovery of a sick relative or in faith of a cure many approached 
the basilica on their knees 
portuguese newspapers quoted church sources as saying pope john 
paul ii may make a brief visit to the sanctuary in august to 
beatify two of the shepherds who died in their childhood 
beatification is a step toward sainthood 
the pope visited fatima in 1982 to give thanks for his recovery 
from bullet wounds inflicted by turkish assailant mehmet ali agca 
in romes st peter square exactly one year before 
a rebel spanish priest tried to stab the pontiff at fatima he 
was overpowered by security guards and was sentenced to six years 
and six months in jail then expelled from the country 
the shrine is built near the site of a holmoak tree where the 
three children then aged 10 nine and seven said they saw mary 
appear in visions several times between may 13 and oct 13 1917 
lucia the eldest of the children and the only one still alive 
said mary gave them a message part of which the vatican has kept 
secret ever since 
another part of the message was said to be a description of the 
coming horrors of world war ii

adventurism or prevent any attempt at the takeover by the 
communists he said 
there is nothing that madame aquino should fear from me he 
said i mean well and if i should be any obstacle we will be 
able to work it out

democratic presidential frontrunner 
michael dukakis on friday dismissed jesse jacksons accusation that 
he is too vague pointing to his record as governor and saying that 
jacksons comparison of him with george bush will come as a 
surprise to the white house 
hitting back at jackson on another topic dukakis suggested his 
democratic rivals call for a big spending increase for education 
doesnt make any sense in the face of federal budget deficits 
the massachusetts governor also spoke to students at a high 
school in this san francisco suburb warning against illegal drugs 
and calling for increased public emphasis on education 
his wife kitty told students of her own 26year dependency on 
diet pills 
as he began his california campaign dukakis came under fresh 
attack from jackson who is making a last stand in that states 
june 7 primary 
jackson called dukakis antidrug programs a farce rejected 
his education proposals as inadequate and said like bush 
dukakis almost brags about putting forth no plans 
dukakis responded it will come as a surprise to the white 
house and mr bush if my views on the world and my style of 
political leadership has any similarity to his one of the things i 
have is a record people dont have to guess about it 
he spoke favorably of a massachusetts drug abuse education and 
prevention program that he contended had reduced drug abuse among 
students 
speaking to about 200 students at jefferson high school in daly 
city dukakis called for more pay for teachers and said that 
means weve got to tax ourselves 
he later said he was not advocating a federal tax increase for 
education he said that states and local governments were putting 
more tax money into education and that teachers should be a 
priority 
at the same time he responded negatively to jacksons call for 
greatly increasing the federal education budget 
you cant go around talking about 20 billion more for public 
education out of the federal budget when youve got a 170 billion 
deficit that doesnt make any sense he said youve got to 
pick your priorities and pick them carefully 
with a seemingly insurmountable lead in delegates dukakis began 
campaigning in california the state with the biggest delegate 
prize a week after jackson entered the state 
the massachusetts governor stopped briefly in portland ore 
and was campaigning across california friday and saturday with one 
more stop in oregon where he faces jackson in a primary tuesday 
he was endorsed by california state controller gray davis who 
praised his commitment to protect the coastline against oil 
drilling 
dukakis turned aside questions about a running mate saying he 
would not focus on that until after the california primary 
when asked if he could choose someone who had supported aid to 
the nicaraguan contras aid that dukakis opposes the governor 
said no single issue would be a disqualification 
im not going to be looking for a clone of mike dukakis he 
said 
dukakis later called for a renewed commitment to education in a 
speech to students at california state universitylong beach 
he offered a few details on his plan for a 250 million national 
teaching excellence fund including spending to forgive college 
loans if students become teachers and a network of retired 
teachers providing specialized classroom instruction in math and 
science 
we all know that the next president will inherit an ocean of 
republican red ink dukakis said he and the congress will have 
to make hard choices on spending and for me the highest 
priority is teaching 
for a second day dukakis jabbed at reagan over disclosures the 
presidents wife consulted an astrologist in determining his 
schedule dukakis said he had checked the horoscope for himself and 
attorney general edwin meese iii and in both cases it said we 
were going to be changing our positions

gen manuel antonio noriega said 
friday that talks with the united states about his departure from 
power have collapsed 
at ceremonies in this rural town marking the anniversary of the 
death of a revolutionary hero noriega also told the associated 
press he could run for president in elections next year 
everything fell apart everything fell apart everthing 
apart noriega repeated when asked about the talks between panama 
and the reagan administration to try to resolve the panamanian 
crisis 
noriega is chief of panamas defense forces and the power behind 
the civilian government he was charged in miami in february with 
taking at least 46 million in payoffs from colombias medellin 
cartel to protect cocaine shipments launder money supply drug 
laboratories and shelter the gangs leaders from law enforcement 
reagan administration officials had said they were discussing 
with noriega the possibility of dropping the drug charges if 
noriega relinquished power 
when asked in washington about noriegas remarks white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater replied he says that all the time he 
said fall apart or something similar before we are still 
talking we are still negotiating 
attorney general edwin meese iii on friday presented reagan with 
arguments against dismissing drug charges against noriega 
according to us attorney leon kellner of miami who obtained one 
of the indictments 
kellner told reporters he met meese twice this week to argue 
against such a move and that meese told him he also opposed 
dismissal and would convey my thoughts to the president 
he told me he did that today kellner added 
kellner said it would send the wrong message to americans 
because the government is cracking down on drug traffickers and 
users 
how do we continue going after the little fish when the 
big fish can walk away kellner asked 
us customs service chief william von raab whose agencys 
investigative efforts contributed to the drug indictments against 
noriega also said on friday that noriega should be prosecuted 
noriega visited la negrita 90 miles from panama city where 
victoriano lorenzo a populist revolutionary was executed by 
colombian authorities on may 15 1903 
although panama did not gain independence from colombia until 
six months later and although lorenzo was not fighting for 
independence he is considered a precursor and martyr of panamanian 
nationalism 
noriega did not address the crowd of several hundred peasants 
and other supporters from nearby towns instead he listened to 
three speeches by local authorities denouncing yankee 
aggression 
as he descended the platform noriega was asked if he could run 
for president in elections scheduled for next may 
legally yes he answered with a broad smile surrounded by 
an adulatory crowd 
asked if he was actively considering running for president 
noriega merely laughed 
on hand was a dignity battalion of about 100 men they had 
vintage rifles and were dressed in blue jeans tshirts printed 
with not one step backward and redandwhite baseball caps 
saying i dont sell out my country 
several such battalions have been formed in recent weeks as the 
uspanamanian crisis deepened and authorities warned of the 
danger of a us invasion 
here there the yankees will die chanted the crowd 
against the aggression popular militias they also chanted 
accompanying noriega who was dressed in a camouflage combat 
uniform were acting chief executive manuel solis palma several 
cabinet ministers and more than a dozen military officers 
later friday during a meeting in rio hato 60 miles southwest 
of panama city noriega said of state department envoy michael 
kozak mr kozak is here i have not talked with mr kozak 
the dignity of panama is not negotiable while there are 
foreign troops on our territory humiliating our soil while there 
is economic aggression as long as there are threats as long as 
there is psychological war as long as us ambassador arthur 
davis does not get out 
he spoke with journalists during a meeting with representatives 
of local governments from around the country 
noriegas lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissal 
of the drug charges in about a month they contend the charges are 
politically motivated 
noriega and panamanian government officials contend there simply 
is nothing to negotiate with washington 
the united states still recognizes eric arturo delvalle now in 
hiding as panamas legitimate president noriega dismissed him 
feb 26 the day after delvalle tried to fire the general 
in new york panamanian opposition leader ivan romero who was 
expelled from his country may 6 told the associated press in an 
interview that he plans to return to panama on monday to continue 
his struggle against the government 
romero secretarygeneral of the christian democratic party 
said friday he was arrested beaten with a rock questioned and 
held overnight in prison may 6 before being forced onto a plane to 
miami

the senate voted overwhelmingly friday to 
order the us military to enter the war against illegal drug 
trafficking approving a plan to give the navy the power to stop 
drug boats on the high seas and make arrests 
the chamber voted 836 approval of an amendment outlining a 
wideranging antidrug plan for the military 
the proposal provides more surveillance by air force and navy 
planes a bigger antidrug role for the national guard and more 
pentagon helicopters for the coast guard and customs service 
the most controversial provision would require navy vessels to 
track suspected drug boats in international waters and would allow 
navy officers to arrest suspected drug traffickers the officers 
would be temporarily deputized by coast guard officers who 
would be aboard for that purpose 
the antidrug provision was the main unresolved issue as the 
senate worked toward approval of a bill authorizing defense 
spending for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
passage by the democraticcontrolled chamber will send the bill 
to a housesenate conference committee to reconcile differences 
between it and the separate pentagon bill approved wednesday by the 
house both measures authorize 2995 billion for the pentagon 
one major difference will be the antidrug provision the house 
measure orders president reagan to have the military 
substantially halt the flow of illegal drugs into the united 
states 
i think we have a chemical war being directed against the 
united states said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed 
services committee 
but he warned that the military help wont solve the problem 
let no one believe that were going to pass a piece of 
legislation and solve the drug problem but we can improve it 
i think we all know the drug epidemic in this country is far past 
the stage where interdiction came stop it 
other senators warned that drugs have become a national security 
menace but they also acknowledged that the military plan wont 
solve the problem 
the loudest critic was sen john glenn dohio who accused his 
colleagues of posturing on this 
we all get up posture make our little statements and it 
isnt going to make any difference said glenn arguing that the 
us lacks a coordinated or effective nationwide antidrug program 
its absolutely ludicrous to think this will solve the 
problem he said 
the pentagon has resisted a larger role in the war against 
drugs saying the military is not trained or equipped for the 
assignment 
the senate antidrug plan was hammered out in three days of 
meetings by senators who put together parts of two competing 
proposals also involved in the talks were defense secretary frank 
carlucci and attorney general edwin meese iii 
sen dennis deconcini dariz said we have reached a point 
where drugs are becoming an enemy equal to any foreign enemy 
sen pete wilson rcalif said he formally opposed involving 
the military but said he changed his mind because the drug flow 
has reached flood tide 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the plan 
shows that were serious about drugs 
an 1878 law the posse comitatus act prohibits the military 
from enforcing civilian laws although it was amended in 1981 to 
permit the military to provide more help to civilian antidrug 
agencies military planes and ships now pass along surveillance 
information on suspected drug traffickers to law enforcement 
officials 
but the posse comitatus act is only effective inside the 
territorial borders of the united states 
voting against the amendment were sens bill bradley dnj

the proposal would have required the retirement of the aging 
carriers midway and coral sea faster than the navy wanted 
defeated 5637 a plan by sen malcolm wallop rwyo to

against the accidental launch by an enemy of nuclear weapons the 
plan would have used technology now being studied for early phase

the budget for the strategic defense initiative as star wars is 
formally known from 46 billion to 4 billion and use the extra 
600 million for a variety of nonnuclear weapons the house bill

the un high commissioner for refugees should 
call an international conference to stem a chain reaction among 
southeast asian countries toward cutting off temporary asylum for 
people fleeing vietnam a private us refugee relief organization 
said friday 
the united states which has taken in about 1 million refugees 
from indochina must strongly support the move said the 
washingtonbased us committee for refugees 
unless the us government gives the problem new priority it 
will be to blame for permitting a vital humanitarian initiative 
to drift into dissolution the group added 
thailand lit the fuse in january when it began to push back 
vietnamese boats from its eastern and southern coastlines 
committee director roger winter said in a statement 
what we are seeing now is the predictable chain reaction to 
bar asylum throughout the region he said citing increased 
resistance to temporary asylum on the part of indonesia malaysia 
hong kong and the philippines 
we have known for some time that indonesia has been pushing 
boats back to sea but the first evidence that it was costing 
lives came april 24 when indonesian soldiers shot and killed one 
refugee and wounded another as a boat carrying 125 people attempted 
to land winter said 
the vessel finally managed to land at the malaysian camp of 
pulau bidong four days later he said but he added that malaysia 
has announced it will close this camp within a year and intends 
no longer to adopt a soft attitude to these illegal immigrants 
hong kong and the philippines also are reviewing their temporary 
asylum policies winter said declaring first asylum countries 
in the region are seeking a new restrictive consensus on 
tightening of their policies 
he gave these data on refugee problems since the start of 1988 
thailand more than 1500 vietnamese have been pushed back in 
operations that caused 170 deaths 
malaysia in the first quarter of the year 2921 vietnamese 
landed 
hong kong the year began with a camp population of 9532 more 
than 40 percent of whom had been in camps more than three years a 
hong kong official has urged that future arrivals be detained for 
return to vietnam 
the us state department has said it is in close consultation 
with thailand and other governments on the boat people problem 
malaysias ambassador to washington albert talalla said this 
week that his country is reaching the end of our tether in 
providing first asylum and pressure should be brought against 
hanoi to stop this exodus talalla also commended the united 
states as being the most generous of any country in providing 
permanent resettlement to follow temporary asylum

the swift cooperation between china and taiwan in 
handling the hijacking of a jet from the mainland is the latest 
sign that tensions are easing between the rival governments 
taiwan on friday returned the hijacked boeing 737 to china hours 
after it landed at a taiwanese military base with 118 people aboard 
the nationalists in taipei and the communists in beijing have 
been bitter enemies since they fought a bloody civil war in the 
1930s and 1940s the nationalists fled to the island province of 
taiwan in defeat in 1949 each side continues to call itself the 
legitimate ruler of all of china 
contact between chinese on the two sides of the 100mile wide 
taiwan straits was forbidden by both governments for decades and 
the two sides technically remain at war but since about 1980 
china has made peace overtures and taiwan has begun to ease its 
stubborn resistance to all links with the mainland 
unofficial contacts between the two sides have increased due to 
chinas decadelong pursuit of an opendoor policy and taiwans 
lifting of martial law last fall 
the greatest step in reestablishing ties came in october when 
taipei loosened a 38yearold ban on travel to china and began 
allowing those with relatives on the mainland to return for family 
reunions 
since then more than 65000 taiwanese have come to china and 
another 75000 have received permission to make the trip taiwans 
interior ministry reported last week 
indirect mail contact also has been established with the 
international red cross relaying mail from taiwan to the mainland 
and correspondence in the other direction going through hong kong 
chinas minister of posts and telecommunications in april again 
urged that direct mail contact be established 
indirect trade is flourishing also with hong kong as an 
intermediary such trade totalled at least 151 billion last year 
up 587 percent from 1986 
merchants on taiwan who in the past surreptitiously invested in 
businesses in their mainland ancestral towns have begun openly 
putting millions of dollars into mainland enterprises chinas 
official xinhua news agency said last week that 36 taiwanese 
businesses had invested a total of 285 million in xiamen a 
leading southeastern port 
both the nationalists and the communists seek reunification but 
only on their own terms china says taiwans capitalist system 
could remain untouched under the same onecountry two systems 
reunification plan that will be put into effect when hong kong a 
british colony returns to china in 1997 
under that program china says hong kong will be able to keep 
its capitalist system for at least 50 years following reunification 
the first signs of softening between the governments came in 
1986 when the pilot of a taiwanese airliner flew his plane to 
canton 
representatives of the communist and nationalist authorities met 
in hong kong to arrange the return of the plane in their first 
official contact since 1949 it took nearly three weeks to reach an 
agreement 
a desire to avoid a repeat of the 1986 negotiations may have 
been behind taiwans swift handling of thursdays hijacking 
taiwan granted political asylum to the two young hijackers but 
quickly refueled the plane and allowed it to return across the 
taiwan straits to xiamen where the flight originated 
the head of chinas national airline caac who earlier 
requested the return of the plane crew and hijackers sent a 
message to the civil aeronautic bureau of taiwan thanking it for 
its cooperation he made no mention of the two air pirates left 
behind 
taiwanese officials said friday morning they allowed the 
plane to leave and said it was flying to hong kong it actually 
flew directly to china 
on saturday taiwanese military officials said the taiwan 
garrison command recommended that two hijackers zhang qingguo 
27 and long guiyun 26 be prosecuted for the air piracy 
the officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
command recommended friday that the taipei district court charge 
the two with endangering flight safety

the taiwan garrison command recommended 
that two chinese hijackers already granted political asylum here 
be prosecuted for forcing a chinese jetliner to taiwan officials 
reported saturday 
military officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
command recommended friday that the taipei district court charge 
zhang qingguo 27 and long guiyun 26 with endangering flight 
safety the maximum sentence for committing such a crime is the 
death penalty 
lawmakers of the governing nationalist party said in a statement 
issued friday they the hijackers had noble goals but their 
methods were mean the two young workers commandeered the boing 
737 shortly after it took off thursday evening with 118 people 
aboard from communist chinas coastal city of xiamen in fujian 
province the two men made the pilot fly to a military air base in 
central taiwan 
after more than five hours in taiwan authorities allowed the 
plane to return to xiamen early friday morning with everyone aboard 
except the two hijackers who were quickly granted asylum no one 
was hurt 
government spokesman shaw yuming said friday the two hijackers 
were allowed to stay because they would have faced their doom 
if sent back home while denouncing hijacking he called their 
motives simple and noble 
the nationalist government which fled to taiwan from the 
chinese mainland after losing a civil war to the communists in 
1949 still claims to be the rightful ruler of all china and 
remains technically at war with beijing 
a group of nine legislators however condemned the two 
hijackers for threatening the lives of passengers aboard the plane 
and urged the government to treat them as criminals and put them on 
trial 
it was reported earlier that authorities and lawmakers here were 
concerned that the quick granting of asylum would tarnish taiwans 
image 
the incident was the first hijacking of a chinese commercial 
airliner to taiwan 
we would have been sending them to their doom if we turned 
them back to the communists shaw said 
they have risked their lives to seek freedom and democracy we 
must respect their wishes and offer them protection 
in a television interview the air pirates triumphantly detailed 
their doordie mission 
zhang a worker at an arsenal in south chinas yunnan province 
told the official chinese television service he and his companion 
long a steelworker from neighboring guizhou province used a toy 
pistol and a bottle of fake explosives to force the plane to taiwan 
late thursday 
we would have committed suicide if we failed zhang said in 
the televised interview we never planned to return to china 
in 1983 six chinese hijacked a chinese airliner to south korea 
and spent less than a year in jail there before resettling in 
taiwan where they received a heros welcome and financial support

authorities on friday turned back 13 
lebanese who arrived from beirut in line with toughened security 
checks after a car bomb explosion killed three people and wounded 
15 in the cypriot capital 
president george vassiliou said police would take greater 
steps to check foreigners who enter cyprus following the 
wednesday blast which police said was planned by two lebanese men 
and was a bungled attack on the israeli embassy 
the 13 were among 53 passengers mostly lebanese who were 
aboard the regular middle east airlines flight 261 that landed at 
larnaca friday 
buland sadek cyprus station manager for the lebanese national 
airline said police told him the 13 were declared not welcome and 
ordered to return to lebanon their passports were not given entry 
stamps and they later flew back to the lebanese capital aboard the 
same plane when it made its return flight 
an immigration department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said entry was refused because the 13 had not enough 
reason for staying in cyprus 
yasser arafat leader of the palestine liberation organization 
sent a message to vassiliou denouncing the bombing 
a government announcement said arafats message also expressed 
condolences for the victims 
the explosion brought angry demands for strong action against 
middle east terrorism on this mediterranean island nation 
vassiliou said counterterrorist units would be reinforced 
particularly with a view to follow up the activities of arab 
visitors 
the local plo office issued a statement shortly after the blast 
denying involvement and denouncing this ugly crime 
earlier an anonymous caller telephoned the american television 
network nbc in new york claiming responsibility for the blast in 
the name of the notorious antiarafat palestinian terrorist leader 
sabri albanna better known as abu nidal 
police kept the explosivesladen car from parking in front of 
the embassy and it exploded on a bridge 200 yards away killing 
the driver and two cypriot passersby

democratic presidential frontrunner michael dukakis came under

labeled him naive at best on defense and jesse jackson said the

dukakis kept up his criticism of the administrations handling 
of negotiations aimed at persuading panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noriega to relinquish power noriega is under indictment in the 
united states on drug charges 
the vice president told reporters when asked about the 
negotiations i said i would not comment on it but he went on 
to say i want to see change i want to see him brought to 
justice 
bush told workers at a hughes aircraft corp plant in fullerton

thinking he said the soviets respect only strength and to 
think that they would agree to cuts in their strategic and 
conventional arsenals in the face of unilateral american 
abandonment of major weapons programs is the height of folly 
jackson met privately in san francisco with new york gov mario 
cuomo who afterward praised both democratic candidates and 
restated his belief that the frontrunner after california and 
new jersey should be supported at the convention 
cuomo appearing with jackson at a news conference following 
their 1hour meeting said the democrats need jesse jackson 
personally if not as the nominee and he is surely the underdog 
we need his wholehearted participation in the process 
cuomo hailed dukakis as a man of great intelligence great 
sensitivity and great practicality 
in keeping with cuomos unifiedparty theme jackson muted his 
criticism of dukakis during the joint appearance saying he and his 
democratic rival fundamentally are on the same side of history 
but in an interview published friday jackson said dukakis drug 
war plan is a farce and he described the massachusetts 
governor as sounding little different from bush on various issues 
all three presidential candidates were in california the last 
big prize of the primary season and more importantly the biggest 
bloc of electoral votes at stake in the general election 
strategists in both parties regard california with 47 electoral 
votes as crucial to the prospects of both bush and dukakis the 
two likely rivals appeared to be campaigning with an eye to 
november rather than to the june 7 primary 
with more than enough delegates for the gop presidential 
nomination bush was using his campaign appearances as to attack 
dukakis the allbutcertain democratic presidential nominee 
the massachusetts governor expects the final round of democratic 
primaries on june 7 including new jersey new mexico and montana 
as well as california to give him the delegate majority he needs 
for the nomination 
dukakis said he has not begun to consider the selection of a 
running mate 
asked if he would consider someone who had supported aid to the 
contra rebels in central america dukakis replied that no single 
issue would be a disqualification 
theres no way under the sun i could possibly pick a running 
mate who agreed with me on every single issue he said im not 
going to be looking for a clone of michael dukakis 
jackson refused to let up on his criticism of the party 
frontrunner 
in an interview with the new york times jackson compared 
dukakis to bush 
both of them brag about being vague both of them are trying 
to make bland beautiful like bush dukakis almost brags about 
putting forth no plans like bush dukakis says i have not said 
anything concrete to anybody about anything 
in an appearance at a drug treatment center in los angeles 
jackson said dukakis has not put forth a comprehensive plan and 
the presidents plan is limited 
dukakis was in daly city a san francisco suburb and he 
responded to jacksons statements by saying it will come as a 
surprise to the white house and mr bush if my views on the world 
and my style of political leadership has any similarity to his 
dukakis said the massachusetts program of drug prevention and 
education had brought a significant reduction in drug use among 
students 
he used a speech to high school students about drug abuse to 
renew his attack on reports the administration was considering 
dropping drug charges against noriega if he agrees to relinquish 
power 
we are not talking about stealing hubcaps he said 
bush portrayed dukakis views on defense as similar to those of 
george mcgovern and to the left of those of former president carter 
and former vice president walter mondale 
even jimmy carter and walter mondale supported weapons 
systems that governor dukakis opposes bush said the 
governors views are naive at best and if implemented would be 
dangerous to the defense of this country 
madeleine albright a dukakis foreign policy adviser responded 
what bush is trying to do is use 1970s arguments to face the 
challenges of the 1990s

new york gov mario cuomo on friday praised 
jesse jacksons leadership vision and contributions to the 
democratic party but firmly restated his neutrality until after 
june 7 in the race between jackson and michael dukakis for the 
democratic nomination for president 
cuomo and jackson held a joint news conference following a 
1hour private meeting which cuomo said he requested 
cuomo who ranked near the top of many polls of presidential 
contenders until he unequivocally ruled out a draft on his behalf 
praised both jackson and dukakis and said the differences between 
them were minor 
agreeing with cuomos unifiedparty theme jackson muted his 
recent criticism of dukakis during the news conference and joined 
in praise of the massachusetts governor saying we fundamentally 
are on the same side of history 
i do not believe michael dukakis would handle allegations of 
impropriety by attorney general ed meese the way vice president 
george bush has mike dukakis would handle south africa quite 
differently from george bush jackson added 
jackson was campaigning in san francisco for californias june 7 
democratic primary where 336 delegates are at stake cuomo was in 
the city to deliver a fundraising address for democratic rep 
nancy pelosi of san francisco 
cuomo brushed aside questions of why he asked jackson to meet 
with him by joking that it helps him politically with some groups 
to be seen with jackson 
the two described their topics of discussion as politics and 
unifying the democratic party after the nominating convention in 
july 
cuomo said he didnt think jacksons recent criticism of dukakis 
as someone who lacks vision would hurt the party saying i think 
this is a legitimate and productive process 
responding to questions about his plans for endorsing a 
candidate cuomo repeated his earlier statement that the 
frontrunner after california and new jersey should be supported at 
the convention 
that position almost guarantees cuomos eventual endorsement of 
dukakis according to the associated press delegate count dukakis 
has 1597 and jackson has 944 a total of 2081 delegates are 
needed to nominate 
but jackson immediately praised cuomos stand on an endorsement 
saying that waiting until after june 7 is the appropriate thing 
to do that was the governors commitment and he has remained true 
to his position 
cuomo balanced his references to what appears to be a future 
dukakis endorsement with lavish praise of jackson 
the democratic party needs the rev jackson for his personal 
input for his personal capacity for his ability to deal with the 
issues intelligently not just to articulate them which he does 
with eloquence and effectiveness but understanding the issues 
especially questions of foreign policy cuomo said 
he said the party needs jesse jackson personally if not as 
the nominee and he is surely the underdog we need his 
wholehearted participation in the process 
if anyone fails to see that then they dont deserve to be in 
positions of leadership in our party cuomo said 
dukakis is a man of great intelligence great sensitivity and 
great practicality cuomo said adding im certain he knows as 
clearly as i do and perhaps more clearly how important jesse is 
to the process 
in other appearances friday jackson continued to put the fight 
against drugs at the center of his presidential platform and he 
criticized the just say no antidrug campaign sponsored by the 
administration 
earlier at a los angelesarea treatment center jackson shook 
hands with addicts blasted street gangs and said dukakis lacks a 
strong antidrug policy during a campaign stop at a narcotics 
treatment center 
so far the governor has not put forth a comprehensive plan 
and the presidents plan is limited jackson said there is the 
jesse jackson proposal there is the reaganbush proposal at this 
time there is no other for the war on drugs 
as he campaigned in oregon and los angeles jackson criticized a 
proposed deal between the reagan administration and panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega who is under indictment on drug 
charges 
its not enough to just say no out of one side of the white 
house then have drug dealers on the cia payroll on the other side 
of the white house he said at a portland ore news conference 
our childrens lives are at stake

poets lit candles and released 11 balloons 
friday to mark the moment three years ago that police bombed a 
rowhouse held by the radical group move in a fiery battle that left 
11 people dead 
meanwhile police girded against the possibility of violence by 
move members in the nowrebuilt neighborhood devastated by 1985 
fire barricades manned by police officers were erected at either 
end of one street 
at a memorial service about 50 people listened to poetry about 
the battle at 527 pm about 40 lit candles at the exact time 
police dropped the bomb to dislodge a rooftop bunker the bomb 
touched off a fire that destroyed 61 houses 
lamont b steptoe released 11 white balloons and his voice 
echoed off nearby independence hall as he recited a poem in which 
he said the fire has never gone out there will always be a 
fire for us 
the tone at the ceremony was decidedly bitter with participants 
criticizing the longawaited report of a grand jury that 
investigated the event for two years the grand jury last week 
blasted blasted mayor w wilson goode and other city officials for 
morally reprehensible behavior but recommended no criminal 
charges 
justice has to be served before you can forgive i think 
said bob small who read some of his poetry its like they had 
the nuremberg trial then found the nazis innocent 
at osage avenue the site of the shootout and fire 527 pm 
came and went with few people noticing the time children rode 
bikes and scooters in the narrow street and a number of people sat 
in front of rowhomes rebuilt two years ago 
a move member not involved in the battle was released from 
prison friday after serving time for her role in an earlier 
confrontation with police and there was concern that move members 
would gather on the street as they had done for the last two years 
on may 13 
earl watkins sitting in front of his rebuilt house almost 
directly across from the site of the old move house said he hoped 
they would not show 
this is my prayer that nothing happens tonight in fact im 
hoping that this is the end of it anyway said watkins 76 
we went through all that mess and then every year we have to 
put up with this watkins said gazing down the street at the 
barricade where a tv truck had pulled away i think this is the 
end of it i think it will be if the media let it go

a lethal computer virus called black friday 
was timed to destroy thousands of computer files in israeli 
businesses and homes on friday the 13th but experts said most 
users were alerted in time 
no early reports of damage surfaced 
virus is computer jargon for a fragment of computer program 
or software that can copy itself into other programs and usually 
is destructive 
an unidentified saboteur planted the black friday virus and it 
spread to thousands of personal computers this year as users copied 
or used each others software 
infected computers were hit in two ways the virus slowed down 
the computer and also specified that programs activated on friday 
may 13 would be wiped out 
data stored in the computers would not be affected 
its a time bomb that penetrates your computer without your 
being able to know about it said shay bushinsky a tel 
avivbased computer consultant 
the perfect analogy is aids if you dont exchange programs 
with others you remain immune but if you freely copy your 
friends software you are in danger of being contaminated 
no figures were available on the extent of the contamination 
among israels 90000 personal computer users but bushinsky 
estimated that the infection rate reached 100 percent among heavy 
users 
hebrew university researchers detected the black friday virus on 
dec 24 because of a flaw in its design said yisrael radai a 
senior programmer at the university 
instead of infecting each program once the virus attached 
itself to the program every time it was used consuming increasing 
amounts of memory space 
computer experts noticed that supposedly static programs were 
growing in size after an intensive search they isolated the virus 
the university then developed antiviral software and made 
it available to the schools hundreds of personal computer users 
free of charge said radai 
to be on the safe side users affiliated with the university 
were also urged not to activate their computers on friday may 13 
he added 
software companies joined the fight 
the tel avivbased iris company developed an antivirus program 
and sold 4000 copies said president ofer ahituv he estimated 
that 30 percent of his companys 6000 customers most of them 
businesses had been infected 
ahituv and other computer experts said they had no immediate 
reports of damage friday apparently because most users were warned 
in time 
black friday was the first destructive virus to contaminate 
personal computers in israel but programmers predicted there would 
be others 
they said one reason israeli users are vulnerable is that 
software prices here are about twice as high as in the united 
states and many israelis freely copy programs often disregarding 
copyright restrictions 
ahituv speculated that the saboteur may have been a frustrated 
programmer who finally got fed up because everyone was copying 
his software and then said let all the software be destroyed

a middlebury college council friday 
recommended a years suspension for a fraternity that hung a 
mutilated bloodied female mannequin from a balcony during a toga 
party 
the council made up of students faculty members and staff 
deliberated four hours before reaching the decision 
the recommendation goes to college president olin robison who 
has the final say on the fate of delta upsilon which dangled the 
mannequin from its fraternity house last weekend 
the council recommended the fraternity be banned and its members 
prohibited from living in the house for a year after which the 
council would decide whether to close the fraternity suspend it 
another year or allow its return on probation 
the council also recommended that fraternity members and others 
at the 1950student liberal arts college participate in a 
sexismawareness program said college spokesman ron nief 
im definitely pleased that some sort of awareness program 
will begin said jennifer weiss a student who wrote a letter 
of complaint about the incident i think that the point i was 
interested in making was brought to light hopefully the awareness 
will continue 
the president of delta upsilon at middlebury said that the 
punishment was too stiff and that publicity about the incident 
influenced the councils decision 
i felt in some ways we were guilty before we were even 
tried said mark lahive it was not aimed to be a public 
display against women at all there was no harm intended 
it wasnt a statement at all 
lahive said the fraternity would ask its alumni to lobby on the 
groups behalf 
weiss and six other students wrote a letter to robison that said 
the mannequin was hung with a rope around its neck its head bashed 
in and its breasts dripping with what looked like blood

the discovery of chemical abnormalities in 
depressed teenagers intent on killing themselves could provide a

selfdestruct researchers say 
the things we learn on this may well help future tests to

difference in the treatment said dr neal d ryan assistant 
professor of psychiatry at the university of pittsburgh

growth hormone than those of healthy teenagers according to 
research by ryan and dr joaquin puigantich professor of 
psychiatry at pitt 
the study reported thursday at the american psychiatric 
associations annual meeting in montreal is believed to be the 
first to demonstrate neurochemical abnormalities in suicidal

something that goes on with the brain and there are environmental

colonial historians want to restore a 
fivemile stretch of road where paul revere was captured and the 
first shots of the american revolution were fired to the way it 
looked circa 1776 
but people who live along battle road dont exactly revere the 
idea of reverting the highway to a cow path you call turning a 
paved road into dirt progress asked one 
the section of route 2a that connects lexington and concord is 
just another highway to most but american history buffs consider 
it a hallowed site 
supporters of a national parks service plan to restore battle 
road include retired house speaker thomas p tip oneill and 
thomas boylston adams scion of the family that produced two us 
presidents and revolutionary firebrand samuel adams

willie b found its a jungle out there 
zoo atlantas famous gorilla saw something friday he hasnt seen 
since he was captured in africa 27 years ago green grass beneath 
his feet and open sky above his head 
as reporters and photographers watched from behind trees and 
across a protective moat the 30yearold lowland gorilla stepped 
hesitantly into his new outdoor quarters a 45 million simulated 
rain forest where he will live near 13 other gorillas and a host of 
other apes 
skeptical of those watching him he spent almost an hour 
stepping back and forth from his enclosed shelter before he seemed 
secure enough to run atop his hill scamper for food and begin

it would seem unlikely that a woman who allows 
her son to die could be a sympathetic character but she is when 
rosanna arquette plays her in the cbs movie about obsessive 
religious belief promised a miracle so it was surprising to 
hear arquette say with some vehemence that she was so repulsed by 
what alice lucky parker and her husband larry did that she 
didnt even want to meet them 
promised a miracle is based on larry parkers book we let 
our son die the parkers were so convinced that their diabetic 
son wesley had been healed by god that they stood by while he 
lapsed into a coma and died even then they thought he would rise 
from the dead like lazarus 
the movie airing thursday is a simple highly emotional story 
and therefore a real actors vehicle judge reinhold bestknown 
for such comedies as beverly hills cop and ruthless people 
takes a rare dramatic turn he and arquette turn in stunning 
performances as the fundamentalist couple clinging to their beliefs 
rather than facing the horror of what they have done 
arquette played a reallife character before in her critically 
acclaimed performance as convicted killer gary gilmores 
girlfriend nicole in the madefortv movie executioners 
song for that role arquette met the real nicole this time she 
didnt meet the reallife characters until playing the role 
convinced her they werent monsters 
i had such strong reactions to the script and what they did i 
didnt really want to meet them in the beginning said arquette 
i think this was a terrible tragedy and what they did was 
horrible thing i ended up meeting them towards the very end like 
the last day of shooting 
when i first read the script my initial reaction was like 
shock and i was so angry how could people let this happen then i 
found out from the producers that its happening all around the 
country it happened yesterday a 2yearold girl had bowel 
obstruction her parents prayed over her and she died 
in a situation like that when you could save a childs life 
especially with something like insulin for a diabetic its wrong 
it really is so i didnt have a sympathetic point of view at all 
until i started playing the character 
in a touching courtroom scene lucky is on the witness stand 
trying to explain why she believed so fervently in the miracle 
the family had fallen on hard times after larry was laid off 
this miracle this wonderful thing came along and it was 
gonna lift us up lucky says it was gonna put us back on our 
feet if we believe it we had to believe it or give up on life 
the parkers had help believing from their pastor john 
vickery who finally reluctantly suggested they should consult a 
doctor to verify the healing and from luckys prayer group 
they all believed that wesleys worsening symptoms were the work of 
satan testing their faith 
the parkers accept their sons death only after a wrenching 
revelatory scene that so mortifies larry he bolts from the house 
and runs down the road leaving lucky screaming in the front yard 
so it was very powerful arquette said judge reinhold and 
i had a very hard time we shot it in 20 days intense schedule 
and also as we were doing those scenes i could not believe that 
this was happening how could they have let this happen and i got 
ill from it really 
the movie was ably directed by stephen gyllenhaal who also 
directed the nbctv movie open season the abduction of kari 
swenson 
arquette is bestknown for her starring role opposite madonna in 
desperately seeking susan but she won praise for her earlier 
work in john sayles independent feature film baby its you 
and she also starred in martin scorseses black comedy after 
hours 
after a stop in new york to plug the cbs movie she was on her 
way to the cannes film festival in france where her latest feature 
a frenchamerican film directed by luc besson the big blue 
was set to premiere

the economic outlook continues to improve 
although with a growing bias toward higher wages and prices 
according to the latest quarterly survey of small businesses 
based on written responses to a detailed questionaire the 
business people expressed faith in higher sales over the next three 
months and supported that view with plans to expand employment 
the survey for the 500000member national federation of 
independent business also found a recordlow level of planning to 
borrow suggesting smaller businesses are finding profits and cash 
flow sufficient for their needs 
the low level of borrowing tends to insulate smaller businesses 
from the impact of the recent tightening of monetary policy and 
separates them sharply from the heavy borrowing by government 
consumers and financial markets 
in releasing the results professor william dunkelberg dean of 
temple universitys business school and originator of the survey 
commented that monetary policy does not appear to have been 
particularly restrictive during the last four years nor is credit 
availability a problem now 
other commentators have observed that the reliance on internal 
financing rather than borrowing reflects not only a distaste for 
the level of interest rates but a lingering fear of the tight 
credit conditions of the 1970s 
the smallbusiness survey is closely watched for indications of 
things to come since the companies involved employ about onehalf 
the private nonfarm work force and produce about 50 percent of 
gross national product 
dunkelberg reported that the smallbusiness optimism index 
compiled since 1974 rose to 1022 from 1018 in january on a 
seasonally adjusted basis continuing a pattern of slightly above 
or below 100 since 1985 
the index which assumes conditions that existed in 1978 equal 
100 reached a seasonally adjusted high of 1087 in january 1984 
and a low of 811 in april 1980 
the index is compiled from data distilled from the survey and 
includes expected business conditions the climate for expansion 
earnings job openings and hiring plans and plans for capital 
outlays 
while the april report was generally bullish and even stronger 
than that of january dunkelberg observed that companies have 
become decidedly less optimistic about future expansion each april 
since 1983 
apparently many believe that the law of gravity applies to 
economic statistics as well as apples he said noting that 
views about the possibility of further growth are about as weak 
now as in 1980 
however he added that while the numbers might be similar the 
reasons for them are not 
in 1980 he said 48 percent of respondents expected a 
deterioration of the economy while in 1988 particularly in many 
regions of the country businesses just figure it cant get any 
better 
among details of the report 
twentyfive percent of all companies plan to increase total 
employment in the next three months while 5 percent plan 
reductions 
these are the second strongest hiring plans recorded since 
1978 on a seasonally adjusted basis the strongest were recorded 
last january 
hiring plans were especially strong in manufacturing with 33 
percent planning to increase employment and only 4 percent planning 
reductions 
although plans to raise prices fell from january levels over a 
longer period there has been a clear upward shift in such 
plans dunkelberg based this conclusion on a comparison with 
figures for april in the prior two years 
with job openings at expansionhigh levels there is still 
little evidence that compensation might be responding to any 
tightness in the labor market 
nevertheless dunkelberg observes that this year could deliver 
a bit more inflation than currently expected

more than a dozen men and women who know 
ronald reagan or have served him in the white house have written 
books and they largely agree on a portrayal of an affable yet 
hesitant chief executive manipulated by a protective wife and an 
imageconscious staff 
from the white house chef to the reagan offspring michael 
reagan and patti davis from the disenchanted economic whiz david 
t stockman to the secretary of state who left in a huff alexander 
m haig almost all sing the tune sung by michael deaver who was 
so close to the reagans they considered him a son 
ronald reagan sort of glided through life deaver said in 
behind the scenes he said he and nancy reagan became a team 
united by our shared belief that her husband needed to be 
protected whether he wanted it or not 
over and over the books make the point reagan is a benign 
president who had to be manipulated for his own good 
haig in caveat realism reagan and foreign policy 
describes the president as a sort of shadowy figure because of 
his reagans habitual courtesy it is at times difficult to know 
when he is agreeing or disagreeing approving or disapproving 
haig wrote describing the president as a listener absorbing the 
views of his advisers who gave little indication of his own 
position 
larry speakes the former presidential spokesman caused a 
sensation in his book speaking out in disclosing that he felt 
he knew reagan so well he could feed the press quotes on crucial 
international matters that reagan never made 
stockman portrays reagan as a wellmeaning yet simple man 
reagan did not appreciate the vast web of confusion and 
selfdelusion i was creating in 1981 when he concocted the tax 
and budget cuts to be pushed through congress stockman wrote in 
the triumph of politics 
donald t regan former chief of staff in the most recent and 
most devastating book for the record says reagan was 
programmed by his staff to run through a daily schule as a movie 
actor runs through a shooting schedule this fascination with 
image produced a strange effect regan wrote ronald reagan 
seemed to be regarded by certain members of his inner circle not as 
the powerful and utterly original leader that he was but as a sort 
of supreme anchorman whose public persona was the most important 
elements of the presidency 
scholar martin anderson former assistant to the president for 
policy development in revolution complains of reagans 
undemanding nature ronald reagan had one distinctive 
personality trait that was highly unusual perhaps unique for 
someone who rose to the high level of managerial responsibility he 
attained he made no demands and gave almost no instructions 
from former white house chef henry haller comes the tamest 
most harmless expose chef haller confides that the man who loves 
simple homestyle meals of macaroni and cheese hamburger soup 
and meat loaf also sneaks in duck a lorange at stag lunches or 
dinners when his wife is out of town 
there are contradictions in these portraits if reagan is such a 
voracious newspaper reader as both deaver and regan contend in 
their works how can the president say he didnt know speakes put 
those dramatic words in his mouth 
yet even when many profess personal admiration for the 
president the descriptions that emerged were less than kind 
stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings institution and a 
specialist on the presidency says each book must be read through 
the filter of who these guys are and whats bugging them but 
that each one also provides a piece of the mosaic 
its the parable of the blind men and the elephant each one 
is touching a different part and describing it differently hess 
said 
taking note of regans and stockmans books hess pointed to 
their underlying common theme 
what comes through in all the books from the earliest on is 
what at best could be called a handsoff presidency and at worst 
an inattentive one said hess its interesting that the same 
president who is on the cover of fortune magazine touting his 
management style is also the same president who presided over the 
problems of the irancontra affair 
the most recent book to capture the headlines has been regans 
primarily for its revelation that the first lady controlled the 
presidents schedule in consultation with an astrologer 
regan bolsters the negative image put forward by stockman 
deaver and speakes 
in his book regan faults the president for a distaff 
presidency that was hesitant and indecisive he charged that 
reagan laid down no rules and articulated no mission for his 
cabinet officers this is dangerous regan wrote 
he describes a president so unwilling to bother others that he 
sat in his west wing office eyes smarting even though smoke 
billowed from a clogged chimney 
here is how anderson a senior fellow at the hoover institute on 
the campus of stanford university in california characterizes 
reagan he is highly intelligent with a photographic memory he 
has a gift for absorbing great amounts of diverse information and 
is capable of combining various parts of that information into new 
coherent packages and then conveying his thoughts and ideas clearly 
and concisely in a way that is understandable to almost anyone 
but anderson says reagan made decisions like an ancient king 
or a turkish pasha passively letting his subjects serve him 
rarely did he ask searching questions and demand to know why 
someone had or had not done something 
stockman recalling a 20minute lecture he gave the president on 
taxes wrote what do you do when your president ignores all the 
palpable relevant facts and wanders in circles i could not bear 
to watch this good and decent man go on in this embarrassing way

and if reagan is faulted for being an outoftouch president 
adopted son michael hits him for being a distant father ive 
spent my life trying to figure out how to make ronald reagan my 
friend reagan said after publication of his book from the 
outside looking in he quoted his father as saying my god i 
though just telling you i loved you was all i had to do 
lou cannon the white house correspondent for the washington 
post who has covered reagan since his days in california says no 
one should be surprised by the descriptions of reagans handsoff 
style 
if anyone interested in the presidency didnt know we had a 
laidback president they must have been on mars cannon said 
i never could understand stockmans book that he was surprised 
reagan was such a delegator and a softie 
cannon also pointed to another theme running through the books 
this administration had done a lot to foster the notion that 
greed is good and these authors clearly demonstrate that he 
said noting the milliondollar advances some books have garnered 
cannon who wrote the authoritative reagan in 1981 and has a 
second book on the president due a year after he leaves office 
said books by administration aides show how much reagan depended 
upon the people he chose to work with it functioned well with 
someone like james baker iii working as his chiefofstaff but not 
someone like regan cannon contended 
regans management style was to eliminate everybody else 
cannon said ever since his days in california reagan worked with 
a roundtable style where he heard his advisers out and then made a 
decision the writer said he did it in california and hes 
doing it today these books wont change his style 
ironically education secretary terrel h bell whose department 
was targeted for destruction in the early days of the 
administration comes to reagans defense in his book the 
thirteenth man 
bell takes issue with stockman contending the embittered 
director of the office of management and budget really didnt 
understand the president and how he worked 
reagan often made decisions on budget and other matters that i 
did not like some of which made me angry but i never felt that 
his policies were aimless or wandering or lacked clear focus 
bell wrote ronald reagan made decisions david stockman did not 
like maybe this was the source of daves complaints ronald 
reagan was a decisive leader and it is inaccurate to portray him 
otherwise 
regan does manage to defend reagan and himself from the 
charge that they knew anything about the diversion of funds to the 
contra rebels from the sale of weapons to iran 
and at times regans book did give the president credit for 
being alert and interested in complicated issues four days after 
his surgery for colon cancer the president held a 45minute 
discussion of the budget the tax reform bill and the future of 
social security during a visit with vice president george bush 
regan wrote 
the former chief of staff also contended that the process reagan 
used created an atmosphere of confidence and political dynamism 
that allowed the longest period of economic recovery and the 
highest levels of employment ever to flower 
stockman argued however that reagans dream of a minimized 
central government never had a chance because the president lacked 
the stomach to take on the welfare state he was a consensus 
politician not an ideologue stockman said revolution wasnt 
in his bones 
deaver who had worked with reagan since his days as governor of 
california warned in his book that many have underestimated reagan 
because of his uncomplicated ideas and style 
there it is again a man whose simple tastes are said by his 
enemies to match his intellect that judgment has cost them many a 
victory deaver wrote 
another theme threading through the deaver and regan books is 
the invasive role of the first lady 
regan asserts that mrs reagan checked virtually every major 
move and decision with an astrologer by humoring her we had 
given her control regan wrote no one except me and least of 
all the president was disposed to interfere with that 
it has received little notice in the rash of stories zeroing in 
on the first ladys fascination with astrology but regan wrote in 
his forward that the practice did the country no irreparable 
damage 
although deaver never told of the stargazing he described the 
first lady as a woman who had a pervasive amount of influence in 
personnel matters as well as policy 
because reagan was completely unable to deal with close 
personal conflict deaver wrote when problems arose related to 
the family or with the personnel in his office nancy had to carry 
the load 
she lobbied the president to soften his line on the soviet 
union to reduce military spending and not to push star wars at the 
expense of the poor and dispossessed she favored a diplomatic 
solution in nicaragua and opposed his trip to bitburg nancy wins 
most of the time when she does it is not by wearing him down but 
by usually being on the right side of an issue deaver wrote 
the reading public has only to wait to find out more secrets 
not only is former national security adviser robert c mcfarlane 
reportedly working on a book education secretary william bennett 
promises one too 
both the president and the first lady have warned theyll tell 
their side of the story and they say they are taking notes

levolor lorentzen inc which pioneered the 
manufacture of decorator window miniblinds may be up for sale 
because of a rift among family members who own the 77yearold 
parsippanybased company 
the privatelyheld company has hired an unidentified broker to 
evaluate its worth and marketability according to a company 
spokesman 
theres a family dispute the family dispute does not affect 
daytoday operations said the spokesman who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the problem apparently centers on the stake controlled by jane 
lorentzen the widow of one of the company founders three 
children she holds between 40 percent and 49 percent of levolors 
stock said levolors general counsel bohdan porytko 
the other major shareholders are chairman eric lorentzen who 
has majority voting control and his sister karen lynam they and 
jane lorentzens husband h peter lorentzen who was vice chairman 
and died three years ago are the offspring of company founder hans 
k lorentzen 
porytko would not comment in detail on the family squabble but 
did say jane lorentzen had approached other stockholder family 
members to discuss what could be done to make the shares held by 
peter lorentzens estate more liquid 
family discussions after the brokers evaluation could lead to 
a number of options he said porytko would not rule out sale of 
the jane lorentzen stake to other family members or the companys 
sale to an outsider 
according to an industry source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity several home furnishing concerns have examined the 
possibility of buying levolor but have dropped the idea 
eric lorentzen could not be reached for comment thursday and did 
not return a telephone message 
but in a statement last week he said 
my father who founded the company hans k lorentzen would 
state that everything is for sale at the right price except my wife 
and children it should be pointed out given that philosophy that 
the company has remained in the lorentzen family for 77 years 
levolor has become one of the most recognized brand names in the 
socalled alternative window covering business with its 
colorful and fashionable miniblinds replacing the image of 
oldfashioned wide dusty venetian blinds 
through marketing that captured the imagination of designers 
interior decoration magazines and consumers levolor has taken a 
major portion of the more than 12 billion wholesale market for 
hard window coverings with its 1inch miniblinds halfinch 
microblinds vertical blinds and pleated blinds 
the company did a brilliant job of marketing of developing a 
product consciousness as well as a brand consciousness said 
donald hogsett business editor of the trade publication home 
textiles today 
levolor claims as its innovations an early device that better 
lowers and raises blinds evenly and a plastic wand to operate the 
slats 
in fact the company derives its name from the leveling device 
lev a wheel symbol representing it o and the first three 
letters of the family name lor 
porytko said 1987 sales were between 200 million and 300 
million the company has been valued at 100 million but porytko 
disputes the figure 
levolors 3000 employees work at 20 locations nationwide its 
major buyer is sears roebuck and co

ford motor co is building its financial services 
division as well as it core automaking business and is seeking a 
major acquisition in the electronics industry ford chairman donald 
petersen said 
the no 2 automaker has about 10 billion in cash reserves and 
has been seeking a major acquisition for some time but petersen 
said hes in no hurry 
weve become quite impressed by how many more poor 
acquisitions have been made than good ones by other companies 
petersen told reporters after the companys 33rd annual 
shareholders meeting on thursday 
petersen estimated fords financial services group eventually 
would contribute as much as 30 percent of corporate profits due to 
expansion and acquisitions he did not give a time frame however 
the financial services division which includes ford motor 
credit and first nationwide currently contributes about 18 percent 
to fords earnings 
at general motors corp financial services contributed 42 
percent of 1987 earnings but gm spokesman terry sullivan said the 
figure was higher than usual because of very low automotive 
earnings 
by contrast general motors acceptance corp the subsidiary 
which contains gm financial service businesses contributed about 
26 percent of gms earnings in 1985 
petersen also said ford would reduce its equity in hertz he 
said the company bought the auto rental and leasing firm as a 
defensive move 
hertz could have been acquired by a company that would not 
continue the close relationship with ford in buying ford cars he 
said after the meeting 
ford spokesman tom foote said ford owns at least 90 percent of 
hertz with hertz management holding the rest of the company 
petersen said ford has raised its forecast of 1988 auto industry 
sales imported and domestic to 153 million 102 million cars 
and 51 million trucks from 15 million forecasted earlier 
we think the general economy is going on quite well 
petersen said after the meeting adding theres every reason to 
believe our economy will continue its modest growth in 1989 
attendance at fridays annual meeting was the lowest in fords 
history coinciding with a year in which fords earnings were the 
highest in automotive history 
ford earned 46 billion in 1987 and another record 16 billion 
in the first quarter of 1988 
it also was the first meeting since henry ford iis death and 
the first meeting since fords son edsel ford ii and his nephew 
william clay ford jr were elected to fords board of directors in 
january 
henry ford ii died in september at age 70 edsel ford ii 39 is 
general sales manager of the lincolnmercury division william clay

halliburton co has agreed to acquire 
gearhart industries for about 275 million in cash and stock the 
oilfield services companies have announced 
but a houstonbased oil service company challenging the merger 
plan has doubled its position in gearhart senior debt notes and 
the businesses face other hurdles in the plan 
energy service co has acquired 372 million in principal 
amount of the 8percent senior subordinated notes issued by 
gearhart officials said that raises enscos ownership of senior 
notes to 667 million in principal amount which represents a 
majority of that debt series class officials said 
the additional debt notes acquired gives us a controlling 
position in that class of gearhart debt said cris gaut enscos 
chief financial officer the halliburtongearhart merger plan 
wasnt a done deal gaut said 
the acquisition was contingent on final agreements with gearhart 
creditors and approval by gearhart shareholders and federal 
regulators 
us justice department officials said they were reviewing the 
plan 
in the plan gearhart common and preferred shareholders would 
receive less than proposed in an earlier offer so that halliburton 
can increase the payout to holders of gearhart debt and redeemable 
preferred stock 
halliburton under the definitive agreement would exchange 
02917 of a share of its own stock for each outstanding share of 
gearhart common stock and three series of gearhart preferred stock 
target date for completing the merger is aug 31 according to 
chairman marvin gearhart 
halliburton closed thursday at 3237 a share up 87 cents on 
the new york stock exchange based on that price the stock swap 
would be worth about 94 cents per share of gearhart which closed 
at about 87 cents a share down 625 cents on the nyse 
in a tentative agreement announced feb 24 the initial exchange 
ratio was for 03575 shares of halliburton for each gearhart share 
officials said the exchange ratio was lowered in order to 
increase the amount paid to holders of certain gearhart senior 
debt subordinated debt and redeemable preferred stock these debt 
and securities holders would receive about 230 million in cash 
in late february the companies first announced merger plans 
the muchsmaller gearhart is based in fort worth and provides

navistar international corps sale of its 
moneylosing wisconsin steel unit in 1977 was part of a strategy to 
leave the steel business not an attempt to avoid pension 
obligations to workers a company attorney says 
but lawyers for two plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the 
chicagobased manufacturing concern said thursday they would prove 
navistar misled wisconsin steels buyer into believing the company 
could be profitable 
the longawaited us district court trial that began thursday 
is considered an important test case to determine whether and to 
what extent a company can be forced to honor pensionplan 
obligations to workers 
navistar faces two lawsuits resulting from the illfated 1977 
sale of wisconsin steel to envirodyne inc a los angelesbased 
engineering company with no previous steelmaking experience 
the south side chicago steel mill went bankrupt eight years ago 
putting 3500 employees out of work and leaving the pension benefit 
guaranty corp the federal insurer of pensions with the tab for 
unpaid pension benefits 
in the bench trial before us district judge james moran the 
pension insurer is seeking 140 million from navistar to cover the 
unpaid benefits plus interest 
and wisconsin steel creditors led by an envirodyne unit the 
edc holding co have filed a separate lawsuit seeking triple 
damages of nearly 475 million from navistar 
that suit alleges fraud and racketeering in the sale of the 
steel company in 1977 when the company had a string of five years 
of financial losses 
navistar attorney philip beck said in his opening argument that 
wisconsins steel demise was the result of a combination of 
external factors including a sixmonth strike against navistar 
a wisconsin steel customer immediately before the mill collapsed 
in 1980 and the effects of two successive harsh winters 
and he denied that navistar known as international harvester 
co in 1977 intended to dupe envirodyne in the sale for which it 
lent envirodyne 50 million of the 65 million acquisition price 
rather beck said the sale was part of navistars move out of 
the steel business in order to concentrate on its core 
farmequipment and truckmanufacturing businesses 
but pensioninsurer attorney william o bittman said company 
officials ignored recommendations from their investment bankers 
lehman bros that the sale was financially questionable because 
envirodyne lacked the experience and funds to turn the steel 
company around 
he said company officials were aware at the time that the deal 
might lead to lawsuits if the steel company went bankrupt but went 
ahead with the sale to envirodyne in order to avoid 167 million in 
losses it faced by liquidating wisconsin steel 
i think navistar sold wisconsin steel to a buyer that they 
knew did not have the experience or the financial wherewithal to 
run the steel division in an economic way bittman said in an 
interview thursday 
navistar has already reached a 148 million outofcourt 
settlement with 2700 former employees of the steel company 
the case adjourned late thursday until monday

chrysler corp skilled trades workers rejected a 
united auto workers contract that was ratified despite their vote 
and union officials scheduled a meeting to determine the reason for 
the rejection 
the twoyear contract covering 66000 hourly and salaried 
workers was ratified wednesday by 54 percent of those voting but 
skilled trades workers more than 10500 of chryslers uaw 
employees voted against ratification 
the skilled trades rejection has no effect on the overall 
ratification but could lead to new negotiations solely on skilled 
trades issues 
the problem is that skilled trades workers like salaried 
workers are covered both by the main contract and by a separate 
pact the deals only with skilled trades issues such as 
apprenticeships 
skilled trades and salaried workers cast one vote each that 
covers both pacts 
so at a meeting in chicago today called by uaw president owen 
bieber and uaw vice president marc stepp union leaders must 
determine whether the skilled trades rejection was based on issues 
in the main pact such as economics or issues in their separate 
contract 
the agreement has been accepted despite the skilled trades 
rejection and we are going to review the skilled trades 
situation according to our procedures uaw spokesman frank joyce 
said thursday 
if the rejection was based on issues contained in the main 
contract then neither new negotiations nor a new skilled trades 
vote will occur union sources said 
union officials who asked not to be identified said they 
believed the rejection was economic that means the meeting would 
be the only action on the rejection and skilled trades workers will 
have to live with the contract 
the meeting includes those delegates on the uaws 140member 
national chrysler council who represent skilled trades workers 
there is at least one skilled trades delegate for each of 
chryslers nearly 50 uaw local unions

a state official said 900 workers will 
be laid off from the general electric ordnance systems plant here 
over the next 18 months because of cutbacks in defense contracts 
but a company executive defense systems division vice president 
arthur glenn said ge has not yet decided how many workers will be 
laid off or when although he predicted a significant number of 
layoffs was coming because of forecasts of a troubled future 
the market we serve we thought up to a year ago to be at 
least on a sustaining basis and somewhat of a growth basis said 
glenn blaming the sudden turnaround on anticipated government 
cutbacks 
as pressure gets tough on defense budgets government 
customers have to make difficult decisions he said at a news 
conference in a ge building 
a dukakis administration official who asked not to be identified 
said ge executives had told the state 900 workers would be fired 
beginning in july because of an expected decrease in 
defenserelated orders 
the surprise announcement by the largest employer in this city 
of 52000 people came only three months after ge had promised 
stable employment at the pittsfield businesses this year 
the company had laid off more than 1000 workers last year when 
it closed its transformer plant because of losses in the highly 
competitive market 
the ordnance systems division which employs 4700 of the 6700 
employees at the ge operations in pittsfield makes guidance 
systems for trident ii ballistic missiles systems components of 
the bradley fighting machine which carries infantrymen various 
highspeed guns and other military products 
neither managers nor union officials answered their telephones 
thursday afternoon 
ge employs the same number of workers in its pittsfield defense 
systems and plastics plants as it did in 1983 when the company 
began expanding the ordnance systems division with 1400 new 
employees it announced the shutdown of the transformer 
manufacturing plant in november 1986 after months of rumors about 
the closing

black cats ladders and cracked mirrors 
move over the fridaythe13th superstition of the 1980s is 
computer viruses say some computer experts 
computer viruses are devious programs created by computer 
whizzes that infect the computers hardware and reproduce 
themselves onto other software once confined to flashing a 
harmless message on private terminals they have been known to 
erase sensitive files 
yet some programmers say they dont believe in computer viruses 
im not that superstitious and i really dont see any problems 
knock on wood said jim gogan research and development 
director at the microcomputing support center for the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill we are about as secure as things 
can get 
viruses are like the bogyman said byron c howes a 
computer systems manager at the unc educational computing service 
he compared programmers who believe in them to people who set 
little bowls of milk outside our doors to feed the dwarfs 
according to published reports viruses have infected computers 
at the national aeronautics and space administration ibm the us 
house of representatives universities and computer networks in 
businesses overseas 
last year hundreds of computers in israel were hit with a 
time bomb virus designed to activate today the virus which 
was detected and believed to have been wiped out would have spread 
and destroyed all data in any computer it had infected 
i just think that the whole thing is a joke said barry b 
cooper owner of commercial software in raleigh 
virus rumors he said were like the prediction by medieval seer 
nostradamus of a major earthquake on may 8 1988 
that didnt come true and this wont come true he said 
he and others said they were unconcerned because they inspect 
new software before using it some programmers have vaccine 
programs that alert them to someone trying to break into the system 
or other tampering cooper said

dow chemical co will halt use of 
ozonedamaging fully halogenated chlorofluorocarbons in its 
styrofoam building insulation by next year a spokesman said today 
dow will substitute nonfully halogenated cfcs for the fully 
halogenated cfcs linked in studies with damage to the worlds ozone 
layer spokesman steve reiher said 
the ozone layer of the atmosphere about 15 miles above the 
ground helps protect the earth from harmful rays of the sun 
the fully halogenated cfcs also are used in some dow packaging 
and industrial foams and substitutes also will be sought for the 
manufacture of those materials reiher said 
we dont have a substitute that is as far along as we do in 
the styrofoam so we cant give a timetable reiher said but he 
added that the company is giving top priority to finding 
alternatives 
styrofoam is a brand name for dows blue sheet insulation for 
buildings and though the name often is used for other products 
such as plastic foam cups or food packaging dow does not 
manufacture those he said 
dow purchases the cfcs used in its insulation and other products 
from various producers reiher said 
so we are also depending on dupont and pennwalt and the other 
cfc producers to come up with and produce these alternatives he 
said

many analysts who are bullish on the 
stockmarket outlook right now base their optimism on a common 
central theme that their peers are wrong about inflation 
fears of a resurgence of inflation have been spreading in the 
financial world since early this year when it become apparent that 
the economy was not slowing significantly in the wake of the stock 
market crash last fall 
alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve board has 
spoken of the need to be watchful for signs of revived upward 
pressures on prices 
bond traders have registered their uneasiness by pushing the 
yield on longterm treasury bonds up from about 8 percent to 
nearly 9 percent over the past several weeks 
one of the big concerns is that economic growth may soon strain 
the capacity both of production facilities and the available supply 
of workers so that businesses costs will start to rise at an 
accelerating pace 
those worries intensified when the labor department reported 
that the unemployment rate fell to a 14year low of 54 percent in 
april 
hardly anybody is talking about a return to the doubledigit 
annual increases in the cost of living that bedeviled the economy 
in the 1970s and early 1980s 
even a moderate increase in inflation however could create big 
problems for stocks by prompting the federal reserve to tighten 
credit and interest rates to rise in the credit markets 
that in turn could pose the threat of an eventual recession 
and prompt investors to shun stocks in favor of alternatives such 
as interestbearing money market investments 
the problem with this bynowfamiliar refrain says charles 
laloggia a rochester ny investment adviser is that it is out 
of tune with other trends taking place in the financial world 
commodity prices are not rising sharply gold which laloggia 
describes as the financial market equivalent of an inflation 
weather vane has been going nowhere lately 
in addition laloggia believes tax reform will work as a 
counterinflationary force with its removal of such things as the 
incentive for consumers to spend using borrowed money 
i seriously doubt that inflation will reach levels sufficient 
to touch off a major rise in interest rates he concludes 
argues john rutledge a claremont calif economist the 
research we have done suggests that the tightcapacity argument for 
inflation is a yawner 
for example in last years labor market wages in the tight 
capacity sectors of the economy paper chemicals and steel rose 
less than average wage rates 
it seems that there is still a sizable army of workers who 
lost their jobs to restructuring over the past five years but still 
want to work at current wage rates 
if inflation is indeed sneaking up on the economy most analysts 
agree it would spell trouble for both the stock and bond markets 
there might have been times in the past observers acknowledge 
when a little bit of inflation was no problem or maybe even a 
plus for stocks 
but these days they say real interest rates in other 
words nominal interest rates as compared to the inflation rate 
remain at stubbornly high levels and the bond market is 
hypersensitive to any change in the inflation outlook 
if interest rates move up from their current levels they could 
quickly put a damper on both the stock market and the economy 
this same hypersensitivity suggests however that if inflation 
fears prove to be unfounded interest rates could fall 
substantially 
one of the surest ways to make money in the financial markets 
is to identify a consensus and to bet against it laloggia 
maintains and right now we have a beauty of a consensus which i 
believe will turn out to be incorrect

sunbelt savings association of texas apparently 
posted a 12 billion net loss last quarter leaving regulators to 
face what could be the most expensive bailout in savings and loan 
history a published report said today 
the loss for the fiscal fourth quarter ended march 31 would be 
among the largest quarterly shortfalls ever for a thrift and 
leaves sunbelt with negative regulatory capital a lenient measure 
of net worth of almost 17 billion the wall street journal 
reported in friday editions 
the cost of closing sunbelt could rival last novembers record 
13 billion bailout of vernon savings amp loan association another 
texas thrift regulators have speculated that sunbelt however 
could be merged with other troubled texas thrifts and recapitalized 
with a combination of private capital and federal assistance 
the southwest plan a blueprint developed by federal 
regulators for rebuilding texas ailing thrift industry was 
expected to be announced this week the strategy calls for 
combining healthy institutions with about 140 ailing texas thrifts 
including 104 declared insolvent 
on wednesday the federal home loan bank board reported that the 
thrifts had capital losses of 33 billion in the quarter ended 
march 31 including the 24 billion loss in march regulators said 
one texas thrift caused much of the hit to capital but they 
refused to identify the thrift 
thomas j wageman sunbelts chairman and chief executive 
officer told the wall street journal the thrift is closely held 
and does not report its numbers publicly 
wagemans secretary told the associated press he was not 
available for further comment fhlbdallas officials did not 
immediately return the aps calls 
wageman told the journal new accounting rules imposed by federal 
regulators have hurt all savings and loans because the thrifts are 
less flexible in deferring possible losses on foreclosed property 
from the point of view of balance sheets its a revolution in 
the industry he said 
experts though said the new accounting rules dont fully 
explain sunbelts loss and cited declining texas real estate 
values as a factor 
for the nine months ended dec 31 sunbelt had a net loss of 
4062 million giving the thrift an indicated loss for the year of 
about 16 billion sunbelt had 33 billion in assets as of dec 
31 
wageman a former banker who came to sunbelt in 1986 has been a 
critic of texas savings and loan lending practices he was 
installed at sunbelt after h joe selby a former federal bank 
regulator who had worked with him took over thrift supervision at 
the federal home loan bank of dallas 
sunbelt meanwhile lost a 629 millionplus suit filed by one 
of the thrifts borrowers after sunbelt foreclosed on the 
borrowers real estate loans dallas county court records show 
a dallas jury decided the case tuesday against sunbelt but the 
court has not issued a formal judgment and neither the developers 
the lenders nor either sides attorneys would comment about the 
case 
the amount of damages will be decided by a state district judge 
after a hearing 
tf stoneliberty land associates the former owners of the 
liberty plaza ii office buildings and 42 acres of land in north 
dallas said in their lawsuit that sunbelt wrongfully foreclosed 
the properties in august 1987 
the partnership led by tommy f stone said in its suit that 
sunbelt used its financial leverage to force the partnership into 
unwanted deals then foreclosed to acquire the property 
the suit asked for the return of the foreclosed building and 
land cancellation of the loans and up to 629 million in damages

wholesale costs rose a moderate 04 percent in april while 
business sales and inventories moved in opposite directions in the 
previous month the government reported today 
the labor department said the steepest energy price gain in 15 
months pushed wholesale costs upward while food prices were 
modestly higher 
if the april increase held for 12 straight months inflation at 
the wholesale level would register an annual increase of 46 
percent more than double the 22 percent 1987 wholesale price rise 
the april increase coming after a 06 percent gain in march 
the sharpest rise in almost a year seems certain to add to 
concerns that inflation is reheating 
but the combination of booming sales and a slowdown in the 
buildup of inventories was considered good news for the economy 
pointing to expected increases in production in the months ahead 
the commerce department said business sales shot up 19 percent 
in march the biggest advance in more than a year while business 
inventories rose 03 percent the smallest gain in seven months 
separately on thursday an early easter bad weather and a 
bigger federal tax bite for some people combined to push retail 
sales down 06 percent in april but economists were unfazed by the 
decline which was the first setback in six months 
in other economic news the stock market was little changed and 
bond prices edged slightly lower amid increasing inflation worries 
the commerce department reported that consumers spent a 
seasonally adjusted 1316 billion at retail stores last month a 
drop of 815 million from the revised march figure 
sales had not fallen since a 08 percent setback last october 
but economists said they were not particularly concerned by the 
weakness especially because sales in march were revised upward to 
show an increase of 17 percent the march rise was the fastest 
sales advance since last august and almost twice the originally 
estimated 08 percent gain for the month 
retail sales are regarded as an important indicator of economic 
activity as consumer spending accounts for about twothirds of the 
gross national product 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials down 
3780 on wednesday recovered 215 points to 196800 in light 
trading 
brokers said traders continued to be concerned that persistent 
strength in the economy would lead to upward pressure on interest 
rates and inflation 
in the credit markets the price of the governments 30year 
issue fell pushing its yield to 922 percent from 920 percent 
late wednesday those yields are the highest since middecember 
separately the dollar finished slightly lower against most 
major currencies in dull domestic dealings oil prices edged 
slightly lower and soybean futures closed sharply lower after a 
fiveday rally

most grain and soybean futures opened slightly 
lower today on the chicago board of trade as slack export demand 
and forecasts for weekend rains lent a bearish tone to the markets 
weather continues to be the dominant market factor as the winter 
wheat crop nears maturity and the growing season begins in earnest 
for corn and soybeans 
market analysts predicted a fairly quiet session citing 
traders reluctance to go out on a limb by establishing new 
positions before the weekend 
just because of uncertainty about the weather forecast i 
think people will stand aside and then pick it up again after the 
weekend said joel karlin an analyst in chicago with research 
department inc 
in early trading wheat was cent to cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 301 a bushel corn was unchanged

citing possible safety problems federal 
regulators have ordered 38 nuclear power plants to inspect and if 
necessary replace piping materials for which the supplier 
allegedly falsified test reports 
some of the suspect flanges and fittings are used in 
safetyrelated systems whose failure could thwart the shutdown of 
a reactor in an emergency said edward baker a section chief in 
the nuclear regulatory commissions office of reactor regulation 
the fact that the plants are listed doesnt necessarily mean 
that the materials are not good what it means is because of facts 
we have found the materials are suspect baker said by telephone 
thursday from bethesda md 
baker said inspecting and replacing the suspect materials could 
pose some difficulty for operating plants where the materials 
could be in highradiation areas plants generally must complete 
the inspections and make replacements during their next refueling 
outages 
in a bulletin sent to the plants this week the nrc said the 
suspect piping came from piping supplies inc of folsom nj and 
west jersey manufacturing co of williamstown nj piping supplied 
since 1976 is covered by the bulletin 
west jersey and piping supplies claimed in test reports that the 
piping met standards set by the american society of mechanical 
engineers but in many cases could not provide supporting 
documentation baker said some piping material was traced to a 
foreign company which required additional tests that were not 
done he said 
a man with ties to both companies joseph walker sr today 
denied that piping supplies falsified any information but 
acknowledged that west jerseys reports were falsified he said he 
brought that information to the nrcs attention 
at no time did piping supplies knowingly use false information 
about materials supplied to the nuclear industry the company 
said this week in a letter to nrc officials and nuclear plant 
quality assurance managers 
the documents that the bulletin is referring to were obtained 
from west jersey manufacturing as a result of voluntary 
disclosure none of this material was purchased by piping 
supplies 
walker who was west jerseys president said west jersey closed 
in december 1986 after he and other top officials were indicted on 
mail fraud and tax fraud charges walker said his son joseph 
walker jr helped open piping supplies the following month 
the senior walker said he pleaded guilty to the charges paid 
more than 400000 in fines and served probation he said the 
indictments were among at least 200 handed down nationwide in 
investigations of widespread commercial kickbacks in the power 
piping industry

the government has joined in a lawsuit 
alleging that mcdonnell douglas corp overcharged the army by up to 
175 million for the apache attack helicopter 
a company spokesman on friday denied any wrongdoing 
the decision by the us justice department to join an updated 
version of the suit filed by whistleblower rod stillwell was 
contained in a us district court filing april 28 but never 
formally announced 
the department had previously joined stillwell in accusing the 
defense contractor of 11 million in overcharges on one 
subcontract for the apache which is the armys newest antitank 
and antiarmor attack helicopter 
the latest filing in the yearold suit means the government also 
supports new allegations by stillwell that the company engaged in a 
pattern of overcharging on the program 
the company hasnt been served with the latest legal paperwork 
but denies there was any overcharging said jim ramsey spokesman 
for mcdonnell douglas helicopter co a subsidiary with 
headquarters in mesa ariz 
we continue to believe the allegations in the case are without 
merit and we continue to cooperate with the government in a review 
of these matters ramsey said friday 
stillwell first made his allegations in 1984 when he was a 
subcontracts administrator at hughes helicopters inc which has 
since been bought by st louisbased mcdonnell douglas he filed 
the original suit in march 1987 
the suit was brought under the us false claims act which 
allows a court to award the government treble damages depending on 
which legal theory is applied that could amount to between 500 
million and 750 million the suit says 
under the act which is intended to encourage employees to point 
out fraud stillwell could get up to 25 percent of any damages 
awarded 
stillwells attorney william ramsey alleged that the 
overcharges represented an effort by the company to buy into 
the apache program by keeping costs artificially low early in the 
program 
they figured they could make it back later on said ramsey 
no relation to the mcdonnell douglas spokesman

atlantas banking community acting to counter 
reports of racial bias in its lending practices on friday 
announced a series of programs to provide 65 million in 
lowinterest lowcost loans to low and moderateincome borrowers 
on the citys predominantly black south side 
although denying that racial bias has played a part in lending 
decisions d raymond riddle president of first atlanta corp 
said in racial matters atlanta is like caesars wife it must 
be above suspicion 
also one of the organizers said he hoped the programs will 
forestall federal investigators 
us justice department officials have said they will look into 
the allegations of racial bias but james c mynatt spokesman for 
the newly created loan pool said he hoped an investigation would 
not now be needed 
bankers said the loan project which includes subsidies for 
police officers to live in the target neighborhoods is the first 
of its kind in the nation 
included in the programs are promises to extend banking hours in 
the targeted neighborhoods and to aggressively market the 
availability of the money 
the decisions some of which bankers said had been in the works 
for about a year were applauded by atlanta politicians who had 
been angered by newspaper reports suggesting area lending 
institutions included racial considerations in making loan 
decisions 
fulton county commission chairman michael lomax who is black 
praised the nine banks and savings and loans that stepped forward 
aggressively and met the challenge that the problem has provided to 
the community 
this is the atlanta tradition at work black and white public 
and private this problem has been transformed into an opportunity 
whats been done here today is an important first step said 
lomax whose own problems getting a home improvement loan were 
detailed in news articles 
the reports in the atlanta journal and the atlanta constitution 
indicated that white neighborhoods receive five times as many home 
loans as black neighborhoods with the same income level 
race relations in our city not only set the standard for the 
south but for the united states and the entire free world 
riddle said at a news conference announcing the lending programs 
and indeed the banks here have set standards that are 
worldwide standards in race relations as well as industry 
standards in profitability and soundness he said 
the programs include 
a 20 million loan pool from nine banks and savings 
institutions with low interest rates in targeted workingclass 
neighborhoods the pool will be managed by the newly created 
atlanta mortgage consortium 
the pool would make 30year fixedrate loans for 97 percent of 
appraised value with no private mortgage insurance required 
interest rates would be from half a point to 1 points below market 
rates with no discount points charged 
a 25 million commitment for lowinterest loans from citizens 
and southern national bank to include 10 million for homepurchase 
loans and 15 million for homeimprovement loans at low interest 
rates and low closing costs to families with incomes of 35000 or 
less 
a 10 million commitment for lowinterest loans from first 
national bank of atlanta at low interest rates and low closing 
costs for homepurchase and homeimprovement loans to families 
with incomes of 30000 or less in specific workingclass 
neighborhoods 
a similar 10 million program from trust company bank which 
also is making the largest commitment to the loan pool 
the programs include lower loan costs and more flexible 
qualifying procedures 
bankers said they would work with attorneys and others involved 
in the loan process to attempt to hold down those costs as well to 
make entry into the market easier 
in addition first atlanta and camps each announced plans to set 
aside up to 15000 a year for the ext five years to help subsidize 
housing costs for police officers who choose to live in specified 
areas joe patterson a spokesman for first atlanta said the banks 
would adopt specific neighborhoods and pay up to 200 per month to 
encourage police officers and their families to live in the areas 
the consortium will consider a similar program mynatt said 
other participating lenders include bank south na citizens 
trust bank first american bank of georgia first union national 
bank of georgia fulton federal savings and loan association and 
georgia federal bank 
the banks will begin taking applications for the new loans may

sales by american motors corp a year ago and a 55 percent increase 
in minivan sales 
chrysler held 57 percent of the minivan market in april said 
chrysler spokesman baron bates 
bates and chryslers director of sales operations planning 
steve torok attributed the increase in jeep sales to increased 
production and greater consumer confidence in jeep since chrysler 
bought amc in august 
for ford motor co the no 2 maker combined car and truck 
sales were up 315 percent and set a company record for the period 
fords truck sales also passed gms and set a separate company 
record for the period said ray windecker a ford company analyst 
the big three extended their incentive programs after may 11 but 
reduced the numbers of models covered in some cases and cut the 
size of rebates on many vehicles because inventories of unsold 
vehicles have been cleared out 
incentives are a way of life at the moment the only question 
are they big ones or small ones healy said 
gms domesticmade car sales rose 364 percent fords were up 
305 percent and chryslers rose 448 percent from a year ago gm 
light truck sales increased 321 percent fords rose 329 percent 
and chryslers jumped 531 percent 
nissan motor corp mazda motor corp honda motor co and toyota 
motor corp all also reported increased sales of usmade cars 
and for nissan light trucks 
volkswagen of america inc which is closing its westmoreland 
pa factory in july has begun phasing down production there 
leading to a decline in its domesticcar sales 
automakers have boosted their 1988 industry forecasts from 
rather pessimistic projections issued in the fall after the oct 19 
stock market crash ford for example has increased its industry 
forecast from 15 million cars and trucks imported and domestic to 
153 million 
but cedergren predicted sales will slow during the second half 
of the year and said big three production plans show a similar 
expectation by the companies 
the manufacturers are not assuming that sales are going to 
stay at the same high rate as they were the first quarter he 
said

the boeing co is being called the big winner in 
an order for more than 4 billion worth of aircraft and industry 
analysts say they arent surprised 
the wall street journal quoting unnamed sources reported 
friday that international lease finance corp is expected to 
announce monday that boeing has won 80 percent of the order for up 
to 120 planes and that the european consortium airbus industrie 
will get the rest 
ilfc vice president kenneth taylor said in a telephone interview 
today that he knew news of a decision had leaked out but he said 
no formal announcement would be made by the company until monday 
morning 
he said company president steven udvarhazy was in seattle to 
pick up a previously ordered 747 at boeings everett plant the 
companys fourth 
ilfc based in beverly hills calif recently announced it 
intended to buy as many as 120 planes including options in a 
combination of medium and longrange aircraft the companys board 
reportedly met tuesday to decide which companies would get the 
order 
tom cole spokesman for boeing commercial airplanes in seattle 
said the company didnt have details of the order yet and wouldnt 
say anything until international does david venz airbus us 
spokesman in herndon va said the same thing 
but judith comeau of goldman sachs in new york said friday that 
suppliers had received the orders already 
i dont know why theyre waiting so long to announce it she 
said of international lease 
ms comeau said she was quite sure four companies would get a 
piece of the action boeing and airbus for the aircraft and 
general electric and pratt amp whitney for engines and that she 
wouldnt be surprised if boeing got most of it 
according to international lease finance they wanted a full 
range of aircraft including the 747 she said no other 
aircraft can take that many passengers in terms of volume boeing 
obviously has the largest capacity and would be in a better 
position to bid this contract 
also international finance corp leases its aircraft to 
airlines and its easier to maintain aircraft with some 
commonality boeing already has a large share of the market 
george shapiro of salomon bros in new york agreed 
ive kind of expected boeing would be the winner he said 
if youre leasing airplanes to airliners youre best off 
using the most known and most familiar boeing has a dominant 
market share 
a spokesman for st louisbased mcdonnell douglas corp told the 
wall street journal that the company never seriously considered 
itself a candidate for the order 
the planes would meet ilfcs fleet needs between 1991 and 1995 
udvarhazy has said the companys biggest previous order was last 
years 19plane purchase of several boeing models worth 115 
billion 
udvarhazy earlier indicated the coming order would be for 
allboeing aircraft or a combination of airbus or mcdonnell douglas 
aircraft but he said thursday that the order had been changed to 
mix sources 
the largest aircraft order to date is thought to be british 
airways 23 billion purchase of 16 boeing 747s in 1986 which 
would have a value of 41 billion if 12 options for other jumbo 
jets are exercised

soybean futures prices skyrocketed friday and grain futures also 
advanced after the national weather service predicted a month of 
drierthannormal growing conditions 
on other markets precious metals were higher cattle futures 
rose while pork futures were mixed energy futures were slightly 
higher and stockindex futures advanced 
soybean futures which had posted strong gains in five of the 
six previous sessions leaped as much as 14 cents a bushel on the 
chicago board of trade and set new contract highs across the board 
the national weather service said in its 30day outlook that the 
ohio river valley central mississippi river valley and the 
mississippi delta region would all be drier than normal 
the large speculative firms refco inc and campd commodities led 
the trading analysts said 
they were using that forecast as an excuse to rally the 
soybean market said jon horton an analyst at research 
department inc in chicago its still a bull market so 
everyones back in it on the long side 
some private forecasters also reduced their predictions for rain 
over the weekend said mickey luth soybean analyst with shearson 
lehman hutton inc 
the soybean market is particularly sensitive to weather concerns 
because of indications that the us soybean stockpile is dwindling 
and a large crop is needed to meet expected demand 
some analysts have called the recent soybean speculation 
excessive but luth questioned that opinion 
who knows from an overall balance sheet pointofview maybe 
the soybeans should have been up here anyway he said 
wheat settled 3 cents to 4 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in may at 306 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cents 
higher with may at 197 a bushel oats were cent to 2 cents 
higher with may at 157 a bushel soybeans were 9 cents to 14 
cents higher with may at 719 a bushel 
the surge in soybean futures supported expectations for higher 
inflation which helped boost precious metals futures prices 
analysts said 
platinum futures led group which had been flagging in reaction 
to a government report issued early friday that said wholesale 
prices had risen a moderate 04 percent in april the 
inflationsensitive metals markets had expected a greater increase 
better buying emerged late in the session as soybean and some 
other markets firmed said stephen w platt an analyst in 
chicago with dean witter reynolds inc that mitigated the effects 
of the producer price index for april and tended to fuel 
inflationary expectations that have been building recently 
platinum settled 670 to 720 higher on the new york 
mercantile exchange with july at 55030 a troy ounce 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold settled 150 lower 
to 40 cents higher with june at 45370 a troy ounce silver was 
48 cents to 58 cents higher with may at 6632 a troy ounce 
cattle futures gained due to strong cash prices while pork 
futures finished mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange 
advances in the cattle pit were limited by positionevening 
ahead of mondays sevenstate cattleonfeed report which is 
expected to show fewer feedlot placements during april compared to 
last year and a nearly equal number of april marketings analysts 
said 
support for the hog and pork belly contracts stemmed from 
expectations that cash markets will remain firm as hog slaughters 
experience a seasonal decline said philip stanley an analyst in 
chicago with thomson mckinnon securities inc 
live cattle settled 15 cent to 65 cent higher with june at 
7380 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 48 cent 
higher with may at 8077 cents a pound hogs were 13 cent lower to 
43 cent higher with june at 5355 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 35 cent lower to 38 cent higher with may at 5440 
cents a pound 
most energy futures prices inched higher in lackluster trading 
on the new york mercantile exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 4 
cents higher with june at 1749 a barrel heating oil was 15 cent 
to 30 cent higher with june at 4747 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 15 cent lower to 42 cent higher with june at 5234 
cents a gallon

japans trade surplus fell to 675 billion in 
april the 12th consecutive monthly decline the finance ministry 
said friday 
the surplus in japans worldwide trade during april declined 
from 754 billion a year ago and from 746 billion in march the 
ministry said 
japans trade surplus with the united states also continued to 
fall dropping to 413 billion in april from 513 billion a year 
earlier 
ministry officials attributed the steady decline mostly to the 
rise in value of the yen which makes japanese products more 
expensive overseas and tends to make imports less costly in japan 
in the background of this trend is of course the yens 
appreciation for more than two years a ministry official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
still however surveys show that much of the savings from 
cheaper exports has not been passed on to consumers 
imports surged 31 percent from the previous years level to a 
record 1567 billion for the month while exports rose 15 percent 
to 2242 billion the ministry said 
officials said manufactured goods accounted for a record 499 
percent of imports in april surpassing the previous record of 488 
percent set in february 
officials noted an increase in imports of manufactured goods 
from newly industrialized asian countries such as taiwan and south 
korea attributing the rise to improved quality and price 
competitiveness 
the reduction in the trade imbalance with the united states was 
encouraging to the japanese government which has been under 
pressure from the united states to reduce its large trade surplus 
exports to the united states fell 12 percent from the previous 
year to 734 billion while imports shot up 397 percent to 321 
billion the ministry said 
imports of a wide range of us products increased textile 
materials surged 621 percent to 676 million while imports of 
business machines climbed 512 percent to 1589 million 
audiovideo products shot up 2881 percent to 15 million and car 
imports accelerated by 3259 percent to 347 million 
japanese trade figures are calculated on a customsclearance 
basis which includes transportation and insurance costs in imports 
but not in exports if the costs were added to both japans trade 
surplus would be higher

a joint usbritish investigation of companies 
that allegedly fail to deliver promised loans and reap fees from 
their clients prompted raids in great britain and california 
authorities said 
british and us officials said thursdays raids were among 
their largest cooperative campaigns against whitecollar crimes in 
recent years 
they said the targets were part of an alleged scheme bilking 
clients out of tens of millions of dollars a year by charging fees 
to help them get loans that are never made 
its one of the most successful loan schemes there has been 
sgt nigel lane of scotland yard told the boston globe the whole 
fraud is designed to cross boundaries to capitalize on problems of 
jurisdiction 
the globe reported six weeks ago that first boston charter corp 
in boston and other companies around the world allegedly would 
promise to help clients get lowcost loans charge them large fees 
the companies then allegedly passed the applications among 
themselves making new promises and charging more fees 
the globe said none of the clients it interviewed got the loan 
or recovered the fees paid 
shortly after the articles appeared first boston charter was 
evicted from its offices in boston and the globe said two 
executives of first boston charter were seen at one of the 
companies raided thursday in california 
thursdays actions began with simultaneous raids in london and 
lincolnshire about 130 miles north of london 
police in lincolnshire searched offices of united kingdom loans 
amp insurance services ltd and arrested its top executive lawrence 
w hill and scotland yard officers raided westminster amp london 
investments ltd in london and arrested david morgan 
lane said both were arrested on suspicion of criminal 
deception and released 
eight hours later fbi agents raided a suite of offices in 
irvine calif while others raided the offices of eurokredit na 
in newport beach calif 
the globe said the suite in irvine housed three companies zuger 
ltd charter federal ltd and mercantile general corp

wholesale prices rose a moderate 04 percent 
in april despite the biggest jump in energy prices in more than 15 
months the government said friday 
the april increase in the producer price index was down from a 
06 percent march advance leading many analysts to conclude that 
worries over inflation had been overstated by the march increase 
they said if the volatile energy and food sectors were removed 
the april price advance was a minuscule 01 percent 
it is hard to make a real scare story that inflation is taking 
off based on these kinds of numbers said david wyss an 
economist with data resources inc 
for the first four months of the year wholesale prices have 
risen at an annual rate of 29 percent not much changed from the 
22 percent increase for all of 1987 
the earlier fears that inflation was taking off were 
substantially overstated said jerry jasinowski chief economist 
of the national association of manufacturers this report 
confirms that most of the price increases we have been getting 
recently have been in oil there is no reason to believe that opec 
will be able to enforce control over oil markets enough to keep 
energy prices rising 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called the report 
good news producer price inflation remains low 
the report sparked a rally in the bond markets as investors 
concluded there will be no additional pressure on the federal 
reserve to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand 
prices of longterm government bonds rose as much as 5 for each 
1000 in face value to yield 917 percent on thursday the 
bellwether 30year issues yield jumped to its highest point this 
year at 922 percent 
the fed recently moved to make credit less available to the 
banking system because of fears the economy was overheating that 
tightening prompted the nations major banks to boost their prime 
lending rate from 85 percent to 9 percent on wednesday the first 
increase since last octobers stock market crash 
other economists however insisted that the april price report 
contained some troubling signs that price increases will be 
accelerating in the months ahead 
it would be a mistake to look at this report and say 
inflationary pressures have abated said michael evans head of a 
washington forecasting firm i dont think this relief is going 
to last 
energy prices which had posted sharp declines from september 
through february accounted for half of the increase in the overall 
index in april rising 31 percent the biggest jump since a 32 
percent rise in january 1987 
gasoline costs advanced 07 percent while home heating oil shot 
up 52 percent natural gas which had declined in price in five of 
the last six months rose 43 percent 
analysts blamed the price pressures on rising world crude oil 
prices in late april but since that time oil prices have 
retreated somewhat leading some economists to predict the april 
price surge will be temporary 
food costs rose 04 percent in april down from a 07 percent 
march increase as a sharp 163 percent drop in the price of eggs 
and smaller declines in the price of fruit fish and beef offset 
price increases for pork chicken vegetables and coffee 
the financial markets took the economic news in stride on wall 
street the dow jones industrial average climbed 2255 points to 
close at 199055 
brokers noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in the 
producer price index and instead drew inspiration from falling 
interest rates and a steady dollar 
the dollar finished slightly higher in domestic dealings but 
fell against the british pound which has been gaining ground 
despite central bank intervention to stem its rise 
in another economic report friday the government said total 
business sales surged 19 percent in march the biggest advance in 
more than a year while business inventories were up a modest 03 
percent 
analysts said the combination of rising sales and small declines 
in inventories should translate into continued strong industrial 
production in the months ahead 
the labor department gave these additional details on its ppi 
report for april 
new car prices fell 05 percent in april a big turnaround from 
a 10 percent increase in march 
capital equipment costs were up a moderate 02 percent half 
the increase of the previous month 
childrens clothing prices gained 06 percent while mens 
clothing costs gained 01 percent the same as the gain recorded 
for womens apparel 
the april increase brought the overall wholesale price index to 
1069 this means a selection of wholesale goods costing 100 
during a 1982 base period would have cost 10690 last month this 
index itself is not adjusted for seasonal variations as are other 
figures in the report

intervention against the pounds rise that sentiment was 
reinforced by prime minister margaret thatchers apparent continued 
opposition to massive intervention in the foreignexchange markets 
the market feels safe pushing for higher sterling said 
nigel green an assistant director at ebcamro bank in london 
they feel free from intervention

the federal government is investigating 
whether real estate company edward j debartolo corp may have 
violated federal securities laws related to corporate takeover 
bids according to documents released friday 
the securities and exchange commission said it has information 
suggesting that paul a bilzerian chairman of singer co may have 
entered into illegal arrangements with certain brokerdealers to 
purchase stock in carter hawley hale stores cluett peabody amp co 
hammermill paper co and other publicly owned companies 
the sec also said documents suggest that edward j bartolo sr 
head of youngstown ohiobased debartolo corp may have entered 
into undisclosed arrangements with bilzerian with regard to the 
acquisition of cluett and hammermill securities 
these documents suggest that among other things debartolo 
sr may have loaned millions of dollars to bilzerian to employees 
of ejdc debartolo corp and to relatives of debartolo sr to be 
used by them to purchase hammermill and cluett securities the 
sec said 
the agency also said the documents suggest that bilzerian and 
debartolo sr may have entered into an undisclosed profitsharing 
arrangement regarding cluett securities 
bilzerian launched unsuccessful takeover bids for cluett peabody 
in 1985 and hammermill in 1986 and made millions in stock profits 
and reimbursed expenses when he was outbid 
a spokeswoman for debartolo corp referred calls to stephen 
flood debartolos attorney several calls to flood went unreturned 
we have no comment said ted levine a partner at wilmer 
cutler amp pickering a law firm representing bilzerian 
the secs assertions were contained in documents filed in us 
district court last month as part of a bid to compel the senior 
debartolo edward j debartolo jr and other debartolo corp 
officers to comply with subpoenas seeking brokerage account 
information and records of contacts with bilzerian 
federal law requires investors to disclose holdings in a 
takeover target within 10 days of the time they exceed 5 percent of 
the target companys shares it also requires the disclosure of 
anyone else acting in concert with the investor 
disclosure of a 5 percent stake alerts the investment community 
and often sends a stock price up in anticipation of a highpriced 
takeover bid 
bilzerian did not disclose any loans from or arrangements with 
debartolo sr in his filings with the sec on stock holdings in 
cluett or hammermill the agency said 
the sec investigation is part of a wideranging probe of 
socalled stock parking 
stock parking is an arrangement whereby one person sells 
securities to another with the understanding they will be held and 
later sold back the sec said it is frequently used as a vehicle to 
conceal a beneficial ownership of securities and to evade 
disclosure requirements 
herbert janick an attorney in the secs division of 
enforcement said in a declaration filed with the court that 
several documents on their face reflect that debartolo sr 
purchased cluett and hammermill securities in his own name and 
loaned funds to relatives bilzerian and debartolo corp employees 
to buy the securities 
janick also said a page of handwritten notes suggests that 
debartolo sr and bilzerian entered into a profitsharing 
arrangement concerning cluett securities and indicates that the two 
men discussed a purchasing strategy 
in addition to shopping centers and other real estate debartolo 
owns the san francisco 49ers football team and the pittsburgh 
penguins hockey team

government forecasters again have lowered 
their prediction of oil prices and sharply raised their 
expectations for imports this year 
in the quarterly publication short term energy outlook 
analysts of the energy information administration said crude prices 
for the rest of this year and next should run 15 to 18 a barrel 
a reduction of 1 to 2 from their january predictions 
the average for this year should be about 16 as opposed to 
1730 predicted in january the forecasters said in the april 
edition made available friday 
lanwhile imports of crude should rise 11 percent compared with 
last year from 457 million barrels per day to 506 million 
barrels the forecasters said in january the eia a 
semiindependent arm of the energy department predicted that crude 
imports for 1988 would rise 26 percent to 471 million barrels per 
day 
counting refined products net petroleum imports this year 
should increase 87 percent from 577 million barrels per day to 
627 million barrels the january prediction was for a 41 percent 
increase to 604 million barrels per day 
overall petroleum use should rise 18 percent this year from 
1655 milion barrels per day to 685 million barrels the 
forecasters said earlier they had predicted a 08 percent 
increase to 1666 million barrels that would mean the import share 
of the market would rise from 35 percent to 37 percent instead of 
36 percent 
much of the predicted increase in consumption already has 
occurred as a result of colderthannormal temperatures in january 
and february and as higherthanexpected demand by the chemical 
industry 
the revisions in forecasts included a boost in expected gross 
national product this year adjusted for inflation of 22 percent 
over last year januarys outlook envisioned a 18 percent 
increase 
similar upward revisions were made in several categories in the 
january forecasts as it became clear that the october stock market 
crash did not mean a slowdown in economic activity

to the surprise and dismay of many 
bankers and economists the brazilian congress has voted to limit 
interest rates to 12 percent annually under the nations new 
constitution 
the 559member congress sitting as a constituent assembly to 
rewrite the constitution approved the measure wednesday night 
despite protests by economic experts that the limit was unworkable 
the article says banks may not charge on any financial operation 
more than 12 percent a year plus monetary correction for 
inflation which this year is estimated will reach 600 percent 
banks now charge as much as 100 percent a year interest in addition 
to monetary correction 
the congress also voted to bar banks from activities outside the 
financial market such as selling insurance or operating travel 
agencies 
the measure drew sharp criticism from government officials and 
the financial community 
finance minister mailson da nobrega said he was stupefied by 
the legislators decision 
rep antonio delfim netto a former finance minister who voted 
against the measure told his colleagues on the congressional 
floor if we cant control the price of a can of sardines why do 
we have the pretension to control interest rates 
former central bank president fernao bracher called the measure 
generous but extremely harmful he predicted the interest 
ceiling would lead to a consumer spending boom hyperinflation and 
capital flight 
the author of the amendment rep fernando gasparian a wealthy 
farmer and businessman told the newspaper jornal do brasil of rio 
my amendment is neither poetic nor leftist the banks are digging 
into everyones pocket and because of this many farmers are 
going under

authoritarian document handed down in 1969 by a military regime 
that ruled from 1964 to 1985 the new constitution is expected to 
be ready late this year

a federal appeals court heard arguments 
friday on a temporary injunction suspending a 17 billion hostile 
takeover attempt of koppers co by british industrialist brian 
beazer and the investment firm shearson lehman hutton inc 
after hearing both sides of the issue the threejudge panel of 
the us 9th circuit court of appeal will rule later whether us 
district court judge manuel real in los angeles was correct to 
order the injunction in april because of antitrust questions 
the injunction effectively put on hold a 60pershare hostile 
tender offer for the pittsburghbased koppers by the beazer group 
the offer has been extended weektoweek and now has a may 18 
deadline 
koppers contends that competition could be weakened in the 
southern california aggregate market for sand gravel and hard 
stone for construction if properties owned there by koppers and 
beazer are combined 
attorney john bodner jr said appointment of a trustee to 
oversee the aggregate portion of the company while competition and 
other questions are resolved would be very difficult if not 
impossible 
while koppers has an aggregate facility in irwindale he said 
most of the personnel connected with it work in long beach 
pittsburgh or other kopper offices 
bodner also said that koppers is involved in high secret 
sensitive negotiations relating to increasing its reserves of 
sand gravel and hard stone and the beazer group has a similar 
business almost as big as koppers he said 
the competitors would love to know what were up to he 
said predicting that if the takeover was allowed some employees 
would feel obligated to discuss those matters with the new owners 
they will learn it the instant they acquire us bodner said 
mark leddy an attorney representing the beazer group called 
the injunction extraordinary and unprecedented and said it 
should be thrown out
