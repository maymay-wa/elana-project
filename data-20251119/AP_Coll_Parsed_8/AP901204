columbias astronauts got a balky 
observatory running tuesday but missed important targets and had 
to revert to manual operations when the startracking system failed 
to work automatically 
astronaut jeffrey hoffman did manage to spot the soviet mir 
space station through binoculars and said it appeared as a small 
point of light mir was orbiting with five men 32 miles above 
columbia which is 218 miles above earth 
mission specialist mike lounge saw the spacecraft on the next 
orbit when mir was closer horizontally the two spacecrafts came 
within about 44 miles of each other tuesday 
its extremely frustrating arthur davidsen of johns hopkins 
university said of the latest problems 
weve got this wonderful instrument ready to go and were not 
getting it pointed at any scientific targets except for brief 
glimpses brief enough to show how great it would be once it locks 
on but not long enough to get the science we want to get said 
davidsen principal investigator for one of the observatorys three 
ultraviolet telescopes 
earlier tuesday nasa officials said the 150 million astro 
observatory aboard the shuttle had been repaired but needed more 
adjustments the instrument pointing system is not expected to be 
100 percent for another few days said mission scientist ted 
gull 
were really in a stage where the observatory is starting to 
come alive gull said its a lot later than where we wanted to 
be but i see no major showstoppers 
more than 10 percent of the approximately 230 telescope 
pointings was expected to be lost because of the interruptions in 
astros roundtheclock observing astro was supposed to study 
about 250 highenergy objects including galaxies quasars a 
supernova and a comet 
astronomers braced for the worst began the painful process of 
removing lowpriority targets from the viewing lineup because of 
the malfunctions that delayed the 10day missions stargazing 
there was no guarantee however that even the most important 
objects would be studied in depth 
the johns hopkins telescope for example missed two chances 
tuesday to study binary stars in the midst of rare cataclysmic 
outbursts because of pointing system problems 
were tense about progress at the moment davidsen said 
nasa had intended to start using the astro observatory late 
sunday less than 24 hours into the flight those plans were dashed 
when the pointing systems star trackers experienced problems 
shortly after liftoff 
the trouble was almost resolved when an onboard computer 
crashed monday night sending the astronauts and ground teams 
back to square zero said mission manager jack jones it wasnt 
until tuesday morning that the crew reported all three star 
trackers seemed to be in good working order 
astronaut ron parise radioed down that the pointing system 
looks like its steady as a rock 
it doesnt mean we can find the fields but its a step in the 
right direction parise told ground controllers 
the astronauts focused astros ultraviolet telescopes on the 
nearby star capella in the constellation auriga using the pointing 
systems automatic mode but they later had to return to manual 
operations a slow awkward process when the system failed to 
lock onto a star other attempts followed both manual and 
automatic 
the xray observatory which is operated from the ground and has 
its own pointing system also focused on capella it was the first 
time the instrument had received xrays 
the instrument is performing as expected if not better said 
nasa scientist peter serlemitsos principal investigator of the 
xray telescope 
but later tuesday night an axis on the xray telescope fell out 
of alignment said nasa spokesman bob lessels ground controllers 
hoped to correct the alignment and get the telescope working again 
by early wednesday 
lessels said he did not know what caused the alignment problem 
astro is nearly five years late in studying celestial sources of 
ultraviolet light and xrays which cannot penetrate the atmosphere 
and thus are invisible from earth the mission was scheduled for 
march 1986 but was delayed by the challenger accident early that 
year 
four countdowns were halted this year because of shuttle fuel 
leaks and a telescope problem before columbia finally lifted off 
sunday a soviet soyuz rocket blasted into orbit 1 hours later 
with two cosmonauts and a japanese television reporter bound for 
space station mir 
the seven astronauts plan to contact the mir cosmonauts via ham 
radio toward the end of columbias mission parise a licensed ham 
radio operator already has communicated with his father in ohio 
and other amateur radio operators 
on a light note mission control got its first glimpse of a new 
trash compactor being used aboard the shuttle pilot guy gardner 
put in a large bag of trash pumped two handles back and forth and 
then pulled out a smashed bag 
tada gardner said displaying the compressed bag before 
middeck tv cameras 
its a little bit different from a household masher but its 
doing us a lot of good up here said columbias commander vance 
brand

it was natural comedy material but five 
highflying comics couldnt get any mileage out of it 
the comedians started entertaining continental express 
passengers during east coast flights monday the same day 
continental airlines filed for bankruptcy protection the comics 
shied away from the issue on company orders 
the comedians working the newarktonew haven conn commuter 
flights were told the news of the day and reminded to stay away 
from inappropriate material continental spokeswoman nancy compel 
said tuesday 
the promotion was hatched two months ago and will continue 
despite the bankruptcy proceedings she said 
the comedians were advised last week to keep the cabin humor 
clean and not make jokes about airplanes 
continental the nations fifthlargest airline said a 22 
billion debt and higher jet fuel costs because of the persian gulf 
crisis forced the bankruptcy move 
peter bales of northport ny one of comics performing during 
the oneweek promotion said the airlines financial troubles were 
the least of his worries 
turbulence forced the standup comedian to deliver his 10minute 
monologue sitting down 
its difficult to be funny when youre trying not to vomit 
bales said in a telephone interview tuesday 
he began by warning hecklers they would be asked to leave then 
he griped about the gig saying there were two guys with 
headphones in his dressing room 
the jokes were delivered while he was strapped into his seat he 
craned his head down the aisle to catch a glimmer of response over 
the noisy engines 
i thought at one point i got applause he said but i 
think my ears were just popping from the pressure

roald dahl the author of childrens 
tales and macabre stories dashed off a humorous poem about that 
goodfornothing knave santa claus for a group of tennessee 
schoolchildren not long before he died 
dahl whose stories including charlie and the chocolate 
factory died nov 23 at age 74 at a hospital near his home in 
oxford england 
earlier teacher dorothy hallmans fourthgrade students at 
thrasher elementary school on signal mountain sent him a package of 
poems and pictures as a class project 
in a reply dated november 1990 dahl wrote 
hello gorgeous dorothy and all the clever children at thrasher 
elementary school who wrote to me thank you so much for the lovely 
letters and wonderful drawings there is now only one more shopping 
month till christmas 
dahl then followed with a poem about christmas that took a 
characteristically skewed look at things 
 
where art thou mother christmas 
i really wish i knew 
why father shouldget all the praise 
and no one mentions you 
 
ill bet you buy all the presents 
and wrap them large and small 
while all the time the dirty swine 
pretends hes done it all 
 
so hail to mother christmas 
the uncomplaining slave 
and down with father christmas 
that goodfornothing knave

one day in 1979 bismillah kamkai was 
taken from his un development program office in kabul 
afghanistan under armed guard he was never heard from again 
belay melake an ethiopian statistician working for a un 
economic agncy in addis ababa disappeared more than 11 years ago 
his colleagues believe his government tortured and killed him 
british journalist alec collett was abducted south of beirut in 
1985 while on assignment for the united nations relief and works 
agency which aids palestinian refugees in 1986 his kidnappers 
claimed to have killed him in retaliation for the us air raid on 
libya but no body was found 
un staff members say 10 of their colleagues have been killed 
including kamkai and melake collett is among 165 listed as missing 
or detained around the world 
ninetynine of those detained are arab relief workers held by 
israeli authorities in the occupied gaza strip or west bank 
according to the un employee union 
much attention has focused on western hostages in the middle 
east but little has been paid to the scores of detained un 
employees most are lowlevel employees of relief and development 
agencies who are citizens of the countries where they work 
these people are working for the world community and its 
surprising that theres not more compassion said lori berliner 
who for a decade has led a committee of international civil 
servants pressing for the release of those detained we worry 
about staff being forgotten 
israel accuses the arab un workers it holds of subversive 
activities said lowell flanders president of the un staff 
union but he added theyre not terrorists many were 
teachers guards or drivers in palestinian refugee camps 
about 20 governments or organizations have been accused of 
killing un employees or detaining them illegally flanders 
described ethiopia as one of the most serious offenders because of 
reports the government has tortured and killed prisoners 
he said he had independent reports that ghennet mebrahtu a 
widow with two children employed by the world health organization 
in addis ababa had been tortured since her arrest in august 
an ethiopian delegate told a un committee in november that 
mrs mebrahtu was arrested for activities not consistent with 
her un duties and would be tried soon he did not elaborate 
the un staff union insists un workers be afforded due 
process open hearings written charges and the right to legal 
counsel as provided for in the 1948 universal declaration of human 
rights 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar has demanded 
repeatedly that the rights of un staff members be respected 
at a time when the organization is being called upon to 
undertake greater responsibilities in various parts of the world 
it is totally unacceptable that staff members are subjected to 
arbitrary or unexplained detention abduction or even have their 
lives placed at risk he said recently 
un committees and member states also have said the matter is 
urgent but the staff union wants action 
it has demanded a halt to all un activities except for 
humanitarian aid in any country that illegally detains un 
workers un officials and delegates say there is little chance of 
that 
mahmoud tarjouman a syrian arrested by his government in 1976 
before he could begin work for a un economic commission in 
lebanon said the united nations did not work for his release 
during nine years of imprisonment 
no un official ever contacted his wife and his salary was 
stopped after 1 years tarjouman said 
he said his support for multiparty democracy may have caused his 
arrest by president hafez assads government 
tarjouman was neither charged or tried and returned to the 
united nations after his release he now works as an editor in new 
york and un officials are considering his request for ack pay 
un workers accept that their duties involve risk flanders 
said but at the same time they expect that if they do encounter 
difficulties the organization would support them 
reasons for detentions are many 
some un workers simply were caught up in unrest among the 10 
believed slain are fernando olivaresmori and carmelo soria 
espinosa seized in the 1970s in chile under the military regime of 
gen augusto pinochet 
some may have been victims of attempts to frustrate un 
activity in 19871989 the communist government of nicolai 
ceausescu refused to let a professor working for the united nations 
leave romania to report on human rights

a tobacco industry spokeswoman defended 
cigarette manufacturers efforts to influence an environmental 
protection agency draft report concluding that secondhand smoke 
causes cancer in nonsmokers 
there has been a lot of involvement by the antismoking 
community that we dont think should be there said brennan 
dawson spokeswoman for the tobacco institute if youre going to 
pursue science it ought to be without advocacy 
an epa advisory panel today was to hear testimony from the 
industry and public health advocates as it begins reviewing the epa 
draft report 
for three years the industry and its allies in congress have 
lobbied the epa at every opportunity to soften or delay that draft 
report and two others on passive smoking 
documents obtained under the freedom of information act show 
that the industry sent the epa a mountain of technical information 
that dwarfs the epas reports and met repeatedly with epa 
scientists and administrators 
they clearly were privy to stuff that was going on that we had 
no idea about said mark pertschuk executive director of 
americans for nonsmokers rights in berkeley calif 
the epa at the industrys request twice extended the time 
allowed for outside comment on draft reports 
no one else was as active in conveying their concerns and 
interests said robert axelrad director of the epas indoor air 
division he said the agency received boxloads of material from 
the industry 
two of the three epa reports were to be considered a report 
assessing the lung cancer risks associated with passive smoking 
and a workplace policy guide on environmental smoke the risk 
assessment recommends that environmental tobacco smoke be declared 
a class a carcinogen a known cause of human cancer 
a third epa report a compendium of related technical 
information on passive smoking is being revised 
the stakes for the tobacco industry are enormous 
if secondhand smoke is officially listed as a class a 
carcinogen it is the end of smoking in any public place said 
julia carol associate director of americans for nonsmokers 
rights 
ms dawson of the tobacco institute defended the industrys 
involvement in the review process what we have tried to do is 
stay in the process and do it appropriately and through 
conversations with epa staff she said 
two republicans from the tobacco state of virginia rep thomas 
bliley and sen john warner have written to the epa expressing 
concerns shared by the industry 
bliley has repeatedly sought clarification of epa procedures and 
protested the agencys reliance on certain scientists whose work 
has found large risks associated with passive smoking 
most of the epas correspondence with industry representatives 
makes clear the industrys comments are welcome 
in a june 30 1989 letter however an epa official criticized 
the industry for its continued refusal to admit that smoking causes 
cancer and other diseases in smokers 
the industrys argument on passive smoking would be more 
credible if it were not so similar to the tobacco industrys 
position on direct smoking despite the estimated 50000 studies 
linking smoking with disease in humans wrote william rosenberg 
an epa assistant administrator 
the tobacco institute and the two largest tobacco companies 
philip morris and rj reynolds also have formed a media 
subcommittee to get their message out 
three rj reynolds scientists a company spokeswoman and an 
adviser from the public relations firm hill and knowlton have been 
on the road nearly fulltime since labor day talking to reporters 
and newspaper editorial boards about the epa reports

at last the purrfect christmas stocking 
stuffer for indoor cats who have everything its their very own 
videotape featuring a mouthwatering parade of live birds 
squirrels and chipmunks cavorting on the tv screen 
the 25minute fullcolor video taped in a wooded backyard of 
this washington suburb is sure to delight all those latchkey 
kitties who are bored with napping scratching the furniture and 
swatting ornaments off the christmas tree 
just slip a 1995 copy of video catnip into the vcr and 
watch them turn into regular couch furballs but heed the warning 
at the start of the tape 
while watching this video your cat may become excited and 
attempt to get inside your television set to get at the birds 
we strongly suggest that you remove all breakables from on top or 
around your tv set no kitting 
creator steve malarkey promises some cataclysmic fun with no 
paws in the action his satisfied customers speaking for their 
pampered pussycats say his video really delivers the goods 
the live action is divided into segments titled cheep 
thrills mews and feather report and a stalk in the park 
voyeuristic feline viewers will enjoy lots of juicy closeups of 
their favorite outdoor creatures feasting noisily on birdseed and 
popcorn 
malarkey was a disgruntled computer technician searching for a 
career change when he decided to get into the cat business he 
tried making heated cat houses and treeshaped scratching 
posts but both were flops 
then one night he said i was sitting in front of the tv with 
my wife watching a national geographic special on birds of the 
cayman islands or somewhere he said our cat stick who never 
even glanced at tv before came out of his box like a shot and sat 
right in front of the screen growling and meowing 
malarkey borrowed a friends video camera and tripod seeded his 
backyard with treats and let the tape run for an hour 
when i brought the tape back to the house and showed it to 
stick he went ballistic malarkey said he was in front of the 
tv behind the tv on top of the tv knocking things over and 
swiping at the screen 
my friend showed the tape to his cat tigger who also never 
watches tv and tigger went absolutely nuts 
bingo 
malarkey hired a professional camera crew and doused his 
backyard with 200 pounds of birdseed and popcorn it was 
springtime and things were really hopping out there he said 
by the time the crew arrived you couldnt see the ground for all 
the birds 
can cats really see a tv video 
veterinarians agree with malarkey that although cats dont 
discern shapes and colors as distinctly as humans they are acutely 
aware of moving figures and sounds that excite them 
malarkey has sold 7000 tapes since video catnip appeared on 
pet store shelves a little more than a year ago hes already 
planning sequels with bigger birds bigger squirrels maybe some 
sea gulls thrown in 
human viewers might find video catnip boring after a while 
after all whats thrilling about watching a pair of blue jays 
squabbling or a squirrel snitching a peanut from a bowl 
steven spielberg it aint said malarkey who now lives in 
morgantown wva but we havent gotten any complaints yet from 
the cats

iranian veterans of the 198088 war with 
iraq say the americans and their allies cannot expect a short 
quick war if they attack to liberate kuwait 
the iraqis can take a great number of casualties and continue 
to fight over the corpses of their dead said col amir an 
infantryman who fought in most of the major battles of the gulf 
war amir refused to be further identified 
if they want to fight the iraqis the americans are going to 
have to stomach death he said in an interview 
most iraqi soldiers have eight years of real war experience 
the young americans sent to fight have never seen a battle front 
never killed or been near death he said 
some us soldiers in the gulf fought in panama and grenada 
both quick campaigns 
by conservative western count there were 1 million casualties 
on both sides during the iraniraq war 
the war ended with a ceasefire in 1988 but peace talks dragged 
on until iraqi president saddam hussein apparently eager to pacify 
one front as multinational troops were deployed in response to his 
invasion of kuwait suddenly acceded to iranian demands 
iran has condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but it has 
been equally harsh in its criticism of the usled deployment of 
foreign soldiers to the gulf region 
the iranians hard hit by an arms embargo throughout the gulf 
war had to rely on massed infantry attacks with little armor and 
artillery and virtually no air cover 
the americans and their allies would wage a different kind of 
war pitting their firepower and electronic expertise against 
saddams numerical strength 
the united states plans to have 430000 troops in the gulf by 
january a total of about 150000 troops were sent by 27 other 
nations 
iraq has an estimated 220000 troops in kuwait and another 
230000 in southern iraq near the kuwait border saddam has said 
250000 more men will be sent to kuwait a deployment us experts 
say could take a month 
iranian deputy foreign minister ali mohammad besharati said 
the americans will lose on the ground because they dont have 
enough troops i doubt theyll be able to push iraq out of 
kuwait 
besharati chief of intelligence for the islamic revolutionary 
guards corps during the war with iraq acknowledged that the 
americans will control the skies 
but air power can be used only to support ground forces he 
said it doesnt win wars on its own 
alireza a wartime intelligence officer who refused to be 
identified further said the iraqis chemical weapons were their 
cutting edge 
they could wipe out large numbers of troops at a time he 
said 
the americans have some elite units whove practiced desert 
warfare iraq has tens of thousands of soldiers whove actually 
fought under those conditions alireza said 
if the americans think they can fight a short quick war 
theyre wrong

the gatlin brothers larry steve and rudy 
are hankering to entertain the troops in the persian gulf but the 
country singers found out a lot of other entertainers had the same 
idea and the next available slot is february 
so the gatlins are doing the next best thing sending over a 
christmas special taped in las vegas and backed up by an 80voice 
high school choir 
larry gatlin has a soft spot for the thousands of soldiers sent 
to saudi arabia after iraq invaded kuwait aug 2 his voice broke 
as he talked about the possibility that come february there may 
be no need to entertain the troops 
i hope to god were out of there by then he said i hope

two governments made german unity possible this 
year but the united nations newly elected leadership faces 
perhaps an even more daunting task making it work 
in the rush to unify east and west germany left some of the 
most pressing questions for the government that would replace them 
including 
how to use dispose of analyze or make public the secret files 
on 6 million people kept by east germanys former secret police 
how to find and whether to prosecute communist party 
functionaries and police agents blamed for crimes ranging from 
corruption to murder 
how to sift through the morass of 1 million claims on eastern 
german property made by western germans who used to live in the 
region 
whether to move the seat of government to berlin the new 
capital or leave it in bonn 
the most immediate concern however will be dealing with the 
mounting costs of unification and the cash drain that former east 
germany has become 
a day after chancellor helmut kohl and his christian democrats 
were elected sunday to lead the united nation officials of 
germanys central bank gave comments seen as early warning signs 
that the costs of unification could hurt the strong german economy 
bundesbank president karl otto poehl perhaps the most powerful 
man in germany behind kohl said in a stern magazine interview that 
the governments borrowing plans to rebuild the eastern lands could 
hurt the economy 
poehl said drastic spending cuts were needed to offset the 
borrowing 
the government plans to borrow up to 100 billion in 1991 
johann wilhelm gaddum the bundesbank director responsible for 
eastern germany said officials hadnt understood warnings about 
the danger of high government borrowing 
when i look at the planned growth rates of the public budgets 
for 1991 i have doubts whether the message has been understood 
gaddum said in an interview on germanys ard television 
he said there are worries about the ability to finance the 
public budgets not only next year but also in the following year 
eastern germanys teetering economy is expected to crash and 
burn in the first three months of next year 
east germany was a principal exporter of industrial goods to 
other east bloc nations but many of those contracts expire in 
january 
economists say some may not be renewed by struggling nations 
that find it cheaper to use their nonconvertible currency to buy 
goods from hungary for example rather than germany 
likewise many enterprises are operating on credit that will run 
out in the first quarter of next year 
joblessness is officially only about 573000 about 61 percent 
of the work force but economists say up to 1 million people now 
are carrying around layoff notices that wont kick in until january 
or march 
joblessness next year may eventually reach 4 million roughly 
half of the work force in the former nation officials said 
the new germany also needs to mesh two sharply different school 
systems apply western environmental safeguards to one of the 
worlds most polluted regions and repair a communications and 
transportation system considered crucial to luring new investment 
into the east 
the questions already are beginning to create dissent among the 
politicians likely to comprise kohls new government 
the centrist free democrats the junior partner in kohls old 
government demanded monday that eastern german companies pay lower 
taxes than their western counterparts 
kohl has previously said he opposes such a move but on monday 
he refused to talk about it to reporters kohl needs the free 
democrats to get a majority in parliament 
kohl who put a sunny spin on economic questions during the 
campaign was more frank during his first postelection news 
conference monday 
he said that important decisions need to be made on ways to 
slash government spending and raise further revenues for eastern 
germany 
reiterating he would not raise taxes he did not spell out how 
additional revenues would be raised he called pollution in eastern 
germany an especially grave problem 
there is a lot to do here he said a comment that could 
refer to german unity in general

several hundred youths set fires looted businesses 
and hurled rocks and bottles at police monday night after six 
police officers were acquitted of most federal civil rights charges 
in the beating death of a smalltime drug dealer 
police said hundreds of people many wearing masks or paper bags 
on their heads chased after police looted and set fire to cars 
several stores and an abandoned home in the largely puerto rican 
neighborhood where leonardo mercado was fatally beaten by police in 
1988 
there were no immediate reports of injuries although several 
news photographers said they were roughed up and had their cameras 
stolen by bands of youths 
the riot began at the scene of a rally called to protest the 
acquittal of the officers including blacks hispanics and 
nonhispanic whites many puerto ricans say killing of mercado a 
puerto rican and later developments demonstrate that mainstream 
miami ignores their problems 
one youth ran down a street waving a puerto rican flag as others 
rioted leaving piles of broken televisions burned furniture 
shards of glass and about 10 torched or damaged cars in their wake 
this is such hate look around this is hate said daisy 
perez 55 the cuban owner of la reina shoe store and catholic 
church where rioters stole shoes bibles and wooden pews 
everything ive got theyve destroyed 
by late monday police said about 10 arrests had been made 
asked why police waited for some time before moving in miami 
police spokesman george law said it caught us off guard we had 
to assess the situation first 
about 200 officers in riot gear and with police dogs closed off 
about 10 city blocks and gradually took control of the area as 
helicopters flew overhead and smoke billowed from the torched 
buildings 
since weve been bringing in more officers we expect to bring 
it under control said miami police spokesman bobby navarro 
mayor xavier suarez and police chief perry anderson met 
privately with community leaders to discuss a response to the 
violence 
it seems to be some people are upset about the neglect of this 
community suarez said there are many many things we can do 
that anger could be heard repeatedly on the streets 
were looking for justice said 17yearold yvette diaz a 
puerto rican we want justice the other people the black people 
this is how they did it and it worked 
earlier monday the jury found the officers members of the 
citys elite drug squad innocent of 17 of the 24 counts and 
reported itself hung on the remaining charges after four days of 
deliberations 
this is just what ive been predicting in this case since day 
one that the people would back us said officer pablo camacho 
42 one of the squads leaders 
the other defendants were charlie haynes 31 ronald sinclair 
47 thomas trujillo 33 nathaniel veal jr 32 and andy watson 
33 
all six were undercover officers with the street narcotics unit 
often called the jumpout squad which is charged with cleaning 
up drugs in miami 
the officers were charged in the dec 16 1988 beating death of 
the 35yearold mercado they were accused of stomping on him 
pummeling him smashing him in the head with a flashlight or 
nightstick and then lying about it to investigators 
acquittals in police killings have touched off five riots in 
miami in the last decade most recently in 1989 when a hispanic 
police officers shooting of a black motorcyclist set off three 
days of rioting 
the violence monday night did not appear to be racerelated 
since blacks hispanics and nonhispanic whites were among the 
officers on trial the victim also was hispanic 
the government has until jan 17 to decide whether to refile the 
charges but anderson said the six would be allowed to return to 
their jobs 
we feel the officers have done what was necessary under the 
system anderson said we plan on bringing them back to work as 
expeditiously as possible 
the men faced charges of civil rights murder and conspiracy in 
mercados death they also were charged with civil rights 
violations by causing bodily harm to two teenage boys who regarded 
the slain drug dealer as their stepfather 
the officers were cleared of the conspiracy charge and one of 
the two assault charges against the boys and all but veal were 
acquitted on the other assault count the jury was hung on that 
count for veal as well as in the actual murder count for all six 
defendants 
us attorney dexter lehtinen said after the verdict that the 
civilrights murder count was the core of the indictment but 
added his office had not yet determined if it will pursue that 
count 
one of mercados stepsons pedro soto was angry as he emerged 
from the federal courthouse 
i expected justice to be done here this afternoon and i see 
there wasnt no justice said soto whose family has filed a 10 
million damage suit against the officers 
the officers lawyers argued that they were just doing their 
jobs and protecting themselves attorney milt hirsch said during 
the trial that it was kill or be killed 
but assistant us attorney dan gelber argued that police cannot 
use the drug war to excuse criminal behavior 
the prosecution maintained in the case that the police went 
looking for mercado a crack dealer after hearing of a threat 
against camachos life the police confronted mercado outside his 
apartment marched him inside and beat him to death authorities 
said 
among the witnesses were mercados 15yearold girlfriend and 
mercados two stepsons all three testified about alleged assaults 
on mercado one of the boys said an officer hurled him through a 
window

take one broomstick one ordinary aluminum pan 
and a few drops of what agriculture department researchers call 
sex attractant 
what have you got well just add insecticide a plastic cap and 
a limegreen coating and you come out with what researchers call a 
lethal new weapon in agricultures longrunning war against the 
boll weevil 
it may not look like much but developers say their new 
broomhandle bait stick will deliver a lopsided kill ratio in the 
fight against the hated archenemy of americas cotton producers 
its a simple concept really but represents putting together 
findings from 30 years of research on boll weevil behavior says 
usda research scientist gerald h mckibben 
in mississippi fields where the device is being tested for the 
second year scientists are finding 70 percent fewer weevils he 
says 
and one of the glories being claimed is that the homely looking 
implement uses just one gram of insecticide an acre 100 times less 
than usual backers say it could gain support from consumerists who 
wince at hosing down farm fields with chemicals in the fight 
against insects and other pests 
its possible that the bait stick idea could be used for other 
insect pests on other crops in the future mckibben says but 
we have to test that further 
mckibben developed the stick at the agricultural research 
service boll weevil laboratory in starkville miss testing is also 
in progress in texas 
mckibben says his agency has signed contracts with two private 
firms to improve the device for commercial use 
it is made by thrusting the broomstick through the center of a 
foillike aluminum pie pan and driving one end of the stick into 
the ground the pan with its interior facing up rides halfway up 
the stick 
the stick is topped with a limegreen plastic cap covered with 
insecticide a feeding stimulant and a chemical called grandlure 
scientists say grandlure is highly effective as a sex attractant 
for weevils and for some reason lime green seems to be their 
favorite color but when the critters pay a visit to the cap they 
get a nasty dose of insecticide and fall dead into the pan 
since the insecticide is on the cap it stays out of the soil 
and ground water 
limegreen compound that kills weevils has also been painted 
on the side of the stick a patent has been filed for both the 
coating and the cap 
before he was through last year mckibben was finding 200 to 300 
dead weevils a day in his pans agriculture officials say 
 
washington ap agriculture department forecasters say final 
figures will show strong vegetable production in 1990 exceeding 
the trend of the last decade and a half for the second straight 
year 
processing tomato and fresh onion crops appear destined to set 
production records while the dry edible bean crop is likely to come 
in just short of a record according to latest figures from usdas 
economic research service 
fall potato and sweet potato output also are on their way to 
posting increases forecasters say they say increases in these 
crops account for the bulk of the gain in overall vegetable 
production over last years level 
farmers expanded acreage planted in potatoes this year and thus 
boosted the crop 6 percent over last years level of 3704 million 
hundredweight 
dry edible bean production should end the year at 32 million 
hundredweight 33 percent above the 1990 level but 1 percent below 
1981 
vegetable growers were hammered by a hard freeze early in the 
1990 season it was especially tough on floridas tomato crop 
growers replanted though and by spring ideal conditions were 
hurrying an unusually abundant crop to market that sent prices 
down at times below the costs of picking and packing and there 
were reports of tomatoes left in fields 
the outlook for next season is for stronger supplies and prices 
generally below a year earlier for the crops 
 
washington ap supermarkets continue to have the largest 
share of the nations retail food sales new agriculture department 
figures show 
supermarkets constitute only about 10 percent of the stores 
selling food around the country but have 70 percent of the sales 
said a report from usdas economic research service 
the reason for the dominance of supermarkets is that they deal 
in high volume the report says it also says supermarkets are 
unlikely to remain unchanged as consumer trends already evident 
intensify 
forecasters say the supermarket will become provide an 
increasing number of goods and services to meet consumer demand for 
speed and convenience and soon may be serving dinner right at the 
store

a supreme court ruling reinforcing the right 
of criminal suspects to legal representation is an important 
deterrent to police coercion the lawyer who won the case says 
i view the opinion as a significant reaffirmation of the 
rights of the accused said attorney floyd abrams who handled 
the appeal of mississippi death row inmate robert s minnick 
im not surprised the court has determined that after someone 
in custody requests counsel that counsel must be present at all 
subsequent interrogations abrams said 
by a 62 vote monday the justices overturned minnicks murder 
conviction because police questioned the suspect without his lawyer 
present 
the court said that unless a previously questioned suspect asks 
to talk to police they may not renew questioning in the absence of 
his lawyer even after the suspect and attorney have conferred 
the high court previously had barred police from resuming the 
questioning of a suspect who asks to see a lawyer for the first 
time unless the suspect initiates the conversation 
the courts dissenters said the ruling protects the guilty and 
unduly hamstrings police 
the justice department which had urged the court to uphold 
minnicks conviction declined comment on the ruling 
in other actions monday the supreme court 
agreed to use a case from florida to decide whether police who 
have an owners permission to search a car must get a court warrant 
before opening any containers inside the vehicle 
shielded businesses from some bigmoney lawsuits filed by 
employees claiming they were fired so their employers would not 
have to pay pension benefits the court ruled unanimously that 
fired employees may sue in federal court but not in state courts 
for potentially larger punitive damages 
ruled by a 53 vote in a case from pennsylvania and virginia 
that a federal anticounterfeiting law may be used to crack down on 
the sale of used cars with phony mileage readings 
the mississippi confession case provided at least a mild 
surprise in that justice anthony m kennedy wrote the courts 
opinion 
kennedy dissented in 1988 when the court threw out a burglary 
conviction because police questioned a suspect who had invoked his 
right to a lawyer the issue in that case was whether the suspect 
could be quizzed about a crime other than the one for which he was 
arrested 
but on monday kennedy said whatever the ambiguities of our 
earlier cases on this point we now hold that when counsel is 
requested interrogation must cease and officials may not 
reinitiate interrogation without counsel present whether or not 
the accused has consulted with his attorney 
the decision relied largely on a 1981 high court ruling that 
barred police from reinitiating questioning of a suspect who has 
asked for but not yet talked to a lawyer mondays ruling extends 
that protection to instances in which a suspect already has 
conferred with an attorney 
kennedy said the purpose of both rulings is to discourage police 
from badgering a defendant into giving up the right to a lawyer 
provided by the courts landmark miranda ruling in 1966 
but justice antonin scalia in a dissenting opinion joined by 
chief justice william h rehnquist called the ruling a 
misguided expansion of constitutional rights that will 
discourage an honest confession 
the ruling produces a veritable fairyland castle of imagined 
constitutional restriction upon law enforcement scalia said 
justice david h souter did not take part in the case

defense secretary dick cheney is raising the 
ceiling on the number of military reservists who can be ordered 
into uniform for the persian gulf crisis to near the current legal 
limit of 200000 
the pentagon announced monday that cheney increased by 63000 
the maximum number of army navy and marine corps reservists who 
can be ordered to active duty for operation desert shield it said 
he signed the order on saturday 
the new limit is 188000 for all services although the air 
force and coast guard totals were not changed on nov 14 cheney 
had raised the overall ceiling from 50000 to 125000 
a total of 96834 members of the army navy air force marine 
corps and coast guard reserves and national guard are on active 
duty under callup authority granted by president bush on aug 23 
thousands more have been alerted to prepare to mobilize 
the pentagon gave no reason for increasing the callup limit 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff made a 
pitch for the reservists in congressional testimony monday he said 
their participation in desert shield has been a significant 
factor in affording us flexibility and balance 
the current callup of reserves is the first since the vietnam 
war and the largest since the 1961 crisis triggered by east 
germanys construction of the berlin wall 
cheneys latest order means the pentagon may approach the legal 
limit for reserve activations short of declaring war or a national 
emergency the president is limited to authorizing the callup of 
200000 reservists 
the secretarys move also indicates that the services are 
relying much more on reserve manpower to fill out a second wave of 
troop deployments to the persian gulf than they did in an initial 
deployment of 240000 air ground and sea forces 
when bush announced nov 8 that he had ordered large 
reinforcements sent to the gulf to augment the approximately 
230000 personnel then in the area fewer than 50000 reservists 
had been put on active duty most were in support roles to provide 
sealift and airlift of troops and supplies as well as medical 
service 
of the increases in authorized callups for the four services 
the biggest is for the army cheney raised its limit to 115000 
from 80000 but the largest proportional increase is for the navy 
whose limit triples from 10000 to 30000 up to now the navy has 
put 6182 reservists on active duty for desert shield 
the navy public affairs office said it could not immediately 
explain the reason for the large increase 
the limit for the marines was raised from 15000 to 23000 the 
air force ceiling remains at 20000 and there is no change in the 
coast guard limit of 1250

the deteriorating economy is hitting consumers 
in northeastern states hardest according to loan delinquency data 
for the julyseptember quarter 
nationally the percentage of consumer loans 30 or more days 
delinquent was a seasonally adjusted 256 percent at the end of the 
third quarter virtually unchanged from the 255 percent rate at 
the end of the apriljune period the american bankers association 
said monday 
the rate was 246 percent at the end of the first quarter of 
1990 and 264 percent at the end of the fourth quarter of 1989 
however the lack of movement masked sharp variations among 
regions 
the top five delinquency rates were new hampshire 612 percent 
connecticut 553 percent puerto rico 518 percent 
massachusetts 485 percent and west virginia 434 percent 
rounding out the top 10 were new york rhode island maine alabama 
and new jersey 
delinquency rates were lowest in arizona 127 percent 
nebraska 133 percent south dakota 134 percent colorado 156 
percent and minnesota 162 percent the rest of the bottom 10 
were tennessee washington north carolina california and idaho 
robert h dugger chief economist of the bankers group said 
the survey combined with other data indicates consumers 
nationally continued to pay their bills in the third quarter but 
were scaling back borrowing as the economy headed into what many 
analysts say is a recession 
consumers are well aware of the slowing economy and are making 
efforts to consolidate and repay debts rather than take on new 
ones dugger said 
government data shows consumers are taking fewer loans he said 
while anecdotal evidence from bankers indicates that financially 
stronger households may be taking out less expensive and 
longerterm home equity loans in order to pay off other consumer 
loans and reduce their monthly payments 
dugger said he expected the number of consumers behind on loan 
payments to be higher when figures are reported for the final three 
months of this year 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has said the economy 
slipped into a meaningful downturn in october the result of 
higher oil prices and shaken consumer confidence stemming from 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
michael k evans a washington economic consultant said 
consumer loan delinquencies generally do not rise significantly 
until well into a recession 
consumers havent been too hard hit yet evans said i 
dont think gasoline prices have that big of an impact i dont 
want to say it doesnt hurt at all but people are taking it in 
stride theyre cutting into their savings on the grounds that its 
just temporary 
the delinquency rate includes seven different types of 
closedend consumer loans personal two types of auto loans 
mobile home recreational vehicle property improvement and second 
mortgages 
the rate for openended home equity lines of credit which are 
tracked separately edged up from 075 percent in the second 
quarter to 08 percent in the third 
the banking group surveyed 800 commercial banks tracking loans 
in all 50 states puerto rico and the district of columbia

federal safety experts have warned for years 
that runway collisions like the one that killed eight people at 
detroit are a rising danger at increasingly congested us 
airports 
the national transportation safety board frustrated that many 
of its key accidentprevention recommendations have never been 
implemented voted in october to give the runway collision issue 
added urgency by placing it high on its list of most wanted 
safety improvements 
it is a serious problem said safety board spokesman mike 
benson after mondays runway collision of two northwest airlines 
passenger jets a dc9 and a 727 at detroit metropolitan airport 
weve said its serious benson said thats why weve 
made that safety area one of our most wanted recommendations 
according to government figures the nations airports reported 
382 runway incursions in 1987 incidents where an airplane taxied 
onto a runway without authorization from aircraft controllers or 
because of confusion in interpreting instructions the number of 
incidents declined to 190 in 1988 but they have been increasing 
since then 
aviations worst disaster was just such an ontheground 
accident two boeing 747s one operated by pan am and the other by 
the dutch airline klm collided on a foggy runway at tenerife in 
the canary islands on march 27 1977 
the collision of the jumbo jets killed 581 people 
in the detroit accident visibility at metropolitan airport was 
poor and the ground was wet from a morning snow and sleet storm 
that delayed flights 
tony dresden a spokesman for the national air traffic 
controllers association a union representing air controllers 
said preliminary reports from detroit controllers indicated that 
the dc9 pilot became lost on the runways 
the pilot gave the ground controller erroneous information 
about his position and turned right onto the runway where the 727 
was taxiing dresden said the dc9 pilot discovered at the 
very last moment where he was and so the ground controller told 
him to immediately get off that runway but it was too late 
the faa which oversees the nations air traffic control system 
had no immediate comment on dresdens statement 
a runway collision can have catastrophic effects since departing 
aircraft such as the two northwest jetliners at detroit are 
likely to be fully oaded with highly flammable jet fuel 
the safety board first addressed the runway incursion issue 
after three nearmisses by aircraft rolling down airport runways 
between june 1978 and february 1979 
in 1986 the safety board asked the faa to implement these 
measures 
require air traffic controllers to get confirmation from 
pilots in the form of reading back instructions they receive from 
the tower of all hold takeoff or crossing clearances and all 
clearances for access onto an active runway 
revise and enforce requirements to investigate and report 
operational or pilot errors that lead to runway incursions and to 
attempt to learn how and why they occur 
determine the most effective signs markings and procedures to 
prevent pilot induced runway incursions 
the faa said in april it was considering the readback 
requirement 
the safety board investigates all major transportation accidents 
involving us carriers setting a probable cause for each a team 
of investigators was dispatched hours after the detroit accident 
the board investigates about 2500 accidents a year and has 
issued nearly 8200 safety recommendations since its creation in 
1967 since it has no enforcement powers it can only recommend that 
safety improvements be made 
the boards most wanted list of such proposed improvements 
include recommendations involving cruise ships fishing boats 
automobile accidents truck safety and pipelines as well as several 
in the field of aviation

the justice department argues that documents 
cable news network wants returned may become evidence in the 
investigation of the leak of manuel noriegas taped prison 
telephone calls 
the court filing by the department on monday did not say how the 
15 documents might be such evidence 
the documents include a list of telephone numbers apparently 
compiled by cnn reporter marlene fernandez the justice department 
said 
cnns nov 8 broadcast about noriegas conversations with his 
attorneys and others from a federal prison near miami triggered a 
legal dispute over the networks right to air the tapes 
the supreme court last month upheld a federal judges temporary 
order barring cnn from airing any tapes of conversations between 
the deposed panamanian dictator and his lawyers pending a court 
review of the material 
last week the temporary ban was lifted by william m hoeveler 
the judge who is presiding over noriegas drug conspiracy case in 
miami 
cnn which played a segment of one conversation in defiance of 
hoevelers order has so far not aired any other conversations 
the justice department meanwhile is conducting a criminal 
investigation into the theft of the tapes which defense lawyers 
say compromised noriegas ability to get a fair trial 
in its filing monday in us district court in atlanta the 
justice department opposed a motion by cnn for the return of the 15 
documents that fbi agents kept following a search of a box 
containing material used by ms fernandez in preparing her 
broadcasts 
the box was found abandoned nov 12 in a room at the omni hotel 
and turned over to the hotels lost and found department 
the justice department noted that it had returned all the other 
items in the box to cnn including 52 documents and five videotape 
cassettes labeled noriega tapes 
copies of the 15 documents the fbi agents kept have also been 
furnished to cnn lawyers the justice department said 
all of these 15 documents relate to the fbis investigation 
into the theft of government property the department said in its 
brief 
fbi agent jeffrey b lang said in an affidavit attached to the 
pleadings that it is entirely likely that in any subsequent 
prosecution the items may well be introduced into evidence 
besides a piece of paper marked telephone numbers the 
seized material includes a noriega tapes script several sets 
of noriega transcripts and descriptions of recordings

bushs offer to send secretary of state james a baker iii to 
baghdad for talks with iraqi president saddam hussein but most 
dont think it will do any good according to a washington postabc

poll said they supported the decision to send baker to baghdad 53 
percent said they didnt think it would do any good 
in offering to send his secretary of state to talk to the iraqi 
president bush also invited saddam to send his foreign minister to 
washington for talks

the persian gulf crisis was at 61 percent roughly the same as that

lbj did it lloyd bentsen did it why asks a 
connecticut lawmaker shouldnt any capitol hill mogul be able to 
seek the white house without risking hardwon legislative clout 
rep sam gejdenson dconn said monday he will introduce a 
bill next month to let house members and senators run for president 
and still appear on the ballot for their legislative jobs 
the bill would adopt nationally the essence of a texas law 
designed for lyndon johnson and used by lloyd bentsen in 1988 to 
ensure he could run for vice president without giving up his senate 
seat 
texas is the only state with such a law gejdenson said 
it shouldnt just be texans who have the opportunity to run 
for reelection and president simultaneously gejdenson said 
and the country shouldnt be put in the position where a person 
of that experience should either remove himself from office or stay 
as majority leader or minority leader or committee chairman 
republicans viewed the legislation as a thinly veiled bid to 
widen the field of possible challengers against president bush in 
1992

a leading engineer says america must get 
serious about science or accept a generation of fastfood workers 
who dont need to know anything more than how to operate 
foreignmade cash registers 
we need to think about the workforce of tomorrow leonard 
ricks told a nasa advisory committee monday are we to condemn 
our young people to a future of employment in fast food chains if 
so they do not need an education to operate the foreign made 
computers that show the pictures of burgers fries and milkshakes 
eliminating the need for employees who read 
he said an american brain drain looms because of a poor 
atmosphere for creative technology and an aggressive engineer 
recruiting program by foreign companies 
our members are asking themselves what future is there for the 
american aerospace worker ricks testified unfortunately many 
of our colleagues are concluding that there is no future and are 
leaving 
he spoke at the sixth and last hearing of the advisory committee 
on the future of the us space program which is preparing to 
issue a final report on dec 17 the committee was set up in july 
by nasa administrator richard truly 
ricks executive director for the council of engineers and 
scientists organizations said public policy has focused on the 
management of the nations space program but not the creators of 
technology and said focus on nasas problems has created a 
witchhunt atmosphere 
today there is a feeding frenzy over many of the technical 
difficulties that naturally occur in any complex scientific 
endeavor he said both the print and electronic media have 
appeared jubilant over flaws in the hubble space telescope 
mirror fuel leaks and other technical problems 
that in turn has produced an enormous morale problem in the 
aerospace workforce said ricks whose organization represents more 
than 100000 engineers 
we are increasingly made to feel embarrassed by public policy 
makers who see our programs as wasting money that could be spent in 
meeting social needs we are humiliated by the medias presentation 
of our products as inferior and flawed

judicial authorities have requested 
the extradition of gen manuel noriega to stand trial in this 
country for murdering the leader of an attempted coup against the 
former panamanian ruler 
noriega in a miami prison facing trial on us drug trafficking 
charges is sought in panama in the murder of maj moises giroldi 
government prosecutor danilo montenegro told a news conference 
monday 
the district attorney asked the foreign ministry for his 
extradition said attorney general rogelio cruz it wasnt known 
whether the request had yet been conveyed to the united states 
noriegas defense attorney in miami is seeking to have the drug 
charges dropped on the grounds that secret taping of 
attorneyclient conversations and a dispute over noriegas legal 
fees have ruined noriegas chances of a fair trial 
giroldi led an aborted uprising against noriega in october 1989 
two months before the united states invaded panama and ousted the 
former dictator 
prosecutor nelson rovetto said giroldi who surrendered after 
the coup failed was among nine men executed on oct 3 and 4 1989 
near albrook field a us air station in downtown panama city 
sen jesse helms rnc said later that he had received 
reports noriega personally executed giroldi 
cruz said at least seven noriega allies agents of the defunct 
panama defense forces are also implicated in the killings 
panama also filed a 65 billion racketeering lawsuit against 
noriega in miami us district court last month 
the lawsuit says noriega participated in assassination torture 
drug trafficking money laundering embezzlement sale of visas and 
passports and other abuses while he was head of the defense forces 
prosecutor cecilia de martinez said authorities have reopened 
several murder cases that are linked to officials or cronies of 
noriega 
she accused investigators under the former regime of 
complicity in scuttling probes 
we cant explain why authorities let a lot of things go by 
she said 
prosecutor carlos herrera said former military officers would go 
on trial next year for the 1985 murder and decapitation of noriega 
opponent hugo spadafora a total of 25 people are implicated in the 
murder herrera said 
panama has also asked costa rica to extradite former maj 
rogelio morales to stand trial for the 1971 killing of university 
student jorge camacho de martinez said

donald trumps struggling taj mahal 
can achieve the stability it needs to keep its casino license 
trump executives say 
improved slot results and a restructuring of 675 million in 
debt will help stabilize the gaming halls finances the executives 
argued monday at a hearing before the casino control commission on 
the 8monthold jewel in trumps crown 
atlantic citys biggest casino is undergoing restructuring that 
lowered the interest rate on its debt and gave trumps creditors a 
50 percent stake in the gaming hall but the deal will also 
temporarily throw it into bankruptcy court 
if the commission concludes that the casino is financially 
unstable it could lift its license and appoint a conservator to 
operate it 
i think weve got a reasonable interest rate i think frankly 
weve got a wonderful property trump organization chief 
financial officer stephen bollenbach testified 
its hard to imagine a set of circumstances where there would 
not be enough cash flow to make bond payments 
trump did not attend the hearing 
the commission said it will hold more hearings dec 12 and 19 as 
details of the restructuring plan become final and will make a 
ruling after dec 19 
the commission will be prepared to do whatever it deems 
necessary to protect the public interest warned chairman steve 
perskie 
bollenbach and ed tracy president of trumps atlantic city 
holdings blamed the casinos problems on the recession in the 
northeast and its failure to capture enough of the slot machine 
market 
the taj will use a free coin program to boost its slot 
operations which have yet to recover since change machines broke 
down during the opening tracy said 
the hearing came three weeks after trump renegotiated the 675 
million in debt borrowed to finance his third casino here he 
reached the restructuring agreement one day after failing to make a 
473 million interest payment 
the state division of gaming enforcement did not disagree with 
the observations of trumps executives but said the taj mahals 
lagging slot performance and a weakening casino industry were cause 
for concern 
the division regulators said it was still too early to assess 
the restructuring deals prospects

the military rebellion that 
turned parts of buenos aires into a battleground two days before 
president bush is to arrive was argentinas fourth since 1987 and 
may have been the least effective 
challenged immediately by the air and armored power of loyalist 
troops mondays was the shortest and bloodiest of the four 
revolts at least 13 people were killed and about 60 wounded 
in brazil bush said he would go ahead with the scheduled state 
visit 
while earlier barracks rebellions forced shakeups in the high 
command and bigger service budgets this time surrender was 
unconditional president carlos menem said monday night about 18 
hours after the insurrection began 
menem said that not only will his military policy remain 
unchanged but rebel leaders may face the death penalty the 
military code of justice contemplates that possibility the full 
measure of law will be applied 
unlike the upheavals in april 1987 and january and december 
1988 loyalist troops showed little reluctance in firing on fellow 
soldiers 
the loyal troops used aerial bombing tanks mortars and 
highcaliber machine guns against rebelheld installations just 
before nightfall heavily armed troops surrounded army 
headquarters the last rebel stronghold 
about 120 rebels gave up after air force jets buzzed the 
headquarters building in downtown buenos aires two blocks from 
government house where menem works and from which he directed the 
counterattack 
hours earlier rebels at palermo infantry base five miles away 
surrendered as did rebels at a tank factory in boulogne 16 miles 
to the northwest 
in all about 450 mutinous soldiers and civilian rebels 
surrendered army officials said others who fled from boulogne and 
from wrecked tank columns were being sought among the arrested was 
rebel leader col enrique baraldini 
the insurgents final hope had been two columns of tanks that 
were knocked out of commission by air force bombing 
the triumph of the armed forces was absolute menem told a 
televised news conference 
the disturbances began before dawn when rebels with faces 
blackened commandostyle seized several floors at army 
headquarters hundreds of rebel soldiers and armed civilians also 
took over the palermo infantry base boulogne tank factory and at 
least two other installations 
the rebels insisted their intention was not to overthrow the 
government but to press their demands for changes in the top 
military staff 
but unlike the three insurrections that undermined the 
presidency of raul alfonsin menem refused to negotiate 
menem declared a state of siege later approved by congress 
this is an attempted coup detat and will be treated as such 
menem said 
one motivation for acting decisively was bushs scheduled visit 
a daylong series of firefights in and near this capital of 10 
million was capped late in the afternoon by warplanes bombing rebel 
tanks on public roads 
during the revolt bullets hit vice president eduardo duhaldes 
helicopter as it landed at government house just two blocks from 
army headquarters duhalde was unhurt government house and the 
economics ministry were also hit 
at least seven soldiers one rebel and five civilians were 
killed before order was restored the government news agency telam 
said the civilians were in a bus hit by a tank 
twenty people were injured in that crash telam reported at 
least 11 soldiers and 18 rebels were shot and wounded army and 
hospital officals said as were at least 10 civilians news 
agencies reported 
the final shootout took place after dark in entre rios province 
to the north of buenos aires and across the parana river seventeen 
rebels were wounded noticias argentinas reported and 32 arrested 
about 50 escaped 
menem said banks and foreign exchange houses which closed 
during mondays fighting would reopen today jorge newbery 
metropolitan airport was reopened monday night menem said the 
state of siege would be lifted by weeks end 
the insurrection had been carried live on tv and radio and 
public gatherings were banned 
in april 1987 and january 1988 then lt col aldo rico led 
barracks revolts in a bid to halt the trials of officers accused of 
human rights abuses during the 197683 military dictatorship force 
generals to retire and the government to increase the military 
budget 
rico was imprisoned and cashiered but following the revolts 
most trials were halted military pay was increased and a number of 
generals retired 
the december 1988 insurrection led by col mohamed ali seineldin 
had similar motives and results 
he was forced to retire but army chief gen jose caridi and a 
number of other generals retired soldiers received pay increases 
and nearly 300 officers who faced trial eventually were pardoned by 
menem 
under menem the military budget has shrunk because of 
government efforts to control the fiscal deficit as have the 
budgets of most other departments 
menem has put the armys biggest base campo de mayo on the 
outskirts of buenos aires up for sale along with many defense 
industries 
the privatizations are part of his program to spur an economy in 
recession by reducing the role of the state and attracting foreign 
capital and technology

iraq will allow 1000 soviets about a third of 
those still stranded in the country to leave within the next three 
weeks according to soviet television 
twentynine soviet workers whose iraqi government contracts 
expired flew home monday on an aeroflot jetliner the airlines 
baghdad manager alexander kirichenko told the vremya news 
program 
today we dont have much work to do only 29 passengers 
kirichenko said but the iraqi authorities have given permission 
for 1000 specialists to leave in the next two or three weeks 
about 8000 soviets including military advisers were living in 
iraq when it invaded kuwait on aug 2 about 3000 of them 
including children left shortly after the invasion and another 
1000 left in september and october 
then some began encountering problems securing exit visas 
the soviet union which has not sent troops to join the usled 
multinational force arrayed against iraq in saudi arabia was 
initially reluctant to accuse the iraqis of refusing to allow its 
citizens to leave 
but as soviet leaders adopted a harder line against iraq over 
its refusal to withdraw from kuwait backing the un resolution 
authorizing the use of force against iraq that passed on thursday 
they took baghdad to task 
last week the soviets accused iraq of breaking a promise to 
allow 1000 additional soviets to leave 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze then warned that the 
soviet union would use military force if its citizens were harmed 
none are believed to be among the human shields held by iraq at 
potential military targets 
foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said monday that about 
40 soviet military specialists remain in iraq unable to get out of 
their contracts to train iraqi soldiers on using and maintaining 
sovietsupplied weapons 
he said the remaining soviets worked for various iraqi 
government agencies mostly in energy and construction 
the soviet union was iraqs main military supplier before iraq 
seized kuwait

broadly in thin trading today while the dollar rose against the 
yen for the fourth consecutive trading day

percent closing at 2186261

million shares

they said margin calls in december will total about 15 trillion 
yen 112 billion with about 300 billion yen 224 billion 
slated for this week

the dollar closed at 13435 yen up 135 yen from mondays close 
of 13300 yen it opened at 13433 yen and ranged between 13350

days 
some 1273 billion changed hands in spot trading compared with 
1144 billion on monday 
atsushi komatsu a dealer with fuji bank said the days 
dollarbuying was mainly for technical reasons 
but he said the us currency was in demand because of 
dollardenominated interest rates staying high in connection with 
the persian gulf crisis 
the yen also weakened against the german mark because of 
relatively higher german interest rates komatsu said 
in bond dealings the price of the benchmark no 119 10year

8681 their yield rose to 7350 percent from 7315 percent

the agency said the draft would be presented to the entire 
ruling party and later to a party congress scheduled for the 
spring 
the congress also will consider a platform that confirms 
socialism as the goal of the nation and the partys leading role in 
achieving it according to an earlier report by the official news 
agency 
a recent official vietnamese report estimated the countrys per 
capita annual income in 1989 at about 210 making vietnam among 
the worlds poorest countries 
the objectives of the new plan include emancipation from the 
state of being a poor and underdeveloped country and creation of 
conditions for a faster development in the early 21st century 
it said the country shattered by decades of war with france 
the united states and its neighbors should at least emerge from 
its current economic crisis by 1995 
politically vietnam has clung to strict party control over the 
affairs of its citizens the countrys 1978 invasion of cambodia 
and the collapse of the soviet bloc have led to growing isolation 
after its sixth party congress in late 1986 the government 
adopted economic reforms that gave companies greater autonomy and 
allowed farmers to work land individually instead of on 
collectives 
those reforms led to turningpoint changes the report said 
but the new plan will further reduce state control and encourage 
small and mediumsized enterprises it said

new york city is closing out its bloodiest year 
on record more than 2000 murders so far and december 
traditionally one of the deadliest months has barely begun 
police said the increased availability of guns was directly 
responsible for the death toll surpassing last years record of 
1905 
this years count of more than 2000 reflected the first 11 
months of the year according to unofficial statistics released 
monday thirteen people were murdered saturday and sunday nights 
the first two days of december police said 
the murder count included 87 people who died in a fire set at a 
social club in march 
guns were responsible for 65 percent of the people murdered in 
the first eightmonths of the year police said 
deputy inspector thomas v connolly of the police office of 
management analysis and planning said 9410 guns were taken off the 
streets through the first six months of 1990 compared to more than 
16000 for all of last year 
connolly said many murders began as disputes or robberies and 
escalated because a weapon was used an overwhelming majority 73 
percent of the homicide victims were known to the people who 
killed them he said

scientists dismissed a climatologists 
forecast of a major quake in the midwest this week but worried that 
people wont be ready for the real thing 
we dont want you to stop being prepared for an earthquake 
even if a severe jolt fails to occur buddy schweig a geologist at 
memphis state university said monday at a meeting of the american 
geophysical union 
iben browning a new mexico climatologist has warned that 
strong tidal forces mean there is a 5050 chance of a quake on the 
new madrid fault of 65 to 75 on the richter scale on sunday or 
monday give or take two days 
many scientists call the forecast nonsense but say it is true 
the new madrid fault is capable of producing devastating quakes as 
it did in 1811 and 1812 
a repeat today of those quakes could cause 4500 deaths and 51 
billion in damage according to a mid1980s study by a memphis 
engineering firm 
a us geological survey advisory group issued a report in 
october disputing brownings projection 
there is no scientific basis to the browning prediction 
said lawrence braile a purdue university seismologist and member 
of the panel browning has put a 50 percent chance on it which 
is a ridiculous number 
browning who lives in tijeras nm is on vacation and 
unavailable for comment said his daughter evelyn garriss 
scientists would be embarrassed if the forecast for a big quake 
in the midwest san francisco bay area or japan came true this 
week as is possible 
this is not something wed like to be wrong about admitted 
advisory group member tom heaton seismologist in charge of the 
geological survey office in pasadena 
the new madrid zone stretches from cairo ill southwest 
through new madrid mo to marked tree ark 
in 181112 when the region was sparsely populated the fault 
produced three and possibly four great earthquakes estimated at 75 
to larger than 8 on the richter scale 
the quakes killed several dozen people toppled cabins snapped 
trees temporarily reversed the flow of the mississippi river and 
reportedly cracked pavement or rang church bells as far away as 
washington new york and boston

the politicians the hucksters the 
souvenir hunters they all rumbled through this town like an 
earthquake about the only thing that didnt make itself felt was 
the earthquake itself 
climatologist iben browning has shaken this sleepy hamlet of 
3300 by saying there was a 50 percent chance of a major quake 
along the new madrid fault this week 
some seismologtists used words like ridiculous to describe the 
projection but along the 120mile fault that runs from marked 
tree ark to cairo ill schools closed some people stayed away 
from work and hordes of reporters arrived just in case the quake 
really happened 
it didnt happen said seanthomas morrissey technical 
director of st louis universitys geophysical observatory the 
university runs a network of 60 seismographs that sense the 
slightest tremor in the fault 
there is a small probability of an earthquake on any given 
day but its the same today as on any other day said lawrence 
braile a purdue university seismologist and member of a us 
geological survey advisory group browning has put a 50 percent 
chance on it which is a ridiculous number 
browning was vacationing at an undisclosed location monday said 
his daughter evelynn garriss 
mrs garriss noted there was a big quake in the soviet union 
within the same 30 to 60degree north latitudes that we were 
concerned about but mrs garriss declined to say whether that 
fulfilled her fathers projection 
in any case she noted that her father said the quake could 
happen any time from 48 hours before monday to 48 hours afterward 
lets wait until the whole 48 hours are over she said 
browning said his projection was based on the fact that the sun 
and moons tidal pull on earths oceans reached a 27year high at 5 
am sunday 
although that didnt produce a quake on monday new madrid was 
reeling from all the attention it brought 
its been good for business councilwoman barbara jones said 
after a council meeting monday night 
among the entrepreneurs who showed up to capitalize on the 
excitement was lynn akins of sikeston mo promoting his outdoor 
safety equipment including a sleeping bag that opens up into a 
huge help banner tom benz of st louis pulled a barbecue 
smoker into town to promote his catering business 
at one point 20 tv news satellite trucks jammed main street 
jones expressed concern that all the attention could hurt new 
madrid as word of its active earthquake fault spreads in the 
winter of 18111812 when the region was sparsely populated it 
produced three and possibly four great earthquakes estimated at 75 
to larger than 8 on the richter scale 
but city administrator don lloyd said he wasnt worried that 
business people considering relocating would think of earthquakes 
when they think of new madrid 
i dont think that will be a factor long term he said

rampaging youths destroyed daisy perezs makeshift 
catholic church and shoe store then they returned to mock her 
grief 
theyve destroyed me inside said perez sitting on the only 
wooden pew left in the church she ran for 23 years this was my 
life this is everything ive got 
perez said monday she understood why the youths were angered 
after six police officers were acquitted earlier in the day of most 
federal charges in the beating death of a puerto rican drug dealer 
from her neighborhood 
but she couldnt understand who would steal the church pews and 
she asked why the youth would take out their anger on her stealing 
her livelihood 
they took my bibles they took all of my shoes she said 
this is such hate 
as mayor xavier suarez promised perez the church would be 
repaired in time for mass on wednesday the same kids who had 
ruined the store returned and stood behind suarez 
oh poor me oh poor me they sobbed and laughed 
sarcastically 
the mayor met privately with some community leaders and vowed to 
give more recognition to the puerto rican neighborhood he admitted 
has been neglected 
the violence began after the officers were acquitted of beating 
to death leonardo mercado two years ago they faced a maximum of 
life in prison 
it was supposed to be the chair the electric chair man 
shouted one looter who carried a tv set out of a store and smashed 
it 
two teenage girls giggled as they ran from the store holding 
hands and carrying bottles of scotch other youths smashed in the 
doors and windows and carted off merchandise 
furniture was hauled out put in a pile and set on fire a 
burning chair thrown through the front door sent the store up in 
flames 
small crowds attacked tv trucks and photographers smashing van 
windows and grabbing cameras residents hustled some reporters into 
their homes for protection 
when police arrived several hours into the melee residents 
hissed and shouted hardly intimidated by the officers riot gear 
one cop kneeled and pointed his shotgun toward a group of 
teenage boys another cop shouted at him dont shoot em 
alive 
im so depressed to see all this said dwayne green a 
21yearold black resident i can see why theyre doing this but 
theyre going to suffer anyway its just like the blacks they 
suffer anyway

todays mayoral runoff in berkeley offered 
voters a chance to recalibrate the citys political compass which 
has always pointed left 
oneterm mayor loni hancock wants to continue that liberal 
agenda that since the 1960s has put berkeley at the forefront of 
issues such as human rights the environment affirmative action 
and help for the poor 
challenger fred weekes a oneterm city councilman said local 
government should concentrate on more mundane problems such as 
potholes and redevelopment 
and i think we need to get rid of the ideological practices in 
city hall he said 
the home of the university of california at berkeley was a 
hotbed of leftist politics and student unrest during the vietnam 
war the university was the birthplace of the college free speech 
movement in 1964 
hancock who was on the council for eight years during the 
1970s said berkeley can remain dedicated to social change while 
caring for the infrastructure and other needs in the city of about 
109000 people 
berkeley is really at a crossroads she said monday we 
pioneered environmental protection we pioneered many social 
programs to make peoples lives better 
but we also have laid the groundwork for programs in the city 
from affordable housing to recycling and downtown revitalization 
the 50yearold mayor continued the important thing is to see 
them through to completion 
the runoff was necessary because hancock failed to get more than 
50 percent of the nov 6 vote she fell 38 votes short out of 
44339 cast 
weekes 65 spent about 200000 and hancock has spent about 
half that in her bid to retain the parttime job that pays 21000 
a year 
most of weekes support has come from the hills the more 
affluent part of berkeley and from developers who dont like 
rules that require them to pay for programs such as traffic 
affordable housing and child care 
hancocks strongholds are the liberal some say leftist 
berkeley citizens action party that she is affiliated with 
university students and residents of the flats

the african national congress 
warned today that the factional fighting that has claimed at least 
78 lives in recent days threatens to derail peace talks with the 
whiteled government 
an anc statement charged security forces were responsible for 
the violence that erupted in black townships around johannesburg 
over the weekend it said the disorder was intended to discredit 
the anc in talks on ending apartheid 
unrest areas have now been declared to tokoza katlehong 
vosloorus and bekkersdal granting the very police responsible for 
the carnage even greater powers over the lives of our people the 
statement said 
the violence placed the peace process in jeopardy it said 
theres no way we can talk peace if people continue to be 
killed communist party leader joe slovo said monday the 
communist party is allied with the anc 
some residents of the townships have claimed that zulu warriors 
were being aided by armed whites but provided no evidence of this 
the fighting pitted zulus loyal to the inkatha freedom party 
against xhosas and other blacks who support the anc the countrys 
main opposition group the anc has long accused the government of 
siding with inkatha 
president fw de klerk has promised to scrap apartheid and 
share power with the black majority talks between the government 
the anc and other black groups on writing a new constitution are 
expected to begin next year 
no violence was reported today in tokoza and other townships 
police said hundreds of terrified residents have fled their homes 
and mmore than a half million people live in the townships 
currently under curfew 
south african news reports said the fighting was set off 
saturday when zulu gangs searched houses in tokoza for xhosas and 
killed several people 
inkatha leader chief mangosuthu buthelezi said his forces were 
not to blame 
i object therefore to blame being automatically apportioned to 
socalled impis regiments of the inkatha freedom party he 
said in a statement 
zulu leaders claimed several of their followers had been shot by 
police for no apparent reason 
about 1000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting in 
johannesburg townships since august the fighting subsided after 
september but flared anew in recent weeks 
the anc and inkatha both oppose apartheid but are divided by 
rival leadership and differing visions of a future south africa 
inkatha favors freemarket system while the anc leans more to 
socialist economic programs

condoms be given out on request to new yorks 261000 high school 
students 
schools chancellor joseph fernandez is expected to present the

and drugstores without the benefit of an educational or counseling 
component fernandez explained 
he said in a memo to the board that he was taking action because 
new york leads the nation in adolescent aids cases

reservations

police set up checkpoints along israels 1967 
borders and frisked palestinians driving from the occupied lands 
into israel today in the first sign of sweeping new security 
measures 
news reports said defense minister moshe arens also plans to 
increase deportations of palestinians and block thousands of arabs 
from entering israel 
the measures are a reaction to the stabbing attacks that have 
claimed five israeli lives in the last two months seven 
palestinians involved in the attacks were killed by police or 
israeli revenge seekers 
on sunday three west bank palestinians boarded a bus in tel 
aviv stabbed to death one passenger and wounded three police shot 
to death one assailant and captured the other two 
israel radio reported massive traffic jams on the roads leading 
to tel aviv as the checkpoints went up along the socalled green 
line the boundary with the west bank and gaza strip before israel 
captured them in the 1967 war 
were doing body checks to see if they have knives we also 
check their bags and their cars police spokesman adi gonen said 
its not a pleasure for them but we have no choice 
police are now obliged to carry a pistol or uzi submachine gun 
at all times gonen said police also recommended that bus drivers 
be allowed to carry guns on the job he said 
the maariv newspaper ran a frontpage picture of a driver 
working the route on which sundays attack occurred driver salman 
bassu held up a pistol brass knuckles and a knife he said he 
would carry the weapons on the job every day 
yedioth ahronoth newspaper reported arens wanted to increase to 
15000 the number of restrictive identity cards for palestinians 
about 10800 such cards have been issued so far the cards prohibit 
their holders from visiting israel 
the stabbings are meant as revenge for the oct 8 police 
shootings on jerusalems temple mount that killed at least 17 
arabs 
about 110000 palestinians work in israel most as day laborers 
labor minister david magen has suggested reducing their number by 
50000 to make room for soviet jewish immigrants 
israel radio said arens is planning to step up deportations of 
palestinians israel has deported 60 palestinians since the start 
of the uprising in the occupied lands nearly three years ago 
the expulsions have been criticized by the united states europe 
and human rights groups as a violation of the fourth geneva 
convention 
the convention which israel signed bars deportations of 
civilians from occupied areas israel argues that the geneva 
convention only bans mass deportation not expulsions of a few 
individuals

iraq claims more than 1400 children under 
5 years old have died due to shortages caused by the un embargo 
but doctors and western diplomats say there are no serious 
shortages of food or basic medicines 
iraq said today it was reducing the december rations of sugar 
and tea for adults by onefourth but it said the allotment for all 
other foods covered by rationing would remain the same 
the report of child deaths stemming from the economic sanctions 
came from iraqi health minister abdulsalam mohammed saeed 
he told the official iraqi news agency on monday that 1416 
children had died and that many of them had not received needed 
medicine or sufficient milk because of shortages created by the 
embargo 
there is no way to independently verify iraqi figures on child 
deaths or to confirm how many if any of the children died for those 
reasons 
the government is the sole importer of medicine in iraq and the 
only official source of information on supply however a doctor at 
one baghdad hospital who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
recently there was no shortage of basic medicines or medical 
supplies in iraq 
iraqis say they can buy medicines and powdered milk for their 
children but mostly only at exorbitant black market rates 
western diplomats in baghdad who generally discount reports of 
acute food and medicine shortages said iraq received more than 30 
tons of medical supplies between midoctober and midnovember alone 
in exchange for the release of western hostages 
another 40 tons of medical supplies reportedly were shipped to 
iraq in late november diplomats said italy alone sent 25 tons of 
medicine mainly measles polio and diphtheria vaccines on nov 
24 all of it was earmarked for iraqi children 
some diplomats and medical personnel in baghdad suggested last 
month that iraq might be stockpiling medicine in case of war and 
that some of the reported shortages resulted from profiteering 
governmentrun hospitals report shortages of antibiotics 
medicines vaccines and baby formula and tell patients they must 
bring their own 
iraqis say prices at pharmacies and on the black market are 
often at least five times higher than normal they say many 
pharmacies enticed by higher profits have diverted stocks to the 
black market 
the government rationing plan instituted in september limits 
each child under a year old to three 16ounce cans of baby formula 
a month at governmentsubsidized stores each can costs 225 at 
the official rate 
iraqis forced to supplement their childrens diet with powdered 
milk bought on the black market pay as much as 40 dinars for a 
22pound can that price beyond the means of many iraqis amounts 
to 120 at the official rate and between 8 and 13 at varying 
blackmarket rates 
iraq has often claimed the sanctions are inhumane and deny food 
milk and medicine to children but the diplomats note that the 
sanctions do not prohibit imports of food and medicine for 
humanitarian reasons 
food shelves at private stores and vegetable markets in the 
capital are well stocked often with goods looted from kuwait or 
smuggled in from iran or jordan 
prices of many goods have soared to three and four times their 
normal cost but with the arrival of looted supplies from kuwait

the commander of turkeys land forces was 
appointed chief of the general staff today to replace a general who 
resigned because he differed with president turgut ozal over 
persian gulf policy 
prime minister yildirim akbulut announced the appointment of 
gen dogan gures to succeed gen necip torumtay who resigned 
monday 
the appointment was in accordance with military tradition as 
gures was the second highest ranking army general after torumtay 
however it may not solve ozals problems sources said gures 
shares torumtays view that turkey should refrain from an active 
role in any possible war to force iraq out of kuwait 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said gures is 
also uncompromising in his opposition to islamic fundamentalism in 
this predominantly moslem but secular country 
analysts say torumtays resignation was an indication of the 
armys dissatisfaction with what is viewed as the ozal governments 
encouragement of islamic fundamentalist groups 
in his letter of resignation torumtay said only that he found 
it impossible to continue in his post in the light of principles 
i believe in and my understanding of statecraft 
commentaries in turkish papers today lauded torumtays decision 
as honorable and democratic 
torumtay was the third senior official to resign in three 
months defense minister safa giray resigned in november and 
foreign minister ali bozer in october the latter reportedly 
because he differed with ozal over gulf policy 
foreign ministry and defense officials are said to feel that 
ozal is dragging turkey into war with iraq in his enthusiasm to 
join the western coalition grouped against saddam hussein 
torumtay a 64yearold former military attache in tokyo and 
washington had been chief of staff for three years 
in a farewell message to turkeys 800000strong armed forces 
the secondlargest army in nato after the united states torumtay 
said the road shown by ataturk was the goal which cannot be 
deviated from 
kemal ataturk set up modern turkey in 1923 and instituted 
westernizing reforms firmly rooting the country in secularism 
fundamentalists estimated to make up 12 percent of turkeys 
population of 57 million have grown increasingly militant many 
turks hold them responsible for the killing this year of three 
prominentadvocates of secularism 
since iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 ozal has placed 
turkey firmly at the side of the united states he cut off 
pipelines carrying iraqi crude through this country and banned all 
trade with iraq 
turkish officials have ruled out the possibility of turkey 
opening a second front from the north if the united states and 
its allies go to war against iraq 
urged on by ozal however parliament has authorized the 
government to send turkish troops abroad and to allow foreign 
troops in this country if necessary 
us air force f16 and f111 aircraft have been deployed at the 
incirlik base in southern turkey since august 
the prominent daily cumhuriyet reported sunday that a toplevel 
strategy meeting on the crisis was held saturday at the cankaya 
palace military officials present argued that turkey was doing 
enough by tying up eight iraqi divisions along its border and 
should stay out of war the newspaper said 
ozal who took office last year after serving as prime minister 
since 1983 has been ignoring sections of the 1982 constitution 
written under military rule that theoretically limit his power 
officials say he runs the country especially its foreign 
affairs through akbulut the prime minister and his handpicked 
successor 
three times since 1960 the military has toppled turkeys 
civilian government the latest takeover was in 1980 following a 
period of political violence which claimed 5000 lives

a newspaper speculated today that president 
mikhail s gorbachev may name vadim bakatin to the new post of vice 
president after having removed him as interior minister over the 
weekend 
neither gorbachev nor bakatin immediately commented on the 
report in komsomolskaya pravda which added to a swirl of 
speculation in the supreme soviet legislature on the intentions 
behind gorbachevs latest shakeup 
traditionalist hardline legislators praised gorbachevs 
decision to dismiss bakatin as interior minister and replace him 
with a kgb general who is expected to crack down on independence 
movements and black marketeering 
but the newspaper report raised the possibility that gorbachev 
could be feinting left and striking right removing a favorite of 
reformists only to place him in a more important post 
the interior ministry commands the soviet militia or police 
which includes special riot squads and paramilitary troops 
bakatin is popular among reformers who support the independence 
movements in the baltics and other restive republics because he 
put a tight rein on the riot police after 19 peaceful demonstrators 
were killed by troops wielding shovels and gas in tbilisi georgia 
last year 
traditionalist communists have criticized the interior ministry 
and gorbachev for not declaring emergencies and cracking down on 
independence activists in moldavia georgia and other hotspots 
asked whether bakatin would be named vice president 
presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko told a news conference 
today i cannot tell you the issue has not been considered 
yet 
ignatenko added that gorbachev did not remove bakatin because of 
any dissatisfaction with his performance 
i believe that a new post is in line for him but we will have 
to be patient to see what that post will be he said 
mikhail bronshtein a lawmaker from the baltic republic of 
estonia said bakatin was unpopular among hardliners there because 
he had agreed to transfer law enforcement authority from central to 
local officials 
bakatin who was removed as interior minister on sunday was 
replaced by boris pugo 53 a communist party official who became a 
kgb major general while running the secret police in latvia in the 
early 1980s 
col victor alksnis a lawmaker who has threatened to seek 
gorbachevs resignation unless he takes action by dec 17 to 
prevent the breakup of the nation told reporters monday that the 
replacement of bakatin was a good step 
gorbachevs removal of bakatin is obviously a response to the 
ultimatum by alksnis who heads the soyuz or union group of 
hardline lawmakers said dmitri simes a soviet expert at the 
carnegie endowment for peace in washington but simes added that it 
was difficult to know whether gorbachev was truly sympathic to 
their demands or merely making a politically expedient concession 
to them 
pugo is a friend of alksnis simes said both men are latvians 
who are extremely unpopular in their native land for their 
opposition to independence from the soviet union he said 
bakatin previously has been mentioned as a possible candidate 
for prime minister he was nominated for president last spring and 
declined to run against gorbachev 
sundays announcement said bakatin was being released in 
connection with his transition to another job interior ministry 
spokesman boris p mikhailov said today that gorbachev has 
temporarily assigned bakatin to study changes in the structure of 
the presidential council on which he sits 
in a nov 17 speech to the supreme soviet gorbachev indicated 
he would eliminate both the 16member presidential council and the 
council of ministers in favor of several new bodies including a 
national security council but he has not provided details on how 
the new bodies would work

iraq said today it will let nearly 3300 
soviet experts leave the country but demanded that the kremlin pay 
to terminate their work contracts 
the official radio and the iraqi news agency said the ruling 
revolutionary command council headed by president saddam hussein 
decided to allow the soviets to depart 
in moscow presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko said the 
kremlin has not been officially notified of the iraqi decision 
we have not yet had signals that would inspire such a hope 
said ignatenko 
he said there are 3232 soviets in iraq mostly construction 
workers oil and gas experts and pipeline layers thousands of 
soviets left iraq after saddams troops overran kuwait 
iraqi radio and ina quoted the revolutionary command council as 
saying that the remaining soviets can go as of wednesday 
the council said it acted so that this issue of soviet experts 
remains outside the framework of the various deals under way which 
regrettably involve the soviet union 
we have decided to allow all soviet experts wishing to travel 
out of iraq to do so provided that the soviet government alone 
assumes full responsibility for the consequences of breaking 
contracts in this regard the council statement said 
iraq had warned foreign companies it would demand compensation 
for any contract breached after its aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
after the invasion the united nations imposed an international 
trade embargo on iraq 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin indicated the 
kremlin had no problem over compensation 
if the matter has been resolved now then obviously the 
contract issue has also been resolved he said in moscow 
a soviet oil ministry official sarkis arkilian has been in 
baghdad for more than a week trying to win exit visas for the 
soviets 
the soviet union has backed all 12 un security council 
resolutions against iraq including one thursday authorizing the 
use of force to drive iraq from kuwait unless its army withdraws by 
jan 15 
after last weeks vote soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze said moscow would not hesitate to use force against 
iraq to protect its citizens 
in moscow soviet television reported earlier that iraq has 
given 1000 soviets permission to leave twentynine soviet workers 
whose iraqi government contracts expired flew home monday soviet 
tv quoted alexander kirichenko baghdad manager for the soviet 
airline aeroflot as saying 
iraq banned many foreigners from traveling in response to the 
usled military buildup that followed the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait saddams government has relocated hundreds of foreigners to 
strategic sites to serve as human shields against possible 
attack 
soviet citizens were excused from the travel ban and no soviets 
were detained at strategic sites 
moscow was iraqs main arms supplier during the 198088 war 
against iran and there were about 200 military advisers in iraq at 
the time of the invasion

hundreds of youths looted stores and burned cars 
after six police officers were acquitted in the fatal beating of a 
puerto rican drug dealer the uprising miamis fifth riot in a 
decade caught police off guard 
the fivehour melee in a puerto rican section ended monday night 
when about 200 officers in riot gear moved into the dead mans 
neighborhood and made about 10 arrests 
the only injuries reported were to two news photographers who 
said they were roughed up and their cameras stolen 
except for curious onlookers watchful police reporters 
photographers and television news crews the area was quiet this 
morning 
among the onlookers was businessman patrick gerritts who 
somberly surveyed the collapsed smoldering ruins of his general 
contracting firm 
theyve ruined us he said of the people who first looted 
then torched his officewarehouse theyve ruined my life im 53 
years old gerritts said ive been coming here for 35 years 
every day of my life 
the violence began after the officers were acquitted of beating 
to death leonardo mercado two years ago by stomping on him 
pummeling him and smashing him in the ead with a flashlight or 
nightstick 
several dozen youths their faces concealed by paper bags and 
shirts gathered at a park and began pelting police and passing 
vehicles with rocks and bottles 
as the melee built several stores were torched and their 
merchandise and furniture set ablaze in the street about 10 cars 
were set on fire overturned or had their windows smashed 
we want justice said 17yearold yvette diaz the other 
people the black people this is how they did it and it 
worked 
police killings have prompted violence in miami four other times 
in the past decade most recently in 1989 when a hispanic police 
officers shooting of a black motorcyclist set off three days of 
rioting by blacks 
police relations worsened this year when officers violently 
broke up a demonstration by haitians outside a cubanowned clothing 
store 
but city officials were stunned by the intensity of anger in the 
puerto rican neighborhood 
we really didnt expect this riot we did expect some protests 
a group of mercados friends family but we didnt expect 
something like this said police spokesman armando villorin 
no immediate estimate of damage was available 
this is such hate said daisy perez whose storefront 
catholic church and shoe shop had been emptied of shoes bibles and 
wooden pews 
earlier monday a federal jury found six members of the police 
drug squad innocent of 17 of 24 counts and reported itself 
deadlocked on six civil rights murder counts in the 1988 slaying of 
mercado a 35yearold smalltime drug dealer 
the government has not indicated whether it will retry the 
officers 
the officers lawyers had argued they were just doing their jobs 
and protecting themselves from mercado who allegedly went into a 
frenzy and was thrashing about when police arrested him 
this is just what ive been predicting in this case since day 
one that the people would back us officer pablo camacho the 
42yearold alleged leader of the attack on mercado said after the 
verdict 
mercados family which has filed a 10 million lawsuit against 
the officers was angered by the acquittal if they were found 
guilty none of this wouldve happened said menerva ramos a 
niece of mercados 
i expected justice to be done here this afternoon and i see 
there wasnt no justice said pedro soto one of mercados 
stepsons 
mayor xavier suarez blamed poverty for the uprising and promised 
to bring more city money to one of its poorest neighborhoods 
these things have a tendency to repeat themselves and i guess 
miamis now gotten in this rut said former mayor maurice ferre

saying it would allow almost 3300 soviets stranded in iraq to 
leave but it demanded the kremlin pay compensation for canceling 
their work contracts 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze had warned that 
moscow which has not sent troops to join the usled

request from former boxing great ali 
desptte iraqs refusal to allow most westerners to leave iraq 
and kuwait senate democrats insisted monday that the sanctions be 
given more time to work

worked said nunn who has criticized the presidents decision to 
increase the number of us troops in the region from 240000 to 
more than 440000 by midjanuary iraq has stationed an estimated 
430000 soldiers in southern iraq and kuwait 
but cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff told senate hearings monday that saddam could survive the 
embargo 
given the nature of the regime given saddam husseins 
brutality to his own people his very tight control of that 
society his ability to allocate resources for the military their 
ability to produce their own food he can ride them out 
cheney said 
but iraq insisted monday the sanctions were working

us agencies acted in a grossly negligent 
and unacceptable manner by failing to investigate terrorism as 
a possible cause of a plane crash that killed 256 americans most 
of them soldiers a congressional report said today 
the aftermath of the 1985 crash in gander newfoundland was 
marked by a neartotal absence of us participation in the 
canadian probe of the tragedy said the study by the staff of the 
house judiciary subcommittee on crime 
we found no evidence that there was an investigation of 
possible terrorism by either the united states or canada added 
the report which formed the basis for a subcommittee hearing 
today 
incredibly no us government agency or at least none with 
official responsibility demonstrated any determination to find out 
just what caused the crash subcommittee chairman william hughes 
dnj said at the hearing 
the national transportation safety board and other agencies 
of the us government chose to sit back and watch as the canadian 
efforts became embroiled in controversy hughes said 
the ntsb routinely rubberstamped the canadian findings 
without comment hughes added 
the canadian air safety board found by a 54 vote that icing of 
the wings was the most probable cause but a subsequent canadian 
review found that ice had not been the cause the us national 
transportation safety board nonetheless supported the original 
finding blaming it on ice 
the ntsb was grossly negligent and was not acting in the 
publics interest for taking such a position said the 
congressional report it appears that the ntsb was predisposed to 
not find fault 
fbi agents sent to gander the day of the crash apparently 
waited in a motel for whatever reports or conclusions 
canadian authorities saw fit to share with them said the staff 
report which has not been voted on by subcommittee members 
after 36 hours the fbi agents accepted a declaration that 
terrorism was not involved and returned home apparently without 
getting any evidence to bolster that conclusion it added 
such a course of conduct on the part of the fbi is 
unacceptable if not also unbelievable the report contended 
spokesmen for the ntsb and fbi declined comment both agencies 
were sending representatives to testify at the hearing 
the dc8 jetliner crashed on dec 12 1985 less than 30 seconds 
after liftoff from the airport at gander 
the chartered flight operated by miamibased arrow air was 
carrying soldiers from the 101st airborne division home from 
peacekeeping duties in egypts sinai peninsula 
rep robin tallon dsc has said the crash could be connected 
to the irancontra affair he suggests the plane may have been the 
target of a terrorist attack as a reprisal stemming from irans 
unhappiness with a weapons shipment authorized by the reagan 
administration less than three weeks earlier 
fueling the notion of a terrorist act 
eyewitnesses claim to have seen a bright orange object in the 
sky at the time of the crash 
shortly after the plane went down in gander an anonymous 
caller said that islamic jihad a proiranian terrorist group had 
put a bomb on the plane 
a pathologist found that lethal levels of carbon monoxide and 
hydrogen cyanide in many of the victims bodies had been inhaled 
before death as would be the case in a preimpact fire

us military spokesmen denied 
today that american troops were prohibited from displaying the us 
flag on their uniforms to avoid offending the saudi government 
they said that in a recent incident the commanding officer of a 
florida national guard unit had asked his troops to remove the flag 
in error the officer his unit and the date of the incident were 
not identified 
all troops bound for saudi arabia are briefed on the cultural 
sensitivities in the strict moslem nation which bans the mingling 
of the sexes in public and bars alcohol in the past strong ties 
with the united states have never been emphasized publicly because 
of washingtons links to israel 
one military spokesman said that some commanding officers take 
the warnings further than the regulations 
in trying not to offend someone in being sensitive they 
err on the side of caution said capt mike sherman of the us 
militarys joint information bureau it was just a bad word that 
the commanding officer got the military said a similar false 
report that letters mailed with stamps showing the american flag 
would not be delivered had swept through military ranks earlier 
this year 
us military positions in saudi arabia are barred from flying 
the american flag according to a policy by the central command in 
riyadh 
they are encampments rather than bases on the sovereign 
territory of saudi arabia said lt commander david knox a 
spokesman for central command 
it would not be appropriate to fly the flag implying that the 
area was under american control he said and is standard military 
policy worldwide 
troops may however display the flag on the walls of their 
living quarters in offices on their uniforms or anywhere else if 
their commanding officer approves he said 
knox said he was unaware of any saudi concern over such displays 
of the stars and stripes

the head of polands powerful roman 
catholic church has made clear that believers should vote for lech 
walesa in the presidential runoff election a newspaper reported 
today 
cardinal jozef glemp asked about challenger stanislaw 
tyminskis claim saturday of church support said in rome that the 
communique on sundays election issued recently by polish bishops 
gave no ground for that interpretation the zycie warszawy daily 
reported 
nobody believes that glemp said he said the bishops spoke 
for continuity in the direction of independence and freedom that 
has been outlined for the last 10 years 
glemps words leave us without doubt zycie warszawy said in 
a related commentary they fully uphold support for lech walesa 
in these short words the highest moral authority expressed a clear 
and decided message 
it added that the church speaks so clearly only at moments 
decisive for the future of the country 
in a country where more than 90 percent of the people consider 
themselves catholic the church endorsement should carry great 
weight and could be fatal for tyminskis comefromnowhere 
presidential bid 
the bishops issued their statement friday from the jasna gora 
monastery in czestochowa telling poles they should elect someone 
who would continue and consolidate the course of reforms and 
discover anew the meaning of solidarity 
it was read in all churches sunday and at least some pastors 
were reported to have added their own private instructions to vote 
for walesa 
in the first round of the elections nov 25 in which tyminski 
placed second among six candidates he did particularly well among 
rural voters 
but in the polish countryside the pastor often plays a pivotal 
role in advising the largely closedoff population about public 
affairs so a clear endorsement of walesa should help the 
solidarity chairman 
on nationwide television saturday night tyminski said i read 
the bishops letter and i think it was support for my candidacy 
because i am also striving to end this totalitarian system 
asked at a news conference today whether the church was 
supporting walesa tyminskis peruvian wife graciela answered 
this is between mr walesa and mr tyminski where is his 
walesas plan for the future of the country 
forget about the church she said 
public opinion polls show walesa leading tyminski by a 2to1 
margin 
however tyminski said at the news conference that he believes 
in his own polls which he said put walesas support at 50 percent 
and his at 44 percent he added that he is gaining about 15 
percentage points daily 
tyminski a selfproclaimed millionaire returned to poland in 
september after 21 years in canada and peru he has promised to 
quickly end the countrys economic crisis using his 
westernacquired business savvy

gogh committed himself toward the end of his troubled life the 
actress bought it in 1963 for about 165000

van gogh was about 57 million paid for a portrait of dr 
gachet in may

economic climate was partly responsible for the failure of miss 
taylors painting to reach the minimum price but added there is 
still a strong art market

president kenneth kaunda today announced 
the dismissals of his defense minister and the veteran chief 
editors of zambias two staterun daily newspapers 
the editors both of whom held their posts for more than 10 
years had sometimes been criticized for not reflecting the line of 
the ruling united national independence party 
kaundas party has been the only lawful one since 1973 but he 
has promised multiparty elections next year 
the president who announced the dismissals at a news 
conference gave no reason for them 
he said the defense minister lt gen hannaniah lungu would be 
replaced by his deputy dodson siatalimi lungu appointed defense 
chief in july after helping to crush a coup attempt will probably 
be transferred to the foreign service kaunda said lungu was 
previously commander of the air force 
the fired editors are komani kachinga of the times of zambia and 
cyrus sikazwe of the zambia daily mail they said they were 
surprised by the move but expressed no resentment 
under mounting pressure from trade union leaders academics 
students and former political loyalists kaunda recently agreed torewrite 
the constitution and restore the kind of westernstyle 
democracy he inherited from britain at independence in 1964 
but the 66yearold leader has ordered the two dailies as well 
as state television and radio not to report on opposition 
activities 
kaunda named two academics to replace the editors and some 
analysts suggested their lack of journalism experience might make 
it easier for the government to shape the coverage according to its 
own wishes 
an opposition newspaper the sunday express which was to have 
been launched this week did not appear on the streets after a 
state company refused to print it the paper has since found a 
private printer the publishers said

police said they arrested 100 demonstrators when 
a protest against the federal centers for disease controls 
definition of aids turned destructive 
they were allowed to demonstrate until they began defacing cdc 
property said dekalb county police maj js wilson they 
painted the building they beat on the windows and chained 
themselves to the front entry doors 
the protesters contend the health agencys aids definition costs 
women health benefits by failing to include some gynecological 
conditions that afflict women infected with the aids virus 
the aids coalition to unleash power said 700 people from 30 
states participated in the demonstration police estimated the 
crowd at 300 
about 100 were arrested for criminal trespass and a variety of 
other charges police said 
the protesters wearing placards depicting skulls marched in 
the rain through the emory university campus to the nearby cdc 
complex monday morning 
another group was detained after they invaded the cdc executive 
offices about three miles away wilson said 
act up said in a statement that the demonstration included 30 
women infected with hiv who spoke of how the outofdate 
definition based on the history of men diagnosed with aids excludes 
them 
of the 154917 people diagnosed with aids 14816 are women 
said cdc spokesman chuck fallis 
he said the agency was studying whether its a sign of aids or 
just a coincidence that some hivinfected women get diseases such 
as pelvic inflammatory disease and vaginal candidiasis 
we are continuing to look at this whole spectrum of aids in 
women including these gynecological conditions we may at some 
point expand our case definition but were not ready to do that at 
this point he said 
as for the protesters he said theyre saying that we are 
letting women die and that cdc doesnt care about the fate of 
women with hiv it seems rather absurd to me

the federal reserve in a move designed to 
ease the socalled credit crunch announced today it is 
eliminating bank reserve requirements on some deposits 
the board took action at this time in response to mounting 
evidence that commercial banks have been tightening their standards 
of creditworthiness and the terms and conditions for many types of 
loans the announcement said 
while much of this tightening has been welcome from a safety 
and soundness standpoint it has in recent months begun to exert a 
contractionary influence on the economy it added 
there currently is a 3 percent reserve requirement on 
nonpersonal time deposits maturing in less than 18 months which 
are mostly corporate cds and net eurocurrency liabilities the 
requirement means banks have to hold in reserve sums equal to 3 
percent of the amount 
both requirements will be lowered to zero in coming weeks 
the fed said lower reserve requirements reduce bank costs and 
provide incentives to lend to creditworthy borrowers thus 
countering to some extent the recent tightening in credit 
terms 
both federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and treasury 
secretary nicholas f brady have said tight credit is causing 
problems for many businesses 
some critics contend government officials are being overzealous 
in interpreting banking regulations in the wake of the savings and 
bond debacle brady has urged regulators not to be 
unrealistically negative in evaluating loans and urged bankers 
to keep lending to your good customers

president jose eduardo dos santos called 
today for sweeping economic and political reforms and told his 
ruling popular movement for the liberation of angola its 
15yearold oneparty rule will soon be over 
dos santos told 700 popular movement delegates the partys third 
congress that opened today will be the last under a singleparty 
system 
in a 30minute speech interrupted by frequent applause dos 
santos said the popular movement must abandon its marxist economic 
model to embrace the free market and a new strategy of democratic 
socialism 
the sixday congress is scheduled to debate proposals for 
reforming the centralized economy and introducing multiparty 
democracy 
delegates will also discuss ongoing peace talks with usbacked 
unita rebels to end a 15yearold civil war that has devastated 
what is potentially one of africas richest economies 
after a fifth round of peace talks between the two sides last 
month portuguese government mediators said they were close to a 
ceasefire 
dos santos said today that political advances will be difficult 
while the war continues with unita the portuguese acronym for the 
national union for the total independence of angola 
he has said plans to introduce a multiparty system will go ahead 
early next year even without an agreement with the rebels 
peace talks are expected to resume in january 
dos santos criticized the centrally planned economic system 
followed by the popular movement since angolas independence from 
portugal in 1975 the inadequacy of the system is showing in an 
economic asphyxiation because of the high level of collectivism of 
the means of production and services he said 
angola is rich in minerals and agricultural land but the war 
has crippled economic activity and severed communications only 
exports from the heavilyguarded northwestern oil fields have kept 
the economy afloat 
dos santos faces resistance to his reform plans from party 
hardliners 
observers in luanda said opposition to some planned changes may 
delay their discussion until a special party congress early next 
year 
dos santos hopes to strengthen his hand at the current congress 
in elections for members of the policymaking central committee and 
a new position of party general secretary 
expected to win the post is dos santos special assistant and 
leading reformer lopo de nascimento

a woman who sued price waterhouse for sex 
discrimination won another round today in her bid to be made a 
partner in the accounting firm and receive back pay 
the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
upheld a lower courts order that anne hopkins be made a partner of 
price waterhouse and that she receive 371000 in back pay 
the ruling stems from an important 1989 supreme court decision 
that employers have the burden or proving they did not discriminate 
when there is evidence of bias 
the high courts decision in the hopkins case came after she 
presented evidence that she was denied a partnership because male 
partners felt she acted too much like a man 
the supreme court sent the case back to us district judge 
gerhard a gesell who last may ordered price waterhouse to make 
ms hopkins a partner in its washingtonbased management consulting 
group 
the appellate court decision upheld gesells finding that price 
waterhouse failed to prove that it denied ms hopkins a partnership 
for a nondiscriminatory reason 
the appellate panel said it found no merit in price 
waterhouses appeal of gesells order

sales of new homes decreased another 35 
percent in october falling to a level not seen since the last 
recession the government said today 
sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491000 the 
departments of commerce and housing and urban development said in a 
joint release 
that was the lowest since 480000 new homes were sold in october 
1982 a month before the 198182 recession ended 
the housing industry has been in a slump for about two years 
because of high interest rates and home prices and more recently 
fading consumer confidence in the economy 
during the first 10 months of this year new home sales were off 
158 percent from the same period of 1989 sales fell in eight of 
those 10 months including a 4 percent drop in september and a 2 
percent decline in august 
the september figure was revised down from 6 percent in the 
departments initial estimate but the october total was worse than 
the 18 percent drop first reported 
at the october sales pace it would take 84 months to exhaust 
the inventory of unsold homes up from 83 months in september and 
eight months in august there was a seven month supply of unsold 
homes in october 1989 
the effects of the sluggishness were seen in the labor 
departments employment report for october it said 185000 
construction jobs have been lost in the last five months including 
80000 in october alone 
existing home sales also have been weak slumping 47 percent in 
october to an annual rate of 302 million their lowest level since 
early 1985 according to the national association of realtors 
but despite the weakness new home prices continued to rise in 
october 
the government reported the median price jumped 79 percent to 
121800 while the average price advanced 98 percent to 
157500 the median means half of the homes cost more half less 
a year ago the median price was 123000 and the average 
147800 
sales in the northeast which tumbled to a recent low of 57000 
units in september rebounded 474 percent in october to an annual 
rate of 84000 units 
sales fell 182 percent to 112000 units in the west the 
lowest since 106000 homes were sold in september 1982 in the 
midwest sales were off 117 percent to 83000 units the lowest 
since 74000 homes were sold in august 1986 
sales dropped 41 percent in the south to 212000 units

the navy today announced it is forcing the 
chief of the naval air systems command to retire early because he 
failed to inform top pentagon officials of serious flaws in the 
proposed a12 stealth bomber program 
vice adm richard c gentz will retire no later than feb 1 
1991 the pentagon said 
the a12 program executive officer rear adm john f calvert 
and the program manager capt lawrence g elberfeld have also 
been reassigned to other duties and received letters of censure 
from navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii 
garrett informed defense secretary dick cheney of the actions in 
a memo released by the pentagon today 
the navy secretary told cheney he acted on the basis of an 
internal navy inquiry into the a12 program which is a year behind 
schedule and at least 1 billion over its anticipated development 
budget of 48 billion 
the a12 a classified program is the navys top priority for 
future aircraft development the carrierbased airplane is 
scheduled to enter operation in 1995 
the navy inquiry said a key failure of the senior navy officers 
responsible for overseeing the a12 program was their unwillingness 
to pass on negative news about the projects problems to higher 
officials and to top pentagon civilian leaders 
copies of a report of the navy inquirys conclusions as well as 
a separate report on the a12 program by the pentagon inspector 
general also were released today 
the inspector generals report was highly critical of the role 
of john a betti the under secretary of defense for acquisition 
it said he put too much credence in assurances by the contractors 
that the project could be completed on time and within the cost 
ceiling and that he dismissed warnings by lowerlevel pentagon 
officials that the project was encountering serious problems 
we find mr bettis failure especially troublesome in view of 
a prior warning within the office of the secretary of defense of 
cost growth on the a12 program susan j crawford the inspector 
general wrote in a letter to rep andy ireland rfla 
ireland a member of the house armed services committee said in 
a statement released today that the inspector generals report 
illustrated a fundamental flaw in the pentagons system of 
assigning responsibility for weapons development 
program managers are giving assurances about contractors 
adherence to budgets based largely on the word of the contractors 
themselves he wrote it is a process ripe for abuse

three star trackers in the instrument pointing system finally 
appeared to be working well 
one of the trackers still needed more finetuning said flight 
director bob castle nevertheless the crew started using the 
automatic pointing system and reported it was steady as a rock 
mission scientist ted gull said it would be several days before 
the observatory is working at 100 percent as a result targets 
of low priority will be dropped he said 
were really in a stage where the observatory is really 
starting to come alive gull said its a lot later than where 
we wanted to be but i see no major showtoppers 
by manually operating the system the astronauts were able to 
look briefly at star clusters early today and a distant galaxy and 
two stars monday more than 10 percent of the shuttle missions 230 
planned observations will have to be scrapped because of the 
earlier problems in aligning three of the astro observatorys four 
telescopes gull said 
astronaut jeffrey hoffman spotted space station mir through 
binoculars late this morning and said it appeared as a small point 
of light mir was orbiting 32 miles above columbia with four 
cosmonauts and a japanese television reporter 
the 10day mission which began with liftoff early sunday was 
already six months behind schedule because of five launch 
postponements four of them caused by hydrogen leaks in columbia 
and one by problems with astro 
observatory repairs were delayed for a few hours monday when a 
computer aboard columbia malfunctioned after a faulty message was 
included in a series of commands from earth after the computer 
crash one of the three star trackers failed to return to operating 
condition nasa said 
the astronauts got some viewing time in monday and today by 
manually operating the system and by aligning the three ultraviolet 
telescopes with the help of a fourth star tracker normally used to 
keep the shuttle aligned 
that process is awkward timeconsuming and not as precise but 
it enabled the astronauts to focus one of the telescopes today on 
two merged star clusters each of which has 100000 to 1 million 
stars all three telescopes pointed on a nearby star monday 
evening 
that is a milestone how about that said hoffman 
to operate the system manually overnight parker used a 
joystick or paddle and astronaut ron parise typed onto a computer 
keyboard 
give me a paddle and a telescope and i can move the 
universe parker joked 
on monday the astronauts manually pointed all three telescopes 
at a white dwarf star with a powerful magnetic field 
the astronauts also pointed one telescope at a galaxy 60 million 
light years away to look for evidence of a black hole the 
observation lasted only a few seconds instead of a half hour 
because of the imprecise manual operation 
were seeing some science were very confident about the 
instruments mission manager jack jones said 
its enough to tell us the telescope is working great and 
were excited about how well were going to do once the instrument 
pointing system starts pointing said arthur davidsen of johns 
hopkins the telescopes principal investigator 
columbias mission mission is the first in five years dedicated 
entirely to scientific research 
astros xray telescope was unaffected by the trouble since it 
has its own pointing system it was expected to start making 
scientific observations once it was calibrated 
scientists want to use the observatory to study xrays and 
ultraviolet rays emitted from highenergy objects those rays 
cannot penetrate earths atmosphere 
astro which is in the shuttles cargo bay is expected to look 
at stars quasars galaxies jupiter a supernova and comet levy 
columbia was supposed to carry astro into orbit in march 1986 
the flight was delayed indefinitely by the challenger accident two 
months earlier

a group of czechoslovak soldiers 
mailed themselves packages of explosives they stole from a military 
warehouse apparently to make fireworks for new years eve a 
newspaper said tuesday 
the contents of the packages were discovered when one parcel was 
accidentally damaged by the post office the newspaper said

stole with four other soldiers the report said 
the seven were soon to finish their military service and mailed 
the ammunition to their home addresses in five packages apparently 
to make fireworks out of them for new years eve

a bulldozer roared into the ruined 
minestrewn former urban battleground in the heart of beirut on 
tuesday to remove the fortifications and rubble of 15 years of 
civil war 
stray dogs emerged from shellshattered buildings barking 
furiously as the huge yellow machine began demolishing an earth 
embankment that split the chrisian and moslem sectors of the 
capital 
martyrs square and surrounding streets the former business 
center of beirut were part of the no mans land that became 
overgrown with bushes and small trees sprouting from cracks in 
pavement 
two small antipersonnel mines exploded under the bulldozers 
chains as it went to work the bulldozer was not affected by the 
small blasts but a lebanese army captain ordered work stopped 
until troops cleared the area 
luckily there were no antitank mines planted in this part of 
the green line said an army captain referring to the 
demarcation line that once divided the city such mines would 
have wrecked the bulldozer 
the army deployed in downtown beirut on monday in the first 
phase of a government plan to reunify the capital and end the civil 
warfare that has killed more than 150000 people 
the area around martyrs square just north of the port of beirut 
was the scene of some of the wars most savage battles as christian 
and moslem militias clashed repeatedly for control 
the crumbling facades of the old multistory buildings fronting 
on the square are peppered with bullet and shellholes their 
interiors gutted by fire and shells 
a rusty popcorn machine scarred with bullet and shrapnel holes 
stood on the sidewalk outside the roxy movie theater beneath a sign 
proclaiming nonstop showings 
another small sign on the first floor of the roxy building also 
full of bullet holes said music lessons for 30 pounds a month 
i wonder if they will teach music here again anyway it wont 
be for 30 pounds a month said the army captain who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the civil war shattered lebanons booming economy the lebanese 
pound once the most stable currency in the middle east fell from 
its prewar value of 25 to the us dollar to 1250 to the dollar 
in august 
the currency began regaining strength after the rival sides 
accepted an arab leaguebrokered peace plan requiring them to 
withdraw from beirut as the first step in a pacification program 
the militia withdrawal started last month and was considered 
completed in the greater beirut area monday 
on tuesday the lebanese pound traded at 690 to the dollar 
despite the withdrawal of most militiamen armed troops of the 
lebanese forces militia of christian warlord samir geagea remained 
in control of the port area of beirut they prevented reporters 
from entering the area saying they had not been ordered to 
withdraw 
a source at geageas headquarters who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the lebanese forces men would be withdrawn from the 
port area as part of a plan to return control of all lebanese ports 
to the government 
there are 12 ports now held by various militias and the 
government plans to retake control of them after the unification of 
beirut 
later the peace plan calls for disbanding the christian and 
moslem militias and imposing government authority nationwide

there was once another bagdad along 
another oilrich gulf facing us troops 
it was a boomtown border port at the mouth of the rio grande a 
city of 10000 that thrived by exporting confederate tobacco and 
cotton evading the union blockade of southern ports 
in 1866 after the civil war mexican officials were fighting 
for control of the town and one faction invited 1000 american 
soldiers from the other side of the river to help 
but the soldiers stayed for 20 days of looting a debacle that 
got their commander imprisoned when he returned to the united 
states 
the sack was so total it was as if bagdad had been taken from 
one side of the river to the other says mexicos porrua 
encyclopedia 
the iraqi capital baghdad also has suffered its share of 
sacks the mongols raped and pillaged in 1258 tamerlanes 
followers repeated in 1400 and the persians took their turn in 
1524 
like those attacks the sack of bagdad mexico failed to crush 
the town it took a hurricane in 1880 and changing trade patterns 
to do that 
there isnt much on either side of the river today a 
windblasted vista of shoehigh scrub dry lakes damp lakes and 
marshes a few fishermens shacks and a few stands of trees each 
visible for miles 
the only us forces in evidence are the border patrolmen who 
run an occasional launch up the river according to ismael perez a 
fisherman who has lived in what was bagdad for 12 years 
perez who had wandered over with silberio duenas to help a 
stranger push his car out of a small bog said he sometimes found 
old bottles or coins a few old building stones in the area 
but no monuments not even any eroded walls bear witness to the 
notquitesplendor that was bagdad 
why the place was named for the great arab capital is a 
mystery nobody has been able to solve said matamoros historian 
andres cuellar its extremely odd 
he said one theory is that one of bagdads founders was inspired 
by thousand and one nights which tells the story of an arab 
sailor named sindbad who sets out on adventures from baghdad 
even in its heyday bagdad lacked the golden domes and tiled 
spires of the iraqi capitals mosques the twisting alley ways of 
mud brick houses the brutal ottoman intrigue of its politics to 
say nothing of any arabs 
but both are deadly flat save for a few sand dunes in the 
mexican town and both are graced by a river although the rio 
grande resembles the puny jordan river more than baghdads mighty 
tigris 
cuellar said bagdad was born when the authorities sought to stop 
goods from disappearing between the ships offshore and the customs 
house in matamoros 20 miles inland they decided to put the tax 
collector where the imports met the shore 
today some people in matamoros go blank when asked about the 
city that once rivaled their own as a center of northern trade 
some people say there was a bagdad but its now under the 
waters of the sea said a soda pop vender in downtown matamoros 
when asked for directions to the site 
for perez and his fellow fishermen here the conflict in the 
persian gulf seems just as remote 
asked about the other baghdad he at first speculated on a city 
in texas 
we dont have a radio here he said there is nothing here 
but air

house speaker thomas s foley today dashed any 
hopes for a proposed change in house rules that would have 
bolstered the democratic majority in 1992 
the house democratic caucus had been scheduled to vote on a 
proposed rule change that would let lawmakers accept unlimited 
donations to cover legal costs they may incur in the upcoming 
redistricting 
but foley dwash emerged from the meeting to tell reporters 
it will not happen were going to review the situation 
boundaries of congressional districts will be changed nationwide 
as a result of the 1990 census because the changes could 
critically affect many 1992 house races key redistricting plans 
could wind up being settled in the courts 
rep martin frost dtexas who heads a democratic group that is 
reviewing house rules and making suggestions for changes said 
before todays vote the likelihood is high that a number of 
members would want legal advice 
foley in quashing the idea provided no other details on the 
issue which when first disclosed on monday attracted criticism 
fred wertheimer president of common cause said his citizens 
group was urging house democrats to reject the proposal which he 
said runs counter to public demand for tighter ethics rules 
its as if no one there is paying any attention to the keating 
five hearings going on across the street in the other chamber 
said wertheimer referring to the senate ethics hearings on 
allegations of influencepeddling in the savings and loan scandal 
the proposed rule change would create an outrageous loophole 
at a time when the house should be taking steps to eliminate the 
ability of outside interest groups to provide money to elected 
officials who decide their interests wertheimer said 
normally house rules limit gifts to members to 200 under 
frosts proposal that rule would be waived for any donations for 
legal costs associated with redistricting in addition federal 
election law limits on campaign donations would not apply 
lawmakers would have to report contributions and spending from 
their special redistricting accounts the reporting would be done 
as part of congress annual financial disclosure process which 
allows a lag of up to 1 years before a transaction must be 
reported 
another leadership proposal to help incumbents would change the 
rules in the taxpayerfinanced house recording studio which 
lawmakers use to make prerecorded messages to their home 
districts 
lawmakers now must pay studio costs from their office accounts 
the new proposal would let them accept private reimbursement for 
those expenses thus freeing more office account money for mass 
mailings and other purposes 
decisions on the rules changes were coming a day after the 
democrats and republicans reelected their leadership teams from 
the last congress 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo told the 
democrats they faced the challenge of improving the reputation 
and credibility of this institution 
gephardt and foley were chosen without opposition by the 
democrats to continue in their posts as were majority whip william 
h gray dpa and caucus chairman steny hoyer dmd 
on the republican side minority leader robert michel of 
illinois and minority whip newt gingrich of georgia had no 
opponents 
but while the democrats were pursuing advantage over the gop 
the republicans were fighting among themselves monday 
the no 3ranked republican conference chairman jerry lewis of 
california had to survive a vigorous challenge by rep carl 
pursell of michigan and rep guy vander jagt of michigan held on 
to his chairmanship of the republican congressional campaign 
committee in a tough battle with rep don sundquist of tennessee

you want to be a part of it but when the show was going down in 
august we were a part of it for four months in the gulf we were 
very busy he said

iran has executed more than 5000 people in the 
past three years many for political beliefs and the government 
has done little to stem human rights abuses amnesty international 
said today 
despite some changes since the 1989 death of ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini government critics continued to be arrested and tortured 
some for no more than signing a letter criticizing lack of human 
rights and freedoms the international human rights group said in a 
report 
amnesty quoted exprisoners as saying a death commission of 
iranian officials chose prisoners every day and sent them to their 
deaths after a cursory interrogation if their views were not 
acceptable 
in 1988 more than 2500 political prisoners were killed 
secretly in a few months on orders of the commission the 
londonbased organization said 
thousands more have been executed after summary trials in which 
they were convicted of criminal offenses amnesty said crackdowns 
on drug trafficking led to more than 1100 executions in 1989 it 
said 
most criminal executions are by hanging but some people are 
beheaded forced to jump from high places or stoned to death while 
buried to the waist amnesty said 
a photo in the report shows the bodies of nine men hanging from 
a crane on the back of a truck 
the report says that after executions these portable gibbets may 
be driven through the streets with the bodies still hanging from 
them 
the united nations is considering a draft resolution condemning 
rights violations in iran based on findings of its salvadoran 
envoy reynaldo galindo pohl he noted abuses of due process and a 
startling number of executions 
iran on monday persuaded the un general assembly to delete all 
references in the resolution to executions illtreatment and 
torture in return it pledged to continue cooperating with un 
human rights investigations and to begin letting the red cross 
visit its prisons 
a vote on the original draft resolution would have been a 
humiliating public rebuke for iran which undoubtedly would have 
refused to allow future visits by human rights experts 
tehran radio on monday accused the united nations of using the 
original draft resolution to try to pressure iran into dropping its 
opposition to usled forces arrayed against iraq in the persian 
gulf region 
the actions of amnesty international and the human rights 
commission of the united nations tell of a vast calculated 
political pressure whose roots should be searched outside the 
framework of human rights the radio said 
amnesty said the iranian government has consistently refused to 
answer the groups questions and ignored its requests to send a 
delegation 
despite changes brought by the 1988 end of irans war with iraq 
and the death of khomeini the government has done little to 
improve human rights protection the report says 
amnesty which opposes the death penalty said people are often 
executed days after their arrest with no legal counsel no right to 
call witnesses and no right to appeal 
torture beating and intimidation of prisoners is reportedly 
widespread the organization said 
more than 20 prominent government critics including several 
exministers were arrested in june after they supported an open 
letter to president hashemi rafsanjani criticizing lack of freedoms 
and human rights amnesty said 
the group expressed fears the imprisoned critics were being 
tortured to extract confessions of involvement in socalled 
counterrevolutionary activity 
executions for criminal offenses are usually announced in the 
iranian press but political executions are usually carried out in 
secret the report says for this reason the numbers of political 
executions which have taken place in iran are disputed 
but amnesty has recorded the names of over 2000 prisoners 
reportedly executed in secret from july 1988 to january 1989 
there is overwhelming evidence that in the latter part of 1988 
the iranian government carried out the largest wave of political 
executions in iran since the early 1980s it said 
after the iranian revolution of 1979 which ousted shah reza 
pahlavi and brought khomeini to power thousands of political 
opponents were executed 
amnesty said former prisoners suggested the 198889 executions 
might have resulted from two factors 
the ceasefire in the war with iraq which distracted 
international attention from the prisoners 
government reprisal for an armed incursion by an iraqbased 
mujahedeen khalq or peoples holy warriors opposition group

a physician who hooked a woman to a 
machine that let her take her life with the press of a button was 
charged with murder by a prosecutor who said the switch did not 
relieve the doctor of responsibility 
dr jack kevorkian known as dr death for his invention 
helped a 54yearold woman with alzheimers disease use the machine 
to inject herself with a fatal dose of an anesthetic and a 
heartstopping drug on june 4 
dr kevorkian was the primary and legal cause of janet adkins 
death he cannot avoid his criminal culpability by the clever use 
of a switch oakland county prosecutor richard thompson said 
monday 
kevorkian a 62yearold retired pathologist from royal oak 
faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole if 
convicted 
i dont take this seriously said kevorkian who has 
advocated doctorassisted suicide what happens to me is 
immaterial the time has come for this thing 
the charges came one day before a hearing today to determine 
whether kevorkians confiscated machine should be returned to him 
kevorkians attorney geoffrey fieger today told judge alice l 
gilbert the state has no right to keep the suicide device because 
michigan has no specific law against assisted suicide 
the lawyers then met privately in gilberts chambers when the 
hearing resumed prosecutors attempted to put kevorkian on the 
stand the doctors attorneys said he wouldnt testify and the 
judge adjourned the hearing until monday 
mrs adkins and her husband traveled from portland ore to 
michigan to meet kevorkian because the state is one of the few that 
do not explicitly make it a crime to help someone commit suicide 
she had been diagnosed with alzheimers which robs people of their 
memories ability to function and eventually their lives 
an autopsy confirmed mrs adkins had alzheimers disease but 
she was not in the terminal stages of illness and was not in any 
pain thompson said 
for me not to charge dr kevorkian would turn oakland county 
into the suicide mecca of our nation he said 
the prosecutor said he based the firstdegree murder charge on a 
1920 michigan supreme court decision in that case a man who mixed 
poison and placed it near his wife at her request was found guilty 
of murder 
the legislature is considering a bill that would it a crime 
punishable by up to four years in prison and a 2000 fine to help 
someone commit suicide 
fieger said because michigan has no law against medically 
assisted suicide he didnt expect the case to come to trial 
this is not a crime recognized in the state of michigan he 
said 
kevorkian was arraigned and freed on 150000 bail a 
preliminary hearing was set for dec 12 
ronald adkins mrs adkins husband said he had no immediate 
comment on the charges the couple had belonged to the hemlock 
society a eugene ore organization that promotes death on demand 
for the terminally ill 
derek humphry executive director of the society this will be 
quite a job getting a conviction because the law in michigan is 
extremely ambiguous

president bush said today he doubts 
that iraqs saddam hussein has gotten the message of a united 
nations resolution authorizing force unless he gets out of kuwait 
by midjanuary 
during a joint news conference appearance here with uruguayan 
president luis alberto lacalle bush reiterated that he would not 
allow talks with the iraqi leader and foreign minister tariq aziz 
to get into the palestinian issue and israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip 
bush also said that i dont agree with former topranking 
us military commanders who testified at congressional hearings 
that economic sanctions against iraq should be given considerably 
more time to work 
ive not been one whose been convinced that sanctions alone 
will bring him to his senses bush said although he said 
theyre having some effect 
of saddam the president said i am convinced that up until 
now at least he has not gotten the message and the united 
nations resolution speaks for itself 
to me it was loud and clear he said but i dont think 
saddam hussein yet understands that and so the best hope for peace 
is for him to understand that all means necessary to fulfill these 
resolutions will be used against him and i hope he understands 
that 
bush announced last week that he was sending secretary of state 
james a baker iii to baghdad to meet with saddam sometime late 
this month or in early january and that he would receive aziz for 
talks at the white house 
but the president said these meetings would not constitute 
negotiations with iraqs leaders but would merely represent bushs 
lastditch political effort to get saddam to withdraw iraqi forces 
from kuwait 
im not in a negotiating mood or anything of that nature he 
said today 
in washington senate democrats have repeatedly urged bush to 
stick with the economic embargo 
sen sam nunn dga made the point repeatedly during five days 
of hearings that he engineered as chairman of the senate armed 
services committee day after day former us defense officials 
urged the white house to give the sanctions more time bolstering 
the democratic challenge to bushs strategy 
when two current officials defense secretary dick cheney and 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff finally 
testified on monday nunn asked them if the administration was 
dismissing sanctions too easily 
if we go to war we never will know whether they would have 
worked said nunn who has criticized the presidents decision to 
increase the number of us troops in the region to more than 
440000 
cheney and powell struck a pessimistic tone saying that saddam 
could ride out the international sanctions imposed after his forces 
invaded the oilrich emirate of kuwait on aug 2 
they also used their appearances before the panel to try to stem 
the tide of congressional discontent over bushs conduct 
given the nature of the regime given saddam husseins 
brutality to his own people his very tight control of that 
society his ability to allocate resources for the military their 
ability to produce their own food he can ride them out 
cheney said 
he described the administration position that american and 
international interests are in jeopardy in the crisis especially 
if saddam gains a stranglehold on oil supplies 
the defense secretary also said he does not believe bush 
requires any additional authority from congress before committing 
us forces to achieve our objectives in the persian gulf 
in a washington postabc news poll released monday nine out of 
10 people approved of bushs offer to send baker to baghdad for 
talks with saddam 
while 90 percent of the 758 adults selected at random for the 
poll said they supported the decision to send baker to baghdad 53 
percent said they didnt think it would do any good 
the poll conducted by telephone last friday and saturday also 
found that 69 percent approved of the un resolution authorizing 
the use of military force the poll has a likely margin of 
uncertainity of 4 percent either way

anwer siddiqui hates to miss a flight but 
this time he was grateful 
siddiqui 29 of atlanta had been scheduled to take northwest 
flight 1482 from detroit to pittsburgh on monday but his 
connecting flight from atlanta got a late start and delayed landing 
in detroit because of fog 
had we landed then i would have been on that flight and 
probably dead siddiqui said 
eight people aboard flight 1482 were killed and at least 20 
people were treated for burns broken bones smoke inhalation and 
other injuries after the dc9 collided with a boeing 727 on the 
runway at detroit metropolitan airport 
siddiqui and several others who had been scheduled to take the 
flight instead ended up on flight 1484 a later flight for various 
reasons they expressed relief monday night when their plane landed 
at greater pittsburgh international airport 
owen ballow 30 of detroit was traveling to pittsburgh on 
business for schneider usa inc of minneapolis a medical 
products company he said he owes one to his companys travel 
agent for dissuading him from his plan to board flight 1482 
the agent talked ballow out of taking the earlier flight because 
bad weather had delayed flights out of detroit and the terminal was 
crowded he ended up taking the same flight as siddiqui 
whey you fly if your number is up you lose ballow said 
fortunately it doesnt happen often but when you fly 
frequently it makes you think 
also on flight 1484 was mobay corp executive michael short of 
the pittsburgh suburb of mount lebanon he said he had tickets to 
fly on the burned plane but rescheduled his flight because of a 
lunch appointment 
im feeling pretty lucky he said i had a few drinks on 
the plane on the way home

public health officials are making it easier 
faster and cheaper for millions of women who suffer from vaginal 
yeast infections to get treatment 
with the availability soon of the first overthecounter drug to 
treat these infections women will be able to skip the doctors 
office and go straight to the pharmacy and pay less than when it 
was a prescription drug 
were delighted said cindy pearson program director of the 
womens health network who testified in favor of the switch before 
an fda advisory committee the committee recommended the action the 
fda took monday 
weve had nothing but positive and enthusiastic support from 
our members for the fda action ms pearson said some want to 
give it the drug to their friends for christmas 
vaginal yeast infections afflict nearly threefourths of all 
women at least once in their lifetimes about 22 million cases are 
reported annually 
the drug that was approved for overthecounter use is 
clotrimazole which is sold under the trade name gynelotrimin by 
its maker schering plough healthcare products it will be sold 
over the counter at full prescription strength 
the company plans to begin shipping its nonprescription product 
on jan 2 and expects to have it on store shelves nationwide by the 
beginning of february said kristie egstrand product manager for 
gynelotrimin pharmacists cannot distribute their prescription 
supplies of the drug for overthecounter sales because they would 
not be labeled properly she said 
dr carl peck director of the fdas center for drug evaluation 
and research said the drug has been used safely for more than a 
decade is highly effective and has little risk 
gynelotrimin costs about 25 for a sevenday course of 
treatment when it is prescribed the overthecounter price will be 
in the range of 17 to 18 said company spokesman doug petkus 
ortho pharmaceuticals also is seeking fda approval to allow its 
antifungal product monistat to be sold without prescription said 
robert kniffin a spokesman for orthos parent corporation johnson 
amp johnson 
monistat is the leading prescription treatment for vaginal yeast 
infections with 59 percent of the market he said and another 
ortho product terazol is second in the market schering plough 
officials said gynelotrimin is third 
dr raquel arias a los angeles gynecologist who spoke at the 
companys news conference in new york on monday said the fdas 
decision which takes effect immediately will allow women to 
spend their health care dollars more effectively 
this is one of the most common things you see in practice 
she said it can be a significant disruptor of a womans 
lifestyle now theyll be able just to go to the store and get an 
effective treatment 
labeling on gynelotrimin will advise women experiencing vaginal 
itch and discomfort for the first time to see a physician for an 
accurate diagnosis 
but women who have had a yeast infection diagnosed by a health 
practitioner before know the symptoms itching and burning 
sometimes with a discharge and soreness these women can safely 
treat themselves the fda said 
vaginal yeast infection or candidiasis is an overgrowth of a 
naturally occurring fungus called candida the overabundance occurs 
when the bodys natural balance of bacteria is upset this often 
occurs with antibiotics or birth control pills diabetics also are 
subject to greater risk of recurring infections and warm weather 
can be a factor as well 
the symptoms though can be similar to those of other 
conditions including sexually transmitted diseases which is why a 
woman should get an initial diagnosis by a physician the fda said

a federal judge ruled today that court transcripts 
of tapes acquired by cnn containing prison conversations of manuel 
noriega should be made public but he didnt release them 
immediately 
us district judge william hoeveler issued the decision after 
four media organizations asked for access to the court documents 
last week saying the public had a right to know the factual basis 
of a case that tested the constitutional limits of prior restraint 
the judge said he would not release the transcripts until 
thursday to allow cnn time to appeal to the 11th us circuit court 
of appeals in atlanta 
cnn attorney terry bienstock said he did not immediately know 
whether the network would appeal 
bienstock argued earlier that releasing the transcripts would be 
an intrusion into the newsgathering and newsediting process 
 
in his 18page decision hoeveler chided cnn for first fighting 
to televise the tapes and then seeking to keep the transcripts from 
being used by other news organizations 
the judge said it comes as somewhat of a surprise to have cnn 
the forceful proponent of a free press operating without judicial 
intervention return to this court urging that the press and public 
be denied a right of access to the very information which cnn has 
argued is of immediate public interest 
hoeveler dismissed cnns contention that it owned the content of 
the tapes saying it was the us government that monitored 
noriegas prison conversations and recorded them not cnn 
karen kammer an attorney representing the four media 
organizations said she was pleased with the ruling the 
organizations are the miami herald the associated press 
postnewsweek station wplgtv of miami and gannett co inc and usa 
today which gannett owns 
i think the court has recognized that the content of the tapes 
does not belong to cnn as we had argued she said 
three weeks ago cnn revealed it had obtained seven tapes of 
phone calls made from noriegas prison cell near here federal 
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of 
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers and that all 
inmates are made aware of this practice 
the fallen panamanian dictators attorneys went into court nov 
8 after learning about the tapes and hoeveler ordered cnn not to 
play any that might interfere with attorneyclient privilege the 
network played some portions of the tapes for a day but withdrew 
them when a federal appeals court backed hoeveler 
the supreme court refused to intervene on a 72 vote forcing 
cnn to submit the tapes to the judge for review transcripts then 
were prepared by court officials in miami to aid hoeveler and 
attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents of the tapes 
last week hoeveler decided to allow cnn to broadcast the tapes 
and returned them to the network but they were not immediately 
aired 
cnn has not said where it got the tapes but noriegas attorneys 
said the tapes were released to the government of panama by the 
state department or the drug enforcement administration and that 
panama gave them to cnn 
noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking 46 million in 
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade

steve malarkey was a disgruntled computer 
technician looking for a career change when his cat leaped forward 
with an idea 
i was sitting in front of the tv with my wife watching a 
national geographic special on birds of the cayman islands or 
somewhere he said 
our cat stick who never even glanced at tv before came out 
of his box like a shot and sat right in front of the screen 
growling and meowing 
malarkey borrowed a friends video camera and tripod scattered 
birdseed and popcorn in his wooded backyard and recorded the antics 
of neighborhood birds squirrels and chipmunks that gathered for a 
noisy feast 
when i brought the tape back to the house and showed it to 
stick he went ballistic malarkey said he was in front of the 
tv behind the tv on top of the tv knocking things over and 
swiping at the screen 
nice kitty 
malarkey went into the cat business in a big way his 
video catnip a professional 25minute version of the same 
backyard scene is one of the hottest gift items to appear on pet 
store shelves this christmas season 
malarkey says hes sold 7000 copies since his video hit the 
market in september 1989 most of them in the past couple of 
months fewer than 10 tapes have been returned on behalf of 
dissatisfied feline viewers he said 
human viewers might find video catnip boring after a while 
theres just so much excitement in watching a pair of blue jays 
squabbling or a squirrel snitching a peanut from a bowl 
but malarkey who recently moved from this washington suburb to 
morgantown wva says its the purrfect stocking stuffer for the 
indoor cat who has everything 
steven spielberg it aint he said but we havent gotten 
any complaints yet from the cats 
the tape which retails for 1995 promises some 
cataclysmic fun with no paws in the action it starts with this 
warning 
while watching this video your cat may become excited and 
attempt to get inside your television set to get at the birds 
we strongly suggest that you remove all breakables from on top or 
around your tv set no kitting 
the live action is divided into segments titled cheep 
thrills mews and feather report and a stalk in the park 
which features plenty of closeup shots of kittys favorite 
creatures cavorting on the tv screen 
can cats really see a tv video 
veterinarians agree with malarkey that although cats dont 
discern shapes and colors as distinctly as humans they are acutely 
aware of moving figures and sounds that excite them 
malarkey says hes plowing the profits from video catnip 
into a series of sequels with bigger birds bigger squirrels 
maybe some sea gulls thrown in

an ambulance crew drove six hours on 
snowcovered highways to pick up a liver for a transplant patient 
after a storm prevented an airplane carrying the organ from 
landing

despite slippery roads and creeping traffic the ambulance 
delivered the liver allowing the transplant operation to get under 
way about seven hours later said pat crowley nursing supervisor 
at froedtert hospital in milwaukee 
the patient identified only as a 42yearold woman was in 
serious condition tuesday after receiving the liver of a 
24yearold man who died sunday in a car accident in alabama

moscow president mikhail s gorbachev told the soviet 
legislature today that he will crack down on black marketeering and 
boost food imports to feed the population during this 
shortageplagued winter 
he promised that his actions would guarantee the food supply to 
the nation for the next three or four months 
gorbachev also said his upcoming shakeup of the soviet cabinet 
would drastically shrink it aides said its membership would drop 
from 56 ministers to little more than a dozen 
the president presented draft constitutional amendments for 
revamping of the soviet government and won immediate approval of 
them by a vote of 28117 
the larger congress of peoples deputies which convenes dec 
17 also must ratify the amendments 
describing the rampant black market in food in the soviet union 
gorbachev said a survey of 50 state stores found that when they 
close they have a third shift when employees sell the food 
illegally 
salesclerks in soviet stores often set aside choice goods to 
sell at inflated prices so they can pocket the profits 
within the next two or three weeks we think we can control 
the situation he said referring to the black market 
gorbachev also said he had obtained loans and credits to import 
flour sugar vegetable oil margarine meat milk products and 
eggs 
during the first three months of 1991 he said the soviet 
government would spend the equivalent of 21 billion rubles on 
food including 
10 miliion tons of grain 19 million tons of sugar 156000 
tons of flour 277000 tons of sunflower oil 357000 tons of meat 
and meat products 45 million tons of milk products and 110000 
tons of groats 
the government also is stepping up its construction program for 
food processing and will set aside 12 million acres for 
individual farming to boost domestic production he said 
gorbachev did not specify what types of food processing 
industries would be built or whether the additional land for 
individual farming would actually be owned by private farmers or 
collective farms 
on monday the parliament of the russian federation approved a 
measure allowing private land ownership but the national 
legislature has not taken that step so far 
the united states germany and italy have begun sending food aid 
to the soviet union and other western and asian countries have 
pledged their support soviet officials blame problems with food 
distribution for increasingly empty grocery store shelves 
gorbachevs overhaul of his administrative structure would 
shrink the council of ministers and rename it the cabinet of 
ministers 
presidential spokesman vitaly ignatienko later said the new 
cabinet would have 12 to 15 members asked when the appointments 
would be made to the new body he said soon in our lifetime 
the cabinet of ministers would be responsible to the president 
and control the national budget energy industries transportation 
environmental protection as well as credit and foreign currency 
in conjunction with the republics it would work out a national 
program for health insurance maternity and child care issues 
culture and education and basic scientific research 
the cabinet would continue to include the prime ministers of the 
15 republics in addition to the federal officials the interfax 
news agency reported 
the federation council an advisory board representing the 15 
republics would be enhanced and take responsibility for carrying 
out the decisions that it approves 
this could ease gorbachevs authority problems by enlisting the 
republic presidents aid in carrying out kremlin decisions 
recently many republics have rejected orders from the central 
government 
the reform also calls for creating a vice presidency and a 
national security council it would abolish his presidential 
council itself only a few months old 
the national security council would maintain national defense 
maintenance of a reliable state economic and ecological 
security and handle natural disasters and emergencies interfax 
reported 
the 15 soviet republics would not have national security 
responsibilities 
the constitutional changes would preserve the post of prime 
minister to be nominated by the president and approved by the 
supreme soviet legislature 
many lawmakers said they were disappointment with gorbachevs 
speech 
a lot of questions remain said fyodor burlatsky the 
president explained some general ideas but we dont know the real 
functions for the new institutions burlatsky said

an excabinet minister charged nearly eight years 
ago with crimes against humanity during the nazi occupation told a 
court tuesday that his reputation had been tarnished by the 
slowmoving judicial process 
maurice papon 80 spoke at the opening of a defamation 
proceeding he initiated against a news magazine saying it was his 
only way to seek justice 
he was charged in january 1983 with crimes he allegedly 
committed between 194244 as a senior police official in the 
bordeaux region the alleged offenses include the deportation of 
1960 jews to death camps 
the 1983 charges against papon are still pending he has not 
been brought to trial in part because some potential evidence was 
thrown out on a technicality in 1987 
papon has accused the leftist le nouvel observateur and two 
reporters of defamation and improperly divulging court documents in 
an article published in june that referred to him as a french 
accomplice of genocide 
it is intolerable that a state of law lets things drag on in 
this way he said in a 25minute statement opening the trial 
enough is enough 
papon budget minister under former president valery giscard 
destaing wants 200000 in damages 
papons decision to take the legal initiative coincides with 
assertions by lawyers and human rights activists that his case and 
two others have been stalled or dragged out because of reluctance 
in the highest levels of government to expose french complicity 
in the holocaust during world war ii 
yves jouffa president of the french league of human rights 
called the three men members of an establishment that does 
not want to see its dirty laundry washed in public 
the others are rene bousquet 81 who headed the national police 
of the collaborationist vichy government and later was paris police 
chief and paul touvier 75 a militia leader who worked closely 
with gestapo chief klaus barbie in lyon he was arrested in may 
1989 at a priory in nice 
after the war papon had a successful career as a highranking 
civil servant in 1981 the satirical weekly le canard enchaine 
disclosed his wartime activities legal proceedings began and he 
left public life 
you can transplant onto me that i was the symbol of an 
administration a regime a judicial system that make all of 
france the coauthor of a genocide papon told the court saying 
he was the object of a judicial machination 
my dossier must remain open to put into the heads of all 
frenchmen that they all were collaborators all accomplices to 
genocide 
claude perdriel director of le nouvel observateur said his 
magazine was not trying to judge papon but we have a duty not to 
make a practice of forgetfulness 
journalists serge raffy and mariefrance etchegoin described 
their research as long and prudent 
the trial was to last two days

prime minister john majors vision of a society 
of opportunity faces an immediate tet from some conservative 
party members who are rebelling against a black lawyer selected as 
their candidate for parliament 
john taylor who hopes to be the first black conservative in the 
house of commons was selected last weekend by the tory 
organization in cheltenham near gloucester in western england 
some conservatives complained they were given no choice but 
taylor and one inflamed the controversy when he was quoted in a 
national newspaper as calling the candidate a bloody nigger 
william galbraith a conservative party member in cheltenham 
confirmed tuesday that he had made the remark in a private 
conversation i did not expect anything i said to friends to be 
quoted in the national press he said in an interview with bbc 
radio 
he added i did say we would not let bloody niggers into this 
town 
major who began his political climb in the racially mixed 
london district of brixton took office a week ago with a promise 
to work for a society of opportunity 
in his first major address to the conservative party 
organization on tuesday major supported taylor 
we believe that every man and woman should be able to go as 
far as their talent ambition and effort take them major said 
there should be no artificial barrier of background religion or 
race 
later answering questions in the house of commons major said 
the reported remarks by galbraith are not sentiments that have 
any place in our party 
taylor writing in tuesdays editions of the daily mail said it 
was good that the furor had erupted early in majors tenure 
it will show him precisely how big is the mountain that has to 
be climbed before the meritocracy of which he dreams becomes a 
reality taylor wrote 
taylor also won support from conservative party chairman chris 
patten appointed by major last week pattens predecessor kenneth 
baker and norman tebbit a prominent tory rightwinger who in the 
past has been an outspoken critic of immigration 
he was selected on merit patten said i do not think that 
anybody has any time at all for the rather repellent views of a 
minority in our society 
galbraith said he was unhappy that taylor was not a resident of 
the almost totally white heavily middleclass town although its 
common in british politics for candidates to be outsiders 
despite the backing of the executive committee taylor was 
selected as the local candidate in the next general election by a 
vote of 111 to 83 
this man has been bulldozed into the constituency by head 
office who are determined to have a black man in the commons 
said colin lear a real estate agent in cheltenham and a local 
party member 
there are only four blacks in the 650seat house of commons all 
members of the labor party 
about 5 percent of britains population is classified as 
nonwhite a broad label that includes west indians 
pakistanis indians chinese and persons of mixed race 
taylor 38 has previously run as a conservative candidate in 
solihull in central england typically aspiring politicians have 
to run one or more hopeless campaigns before being selected in a 
district where they have a chance of winning 
taylor the son of a west indian cricket player is a barrister 
a lawyer qualified to argue cases in court and a member of the 
local council in solihull where he was born 
monica drinkwater the conservative chairwoman in cheltenham 
said 250 people applied to be selected she said the executive 
committee of nearly 50 members whittled the group down to four by a 
secret ballot and then agreed on taylor in a second ballot 
she said tuesday that the executiv committee would meet again 
in the next 10 days when it could consider expelling galbraith 
i think we should stand back and give this issue some long 
cool and calm thought she said

prime minister john major echoing his predecessor 
margaret thatchers policies on the persian gulf on tuesday ruled 
out negotiations with iraq or any partial solutions or linkages 
to other issues 
aides said major planned to go to the gulf soon probably early 
next year to confer with leaders in the area and visit british 
troops the 30000 british troops in the region make up the 
secondbiggest western force after the us contingent 
we fully support president bush when he says that he is 
prepared to travel the extra mile to achieve such a peaceful 
solution said major referring to the planned trip to baghdad by 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
so are we but there can be no question of negotiations 
concessions partial solutions or linkage to other issues he 
told a conservative party rally the first he has addressed as 
leader 
iraqi president saddam hussein has repeatedly suggested that a 
resolution to the persian gulf crisis should be linked to an 
israeli withdrawal from occupied arab lands the united states has 
said the palestinian issue is unrelated 
britain was the prime backer of a usled initiative that 
resulted in a un security council resolution last week 
authorizing the use of force if iraq does not withdraw from kuwait 
by jan 15 
in the house of commons defense secretary tom king said britain 
had sent reinforcements to ensure that if war broke out it would be 
short and sharp and quick and that casualties on the allied side 
would be kept to a minimum 
earlier gen colin l powell chairman of the us joint chiefs 
of staff conferred with king and held his first meeting with major 
at the start of a twoday visit here 
powell was invited before the gulf crisis began in august by 
the british chief of defense staff air marshal sir david craig 
powell was to address a london research body the royal united 
services institute on wednesday 
britain decided last month to send another 14000 troops to the 
gulf bringing its troop total to 30000 public opinion polls 
continue to indicate most britons back the deployment of troops and 
generally support the governments hardline policy 
major said the terms for peace remained the same an 
unconditional iraqi withdrawal from kuwait restoration of the 
kuwaiti government and the release of all hostages

education secretary lauro cavazos on tuesday 
expanded the administrations campaign for local jurisdictions to 
give parents more freedom to decide which schools their children 
attend 
cavazos launched an education department office called the 
center for choice in education which he said will operate as 
resource for information and assistance on the issue 
president bush and i have long been vigorous supporters of 
school choice and other empowerment initiatives which allow 
families a greater voice over their future cavazos told 
reporters we believe that choice is essential for the successful 
reform of americas schools 
cavazos said the movement is gaining momentum as states explored 
a variety of ways to empower parents to select the school that best 
suits their child he noted that minnesota arkansas iowa 
nebraska and ohio were among the first to enact laws allowing 
parents to choose schools across district lines 
since last fall washington vermont utah idaho colorado and 
kentucky also have passed legislation permitting greater parental 
choice he said 
cavazos action came a day after 10 national education groups 
took a formal position against vouchers masquerading as choice 
that was an indirect criticism of a wisconsin plan which allows 
disadvantaged children to attend private nonreligious schools in 
milwaukee at public expense the funding provision of the plan has 
been unlawful for essentially technical reasons by a state 
appeals court 
singling out the wisconsin program cavazos said president 
bush supports this program and after visiting one of these schools 
i can attest personally to the hope and satisfaction such a 
program can provide particularly for lowincome and minority 
families 
on monday the forum of educational organization leaders urged 
the president and other government and community leaders at all 
levels to join in opposing private school vouchers and supporting 
the strengthening of our public schools 
cavazos said the administration takes no position on public 
support of private schools and stressed that how choice programs 
are financed really is a state or local decision 
at the present time i do not see the federal government moving 
in the direction of providing vouchers or direct support for any of 
these programs cavazos said the president has made very very 
clear that we will not move in that direction 
budget constraints are just absolutely enormous at this time 
states must make a decision whether they want to include the 
private school sector including independent and churchrelated 
schools he said 
cavazos said that in addition to the center the department will 
set up a tollfree choice hotline to respond to requests for 
reports and other information on the issue the number is 
1800442pick

federal aviation officials have imposed safety 
rules over the last six years in an effort to reduce the dangers of 
aircraft fires such as the one that swept a northwest airlines dc9 
in detroit 
but those officials acknowledge that safety cant be guaranteed 
in an aircraft propelled by highly flammable jet fuel 
mondays runway collision of the dc9 and a northwest 727 at 
detroits metropolitan airport killed eight people aboard the dc9 
the eight apparently died from inhaling noxious fumes before their 
bodies were burned beyond recognition officials said 
at least 20 other people were hospitalized with burns broken 
bones and smoke inhalation 
concern over aircraft fires was dramatized in 1977 when two 
boeing 747 jumbo jets collided on a foggy runway at tenerife in the 
canary islands killing 581 people 
in 1984 the federal aviation administration experimented with 
an antimisting fuel additive hoping it would prevent jet fuel 
vapors from igniting in a crash 
the additive worked in stationary tests however when the faa 
deliberately crashed a remotecontrolled boeing 720 in the 
california desert the jetliner was engulfed in flames 
eleven months later the faa said the concept is not practical 
for daytoday airline operation in the foreseeable future 
the experiment was not repeated 
but the faa and the department of transportation have tried to 
make aircraft cabins more flame resistant the aim the agency 
said is to prevent a fire from spreading for an additional 60 
seconds sometimes all the time needed to evacuate a burning 
aircraft 
a year after 23 people were killed in a 1983 smoky fire aboard 
an air canada jetliner the dot ordered all aircraft with 30 seats 
or more to install fire blocking material in all passenger seats 
and floorlevel lights to facilitate escape from an aircraft choked 
with smoke 
in 1988 additional safety rules were imposed after an agreement 
between the faa and the aviation industry on more stringent 
flammability standards for aircraft cabin walls ceilings and 
storage bins 
northwest said it could not immediately determine whether the 
dc9 the oldest version of the mcdonnell douglas dc9 was in full 
compliance with the faas fire safety rules

senators alan cranston and dennis deconcini 
contacted the top federal thrift regulator in support of charles h 
keating jrs efforts to sell his troubled savings and loan shortly 
before it was seized by the government the official said today 
m danny wall former chairman of the federal home loan bank 
board told the senate ethics committee that cranston dcalif 
called him several times and met with him once shortly before 
keatings lincoln savings and loan collapsed april 14 1989 they 
met on april 7 a week before the collapse 
testifying in the case of the keating five senators wall said 
both cranston and deconcini dariz urged prompt action on 
keatings application to sell the thrift and that cranston urged 
approval of the sale 
regulators rejected the sale on grounds the proposed buyers were 
actually associates of keating and that lincoln would not be made 
economically viable 
senator cranston urged that the board give prompt 
consideration to the applications and that it approve any 
legitimate proposal wall said 
senator deconcini urged that the board give prompt 
consideration to the proposals to sell lincoln but did not state 
that he wanted a particular proposal to be accepted he said 
under questioning by the committees special counsel robert s 
bennett wall said i dont recall discussing details of the 
sales with cranston 
the contacts by both senators came in 1989 nearly two years 
after regulators told the senators they were recommending criminal 
referrals about lincoln to the us justice department 
in one of his conversations wall said he told deconcini of 
objections the top california state regulator was raising about the 
sale of lincoln they also may have discussed how lincoln could 
switch from a california charter to a federal charter thus 
avoiding the requirement that the california regulator william j 
crawford approve any sale 
that conversation was two weeks after crawford had written wall 
expressing grave concerns about the transaction and warning 
do not be misled into believing that california officials would 
approve the sale 
he recalled calling cranston the day the government seized 
lincoln to inform him he said cranston said something to the 
effect i think the board has made a mistake i hope you are 
right 
in his testimony wall described keating as a master at 
delay who kept regulators at bay while draining lincoln of money 
the ethics committee is investigating allegations the five 
senators improperly intervened with regulators on keatings behalf 
the financier and his associates gave 13 million to the senators 
campaigns and favored causes 
besides cranston and deconcini senators under scrutiny are john 
mccain of arizona the only republican and democrats john glenn of 
ohio and donald riegle of michigan 
wall also testified that he didnt learn of his staffs 
recommendation of a criminal investigation of lincoln for more than 
a year after five senators were informed by regulators on april 9 
1987 
wall said he met with keating in september 1987 to discuss 
keatings concerns about regulators examination of thrift wall 
acknowledged telling keating his staff would take a fresh look 
at the examination 
though the senators had been informed that april wall said he 
was not told by his own staff of the criminal referral until may 
1988 
wall a former republican senate banking committee staffer 
became chairman of the federal home loan bank board in 1987 
following edwin j gray who is now the chief witness against the 
senators 
wall told the panel he received a telephone call from cranston 
in july or august 1987 expressing concern about the length of the 
examination he said cranston told him we ought to make a 
decision and get on with it 
wall said he told keating he would take a new look at the 
lincoln examination because he was setting up a new management 
structure 
i felt it was appropriate and desirable for us to determine 
for ourselves what the result of the examination was and to try 
to reconcile the differences between field examiners who 
recommended the criminal referral and washington regulators who had 
not acted on the recommendation he said 
meanwhile law enforcement sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said monday that the fbi is looking into the senators 
conduct as part of a wideranging investigation being coordinated 
with federal prosecutors in los angeles and phoenix 
examination of the senators dealings with keating is one aspect 
of the broad federal criminal inquiry into allegations of financial 
wrongdoing at lincoln savings and its parent american continental

the justice department said tuesday that a 
monthlong inquiry had produced no evidence that terrorists who 
blew up pan am flight 103 two years ago were unwittingly aided by 
an undercover us drug investigation 
neither the fbi which is investigating the dec 21 1988 
bombing nor the drug enforcement administration found evidence to 
substantiate broadcast reports that terrorists took advantage of an 
undercover dea operation to smuggle explosives aboard the plane 
nbc and abc both reported in late october that security at the 
frankfurt airport where the new yorkbound flight originated had 
been relaxed to accommodate dea investigators who were tracking 
usbound drug shipments 
but deputy attorney general william p barr said in a statement 
tuesday that no evidence has been revealed to support any of the 
allegations that a dea operation was in any way involved in the pan 
am tragedy 
dea had no investigative or operational activity in effect on 
dec 21 1988 that involved the use of pan am flight 103 or 
frankfurt international airport barr said 
a bomb destroyed the plane as it flew over lockerbie scotland 
killing 259 people on board and 11 on the ground the flight 
originated in frankfurt with a stop in london where passengers and 
luggage were transferred to another aircraft 
law enforcement officials in britain and germany continue to 
investigate the bombing along with the fbi 
investigators believe the bombing was carried out by members of 
the popular front for the liberation of palestine but the fbi has 
not yet produced enough evidence to bring criminal charges against 
specific individuals according to law enforcement sources 
barr also said the dea inquiry found that its agents did not 
circumvent security measures at the frankfurt airport at any 
time 
barrs statement also discounted reports that one of the 
passengers killed in the bombing khalid nazir jaafar had been a 
dea informant and was cooperating in an undercover operation to 
trace drug shipments from the middle east to detroit 
jaafar was not an informant nor was he working for the dea in 
any other capacity on dec 21 1988 or at any other time barr 
said the dea had found allegations that khalid jaafar visited a 
dea office are incorrect 
the statement was issued as attorney general dick thornburgh was 
in the midst of a weeklong european trip on wednesday thornburgh 
is scheduled to attend the rome conference of trevi an 
organization of european law enforcement officials 
dea quickly denied the network reports after they were 
broadcast and the justice department said there was no evidence 
at that point to substantiate them but the justice department 
ordered a further inquiry into the matter

investigators working in a light snow on a 
windy runway today surveyed the burnedout shell of a jetliner that 
turned into the path of another causing a collision that killed 
eight people 
the investigators spokesman refused to respond to speculation 
that fog disoriented the pilot of the dc9 which collided monday 
with a boeing 727 racing down a runway toward takeoff at detroit 
metropolitan airport 
at least 20 people were treated for burns broken bones smoke 
inhalation and other injuries and seven remained in hospitals 
today some had leapt to the slushy runway as an explosion of 
flames burned the roof off their plane 
the national transportation safety board set up teams to look 
into such factors as human performance engines and survivors 
recollections before daybreak investigators used stadiumstyle 
lights to inspect the wreckage in 32degree cold with a wind chill 
of 4 degrees 
its not particularly a benign environment out there right 
now john lauber a ntsb member said at a morning briefing 
lauber said investigators were warned to be cautious in picking 
through the unstable wreckage under time pressure caused by the 
weather airport officials wanted the two planes both operated by 
northwest airlines moved to reopen the only runway not affected by 
crosswinds lauber said 
officials said the jets both left their gates at 131 pm and 
ended up 2500 feet apart on the same runway after the collision 
the 727 was racing down a runway toward takeoff when its wing 
was sheared off by the dc9 which had turned in front of it fuel 
poured from the planes and the dc9 burst into flames killing 
seven men and one woman a flight attendant among the 43 people 
aboard 
the victims apparently died from noxious fumes before their 
bodies were burned beyond recognition dr bader cassin chief 
medical examiner for wayne county said today 
it was like a big kerosene torch said passenger john izzo 
41 of pittsburgh who escaped uninjured by jumping off a wing 
the only thing going through my mind was im going to die in 
this damn plane and im only 26 years old said another 
passenger medical student mike marrone of saddle river nj 
the pilots survived the collision authorities said one was 
treated at a hospital and released and there was no word the 
others were injured 
northwest spokesman bob gibbons said it was unclear who was at 
the controls of the dc9 pilot william lovelace or first officer 
james s chifferns 
lovelace is a 24year veteran of the airline who had been on a 
medical leave for kidney stones for the past five years chifferns 
joined northwest seven months ago after 20 years in the air force 
flight 1482 was lovelaces 13th since returning to work his 
previous flights had been observed by another northwest pilot and 
five were from detroit 
gibbons identified the dead flight attendant as 43yearold 
heidi joost of the detroit suburb of dearborn 
crew members on both planes and air traffic controllers were 
ordered to undergo drug tests which are routine after such an 
accident 
it was not immediately known what instructions the dc9 received 
before straying into the path of the 727 
gibbons said we dont know if the pilot got lost in the fog 
or what but that is a topic in the investigation 
at the time of the crash visibility was estimated by the 
controllers union at a quartermile the ground was wet from a 
snow and sleet storm that delayed flights at the airport which was 
closed at the time to inbound flights 
lauber said the dc9s black box recorders were sent to 
washington for analysis he declined to speculate on the cause of 
the crash 
however tony dresden a spokesman for the national air traffic 
controllers said the dc9 pilot apparently got lost in the fog 
the dc9 pilot discovered at the very last moment where he was 
and so the ground controller told him to immediately get off that 
runway but it was too late dresden said 
the federal aviation administration had no immediate comment on 
dresdens statement 
air line pilots association spokesman al pregler blasted the faa 
for not having installed a groundlevel radar system at the airport 
for avoiding collisions 
we have been pushing them to do this for a long time but they 
havent pregler said its expensive and they dont want to 
spend the money 
faa spokeswoman barb dettmer said a system is scheduled for 
installation next year 
airport officials said both planes left their gates at 131 pm 
and headed onto fogshrouded runways for takeoff 
the dc9 bound for pittsburgh carried 39 passengers and four 
crew members the 727 was headed for memphis tenn with 145 
passengers and eight crew members 
the 727 was about to go airborne when its right wing clipped the 
dc9 behind the copilots seat knocking off a rearmounted 
engine smoke billowed from the dc9 fuselage where passengers 
apparently became trapped by the fastmoving fire 
one of the injured was reported in critical condition 
the only injuries suffered on the 727 were to people hurt 
evacuating the plane 
robert karp 60 of jackson miss said he thought at first 
that the 727 had simply blown a tire 
the front end of the plane had begun to lift off karp said 
i dont think the back wheels were off the ground yet as soon as 
i heard the thump we came to an abrupt stop i remember looking at 
the other plane and seeing smoke rolling out 
romulus 10 miles from detroit was the site of the second worst 
air crash in us history the aug 16 1987 crash of a northwest 
md80 on takeoff that one killed 156

israeli troops on tuesday killed an armed 
guerrilla in a firefight in israels selfproclaimed security zone 
in southern lebanon the israeli military command and lebanese 
security sources said 
two israeli soldiers were slightly wounded in the clash which 
occurred in the western sector near the village of ramayah 13 
miles southeast of the southern port city of tyre the israeli army 
said 
israeli forces from the givati infantry brigade were on an 
initiated action when they spotted a squad of guerrillas heading 
toward the israeli border and they opened fire from a short 
distance said the army statement issued in jerusalem 
lebanese security sources said the slain guerrilla was a 
palestinian 
troops found an antitank bazooka grenade launchers and 
magazines from a sovietdesigned kalashnikov rifle near the body of 
the slain guerrilla the army said 
the moslemrun voice of the nation said the israelis brought in 
tanks to reinforce their troops and helicopter gunships strafed 
suspected guerrilla positions in the region after daybreak 
tuesdays clash followed a spate of incidents involving israeli 
soldiers or their militia allies in or around the 
israelicontrolled zone in southern lebanon 
on monday israelibacked lebanese militiamen killed five 
guerrillas who according to an army statement belonged to a 
lebanese branch of the baath party and the lebanese resistance

palestinian guerrillas were killed in a clash in the eastern sector 
of the buffer zone the army said those guerrillas belonged to the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine a plo faction led by 
george habash 
israel carved out the 440squaremile buffer zone to protect its 
northern border against guerrilla raids in 1985 when it withdrew 
the bulk of its forces from lebanon after a threeyear occupation 
the zone is jointly patrolled by israeli soldiers and about 
2700 members of the mostly christian south lebanon army militia

a kremlin official said tuesday that a new job 
apparently is in the works for vadim bakatin the interior minister 
dismissed by president mikhail gorbachev two days earlier 
a soviet newspaper said gorbachev might name bakatin to the new 
post of vice president bakatin also was being considered to head 
the new national security council the german newspaper bild 
reported 
neither gorbachev nor bakatin commented on the unconfirmed 
reports in komsomolskaya pravda and bild the newspapers did not 
give sources for their reports 
bild also reported that gorbachev is likely to step down as 
communist party chief by the end of the year while remaining 
president a once purely ceremonial post that he has built into a 
powerful office 
last week gorbachev again denied that he plans to quit as the 
partys general secretary 
dozens of ministers are expected to lose their positions as 
gorbachev trims the cabinet from 56 to about 15 officials 
at the supreme soviet legislature some lawmakers hotly debated 
the motives for the cabinet shakeup hardline legislators praised 
gorbachevs decision to dismiss bakatin and replace him with a kgb 
general who is expected to crack down on independence movements in 
the republics 
but the newspaper reports raisedthe possibility that gorbachev 
could be feinting left and striking right removing a favorite of 
reformists only to place him in a more important post 
bakatin is popular with reformers who support the independence 
movements in the baltics and other republics because he put a 
tighter rein on riot police after 19 peaceful demonstrators were 
killed by troops last year 
presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko told reporters bakatin 
was not removed from the interior ministers job because of any 
dissatisfaction with his performance 
i believe that a new post is in line for him but we have to 
patient to see what that post will be and only after that will we 
be able to make conclusions ignatenko said 
the interior ministry meanwhile released figures showing 
violent crime has jumped 12 percent this year to the highest level 
in a decade but ministry officials defended bakatin as a 
hardworking and intelligent boss and attributed the increased 
crime to the sagging economy and shortages of consumer goods 
problems beyond his control 
bakatins removal was as unexpected for us as it was for 
you interior ministry gen boris b dziov told reporters but 
obviously the political leadership knows what its doing and its 
difficult for us to judge 
bakatin was replaced by boris pugo 53 a communist party 
official who became a kgb major general while running the secret 
police in latvia in the early 1980s his new deputy is army gen 
boris gromov a 47yearold hardliner who commanded soviet troops 
in afghanistan and criticized gorbachevs cuts in defense spending 
pugo said in an interview published in the government newspaper 
izvestia on tuesday that the increase in crime cannot be 
tolerated he said gorbachev was particularly concerned about 
organized crime corruption and the creation of independent 
militias in republics such as moldavia and georgia 
i regard the republics sovereignty with understanding but 
without infringing on the right of republics efforts should be 
pooled in order to struggle against grave crimes and prevent 
outbursts of violence on ethnic grounds pugo said

the navy said tuesday it is forcing out the 
three top overseers of its classified a12 stealth bomber program 
including two admirals for their failure to disclose serious flaws 
in the aircrafts development 
the extraordinary action by navy secretary h lawrence garrett 
iii was announced by the service as the pentagon released an 
internal navy report that outlined a startling breakdown in 
government and navy supervision of the sixyearold bomber program 
the a12 avenger is the navys top aircraft priority the 
carrierbased aircraft is scheduled to begin replacing the navys 
aging fleet of a6 intruder attack planes in 1995 and to serve as a 
mainstay well into the 21st century 
controversy over the planes development now more than a year 
behind schedule and at least 20 percent over the planned 47 
billion cost heated up in june when the contractors general 
dynamics and mcdonnell douglas told the navy they could not 
produce the first plane on time that costs were escalating and 
that it could not meet certain performance standards for the 
aircraft 
just a few weeks earlier defense secretary dick cheney had 
announced after a highlevel review of the a12 program that the 
project was fully on track 
garrett wrote in a memo to cheney dated nov 29 that the navys 
a12 program supervisors failed to make clear to top navy and 
pentagon leadership that the aircrafts development was faring much 
worse than the contractor claimed 
garrett told cheney he was forcing vice adm richard c gentz 
commander of naval air systems command to retire by feb 1 he 
also said he was reassigning the program executive officer for 
tactical aircraft programs rear adm john f calvert and the a12 
program manager capt lawrence g elberfeld 
calvert and elberfeld also received letters of censure from the 
navy secretary although garrett said he would not stop elberfelds 
scheduled promotion to rear admiral 
attempts to reach the three officers were unsuccessful calls to 
gentz office were not answered an aide in elberfelds office said 
he was out of town and could not be reached and an aide to calvert 
said his boss would not comment 
a statement issued in cheneys name tuesday said he was troubled 
by the conclusions of a separate a12 investigation by the 
pentagons inspector general cheney ordered deputy defense 
secretary donald atwood to make recommendations for corrective 
action when cheney returns from europe next week 
a central theme of both the internal navy report and the 
pentagon inspector generals investigation is that overly 
optimistic cost and schedule estimates of the contractors were not 
sufficiently challenged by the government the investigations also 
said official secrecy helped mask the projects problems 
the navy report said mcdonnell douglas and general dynamics 
contract officials failed to tell the navy of cost and schedule 
problems they knew existed it said the contract officials felt 
pressured by upper management at mcdonnell douglas and general 
dynamics to avoid making forcasts of cost or schedule overruns 
because such problems would reduce contract payments to the 
companies 
in its report the inspector generals office cited an instance 
in which general dynamics required government inspectors at the 
companys a12 plant in fort worth texas to turn over their notes 
to review them for security classification one set of notes was 
lost and it later was determined that they had contained no secret 
information anyway 
we question any procedure by which a contractor obtains access 
to and control over the work product of government personnel 
engaged in oversight duties the report said 
the inspector general was highly critical of the role of john a 
betti the under secretary of defense for acquisition it said he 
put too much credence in assurances by the contractors that the 
project could be completed on time and within the cost ceiling and 
that he dismissed warnings by lowerlevel pentagon officials that 
the project was encountering serious problems 
we find mr bettis failure especially troublesome in view of 
a prior warning within the office of the secretary of defense of 
cost growth on the a12 program susan j crawford the inspector 
general wrote in a letter to rep andy ireland rfla 
ireland a member of the house armed services committee said in 
a statement released tuesday that the inspector generals report 
illustrated a fundamental flaw in the pentagons system of 
assigning responsibility for weapons development 
program managers are giving assurances about contractors 
adherence to budgets based largely on the word of the contractors 
themselves he wrote it is a process ripe for abuse

most us hospitals surveyed have admitted at 
least one aids patient but their policies on testing for aids vary 
widely often pitting the interests of patients against those of 
doctors and nurses researchers say 
to a certain extent hospitals are in a nowin situation 
since policy provisions protecting patients may be incompatible 
with provisions protecting healthcare personnel said the 
researchers who surveyed 561 hospitals 
not only do hospitals face potential risk of litigation from 
patients for violation of their rights but hospitals also may be 
held responsible for placing healt care personnel at increased 
risk by withholding relevant information about infected patients 
the researchers said 
they drew their sample randomly from a list of all nonfederal 
general acutecare hospitals with more than 25 beds and reported 
their findings in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association 
about twothirds of the hospitals had at least one aids patient 
including 40 percent of rural hospitals indicating aids is no 
longer a disease of big cities said dr charles e lewis 
professor of medicine at the university of california los angeles 
he and kathleen montgomery of the university of california 
riverside found that 83 percent of hospitals have formal written 
policies about testing patients for infection with hiv the aids 
virus 
most policies have provisions protecting patients rights the 
researchers found for example 78 percent required the patients 
informed consent before the test whether written or verbal 66 
percent required a written consent and 75 percent required that 
patients who tested positive be told the results 
many policies also had provisions protecting healthcare 
workers the researchers said for example 56 percent required 
that test results appear in patients records 38 percent required 
a review of treatment plans when a patient tests positive and 3 
percent required that hivpositive patients be discharged or 
transferred 
carisa cunningham a new york spokeswoman for an aids activist 
group said patient care should be first priority in any hospitals 
policy 
the question we always ask is what is the information needed 
for who needs it and why said cunningham of the gay mens 
health crisis 
if health care providers want the information so they can 
transfer a patient to another hospital and not have to deal with 
them thats not acceptable 
dr frank rhame director of the hiv clinic at the university of 
minnesota hospital in minneapolis said the study is the largest to 
explore policies about hiv testing at us hospitals 
but he cautioned that policies and actual practices often 
differ 
what most people have recommended and whats actually being 
done and what the policy may be are at considerable variance he 
said in a telephone interview 
i think that its important to evaluate the actual practice 
he said its harder youve actually got to go in the hospital 
and get a record of every hiv test thats been performed and verify 
that the patient was notified

the department of housing and urban 
development has tightened its housing eligibility rules after 
learning that texas businessmen and church leaders were living in 
units designated for homeless 
james forsberg director of huds program of homeless housing 
confirmed the situation uncovered by the fort worth startelegram 
but said regional administrators in other parts of the country told 
him they knew of no similar problems 
it would appear right now that the issue has been limited to 
texas and probably the northern part of texas forsberg said 
tuesday 
the startelegram in a story in sundays editions reported 
that 
businessman and parttime street minister roy gray of keller 
rents a 92500 home in the upscale dallas suburb of rowlett for 1 
a year 
baptist minister bill robinson has moved into a twostory home 
in arlington texas appraised at 92000 under the program 
although the net worth of his nonprofit company will soon exceed 
1 million 
those people were there forsberg said they shouldnt 
have been but nobody can dispute the fact they were we will move 
to get them out 
forsberg said rules were changed monday during a series of 
meetings with hud officials including secretary jack kemp 
we tightened up to say the purpose of the program is to help 
people who are homeless and had no other resources that they could 
use to find housing elsewhere forsberg said looking at some 
of the people they have identified it is clear they had resources 
they could have used to find housing on the market 
gray and robinson defended their placement in hud homes saying 
that they their relatives and associates qualified as homeless 
the earlier regulations had defined a homeless person as 
virtually anyone without a permanent home regardless of income 
kemp launched the program after he took office in february 1989 
it makes available up to 10 percent of 50000 foreclosed homes that 
the federal government owns 
forsberg said field offices had been given additional guidance 
on screening the nonprofit organizations applying to administer 
housing under the program 
he said the objective was to see that they had experience in 
helping the homeless and had the financial resources to manage the 
units without relying on rent from highincome people he said a 
new effort would also be made to make sure the nonprofits can 
bring appropriate social services to bear 
under the program churches and nonprofit groups lease 
foreclosed hud homes for 1 a year and then rent them to the 
homeless for modest fees usually about 250 a month they also can 
buy the properties at a 10 percent discount 
hud spokesman jack flynn said the new rules would include a 
requirement that the property be dedicated to use for the homeless 
for 10 years after being purchased 
the regulations will be subject to a period of public comment 
after being published in the federal register

happiness was tempered with concern for those left behind 
i just wanted to make sure that everybody here realizes that 
there are hundreds of more americans and thousands in total of 
foreigners still there harry brilledwards 49 of fort lee 
nj told reporters after arriving at kennedy airport 
every one of us who is on this plane tonight is only happy to 
a certain degree the rest of his heart is sad for the guys who are 
still there

iraq and kuwait and it believes 88 are being used as human 
shields at strategic sites iraq released 15 americans to ali 
including 10 with medical conditions 
a few hours after the hostages arrival a group of americans 
boarded the same plane back to amman jordan in hopes of reunions 
wednesday in baghdad with relatives they are trying to bring home

his shelter during captivity ranged from a trailer to a 
threebedroom house they fought off boredom by playing cars 
exercising taking walks and swapping novels 
as time passed and captors became familiar with the prisoners 
conditions improved but a lot depended on the political hassle 
that went on in the press brilledwards said as things got 
tough politically things got tougher in the camps 
none of the captives knew how they were chosen for freedom 
smart theorized he had been picked out of a hat they were 
given as little as 15 minutes notice that they were being freed 
ali did not speak during the brief session with reporters but 
an attorney paul sanchi read a statement from ali that said 
im on the side of al islam which means peace 
the hostages praised him as a gentleman and a super human 
being

president bush called for a 
permanent partnership among all nations of the americas as he 
arrived today in one of south americas smallest countries he 
played down the importance of the military uprising in neighboring 
argentina his next stop 
at a news conference after talks with president luis alberto 
lacalle bush pronounced argentina democratically stable and 
said the turmoil that erupted tuesday was not aimed at the elected 
government but was a military vs military issue 
several hundred leftist demonstrators assembled 150 yards from 
the legislative assembly where bush addressed a joint session of 
congress 
at an airport welcoming ceremony bush said we in the 
americas are on the brink of something unprecedented in world 
history the first wholly democratic hemisphere 
in anticipation of that we need to create together a 
permanent partnership among all the nations of the americas said 
bush the first american president to visit uruguay since lyndon 
johnson in 1967 bush was underscoring the primary focus of his 
trip a salute to democracy and his proposal for free trade 
throughout the hemisphere 
thousands of people lined bushs motorcade route through the 
streets of montevideo the crowds were overwhelmingly friendly 
although there were clusters of demonstrators making rude hand 
gestures and waving signs 
after their talks at the edificio libertad the presidents 
headquarters bush and lacalle both spoke of the importance of 
lifting barriers to international trade including farm subsidies 
trade talks are now in their final days in brussels in the effort 
to rewrite the global trading rules last forged in uruguay five 
years ago 
we are in the same boat with the gatt negotiations said 
lacalle who said cutthroat tariffs have hurt millions of 
people 
we foresee a whole hemisphere of much more open trade said 
bush who exhorted developing countries to move briskly to 
privatization to free markets in order to attract investments 
and new technology 
bush said he was very pleased to be going to buenos aires on 
wednesday and said he did not view mondays brief military 
rebellion as a sign of instability in argentina four of the five 
countries that bush is visiting this week emerged from military 
rule in the 1980s 
bush also said he would have no trouble working with socialists 
but the whole world is moving in the opposite direction from 
that failed formula 
leftist demonstrators were scheduled to stage a protest to 
coincide with an afternoon speech bush planned to the national 
legislature there also were calls for a mass protest tonight after 
bushs departure from montevideo for the resort city of punta del 
este 
uruguay is one of the few countries left with a strong leftwing 
movement uruguayan radicals oppose bushs call for marketoriented 
economies in latin america 
the president did not mention the troubles in neighboring 
argentina where the government put down a military coup attempt a 
day earlier 
us officials were not surprised that a military rebellion in 
argentina fizzled but there were lingering concerns over bushs 
safety 
as the president made the rounds of brasilia on monday the 
initial assessments of the situation in argentina were uniformly 
upbeat i have great confidence in the security there bush 
said vowing to go ahead with the trip wednesday 
by evening deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger 
betrayed some doubt saying if the situation became such that 
there was a real danger to his bushs security im sure wed 
take another look at it hours later the last of the rebels had 
surrendered thirteen people were reported killed 
for the administration the most reassuring aspect about the 
argentine upheaval was that the rebels said they had no intention 
of ousting the 17monthold elected government of president carlos 
s menem they said they merely wanted to call attention to their 
grievances officials were confident menem was in no danger of 
being overthrown 
still the timing for bush could hardly have been worse he 
wanted to use this trip partly to call attention to the 
hemispheres democratic development over the past decade 
bush said in a speech to the brazilian legislature on monday 
that the hemisphere had embarked on a new era of hope a 
statement that did not blend well with the scenes of violence 
occurring next door in argentina including some near menems 
office in buenos aires 
francisco rezek brazils foreign minister called the revolt in 
argentina a step backward for democracy in latin america 
a highlight of the presidents visit to brazil was the 
announcement of approval by bush to license the sale of a 
highperformance computer with potential military uses that 
brazil had sought for two years the us move was prompted by 
brazils having joined with argentina last week in renouncing the 
manufacture of nuclear weapons 
the president also praised brazil for being among the first 
countries to impose economic sanctions against iraq last august 
aside from celebrating democracy a main purpose of bushs tour 
is to promote his vision of a hemispherewide free trade area and 
to encourage the trend toward growthoriented economic policies 
after his visit wednesday to argentina bush flies to chile on 
thursday and heads home saturday after a visit to venezuela

president mikhail s gorbachev said tuesday he 
will crack down on black marketeering and boost food imports to 
feed the nation this winter and he wants people to plant their own 
gardens to raise food next year 
rural and urban residents should be free to pursue 
agriculture gorbachev told the supreme soviet legislature which 
has demanded urgent steps to ease the food crisis 
gorbachev also outlined proposed changes in the governmen 
including the creation of a vice presidency and a security council 
they also would streamline the cabinet and strengthen the 
federation council which includes representatives of the 
republics 
those changes require constitutional amendments and the supreme 
soviet legislature voted 28117 to recommend that the larger 
congress of peoples deputies amend the charter when it convenes on 
dec 17 
despite the lopsided vote many legislators said they were 
disappointed gorbachev did not give more details on either the food 
program or government restructuring which he first outlined on 
nov 17 
a lot of questions remain said fyodor burlatsky a 
reformer the president explained some general ideas but we 
dont know the real functions for the new institutions 
gorbachev after fielding questions from legislators said he 
rejected accusations that the proposed changes reflected imperial 
ambitions for the strengthened office of president the official 
news agency tass reported 
the president provided the most detailed statistics yet on the 
food the soviet union plans to import with foreign aid he has 
secured over the past two months 
during the first three months of 1991 he said the government 
would spend about 12 billion on food that included 10 million 
tons of grain 19 million tons of sugar 156000 tons of flour 
277000 tons of sunflower oil 357000 tons of meat and meat 
products 45 million tons of milk products and 110000 tons of 
groats 
the united states germany and italy have begun sending food aid 
to the soviet union and other nations have pledged support soviet 
officials blame food problems on the collapse of the central 
distribution system 
gorbachev said workers control committees would be formed over 
the next two or three weeks to make sure food is not diverted to 
the black market from the state distribution system the kgb 
security police and state prosecutors have also been assigned to 
this task soviet officials have said 
a survey by security bodies of 50 stores in moscow has shown 
that when the stores close a third shift starts working the 
same thing happens at warehouses gorbachev said workers often 
set aside scarce food for sale to acquaintances at inflated prices 
a new system is being created that will put the situation 
under strict control he said we will take resolute actions 
while tight controls and imports might ease the food crisis for 
the next three or four months gorbachev said food supplies could 
be increased if people were allowed to work their own gardens he 
said he would seek up to 12 million acres for private plot 
farming 
the parliament of the russian federation the largest of the 15 
soviet republics on monday authorized private ownership of 
farmland but gorbachev balked at that step and the garden plots 
will remain under state and collective ownership 
gorbachev also repeated plans to rename the council of ministers 
the cabinet of ministers under the direction of a prime minister 
to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the legislature 
aides said cabinet membership would drop from 56 ministers to about 
15 
the cabinet of ministers would be responsible to the president 
and control the national budget energy industries transportation 
environmental protection and credit and foreign currency 
the cabinet also would work with the republics on a national 
program for health insurance maternity and child care issues 
culture and education and basic scientific research 
gorbachev said he would create a vice presidency to be the 
presidents righthand man 
he also would abolish the presidential council created earlier 
this year some of its members probably the defense and interior 
ministers and head of the kgb would be transferred to the new 
security council 
gorbachev also would expand the powers of the federation 
council which includes leaders of the 15 republics it will be 
responsible for ethnic issues and relations among the national and 
republican governments

germanys social democrats facing their 
worst crisis in years are reeling from an election debacle and 
desperately seeking a youthful leader with the talents of senior 
party member willy brandt 
chancellor helmut kohls coalition defeated the social 
democrats led by challenger oskar lafontaine in sundays 
election the first allgerman balloting in 58 years 
the social democrats are a party without a platform crippled by 
internal divisions and in need of fresh leadership 
the social democrats biggest problem is their dearth of 
solidarity said renate koecher a researcher at the allensbach 
polling institute 
they lost a halfmillion votes to kohls christian democrats in 
the opposition partys worst electoral showing since 1957 it was 
the social democrats third defeat by kohl since he came to power 
eight years ago 
kohls grasp on germanys leadership is already being compared 
to that of konrad adenauer west germanys first chancellor who 
held office for 14 years 
it really is now a fairly unbalanced political system with a 
very strong predominance of the government parties said peter 
pulzer an oxford university germany specialist who observed the 
elections 
it took brandt finally to dislodge adenauers christian 
democrats in 1969 the social democrats are now hunting for a 
leader who can do the same to kohl 
brandt 76 is the social democrats most popular member and is 
respected throughout the party 
the social democrats national image has been badly tarnished as 
a result of sundays election and their campaign tactics 
lafontaine refused to embrace fully german unity during the 
campaign the resulting damage was especially severe in former east 
germany where the party captured only 25 percent of the vote 
social democrats are now viewed by many there as political pariahs 
the party leadership needs rejuvenation said national 
chairman hansjochen vogel who on tuesday announced plans to step 
down 
the party offered the leadership to 47yearold lafontaine but 
he turned it down saying he is too busy as governor of saarland 
state he also complained about the halfhearted support his 
campaign received among some social democrats 
it is impossible to conduct an election campaign without 
solidarity lafontaine said tuesday 
other possible candidates for the top party job include johannes 
rau walter momper and bjoern engholm 
rau 59 is the popular governor of north rhinewestphalia but 
he lost heavily to kohl in the 1987 chancellor race 
momper the 45yearold former mayor of berlin had been seen as 
a rising star within the social democrats ranks but he lost in 
berlin city elections on sunday 
engholm the 51yearold governor of schleswigholstein state 
is a dapper pipesmoking intellectual popular in his home state 
one of the social democrats best orators 47yearold herta 
daeublergmelin has also been mentioned for the job 
regardless of who becomes the new party leader observers say 
the social democrats also need new ideas 
lafontaine spent most of his campaign warning against the 
pitfalls of unification rather than proposing how unitys problems 
like high unemployment in former east germany can be solved 
the spd should wholeheartedly say that unification is a 
positive development said ms koecher of the allensbach 
institute 
secondly they should see the new german states east germany 
as new turf where they have to be intensively engaged 
if the social democrats can succeed in making friends out of 
enemies in eastern germany they certainly have a chance to 
become far stronger ms koecher said

rebel commander idriss deby on tuesday 
was named interim leader of chad and immediately called for unity 
he also said he would implement multiparty democracy in this nation 
of 54 million residents 
deby who ousted president hissene habre after three weeks of 
fighting promised democratic reforms in a nationwide radio 
address 
i stress that there cannot be democracy without political 
pluralism and secularity he said he called on chadian 
oppositionists in exile to return saying he was inviting all the 
sons of chad to a sincere pardon to solve our problems 
democratically 
he also expressed his determination to keep the mineralrich 
aouzou strip in northern chad which is claimed by libya 
we will defend our national unity the territorial integrity 
of chad within its borders inherited from colonization deby said 
in a nationwide radio address 
chad will pursue a policy of good neighborliness and 
noninterference with its neighbors deby said 
deby 38 was named interim head of state by the executive 
committee of his patriotic salvation movement the duration of his 
term was not announced 
the executive committee created a state council under debys 
control and replaced the nations constitution which had been 
suspended monday when deby dissolved the national assembly 
deby had said earlier that he wanted to establish a democratic 
government as quickly as possible french ambassador to chad 
francois gendreau said 
gendreau also indicated that france which beefed up its 
military forces in chad by 500 troops to 1800 last week would not 
attempt to intervene chad is a former french protectorate and was 
incorporated into french equatorial africa before gaining 
independence in 1960 
french defense minister jeanpierre chevenement said france 
which withdrew 150 soldiers tuesday decided to remain neutral 
during the war in its former colony 
we did not let hissene habre fall he said we simply gave 
the order for our jaguars warplanes to not bomb or strafe idriss 
debys columns 
habre fled the country reportedly to neighboring cameroon on 
saturday after a threeweek war in which government troops were 
routed by rebel soldiers loyal to deby 
a day later deby made a triumphant entry into ndjamena 
the rebels received 40 percent of their weapons from libya 
according to french officials deby distanced himself from libya by 
ruling out negotiations on the aouzou strip but allowed libyan 
prisoners of war to return home monday 
on monday deby began a series of consultations meeting with 
us ambassador richard bogosian and senior libyan officials 
including the army chief of staff there were no immediate details 
of their talks 
habre took his family and eight cabinet ministers to maroua in 
cameroon according to the state newspaper the cameroon tribune 
it quoted one of the exiled chadians as saying habre was the 
victim of a foreign conspiracy and fled to avoid a 
humiliation like that of samuel doe doe the former president of 
liberia was captured and killed by liberian rebels in august 
deby was habres chief aide in a 1982 coup but broke away last 
year and formed a rebel movement habre and us officials claim 
libya actively backed debys rebellion but the libyans and deby 
deny it 
a dusktodawn curfew remained in effect following widespread 
looting saturday but residents said ndjamena had been calm since 
then 
libyas army occupied northern chad in 1983 and 1986 prompting 
france to send troops to back habre libya was driven out in a 
series of battles masterminded by deby in 1987

the district of columbia council moved to 
sharply restrict cigarette sales in the nations capital tuesday by 
passing a bill banning cigarette vending machines from most 
restaurants 
the legislation also prohibits the sale of cigarettesoor other 
tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 and forbids the 
distribution of free cigarette samples on city streets 
were not trying to stop people from buying cigarettes said 
council member nadine winter the bills sponsor were trying to 
limit access to youths to keep them from dying 
under the old city law anyone 16 or older could buy cigarettes 
an amendment to the bill allows vending machines in restaurants 
where they can be monitored by employees 
the bill passed by voice vote despite the protests of council 
members who complained that the rights of smokers were being 
violated 
i believe this does not do enough to protect the rights of 
smokers said council member harry thomas im a smoker but i 
just think that this is too conservative 
supporters of the legislation described it as an attempt to 
lower the cancer rate in the nations capital city records show 
that in the district and across the nation cancer is the 
secondleading cause of death trailing only heart disease 
by passing the bill the nations capital becomes the fourth 
major city to curtail cigarette sales salt lake city and 
minneapolis already have prohibitions on some forms of cigarette 
sales and the new york city council voted earlier this month to 
ban cigarette vending machines except in taverns

the schools chancellor wants to make condoms 
available to public high school students to help lower the rate of 
teenage aids cases in the city which he said is the highest in 
the country 
the issue requires that we acknowledge that young people are 
sexually active and engaging in highrisk behaviors said schools 
chancellor joseph fernandez 
new york city is leading the nation in adolescent aids 
cases he said with courage and conviction we can provide our 
youth with the facts the skills and the confidence to protect 
themselves 
fernandezs plan would make condoms available on request to any 
of the citys 260000 high school students at each of the more than 
100 schools a requesting child would remain anonymous and would 
not need approval of a parent 
the condoms would be dispensed from a site in each high school 
staffed by two adult volunteers from the school one man and one 
woman the staffers would be able but not required to offer 
counseling 
sex and aids education are already part of the regular 
curriculum in elementary and secondary grades each high school 
would be responsible for setting up its own program under whatever 
guidelines the board adopts 
a majority of the sevenmember school board which sets general 
policy for the citys millionchild public school system has 
supported the idea of condom availability accompanied by sex and 
aids counseling at the 17 high schools that have their own health 
clinics 
but board member westina l matthews called fernandezs proposal 
much broader than i originally understood and she said tuesday 
she was not sure how she would vote 
michael j petrides a board member who favors more sex and aids 
education but opposes condom distribution maintained that handing

merchants criticized police response as they 
angrily cleaned up tuesday from a night of looting and fires 
triggered by the acquittal of six police officers in the fatal 
beating of a puerto rican drug dealer 
fire officials estimated the fire damage alone at 29 million 
police chief perry anderson said police could have moved in 
earlier but he defended his department saying there were no 
deaths or violent clashes with police 
mayor xavier suarez met with leaders in the largely puerto rican 
wynwood community to look into reasons for the rioting which 
police and city officials admitted caught them by surprise 
merchants complained that police took too long more than two 
hours to move in monday night after hundreds of youths swarmed 
through usually tranquil streets looting stores and burning down 
businesses 
the riot followed acquittal of six police officers accused of 
beating to death leonardo mercado a puerto ricanborn cocaine 
dealer 
the police knew it was going to happen and they just sat back 
and did nothing absolutely nothing said richard munoz who owns 
los hispanos supermarket 
munoz said his small grocery store was not damaged because he 
scared off the looters 
i spent all night armed and on the roof munoz said 
other merchants were busy sweeping up broken glass and cleaning 
soot 
police estimate about 300 people were involved in the rioting at 
its height from 10 to 15 people were arrested on charges of 
disorderly conduct and inciting to riot said george law a police 
spokesman 
residents said many looters were not from their neighborhood 
but came in from other parts of the city to take advantage of the 
anger in the northwestern miami community 
the trouble began shortly after nightfall nearly six hours 
after a federal jury found the members of an elite drug squad 
innocent of conspiracy in the killing of mercado who was from the 
neighborhood 
the jury deadlocked on more serious charges of violating the 
civil rights of mercado when he was beaten to death two years ago 
and judge stanley marcus declared a mistrial 
the trials end set off the citys fifth riot in just more than 
a decade the first involving the usually lowprofile puerto rican 
community rather than black neighborhoods 
mercados sisterinlaw rosa allende said some puerto ricans 
feel the need for revenge 
its not going to change things but its a start to let them 
know its not only the blacks who get angry she said they 
said he mercado was a lowlife cockroach but he had children a 
life is a life 
some business owners said they got telephone calls in the 
afternoon warning them there might be trouble and to close down 
their shops 
they the police knew all about it said ricky perez whose 
parents shoe store was vandalized 
we called the police and they told us to close down the store 
and go home they the police were just down the streets watching 
them taking tvs and they didnt do nothing about it perez said 
suarez conceded the police did not react swiftly enough but he 
said officials did not expect the number of people involved from 
other parts of the city 
we were caught a little bit by surprise suarez said 
were going to have to investigate and see if it wasnt some 
sort of predisposed or preorganized element to this 
anderson agreed the 200member riot squad came in too late but 
he noted that in a recent confrontation with haitian demonstrators 
police were criticized for moving in too quickly 
with this particular situation we took two hours to respond 
and we should have gone in a lot quicker anderson said so 
what im saying is youre damned if you do and damned if you 
dont 
fire investigator john calpini said two stores were destroyed by 
fire other damage appeared limited to a few buildings 
patrick gerrits wiped away tears as he watched investigators 
rummaging through the rubble of his familys construction company 
gerrits company which was hardest hit operated in the same 
spot since his father started it in 1946 
they just about killed my daddy when they burned this 
building gerrits said and itll probably kill my mama the 
whole highlight of her life was coming in here every day

why did dinosaurs disappear scientists 
wrote 2000 studies blaming asteroids volcanoes slow climate 
change or even constipation researchers said tuesday they think 
they found the smoking gun a 110milewide impact crater in 
mexico 
but dont bet the 12yearlong debate is over 
earlier evidence suggests other asteroids or comets struck earth 
near manson iowa and in the caribbean off colombia or cuba when 
the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago 
some scientists say certain basalt rock deposits around the 
world suggest another object also smacked into the planet to help 
trigger mass extinction 
we think we have found the smoking gun but there may be other 
guns and maybe a firing squad said bill boynton of the 
university of arizona at tucson 
the latest theory came during the american geophysical unions 
fall meeting the convention of 4400 earth scientists leans 
heavily toward the theory that killer asteroids sent dinosaurs to 
oblivion 
the idea is that an incoming 6milewide asteroid or comet or 
a shower of them smacked into the earth with the force of 70 
million onemegaton bombs kicking debris into the atmosphere and 
causing radical environmental damage that wiped out the dinosaurs 
and up to 75 percent of all living species 
some researchers think the impacts blocked out sunlight wiping 
out food supplies others theorized somewhat in jest that changes 
in vegetation upset the dinosaurs diet leaving them fatally 
constipated 
other possible deadly effects of asteroids hitting earth include 
acid rain giant tidal waves dark freezing weather global warming 
by the greenhouse effect and worldwide forest fires said geologist 
walter alvarez of the university of california at berkeley who 
helped start the debate in 1978 
jay melosh of the university of arizona said worldwide soot 
deposits support the fire theory he believes a single asteroid 
plowed into the earth and sent molten rock droplets skyward where 
they heated the atmosphere and caused 700degree surface 
temperatures 
its enough heat to ignite vegetation melosh said 
unprotected animals would have been broiled in their tracks 
alvarez his father the late nobel laureate physicist luis w 
alvarez and others found deposits of 65millionyearold iridium 
metal in rocks around the world iridium is rare on earth but less 
rare in asteroids and comets the killerasteroid theory was born 
because an impact would have spread iridium dust around the globe 
some researchers still argue the dinosaurs were rendered extinct 
by gradual natural climate changes or by climate disruption from 
huge volcanic eruptions they demanded asteroid advocates show 
where the object or objects hit earth 
the 22milewide crater in iowa was created by an impact that 
probably wasnt large enough to cause mass extinction alvarez 
said 
last may alan hildebrand boynton and others in arizona 
proposed one culprit impact crater in the caribbean off colombias 
coast as evidence they cited rock deposits in haiti and the us 
gulf coast caused by asteroidinduced rock fallout and 3milehigh 
tidal waves 
in their latest study presented by boynton they propose 
another asteroid struck shallow mexican waters the impact site is 
a 110milewide crater now covered by sediment on the coast of 
mexicos yucatan peninsula near the town of chicxulub the crater 
contains oncemelted rock and shocked quartz grains that indicate 
something jolted the shallow sea floor 
boynton called the site ground zero but said another 
asteroid probably hit offshore from columbia others say there was 
in impact near cuba 
brown universitys peter schultz said laboratory studies show a 
single 6milewide asteroid hitting earth at a 15degree angle 
could have broken into 1000 smaller pieces that caused a series of 
impact craters 
alvarez said there also must be other impacts because some 
debris found in worldwide rock deposits contains tiny balls of 
basalt glass that couldnt have come from an asteroid smacking into 
iowa or the yucatan 
alvarez said the debate is so important it has generated 2000 
studies since 1978 
we wouldnt be here if it hadnt been for the extinction of 
the dinosaurs alvarez said they were ruling the place 
mammals were just running around underfoot until the impact killed 
the dinosaurs and let us evolve 
but if a huge asteroid impact happened today it would cause the 
extinction of the human race said ronald prinn of the 
massachusetts institute of technology

authorities will seek a murder indictment 
in the 1982 death of a woman who was struck by a stray bullet 
during an alleged drugwar shootout a prosecutor said 
the slaying of dennison university student laura carter was the 
inspiration for the popular song think of laura by christopher 
cross 
james w smith 52 had been charged with complicity and 
conspiracy to commit murder but those charges were dropped monday 
doug stead assistant franklin county prosecutor said he and 
another assistant prosecutor decided to seek an indictment on the 
more severe charge of murder they dismissed the conspiracy charge 
because smith cannot be charged twice for the same crime he said 
common pleas judge michael close ordered the complicity charge 
dropped because it wasnt filed within six years the statute of 
limitations 
smith was arrested in 1988 on the conspiracy charge he was 
released from jail and failed to appear for trial he later was 
indicted on the complicity charge 
ms carter an 18yearold student from wayne pa was riding 
in a car with her father on a columbus street when she was shot 
april 17 1982 
police believe that smith and three other men were trying to 
kill two members of a rival drug gang when a stray bullet struck 
ms carter smiths gang was upset over the other gangs efforts to 
move in on the citys drug trade according to court documents 
gordon c newlin and norman whiteside two of the three men who 
allegedly were with smith have been sentenced to prison terms of 
seven to 25 years for conspiracy to commit aggravated murder 
another defendant paul newlin is charged with aggravated 
murder involuntary manslaughter conspiracy to commit aggravated 
murder and felonious assault

as charles h keatings savings and loan 
hurtled toward failure two of the keating five senators pushed 
hard for a sale rather than a government takeover of the 
institution a former chief sampl regulator testified tuesday 
m danny wall told senate ethics committee hearings that sen 
alan cranston contacted him four times and sen dennis deconcini at 
least twice to urge that regulators not seize lincoln savings and 
loan 
wall focused on activities of cranston and deconcini from the 
beginning of january through midapril 1989 a hectic period when 
the federal home loan bank board considered and rejected three 
proposed sales of lincoln regulators took over the keatingowned 
irvine calif thrift that april 14 
the former regulator said cranston told him that day 
something to the effect that i think the board has made a 
mistake i hope you are right 
two years before the seizure regulators told cranston 
dcalif deconcini dariz and three other senators that criminal 
referrals on lincoln were being forwarded to the justice 
department testimony in the hearings has shown that only the two 
senators contacted the bank board after that 
the three other senators whose conduct is being investigated by 
the ethics committee are donald w riegle jr dmich john glenn 
dohio and john mccain rariz 
the committee is in its 11th day of hearings to determine 
whether the five senators improperly intervened for keating with 
banking regulators in return for 13 million he and associates 
donated to theircampaigns and causes 
deconcini and cranston said they contacted wall about a sale 
because they were trying to save jobs at the thrift and at its 
parent company american continental corp which is based in 
phoenix 
wall said that cranston urged the board to give prompt 
consideration and approval to any legitimate proposals for the 
sale of lincoln deconcini he testified sought prompt 
consideration but did not state that a particular proposal be 
accepted 
wall said all three offers were rejected by the bank board or 
its staff because keating was not entirely separated from the 
buyers and it appeared the new lincoln would not be able to survive 
economically 
the former regulator now a private financial consultant said 
i dont recall any discussion where details were discussed with 
the senators 
wall said cranston called him three times and they met april 7 
1989 just a week before the takeover deconcini called april 7 and 
again on april 11 wall said and added there may have been a third 
contact with the arizonan not reflected in his records 
in a sworn statement to the committee wall said on nov 7 i 
have stated many times that my decisions regarding lincoln were not 
influenced by mr keating sen cranston or sen deconcini 
wall responded no when sen jesse helms rnc asked if 
any of the senators pressured him to act in a particular way in 
his nov 7 statement wall said the large number of calls by 
cranston between 1987 and 1989 was unusual but not improper 
wall who formerly worked for sen jake garn rutah was asked 
whether his former boss would have made the number of calls that 
cranston did to regulators 
sen garn wouldnt have done it others certainly do he 
testified 
during the same january to april period keating was pushing 
hard for approval of a sale wall quoted keating as asking for an 
appointment in january 1989 to discuss a subject that was 
according to keating the culmination of my life maybe my 
fortune 
when the meeting took place on jan 17 wall said keating 
indicated he was trying to sell lincoln and that it was not wise 
for him to get into a regulated business he wanted to get out of 
the business 
cranston told the committee according to the transcript of his 
closeddoor testimony on may 17 that he never inquired about 
details of the proposed sales 
all i wanted them the bank board members to do was to make 
sure they didnt block a sale just because they were down on 
keating and wanted some people may have wanted to drive him out 
of business rather than let him sell his way out of the business 
cranston didnt identify the subjects of his remarks but has 
been highly critical of walls predecessor as bank board chairman 
edwin j gray gray has been the chief accuser of the five 
senators saying they improperly intervened with him on keatings 
behalf keating has said gray was prejudiced against lincoln

an ambitious effort to overhaul the 
world trading system appeared on the verge of collapse tuesday as 
pressure built on european countries to compromise in their fight 
against major farm subsidy cuts 
some european officials indicated they were willing to offer 
more agriculture subsidy cuts although it was uncertain whether 
any new offer would be enough to satisfy us negotiators 
the 12nation european community had staunchly resisted a 
usbacked proposal to slash export subsidies by 90 percent and 
reduce internal support payments and market barriers by 75 percent 
over the next decade 
many third world countries viewed lower farm barriers as their 
no 1 priority in the discussions 
the talks known as the uruguay round since they began in 1986 
in the south american nation seek to dismantle barriers to trade 
in agricultural products manufactured goods and the fastgrowing 
area of services such as banking and insurance 
we have a very large stalemate in agriculture and that is 
unfortunate said a disappointed us trade representative carla 
hills 
rufus yerxa one of hills top aides said negotiations are 
very close to collapse 
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said even 
if the farm issue is resolved it was unlikely a final trade 
agreement could be completed on schedule this week 
he suggested another meeting would be necessary possibly in 
january with lowerlevel negotiators involved 
a total of 107 nations are participating in the discussions 
which had been scheduled to wrap up with five days of marathon 
bargaining this week at the heysel palaces a vast exhibition 
complex on the outskirts of brussels 
facing the prospect that these talks could fail officials from 
germany said tuesday they were now campaigning with ec members for 
more flexibility on agriculture subsididies 
germanys change of position just two days after national 
elections could represent a significant breakthrough the germans 
had been one of the major opponents of farm subsidy cuts 
but there was no indication that france and ireland two other 
strong supporters of the subsidies had softened their position 
assistant german economics minister lorenz schomerus did not 
give any details on what level of subsidy cuts the germans would 
support 
at present the ec is offering what would amount to a 15 percent 
reduction in internal price supports 
other members of the ec include belgium denmark greece 
italy luxembourg the netherlands britain spain and portugal 
us officials held out hope that a meeting in paris on 
wednesday between german chancellor helmut kohl and french 
president francois mitterrand might produce a change in frances 
opposition as well 
the meeting was officially called to discuss next weeks summit 
of european community leaders in rome but it was likely the two 
leaders would take up the farm question 
the bush administration has estimated a successful trade 
agreement would help reduce americas huge trade deficits still 
running at nearly 100 billion a year by boosting export 
opportunities for us farmers and businesses 
president bush who is on a trip to south america said 
wednesday we must use this meeting to find the political will to 
limit or reduce distortions in trade 
bush in the past has lobbied other heads of state to support the 
talks which the administration has made its top trade priority 
however us negotiators have found little progress in the 
first two days of talks in brussels 
for all practical purposes two days of negotiations here in 
brussels have been wasted in so far as agriculture is concerned and 
there are not that many days left said agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter 
negotiators in the other 14 areas of the talks also reported 
little progress 
i have seen no real movements from entrenched positions in any 
of the major areas uruguayan foreign minister hector gros 
espiell the chairman of the trade talks said tuesday night i 
feel that we need substantial breakthroughs if this meeting is 
to end with a package of results truly meaningful for all 
participants

the leader of the major opposition 
coalition of anticommunists acknowledged on tuesday that he had 
worked as a police informer under the discredited former hardline 
marxist regime 
peter beron chief of the 16party union of democratic forces 
was reacting to charges earlier tuesday that he and 70 other 
parliamentarians collaborated with the police under the toppled 
communist leadership beron had said monday that he wanted to 
return to work as a zoologist and planned to leave politics 
on tuesday beron told state radio he informed on foreign 
visitors to the museum of natural history while in charge of the 
museums international relations department during the 1980s 
but he denied working for the sixth department the feared 
political police section that spied on bulgarians seen as a threat 
to the communist leadership he said his activities were normal 
practice in every normal state 
i never was a member of the communist party unlike many who 
now accuse me beron said alluding to former marxists who went 
over to the opposition in the last year after bulgarias communist 
dictatorship crumbled 
beron spoke from budapest hungary en route to bulgaria he 
insisted that his police activities served the state and not the 
communist party 
hours after union leader konstantin trenchev leveled his 
accusations parliament voted overwhelmingly to ask the interior 
ministry to hand over files to a special legislative committee 
within a week on all legislators who had worked with the secret 
police 
socialist premier andrei lukanov and his government of former 
communists were toppled last friday by a udf boycott of the 
legislature prolonged street demonstrations and a general strike 
called by the podkrepa trade union federation lukanovs 
administration came under fire largely because of its links with 
the former communist system the communists changed their name to 
the bulgarian socialist party after the old regime fell 
the former communists won june elections but saw their 
popularity fade as economic troubles mounted bulgaria now rations 
basic foods and energy 
the socialists are negotiating the makeup of a new government 
with the udf 
trenchev chairman of podkrepa said in an interview our 
union has a list with 71 names of deputies who were employees of 
the former secret police these people must leave parliament 
he said 54 of the deputies were socialists and 17 were members 
of the udf including beron 
the allegations were likely to split the opposition at a time 
when it needs unity in its bid for a major share of power in a new 
government and to further polarize parliament that could make it 
harder to approve economic reforms needed to bring bulgaria out of 
its worst postworld war ii economic crisis 
in separate comments the state bta news agency quoted trenchev 
as saying beron has been an informer of the thought police 
of the totalitarian regime 
prominent members of the udf refused to dismiss allegations of 
further police informers in their ranks 
i cannot exclude the possibility that a whole bunch of our 
people were employees of the security police in the past and 
continue in such functions even today alexander yordanov said in 
an interview 
in such a case the communist party remains in power in 
bulgaria and the system remains totalitarian he said 
unlike other east bloc countries where communists were ousted 
by popular pressure reformist communists toppled bulgarias 
longtime communist strongman todor zhivkov in november 1989 
the former communists now socialists are widely considered 
the heirs of a bankrupt communist system that was based on police 
state controls a centralized economy and dependence on moscow

congress should limit funding of the navys 
487 billion seawolf attack submarine which is plagued by 
financial and technical problems rooted in its computer system a 
house committee report says 
the vessel is perhaps the most conspicuous and potentially 
most costly example of a program struggling with the problems of 
adapting stateoftheart computer technology into a 
multibilliondollar weapons platform the government operations 
committee said in its report scheduled for release wednesday 
it recommends that congress limit funding for construction of 
additional seawolf submarines until the pentagon clarifies the 
programs mission and provides assurances that the computer 
problems will be fixed 
spokesman lt greg smith said the navy would have no immediate 
comment 
pentagon plans call for building 29 of the ships for 487 
billion with the first scheduled for completion in 1995 the 
seawolf is billed as the largest quietest and most heavily armed 
nuclear attack submarines 
a key component of the seawolf is its bsy2 computerized combat 
system general electric is under contract to develop three of the 
systems 
the report said testimony at committee hearings revealed that 
more than 800 people will be needed to develop the software 
programs for the seawolf and integrate an estimated 32 million 
lines of code the contractor the report said was having trouble 
finding qualified workers for the task 
the navy has a dismal track record on combat computer system 
acquisition the report said it said the policy was based on a 
buy now fix later philosophy under which the navy purchases 
components before all the problems are worked out 
the navy is developing bsy2 separately from the rest of the 
seawolf on the premise that the combat system will be ready for 
installation when the rest of the submarine is completed said 
government operations chairman john conyers dmich 
this did not work with previous class submarines and there is 
no reason to believe it will work now he said

madonna a master at making videos that generate 
almost as much controversy as they do record sales wants to know 
why violence is acceptable for television and steamy sex scenes are 
not 
madonna appeared on abctvs nightline early tuesday in an 
interview just after the news program aired her toohotformtv 
video justify my love in its entirety 
the video rejected by mtv last week features the 
braandgarterbeltclad singer in an encounter with a lover 
played by her reallife boyfriend tony ward in a paris hotel 
the video is intended to portray the couples fantasies which 
run to bisexuality voyeurism group sex crossdressing and mild 
sadomasochism 
she told interviewer forrest sawyer via satellite from los 
angeles that the video with its chains black leather and 
crucifixes was about honesty and the celebration of sex 
theres nothing wrong with that 
but she said she thought there was a double standard at work on 
television 
why are we willing to deal with the reality of violence and 
sexism and why arent we willing to deal with sexuality she 
asked 
the appearance got the show its highest overnight ratings this 
year abc said tuesday 
the 30minute show averaged a 102 rating in overnight ac 
nielsen co ratings from 25 cities those ratings represent nearly 
half of the nations 931 million tv households 
the programs national ratings wont be in until next week but 
abc projects that they also will be the highest this year for 
nightline said spokeswoman laura wessner 
mondays show was preceded by abcs telecast of the san 
francisco 49ersnew york giants football game which very likely 
helped the nightline ratings by giving the show a big leadin 
audience wessner said 
mondays nightline marked the first time a major network had 
run madonnas muchpublicized video without first censoring parts 
of it but the videos first uncensored national telecast was 
thursday when it was shown on the jukebox network an interactive 
cable network 
despite the appearance of madonna and her video on 
nightline the shows ratings champion probably will remain ted 
koppels may 27 1987 interview of fallen tv evangelist jim bakker 
and bakkers wife tammy 
that onehour special broadcast averaged an 114 national

for years pharmacist edward kilkeary used 
arthritis medication saline solution and sterilizing equipment to 
whip up hundreds of tiny bottles of specially prescribed eye drops 
for cataract patients 
but sometime this year something went wrong 
two women last month each lost an eye to a virulent bacteria at 
least 10 people were hospitalized with infections and countless 
others sought help for swelling and burning caused by a toxin that 
was eating away their eyes 
the bacteria pseudomonas contaminated an unknown number of 
bottles that were sold under the name indocin to patients who had 
recently undergone cataract surgery the infection puzzled doctors 
who treated the patients and the drops were traced to hiebers 
drug store where kilkeary manufactured them 
a pharmacy is a place where people put their trust like their 
docs like their priests said dr robert lewen of allegheny 
general hospital where eight people were treated when that 
trust is violated i think people seem to be somewhat resentful 
this was not supposed to be the way things work 
state and federal agencies investigated but answers have been 
hampered by poor records the sale of the drug to other pharmacies 
and doctors and conflicting information from kilkeary said ron 
howard of the state health department 
kilkeary has refused to be interviewed 
district attorney robert colville said tuesday that 
investigators lack hard evidence to warrant the filing of criminal 
charges against hiebers or kilkeary because there is no proof of 
gross wanton and willful disregard for the safety of others 
but howard said he has one of the tightest cases hes seen 
in 25 years and will try to pursue prosecution with other 
authorities if colville decides not to take it 
theres more than one way of handling legal action howards 
boss jack ogun director of the health departments bureau of 
drugs devices and cosmetics said tuesday 
colville characterized the evidence as technical violations 
which he called bureaucratic nitpicking 
its selective enforcement looking at somebody after the 
fact he said if they had been enforcing these regulations and 
hiebers failed to comply id say fine but theres no evidence 
they did that that kind of enforcement the court looks at with a 
jaundiced eye 
the patients who experienced the worst problems ranged in age 
from 55 to 78 and took the drops after undergoing cataract surgery 
when their wounds were fresh giving the bacteria access to 
sensitive tissues 
two women had to have their eyes removed because of irreversible 
infections from the drops lewen said 
their eyes were blind painful and cosmetically unacceptable 
ugly red and draining the pain was as unrelenting as toothache 
pain lewen said he also said there was a small risk the 
infection could spread to the brain 
indocin is an antiinflammatory drug produced by merck sharp amp 
dohme for pain caused by diseases such as arthritis at least 15 
pittsburgharea doctors have legally prescribed it to reduce 
swelling after eye surgery howard said 
indocin has not been approved by the food and drug 
administration for use as eye drops but such use is not illegal 
hiebers is believed to be the only pharmacy in the area that 
manufactures the drops which are sold in halfounce bottles for 
about 15 
howard said kilkeary made up to 2000 bottles a year and either 
sold the medication outright to patients with prescriptions or for 
resale to doctors and other pharmacies in violation of state 
pharmaceutical regulations 
because kilkeary wasnt registered as a drug manufacturer there 
was no inspection of his facilities and methods which howard 
called extremely primitive 
he said kilkeary used an autoclave a pressurized vessel used 
for sterilization but couldnt answer questions about the amount 
of heat or pressure applied to kill bacteria 
recent eye surgery patients with indocin eye drops or drops 
that contain the generic ingredient indomethacin have been warned 
not to use them 
henry henrich a 65yearold from mckeesport who was treated for 
infection in one eye has sued for 20000 and more lawsuits are 
anticipated 
you have a guy making moonshine in the back yard and selling 
it as medicine said his attorney samuel cordes the methods 
they were using are so primitive that its kind of surprising it 
hasnt happened before

the us and canadian governments bungled the 
probe of a crash that killed 256 american servicemen and may be 
concealing a possible terrorist connection a congressional panel 
was told tuesday 
rep robin tallon dsc told the house judiciary subcommittee 
on crime that federal agencies appear to be guilty of ineptness 
or the bestcontrived coverup ever in the dec 12 1985 
crash in gander newfoundland 
the dc8 carrying us peacekeeping troops home from the middle 
east crashed less than 30 seconds after takeoff 
incredibly no us government agency or at least none with 
official responsibility demonstrated any determination to find out 
just what caused the crash said subcommittee chairman william 
hughes dnj 
the national transportation safety board and other agencies 
of the us government chose to sit back and watch as the canadian 
efforts became embroiled in controversy hughes said the ntsb 
routinely rubberstamped the canadian findings 
the canadian investigation attributed the probable cause of the 
crash to ice on the wings of the chartered military jet 
a subcommittee staff report that formed the basis for tuesdays 
hearing said there was no evidence that either the united states or 
canada had seriously investigated possible terrorism 
eyewitnesses say they saw a bright orange object in the sky at 
the time of the crash suggesting the plane was on fire 
an anonymous caller later said that islamic jihad a proiranian 
terrorist group had put a bomb on the plane 
when a terrorist organization took credit for this 
abomination why was this claim not investigated and a report made 
to the american people asked retired army col lewis millett 
millett a medal of honor winner wiped his eyes as he spoke of 
his son a soldier in the armys 101st airborne division who died 
in the crash 
the theory of ice on the wings is preposterous said lt 
filotas a canadian aeronautical engineer who served on the 
investigating panel and dissented from the majoritys finding 
filotas said the fivemember majority of the canadian board 
refused to set aside the ice theory long enough to investigate 
other possibilities 
tallon and others suggest the plane might have been blown up by 
terrorists in connection with the irancontra affair the reagan 
administration authorized a shipment of hawk missiles to iran less 
than three weeks before the plane crashed 
the missiles werent the kind the iranians were expecting and 
the iranians felt they had been duped according to computer 
messages from former white house aide oliver north the messages 
were uncovered by the irancontra committees 
in retaliation terrorists might have planted an explosive 
device aboard the plane said dr jd phillips a pathologist 
whose only son was killed in the crash 
the man who piloted the plane on the first leg of its journey to 
cairo egypt told the fbi he believed it experienced structural 
failure or that a bomb exploded on takeoff the pilot also told the 
fbi that the egyptian army guard assigned to the plane while it was 
on the ground disappeared from his post several times 
the fbi and the royal canadian mounted police found very 
serious allegations but that information apparently wasnt turned 
over to the canadian panel investigating the crash tallon said 
the fbi said it has no reason to question the accuracy of the 
canadian findings 
no credible evidence has surfaced suggesting the charter 
flight by miamibased arrow air crashed was the result of an act of 
terrorism nicholas ohara deputy assistant director for criminal 
investigations at the fbi said in prepared testimony 
arrow air was one of the subcontractors that hauled weapons to 
the contras for oliver norths secret resupply network it operated 
in 1985 and 1986 during a congressional ban on us military aid to 
the rebel force

darkhorse presidential candidate 
stanislaw tyminski on tuesday led miners in chants of down with 
walesa in a return to one of his bases of support the rally 
however was frequently disrupted by hecklers 
tyminski an emigre businessman who returned to poland after 21 
years made a homestretch campaign trip into the mining region of 
silesia where he did well in the first round of voting nov 25 
tyminski said solidarity leader lech walesa is finished 
despite polls that show walesa ahead by a 21 margin for sundays 
runoff election to pick polands first popularly chosen president 
but tyminski said his own polls put walesas support at 50 
percent and his at 44 percent and growing 
the 90minute rally before about 3000 people turned tense when 
about 500 walesa supporters began to jeer tyminski who placed 
second in the firstround voting there were shouting matches 
between the camps and several fistfights 
tuesday was the feast of st barbara patron saint of miners 
and was a holiday many of the miners were drinking before the 
rally in jastrzebie about 225 miles south of warsaw 
we are millions tyminski said shortly after arriving on 
stage to a din of boos and cheers now a new decade begins and 
this decade belongs to us 
after being interrupted by chants of kgb and back to 
peru tyminski his peruvianborn wife graciela and their 
supporters responded with down with walesa 
i think he can hear it in gdansk tyminski said referring 
to the birthplace of solidarity let him feel our power like we 
could feel his power for the past 10 years 
how much hatred there is for walesa in our country he said 
especially here in silesia why didnt he come here 
tyminski claimed he turned down an invitation tuesday night to 
meet with us defense secretary dick cheney who is visiting 
poland 
a us source confirmed tyminski was on the guest list for an 
embassy reception for cheney but said there was no meeting 
planned cheney is traveling to gdansk on wednesday to see walesa 
tyminski has promised to quickly improve polands economy and 
has blamed many of its problems on walesa and prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki who was eliminated from the presidential race 
by placing third in the first round 
but tyminski has also been criticized for his leadership of the 
fringe libertarian party of canada his advocacy of nuclear 
weapons his long absence from his country and his reported use of 
hallucinogens while living in an amazonian river city in peru in 
the early 1980s he denied any use of drugs tuesday 
tyminski supporters at the rally called walesa a traitor under 
the communists miners were treated as a royalty among workers 
earning twice the national average now many fear for their jobs as 
moneylosing mines face closure or bankruptcy 
fiftyeight coal mines are losing money or cannot pay taxes this 
year while 12 will show a profit the government reported tuesday 
walesa betrayed us he has no support in silesia said 
miner mieczyslaw kupko who got tyminski to autograph a copy of his 
selfpublished book of political thoughts titled sacred dogs 
walesa is so fat because he grows on miners money agreed 
legina sadej tyminski can give us more 
but the solidarity leader also had loyalists in the hall who 
believe tyminski has ties to the communist party deposed from power 
by solidarity in 1989 
we have to save poland against tyminski said emilia 
bargiel she said she was ashamed that she voted for tyminski in 
the first round 
nobody knew the truth about tyminski but finally the 
journalists found out too late for many people she said 
referring to reports that former communists and secret police are 
aiding tyminskis bid 
earlier tuesday tyminski charged there were secret police 
agents among prominent solidarity activists 
tyminski repeated that he is a practicing roman catholic 93 
percent of poles consider themselves catholics and said it would 
be up to the church to judge his decision to divorce and have 
children out of wedlock 
cardinal jozef glemp leader of polands roman catholic church 
has urged followers to vote for walesa one newspaper reported 
tuesday 
of the election walesa said in a radio talk show i dont 
believe mr tyminski has a chance but he was needed as a lesson in 
democracy

president jose eduardo dos santos on 
tuesday told his party its political monopoly will soon end and 
said it must abandon marxist economics to embrace the free market 
and democratic socialism 
dos santos was unanimously reelected president of the popular 
movement for the liberation of angola at its third congress but 
faces resistance to his reform plans from mpla hardliners the 
sixday congress opened tuesday and is scheduled to debate 
proposals for reforming the centralized economy and introducing 
multiparty democracy 
the 700 delegates will also discuss the continuing peace talks 
with usbacked unita rebels to end a 15yearold civil war that 
has devastated what is potentially one of africas richest 
economies 
dos santos told delegates this congress may be the last under 
a singleparty system 
his halfhour speech was interrupted by frequent applause 
the president criticized the centrally planned economic system 
followed by the mpla since angolas independence from portugal in 
1975 
the inadequacy of the system is showing in an economic 
asphyxiation because of the high level of collectivism of the means 
of production and services he said 
he also said political advances will be difficult while the war 
continues with unita the national union for the total independence 
of angola 
portuguese government mediators said after a fifth round of 
peace talks between the two sides last month that they were close 
to a ceasefire talks are expected to resume next month 
gen juliao mateus paulo deputy chief of staff of the angolan 
armed forces criticized the united states for its continued 
support of unita rebels 
he told the congress on tuesday that the bush administration 
appears to be trying to take advantage of the new international 
situation by promoting instability in countries like angola 
in october congress passed an administration proposal for a 60 
million us military aid package to the rebels 
it approved an amendment saying part of the aid may be suspended 
if angolas government carries out its pledge to introduce a 
pluralist system and halts arms purchases from the soviet union 
us and soviet observers have attended the peace talks in 
portugal 
mateus paulo is new chairman of a commission to overhaul the 
southern african states constitution in preparation for multiparty 
democracy he told deputies the armed forces role will be 
radically altered in angolas shift from oneparty rule 
removing existing close links between the mpla and the army and 
integrating government forces with unita guerrillas are among the 
toughest issues on the agenda of the peace talks 
dos santos said tuesday political advances will be difficult 
while the war continues with unita the national union for the 
total independence of angola 
he has said plans to introduce a multiparty system will go ahead 
early next year even without an agreement with the rebels 
angola is rich in minerals and agricultural land but the war 
has crippled economic activity and severed communications only 
exports from the heavily guarded northwestern oil fields have kept 
the economy afloat

house democrats on a vote of 17737 adopted 
a policy statement late tuesday which declared president bush 
should take no military action against iraq without prior approval 
from congress except to protect american lives from imminent 
endangerment 
the democratic caucus debated the nonbinding declaration for 
two hours amending it in the end to include language supporting 
the presidents diplomatic initiatives in the gulf crisis but the 
admonition to bush to seek congressional approval for making war 
is a statement by the democratic caucus that we want the 
constitution respected on this crucial point said rep norman 
lent dwash 
earlier former defense secretary robert s mcnamara testified 
to a senate committee that prior approval from congress and the 
public for making war against iraq should be a lesson heeded from 
vietnam and a republican senator agreed that if we start having 
body bags coming back we will have a very serious revolt if the 
president orders americans into combat without that approval 
mcnamara who was lyndon b johnsons defense secretary at the 
height of us involvement in vietnam told the senate foreign 
relations committee the administration should continue to rely upon 
economic sanctions as the main weapon against iraq for a year or 
more 
in uruguay bush took issue with the parade of congressional 
witnesses who have argued for patience with the sanctions strategy 
ive not been one whose been convinced that sanctions alone will 
bring him to his senses bush said of iraqi leader saddam 
hussein 
two other former pentagon leaders gen david jones and adm 
william crowe had suggested earlier that bush give the sanctions 
up to 18 months to work as to that bush said i dont agree with 
them i cant say how long but i dont agree with them 
mcnamara meanwhile asked the senate committee who can doubt 
that a year of blockade will be cheaper than a week of war 
asked to compare the situation with vietnam mcnamara said i 
do not believe the president should and i do not believe he will 
initiate action without the approval of the american people 
expressed by the approval of the congress 
several committee members meanwhile indicated they had not 
been swayed by defense secretary dick cheneys argument to the 
senate armed services committee a day earlier that the 
international sanctions against iraq were likely to prove futile 
sometimes there is more toughness in patience than in lashing 
out this is such a time said sen paul simon dill a member 
of the foreign relations panel 
republican sen larry pressler of south dakota said americans 
want peace if we start having body bags come back we will have 
a very serious revolt in terms of public opinion he warned 
and sen daniel patrick moynihan dny added we have time 
i dont see any hurry i dont see any doubt that he either gets 
out or he gets thrown out blown out 
across the capitol house armed services chairman les aspin 
dwis opened yet another gulf policy hearing set to last three 
weeks by observing the country is united on ends but divided on 
means 
aspin who has supported bushs latest troop deployments agreed 
that action that isnt backed by consensus will mean disaster 
whatever we do the country the congress and the president must do 
it standing on common ground 
the house panel heard jerrold m post founder of the cias 
center for the analysis of personality and political behavior say 
that saddam is a judicious political calculator who is by no 
means irrational but is dangerous to the extreme 
post now a professor at george washington university said it 
is this political personality constellation meassianic ambition 
for unlimited power absence of conscience unconstrained 
aggression and a paranoid outlook which make saddam so 
dangerous 
in making his argument for sanctions moynihan said iraq relies 
on imports for items as basic as its own currency holding up 
several iraqi dinars he noted that they are printed in london and 
wear out in about 12 months 
later speaking with reporters moynihan observed that bush had 
enjoyed unstinting congressional support until nov 8 when the 
administration announced a new troop buildup to achieve an 
offensive capability since then democrats have urged bush to rely 
more on sanctions and diplomacy than on military force 
but sen rudy boschwitz rminn agreed with cheneys 
conclusion that a promise of time to let the sanctions work also 
amounted to a reprieve in pressure on iraq that would let saddam 
husband resources and build military strength 
if he is able to hold off the entire world for two years 
saddam hussein will be seen as the new nasser of the middle east 
boschwitz said in a reference to the egyptian arab leader of the 
1960s 
but mcnamara said those who focus on the costs of a prolonged 
embargo fail to see the costs of immediate military action 
if we carry on sanctions for 12 to 18 months theres no 
question we risk fracturing the unity of the international 
coalition lined up against iraq he said 
but i can tell you its hardly a risk its almost a 
certainty that if we undertake military action there will be a 
fracture of the unity 
there are divisive forces in the arab world they are going to 
be fed by the initiation of military action that is going to appear 
to many in the arab world to be the unilateral action of the united 
states it is a far lesser risk than the loss of thousands of 
american lives

president bush on tuesday rejected 
recommendations from former pentagon chiefs to give sanctions 
against iraq at least a year to work a uruguayan leader urged bush 
to have infinite patience before resorting to military force 
bush on the second day of a salutetodemocracy tour across 
south america said he was not convinced sanctions alone would 
bring iraqs saddam hussein to his senses 
oil prices driven up by the gulf crisis have devastated many 
countries economies he said vowing this is not going to go on 
forever 
back in washington house democrats voted 17737 in caucus for a 
nonbinding resolution telling bush he must first get permission 
from congress before sending troops into battle 
former defense secretary robert s mcnamara added his voice to 
the witnesses before the senate foreign relations committee urging 
caution in the usled effort to force iraq to relinquish its hold 
on kuwait 
who can doubt that a year of blockade will be cheaper than a 
week of war asked mcnamara who led the us military buildup in 
vietnam 
even in montevideo restraint was urged upon bush uruguays 
vice president exhorted bush to exercise infinite patient in 
making a judgment in the gulf crisis 
if the decision is for war perhaps we will not justify it but 
we will certainly understand it said gonzalo aguirre in 
introducing bush to the uruguays congress several lefist deputies 
and senators boycotted the speech and 400 demonstrators protested 
outside 
bush at an earlier news conference with president luis alberto 
lacalle said saddam has not gotten the message so far that he 
must withdraw from kuwait or he will be forced out 
the united nations resolution authorizing force against iraq 
unless it withdraws from kuwait by jan 15 was loud and clear 
bush said but i dont think saddam hussein yet understands 
that 
the best hope for peace is for him to understand that all 
means all means necessary to fulfill these resolutions will be 
used against him bush said 
the persian gulf crisis was at the top of his agenda as bush 
arrived here from brazil on the second day of his weeklong tour of 
south america 
the house democrats resolution states that he must get 
congressional permission before taking offensive action in the gulf 
except to protect american lives from imminent endangerment 
mcnamara testified that bush should not act without the 
approval of the american people expressed by the approval of the 
congress 
a republican senator larry pressler of south dakota concurred 
saying if we start having body bags come back we will have a 
very serious revolt in terms of public opinion 
we have time i dont see any hurry said sen daniel 
patrick moynihan dny either saddam gets out or he gets 
thrown out blown out 
bush firmly rejected suggestions from two former chairmen of the 
joint chiefs gen david jones and adm william crowe that he 
give sanctions against iraq up to 18 months to work before 
resorting to force senate democrats also have urged bush to stick 
with the sanctions 
i dont agree with them bush said i cant say how long 
sanctions should be tested but i dont agree with them 
bush endorsed remarks sunday by secretary of state james a 
baker iii who said the united states would not attack iraq if it 
withdrew from kuwait and complied with all un peacemaking 
resolutions i did not have any problem with that at all the 
president said 
bush indicated he would take a tough stand when he meets at the 
white house with iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz on the gulf 
crisis he said he would not allow any linkage with the palestinian 
issue and israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
im not in a negotiating mood or anything of that nature when 
i meet with aziz bush said 
bush said the sanctions have been costly to uruguay as well as 
other countries as oil prices climbed and export markets to iraq 
and kuwait were closed 
and yet you never flinched your country never flinched you 
never wavered in support of these un sanctions bush the first 
american president to visit uruguay since lyndon johnson in 1967 
told the lawmakers 
on wednesday bush will head across the river platte to buenos 
aires mopping up from a failed revolt within the argentine 
military 
bush said he did not view mondays uprising as a sign that 
democracy is fragile in argentina he said he would salute 
president carlos menem for his leadership and economic reforms 
argentina has dispatched two warships to the persian gulf the 
only latin nation to join the multinational force opecmember 
venezuela the last stop on bushs trip has stepped up oil 
production to help fill the gap in world supplies 
bush opened his visit here by proclaiming a new era in 
uslatin american relations 
we in the americas are on the brink of something unprecedented 
in world history the first wholly democratic hemisphere bush 
said 
and in anticipation of that we need to create together a 
permanent partnership among all the nations of the americas he 
said 
bush and lacalle both spoke of the importance of lifting 
barriers to international trade including farm subsidies trade 
talks are now in their final days in brussels in the effort to 
rewrite the global trading rules last forged in uruguay in 1986 
we are in the same boat in this gatt negotiations said 
lacalle who said protectionist barriers and subsidies have hurt 
millions of people 
we foresee a whole hemisphere of much more open trade said 
bush who exhorted developing countries to move briskly to 
privatization to free markets in order to attract investments 
and new technology 
bush said we are not locked on a specific figure on how 
deeply farm subsidies should be cut we are locked on the fact 
that there has to be inclusion of all categories of products 
bush and lacalle later flew by helicopter to the ocean resort of 
punta del este 90 miles east of the capital where bush jogged on 
the beach and took a dip in the atlantic before dining with lacalle 
at a posh restaurant bush was spending the night in a luxurious 
private beachfront home 
after argentina bush flies to chile on thursday and venezuela 
on friday before heading home on saturday

cancer early has improved significantly since 1985 though slightly 
higher radiation is being used the food and drug administration 
said tuesday 
the greater radiation is justified by the improved quality of 
images the agency said the radiation is still within fda safety 
guidelines and is about twothirds lower than 1979 levels 
fda surveys of mammography equipment in 1985 showed that 36 
produced substandard images a survey by the agency in 1988 found 
the rate had declined to 13 percent 
i hope the surveys will encourage women to make greater use of 
mammography said dr james mason assistant secretary for health 
at the department of health and human services early detection 
and treatment offer women their best chance of surviving breast 
cancer 
the national cancer institute recommends that women over 40 have 
regular mammograms 
a report on the fdas surveys was published in the november 
issue of the journal radiology the agency said 
to test the xray machines used for mammography the fda uses a 
plastic device embedded with tiny objects this device is xrayed 
and the quality of the image is based on the number of the tiny 
objects that cn be seen 
the acceptable score for an image is 8 the fda said in 1985 
the average score was 78 and in 1988 the average had climbed to 
99 
the better quality in todays imaging devices is partly because 
of improvements in equipment including more use of xray machines 
that are specifically designed for mammography according to fred 
rueter of the fdas center for devices and radiological health one 
of the authors of the article 
he also said screen and film systems more sensitive to xrays 
are helping to produce clearer pictures 
fda officials said that even a substandard image may still 
detect cancer earlier than if a woman relies only on breast 
selfexamination alone 
but some members of congress are concerned that only one out of 
five mammography facilities meets the voluntary professional 
standards of the american college of radiology 
several members plan to introduce legislation next year that 
would set minimum federal safety standards for mammography 
services

the european community is drafting a 
multibillion dollar aid package for the soviet union including 
food officials said tuesday 
leaders of the 12 ec states are to approve the aid when they 
meet in rome dec 1415 the ec executive commission is readying 
the package in consultation with other nations the international 
monetary fund and the world bank 
commission president jacques delors outlined the measures to ec 
foreign ministers at a meeting in brussels 
the package carries no firm price tag but figures are being 
mentioned of between 136 billion and 272 billion over two 
years dutch foreign minister hans van den broek said 
he and other officials said that would mainly provide for food 
and transportation the ec also plans to provide technical and 
administrative aid 
german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher said we have 
to give a signal to support reforms in the soviet union 
in addition the ec is studying more longterm assistance for 
the ailing soviet economy notably by helping make the ruble a 
convertible currency and balance of payment support 
ec aid for these purposes has not yet been calculated 
officials said the community also planned to help the soviet 
union improve its oil production 
british foreign secretary douglas hurd said the problem at the 
heart of food shortages in the soviet union was a very poor 
distribution system 
germany in gratitude for moscows support of german 
unification began a largescale program last week to ship food 
from private citizens and public storage to the soviet union 
the soviet aid package has been kept separate from ec aid plans 
for other countries because of the scope of soviet economic 
financial and food needs

a questionable projection for an 
earthquake remained in effect tuesday but parties along the new 
madrid fault were over and tv crews left residents to their usually 
quiet lives 
the small towns along the fault which runs from marked tree 
ark northeast through missouri to cairo ill began getting back 
to normal 
were not used to traffic jams said virginia carlson 
director of the new madrid historical museum but i think 
everybody was amused by it 
about 40 television satellite trucks rumbled out of this small 
mississippi river town in southeast missouri on tuesday after the 
bullseye day of the projection had passed 
today you couldnt tell that thered ever been any talk of an 
earthquake said mayor joe gude of blytheville ark 
iben browning a business consultant from tijares nm said 
that there was a 5050 chance for a major quake in the midwest or 
several other locations between dec 1 and dec 5 
he based his projection on unusually high tidal forces which he 
claims trigger earthquakes earthquake experts around the country 
said brownings projection was nothing more than a random guess and 
tidal forces had nothing to do with earthquakes 
browning was vacationing at an undisclosed location said his 
daughter evelynn garriss 
mrs garriss noted there was a big quake in the soviet union 
within the same 30 to 60degree north latitudes that we were 
concerned about but mrs garriss would not say whether that 
fulfilled her fathers projection 
in any case she noted that her father said the quake could 
happen any time from 48 hours before monday to 48 hours afterward 
scientists have also noted that major earthquakes occur 
somewhere in the world every three days so its easy to make 
general predictions and be correct 
in new madrid tshirts were still available and business owners 
were talking about sponsoring an iben browning day next year 
angie holtzhouser a spokeswoman for the chamber of commerce 
said she didnt think there would be much of a legacy from 
brownings projection for the town 
such a megadose of roundtheclock media i think has created 
some unnecessary fear and i hope that fades quickly she said 
she shrugged off fears that new industries would shun new madrid 
because of all the earthquake attention 
has it harmed california she asked 
jack hailey owner of haps bar was cleaning up tuesday from 
his nearly 20hour shake rattle and roll bash that began at 6 
am monday he said he may make the party an annual event but 
next year will plan his tshirt order better he sold all of the 84 
he had on hand 
if id known what was going to happen i would have had 500 
more hailey said 
in nearby malden on tuesday city officials were still in the 
midst of a 10day disaster drill that sent them out of city hall 
and into an emergency center and theyve already learned plenty 
its the little things you forget said city clerk rhonda 
hollingshad one of the things we decided we really need is a 
sign to let people know where we are 
the drill which has brought city business to a near standstill 
will end friday not a moment too soon for hollingshad 
im going to go in monday and work for a solid week without 
going home because of everything thats piling up she said 
meanwhile officials began adding up the costs and benefits of 
the browning projection 
mississippi emergency management agency director je maher said 
his agency spent at least 31000 in recent months 
in travel in putting together materials for presentations 
its taken a pretty substantial slice of revenue from our budget 
he said 
in missouri state officials estimated the cost at between 
40000 and 60000 but they werent complaining 
we got more productivity from the dollars we spent than we did 
in probably three years worth of spending said rd ross the 
director of missouri emergency management office 
kentucky officials spent about 2800 to print up extra 
pamphlets but mike lynch earthquake program coordinator for the 
state said there were other costs for emergency officials 
can we put a dollar value on my nerves

prime minister jozsef antall warned 
tuesday of a year of privation for many hungarians as the 
government tries to stem growing poverty inflation and 
unemployment and introduce a free market economy 
next year will be a year of grave tribulations but there is a 
way out antall told a hushed parliament however that means 
we must not undermine our faith and determination but unite and 
work together as a nation 
the country is at a crossroads and the hour of awakening is 
at hand 
hungarys 21 billion foreign debt makes it the most heavily 
indebted east european country on a per capita basis next year 
24 billion of principal will have to be repaid along with 17 
billion in interest and the heavy load is expected to add to the 
strain of switching to a market economy 
inflation is at 35 percent unemployment officially unknown 
under the former communist leadership stands at 70000 and is 
expected to include 200000 of the 45 million work force by next 
year 
the state mti news agency on monday cited statistics indicating 
at least 60 percent of families are drawing on savings to make ends 
meet compared to 40 percent last year 
in october truckers and cabbies furious over a planned 65 
percent gasoline price increase blocked main streets and highways 
throughout hungary for three days most of the population supported 
the protest forcing the government to back down and agree to 
smaller price increases 
in his televised speech tuesday antall warned of anarchy 
and social unrest that could follow the predicted worsening of the 
economy 
if we cannot solve the economic tasks cannot avoid the 
decline there will be social tensions and conflicts which will 
pose a threat to our fledgling democracy he told legislators 
antall outlined dismaying statistics 
industrial productivity here is onethird that of developed 
countries energy consumption is two to three times as high 
the forecast rise in oil prices and agricultural losses due to 
the summer drought will cost hungarians 2 billion 
he blamed past communist mismanagement for some of hungarys 
present problems saying 416 billion will be needed for economic 
development and 167 billion for environmental protection 
this is what we have inherited and we must accept it no one 
will shoulder it for us antall said 
the huge debt is due to largescale borrowng the past 20 years 
with hungary offering citizens western imports and other amenities 
not found elsewhere in east europe he said 
antall said dissatisfaction and discontent were justified but 
parties opposed to his conservative government coalition have been 
unable to offer better solutions 
the prime minister asked for cooperation by all sides in 
parliament prior to his governments presentation next week of a 
budget with a planned deficit of 13 billion

two white men were acquitted of murder tuesday 
in the raciallymotivated slaying of a black teenager in a mob 
attack in the citys bensonhurst section last year 
the jury took just four hours to return the verdicts for james 
patino and joseph serrano following a twoweek trial the two 
smiled broadly as the verdicts were read hugged their lawyer and 
then embraced in state supreme court in brooklyn 
also tuesday another jury heard closing arguments in the case 
of bensonhurst defendant john vento who is being retried for 
murder manslaughter and riot after his first trial ended with a 
hung jury jurors were sequestered tuesday evening and were 
expected to begin deliberations wednesday 
the verdict makes patino the first defendant in the case to be 
cleared of all charges 
i feel great and my lawyers wonderful said patino 25 
outside the courthouse im glad everythings over 
im sorry for what happened to yusuf hawkins but i had 
nothing to with it said serrano 21 after the verdict i was 
confident i was secure in my innocence 
both defendants had been accused of murder manslaughter riot 
discrimination and other charges in the attack that resulted in the 
death of hawkins who was shot in the mostly white brooklyn 
neighborhood on aug 23 1989 
patino was found innocent of all the crimes serrano was 
convicted only of a misdemeanor weapons possession charge that is 
punishable by up to a year in prison 
prosecutor edward boyar shrugged and told reporters i never 
quibble with a jurys verdict 
hawkins killing was the most serious racial incident in the 
city since the 1986 killing of a 23yearold black man in howard 
beach in that confrontation the victim was struck and killed by a 
car after a mob of whites chased him onto a highway 
hawkins 16 was slain when he and three friends all black 
teenagers went to bensonhurst to look at a used car the unarmed 
youths attracted the attention of a mob of as many as 30 
batwielding whites looking for a fight 
in ventos case assistant district attorney paul burns said 
vento was an active recruiter and one of the leaders of the 
mob 
joseph fama acting by himself could never have committed 
this crime burns said referring to the convicted murderer of 
hawkins 
but defense lawyer gerald j dichiara said fama acted alone in 
the shooting and said vento had nothing to do with it 
either he aided joe fama in the murder or hes not guilty 
dichiara said jurors were to begin deliberating his fate later 
tuesday 
fama was convicted of pulling a pistol and firing several shots 
through hawkins chest the mob scattered without pausing to aid 
their victim or telephone the police 
prosecutors did not charge serrano and patino with shooting 
hawkins but alleged they acted in concert with fama and shared the 
responsibility for the slaying 
after hearing the prosecutions case state judge thaddeus owens 
said their evidence was insufficient to uphold many of the charges 
he told the lawyers he would set aside the verdicts if serrano or 
patino were convicted of murder or manslaughter 
in allowing the jury to deliberate the charges and deliver a 
finding owens preserved the prosecutors right to appeal any 
verdict he dismissed 
but owens tossed out several charges before the case went to the 
jury citing a lack of evidence those counts included one of two 
murder charges against serrano a gun possession charge against 
patino and assault for both men 
the main prosecution witnesses were gina feliciano and her 
mother phyllis dagata the two women said they watched from their 
secondfloor window as the mob pursued the blacks around a corner 
where the shooting took place 
but they were unable to place serrano or patino at the scene and 
their testimony was filled with inconsistencies and contradictions 
fama is serving 32 and twothirds years to life for his 
conviction keith mondello the ringleader was acquitted of murder 
and manslaughter but convicted of several lesser crimes he was 
sentenced to five and onethird years to 16 years 
several other defendants are scheduled to stand trial early next 
year including charles stressler whose first case ended in a 
mistrial

president hussain muhammad ershad 
capitulated to a 7weekold campaign for his ouster tuesday 
promising to resign as soon as the opposition chooses a 
replacement 
staterun radio announced the move in a latenight news 
bulletin soon afterward hundreds of people thronged the streets 
defying a curfew that restricted civilians to their homes 
many danced set off fire crackers in celebration and shouted 
slogans 
where is ershad now some chanted seize the airport so he 
cannot flee catch ershad kill his ministers 
at least 1000 people attacked a downtown office of ershads 
jatiya party reporters at the scene said portraits of ershad and 
office furniture were thrown into the street and set on fire they 
said 
security forces did not intervene or attempt to get people to 
return to their homes but troops were seen being deployed outside 
the homes of government ministers to prevent further attacks 
the radio bulletin said a special session of parliament was 
scheduled for sunday to ratify the choice of ershads replacement 
sheik hasina one of two opposition leaders heading the 
antiershad campaign called his resignation a peoples 
victory 
we are watching everything until the final game is over she 
said adding that choosing a replacement for ershad was not a 
problem 
the campaign for ershads ouster had mushroomed in recent weeks 
doctors university professors some of ershads parliamentarians 
and civil servants have resigned in solidarity with the opposition 
last week ershad imposed a state of emergency and suspended all 
civil rights in an attempt to crush the movement 
the army had been called out to prevent street protests against 
his rule and the opposition claimed that at least 100 political 
activists had been shot and killed the government said only six 
people had died 
despite the crackdown the protests continued on monday ershad 
offered to resign 45 days before junes presidential vote he also 
offered to dissolve the legislature and hold simultaneous elections 
for the presidency and parliament 
the opposition said his concessions were not sufficient and 
urged daily dawntodusk strikes to force the presidents immediate 
resignation 
ms hasina and the second opposition leader khaleda zia have 
opposed ershad since the former army general took power in a 1982 
coup but political differences between the two hindered earlier 
efforts to depose him 
the latest campaign was launched in october after the two said 
they had resolved their differences 
ms hasina is the daughter of sheik mujibur rahman bangladeshs 
first president mrs zia is the widow of ziaur rehman another 
former president both men were assassinated 
on monday the president said in a nationally televised speech 
that the emergency restrictions would be lifted on dec 16 the 
19th anniversary of bangladeshs independence from pakistan he 
also announced the immediate lifting of press censorship which had 
been imposed along with the emergency 
but on tuesday at least 19 lawmakers from ershads jatiya party 
resigned from parliament according to a letter circulated by 
speaker shamsul huda chowdhury 
the party holds 266 of 300 seats giasuddin ahmed one lawmaker 
who resigned later said the parliament has now become isolated 
from the people 
despite a ban on political meetings leaders of the three major 
opposition alliances addressed rallies in dhaka and announced daily 
protest strikes 
cars stayed off the streets and shops were closed in the 
capital and in the southern port city of chittagong 
banks and most businesses were shut government offices opened 
in dhaka but with most transportation off the roads few employees 
showed up for work 
if ershads replacement is chosen by the opposition and approved 
by parliament it will be the first peaceful transition of power in 
bangladesh the country has had nine presidents since it gained 
independence in 1971 and all have taken over after assassinations 
or military coups ershad has ruled about half that time 
bangladesh one of the poorest nations in the world has more 
than 107 million people it is bordered by india burma and the bay 
of bengal 
analysts said ershad stayed in power so long by balancing 
civilian bureaucrats against army generals and frequently shuffling 
the military command to block the emergence of any rival power 
centers within the establishment 
but as the protests dragged on observers said his support in 
the army appreared less solid than earlier believed 
though ershad gave bangladesh a measure of political stability 
after a quick succession of militaryinstalled presidents he made 
little headway in alleviating the misery of his people 
ershad was opposed to iraqs invasion of kuwait and sent a token 
force to stand alongside the united states and its allies

once again an ethnic miami neighborhood erupted 
pentup frustrations sparked by a single incident this time 
though it was in a community seldom heard from 
this is singular for the puerto rican community but not 
singular for miami said puerto ricanborn maurice ferre who was 
mayor for 12 years 
it seems to be a pattern now for behavior in the poor 
disadvantaged neighborhoods of miami black haitian puerto 
rican he said 
ferre referred to a rampage monday night in the citys largely 
puerto rican community of wynwood after the acquittal of six police 
officers accused of fatally beating puerto rican drug dealer 
leonardo mercado 
as with members of other ethnic groups after earlier 
disturbances some puerto ricans on tuesday talked of neglect by 
miamis dominant cubanamerican population 
puerto rican flags were waved during the disturbance and there 
were shouts of viva puerto rico from members of an ethnic 
group thats had a low miami profile 
we want the people to know that we exist weve got puerto 
ricans in this city too said clemente montalvo who said hes 
lived all his life in wynwood its not just because of the 
mercado trial cubans get everything we get nothing when the 
cubans jump they get what they want 
ferre and other community leaders said the reasons behind the 
outbreak were complex they said many of the looters were youthful 
opportunists and many werent puerto rican or from wynwood 
ferre was mayor in 1980 during miamis worst riots which 
followed the acquittal of white police officers in the beating 
death of black insurance salesman arthur mcduffie the rioting 
claimed 18 lives and caused more than 100 million in damage 
black rioting broke out three other times in the 1980s most 
recently the january 1989 riots following the deaths of two blacks 
after a police shooting 
last july miami riot police moved in after four days of violent 
haitian protests at a shop owned by a cubanamerican accused of 
mistreating a haitian in his store 
the rioting monday stunned police city officials and many in 
the wynwood community where mercado had once lived 
ferre said such disturbances are waiting to happen in urban 
areas where people feel helpless economically and politically 
somebody pushes somebody in a store theres a perception of 
an injustice its an explosion said ferre who comes from one 
of puerto ricos most influential political families and led miami 
until 1985 when he was ousted by the citys first cubanborn 
mayor xavier suarez 
wynwood was one of the first large hispanic neighborhoods in 
florida in the postworld war ii era populated mainly by puerto 
rican migrant workers there are now an estimated 55000 puerto 
ricans in the miami metropolitan area compared with more than 
600000 cubans and more than 100000 people each in the nicaraguan 
and haitian communities 
wynwood has become more diverse in recent years though the 
puerto rican influence is obvious with roberto clemente park named 
for the late puerto ricanborn baseball star and several stores 
with the name borinquen the island term for puerto ricans 
drugs and poverty have increased longtime residents said 
its changed quite a lot to the negative side said david 
bonilla who lived there from 1955 and is the puerto ricanborn 
miami city police chaplain 
bonilla said the outbreak involved many outsiders and wasnt a 
true reflection of wynwood but he said some puerto ricans were 
using the attention to seek help for their deteriorating community 
some of these people want to let somebody know that we need 
help in the community bonilla said they say hey while the 
cameras are here everybodys here

former east german communist chief erich honecker 
should stand trial on charges he signed shoottokill orders for 
guards at the berlin wall a roman catholic bishop from east berlin 
said tuesday 
the law is the law on humanitarian grounds this individual 
humn being should not be treated differently than any other 
bishop georg sterzinsky of berlinbrandenburg told a news 
conference 
the berlin justice office issued an arrest warrant friday 
charging honecker with manslaughter the charges directly link him 
to several deaths 
if convicted his prison sentence could range from five years to 
life 
about 200 people died trying to escape east germany during the 
28year existence of the berlin wall 
bishop sterzinsky who is based in former east berlin said that 
it would be possible to think about sparing honecker from prison 
after sentencing he spoke to reporters following a meeting of 
berlin bishops 
honecker remained tuesday inside a soviet hospital 20 miles 
south of berlin 
justice officials in bonn denied talks had taken place with 
soviet officials about serving an arrest warrant against honecker 
german police must have permission from the soviets to enter the 
hospital 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vitaly churkin said in moscow 
on monday that honecker was staying at the hospital for 
humanitarian reasons 
honeckers lawyers have lodged a protest against the arrest 
warrant but the berlin justice office said tuesday it could take 
days to make a decision the defense counsels maintain honecker 
78 is too ill to stand trial

a jewish museum in central israel seems 
an unlikely place in which to hear about the warm and human side of 
saddam hussein 
most israelis know him as the arab dictator whose threats have 
forced them to get gas masks but vicky a jewish immigrant from 
iraq remembers him as the man who comforted her when she came to 
him for help in getting her husband out of prison 
another woman recalled being protected from antijewish riots by 
saddams family in his home village of takrit 
the two women spoke at the babylonian jewry heritage center in 
or yehuda an immigrant town outside tel aviv at a discussion 
sunday titled saddam husseins mindset on jews israelis and 
zionists 
vicky did not want her surname published because she said she 
still has relatives in iraq she told her story in hebrew laced 
with iraqi idioms sitting next to her husband she believes he was 
saved from the gallows with saddams help 
in 1968 a coup had installed saddam as iraqs no 2 man behind 
ahmad hasan albakr the previous regime had jailed many jews 
including vickys husband and his brother as alleged spies she 
and her sisterinlaw naima were desperate 
one day she recalled an acquaintance gave her the address of a 
man named saddam hussein i said who is this saddam isnt he 
against the jews 
the acquaintance reassured her hes not against anybody 
next day she and naima went to the address next to the yarmuk 
mosque in baghdad they asked a passerby where they could find 
saddam hussein i am saddam hussein he replied 
she hadnt expected a man wearing a simple arab robe and living 
in a relatively humble house 
i got a fright of course i started crying and fell around 
his shoulders he said sister whats the matter he invited 
the women into his house and his wife sajida served coffee 
how do you know your husband is innocent saddam asked 
i know a wife has to know everything vicky recalled 
answering 
saddam retorted when i made the revolution my wife knew 
nothing about it he promised to look into the case and told 
vicky to visit whenever she liked 
she came to the house eight times hoping for news she became 
friendly with sajida and saddams mother saddam had also spent 
time in prison and sajida told vicky i know what youre going 
through i tasted it too 
the last time she saw saddam he had changed he wore a western 
suit and tanks guarded the house by yarmuk mosque he told her 
there was testimony implicating her husband and that he would be 
interrogated further 
i knew he was being tortured i said what piece of his body 
will be left to interrogate i was very cheeky he said thats 
the way it is we will investigate and every spy we find will be 
hanged 
he spoke sternly wagging a finger and told her not to come 
again 
in january 1969 when the iraqis hanged 13 jews vickys husband 
and his brother were sentenced to three years in prison vicky is 
convinced the relatively light sentence was influenced by saddam 
having taken a personal interest i believe saddam helped she 
said 
after they were released the family immigrated to israel 
how does she feel when she hears president bush likening saddam 
to hitler she groped for words i dont know she said to 
me he was good 
raya who also asked that her surname not be published grew up 
in saddams village of takrit and remembers her parents friendship 
with his family 
she said her father a wealthy businessman who brought 
electrical power to takrit lent his car to drive saddams mother 
to baghdad to give birth to an older brother of saddam 
in 1941 when antijewish riots erupted in iraq she and her 
family hid under their beds until the villagers including saddams 
relatives came to them to promise them protection 
while fiercely hostile to zionism saddam treats iraqs tiny 
150member jewish community benevolently said mordechai benporat 
an iraqborn former cabinet minister who sat next to vicky and 
naima while they talked 
he said saddams attitude to jews was shaped in part by the 
kindness of takrits jews to his mother it didnt totally 
influence him benporat said but it definitely had an 
influence 
saddam has said the israelipalestinian dispute should be 
negotiated along with iraqs withdrawal from kuwait 
he had threatened to use chemical weapons against israel even 
before his august invasion of kuwait the israeli government in 
october began distributing gas masks to its citizens

unlike his predecessor northwest airlines 
chairman al checchi went before cameras after the airlines first 
plane disaster since he took over last year 
in detroit tuesday checchi visited with seven of the injured 
from mondays runway collision between two northwest planes and 
gave an emotional speech in which he mourned the eight people who 
died in the accident 
by contrast former northwest chairman steven rothmeier let 
company spokespeople do all the talking when flight 255 went down 
on aug 16 1987 near the same detroit airport killing 156 
people 
checchi who was in los angeles when the accident occurred went 
to detroit with a team of company officials after announcing that 
the airline would pay travel and lodging costs for passengers of 
the two planes and their families 
checchi announced tuesday that northwest would pay all medical 
expenses and other expenses incurred by passengers and their 
families the chief executive spoke in a choking voice near the end 
of his statement when he said that a northwest flight attendant 
died in the crash 
as most of you know flight attendant heidi joost lost her 
life in the line of duty checchi said and flight attendant 
mary kay ruanebolin was severely injured but managed to pull 
several peope to safety from the aircraft 
we just feel its important for him to be there in detroit 
and hes made the commitment to be there said doug miller a 
northwest spokesman 
it was the first plane disaster at northwest since checchi led a 
365 billion buyout of the nations fourthlargest airline in 
august 1989 
redmond tyler a former northwest spokesman who advised 
rothmeier during the 1987 crash said it was a mistake not to have 
the chief executive appear on television to explain the companys 
actions 
in retrospect i would have had him on there tyler said in a 
telephone interview from his home in atlanta 
tyler now a crisis management consultant said there was a 
perception that rothmeier was aloof or cold or cool but 
rothmeier cared deeply about the victims and their families and did 
everything he could to help them tyler said 
contributing to rothmeiers stony image was northwests refusal 
to release the list of passengers on the 1987 flight tyler said he 
made the decision not to release the list and rothmeier supported 
him despite heavy media criticism 
in keeping with that policy alan muncaster vice president of 
corporate communications at northwest said monday that northwest 
would not release the passenger list from either plane involved in 
the runway collision 
you infuriate the media but really what you get is protection 
for the families tyler said the families thanked us for 
that

a halfcentury after a collection of 
spanish civil war photographs belonging to the late robert capa 
disappeared the foreign ministry on tuesday made public a 
catalogue of the original prints 
capas brother cornell capa who was instrumental in 
identifying the 97 prints looked on 
cornell capa now 72 and chief of the new yorkbased 
international center of photography catalogued the prints as works 
of his older brother or of david seymour cofounder with robert 
capa of the magnum photo agency or of capas companion gerda 
taro 
the younger capa himself a photographer who did the lab work 
for much of robert capas spanish photos said the 54yearold 
prints were in excellent condition 
he said the negatives had disappeared somewhere along the 
line probably in the next war world war ii 
robert capa born endre erno friedmann in pest hungary in 
1913 began his storied career as a war photographer in the 193639 
spanish conflict 
he covered the allied landings in north africa and normandy the 
liberation of paris the war in china and the birth of israel he 
died in 1954 after stepping on an antipersonnel mine in indochina 
capa changed his name in 1936 and became a us citizen in 
1946 
his photographs of spanish loyalist soldiers and militiamen 
fighting rebellious troops led by gen francisco franco and of 
refugees fleeing aerial bombardments brought the fratricidal 
conflict into the consciousness of a world edging slowing toward 
world war ii 
included in the collection is a highquality print of capas 
falling soldier taken at the cordoba front in early september 
1936 
the stark photo of the loyalist soldier falling backward after 
being shot his rifle in his right hand became perhaps the 
bestknown image of the spanish war 
until the late 1970s most spaniards were not familiar with 
capas photos of their war the pictures were published abroad and 
because they highlighted the republican side copies or collections 
of the photos were not readily available in postwar spain 
the prints showed up at the foreign ministry in madrid in march 
1979 in a small suitcase accompanied by a letter from swedish 
ambassador lennart petri 
petri explained that the unidentified collection was delivered 
to the swedish legation in vichy france during the war under 
mysterious circumstances and was later shipped to the foreign 
ministry in stockholm for safekeeping until spain returned to 
democracy 
franco ruled spain from 1939 until he died in 1975 spain 
returned to full democracy four years later 
archivists determined that capa gave the collection to juan 
negrin then prime minister who went into exile in france in 1939 
and died there in 1956 
it wasnt until 1987 however that serious efforts were made to 
identify the photographs at least five of which had never been 
published 
foreign ministry archivist mercedes perez vera said the photos 
would become the property of the spanish state 
the question remains whether the collection will join the civil 
war archives in salamanca available only to researchers or 
become part of a museum collection open to the public 
cornell capa obtained a set of copy negatives and prints for his 
brothers estate 
the edition of the catalogue was limited to 1000 copies

the bloodiest of four army 
uprisings in four years was also the shortest and president 
menems decisive management of the crisis may strengthen his 
government 
mondays uprising two days before president bushs scheduled 
visit was quickly crushed menem said tuesday the rebel leaders 
will be tried by military court and face the death penalty if found 
guilty 
late monday after the rebels had filed out of the last of the 
buildings they had seized before dawn menem told a news conference 
that my pulse isnt going to tremble if military officers who 
had rebelled repeatedly and killed people in the proces forfeit 
their lives 
the unofficial death toll in the uprising rose tuesday to 14 
when a soldier died from wounds suffered in putting down the 
insurrection 
unofficial tallies put the number of wounded at nearly 60 and 
the arrested at more than 400 
the government did not disclose its figures on casualties and 
arrests 
menem and defense minister humberto romero signed a decree that 
legally separated the rebel leaders from their followers 
while the leaders could face the death penalty the followers 
face charges in civil court where the worst punishment is life in 
prison 
menem is convinced the death penalty should be applied to end 
these happenings said raul granillo ocampo the presidents 
legal adviser 
that attitude found support in this capital city of 10 million 
whose residents saw their democracy threatened by the uprising 
in quelling it air force planes bombed tanks on public roads 
and a bridge was dynamited rebels fired at and hit vice president 
eduardo duhaldes helicopter 
on tuesday rebels who hid overnight at a rural buenos aires 
province farm gave themselves up along with three tanks they had 
seized 
argentinas two biggest political groups the governing 
perronist party and the civic radical union issued a statement 
with 23 other parties saying the government should punish the 
rebels with severity 
the rebels had demanded a shakeup of the military high command 
and a bigger military budget observers said they also sought to 
embarrass menem by forcing bush to cancel a visit to argentina on 
wednesday 
bush was in uruguay on tuesday 
menem refused to concede a single point and even while rebels 
still held the army headquarters bush said he would arrive on 
schedule 
menem was sworn in 17 months ago amid hyperinflation recession 
food riots and military unrest he seemed to have strengthened his 
government by choosing to fight the rebels instead of negotiating 
as former president raul alfonsin did on three occasions 
it did not escape argentines notice that under menem the air 
force and navy for the first time helped put down an army 
rebellion 
so no one would doubt that rebels surrendered unconditionally 
they were ordered to walk out with their hands behind their necks 
and shoeless a gesture meant to humiliate them 
the rebels thought the president would be frightened and give 
in to their pressures and become their puppet said adelina 
dalesio de viola a national deputy with the opposition union of 
the democratic center 
but at every moment menem showed himself to be very firm 
she said 
granillo ocampo menems aide said the jailed leader of a 
december 1988 revolt retired col mohamed ali seineldin admitted 
he played a role in the rebellion 
he said seineldin asked for a pistol with one bullet 
presumably to kill himself but authorities refused 
several other current and former officers under arrest sided 
with seineldin or cashiered lt col aldo rico during the april 
1987 and january 1988 military uprisings 
late tuesday menem canceled the stateofsiege decree 
menems brother eduardo menem who is president of the senate 
claimed tuesday night the rebels intended to assassinate key 
political figures 
the list included the president at least one cabinet minister 
and the leader of the ruling peronist party bloc in congress 
eduardo menem told the independent news agency noticias argentina 
he cited state intelligence agency information but offered no 
proof to support his claim

iraq may be ready to withdraw from most of kuwait 
as long as it is allowed to keep the disputed rumailah oil field 
according to a british news report tuesday 
british and us officials said they have heard nothing of such 
a proposal 
sky television news said iraqi president saddam hussein has been 
spelling out his negotiating position on the persian gulf dispute 
in private meetings with senior mediators including soviet envoy 
yevgeny primakov a top adviser on foreign affairs to mikhail s 
gorbachev 
te report pushed spot oil prices sharply lower and propelled 
the dow jones average in new york from a 25point loss a halfhour 
before closing to a 14point gain to 257970 points at the end of 
tuesdays trading 
in washington however a senior us official said on condition 
of anonymity we know absolutely nothing about this it comes 
as no surprise to us that these types of rumors will be surfacing 
more and more 
britains foreign office also said it knew of no such 
negotiations but added theres got to be a full and 
unconditional withdrawal from kuwait restoration of the legitimate 
government and a release of hostages 
the skytv report said a source close to one of the negotiations 
outlined to its reporter the sort of deal saddam had in mind in 
exchange for a guarantee against any western attack on iraq he 
would pull out of kuwait except for the oil field on the border 
while much of the rumailah oil field is in southern iraq it 
also crosses about two miles into kuwait 
skytv a 24hour news channel is part of the sky television 
satellite system launched by media mogul rupert murdoch in february 
1989 
a multinational force of more than 400000 led by the united 
states is in the gulf to oppose iraq following the passage of a 
un resolution last week saddam has been given until jan 15 to 
withdraw or face possible attack 
saddam also would give back the strategically important islands 
of bubiyan and warba as long as kuwait would discuss leasing them 
and he would accept the return of the kuwaiti royal family which 
fled when iraq invaded aug 2 according to the report 
the report said the western allies already heard of this iraqi 
position and their ambassadors discussed it after the un meeting 
last week 
sky quoted unidentified us sources as saying western 
acceptance of the loss of the oil field one of the largest in the 
region would hinge on whether the kuwaitis were prepared to give 
it up 
it also said a delegation of senior kuwaiti officials in the 
netherlands said all aspects of the dispute are negotiable once the 
iraqis have withdrawn which the television report saw as an 
indication the kuwaitis might take the offer seriously 
the delegation is in amsterdam to urge support for armed action 
against iraq

a resolution calling on iran to end human 
rights abuses was adopted by a general assembly committee tuesday 
just as amnesty international accused tehran of a wave of 
executions 
the strongest wording in the draft resolution was dropped monday 
so iran would continue cooperating with un human rights 
investigations and let the red cross visit its prisons 
draft language criticizing executions illtreatment and 
torture in iran was deleted by the assembly subcommittee dealing 
with human rights the adopted draft expresses concern over 
allegations of violations of human rights in a un report 
iran joined in the consensus tuesday to recommend sending the 
resolution to the full general assembly where it will be adopted 
later this month 
at the same hour the resolution was adopted londonbased 
amnesty said iran has executed more than 5000 people in the past 
three years many people were killed for their political beliefs 
the organization said 
amnesty officials said it was coincidence that the release of 
the report came on the same day as the resolution vote 
isobelle jaques amnesty internationals delegate to the united 
nations criticized the compromise wording of the resolution 
i feel that the resolution ought to address the actual human 
rights situation in iran she said i dont think that the 
resolution which was adopted today really reflects that 
but a european diplomat involved in the compromise defended it 
saying it contains the substance of the original resolution in 
return for securing irans cooperation the diplomat spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
its not ideal but its significant added saleh rajavi a 
un representative for the peoples mujahedeen of iran an exile 
group seeking to topple irans moslem fundamentalist government 
whats important is that the continuation of the monitoring of 
rights abuses in iran is still stipulated as a mandate of the un 
body rajavi said 
it was a failure for the iranian regime he said they 
admitted in that resolution to their own crimes 
amnesty internationals report said iranian dissidents are 
arrested and tortured some for only signing a letter criticizing a 
lack of human rights and freedoms 
the organization quoted former prisoners as saying a death 
commission of iranian officials chose prisoners daily for 
execution if their views were not acceptable 
in 1988 more than 2500 political prisoners were killed 
secretly in a few months on orders of the commission amnesty 
international said 
thousands more have been executed after summary trials in which 
they were convicted of criminal offenses it said crackdowns on 
drug trafficking led to more than 1100 executions in 1989 it 
said 
the un report used as the basis for the resolution was 
prepared by reynaldo galindo pohl of el salvador who has done 
critical un reports on irans human rights abuses since 1984 he 
was only allowed to visit the country in the last year 
tehran invited galindo because his previous reports were based 
heavily on testimony from exiles and emigres who resent irans 
theocracy 
galindos latest un report was not as harsh as many human 
righs advocates might have hoped but it severely criticized the 
climate of fear he found in iran and noted many executions and 
abuses of due process 
the original resolution would have had the general assembly 
express its concern about the numerous allegations of violations 
of human rights contained in the report notably those 
concerning executions illtreatment and torture 
the draft now calls on iran to investigate and rectify the 
human rights issues raised by the special representative in 
particular as regards administration of justice and due process of 
law 
responding to the amnesty report irans official news agency 
irna said galindo reported that many of the people listed by 
amnesty international as having been executed are actually still 
alive the news agency said galindo spoke with four of them in a 
tehran prison 
irna said the names were on a list given to amnesty 
international by the mujahedeen khalq opposition group 
amnesty said it would have no comment until it reviewed the irna 
statement

the curious crowded windows at an airport 
terminal tuesday for a look at the scorched dc9 jetliner where 
eight people died in a runway collision 
as i look at that plane just thinking how miraculous it was 
that anyone got out of there alive said ken blake a detroit 
resident waiting for a friend to arrive 
a squat tuglike tractor pulled the charred hulk of the 
northwest dc9 to a hangar then dragged the northwest boeing 727 
to another hangar the dc9 turned into the path of the 727 on 
monday at detroit metropolitan airport in a heavy fog 
the eight dead apparently died from noxious fumes before a flash 
fire on the dc9 burned them beyond recognition authorities said 
a total of 188 people on the two jets survived 
runway 3c was closed tuesday while the airport bustled with 
normal activity christmas music played softly throughout the 
airport 
its so gruesome and then you sit and listen to this 
christmas music said ronnie vest of canton township mich im 
not crazy about flying anyway and this only makes it worse 
dennis betz of toledo stood in the concourse awaiting a flight 
to kansas city eyes fixed on the dc9 wreckage i was thinking 
about driving back to kansas city but its still the safest way to 
travel he said 
barb wolf of phoenix was back in the concourse for the second 
straight day her flight to phoenix was canceled a day earlier she 
was in a perfect place to see mondays accident if anyone could 
have 
the fog was so thick she couldnt see more than 50 feet out the 
window 
it had to be right in front of us she said the first 
thing we knew something was wrong was when we saw fire trucks and 
ambulances heading out that way and then the fog cleared and there 
it was 
it horrifies me to look at that plane there and to know people 
died on it ms wolf said

trying a bit of bill wringing on nearly broke city hall 
city contracts for diminutive copies of the cracked bell the

bills on time as the citys fiscal crunch has worsened over the 
past three months leaving liebman out 2182814 he says hes 
owed 
because the city wont pay liebman says hes had to lay off 
workers and delay payments to his own creditors

upset but i cant be angry the city has been good to me for 30

cabinet ministers said tuesday that israel may 
deport palestinian activists as one way to stem a wave of arab 
stabbing attacks 
israel has expelled 60 palestinians during their 3yearold 
revolt but eased up on deportations in recent months following 
repeated western protests that such action was inhumane 
rightwing leaders want deportations back again following 
sundays fatal bus stabbing of an israeli near tel aviv the 12th 
such attack on jews in six weeks 
justice minister dan meridor said on israel television not 
only is there no deterrent to expulsions but we must acknowledge 
there is no choice but to use the weapon of deportation as well 
against inciters of violence 
meridor of prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc added the developments of the last few weeks show a need 
for new thinking intensive action if we prove our forbearance 
our ability to stand up we will win 
israeli news media said defense minister moshe arens was 
exploring ways of expediting deporation procedures since 
expulsions are often delayed by appeals to the supreme court 
arens spokesman danny naveh said in an interview that the idea 
of deporting arabs linked to attacks on israelis is always on the 
agenda he noted that arens considered deportations an 
effective means against violence but declined to elaborate 
in beit fajar a west bank village near bethlehem soldiers 
ambushed activists monday night at a common site for stonethrowing 
attacks shooting and wounding one protester in the leg the army 
said 
arab and israeli reports said a second youth anwar ahmad 
taqatqa 17 was wounded and later died of injuries 
the army said it could not confirm taqatqa died as a result of 
gunfire because the body was buried without autopsy 
he was the 776th palestinian killed by israelis in the revolt 
against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
fiftythree israelis also have died

saddam hussein on tuesday backed away from his confrontation 
with the kremlin promising to release the 3300 soviets he was 
holding moscow had warned it would use military force against iraq 
if soviets there were harmed 
meanwhile according to a british news report late tuesday iraq 
may be ready to withdraw from most of kuwait as long as it is 
allowed to keep the disputed rumailah oil field that crosses two 
miles into kuwaiti territory 
the rumors fanned speculation the persian gulf crisis could be 
resolved without bloodshed 
british and us officials said they have heard nothing of such 
a proposal 
in new york a late burst of buying sparked by the sky 
television report lifted the stock market from a 25point decline a 
halfhour before closing to a gain of 1411 points to 257970 
the report also pushed crude oil prices below 30 a barrel on 
the spot market analysts said the report came after the close of 
the new york mercantile exchange where crude closed up 151 to 
3066 
sky tv said saddam has been detailing his negotiating position 
on the gulf dispute in private meetings with mediators that include 
soviet envoy yevgeny primakov a top foreign adviser to mikhail s 
gorbachev 
in washington late tuesday a senior us official said the 
report was news to the bush administration and that they had heard 
nothing on any such negotiations 
in exchange for a guarantee against any western attack on iraq 
the report said iraqi forces would pull out of all of kuwait except 
for the oil field in southern iraq 
saddam also would give back the strategically important islands 
of bubiyan and warba as long as kuwait would discuss leasing them 
and he would accept the return of the kuwaiti royal family which 
fled when iraq invaded aug 2 according to the report 
before the gulf crisis began moscow was iraqs chief weapons 
supplier and main ally the kremlin has not sent troops to join the 
usled multinational force stationed in saudi arabia 
speaking in montevideo uruguay earlier tuesday on his second 
stop on a south american tour president bush said saddam has not 
gotten the message that he must get out of kuwait 
britains prime minister john major also talked tough on the 
gulf ruling out negotiations with iraq or any partial solutions 
or linkages to other issues 
the soviets mainly oil industry experts will be allowed to 
leave baghdad beginning wednesday the official iraqi news agency 
said it reported however that moscow would have to pay 
compensation for broken contracts 
iraq had warned foreign companies and employees it would demand 
compensation for any contract breached after its invasion 
in moscow presidential spokesman vitaly ignatenko said 3232 
soviets remained in iraq thousands more left in the months after 
the invasion 
moscow adopted a harder line against iraq last week when it 
accused saddam of breaking a promise to allow soviets to leave 
iraq is holding hundreds of westerners many at strategic sites 
to deter attack by the 340000strong usled multinational force 
deployed in the gulf soviets are not believed among those used as 
human shields 
saddam has said he would free all hostages between christmas and 
march 25 provided washington and its allies do not take military 
action that period is considered the optimum time for an offensive 
to drive the iraqis from kuwait 
the iraqi decision tuesday was seen as an attempt by saddam to 
forestall any soviet military intervention in the gulf that might 
cement the usled coalition already poised in the region against 
him 
but releasing the soviets is not likely to assuage moscows 
mounting impatience with saddam over his refusal to leave kuwait 
nor imperil its growing alliance with the west 
in washington congressional hearings continued on the bush 
administrations gulf policy 
senate democrats have repeatedly urged bush to stick with the 
economic embargo against iraq rather than rush into a war white 
house officials however have said the sanctions arent working 
ive not been one whose been convinced that sanctions alone 
will bring him to his senses bush said tuesday 
of saddam the president said i am convinced that up until 
now at least he has not gotten the message that he must 
withdraw from kuwait 
major addressed his first conservative party rally as prime 
minister and said he supported president bushs recent offer to 
send secretary of state james a baker iii to iraq but he said 
there should be no compromises 
there can be no question of negotiations concessions partial 
solutions or linkage to other issues he said 
earlier gen colin l powell chairman of the us joint chiefs 
of staff conferred with british defense secretary tom king and 
held his first meeting with major at the start of a twoday visit 
to london 
britain last month decided to send another 14000 troops to the 
gulf bringing its troop total to 30000 only the united states 
has committed more soldiers to the effort against iraq 
saddam has suggested a resolution to the gulf crisis should be 
linked to an israeli withdrawal from occupied arab lands the 
united states and its allies have said the palestinian issue is 
unrelated 
saddam met tuesday with jordans king hussein plo chairman 
yasser arafat and yemens vice president in advance of the 
usiraqi talks on the crisis a plo official said the three 
comprise saddams main support in the conflict 
also tuesday health minister abdulsalam mohammed saeed said 
1400 children under age 5 have died because of shortages of 
medicine vaccines and food brought on by the un trade embargo 
there was no way to independently verify the reports but a 
doctor at one baghdad hospital said on condition of anonymity there 
was no shortage of basic medicines or medical supplies in iraq 
western diplomats in baghdad said iraq received 30 tons of 
medical supplies between midoctober and midnovember alone in 
exchange for the release of western hostages another 40 tons of 
medical supplies reportedly were shipped to iraq in late november

bill trappen was miffed that his seat 
wouldnt recline on northwest airlines flight 1482 but when the 
plane collided with another jet at detroit metropolitan airport 
his seat assignment made him a hero 
because of a new federal aviation administration regulation the 
21yearold university of pittsburgh student was assigned a seat 
near an emergency exit through which he helped several passengers 
flee the burning dc9 
on oct 5 the faa began requiring airlines to assign exit row 
seats to passengers strong enough to open exit doors in the event 
of an emergency the passengers are asked before being given the 
seat if they are willing to help evacuate others if they say no 
they are assigned another seat 
in an emergency situation its just the sheer quickness of a 
person who is ablebodied and can get the exit door open in time to 
help others faa spokesman mort edelstein said tuesday from his 
chicago office 
at northwest gate agents are charged with recruiting passengers 
for emergency exit seats said spokesman kevin whalen 
trappen returning to pittsburgh after a weekend in florida 
said he had nodded off when the wingtip of a memphisbound 727 
jetliner speeding toward takeoff clipped the dc9 which had turned 
in front it on the fogshrouded runway 
the dc9s engine was ripped off and fuel started streaming from 
the jet which held 39 passengers and four crew members eight 
people died and 20 were injured 
with the aisle jammed with people trying to get off at the front 
of the plane trappen turned to the emergency exit by his seat in 
row 8 he and another passenger john izzo 41 of pittsburgh 
opened the door and began leading other passengers across the win 
to the runway 
until i turned around things didnt look so bad trappen 
said but when i looked behind me i could see people strapped in 
their seats who were already dead you could tell and there were 
screams 
trappen said he considered izzo the hero 
after leading four passengers to safety they saw a man on fire 
izzo threw him on the ground patted down the flames and got him 
to a paramedic trappen said 
trappen was treated for a cut over his right eye he said hed 
drive to school later in the week izzo who works for westinghouse 
nuclear services division near new stanton pa was on his way 
home from an assignment in michigan 
edelstein said disabled rights groups have criticized the faa 
rule as discriminatory 
maybe so but if i were handicapped i would prefer an aisle 
seat leaving the emergency exit seat to someone who can get it 
open more quickly he said this is a perfect example if it 
happened that way

the immigration and naturalization service 
said tuesday it had released 75 salvadorans from custody in 
anticipation of a new form of legal residence for them 
the 75 were those who may qualify for socalled temporary 
protected status under the new immigration law signed last week 
by president bush 
this provision was established for salvadorans illegally in this 
country who fear returning to their wartorn homeland but 
nonetheless do not qualify for regular refgee status 
to be admitted to legal residence as a refugee an immigrant 
must demonstrate a wellfounded fear of persecution at home 
the immigration and naturalization service in the past has 
contended that most salvadorans who enter the united states 
illegally could not qualify as refugees 
the new law permits those salvadorans in the united states 
before sept 19 and here continuously since then to apply for 
temporary protected status as of jan 2 permitting them to 
work legally and banning their deportation 
the law contains provision for eventual extension to citizens of 
other nations temporary protected status is to last only 18 
months from jan 1 
an ins statement quoted the head of the service gene mcnary as 
saying in keeping with the humanitarian spirit of the temporary 
protected status program the service was releasing salvadorans 
in custody who could qualify 
they must remain in the united states to remain eligible 
the statement said all salvadorans who are encountered by ins 
agents in enforcement actions while this program is in effect will 
be advised of the benefit and given the opportunity to show their 
eligibility 
verne jervis a spokesman for the service said the 75 were 
released from cities all over the country but a good number of 
them were in california 
jervis estimated that about 300 salvadorans were in custody 
those not released either had criminal charges pending against 
them or had entered the united states after sept 19 he said

one of germanys most influential states 
badenwuerttemberg suggested tuesday that soviet jews receive 
special status to bypass the countrys tough immigration laws 
the announcement by the southern state comes amid debate whether 
the number of foreigners seeking to come to germany should be 
limited 
there has been a great deal of pressure to let in more soviet 
jews for humanitarian reasons 
germanys jewish population was virtually wiped out during adolf 
hitlers third reich in 1933 there were 530000 jews living in 
germany today there are fewer than 40000 six million jews were 
killed during the nazi holocaust 
badenwuerttemberg home to such economic giants as 
daimlerbenz said it wanted to accept soviet jews on a special 
status called contingency refugees which would allow them to live 
and work in germany without having to apply for formal immigration 
or go through the lengthy political asylum process 
the special classification requires approval of germanys 16 
states whose top officials will discuss the issue this month 
we are not a country of immigrants detlef dauka spokesman 
for bonns interior ministry said that means soviet jews 
normally would have no possibility to come to germany except to 
apply as asylum seekers 
about 3 percent of all people claiming political asylum are 
legally accepted officials say 
dauka said the proposal regarding soviet jews was being 
considered because the opening of soviet society has made it 
difficult for jews to prove they are persecuted and entitled to 
political asylum 
at the same time rising nationalism has provoked an increase in 
antisemitic incidents in the soviet union 
an estimated 150000 soviet jews have emigrated this year to 
israel where officials say services are strained by the influx 
israeli officials believe the number of soviet jewish immigrants 
could reach 1 million by 1992 
only residents of other european community countries and ethnic 
germans can easily settle and work legally in germany the rest 
must apply for political asylum or immigrate 
badenwuerttemberg spokesman manfred zach said in the state 
capital of stuttgart that quick action was needed to help the 
soviet jews 
zach said the process should be coordinated through leaders of 
the german jewish community he said the special status should 
apply mainly to germanspeaking soviet jews those of german origin 
or those who could prove family relations in germany 
the governments interior ministry announced tuesday that the 
number of asylumseekers in germany continued to climb in november 
the ministry said 18314 people entered germany seeking asylum an 
increase over 18261 in october in september 24048 asylum 
seekers registered with the goverment 
jewish community leader heinz galinski reached at home in 
berlin for comment tuesday night hung up the teeephone before a 
question on the issue could be asked 
other jewish leaders could not be reached for comment

drivers in the east are more likely to drink 
and drive than those in the south and people in the wideopen west 
are most likely to speed a study released tuesday showed 
but westerners are slightly more likely to buckle up when they 
drive 
the louis harris poll on auto safety in america was commissioned 
by prevention magazine and general motors corp among its findings 
a significant drop 17 percent in the past five years in 
the number of young drivers who say they sometimes drink and drive 
but more affluent collegeeducated people are four times as likely 
to drink and drive than those who never graduated from high school 
in states without a mandatory seat belt law 72 percent of 
those responding would support one 
twice as many men as women admit to sometimes driving after 
drinking 28 percent to 14 percent 
seventynine percent of those surveyed support expanded use of 
police roadblocks or checkpoints to reduce drunken driving 
while 30 percent would pay an extra 500 for an air bag 38 
percent think accidental inflation is a serious problem and 35 
percent think they can trap people in their car 
greater public understanding of air bags and their benefits 
would likely result in greater willingness to pay for them said 
thomas dybdahl one of the reports authors 
the survey showed a big jump in the percentage of people who say 
they always wear seat belts in the front seat from 19 percent in a 
1984 survey to 63 percent in the recent survey 
sixtyseven percent of the drivers in the west said they always 
buckle up easterners ranked lowest at 60 percent although this 
difference is minimal the authors said 
seat belt use is reflected in education and income levels the 
survey found it said 74 percent of college grads always buckle up 
compared with 52 percent of those who didnt graduate high school 
among those with household income above 50000 73 percent always 
wear belts compared with 51 percent in the under15000 income 
bracket 
younger drivers may be increasingly aware of the hazards of 
drinking and driving the survey said 24 percent of those 18 to 29 
said they sometimes drive after drinking a drop from 41 percent in 
1984 
for those 30 to 39 the drinkinganddriving figure was 31 
percent down just 2 points from the earlier survey for the 
40to49 age group 23 percent down from 32 percent for the 
50to64 age group 14 percent down from 22 percent 
twentyseven percent of the eastern adults said they sometimes 
drink and drive in the south the figure was 15 percent one 
reason the survey said is that half of all southerners say they 
dont drink at all compared with 31 percent of easterners 
the figure for drinking and driving in the midwest was 25 
percent and in the west 21 percent 
the survey showed that 53 percent of the drivers in the midwest 
and south say they never exceed the speed limit in the east it 
was 45 percent in the west 41 percent 
and which sex is more likely to obey the speed limit women by 
a 54 percent to 44 percent margin 
the random survey of 1250 adults nationwide was done in 
november and december 1989 
the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points

a federal judge upheld a ban on guns in the 
citys public housing projects setting a precedent for the rest of 
the nation the housing authority director said tuesday 
the ruling monday by us district judge richard l williams 
marked the first time a court has decided whether public housing 
residents can be barred from having guns said richard gentry 
executive director of the richmond redevelopment and housing 
authority 
gentry said guns also are banned in public housing projects in 
chicago but that ban has not been challenged in court 
this is a unique court case he said now this can be used 
as a precedent throughout the country 
williams said the ban was part of a good faith effort to 
improve the safety and quality of life in public housing 
richmond which has one of the highest murder rates in the 
country has been plagued by drugrelated shootings and other 
violence at its 4500 public housing units a third of the citys 
600 shootings a year take place in public housing complexes 
evidence showed 
in its lawsuit challenging the gun ban and other provisions of a 
new lease the richmond tenants organization said the requirements 
made the citys 14000 public housing residents secondclass 
citizens 
williams issued an injunction that kept the lease from going 
into effect last month but after hearing testimony last week 
upheld all but a few of the lease provisions 
the widespread presence of drugs and guns have created an 
atmosphere of fear and intimidation which now permeates the public 
housing developments he wrote 
there is substantial evidence that eliminating guns will 
reduce crime in the developments and reduce accidental death 
despite conflicting expert testimony this court finds that a 
prohibition on firearms from public housing is a reasonable lease 
term williams added 
he permitted specific bans on firearms blackjacks explosive 
devices and nunchucks a martial arts weapon he struck a line 
banning weapons of any type because that could mean kitchen 
knives or anything else used to hurt someone 
williams also struck a provision that would have caused tenants 
to lose their lease if they committed misdemeanor drug or alcohol 
violations away from the public housing area 
alma barlow president of the tenants organization said she was 
disappointed with the ruling but had not decided whether to appeal 
lawyers for the central virginia legal aid society which 
represented the tenants would not comment 
gentry said tenants would be given civil court hearings before 
being thrown out for violating the lease 
it has never been our intent nor will it ever be to conduct 
raids on residents or to hassle our residents he said when we 
become aware of a problem we will be able to take action

the inventor of a device used by a woman 
to kill herself refused to answer questions tuesday during a 
hearing on whether the machine should be shelved forever 
dr jack kevorkian invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination when questioned by a prosecutor seeking a 
permanent injunction against kevorkians use of the machine 
the retired pathologist hooked a 54yearold woman with 
alzheimers disease to the machine so she could inject herself with 
a fatal dose of an anesthetic and a heartstopping drug 
kevorkian 62 was charged monday with firstdegree murder in 
the june 4 death of janet adkins of portland ore 
he refused to answer any questions when prosecutor michael 
modelski called him to the witness stand during the hearing to 
determine whether a temporary order against kevorkians use of the 
machine should be made permanent 
on the advice of counsel i invoke the fifth amendment 
kevorkian repeated to each of modelskis questions including 
requests for the doctor to state his name occupation education 
and medical background 
circuit court judge alice l gilbert adjourned the hearing until 
monday 
if kevorkian testified his right to a fair trial in a criminal 
case would be jeopardized said kevorkians attorney geoffrey 
fieger 
dr kevorkian in this case has a right to defend himself but 
he cant get on the stand while he has a criminal case against 
him fieger said 
i believe the prosecution has engaged in manipulation of the 
judicial process he said referring to the timing of the 
criminal charges filed just a day before the scheduled hearing on a 
permanent injunction 
fieger said he would ask the michigan court of appeals to 
dismiss the civil case 
kevorkian who has deferred questions about the criminal charges 
to fieger spoke to reporters briefly after the hearing 
im committed to the medical aspect of this he said adding 
that the medical community should address the rights of terminally 
ill patients to take their own lives 
kevorkian spent several hours monday night at oakland county 
jail before he was freed on 50000 bond

scientists on tuesday displayed the 
first picture taken by what will soon be the worlds most powerful 
optical telescope a huge instrument designed to peer deeper into 
space than ever before 
when it is completed the 942 million keck telescope at mauna 
kea hawaii will be the worlds largest with a mirror 10 meters 
in diameter it also is the first to be built of automated mirror 
segments 
astronomers say the keck will enable them to gaze back 12 
billion years in time by revealing light images still traveling 
toward earth 
these are really time machines given the finite speed of 
light said edward stone chairman of the california association 
of research in astronomy composed of scientists from the 
california institute of technology and the university of 
california 
the photo of galaxy ngc 1232 taken with only a quarter of the 
kecks 36 mirror segments in place more than matched the quality 
of images from the worlds largest effective telescope the 5meter 
hale telescope at palomar observatory 
the image was taken nov 24 from the wm keck observatory on 
mauna kea a 13796foot volcano on the island of hawaii 
the picture of the galaxy 65 million light years from earth in 
the constellation eridanus marks the telescopes first light 
a term astronomers use to describe the first viewing through a new 
telescope 
the photo has no particular scientific value ngc 1232 was 
selected simply to demonstrate the optical quality of the 
telescope said mirror designer jerry nelson an astronomer at the 
university of california berkeley 
when we first saw the picture we were really thrilled said 
nelson we were all hopping up and down 
the telescope wont be fully functioning until late next year 
with all mirror segments in place and precision cameras mounted to 
record the images it returns 
when it is completed the keck telescope is expected to be twice 
as powerful as the hale and far more accurate and reliable than a 
6meter soviet telescope that is frequently inoperable 
the keck differs from other large telescopes in that its mirror 
is made up of separate hexagonal mirror segments 6 feet in 
diameter the aluminumcoated mirrors are kept in alignment within 
1millionth of an inch by computercontrolled sensors 
stone said a singlepiece 10meterwide mirror probably could 
not be constructed with existing technology 
the telescope will offer research opportunities not possible 
with the hubble space telescope launched earlier this year by a 
space shuttle because it orbits earth above the distorting effects 
of the atmosphere the 15 billion hubble space telescope was 
supposed to see farther into the universe than the keck even 
though the hubble has a smaller mirror 
nasa discovered after it was launched that the hubbles mirror 
was flawed during construction rendering it less powerful than 
planned until a space shuttle crew can fix it in 1993 
however the keck with its large lightgathering mirror will 
be a better instrument for analyzing the light spectrums of stars 
stone said this will enable scientists to better understand the 
nature of the stars and calculate their speed 
by providing images that reach back 12 billion years scientists 
will see stars as they appeared some 3 billion years after the 
birth of the universe palomar by contrast reaches back only 8 
billion years 
caltech and the university of california are sharing the cost of 
the telescope caltech aided by a 70 million grant from the wm 
keck foundation put up the 87 million the project originally was 
expected to cost overruns of 72 million will be shared by the 
two universities and uc will pay the annual operating cost of 
about 3 million stone said 
nelson said mauna kea is considered the worlds best site for a 
telescope because its high altitude reduces atmospheric 
distortions but the thin air often impairs researchers thinking 
ability and causes severe headaches he said as a result 
operations must be carefully planned and monitored by the projects

the national academy of recording arts 
and sciences announced tuesday the 1989 best new artist grammy 
which was stripped from milli vanilli last month will not be 
awarded to another group or artist 
the grammy process does not and is not intended to produce a 
ranked result michael greene president of the academy said 
tuesday 
the grammy procedure is not structured as a win place or 
show situation he said in a statement there is one winner 
there is no first runnerup we either have a winner or we give no 
award 
greene said the organizations board of trustees met monday in 
new york and decided that when a grammy award is withdrawn 
following the presentation as is the case with milli vanilli the 
category will remain vacant 
the academy stripped milli vanilli of its grammy on nov 19 
after german record producer frank farian confirmed rumors that 
rob pilatus and fabrice morvan were just front men on the album 
that won the award in february as best new artist 
in a separate action the academy reaffirmed that the milli 
vanilli single blame it on the rain written by diane warren 
remains eligible for the 1990 song of the year category because the 
award is for songwriting 
all other entries from milli vanilli have been deemed 
ineligible greene said 
three milli vanilli entries were among the 8000 other entries 
in the 1990 grammy nomination process and were distributed and 
compiled before the academys decision to rescind the duos grammy 
he said 
the groups first and only album girl you know its true 
sold 7 million copies and made the two unknowns international 
stars 
pilatus and morvan both 25 said the album actually featured 
vocalists johnny davis brad howell and charles shaw 
the deception began to unravel at a 1989 concert when their 
audio system playing the album girl you know its true started 
to skip like a broken record the recording at the bristol conn 
show kept rerunning the lyrics girl you know its girl you know

ms austin told reporters recently that she had been harassed by 
her supervisors after warning last summer that pumping radioactive 
liquids from two nuclear waste storage tanks could cause the

the daily dose of government debate at the 
state capitol and the steady shuffle of students between university 
classes cant muffle the question 
is madisons long proud tradition of liberal politics student 
activism and unbending tolerance to widely divergent groups and 
views in jeopardy 
its the question lobbyist ken opins mother who lives on the 
east coast asked him after reading news accounts about a rash of 
antisemitic vandalism in madison this summer 
its the question political analysts asked after us rep 
robert kastenmeier a democrat who built a reputation as a champion 
of liberal causes was ousted by a conservative after 32 years in 
congress 
and its the question aldermen asked after a southeast asian 
refugee collecting aluminum cans to supplement her welfare checks 
was arrested under a law designed to protect recyclables in the 
city trash 
has this city of 180000 changed 
the world has changed said mayor paul r soglin a vietnam 
war protester whose political views and garb earned him the 
nickname hippie mayor during his first term of office in the 
1970s 
after 10 years in the private sector soglin returned to office 
two years ago 
but instead of beads tiedye shirts and ponchos he sports 
tweed jackets and striped ties and he doesnt march past the 
capitol with a throng of students to lobby for the latest cause in 
social justice instead he strolls downtown to court business 
interests 
madison is no longer the emerald city said orlando bell 
president of the madison chapter of the national association for 
the advancement of colored people it has bigcity problems and 
it is going to have to find some bigcity solutions 
madisons enthrallment with its proud liberal past allowed 
problems to rear mostly unnoticed during the late 1970s and 1980s 
bell said 
during the time we were in suspended animation these problems 
have been knocking on our door he said 
striking the deepest blow to the citys image this year was the 
spate of antisemitic vandalism including the cutting of brake 
lines on a bus carrying school children from a jewish camp that 
nearly caused a tragedy 
the incidents forced police to guard temples and synogogues 
during recent jewish holidays 
antisemitism had finally hit home said the rev frederick 
trost president of the wisconsin conference of the united church 
of christ people were astonished and shocked by it 
added mary rouse dean of students at the university of 
wisconsin it was a very painful reminder that discrimination 
occurs in every community 
added to that 
the nov 6 ouster of kastenmeier whose incessant pursuit of 
civil rights nuclear disarmament and openness in government became 
a symbol of the citys political climate during the 1960s and 
1970s both democrats and republicans say political newcomer scott 
klug capitalized on voter dissatisfaction with congress in general 
the arrest of the refugee woman by police using an 
antiscavenging ordinance passed by the city council prosecutors 
dropped the charge in september after one alderman declared during 
a council meeting that his colleagues had become more interested in 
giving tax breaks to rich companies than protecting the interests 
of the poor 
the attack on two white youths by black youths in september 
also in november a gang of about 20 young men and women attacked 
and robbed three people outside a tavern 
but in madison tradition instead of downplaying the incidents 
city leaders condemned them as threats to the citys prevailing 
ideology and discussed solutions 
clergy joined to assist the jewish community and allay fears 
with impassioned sermons and sharply worded editorials 
the university instituted mandatory classes to promote racial 
sensitivity 
the outpouring of community response has been decisive and 
overwhelming state rep david clarenbach said law 
enforcement the religious community minorities have spoken with 
one voice 
opin the lobbyist said the incidents did not surprise him as 
much as the reaction 
ive been jewish a long time and ive encountered a lot of 
antisemitism he said i dont think madison is any different 
in its degree of antisemitism whats primarily different is 
the communitys response 
even with the initial response city leaders wonder if they have 
done enough the naacp is seeking to build a coalition of activists 
similar to the one formed in madison in the 1960s to advance the 
causes of peace civil rights feminism and gay rights 
the university with its 45000student body is seeking 
additional uses of its resources in fighting problems 
we have to renew our commitment to civil rights and human 
rights every day ms rouse said people of all walks of life 
have come together to the extent that you can take something that 
is ugly and painful and make it positive weve done a great 
deal

the old fishing platform sags held 
up by ropes a few rotting boards and perhaps the ghosts of 
fishermen who lived at a time when indians pulled as many salmon as 
they wanted from the columbia river 
david sohappy yakima indian religious leader and rebel 
believes that is a right worth a lifelong fight 
i want to go fishing whenever i feel like it with no strings 
attached whatsoever sohappy says 
it is an idea as dated as the oldfashioned platform long since 
supplanted by powerboats but for sohappy there is no compromise 
on his belief that indians have the right to fish when and where 
they want guaranteed by the yakima indian nations treaty of 1855 
despite a 20month prison term a stroke and the threat of 
eviction from his ramshackle home he refuses to give up 
in 1984 us district judge george boldt of tacoma issued a 
ruling limiting indian rights to half the harvestable salmon and 
steelhead in the puget sound region that decision arose in part 
from protests sohappy and other indian fishermen began in 1968 over 
the states restrictions on their fishing 
but for all the fuss he has created sohappy rarely fishes 
preferring to spend his time watching soap operas and news a frail 
65yearold man with one arm crippled by the stroke he speaks 
barely above a mumble and must lean on an old golf putter to walk 
i speak softly but carry a big stick he joked brandishing 
the putter 
in the latest chapter of this rebels saga sen brock adams 
dwash and sen daniel inouye dhawaii are asking the 
government to stop eviction efforts against sohappy 
the government argues that the cooks landing fishing site where 
sohappy lives with his wife and some of his seven children is 
supposed to be a river access point for all indians not a dwelling 
site 
sohappy built a longhouse a communal dwelling that also serves 
as a church on this spit of land on the shore of the milewide 
columbia east of vancouver wash in the early 1960s 
the longhouse was a protest over the 40 homes and 37 fishing 
sites of indians that were flooded by construction of bonneville 
dam in 1937 the government agreed in 1945 to replace those homes 
and fishing sites but has made little progress 
sohappy says he has a historic right to live and fish on the 
river and he vows never to leave the home he returned to after his 
release from prison in may 1988 
move out and let them win no way he said we still own 
the land sohappy a leader of the indian feather religion 
speaks of the dire consequences awaiting whites who harass indians 
theyre just asking for trouble he said people have told 
them to leave us alone if they dont nature will step in and make 
you spend millions of dollars on weatherrelated things 
buried in the 365page appropriations bill for the department of 
the interior was one paragraph directing interior secretary manuel 
lujan to reconsider the 21year battle to evict sohappy and his 
family it asks lujan to meet with the yakima tribe and report back 
to congress within four months the bill still awaits the 
presidents signature 
the fight over his home is just one of many sohappy rebellions 
sohappy and his son david jr were arrested by federal and state 
wildlife after an undercover sting operation called salmonscam 
in 1981 and 1982 they were accused of selling 317 fish out of 
season 
the sohappys were convicted in federal court in los angeles in 
1983 and sentenced to five years in prison they served 20 months 
each and remain on probation 
a yakima tribal court jury in 1987 acquitted them of tribal 
poaching charges that trial labeled tradition on trial won 
international attention from human rights groups 
some members were angry when the tribe prosecuted sohappy in the 
salmonscam case tribal prosecutor jack fiander said others 
were glad a violator of tribal fishing laws was on trial 
the tribe for 25 years has set fishing seasons for its members 
and regulated the type of equipment they could use fiander said 
they insisted on prosecuting sohappy to protect tribal sovereignty 
in such matters he said 
david sohappy like any human being is neither all good nor 
all bad fiander said sometimes he was both

stereo vcr this one piece of hardware should be as central to 
your home video system as the tv tube itself its much more 
versatile and its the easiest purchase to justify 
a stereo vcr converts any television into a stereo tv by 
delivering its right and left audio channels to your home audio 
system its the biggest cheapest single improvement you can make 
to a conventional tv 
with the stereo vcr hooked up and tuned in and your good old 
19inch blackandwhite philco between the speakers you have 
stereo tv 
it gives you much finer acoustic detail to go along with the 
video image and youll be surprised at how much a good soundtrack 
enhances your viewing 
and theres a lot to hear most major tv markets have more than 
one stereo broadcaster most cable systems can deliver a stereo 
signal and most videocassettes sold and rented today are in 
stereo 
with that much programming available its just foolish not to 
upgrade 
when youre shopping remember a twohead or fourhead 
or hifi vcr isnt necessarily a stereo model every vcr needs 
one tape head to play and one head to record fourhead models 
allow for slowmotion freeze frames and other special effects 
with a stereo vcr you also get sap or secondary audio program 
services also known as mts or multichannel television sound pbs 
stations use it for descriptive narrative weather reports and 
simultaneous translation to a second language 
fullfeatured models retail for 300 to 450 but basic models 
can be had for less than 250 
stereo tv monitor heres where shopping pays discounters 
offer stereoready 25inch tv monitors for just less than 400 
and basic 27inch models for just more than 400 these are just 
about perfect for home viewing 
this is where belttightening gets tough because the more bells 
and whistles you tack on to that basic picture tube the faster 
that big ticket fattens 
then you find yourself paying 50 for delivery of a 2500 
35inch behemoth that claims to have 700 lines of resolution 
pictureinpicture superwoofer and a microwave popcorn maker 
singlehandedly you have tipped the economy into recession and 
yourself into debtors prison 
and that bigger tube whets your appetite for that sweet 500 
laserdisc player that has a 60 percent sharper picture letterbox 
formats cd sound and handles audio compact discs a whole new way 
to spend money 
be strong or at least have the decency to wait for the 
afterchristmas sales 
video player this is the biggest bargain for a budget 
discounters offer rugged playonly vhs machines for less than 
150 for the simple pleasure of home video viewing theyre hard 
to beat

it wasnt long ago you may recall when the 
airwaves and newspapers and books and magazines promoted the idea 
of leverage of borrowng to the limit of using other peoples 
money opm to succeed 
leverage was the way to wealth you were told and if you had 
doubts the promoter of the notion could parade before you names of 
some mighty successful people such as michael milken and a 
halfdozen local developers 
the concept had plenty of cant lose relatives such as 
you can only lose pennies if you buy penny stocks and 
anyone with common sense can make it big in commodities and 
yes you can outwit the stock market 
all such ideas have been slain by the realities as popular 
economist howard ruff says among the most vicious of all crimes is 
the slaughter of popular theories by brutal gangs of facts 
ruff who made a name years ago by forecasting bad times takes 
a look back at the carnage wrought by some of those flighty ideas 
generated by the freelooseandeasy floosy 1980s he identifies 
these among the victims 
stock prices will rise and rise and rise 
well for a time they did and as time grew people became more 
convinced than ever it was true those too young to recall earlier 
bloodbaths thought they had identified new truths when they were 
succumbing to old lies 
the phrasing of those truths was very familiar the old 
rules dont apply it was said were in a new era it was 
explained those who stuck to the old rules were viewed as 
hasbeens unable to adjust to the new reality 
you can borrow borrow and borrow without every worrying about 
debt pay back in cheaper dollars take a tax deduction and 
eventually sell your investment for a killing dont you know that 
prices always go up 
one of the popular selfhelp books of the early 1980s managed to 
squeeze the entire mood of the times into its title how to 
borrow your way to a great fortune starting from scratch 
it might have been possible for a time in the early 1980s you 
could profit from real estate investments but take a paper loss for 
tax purposes you could raise your rents you could repay your 
loans in cheaper dollars 
uncle sam rescinded the tax benefits and that put real estate 
in the category of just another business then inflation was 
brought to manageable levels as the economy slowed it became more 
difficult to raise rents and finally it became impossible to find 
buyers especially at inflated prices 
reviewing the 80s one of the more remarkable observations you 
can make is that these and similar errors werent made only by the 
informed or by those convinced that they had discovered a quick way 
to riches 
some of the allegedly wisest financial brains in the universe 
fell for such notions bankers brokers builders insurance 
executives financial advisers corporate officials corporate 
raiders and notforprofit institutions 
and oh yes that profligate old rake uncle sam had the best 
time of all he squandered borrowed refinanced and borrowed more 
and for a time had the experts convinced it was true that 
you neednt ever face the consequences

pictures from a scrapbook of horrors stare 
up from the table the broken faces and bodies of street children 
murdered witnesses say by police 
it is the work of selfappointed executioners who impose the 
death penalty for petty crimes or sniffing glue or just hanging 
out sometimes they torture their young victims first 
they work swiftly unfettered by legal niceties like arrest or 
trial due process has never quite caught on in guatemala which 
has one of the worlds worst human rights records 
the people who are killing these children probably feel they 
are doing good said bruce harris director of casa alianza a 
branch of the new yorkbased covenant house that runs several 
childrens shelters in guatemala 
harris showed yet another picture of nahaman carmona lopez a 
13yearold casa alianza boy on his deathbed 
his murder began harris crusade to bring the killers of street 
children to justice and exposed guatemalas ugly secret 
he was the kid who had to die to bring this to our 
attention the first victim from a casa alianza shelter harris 
said 
since nahamans death in march casa alianza has filed criminal 
complaints against scores of police officers prominent 
international human rights groups have issued reports condemning 
official inertia western diplomats have tried without success to 
persuade the government to act 
there has been no official comment on the murders and no 
response to associated press requests for an interview with police 
or a statement from them 
in most ways nahamans murder was typical of the fate that has 
befallen scores of rootless children in the crimeridden streets of 
guatemala city he just took longer to die 
the police hate us said william chalin 14 a friend of 
nahamans who is nursing several fractured ribs from a recent 
encounter 
five national police officers on their way to work saw nahaman 
and eight other children sniffing glue two blocks from the casa 
alianza shelter 
witnesses said nahaman resisted when police tried to pour glue 
on his head a common curbside punishment for sniffing 
it was a fatal error 
the officers kicked him viciously then left him for dead the 
witnesses said by the time an ambulance came someone had covered 
nahaman with paper flowers and white crepe a funeral tradition for 
children in guatemala 
he wasnt dead but was mortally wounded nahaman spent 10 days 
in intensive care regaining consciousness only long enough to tell 
a casa alianza social worker he knew he was dying 
harris said the boy had bruises over 70 percent of his body six 
fractured ribs two broken fingers open wounds on his head and 
face a ruptured liver brain injuries and a slash on his back 
casa alianza demanded an investigation 
president vinicio cerezos human rights adviser eliona de 
rosario acuna ordonez responded that police had acted on their 
personal initiative and not under official orders 
harris and his colleagues began gathering evidence 
they accumulated statements from witnesses autopsy reports 
photographs death certificates and other material about attacks on 
63 casa alianza children including 13 who died one was only 8 
years old 
so far casa alianza has charges pending against 35 national 
police officers three treasury police officers three 
governmentlicensed private officers a military policeman nine 
civilians and nine unidentified attackers 
the charges range from murder and torture to abuse of authority 
among the defendants are four of the police officers accused of 
beating nahaman 
casa alianzas crusade has provoked an ugly reaction its 
workers have been attacked and threatened child witnesses 
including several who saw nahaman carmona beaten have been 
assaulted 
we got a funeral wreath the other day harris said they 
know who we all are and the work we are doing 
mario salazar a casa alianza street worker said police had 
threatened him the police see these kids as the scum of 
society he said they tell me i am wasting my time with 
them 
murders of street children coincide with a crime wave of such 
alarming proportions that law and order is a pivotal issue in 
guatemalas presidential campaign 
an estimated 5000 street children and hundreds of youth gangs 
roam guatemala city 
i can understand the police being frustrated harris said 
these kids arent angels but nothing excuses the organized 
killing of children 
amnesty international which also has denounced brazilian police 
for murdering street children said the desire to control crime 
cannot be used as an excuse for violating basic human rights 
including the right to life 
no one is sure how many children the streetcorner executioners 
have killed casa alianza can act only on behalf of those in its 
shelters and the authorities have yet to investigate any of the 
cases 
powerful forces impel children into the streets 
many come from families in such dire poverty that 10 people 
share a single room others are among the thousands orphaned by 
political violence that has torn guatemala for 30 years 
their lives are precarious and dangerous said a recent 
report by americas watch a human rights monitoring group based in 
new york 
many of them sniff glue to alleviate their hunger many of 
their families live on the streets others survive alone petty 
street crime is often their only source of food or money 
juan jose rodil a former interior minister said 
we lack orphanages youth homes effective juvenile courts 
our juvenile detention centers are centers of putrefaction that 
create little monsters but you dont cut off your head when you 
have a headache

mr and mrs bridge 
 
india bridge cant comment about the current political situation 
because her husband hasnt yet told her what to believe she is 
you see a woman of the 1920s when women were expected to cook and 
sew and take care of the children and maybe play bridge 
walter bridge knows what he believes in business republicanism 
and solid midwestern values he is oblivious to any of his wifes 
aspirations when his longtime secretary confesses her desperate 
love for him he responds in cool disbelief 
three decades in the lives of india and walter are traced in 
mr and mrs bridge which stars paul newman and joanne 
woodward in the best of their long collaboration in films they are 
marvels to watch two academy award professionals employing all 
their skills to bring life and shading into a pair of seemingly 
humdrum characters 
mr and mrs bridge is the 15th feature film of james ivory 
director ismail merchant producer and ruth prawer jhabvala 
writer their work is unfailingly literate and meticulously 
produced a masterpiece theater of the big screen this is not 
a putdown masterpiece theater is the single reliable oasis in 
televisions halfvast wasteland 
this time the trio have chosen the muchloved novels mrs 
bridge and mr bridge by evan s connell there is no linear 
plot the story of a marriage is told in a series of anecdotes that 
have little connection except for employing the same protagonists 
the central figure is the frustrated and confused india born a few 
generations too early 
woodward brings pathos to india bridge without a hint of 
pityseeking newman has the more difficult job of submerging his 
famed charisma into the grayish hues of the granitelike walter 
only an actor of his skill could preven mr bridge from becoming a 
bore 
ivory the bostonians room with a view is richly 
talented in evoking the spirit and the look of a bygone time and 
place he has directed an expert cast particularly blythe danner 
as indias freethinking best friend and simon callow as a waspish 
psychiatrist the bridges children are well played by robert sean

havana 
 
havana 1958 a time and place when rum flowed as freely as fast 
bucks at the craps table and sex was as open as a 50foot ketch 
americans came in wild abandon to soak up the withering spoils of 
corrupt cuban dictator fulgencio batista 
it was the twilight of the aristocracy and the dawn of the 
peasant when the rumba met the revolutionary and more than just 
the music died 
sydney pollack shakes the death rattle in havana his 
bittersweet love story of a highrolling gambler named jack played 
by robert redford who comes to havana for the biggest poker game 
of his career and instead falls in love with roberta duran lena 
olin a swedish revolutionary 
roberta is married to an influential aristocrat raul julia who 
supports fidel castro and the rebel forces 
redford looking like he just stepped off the set of the way 
we were in his allamerican 50s garb arrives in havana on the 
car ferry just as batistas thugs board the boat in search of 
contraband translation weapons for the rebel forces roberta 
looks mighty sweaty through it all and an effete food writer 
daniel davis who we immediately know works for the company 
translation cia looks on with grand bemusement and interest 
robertas car carries a cache of americanissue military weapons 
and ammunition she hires jack to drive the car through customs 
because she fears batistas men already have her fingered they 
probably noticed the look of pure terror on her face 
jack a middleaged guy whos gone through life committed to 
nothing but his one pleasures and nomad existence is fascinated by 
roberta a sensual deeply committed woman committed to her 
marriage and husband and to the cause shes everything he isnt 
jack is also drawn towards arturo robertas husband who 
mesmerizes with his eyes his genteel ways but the revolution is 
meaningless for jack who merely follows the game wherever it might 
be 
but these are dangerous times with dangerous players the durans 
are arrested arturo is believed dead roberta is taken off to be 
tortured

jacks loyalties to gambling and to his emotions collide he 
carries his desire to save roberta to the big game with its 
selective group of heavy hitters including the head of batistas 
security police jack does a nono he mixes politics with cards 
but through his wits he manages to free roberta he hides her 
in his rooms but she doesnt stay the revolution cant wait 
cuba is falling apart as the new year approaches batista is 
about to flee and castro is about to come down from the hills 
roberta puts her life on the line and the rebels regard her as a 
leader jack puts his life on the line to find her and spirit her 
to safety in miami and especially by falling in love with her 
it is the eve of success for the revolution and heres where 
the screenplay falls completely apart a woman of such intense 
commitment to such an intense cause would hardly abandon it and the 
people who depend on her for a man especially one like jack 
but a predictable twist shakes her back to her destiny 
pollack avoids the polemics of the rebel cause and aims his 
camera on the decadence and brutality of the batista regime hes 
in his hemingway mode the colors the booze the women the 
fearlessness the intrigue the flirtation with death and dying 
but the movie lacks any real hard edge or toughness 
the movie ends years later theres a voiceover as jack gazes 
out to sea in key west fla watching the sunset and the ships 
afterall roberta might be on one another hemingway nudge 
pollack is a thoughtful and intelligent director who is very 
good with character development he wins with roberta the jurys 
still out with jack 
unfortunately theres very little sensuality between the two 
stars redford is far too restrained and distant to add fuel to 
olins natural fire she is an extremely talented and passionate 
actress who scorched the screen in enemies a love story and 
the unbearable lightness of being another love story set 
against the politics confusion and death of a revolution 
redford is likewise a cold fish in whats supposed to be one of 
the films hot scenes and an example of the fast life in havana a 
menage a trois with a two american tourists 
there are touches of grim wit in havana provided by alan 
arkin as the casino boss and second in command to mobster meyer

computers are challenging the sandbox and 
easel in preschool programs across the country although educators 
have mixed opinions about introducing technology to toddlers 
youngsters should begin as early as possible to view computers 
as a tool said suzanne thouvenelle vice president of an 
alexandria va firm that developed software for young children 
but john lindley principal of south colby elementary school in 
port orchard wash countered children need to be involved in 
active learning computers are too passive computer introduction 
to them is something they get too much of already and thats 
television 
even bernard gifford vice president of education marketing for 
apple computer inc acknowledged that computers in preschool may 
be a bit too early 
i believe strongly in making it available to kids but i would 
be reluctant to impose a structured program at that age i think 
the most important skills for youngsters at ages 3 and 4 frankly 
are social skills 
in a sampling of head start preschool classes around the 
country children used computers to create animals and plant 
imaginary gardens one program allowed them to combine facial 
features on the computer while dictating stories to their teachers 
the youngsters were so excited and motivated by the computers 
that attendance improved thouvenelle said parents also showed a 
greater interest in their childrens work and enthusiastically 
volunteered to work in the classroom 
walt disney computer software inc recently introduced a line 
of software that had been tested at two burbank calif 
preschools nowhere on the package does it say educational 
software notes sam palahnuk walt disney product developer 
what we claim this stuff is a fun exploratory software for your 
kid 
fun is what 3yearold heather leffler 4yearold emily koleini 
and her 2yearold brother massoud were having during a 
demonstration of the software at an upscale virginia mall with 
parents nearby the children watched in delight the colorful 
animated graphics of mickey mouse and his friends and listened to 
the digitalized speech fully orchestrated music and reallife 
sound effects 
the youngsters used numbers to help mickey mouse plan a birthday 
party for goofy named animals at a county fair with letters of the 
alphabet and identified shapes as mickey performed magic acts 
it certainly isnt boring said andrea fleury of mclean 
va as she threatened to leave her 3yearold who had tinkered 
with the computer for nearly two hours 
we went for the approach let kids really have fun and theyll 
learn as a side effect said palahnuk we dont want to claim 
that its going to teach your kid anything we think it will but 
you start getting into teaching philosophy and curriculum and all 
that kind of thing 
a study by the national association of elementary school 
principals found that elementary school children are more likely to 
use computers in school than high school or college students and 
even 15 percent of kindergartners and preschoolers in the public 
schools use computers 
research dating back to 1932 showed that technology as simple 
as a typewriter had significant effects on the reading and writing 
performance of elementary students said james e dezel 
international business machines corp vice president the 
technology available to schools today and in the future could bring 
about amazing results 
ibm sponsored the threeyear study exploring classroom uses of 
computers with children and parents in head start a popular 
federal preschool program that provides education meals and health 
screening for poor youngsters aged 3 through 5 
eleven of head starts 1300 programs participated including 
four in baltimore md and one each in winder ga deridder la 
new york city lexington ky toledo ohio las cruces nm and 
dayton ohio 
head start was used because of its emphasis on providing 
equity for kids from lowincome families said thouvenelle vice 
president of mobius corp which developed new software after 
evaluating the program 
she said the software meets the guidelines of the national 
association for the education of young children as being 
developmentally appropriate association officials take no 
position on computers in preschool 
our major concern was whether or not computers were 
applicable or would work for preschool children 3 and 4 years 
old said thouvenelle a second concern she said was whether 
young children can use computers as a tool the same way they use 
blocks or easel painting 
each of the 44 classrooms participating in the experiment had 
two computers that shared a printer mouse and a large 
touchsensitive device known as the powerpad thouvenelle said the 
powerpad is important to young children who often do not have the 
fine motor skills needed to hold a pen or pencil 
the computers ran a program called kidsway which came equipped 
with voice cards in the native language of the parents of the 
children who participated such as spanish navajo swahili and 
japanese 
a key finding said thouvenelle is that computers should be 
available and accessible to youngsters in the classroom the same 
as reading materials art work blocks sandbox and other socalled 
learning center areas preschoolers should not be marched down the 
hall to a computer laboratory she said 
she said a lack of teacher training and support remains a key 
drawback to the program 
winnie porter a 12year teaching veteran of kindergarten 
through fifth grade in san francisco is against pushing academics 
too early in kindergarten computers she said are good as long 
as kids are allowed to explore with them and they are not forced on 
them 
i think children could learn what they would learn from a 
computer as they would learn from other things said pat 
wynneevans who retired last year as a san francisco teacher 
with many school districts plagued by tight budgets lindley 
the south colby principal said if i had to make a financial 
decision between buying big blocks for 400500 and a computer for 
850 id go with the big blocks every time 
kids need active learning computers are not 
multidimensional also you want children using their imagination 
rather than looking at a screen lindley said

the next presidential campaign will likely 
feature a fiery debate over affirmative action but one party will 
call it simple justice the other will label it unfair quotas and 
voters will have to decide whom to believe 
sen jesse helms rode to reelection in north carolina after 
accusing his black challenger democrat harvey gantt of supporting 
racial quotas and while some denounced the tactic others detected 
a way to bolster the identity and electoral strength of the 
republican party 
helms came from 13 points behind to win comfortably i think 
solely on this issue said gop consultant roger stone it is 
the kind of cutting social issue that conservatives need to hold 
onto the white house 
a number of recent developments suggest voters may be hearing a 
lot more about affirmative action and racial quotas between now and 
november 1992 
democratic congressional leaders have renewed their pledge to 
once again pass a civil rights bill that president bush branded a 
quota bill and vetoed in the last congress 
virginia gov doug wilder the only democrat blatantly testing 
the 1992 presidential waters blasted bushs characterization of 
the bill and said it gave helms phony ammunition i know what 
racial quotas are i have experienced them firsthand wilder who 
is black said in a letter to bush 
william bennett the new republican party chairman defended 
helms use of the quota issue and said he was ready to debate 
affirmative action if the democrats bring it up most americans 
are troubled by racial preference programs he said 
disaffected democrats at a conservative forum predicted doom 
for their party unless more moderate voices are heard until we 
give up fear and discuss these issues rationally and logically we 
are going to continue to lose said former new york mayor ed 
koch 
prominent democrats say their party has a sound position but 
others have distorted it 
i dont know what there is to redefine said party chairman 
ron brown who is black the democratic party and its chairman in 
particular vehemently oppose quotas we vehemently oppose anything 
that could lead to reverse discrimination the legislation that the 
democratic congress sent forward to the president was not a quota 
bill it was supported by a number of conservative republicans 
but the democrats including gantt himself acknowledge that 
they havent communicated well with voters many of whom equate 
affirmative action with quotas as stone noted harvey gantt ran 
up and down north carolina saying he wasnt for quotas but nobody 
believed him 
working against the democrats is a feeling among some voters 
that the civil rights agenda of the 1960s has been fulfilled that 
affirmative action was supposed to be temporary and smallscale and 
has outlived its time 
but gantt said hundreds of years of discrimination cannot be 
remedied in two decades thats not even one generation he 
said we need to do it and we need to remove the stigma that 
were going to discriminate against whites or were going to 
promote blacks who arent qualified none of that is true 
many democrats maintain the heart of the matter is economics 
they say republicans want to divert attention from the recession 
and the whole idea of affirmative action is more threatening now 
because jobs are scarce 
this issue is about a shrinking economic pie and people 
thinking someones going to give their slice to somebody else 
said democratic strategist mike mccurry 
you have to recast the debate to show the republicans are 
trying to peddle fear instead of a plan to get the economy going 
and you have to have an answer for the working person who fears for 
his job he added you have to say my plan is to develop a 
redhot economy so we all have jobs 
republican analyst doug bailey thinks his party too should 
look at the big picture he said it would be a big political 
mistake to lean heavily on affirmative action to fill the void 
left by the end of the cold war and the splintering of the gop on 
abortion and taxes 
it turns off a large corps of moderate voters northern 
suburban voters who have supported the repulican party in the 
past bailey said they will not want to see a party 
intentionally choose an issue even though it may have some merit 
which divides people on racial lines 
however stone said the theme would appeal to a group that is 
equally if not more important to the party bluecollar reagan 
democrats and he maintained it could be pursued without the gop 
appearing to be insensitive or divisive 
you can use other issues to illustrate your desire for 
economic growth in the minority community stone said go out 
and campaign against quotas but for enterprise zones and greater 
financial assistance for minority education 
but the democrats firmly believe they hold the higher ground on 
civil rights and can persuade voters of that foreshadowing the 
rhetoric to come wilder has accused bush of failing to provide 
moral leadership and brown called his veto of the civil rights bill 
a disgrace 
he had an important choice to make the party chairman said 
and he chose the politics of jesse helms and david duke rather 
than the politics of martin luther king and abraham lincoln

international travelers arriving at kennedy 
airport may think the us customs inspectors checking their 
luggage look a tad babyfaced and theyre right some are as 
young as 14 
the youths are part of the boy scouts of americas explorer 
program but this group is not just interested in earning merit 
badges theyre looking for drugs weapons and counterfeit goods 
these explorers are involved in nearly every aspect of customs 
activities from searching foreign cargo planes to xraying cartons 
of frozen shrimp 
before going out in the field they attend classes where they 
learn essentials like search arrest and seizure techniques and how 
to conduct a proper patdown later theyll also perform 
surveillance with agents investigating money laundering and child 
pornography 
sunds exciting right most days it is the group insists they 
get to meet a lot of celebrities steve martin and mel brooks among 
them but they also discover theres a downside as well 
like rummaging through someones sweaty dirty underwear or 
sniffing the contents of a suspicious vial only to learn a dozen 
sneezes too late that its chili powder or being pelted with 
overripe illegal fruit by passengers who believe if i cant 
have it neither can you 
yeah i came in here really thinking that every day was going 
to be like miami vice said donald pearce 20 of queens 
trust me its not 
the program which began in 1984 is designed to give handson 
experience and help participants decide if they want a career in 
law enforcement said customs officer patricia leyden post 
supervisor 
it also gives them a different view of what life is like 
she said some of them come from disadvantaged homes or 
neighborhoods where kids dont grow up with the greatest dreams in 
the world this program hopefully teaches them they can do 
something positive with their lives 
the latter is what attracted pearce he joined the group at 15 
and is in college pursuing a degree in criminal justice 
i grew up in a rapidly changing community the crime rate was 
going up drugs were everywhere i could have stayed out on the 
streets with my friends but i knew where they were headed 
pearce said 
i didnt want to be 21 with a ged and have a motorcycle be the 
most important thing in my life 
nationwide some 11 million youths are involved in explorer 
programs that run the gamut from movie producing to medicine and 
commercial art to aerospace engineering 
brian archimbaud director of exploring for the boy scout 
council in new york said the focus shifted from camping and nature 
programs around 1970 after a survey showed senior scouts wanted 
careeroriented programs 
they also not surprisingly wanted a program that had girls 
in it archimbaud said 
the 11 males and three females at the kennedy post who range in 
age from 14 to 20 nearly blend in with their official us customs 
counterparts helping enforce the laws of 40 federal agencies 
only their youthful faces and trendy hairdos give them away 
dressed in the customs uniform of starched white shirts and blue 
trousers they politely answer travelers questions as they look 
through luggage for contraband 
though the explorers havent been in on any big busts they have 
had some small successes 
charles sierra a serious bearded 19yearold who refused to 
smile for a photographer because he was on duty found a 
carton of guns in a shipment of luggage while working cargo 
inspection 
david chianes a 16yearold nicknamed bart because of his 
simpsonlike hairdo uncovered 40 ounces of opium inside some 
hollowed tree branches while working the mailroom detail they 
were just regular branches but they smelled funny the youthful 
sleuth said 
and then there was the great mango caper said robert nici 
19 giving a companion a high five 
nici tie slightly askew busily chomping gum recalls how he 
discovered an illegal cache of mangoes inside a caribbean womans 
suitcase he was the one who got pelted 
you think youve got the big load here the one thats going 
to make medellin cartel crumble and it turns out to be illegal 
fruit 
though he made light of his big bust leyden gently reminded him 
that he might have stopped another mediterranean fruit fly 
infestation a fact that prompted another high five 
of all the jobs the explorers seem to like doing plane searches 
best 
its the lttle kids in them leyden said they get to go 
in and search the electrical systems under floors looking for 
whatever 
most volunteer between 10 and 30 hours a month at the airport 
they also give antidrug lectures at high schools and community 
fairs 
to become an explorer no previous scouting experience is 
necessary members must be between 14 and 20 and if in high 
school maintain a c average the mix nationwide is 60 percent 
male and 40 percent female 
though the group falls under the auspices of the boy scouts the 
program is run through the participating agency or business 
archimbaud said about 60 percent of the explorers go into some 
aspect of their career posts two former members of the jfk post 
now are working as fulltime customs inspectors 
the rest go off in a totally different direction archimbaud 
said thats one of the programs main advantages they get to 
experience different careers before theyre forced to make a 
serious commitment 
he knows firsthand the benefits of the program his daughter was 
a journalism explorer at a dallas newspaper 
by her exposure to a newspaper she got a real good sense of 
what the career had to offer the pluses the drawbacks pause 
and as a result shes in law school today

us and european companies dump 
millions of tons of toxic waste in latin america every year 
leaving poisonous residues that health officials say will endanger 
lives for decades 
everything from household trash to radioactive sludge is sent to 
the region because lax antipollution laws make disposal easier and 
cheaper 
waste exporters say they are doing nothing wrong but 
environmentalists claim latin americans are not being told the full 
story behind the toxic garbage they receive 
scientists in brazil say the toxic waste dumped haphazardly in 
rivers marshlands or earth wells since the late 1960s causes 
cancers birth defects nerve damage and blood disorders 
this is an illicit trade shrouded in secrecy and often done 
by small unregistered companies that is devastating the 
environment and will affect generations to come said dr anthony 
wong president of the brazilian society of toxicology and director 
of the sao paulo poison control center 
no precise figures are available for latin america but mostafa 
tolla director of the un environmental program estimates that 
40 million tons of toxic waste entered the third world in 1989 
the united states which generates 275 million tons of hazardous 
garbage a year is the worlds leading waste exporter 
american companies wanting to export hazardous waste must tell 
the environmental protection agency 
such notifications rose from 12 in 1980 to 626 in 1989 a 
growing share of the waste went to brazil mexico argentina and 
the caribbean according to epa documents 
latin america is a perfect dumping ground said rubens born 
director in brazil for greenpeace the international environmental 
group theres lots of space loads of corrupt inspectors and 
widespread ignorance of the problem 
waste exporters say wastes are tightly monitored by the epa and 
shipments could not leave the united states if they contained 
dangerous levels of toxins they also say the disposal methods they 
practice in foreign countries are comparable to those in the united 
states 
latin health officials argue that poorly paid illequipped port 
inspectors are easily bribed to sign consent forms for importing 
hazardous waste or to look the other way when cargoes are disposed 
of illegally 
us law says foreign countries must be notified about waste 
shipments but many latin governments complain about the quality of 
the information 
the information we receive from the us epa is grossly 
misleading said dr waldemar f almeida head of brazils 
national institute of health quality control we are rarely 
informed of the quantity the type of waste or its destination 
wendy grieder director of the epas international office in 
washington responded in a telephone interview 
waste is shipped with the understanding of all countries 
involved latin countries are told through our embassies what kind 
of waste they are getting how much and the point of exit and 
entry 
a 1988 report by the epa inspector general said however that 
the agency did not know how much waste was shipped abroad or which 
exporters failed to comply with requirements for notification of 
intent 
foreign firms often approach debtridden latin governments with 
offers of public works projects or increased investment in return 
for permission to dump waste 
in 1988 a new york company offered to build schools hospitals 
and roads in san clemente peru in return for the right to dispose 
of incinerator ash near the city after public protests peruvian 
officials rejected the offer 
on july 7 1989 the summit cement and development corp asked 
the bahamas government for permission to blend 88000 tons a year 
of hazardous solvents with prime fuels to fire cement kilns on 
grand bahama island according to company documents 
in return summit promised to create 180 jobs and give 45 
million to the caribbean island the government turned the offer 
down 
hazardous wastes would have been unloaded and burned 50 yards 
from where cruise ships dock in the harbor said edward st 
george chairman of the bahamas port authority for a few jobs 
we would have polluted the island and severely damaged our 
reputation with tourists 
the associated press telephoned several times to the office of 
the company owner finn moller in alhambra calif his secretary 
said he would have no comment 
chile argentina guatemala and bolivia have received offers 
from us and european companies to build incinerators and dump 
sites for foreign waste government officials of those countries 
told the ap all offers were refused 
jim vallette a greenpeace coordinator in washington dc 
said these governments have so far resisted pressure to enter 
potentially lucrative dumping contracts because nationalists will 
accuse them of pandering to uncle sams interests 
environmentalists say the cash offers are tempting for latin 
american governments which have a combined foreign debt of more 
than 400 billion 
we are being forced to choose between poverty and poison 
said juan shroder founder of the environmental group earth alert 
in buenos aires 
some waste is intended for use in development projects 
in january international energy resources inc of greenwich 
conn offered to underwrite the cost of resurfacing 400 miles of 
roads in guatemala with 55 million tons of ash from us municipal 
incinerators 
the government backed out after greenpeace told guatemalan 
authorities the ash contained dangerous levels of arsenic cadmium 
and mercury 
douglas berardo president of the company said the chemicals 
did not pose a health or ecological threat because the ash had been 
washed and what toxicity remained would be immobilized when 
the ash was mixed with concrete 
everything was done according to the epas specifications 
he said by telephone from greenwich this ash is clean 
he said venezuela jamaica the dominican republic and san 
andres island in colombia had refused similar deals 
several european and us scrap suppliers have mixed toxic 
sludge with ordinary metals meant to be recycled by latin american 
industries 
last year greenpeace complained about a shipment of 430 metric 
tons of toxic zinc residues from belgium italy and denmark to 
brazils produquimica co said eduardo san martin pollution 
control director of sao paulo state 
brazilian environmental officials found the residue to contain 
dangerously high levels of lead mercury cadmium and pcbs that 
produquimica was unequipped to handle and the waste was sent back 
san martin said greenpeace blocked a second shipment of 1000 tons 
of tainted zinc residue 
to sidestep controls some foreignowned multinationals ship 
wastes to subsidiaries in latin countries 
in 1978 dioxanes and benzene produced by foreign multinationals 
abroad were buried in earth wells in the samarita district of 
cubatao in southern brazil said wong director of the sao paulo 
center 
housing was built on the well sites several years later and 
dozens of residents suffered blood disorders such as sickle cell 
anemia and leukemia because of the toxins said a report by sao 
paulo state health officials 
in 1989 mexican health officials in ciudad juarez said scores 
of children sniffed glowing toxic waste dumped by a 
maquiladora one of more than 1000 usowned assembly plants 
on the mexican side of the border they said the waste could cause 
infertility genetic damage and organ and brain lesions 
a study of seven border cities by the colegio de la frontera 
norte a mexican think tank said maquiladoras were contaminating 
the water table and contributing to cancer congenital defects and 
nervous system damage 
chile argentina and paraguay are drafting laws to prohibit 
waste imports brazil restricted imports of scrap metal imports on 
aug 1

if ever a man has had his sense of humor put 
to the test its robert polhill 
first hes held hostage by lebanese extremists more than three 
years and being diabetic must find a way to get daily insulin 
from captors who dont speak his language 
then when the former beirut university college lecturer is 
released he learns he has throat cancer and must have his voice 
box removed 
now polhill at 56 is without a job breathing through a hole 
in his neck and trying to get people to understand him through a 
fatiguing process called esophageal speech 
still the oneliners keep coming 
ill talk again he wrote on a yellow pad but im a 
realist too ill never have another hit record 
polhill was taken hostage jan 24 1987 and freed last april 
22 three and a half weeks later doctors at walter reed hospital 
removed his larynx a short time later he and his wife moved into 
a hospital apartment near the speech clinic where he gets therapy 
twice a day 
hes an aplus student said prof william t simpkins jr 
he made a sound the first month after surgery at four months 
hes where many people are at six months 
polhill said that for 39 years including his days as a hostage 
he smoked up to four packs of cigarettes a day more than 90 
percent of the 25000 people who require the surgery were heavy 
smokers simpkins said 
he was always smoking said polhills wife ferial he got 
up in the middle of the night to smoke 
polhill cant smoke anymore because he no longer can breathe 
through his nose and mouth 
he talks by capturing air between his tongue and teeth and 
compressing it to create sounds that and notewriting are the 
ways he answers questions 
laryngectomy patients who perfect this esophageal speech sound 
like normal talkers with headcolds simpkins said 
polhill said he rejected the electronic device preferred by some 
throatcancer victims because you sound like you are trying out 
for star wars 
tall and slim polhill is generally lowkey bantering playfully 
with his wife and cracking jokes with visitors when he tires of 
talking he reaches for his pencil and pad and keeps the 
conversation going in neat precise print 
he bristled only once when he was asked if losing his voice was 
worse than being a hostage 
to me there is no comparison to being chained to the floor 
he said you couldnt even get up to go to the bathroom 
when polhill was released he was quoted as saying he strived 
to continue to be angry as a means of coping with captivity 
later he said he was angry at being a captive but not consumed 
by it 
the point was that anger is a great energizer he said 
then you use humor to tone it down and rechannel it more 
productively 
i guess ive always been able to laugh at myself said 
polhill i didnt have the psychological problems i was expected 
to have 
he said a state department psychiatrist was assigned to him at 
damascus immediately after he was released but by the time they 
reached wiesbaden germany the two men were friends not doctor 
and patient 
they warned me that he would go into a depression ferial 
polhill said but i said i dont think so 
polhills plans for the future are vague a certified public 
accountant he said hes too out of date to step right back into an 
accounting job 
all of my energy to date has been devoted to the return to 
freedom recovery from cancer and learning to talk he said 
his medical bills and living arrangements have been handled by 
the government since his release though he knows uncle sams 
generosity wont go on forever 
id like to write id like to speak and teach again he 
said he also said he would like to help diabetics throat cancer 
patients and hostages and their families 
ferial polhill who is palestinian and fluent in arabic english 
and french is ready to go back to work she and robert met in 
cyprus when she was an office manager at the international 
accounting firm for which he worked an openly affectionate couple 
theyve been married for 10 years 
they will move wherever there is a job opportunity polhill 
said but he would like to stay in the united states 
meanwhile the couples social life has included functions 
arranged by no greater love a nonprofit organizations that helps 
hostages and their families and the american diabetes association 
which published polhills account of how he coped with his diabetes 
as a captive 
in the associations forecast magazine he wrote about how he 
and another diabetic hostage took care of each other and 
communicated their needs to their captors otherwise he declines 
to give extensive details about his 1182 days as a captive 
i have a responsibility to those still there he said 
ive made my recommendations directly to the man who can do 
something i have no public recommendations to make 
he said president bush listened intently and took notes when 
they met shortly after polhill was released 
ferial polhill said if her husband wants to discuss his days as 
a hostage shes there to listen but she doesnt ask questions and 
doesnt feel a need to know the details 
thinking about it doesnt bother me said polhill but 
does the world need to know 
while polhill was a captive ferial stayed on in beirut the 
city where she grew up trying to find her husband she left only 
when fighting became intolerable but returned later and was in 
beirut when robert was released 
she said people have been surprised at how easily the couple has 
adjusted to being together again after the long ordeal 
its as if we were stepping back in time she said we 
fell back into our lives as if nothing had happened 
she said her friends have asked her how her husband hollers at 
her now that he has no voice box 
i say his writing gets very messy she said 
thats whats depressing joked polhill i cant shout at 
her anymore

after 44 months of blindfolds and bonds of 
arsenic and aches former hostage frank reed is trying to find his 
place in the world 
it hasnt been easy jobless and living in a furnished 
apartment homecoming for reed has been pleasure fused with pain 
this fall there have been holidays and birthdays football games 
and homecomings reunions with old friends and a sentimental 
journey into the past to review his life 
but what reed has found since he was freed by his shiite moslem 
kidnappers in lebanon on april 30 is that he is not the same man 
that things are not the same that life is getting shorter 
the healing process takes time he said im trying to 
find out who i am what america is how do i fit into all of these 
things where do i belong where should i live how am i going to 
pay the rent over the rest of my life 
one of the problems about hostaging is you become very 
selfcentered because your major concern is yourself he said 
and i brought that out with me im certainly a hell of a lot 
happier but am i enjoying contentment and happiness no im not 
there yet 
a triplet whose siamesetwin sisters died shortly after birth

trying to complete his reentry into the world 
he has launched a movement he calls hostagepeace to work for 
the release of 13 westerners still held in lebanon most of them 
are believed in the hands of shiite factions belonging to the 
iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
reed calls them our boys distinguishing his generation of 
hostages from new ones held by iraq after its invasion of kuwait 
last august he has taken his movement to college campuses across 
the country on a lecture circuit that has been providing his only 
income 
he talks often of friends left behind among them six americans 
including terry anderson 43 chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press and thomas sutherland 59 acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut they are in their 
sixth year of captivity the longestheld hostages

husband who stepped out of captivity is not the giving kind man

lebanese international school he founded and directed he became a 
moslem before marrying her

of starting anew

boston insurance firm helps support the family she and son tarek 
lived in an apartment with reeds mother leota sprague during the 
last year of her husbands captivity

ive left behind is the school the income and the property that i 
owned 
mrs reed said they are struggling financially every now and 
then i have to resort to my parents as usual she said but it 
is a struggle

wife said hes negotiating for a book and a movie and hopes to 
complete his phd in education at boston college he is healthy

the bankruptcy court filing by continental 
airlines leaves an empire built by ousted chairman frank lorenzo in 
disarray but the carrier says it will continue flying while it 
tries to reorganize 
the nations fifthlargest airline blamed 22 billion in debt 
and increased jet fuel costs due to the persian gulf crisis for 
mondays decision to seek protection from creditors under chapter 
11 of federal bankruptcy laws 
continental said the move did not affect any of about 1400 
flights monday the airline serves 88 us cities and 55 
international destinations with more than 300 planes its main hubs 
are in newark nj houston and denver and the airline is 
building up a fourth hub in cleveland 
management sought to reassure the airlines passengers and 
37000 employees the carrier planned to emerge from bankruptcy 
court as an operating entity the airline would fly its normal 
schedule and honor contracts with travel agents and other airlines 
we are confident that there will be no need for layoffs pay 
cuts or reductions in benefits said hollis harris chairman of 
continental airlines holdings inc the airlines parent which 
also filed for chapter 11 
the move though leaves in tatters an empire crafted by lorenzo 
from a hodgepodge of carriers including eastern airlines people 
express and frontier and its huge debt is a legacy of its growth 
during the 1980s 
subsidiary eastern is struggling as it seeks to reorganize after 
filing for bankruptcy protection in 1989 lorenzo was ousted as 
chairman earlier this year and his texas air corp was renamed 
the trip to bankruptcy court was the second in seven years by 
continental which filed in 1983 amid a bitter labor dispute with 
the airlines union under chapter 11 a company gets a reprieve 
from debts while it figures out how to pay bills and tries to 
reorganize as a healthy business 
this is not a bankruptcy as was continentals in 1983 or 
easterns last year continentals general counsel charles t 
goolsbee said remember those airlines shut down we are 
doing none of that this is absolutely a businessasusual 
program 
some analysts said continental may have a relatively smooth ride 
through bankruptcy court but recent shakeouts in the industry and 
the uncertainty of the middle east situation remain troubling 
its still a strong airline said raymond neidl an analyst 
with dillon read amp co a wall street investment firm theyve 
got good hubs and fairly cheap operating costs they want to hold 
onto most of these assets in the long term that could be good 
continental said it had agreed to sell its seattletacoma to 
tokyo route to american airlines for 150 million pending 
bankruptcy court approval the route sale is to be concluded at the 
end of 1991 but 140 million of the sale price is expected to be 
advanced to continental before the deal closes 
as part of the sale continental withdrew its other 
international routes from the market last month continental put 
those up for sale instead of seeking bankruptcy protection 
continental has about 22 billion in outstanding debt about 
17 billion of which is secured it also has nearly 4 billion in 
aircraft operating losses 
harris said the airline is spending an extra 70 million a month 
on jet fuel because of a sharp rise since iraq invaded kuwait in 
august prices more than doubled from about 57 cents in july to 
128 in midoctober before falling back in recent weeks 
continental now is paying 107 per gallon in addition the 
airline has increased passenger fares 15 percent in recent months 
but spokesman ned walker said the hikes come nowhere near to 
recovering our fuel costs 
continental lost 883 million in the third quarter of this 
year compared to a loss of 158 million in 1989 for the first 
nine months losses totaled 97 million compared with 523 million 
in the same period a year ago 
rising jet fuel costs have affected other airlines but none had 
filed for chapter 11 before continental 
earlier this fall pan am corp announced it would sell five 
prized london routes to ual corp the parent of united in a 400 
million deal in addition airlines have laid of thousands of 
workers and some plan to cut capacities

not everyone views this weeks trade 
talks as a key to economic prosperity some third world activists 
see them fostering more hunger foreign economic dominance and 
pressure for lucrative drug cultivation 
the focus at the main conference center here was a brewing 
crisis over foreign agriculture subsidies that threatened the 
general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt talks on reforming 
the rules of the world trading system 
in an adjacent hotel a diverse collection of environmentalists 
leftists workers for nongovernmental organizations activists and 
others labeled the negotiations a gattastrophe 
gatt will have very grave consequences on the environment 
said belgian researcher myrian vander stichele reporting the 
conclusion of a weeklong alternative conference of civil 
associations for development 
gatt doesnt deal with development or issues that matter to 
people in the third world she told a news conference 
diplomats and trade ministers from nearly 100 countries 
including many in the third world at the gatt talks say new rules 
to expand world trade will benefit people in developing countries 
as well as prosperous nations 
the main roadblock at the talks was a us demand that the 
european community and japan stop heavy subsidies of agriculture 
and permit breakthroughs in regulating new areas the talks opened 
monday 
panelists from nongovernmental organizations in the 
philippines peru senegal and japan at the alternative conference 
said the end of argiculture subsidies would have dire effects in 
some nations 
if the united states wants to combat drugs third world 
farmers shouldnt be stopping production of normal crops said 
manuel lajo a peruvian economist 
lajo said developing nations fear the end of farm subsidies in 
wealthy nations will distort farm activity in poorer countries and 
may lead to more cultivation of coca the raw material for cocaine 
the relation between coca production and farm prices is very 
strong lajo said 
amadou kanoute of senegal challenged the gatt aim of extending 
freetrade rules to agriculture food security is an elemental 
right of each nation he said 
kanoute who was in brussels as a representative of 
environmental development action in the third world said 25 
percent of people in senegal suffer malnutrition and changing gatt 
rules will not help develop small farmers 
teresita oliveros of manila representing interests of peasant 
women in the philippines said international trade rules were 
unbalanced in favor of rich countries and powerful transnational 
companies 
powerful nations are imposing their rules on us especially 
the united states and japan she said 
in her ironic description of the rules americans and filipinos 
have equal rights to go to each others country and exploit 
resources but only americans are able to do so 
in the game of wealthy and powerful nations the poor farmers 
peasants and fisherfolk are sent to the margins ms oliveros 
said 
mika eba of japan represented a range of consumer farming and 
environmental groups she said the us demand to open japans 
closed rice market would damage the japanese environment and 
backfire on washington because japanese probably would buy cheaper 
rice from thailand not american rice 
humberto campodonica sanchez a teacher at san marcos university 
in lima peru said the gatt goal of extending freetrade rules to 
services will harm infant industries in developing countries 
for instance he said if a french bank was blocked from 
expanding in bolivia paris could threaten to block exports of tin 
and wool that are bolivias lifeline its like a lion playing 
with an ant campodonica said 
he also attacked a plan to ban developing countries from 
imposing conditions on foreign investments such as requiring a 
certain percentage of local parts or foreign exchange limits 
the plan does not account for advantages foreign companies 
receive in lowerpaid workers in the third world campodonica said

the success of continental airlines decision to 
file for bankruptcy court protection might depend on how long tough 
times linger in an industry ravaged by high fuel costs and a 
sinking economy analysts say 
passengers should see no changes in continentals service as the 
houstonbased carrier buys time and holds creditors at bay for 
now anyway but analysts said the strategy depends on outside 
factors changing 
theyre trying to hold the thing together as much as possible 
and try to wait it out said thomas canning at standard amp poors 
corp a leading debtrating agency it could work provided this 
recession is not too prolonged and too deep 
if on the other hand continental and other weak airlines 
continue bleeding and even go out of business financially powerful 
airlines such as american and united will be in a much better 
position that could mean for example fewer fare discounts and 
even some big fare increases as competition declines 
even as continental announced the chapter 11 filing monday it 
said it was selling a prized seattletokyo route to american for 
150 million the move seemed to affirm the view of analysts who 
have said the persian gulf crisis is serving as a catalyst to speed 
industry shakeups 
the bankruptcy filing appeared to have been necessary because 
of a liquidity crisis where assets could not be sold in a good time 
frame said raymond neidl an analyst with dillon read amp co 
the other major airline in bankruptcy court is eastern a 
continental subsidiary it ran into lifethreatening troubles this 
fall when unsecured creditors asked a bankruptcy judge to order a 
liquidation saying eastern has no chance of a healthy recovery 
but last week easterns courtappointed trustee martin r 
shugrue jr persuaded a bankruptcy judge to give eastern up to 135 
million from an escrow fund shugrue said the cash will keep 
eastern alive through march and after that he believes the airline 
can stop losing money 
analysts dont believe it will be that simple but they say 
easterns experience shows that an airline can stay alive in 
bankruptcy court indefinitely 
as weve seen them with the eastern bankruptcy the airline 
under the protection of chapter 11 can continue as a very 
effective competitor said bruce thorp airline analyst with 
provident national bank in philadelphia 
in fact easterns presence is very much felt by competitors 
such as delta he said the important point here is going into 
chapter 11 does not take you out of business by any means 
still the uncertainties posed by the persian gulf crisis and 
the slow economy will remain big obstacles 
airlines have all been hit hard by the jump in jet fuel prices 
that came after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 throwing world oil 
markets into chaos 
coupled with sluggish demand for air travel the airline 
industry has been limping toward its worst year ever with losses 
estimated at more than 1 billion 
seeral weeks ago continental had considered the bankruptcy 
option but it decided at the time to try and avoid it apparently 
the carrier was unable to make any other options work for the 
immediate future analysts said 
i dont see chapter 11 as any panacea thorp said i think 
it holds creditors at bay its a buying of time more than 
anything

nov 15 and that the two companies held talks on the offer since 
though atampt described its bid as friendly exley said atampts 
decision to disclose the talks made the 90ashare proposal 
hostile 
if this is their idea of a friendly takeover they must look 
like attila the hun when theyre feeling unfriendly he said at a 
news conference at ncr headquarters in dayton ohio 
atampts decision to make the discussions public puts pressure on 
ncr by letting ncr shareholders know of the deal the 90ashare 
bid represents a 60 percent premium over ncrs stock price friday 
ncr shares shot up 2475 to close at 8150 monday as 5 million 
shares changed hands on the new york stock exchange making it the 
second most actively traded issue behind atampt atampt fell 2 a share 
to 3012 with 85 million shares traded atampt is the nations 
most widely held stock 
atampt said its offer remained open until the end of business 
wednesday if ncr does not accept by then atampt may make a tender 
offer directly to ncr stockholders atampt chairman robert e allen 
said 
several industry analysts viewed atampts talk of a tender offer 
as a tactic to get ncr to agree to a negotiated deal rick martin 
of prudentialbache securities inc said ncr had several options if 
it chose to fight atampts bid all costly 
one would be a leveraged buyout in which ncr would borrow money 
to buy back its shares and go private a second would be to buy 
another computer company to make itself less attractive martin 
said 
ncr also could seek a white knight a third company that 
would buy ncr to save it from atampt but martin said it would be 
difficult to find a better suitor than atampt in the computer 
industry 
exley said in the interview that ncr was exploring all the 
available alternatives to fight an atampt takeover he also said 
the company was contacted by other potential suitors since rumors 
of an atampt bid appeared in the press early last month 
we made no response to any of them he said were not 
interested in being acquired by anybody 
in a strongly worded letter monday to allen released by ncr 
exley said atampt had resorted to the pressure takeover tactics of 
the 1980s actions more suited to a corporate raider than a 
responsible corporate citizen 
he said atampt had exaggerated the length and nature of the 
companies conversations and had damaged the market value of both 
companies he said mondays stock activity had erased 2 billion 
from atampts market value while adding 16 billion to ncrs 
in a letter last week released by atampt exley said ncr would be 
willing to discuss a merger if the price were raised to a level 
that reflects the substantial prospects of ncrs business plan 
the strategic importance of ncr to atampts future and the value of 
avoiding a disruptive takeover battle 
allen said he believed the letter reflected the legal duty of 
ncrs directors to consider such offers he said he had no plans to 
increase atampts bid unless ncr provided documents that would 
justify it 
allen said atampt decided to make its offer public sunday after 
ncr refused to negotiate over the weekend as a followup to exleys 
letter 
but exley said the company refused to provide confidential 
information because atampt would not sign an agreement to postpone 
further action on a takeover as is typical in corporate mergers

when american telephone amp telegraph co was 
granted the right to enter the computer business as part of the 
1984 breakup of the bell system some predicted the phone giant 
would become a computer colossus to rival ibm 
it didnt happen 
atampt has barely made a mark in the computer industry its 
computer sales ranked about 17th in the world last year far 
behind no 1 international business machines corp according to 
prudentialbache securities inc 
atampt has lost an estimated 2 billion to 3 billion trying to 
make a name for itself in the increasingly competitive computer 
market analysts say that until recently its strategy had been 
muddled and its products mediocre 
we were on the right track atampt chairman robert e allen 
said monday we were moving positively and having more successs 
but we were not going to achieve the critical mass of customers 
alone 
gregory sawers an industry analyst at the investment firm 
sanford c bernstein amp co agreed 
theyve tried for six years now it simply hasnt worked they 
dont have the critical mass they dont have the productline 
breadth they dont have the distribution facilities he said 
that realization prompted atampts effort to buy ncr corp the 
nations fifthlargest computer maker in a 6 billion offer 
announced sunday ncr is resisting 
allen said ncr and atampts data systems group would make a good 
match both are committed to open computing systems machines 
that follow industry standards and can easily work with computers 
made by other companies 
both also use the popular unix operating system invented by 
atampt an operating system is the base layer of software that 
controls a computers internal functions 
rick martin a computer analyst at prudentialbache securities 
inc said ncr would make a good mate for atampt these two 
companies have virtually the same strategy and the same products 
he said 
though atampts computer business has not met expectations it has 
improved sales in recent years by focusing on selling 
networked or connected computer systems and by striking 
alliances with other computer makers 
atampt owns almost 20 percent of sun microsystems inc the 
topselling maker of computer workstations last year it bought 
istel group ltd a british computer company for 290 million 
atampt earlier held a 22 percent stake in olivetti the italian 
computer and officeequipment maker but traded it last year for a 
stake in olivettis parent company olivetti made personal 
computers for atampt but atampt ended the deal after sales were 
disapppointing 
but the ncr bid would be atampts biggest deal yet through it 
atampt would gain ncrs customer base as well as its highly regarded 
line of computers 
in september ncr announced a bold strategy to replace its 
entire computer line from closetsize mainframes to desktop 
machines with industrystandard models built on the same intel 
corp computer chip 
atampt said its expertise in communications would meld well with 
ncrs computer sales in the retail and banking fields which rely 
on instantaneous transactions over phone lines and computer 
networks 
atampt had been believed to be looking for a major computer 
acquistion for some time with both unisys corp and digital 
equipment corp mentioned as contenders but atampt may view the 
smaller ncr as an easier target 
the biggestever computer industry merger was burroughs corps 
48 billion takeover of sperry corp in 1986 that formed unisys 
while the merger initially resulted in higher profits unisys has 
run into trouble in recent years

a proposed merger between atampt and ncr corp 
comes at a time when ncr is at the zenith of its transformation 
from a maker of lowtech cash registers to a leading producer of 
innovative computer systems 
ncr chairman charles e exley jr said monday his company 
opposes american telephone amp telegraph cos offer to buy ncr for 
6 billion because it would distract ncr from its plans to market a 
new line of computers in the 1990s 
ncr was founded in 1884 when john henry patterson bought the 
national manufacturing co and renamed it national cash register 
the company nearly cornered the market in cash registers creating 
thousands of jobs for the daytonarea economy 
the company also developed a communityminded image during a 
major flood in 1913 ncr workers turned out boats made from 
packingcrate lumber to rescue stranded citizens and during the 
depression of the 1930s ncr set up a relief kitchen for stricken 
residents 
if the independence of ncr is snuffed out it will have some 
impact on the community exley said 
during world war ii ncr made motors for antiaircraft rockets 
and other defense contracts with materials scarce for civilian 
production the company found a booming market in reconditioning 
old cash registers 
by 1960 the market for mechanical cash registers hit its peak 
and the dayton ncr complex boasted 33 buildings on 55 acres but 
the company was hit with high costs and labor strife in the early 
1970s and the production of electromechanical cash registers 
ended in dayton with the loss of 16000 jobs 
the company then stepped up production of electronic cash 
registers and started to lean more heavily on its line of business 
computers which it began developing in the 1950s 
last september ncr announced it would replace its entire 
computer line with industrystandard machines that could 
communicate easily with each other the company said it would 
produce the entire line from tiny laptop models to powerful 
mainframes using the same intel corp microprocessors 
the move was the boldest yet by a traditional computer maker to 
contend with the industrys move to open systems or those that 
follow industry standards so they easily can be connected 
analysts said the new line of machines could strengthen ncrs 
position in the computer industry the company is the nations 
fifthlargest computer maker 
exley said a merger with atampt doesnt make any business sense 
for ncr 
we think it would be a distraction from the great opportunity 
that we have for the product programs that have been announced over 
the last couple of months he said 
and exley said ncr employees are concerned about the offer 
it brings an entirely new element into the scene that our 
people havent confronted before he said 
ncr employs 56000 workers at its 1200 offices around the 
world including about 5400 at its dayton headquarters

japanese demand for golf hawaiis sunny climate 
and a limited supply of land for housing have political leaders 
here asking for up to 100 million as par for the course 
the idea to charge golf course developers community impact 
fees to pay for rental housing has drawn support of gov john 
waihee and honolulu mayor frank fasi 
supporters call it a way to force developers who stand to make 
huge profits exploiting hawaiis limited land to give something 
back to the community critics say its a tempting but legally 
questionable scheme to tax developers under the guise of state and 
county landuse regulations 
with about 50 golf courses being proposed statewide by various 
developers many of them japanese proceeds to the local 
government under the plan could climb well into the billions of 
dollars some developers are ready to pay 
jurigi co of japan agreed to pay honolulu 111 million for a 
justcompleted 40 million municipal golf course near pearl harbor 
and 200 million more in community impact fees for permission to 
build two more courses on oahu where honolulu is located 
the city council rejected the proposal but its chairman arnold 
morgado agrees with the concept 
in september morgado the governor and the mayor said golf 
courses take up land that could be used for housing and require 
large tracts of undeveloped land at or near locations which have 
scenic recreational or cultural significance to the community 
fasi said the fees would be subject to negotiation 
hawaiis leaders are trying to cash in on highpriced 
memberships in hawaii golf courses being peddled in japan 
for instance shinwa golf corp owner of the wailea resort on 
the island of maui has offered japanese citizens 1000 memberships 
at 115000 each in a new wailea golf course 
university of hawaii professor david callies an expert on 
landuse law said impact fees have been found unconstitutional 
when they exceed a developments actual effect on such things as 
roads sewers and the environment 
impact fees are not revenueraising tools and golf courses are 
appropriate open space uses in the right places callies said 
it is difficult to see how a golf course generates 100 
million in infrastructure costs which is the sole legal basis for 
charging such a fee he said 
dan davidson executive director of the land use research 
foundation a research and trade organization for landowners and 
developers said impact fees are tempting from a fiscal standpoint 
it is however a tax and the city has no authority to impose 
this sort of tax in the guise of a landuse regulation he said 
harold masumoto director of the states planning office said 
hawaii could avoid the potential problem of linking golf course 
fees to actual impacts by entering into development agreements 
that way it would not be an impact fee but a mutual agreement 
by the developer to make a contribution to a rental housing fund 
he said 
in 1988 the state land use commission decided that major 
developers had to make 60 percent of their homes affordable for 
low and middleincome families 
in august the same group for the first time imposed the 
governors new policy of requiring hotel and resort developers to 
create one nontourism job for every hotel room they build or pay 
the state 25000 per room 
wali osman director of research for the real estate firm monroe 
amp friedlander inc said the trend is a result of the states 
frustration in handling housing problems and diversifying the 
economy through traditional means he said exactions from 
developers wont solve the housing problems 
the state is going ahead anyway 
last month the board of land and natural resources proposed 
that minami group usa pay 15 million in impact fees in exchange 
for extending a permit to complete a 100 million golf course on 
land zoned for conservation use the extension was needed because 
rain had delayed construction 
an attorney for minami told the board he doubted the legality of 
the new proposed assessments but said his client wanted to be a 
responsible neighbor and was willing to work with the state and 
local groups

lockheed corps board rejected a 16 
billion takeover offer from texas investor harold simmons saying 
the buyout proposal would burden the company with too much debt 
lockheed chairman dan tellep informed simmons of the boards 
decision in a letter monday in which he called the proposal 
highly risky 
simmons lockheeds single largest shareholder with 198 percent 
of the stock had proposed turning lockheed into a private company 
he lost a battle to take control of lockheeds board last march 
but won concessions from the aerospace company 
among them was a promise from tellep to appoint up to three new 
directors to the board lockheed announced four appointments monday 
all approved by big shareholders other than simmons tellep said 
the appointments increased the size of the board to 18 
i think we have more than fulfilled the commitment we made at 
last years annual meeting tellep said monday in a telephone 
interview 
simmons chief strategist j landis martin criticized the 
company for not conferring with simmons on the new board members 
how about the 20 percent shareholder martin said in a 
telephone interview he didnt come to the 20 percent shareholder 
on any of these people 
through his nl industries simmons had offered 40 a share for 
the lockheed stock he doesnt already own he said he would put up 
400 million in cash and 400 million in his own assets but wanted 
t use 800 million of lockheeds assets to finance the rest 
aerospace analyst lawrence harris with bateman eichler hill 
richards inc in los angeles values lockheed at 55 per share he 
said the proposal appeared to be merely preparation for a second 
proxy war for control of lockheed 
the next annual meeting is not that far off so this is one 
way nl can be on record as saying we attempted to get 40 for the 
shareholders harris said 
asked if another fight for the board was likely martin said 
were going to consider our options which would include that 
lockheeds 13 billion in debt would have to be refinanced if 
the board went along with simmons plan that plus the new 800 
million in debt would have to be borrowed at a time when loans 
from any source are hard to come by 
simmons maintains the additional debt could be taken on because 
lockheed could stop paying an estimated 113 million in annual 
dividends after accounting for taxes that would yield the 
equivalent of 165 million per year martin said 
tellep said that was not enough to justify loading lockheed with 
21 billion in debt 
the new directors are robert g kirby 65 board chairman of 
capital guardian trust in los angeles frank savage 52 senior 
vice president of the equitable life assurance socety of the united 
states retired adm carlisle ah trost 60 former chief of naval 
operations and douglas c yearley 54 chairman and chief 
executive of phelps dodge corp in phoenix

prosecutors scoffed at the claims of soybean 
traders on trial for fraud that they violated chicago board of 
trade rules to benefit their customers 
closing arguments began monday in the trial of 10 traders 
fingered in a federal probe of corruption at the bot and the 
chicago mercantile exchange in all 48 people were indicted after 
fbi agents posed as traders and secretly taperecorded 
conversations 
defense attorneys presented testimony and evidence during the 
threemonth trial intended to show that unauthorized trading 
outside the pit was common and necessary to satisfy customers and 
large brokerage houses 
the prosecutions closing arguments were scheduled to conclude 
today the defense will then begin its summary which is expected 
to continue through thursday 
monday assistant us attorney mark rotert urged the jury to 
disregard testimony from traders claiming that the exchanges rules 
were outdated 
thats a defense rotert asked well i dont think it 
is 
the board of trade allows grain producers and handlers to lock 
in prices and pass the risk on to speculators who accept that risk 
and try to make money from it rotert said 
they took that premise and perverted it rotert said 
their risk was passed back the risk was passed on to the next 
customer 
rotert said soybean traders should have the same responsibility 
to treat clients fairly and honestly as lawyers and doctors have 
the customer has every legitimate right to believe and trust 
that the rules of the chicago board of trade are being followed 
he said 
lawyers are appropriately governed by rules he said 
doctors hold peoples lives in their hands and they are governed 
by rules commodities traders hold peoples money in their hands 
and they also should be governed by rules 
us district judge george marovich presided over the jury trial 
of the traders charged with conspiring to defraud customers 
through illegal trading practices 
on trial are martin j dempsey charles w bergstrom bradley 
ashman william a barcal iii edward a cox thomas p kenney 
john ryan joel j fetchenhier sheldon schneider and john a 
vercillo 
they face scores of charges including racketeering mail fraud 
and wire fraud 
rotert said the traders deliberately violated the board of 
trades rules prohibiting trading outside the openoutcry system 
and the boards operating hours 
in the open outcry system traders crowd into designated trading 
pits where they buy and sell contracts for future deliveries of 
commodities through a combination of hand signals and shouted buy 
and sellorders 
the defendants are accused of conducting trades outside of the 
openoutcry system of the board of trade profits from those trades 
were used to make up any money traders cost customers while making 
a mistake the prosecution said the exchanges rules state the 
trader must personally make up the difference in the event of a 
mistake 
these men intended to get money from customers under false 
pretenses rotert said they think things like ethics fairness 
and the law are a matter of context

a businessman with ties to the irancontra 
affair has been sentenced to two years probation for his role in a 
conspiracy to sell confidential ashland oil inc documents to iran 
us district judge miriam g cedarbaum on monday also ordered 
roy m furmark a private consultant in the oil industry to pay 
ashland 15000 in restitution 
furmark pleaded guilty in march to one count of conspiracy to 
commit wire fraud 
furmark of brooklyn testified to congress in 1987 that he was 
involved in the sale of american arms to iran 
in the ashland case furmark cooperated with prosecutors for 
more than a year before his plea and helped implicate former 
ashland chairman orin e atkins in the conspiracy 
on friday atkins who also pleaded guilty to conspiracy was 
sentenced to two years probation and 600 hours of community service 
for his role in the scheme 
furmark admitted that he agreed to help atkins arrange meetings 
with representatives of the iranian national oil co which was 
contemplating a lawsuit against ashland for the companys decision 
not to pay 283 million for crude oil purchased in 1979 
atkins has said he wanted to sell to the iranians confidential 
documents involving the disputed oil deal that he obtained after he 
was forced to resign as chairman in 1981 but remained as a paid 
ashland consultant 
while the iranians never bought the documents they later sued 
ashland and last year obtained a 325 million settlement which 
with interest was worth more than 500 million 
this episode in my life has been totally uncharacteristic to 
my life and what i stand for furmark told cedarbaum i am 
deeply sorry 
cedarbaum said she considered furmarks cooperation in deciding 
his sentence furmark set up a meeting with atkins in 1988 where 
they discussed renewed efforts to sell the documents iran a 
videotape of that meeting made by investigators led to charges 
against atkins

saturn corp has produced lerss than 2200 saturn 
cars at its tennessee plant since retail production began this 
summer and dealers are feeling the pinch 
some dealers say they have only one or two cars to show off to 
prospective customers 
saturn officials had said they expected to build about 17000 
cars by the end of the year but now say they wont meet the 
target 
spokeswoman jennifer schettler said monday that just 2162 
saturn cars have been built at the companys spring hill tenn 
plant since retail production began in the summer 
she and other saturn officials said the company has a rigid 
quality control system at the plant which has resulted in 
lowerthanexpected shipments to dealers 
the company is a 3 billion project set up as a subsidiary of 
general motors corp 
there are 52 saturn dealers open in the united states up from 
29 when the line of small cars went on sale oct 25 
we opened our doors thursday evening but aside from a display 
model on loan from saturn i dont have any cars said karen 
tibus president of saturn of plymouth about 15 miles west of 
detroit i can tough it out for a while but it gets expensive 
when you have a payroll to meet and the utility meters are 
running 
she said she wanted to open with an 18person staff but that 
was cut to nine 
jeremy anwyl an automotive marketing consultant in irvine 
calif said the situation would be worse if saturn had released to 
dealers cars with quality problems 
youre better off being uncomfortable for two or three months 
than ending up with a 3 billion turkey that you eventually have to 
kill he said

a senior egyptian oil official tuesday ruled 
out the possibility that iraq might be expelled from an arab 
petroleum organization as punishment for invading kuwait 
mohammed shawkat adviser to oil minister abdelhady kandil 
said there is no plan for oil ministers of the organization of arab 
petroleum exporting countries even to discuss the idea at their 
meeting saturday in cairo 
to begin with this is not on the agenda said shawkat who 
will be the conference spokesan 
moreover its a political issue and oapecs charter excludes 
politics the organization has economic objectives involving 
cooperation and policy coordination among its members 
shawkat was commenting on speculation that kuwait or other 
members of the 10country group would suggest to the ministers that 
iraq be expelled there also have been reports that the ministers 
would consider moving the organizations headquarters from kuwait 
which iraq annexed on aug 8 six days after the invasion 
such a suggestion might come before the ministers shawkat said 
iraq might want it moved to baghdad to dramatize its assertion of 
sovereignty over kuwait or another member may propose temporarily 
relocating oapecs headquarters because of its inability to 
function under iraqi occupation 
again this is not on the agenda but someone may suggest it 
under the customary agenda item of other business he said in an 
interview 
but he indicated that egypt the meetings chairman would 
contest it as a double violation of the charter the suggestion at 
least if proposed by iraq would be political and the charter 
specifies kuwait as the organizations home 
saudi arabia kuwait and libya founded oapec in 1968 partly to 
stimulate investment by member countries in each others oil 
industries in addition to the founders it now includes egypt 
iraq qatar bahrain the united arab emirates syria and algeria 
shawkat said the agenda of the cairo meeting includes a joint 
project for building a drydock in algeria a plan to develop an 
oapec training institute in baghdad and the groups 1991 budget he 
refused to disclose the proposed budget estimates 
iraq has not notified egypt as the organizer whether its oil 
minister will participate shawkat said if he does not come iraq 
will be represented by its cairo ambassador nabil najm 
iraqi president saddam hussein last month named his soninlaw 
hussein kamel hassan acting oil minister after firing issam 
alchalabi from the oil portfolio

gordon becker never stops thinking about 
christmas 
as president and founder of becker group the nations largest 
retail decorator visions of sugar plums dance round his head all 
year as he concocts ways to turn ubiquitous shopping centers and 
malls into customerluring winter wonderlands 
the companys creations go beyond strings of lights and plywood 
reindeer there are castles and christmas trees as tall as office 
buildings there are scenes of disney characters sesame street 
creatures peanuts rudolph the rednose reindeer and garfield the 
cat 
becker group installed new displays in 145 shopping centers and 
malls this year at an average cost of 100000 apiece the 
companys clientele though totals 350 malls and centers 
nationwide 
becker said revenue for the privatly owned company is expected 
to exceed 13 million in 1990 with the christmas decorations 
accounting for nearly 95 percent of business 
its a fun business but there are nervewracking moments 
said the slightly rotund 57yearold becker a former store santa 
beckers busiest time is the two months before christmas when 
the company ships and assembles its christmas creations throughout 
the year hes taking orders making plans and surveying malls and 
stores 
business wasnt always so brisk however 
becker said he was forced to file for bankruptcy protection 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws in 1976 although 
he managed to stay in business he struggled until 1983 when 
things finally started to take off 
it was that year when becker began targeting developers who own 
groups of malls those contracts now comprise 60 percent of his 
business 
i was meeting with a developer in dallas in 1983 and he told 
me i might have a good year he had 12 malls and he was thinking 
about giving me five or six becker said i said why not all 
12 i came back with almost a million dollar order 
revenue immediately jumped from 3 million where it had been 
mired for several years to 47 million 
today beckers company decorates malls for 13 developers 
including taubman co which owns 22 shopping centers and the 
edward j debartolo corp which owns 17 shopping centers the san 
francisco 49ers and the pittsburgh penguins hockey team 
among his clients the northwest plaza in st louis mo 
recently paid becker 400000 for a giant santa castle complete 
with 50foot banners strung through 10foot high wreaths the owner 
of the mall is the new yorkbased development company paramount 
group inc which owns three other malls in the united states all 
are clients of becker 
we probably do the largest santa photo concession because its 
so breathtaking people will drive from miles around to get their 
picture taken in our santa castle rather than somewhere else 
said christi parks marketing director for northwest plaza 
theres absolutely no doubt its worth the money we spent on 
it she said our mall has always had a reputation for having 
special christmas decorations for us to do something every few 
feet was not acceptable we literally need to fill the mall with 
christmas 
fair lane and twelve oaks shopping centers in detroit spent more 
than 350000 each on becker holiday decorations at cherry creek 
mall in denver becker provided a 52foot high christmas tree that 
measures 28 feet in diameter 
the cranberry mall in westminster md paid 50000 for its 
help garfield find pooky display several garfield figures 
powered by compressed air pop up in a house as the fat orange 
cartoon cat searches for his favorite stuffed animal 
most of becker groups decorations fall in the traditional line 
and the more elaborate fifth avenue line becker said 
displays last about three years meaning one third of the 
companys customers purchase new decorations every year 
beckers passion for christmas began in high school when he 
worked as a store santa for some pocket money for the holidays 
after he graduated from the university of maryland he started a 
santa school and rental business 
the school was abandoned in the early 1960s as he became more 
involved in the decorating business 
when it started 35 years ago my office was my bedroom in my 
mothers house and the garage was a warehouse said becker who 
operates today out of a 19th century townhouse in a fashionable 
neighborhood in baltimore the firm employs more thn 100 people 
in the 1950s you have to remember shopping centers were new 
there were no companies that existed you had to really juryrig 
everything recalled becker 
in the beginning he said he would do anything for a client and 
became known for setting up spotlights in front of stores 
becker said a background in show business helped his father 
lou becker was a bandleader who worked with tommy and jimmy 
dorsey 
its theater in its purest form he said the way we deal 
with people there are the same technical problems as in mounting a 
show 
it has to look like the empire state building but when its 
over two guys have to be able to pack it up and put it away

british airways said tuesday it is seeking to 
create a new berlinbased airline which would compete with the 
german carrier lufthansa 
such an airline which aims to turn berlin into a hub could 
expand greatly in coming years by providing eastwest european air 
services and feeding into longhaul transcontinental flights 
british airways would hold a 49 percent stake in the new 
carrier and unspecified german investors would own the rest said 
a british airways spokeswoman who wasnt identified in accordance 
with airline practice 
we are still talking to a number of german interests its not 
going to be an immediate announcement its very much at the 
planning stages she said 
the new airline as yet unnamed isnt expected to begin 
operating until 1993 
british airways is advertising in the trade press for pilots in 
preparation for the airlines creation the spokeswoman said 
the carrier has been spurred to seek such a deal by german 
unification which effectively forces foreign carriers out of 
germany by 1993 
british airways currently operates a berlinbased fleet of nine 
airplanes providing 86 daily flights to nine german cities 
were keen to continue to operate in berlin weve been in 
there for 44 years we want to continue and expand it the 
spokeswoman said 
british airways has served berlin since world war ii when it 
flew in supplies as part of the airlifts through which the allied 
forces replenished the blockaded city 
after the berlin wall came down pan american world airways the 
primary provider of berlin air services sold its operations to 
lufthansa which had been prohibited from operating out of berlins 
tegl airport since the war 
british airways which has transformed itself from a poor 
airline into a world class carrier since its 1987 privatization 
has been expanding its european operations 
it recently announced plans to create a new moscowbased airline 
called air russia which the british airline wants to operate 
jointly with the stateowned soviet carrier aeroflot 
it also is seeking to turn the governmentowned belgian airline 
sabena into a carrier jointly owned by british airways klm royal 
dutch airways and sabena that deal which aims to make brussels 
another hub awaits regulatory approval from the european 
commission

talks to revamp the world free trading 
system are very close to collapse a us trade official said 
today 
ambassador rufus yerxa a deputy us trade representative told 
a news conference the european community had not responded to 
demands from most other countries for greater liberalization on 
farm trade 
its quite clear the ball is now in the communitys court 
he said 
yerxa asked about australian trade minister neal blewetts 
statement that something had to give by the days end replied 
it is safe to say we share the concern of minister blewett of 
australia that these negotiations are very close to collapse 
president bush in uruguay the birthplace of the socalled 
uruguay round talks expressed hope that the negotiations might yet 
succeed 
we must use this meeting to find the political will to limit 
or reduce distortions in trade bush said 
yerxa said it was highly unlikely there would be further 
negotiations unless the ec changed its position no talks on the 
key farm trade question were scheduled 
as he spoke ec trade ministers were gathering to discuss their 
position in talks under the general agreement on tariffs and trade 
a treaty pledging its members to free trade 
despite pressure from many sides on the europeans for deep cuts 
in the ecs costly farm support programs community officials 
showed no willingness to make new reductions in their agriculture 
offer at the 107nation uruguay round the most ambitious trade 
talks ever 
there is absolutely no hope of having an agreement this 
afternoon or even tomorrow afternoon but possibly by friday 
said ray macsharry the farm chief of the 12nation trading bloc 
officials are locked in a makeorbreak effort to overhaul the 
global trading system by weeks end 
the comprehensive agreement they are seeking would lower trade 
barriers and write new rules covering trade in 15 areas including 
agriculture manufactured goods textiles trademarks and patents 
and services such as banking and telecommunications 
the uruguay round bargaining which opened in 1986 in the 
uruguayan resort of punta del este has broken down in recent 
months because of a stubborn fight between the european community 
and its major trading partners over government payments to farmers 
the united states backed by argentina australia and other 
nations has demanded so far without results that the european 
community peel away much of the support program for its 10 million 
farmers 
there appeared to be growing anger over the communitys refusal 
to budge on agriculture which a number of nations including the 
united states australia and argentina have said is key to an 
overall deal 
the ec has offered to trim only 30 percent in subsidies for 
major crops over a 10year period counting from 1986 the united 
states is urging it to slash subsidies by 75 percent to 90 percent 
over the next decade 
canadian state minister charles mayer dismissed the communitys 
offer as mumbo jumbo and said in our country someone who 
comes around selling snake oil we call him a quack 
many european farmers view the subsidy cuts as threatening their 
livelihood police fired tear gas and water cannons monday to 
disperse 30000 farmers outside the european parliament building in 
the belgian capital 
the united states believes that without a commitment to reduce 
farm subsidies third world countries will walk away from the 
negotiations dooming any chances to get new trade rules to cover 
service industries and copyright theft 
third world leaders say the subsidies steal potential markets 
from their farmers ruining agriculture in their countries

farm manufacturing giant deere amp co on 
tuesday reported its fourthquarter earnings fell 27 percent from a 
year ago due mainly to lower production of lawncare and 
industrial products 
deere reported net income of 745 million or 98 cents a share 
in the quarter ended oct 31 down from 1032 million or 137 
per share in the same period of 1989 
revenue totaled 206 billion up 3 percent from the 2 billion 
earned in the same three months last year 
deere attributed the earnings decline to lower production of its 
lawn and groundscare products and industrial equipment it also 
cited higher sales incentive costs in an extremely competitive 
market as well as a fourweek strike at the companys lawn and 
groundscare equipment factory in wisconsin 
the company has put about 500 factory workers on indefinite 
layoff in the past two months in response to slumping sales in 
addition plant shutdowns will idle 4500 workers in iowa and 
illinois in the next couple of weeks as the company tries to slow 
down production to match demand 
company spokesman robert j combs said uncertainty over the 
economy and the persian gulf standoff were combining to depress 
sales of farm equipment and other products 
theres an atmosphere of uncertainty weve been seeing since 
august combs said as a result we expect north american farm 
equipment sales to be somewhat lowerour response has been to 
reduce production levels for 1991 by 12 percent

decline the farm credit insurance and health care operations 
earned 337 million in the quarter down from 365 million last

competition has revolutionalized relations 
between management and labor who have found in many industries 
that they have to become partners to survive in the second of a 
threepart series the new workplace midwest regional reporter 
sharon cohen explores the changes that have led to no more us vs 
them 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
each monday two guys named mike get 
together to talk about their future their jobs seemingly make them 
rivals but in fact they share a goal survival 
mike obrien is a union leader mike spitzley is a company man 
but in their meetings here at the general motors plant the two 
talk costs labor quality topics workers wouldnt have been 
privy to years ago 
most of the things we talk about its we its not us vs 
them weve pretty much recognized our goals are the same said 
spitzley manager of gms 5300worker cartruck plant we make 
decisions together i dont think theres anything i know i 
wouldnt tell them if they asked me 
theres something different going on said obrien 
president of uaw local 95 years ago it wasnt any of our 
business what went on in the business 
like two boxers bloodied and bruised union and management in a 
small number of industries mostly auto and steel have stopped 
fighting instead theyre joining forces sharing ideas and 
working together in ways they never would have before 
nowadays blue and white collar company and union travel 
lobby and meet customers together in perhaps the most 
revolutionary example saturn corp both parties share all big 
decisions from choosing suppliers to the advertising agency for 
the new auto company 
an adversarial relationship cannot be compatible with todays 
market were part of a world trade were no longer king this and 
king that said john smith administrative assistant to the 
president of the united steelworkers of america 
survival is probably not too strong a word for what drives the 
two parties together said steelworkers president lynn williams 
though theres a growing alliance conflict remains as 
evidenced by bitter strikes against the new york daily news 
eastern airlines and pittston co 
some labor officials also contend unions acceptance of 
concessions in the 80s didnt ensure job security and 
cooperation they say really is coopting 
the largest loss is the unions autonomy we become one with 
the corporate agenda its an unnatural place for the union to 
be said jerry tucker of the new directions movement a dissident 
autoworkers group 
even so a survey released this year found at least half of 350 
unionized manufacturers had some formal joint activities most 
begun in the 1980s 
weve never seen anything as widespread in our own history 
said william cooke a professor and associate dean at wayne state 
university who conducted the survey and wrote a book on the topic 
in every case its come out of the same if we dont change 
were out of the market the old way doesnt work well 
the biggest test of cooperation may be the layoffs and idling of 
plants in the current economic downturn hard times cooke said 
could have a demoralizing effect and perhaps even crush the more 
fragile partnerships 
if workers perceive management as doing this without due 
consideration for the welfare of employees it will have the 
potential of destroying the efforts altogether cooke said if 
employees have information shared with them about the market 
then employees generally speaking are able to accept management 
decisionmaking 
cookes survey found partnerships in almost all industries 
including trucking mining and public utilities but they tend to 
be most common in autos and steel both battered by foreign 
competition plant closings and job losses 
in the steel industry the workforce shrank from 453200 in 1979 
to 168900 in 1989 the american iron and steel institute said the 
average annual employment in the auto industry dropped from 990000 
to 857000 in the same period the government said 
union ranks have shrunk too nationwide 17 percent of workers 
were represented by a union in 1989 compared with 20 percent six 
years earlier 
for partnerships to make their businesses more competitive 
experts say both sides must adapt managers must relinquish some 
authority and give workers more responsibility while unions must 
become more flexible to increase competitiveness 
the auto industry has been in the vanguard of this movement 
with joint training health and safety education and quality 
programs some since the 1970s 
labormanagement partnerships vary in scope for example 
atampt and the communications workers of america and 
international brotherhood of electrical workers formed a joint 
nonprofit corporation in 1986 that provides training and job 
placement and finances employee education about 66200 atampt 
workers have participated in the programs 
the ccwa however adopted a measure this summer expressing 
anger over layoffs consolidations and forced transfers and 
questioning cooperation with the company 
northwest aluminum co in the dalles ore reopened in 1986 
under new ownership with a team concept and a new philosophy labor 
and management participate in interviewing prospective employees 
union meetings are held on company property management attends at 
the beginning to answer questions there no longer are separate 
workermanager showers or christmas parties 
those little things when you stack them up put them in a 
bucket made a big difference said personnel manager dick schon 
we argue like hell its not a lovein the difference is 
basically i think we are a team 
the new united motor manufacturing inc a toyotagm venture 
in fremont calif holds quarterly unionmanagement meetings and 
representatives from both parties share an office in the labor 
relations department 
theyre treating workers as if people had brains before you 
had to check your brain outside when you came in the door in the 
morning said george nano bargaining committee chairman for uaw 
local 2244 
the plant has a rancorous labormanagement record when operated 
by gm alone it was like a war here nano said adding that now 
its not peaches and cream but its a hell of a lot better 
theres probably no more innovative partnership than at saturn 
the gm subsidiary in spring hill tenn 
the union has a seat on the plants governing body saturns 
president and uaw coordinator have offices in the same suite and do 
business together all major decisions including product design 
suppliers dealers equipment machinery investments are made by 
consensus 
in one ad one saturn autoworker explains weve had our share 
of knockdowndragouts over the years its hard to tell 
engineers from technicians and you know it doesnt seem to 
matter its just labor and management on the same team 
its like a marriage said mike bennett uaw local 1853 
president at saturn you make vows fidelity is a matter of 
choice both gm and the uaw are working to make this marriage 
work

former vernon savings association owner don r 
dixon blamed his employees for wrongdoing at the failed thrift as 
testimony ended in his bank fraud trial tuesday 
i thought they were loyal at the time said dixon who took 
the stand for the third time 
dixon is charged with 38 counts of bank fraud misapplication of 
funds conspiracy and other crimes he is accused of using vernon 
money for prostitutes personal beach homes in california and 
illegal political contributions 
dixon bought the smalltown thrift in 1981 and its assets grew 
more than tenfold by the time he sold it in 1986 
the following hear vernon failed at a cost to taxpayers of more 
than 12 billion it was one of the first costly collapses of the 
thrift crisis and focused national attention on the troubled 
industry 
federal prosecutors and defense attorney billy ravkind were 
scheduled to present closing arguments wednesday before the case 
goes to the jury if convicted on all counts dixon could be 
sentenced to up to 190 years in prison and fined as much as 95 
million 
the trial began in midoctober and included more than four weeks 
of testimony from about 25 prosecution witnesses and a handful for 
the defense 
dixon took the stand in his own behalf friday monday and for 
about 30 minutes tuesday he finished by repeating his contention 
that he did not authorize vernon officers to reimburse themselves 
with vernon funds for donations to political candidates 
he said he gave conditional approval telling the executives 
to check with attorneys before reimbursing themselves 
if those officers had thought it was illegal not one of them 
told me dixon said 
later prosecutors recalled one witness george mcguffey who 
was dixons loan officer at republic bank in dallas for eight 
years 
mcguffey disputed dixons testimony that republic allowed him to 
redirect money it loaned him from one project to another he also 
said dixon would have had to document any use of republics money 
for purposes other than what it was borrowed for 
mcguffey also said republic did not make financial agreements on 
a handshake as dixon said he did with a dallas developer 
concerning payments on a 1 million beach house near san diego 
prosecutors contend dixon developed an elaborate scheme using 
developer james atkinson to pay for the house preventing its 
discovery by federal regulators

lighten the atmosphere on some flights this week but theyre not 
allowed to make jokes about the companys bankruptcy court filing 
peter bales one of five comics chosen said the airlines 
financial troubles were the least of his worries turbulent skies 
on the newarknew haven conn route on monday forced the standup 
comedian to deliver his 10minute shtick sitting down 
its difficult to be funny when youre try not to vomit 
bales said in a telephone interview tuesday from his home in 
northport ny 
on monday the airline said it would continue normal operations 
while it seeks protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the 
federal bankruptcy laws the nations fifthlargest airline said a 
22 billion debt and increased jet fuel costs due to the persian 
gulf crisis forced the move 
continental first served up cabin comedy on its 
detroitcleveland route in august said spokeswoman nancy compel 
this week its continental express division is offering standup 
comedians and business speakers on its 46seat commuter service to 
new haven the serious stuff in the mornings and the funny stuff 
in the afternoons 
the promotion was hatched two months ago and will continue 
despite the bankruptcy proceedings continental said 
its going well compel said tuesday travelers seem to 
enjoy it even though it was a little bit rough and our comedian 
had to sit down 
the comedians were advised last week to keep the cabin humor 
clean and not make jokes about airplanes 
on monday compel said she told them the news of the day 
and reminded them to stay away from inappropriate material 
bales said he avoided negative airline jokes but added that he 
generally says what he wants 
he began by warning hecklers they would be asked to leave then 
he griped about the gig saying there were two guys with 
headphones in his dressing room 
the jokes were delivered while he was strapped into his seat 
with his head craning down the aisle to catch a glimmer of response 
over the noisy engines 
i thought at one point i got applause but i think my ears were 
just popping from the pressure he said

a late burst of buying sparked by rumors that 
iraq was considering withdrawing from kuwait lifted the stock 
market to its third consecutive gain today 
the markets major indicators were trading well below mondays 
closing levels late in the session when rumors swept the market 
that iraq had come up with a new proposal to withdraw from kuwait 
the rumors based on a british television news report fanned 
speculation the persian gulf crisis could be resolved without 
bloodshed 
up until those reports circulated in the last half hour of 
trading the market was generally lower on what analysts attributed 
chiefly to profittaking in the wake of a big gain on friday and a 
smaller advance on monday 
bank stocks were doing well however in the wake of todays 
anouncement by the federal reserve that it was easing reserve 
requirements to stimulate lending and ease a credit crunch hurting

ousted centrust chairman david paul a national 
symbol of excess in the savings and loan crisis lost his bid 
tuesday to keep from paying 308 million in restitution sought by 
federal regulators 
us district judge edward davis rejected pauls motion for a 
temporary injunction to hold off the office of thrift supervision 
but paul attorney sanford bohrer promised an appeal even before 
seeing the opinion saying what ots did doesnt bear any 
resemblance to what the constitution requires 
davis ruling did not address a deadline for paul to pay up but 
ots attorney deborah siegel said hypothetically the order has 
always been in force and the bond is due 
thrift regulators ordered paul to submit the bond by nov 1 to 
cover centrust funds converted to his personal use but payment was 
delayed by pauls appeal 
ots targeted a 15 million legal defense fund for the failed 
savings amp loans officers and directors sumptuous furnishings and 
fixtures at centrusts 47story office tower old masters paintings 
and a private dinner cooked by european chefs flown in for the 
occasion 
paul centrusts majority stockholder until the resolution trust 
corp became conservator last february faces numerous civil suits 
over his control of floridas oncelargest thrift no criminal 
charges have been filed against him 
great western savings has acquired most of centrusts branches 
but its headquarters and moneylosing projects remain in federal 
hands the federal takeover already has cost an estimated 18 
billion 
bohrer attacked the restitution order as an alice in 
wonderland approach to due process that reached a judgment 
against paul without allowing him to defend himself 
what ots as done is theyve talked to themselves and said 
we should win this lawsuit shouldnt we and declared themselves 
the winner he said after learning of the ruling no proof or 
nothing 
bohrer said paul was in miami but would not make any comment

a federal judge on tuesday affirmed a us 
supreme court ruling that ordered the ltv corp to reassume 
liability for nearly 3 billion in employee pension plans it 
stopped funding in 1987 
the dallas steel aerospace and energy concern which is in 
chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization had opposed restoring the 
plans because it claimed such a move could possibly force the 
company to liquidate 
ltv lawyers had argued that the high court decided only legal 
issues regarding events that were three years old and had not taken 
into account the companys current financial situation 
attorneys for ltvs various creditors also had urged against 
returning liability to the company arguing that it could disrupt 
ltvs attempts to reorganize 
but us district judge robert sweet of manhattan rejected the 
companys and creditors position and granted a request by the 
federal pension benefit guaranty corp to make ltv take back 
responsibility for the pension plans 
in his 22page decision sweet said in view of the supreme 
courts holding pbgc is entitled to attempt to restore the plans 
before determining the effect or propriety of such action 
the pbgc insures pension benefits much like the federal deposit 
insurance corp insures bank deposits 
the high courts june ruling upheld pbgcs decision to force 
ltvs clevelandbased steel unit ltv steel corp to reassume 
pension obligations for three underfunded plans those plans were 
to provide for more than 60000 ltv retirees and active employees 
sweets decision means liability for the three funds will be 
transferred to ltv from the pbgc 
with todays order ltv can now take the necessary steps to 
complete its bankruptcy reorganization and emerge as a viable 
company while workers and retirees can have their full pensions as 
originally promised said pbgc executive director james b 
lockhart 
ltv spokesman charles m palmer said the company would continue 
to make payments from the pension plans 
because were in chapter 11 we cant put any additional money 
into the pension funds so future pensions will be paid from 
existing assets of the three plans palmer said 
last month the pbgc issued a proposed payment schedule for the 
restored plans that would allow ltv to pay its unfunded pension 
liabilities over a 30year period 
we believe the proposal is not workable but we would expect to 
have more discussions in the future palmer said 
sweet conceded that his order left unresolved the survival of 
ltv and the means by which the benefits under its pension plans are 
to be paid 
the judge recommended that all parties involved in the dispute 
select an arbitrator to address these problems 
the difficulty of these issues has engaged and to date 
defeated the best efforts of administrators judges and legislators 
at all levels sweet wrote perhaps all parties should agree 
than an instancespecific global solution would be preferable to 
the continuation of the present trench warfare 
ltv filed for protection from its creditors in july 1986 
the litigation stems back to 1987 when ltv stopped funding the 
pension plans and the pbgc assumed liability 
a few months later a new ltv labor contract with the united 
steelworkers of america restored some retirement benefits similar 
to those in the terminated plans 
the pbgc ordered ltv to reassume liability for the three 
terminated plans when ltv challenged the order pbgc went to 
court 
in 1988 sweet ruled that the agency improperly ordered ltv to 
reassume the plans operations a year later a federal appeals 
court agreed that pbgc had exceeded its legal authority 
but the supreme court reversed the lower courts and sided with 
the pbgc

a report that iraq may be ready to withdraw from 
kuwait peacefully triggered a powerful rally in the stock market on 
tuesday lifting key market indicators to their third consecutive 
advance 
the news that suggested the persian gulf crisis could be 
resolved without an armed conflict between iraq and the 
multinational military force led by the united states ignited a 
market that sank gradually for much of the afternoon 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which was down more 
than 25 pouints with a half hour left in the session finished with 
a gain of 1411 points to close at 257970 
that represented a turnaround of about 40 points in only 30 
minutes 
this is a news headline type of market said larry wachtel 
a market analyst for prudentialbache securities he said the 
report turned market psychology around even without official 
confirmation 
but he warned that if the report proves inaccurate the market 
could reverse course just as quickly 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in 
nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted stocks with 
907 up 639 down and 457 unchanged 
volume on the floor of the big board came to 18582 million 
shares up from 17707 million in the previous session 
nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including 
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the 
overthecounter market totaled 22706 million shares 
news of a british satellite television report that iraq would be 
willing to withdraw from kuwait in as long as it was not attacked 
and could keep the disputed rumailah oil field triggered the rally 
at about 330 pm est 
wachtel said the report triggered buying in the futures markets 
which in turn set off a scramble to buy the stocks on which stock 
index futures contracts are based 
but wachtel and several other analysts said that the stock 
market faces some tough going given the depressed state of the 
economy and the damaging effect that that may have on corporate 
profits 
the market is getting a little tired dennis jarrett chief 
market analyst at kidder peabody amp co said before the late 
turnaround 
he said the markets early decline reflected profittaking in 
the wake of last weeks 32 pointplus advance in the dow jones 
industial average 
that advance had included gains of 4084 points in the dow 
industrials on friday and another 594 point rise on monday

barrel up 151 at the new york mercantile exchange on contracts 
for january delivery later contract months all settled higher 
mostly by more than 1 per barrel 
but soon after the mercantile exchange had closed for the day 
oil traders were jolted when they received word of a british 
television news report indicating that iraq might have a plan for 
pulling its army out of kuwait 
sky television news said iraq might be ready to withdraw from 
most of kuwait as long as it is allowed to keep the disputed 
rumailah oil field and as long as it gets a guarantee that western 
forces will not attack 
prices for petroleum at loading platforms and docks commonly 
called the cash or spot market tumbled by more than 1 per barrel 
minutes after the mercantile exchange closed traders said the 
cash market ordinarily follows the bahavior of prices at the 
exchange which is known as the futures market 
thats a lot said thomas p blakeslee an energy analyst 
with pegasus econometric group inc in hoboken nj they 
usually dont move as dramatically as on the futures market 
because its not an open cry system 
in early afternoon trading on the mercantile exchange oil 
prices had fallen on a report indicating kuwait might be willing to 
negotiate the future of some of its islands if iraq withdraws its 
troops which invaded the oilrich emirate on aug 2 
but it did not continue to sell off in fact it snapped back 
up said brian tagler a broker with shearson lehman brothers 
inc everybody interpreted that as as a very bullish event the 
fact that the market did not collapse 
crude oil futures shot up nearly 2 above their lows for the 
day puzzling many traders 
once the market was closed they began trying to piece together 
what had happened before news of the british television report came 
in and they began nervously watching the cash market financial 
markets that were still open at that point made sharp moves on the 
possibility of peace in the gulf 
futures prices for refined petroleum products had moved pretty 
much in tandem with crude prices tuesday 
home heating oil rose 223 cents to 8690 cents a gallon on 
contracts for delivery in january unleaded gasoline for january 
delivery rose 240 cents to 7592 cents a gallon 
natural gas prices which are not directly affected by the 
potential for mideast war fell 35 cents to 244 per 1000 cubic 
feet on contracts for delivery in january 
later tuesday the american petroleum institute reported that 
the nations supply of crude oil fell last week to 3355 million 
barrels down from 3371 million barrels a week earlier and 3519 
million barrels a year earlier 
the stockpile of gasoline was at 2211 million barrels up from 
2183 million barrels a week earlier but down from 2231 million 
barrels a year earlier api said in its weekly report the 
stockpile of distillates which include home heating oil totaled 
1329 million barrels down from 1348 million barrels a week 
earlier but up from 1215 million barrels a year earlier api said

the conviction of robert morris for unleashing a 
computer worm program in 1988 should be overturned because he 
didnt intend to paralyze thousands of computers linked to a 
nationwide program his attorney told an appeals court tuesday 
the oral arguments in morris appeal were presented to three 
judges of the 2nd us circuit court of appeals who didnt 
immediately make a decision 
morris 25 of arnold md was the first person brought to 
trial under a section of a 1986 federal computer fraud and abuse 
law that makes it a felony to break into a federal computer network 
and prevent authorized use of the system 
the former cornell university student was convicted at trial and 
sentenced to three years probation 400 hours of community service 
and a 10000 fine 
the appeal presentations of defense attorney thomas guidoboni 
and the prosecutor justice department attorney ellen meltzer 
focused on their different interpretations of the law which a 
federal jury in syracuse found morris violated 
morris worm immobilized an estimated 6000 computers linked to 
the internet network including ones at nasa military facilities 
and major universities witnesses testified that it did not 
permanently harm the computers or computer files but in some cases 
victims were unable to use their computers for several days while 
the worm was hunted down and removed from their computers 
morris testified during his trial that he had made a programming 
error that caused the worm to go berserk and cripple the internet 
system on nov 2 1988 
he said he did not intend to cause permanent damage to computer 
files only to infiltrate the networks security 
in court tuesday guidoboni said he interpreted the computer 
fraud law to mean that the government had to prove that morris not 
only intended to access the computer program but also planned to 
interrupt access for others 
he said there was insufficient evidence to support his 
interpretation of the statute 
the lawyer also claimed morris did not break into computers 
illegally but rather merely exceeded authority already given to 
him for computer access 
meltzer however argued that the conviction should stand 
because the language of the law explicitly stated that proof that a 
hacker intended to cause damage or loss to others was not required 
the appeals court will issue a written opinion at a later date

the dollar fell sharply against other major 
currencies tuesday hit hard by the federal reserves decision to 
ease its grip on interest rates and by a news report that iraq may 
be willing to withdraw from kuwait 
gold prices were mixed falling overseas and then rising in new 
york 
the dollar first slumped after the fed said it was relaxing its 
reserve requirements for banks an unusual move aimed at 
stimulating the deteriorating economy by easing a shortage of 
credit 
the central bank said its action the first change in reserve 
requirements since 1983 was taken in part for technical reasons 
but also to encourage banks to increase lending 
ideally if banks have more money to lend interest rates would 
fall although some private economists questioned whether that 
would in fact be the result of the fed move but the foreign 
exchange markets taking no chances sold the dollar down 
the dollar like all currencies draws support from higher 
interest rates which make us investments more attractive when 
rates fall the dollar tends to follow suit 
the us currency took another hit shortly before the close of 
trading after a british news report said iraq may be ready to 
withdraw from most of kuwait as long as it is allowed to keep the 
disputed rumailah oil field 
the report raised the prospects for a peaceful end to the middle 
east crisis the dollar seen as a relatively safe investment in 
times of international strife has advanced as tensions increased 
in recent months and dropped as they were defused 
james t mcgroarty senior vice president with greenwich capital 
markets inc noted that the dollar stormed higher last week as the 
persian gulf situation appeared to worsen that surge upward made 
the dollar particularly vulnerable to a sharp decline he said 
the british pound rose against the dollar tuesday in new york 
sterling closed at 192925 up from 19180 late monday in london 
earlier the pound rose to 19255 from 19205 late monday 
the dollar fell to 13330 japanese yen in new york from 134735 
late monday in tokyo overnight the dollar rose 135 yen to a 
closing 13435 yen and it was later quoted in london at 13400 
yen 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with mondays late 
quotes included 15030 german marks down from 151395 12825 
swiss francs down from 12935 50825 french francs down from 
51135 112925 italian lire down from 113800 and 116325 
canadian dollars down from 116625 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late monday 
included 15030 german marks down from 15125 12840 swiss 
francs down from 12915 50835 french francs down from 51113 
16955 dutch guilders down from 17055 113000 italian lire 
down from 113700 and 11638 canadian dollars down from 11655 
gold advanced in new york climbing 230 on the commodity 
exchange to close at 37890 a troy ounce republic national bank 
later quoted a bid of 37625 up 75 cents 
gold fell earlier in london to a late bid price of 37820 a 
troy ounce from 38050 late monday in zurich the metal fell to a 
closing bid of 37740 from 38085 late monday 
in hong kong gold fell 337 to close at a bid 37669 
silver prices advanced the metal rose 13 cents on the 
commodity exchange closing at 4151 a troy ounce earlier silver 
rose in london to a late bid price of 418 a troy ounce from 
mondays 416

sales of new homes dropped 35 percent in 
october to the lowest level in eight years the government reported 
tuesday but analysts said the free fall may be bottoming out and 
sales should begin rebounding by spring 
sales should be leveling off at this number in the fourth 
quarter and the first quarter of next year assuming mortgage 
rates continue to fall and the mideast problem is resolved said 
economist david g seiders of the national association of home 
builders 
economist mark obrinsky of the federal national mortgage 
association suggested sales may zigzag for several months but 
assuming no blowup in the middle east i expect to see a more 
sustained pickup by spring of 1991 
sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 491000 the 
departments of commerce and housing and urban development said in a 
joint release that was the lowest since 480000 new homes were 
sold in october 1982 a month before the 198182 recession ended 
so far this year new home sales were off 158 percent from the 
same period of 1989 
sales fell 4 percent in september and 2 percent in august the 
september figure was revised down from 6 percent in the 
departments initial estimate but the october total was worse than 
the 18 percent drop first reported 
obrinsky said the main reason for the decline is great 
consumer uncertainty and generally negative buying sentiment 
consumers he said are experiencing rising prices caused by the 
persian gulf crisis and increasing unemployment as the economy 
slows 
but really the big one is the great uncertainty over the 
mideast concern over war breaking out obrinsky added 
at the october sales pace it would take 84 months to exhaust 
the inventory of unsold homes up from 83 months in september 
there was a sevenmonth supply of unsold homes in october 1989 
but richard peach an economist with the mortgage bankers 
association said builders are cutting back on housing starts to 
counter the slow sales 
and once the market recovers youre going to find relatively 
few new homes he said that in turn will drive up prices which 
have been declining recently 
the median price of a new home in october was 121800 up from 
112900 in september but down from 123000 a year ago the median 
means half of the homes cost more half less 
seiders attributed the price increase to a hefty 474 percent 
gain in sales in the northeast which has the highest housing costs 
in the nation sales there totaled an annual rate of 84000 units 
after falling 129 percent the previous month 
sales in all other regions fell including a drop of 182 
percent in the west to 112000 units that was the lowest since 
106000 homes were sold in september 1982 
in the midwest sales were off 117 percent to 83000 units 
the lowest since 74000 homes were sold in august 1986 sales 
dropped 41 percent in the south to 212000 units

sutton holding corp a new york investment 
group that has been pursuing desoto inc proposed acquiring the 
manufacturer through a merger 
in a letter to des plaines illbased desotos board of 
directors sutton chairman william spier proposed a merger in which 
stockholders would get 425 per share in cash and securities 
the securities would entitle shareholders to a pro rata share in 
the proceeds from any dissolution of desotos pension plans 
this security could be distributed as a dividend to desoto 
stockholders immediately prior to consummation of our 
acquisition spier said in the letter dated dec 3 which was 
included in a sutton filing with the securities and exchange 
commission 
in october desoto shareholders approved a plan to sell off most 
of the companys assets and terminate its pension plans in return 
for a onetime dividend of 3550 per share 
under the restructuring the company would sell substantially all 
of its businesses including its domestic consumer paint business 
which has supplied sears roebuck amp co for 80 years 
only desotos detergent business would be retained 
desoto has estimated that the partial liquidation and 
restructuring would raise about 222 million before taxes with 85 
million earmarked to retire corporate debt 
it noted that its plan to terminate pension plans and recover 
some 28 million in excess assets is subject to approval by the 
internal revenue service and the pension benefit guaranty corp 
the federal agency that guarantees workers pensions much like the 
federal deposit insurance corp guarantees bank deposits

prices for stocks and bonds jumped sharply and 
oil fell on the cash market in late afternoon trading tuesday after 
a british television report of an iraqi withdrawal plan raced 
through the financial markets 
the dow jones average of 30 bluechip stocks which was down 
more than 25 points with a half hour left in trading finished with 
a gain of 1411 points to close at 257970 
the move amounted to a turnaround of about 40 points in 30 
minutes 
bond prices also moved higher the treasurys bellwether 30year 
bond closed up point or 5 per 1000 in face amount its yield 
which falls when prices rise was down to 832 percent from 836 
percent late monday 
this is a news headline type of market said larry wachtel 
a stock market analyst for prudentialbache securities he said the 
report turned market psychology around even without official 
confirmation 
but he warned that the market could reverse course just as 
quickly if the report proved inaccurate 
news of the british television report hit trading floors just 
after 330 pm est sky television news said iraq might be ready 
to withdraw from most of kuwait as long as it was allowed to keep a 
disputed oil field and as long as it received a guarantee that 
western forces would not attack 
a multinational force of more than 400000 led by the united 
states has been deployed in the region to oppose iraq following 
the passage of a un resolution last week iraq has been given 
until jan 15 to withdraw or face possible attack 
the oil futures market had just closed when the iraq report 
reached us financial markets but the news pushed prices down on 
the cash market where the commodity is picked up and delivered 
prices for petroleum at loading platforms and docks also called 
the spot market tumbled by more than 1 per barrel to below 30 
minutes after the futures market closed 
in futures trading on the new york mercantile exchange light 
sweet crude for january delivery had settled at 3066 a barrel up 
151 prices on the cash market have closely followed those at the 
exchange throughout the persian gulf crisis 
also tuesday some stock and bond prices were buoyed by the 
federal reserves loosening of bank reserve requirements 
the feds move followed other important crediteasing steps by 
the central bank including a steady lowering of the federal funds 
rate 
this validates the view that the fed is on a prolonged path of 
easing it doesnt initiate it it strengthens it said richard 
b hoey managing director and chief economist at barclays de zoete 
wedd government securities inc 
in the longterm the progressive easing in credit conditions 
could soften the negative effects of an economic slowdown and 
potentially strengthen the stock market some analysts said

northwest airlines is planning on retaining 
its ranking as the nations fourth largest carrier despite a spate 
of setbacks the carrier has suffered in recent years 
the public knows we run a safe airline and an airline of 
integrity these things can happen to any airline northwest 
spokesman doug miller said after the latest disaster a runway 
collision monday that left eight people dead at detroit 
metropolitan airport 
in the past four years northwest has suffered through two 
crashes a takeover bitter labor strife and the convictions of 
three pilots for flying while intoxicated 
mondays runway collision came three years after northwest 
flight 255 went down near the same airport killing 156 people in 
the secondworst air crash in us history 
in that aug 16 1987 accident the md80 failed to gain 
altitude during takeoff and slammed into a highway overpass the 
national transportation safety board ruled that the pilots didnt 
set the planes wing flaps and slats properly for takeoff and that 
failure ff a cockpit warning device contributed to the crash 
northwest gained its fourthplace ranking behind united 
airlines american airlines and delta airlines after the 
eaganbased carrier acquired instate rival republic airlines for 
884 million in august 1986 
what followed was an epidemic of late flights and lost baggage 
roundly attributed to union warfare that stemmed from pay 
disparities as union leaders fought the company for more than two 
years to unify contracts many former republic workers were getting 
paid less than their northwest counterparts 
by the time los angeles investor al checchi led a 365 billion 
buyout completed aug 3 1989 the airline was fighting to overcome 
a new nickname northworst 
checchi ushered in new management and improved service the 
airline in march 1988 already had scored points with some travelers 
by banning smoking on all of its domestic flights not just on 
flights of two hours or less as federal rules mandated 
but other problems mounted 
on dec 28 1989 northwest publicized a bomb threat it received 
for a dec 30 flight from paris to detroit more than 100 people 
canceled their reservations for the flight 28 passengers and 14 
crew members made the trip 
on jan 4 1990 an engine fell off a threeengine northwest 
plane flying from miami to minneapolis the boeing 727 landed 
safely in tampa fla federal officials said improper maintenance 
was involved and proposed a 200000 fine 
then on march 8 1990 three northwest pilots flying a boeing 
727 from fargo nd were arrested at minneapolisst paul 
international airport after authorities were alerted that the 
pilots had been drinking heavily the night before the three became 
the first commercial pilots to be convicted for flying a jetliner 
while intoxicated their sentences ranged from one year to 16 
months 
that was followed with a company report in october that ground 
workers in atlanta filled the hydraulic systems of two dc9 jets 
with a mixture of hand soap and hydraulic fluid the airline said 
it was a mistake fifty flights were canceled around the country 
and 12 dc9s were grounded for inspections 
checchi called a news conference oct 16 to say that layoffs and 
a reduced flight schedule were imminent because of higher jet fuel 
prices brought on by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
but at the same meeting he told reporters the airline was in 
good financial shape and positioned to possibly acquire another 
airline or part of another airline the takeover debt stands at 
17 billion two years ahead of schedule and the company has cash 
reserves of 1 billion available 
despite a 47 percent drop in its thirdquarter earnings 
northwests market share in the first 10 months of this year was 
117 percent up 07 percent from the same period a year ago 
although northwest and other us carriers are expected to lose 
a total of more than 1 billion in the fourth quarter checchi said 
last week in an interview with the star tribune that he was content 
with the airlines position 
i feel that under circumstances were in pretty good shape 
he said but its nothing to crow about

an increase in the federal gasoline tax pushed 
up prices at the pump when they otherwise would have dropped the 
american automobile association said tuesday 
in its weekly survey aaa found the average nationwide retail 
price for a gallon of selfserve regular unleaded was up 21 cents 
at 1387 per gallon it was just 1 cent less than the aaas 
highest recorded price of 1388 per gallon just before the easter 
holiday in 1981 
selfserve unleaded had risen 312 cents a gallon since aug 1 
the day before iraq invaded kuwait and threw world oil markets into 
a state of chaos aaa said

a defense attorney conceded tuesday that a 
soybean trader at the chicago board of trade broke exchange rules 
but said he did not attempt to cheat customers or commit fraud 
the comments came during closing argumnents in the 11weekold 
trial of 10 soybean traders and brokers charged in a federal 
investigation of alleged corruption at the board of trade and 
chicago mercantile exchange 
attorney jim epstein called the governments evidence 
insubstantial conceded violations of board of trade rules and 
vigorously denied charges of wire fraud mail fraud and 
racketeering conspiracy 
did he violate the rules absolutely epstein said of his 
client martin j dempsey did he attempt to commit fraud 
absolutely not 
epstein told a federal court jury that testimony indicated many 
of the rule violations were common on the trading floor and often 
benefited customers for whom the defendants may have been trading 
one such violation is curb trading which occurs in the trading 
pit in the seconds or minutes after the closing bell 
sure he did curb trading epstein said of dempsey is he 
proud of it no did he try to conceal it of course he did but 
not because he was committing fraud but because he was 
breaking the rules 
the defense contended the prosecution wanted the jury believe 
concealing the trades was a sign of trying to cheat customers 
other than breaking the rule youre not cheating anyone 
epstein said 
the attorney also contended that government witnesses lied and 
presented misleading testimony 
earlier in their closing arguments prosecutors scoffed at the 
idea that traders broke the rules to benefit customers 
these men intended to get money from customers under false 
pretenses assistant us attorney mark rotert said they think 
things like ethics fairness and the law are a matter of context 
in all 48 people have been indicted after fbi agents posed as 
traders and secretly taperecorded conversations
