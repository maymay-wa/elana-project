fbi agents arrested a former army sergeant in 
tampa fla thursday night on charges he conspired to pass 
sensitive information about the defense of europe to hungary and 
czechoslovakia the justice department said 
roderick james ramsay 28 worked in west germany directly under 
clyde lee conrad a retired us army sergeant who was convicted of 
treason by a west german court and given a life sentence earlier 
this week ramsay was arrested without incident the fbi said 
ramsay was accused of conspiring to gather and deliver defense 
information to a foreign government the fbi said the justice 
department said in a news release that the information included 
sensitive plans for the defense of central europe and the use of 
tactical nuclear weapons by us forces and nato allies 
we cant give details but its fair to say the information 
would have been very useful to the soviet union us attorney 
robert w genzman said at a latenight news conference in tampa 
ramsay was held at an undisclosed location in the tampa area and 
will appear before a federal magistrate on friday genzman said 
neither guzman nor fbi agents would say how many people overall 
were involved in the alleged spy ring and the justice departments 
announcement referred to the investigation as continuing 
court papers filed in the case in tampa charge that for 20000 
ramsay gave conrad the documents as well as technical manuals about 
military communications technology and material about the 
coordination of nato forces 
the material was passed to the hungarian and czechoslovakian 
intelligence services according to the court papers 
an affidavit filed in court and made available in washington 
noted that in january 1986 conrad visited ramsay and gave him a 
cow bell conrad told ramsay that anyone displaying a similar cow 
bell was involved in the spy ring the affidavit said 
the justice department said that several search warrants were 
being served by fbi agents in conjunction with ramsays arrest 
ramsay served from 1983 through 1985 in the 8th infantry division 
g3 plans section in bad kreuznach as the assistant document 
custodian the justice department said in a news release the g3 
section of a division is in charge of the military operations of the 
unit 
his duties included safeguarding all classified and military 
documents and he held a top secret clearance working directly under 
conrad 
the affidavit charged that in december 1985 ramsay videotaped 
hundreds of documents and made them available to conrad for their 
eventual sale to the czechs and hungarians 
the case was an outgrowth of the investigation of conrad the fbi 
said 
fbi director william s sessions said the investigation was one 
of the most complicated of its kind ever undertaken by the bureau 
and the information passed on was extremely sensitive 
conrad was arrested in august 1988 the trial judge in his case 
said his offense passing secrets to hungary and czechoslovakia from 
1975 through 1985 in return for 12 million endangered the 
entire defense capability of the west and could have led to a 
breakdown in the defenses of the western alliance and to 
capitulation and the use of nuclear weapons on german territory 
in reporting wednesday night that ramsay had been targeted by the 
fbi abc news said the conradramsay espionage ring had smuggled 
computer parts from the united states to the east bloc through 
canada 
but a top official in the chief federal prosecutors office in 
karlsruhe alexander prechtel said thursday that conrad had turned 
over defense strategic papers he denied that smuggling of 
computer parts was involved 
the documents concerned nato and american troops in germany and 
europe prechtel said but he would not elaborate 
normally everything goes to the soviet union but we can only 
prove the way to czechoslovakia and hungary and the rest is 
speculation prechtel said 
according to court records conrad was introduced to the 
hungarian secret service in late autumn 1975 by his supervisor in 
the 8th infantry division former us army sgt 1st class zoltan 
szabo 
szabo who was convicted of espionage in austria in 1989 
received a 10month suspended sentence he identified for 
investigators some of the documents the court said conrad sold to 
the hungarians 
conviction of espionage conspiracy carries a maximum penalty of 
life imprisonment

a new climate of tension pervades the middle 
east and israeli officials fear an increasingly strident war of 
words could escalate into a broader conflict 
i would say the region is entering a dangerous new phase its 
not simple rhetoric said gerald steinberg a middle east expert 
at bar ilan university near tel aviv 
israels major worry is president saddam hussein of iraq who has 
threatened to respond to any israeli attack by using weapons of mass 
destruction such as poison gas to destroy half of israel 
prime minister yitzhak shamir has countered with a warning that 
israel will defend itself if necessary 
adding to the tension is a recent palestinain raid israels long 
political crisis the likud governments refusal to participate in 
peace talks and the furor in arab countries over immigration of 
soviet jews to israel 
iraqs potential to produce biological weapons and its alleged 
desire for nuclear weapons are especially worrisome when coupled 
with its development of longrange missiles and reported plans to 
build a giant gun capable of hitting israel 
israeli officials and independent analysts said they did not 
expect iraq or other arab nations to launch a deliberate attack now 
but they said the atmosphere of tension and escalating rhetoric 
could trigger an unintended conflict 
yossi olmert director of the government press office said 
the situation is one in which talk of peace has stopped and talk 
of war has started 
iraq has already made moves that israel considers threatening 
for example israeli officials and analysts said iraq staged a 
ground forces exercise near the border with jordan moved missiles 
closer to israel in extreme western iraq and set up a joint air 
squadron with jordan that brought iraqi pilots to the israeli 
frontier 
sources who spoke on condition of they not be identified said the 
new iraqi threat added to israels defense burden requiring the 
military to go on alert when iraq moved forces in ways that could 
endanger israel 
also the prospect of a new round of palestinian terrorism has 
increased dramatically following a plo factions attempted seaborne 
raid on may 30 aimed at beachfront hotels on the jewish holiday of 
shavuot 
mohammed abbas head of the palestine liberation front which 
launched the raid told the kuwait daily alwatan that it was the 
beginning of a combat effort against the israeli enemy 
israeli security officials fear soviet jewish immigrants may 
become the next targets as they travel from moscow to israel via 
transit points in east europe such as bucharest romania and 
budapest hungary 
the foiled terror attack was a reprisal for the may 20 massacre 
of seven unarmed arab laborers by an israeli who authorities said 
was deranged 
eighteen palestinians and two israelis died in subsequent rioting 
and violence in the occupied west bank and gaza strip that gave new 
impetus to the 30monthold palestinian uprising 
shamirs rightwing government has been blamed for provoking 
tensions by encouraging new jewish settlements in occupied areas 
and rejecting us terms for a dialogue with palestinians in cairo 
foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain called on israel 
recently to engage palestinians in negotiations a tremor of 
danger may shake the region and if things drift further we risk a 
damaging escalation of violence he told reporters 
aharon levran a retired israeli brigadier general said that 
without assurance of soviet military and political support the arabs 
were unlikely to risk launching a war i dont see the arabs going 
to war now against israel when the international circumstances are 
not right levran said 
joseph alpher of the jaffee center for strategic studies in tel 
aviv said one cannot ignore the possibility that rhetoric will 
turn into an interarab commitment to genuinely escalate matters 
he said israels protracted political crisis and shamirs refusal 
to engage in peace talks weakened israels relationship with the 
united states and made israel look more vulnerable to radical arab 
states 
israel could do much to defuse tensions by starting a dialogue 
with palestinians and assuring the arabs that israel would not 
subsidize or encourage soviet jews to settle on occupied land he 
said 
its within our power to set things right alpher said 
dore gold also an analyst at the jaffee center said too much 
attention had been given to the palestinian problem while the 
overall arabisraeli arms race was ignored 
i think things can slip out of control unless a strong effort 
is made to promote declaratory confidence building measures among 
middle east nations he said

the coast guard has begun searching the waters 
near the virgin islands for a 77yearold british noblewoman missing 
with the small airplane she was piloting federal authorities said 
thursday night 
mary pomeroy was flying a piper 28 aircraft from the dutchfrench 
island of st martin to st croix in the us virgin islands when 
her plane disappeared tuesday said fred farrar a spokesman for the 
federal aviation administration 
a piper 28 is a singleengine plane and the distance from st 
martin to st croix is about 100 miles 
farrar said details were sketchy but it was believed that ms 
pomeroy was countess of malta or duchess of malta in the british 
nobility the name of a place attached to a title does not have to 
be in britain 
however reference books on the british nobility list her only as 
the sister of thomas de vautort pomeroy 10th viscount of harberton 
the reference material gives her home as the isle of wight 
ms pomeroy was alone in the airplane when it left st martin 
about 305 pm tuesday flying under visual flight rules farrar 
said she radioed about seven minutes later that she was in level 
flight at about 4500 feet and that was the last transmission from 
the plane 
a squall line had been reported between st martin and st croix 
about that time farrar said 
the search for ms pomeroy did not begin until wednesday because 
it was initially reported that she had turned back to st martin 
farrar said 
coast guard helicopters a c130 airplane and a cutter searched 
an area about 40 miles from st martin but found nothing he said

columbia will have to be rolled back 
to the hangar next week so nasa can repair a hydrogen leak a move 
that leaves the shuttles astronomy mission up in the air and 
disrupts the years flight plans 
safetys the first priority and weve got an item here which 
we absolutely have got to put to bed and were going to do that 
launch director bob sieck said wednesday 
the leak had forced nasa to scrub last weeks launch of the 
shuttle with the 150 million astro observatory 
on wednesday a test in which supercold liquid hydrogen was 
pumped into columbias big external fuel tank confirmed the leak is 
in a tight cavity between two metal plates that connect the orbiter 
and the tank sieck said 
to fix the leak the orbiter will have to be separated from the 
tank in the hangar he said even then it will be hard to pinpoint 
the leak because it seems to occur under extremely cold conditions 
only sieck said 
sieck declined to estimate when columbia might be able to lift 
off nasa officials have said it will take about a month to return 
the shuttle to the hangar and perform repairs the move will take 
place sometime next week 
the astro mission is one of six remaining shuttle flights 
scheduled for 1990 its virtually certain now one of the missions 
will be pushed into next year or later because of columbias 
problems but sieck said preparations for atlantis secret military 
flight in july will continue 
shuttles have been moved from the launch pad back to the hangar 
twice because of mechanical failures and once because of payload 
problems 
when last weeks launch attempt was scrubbed columbias mission 
already was two weeks late because of cooling system repairs 
its always disappointing when the hardware is bad to you and 
that looks like what weve got here sieck said but were 
reminded its a complex system and things dont always go for the 
plan 
astro an onboard observatory consisting of three ultraviolet 
telescopes and one xray telescope was to have gone up in 1986 but 
the challenger explosion postponed the mission depriving nasa of 
the chance to see halleys comet 
comet austin discovered last year is on its way out of the 
solar system and the chances of seeing it grow slimmer every day

debra gilbert was in her nightgown fixing 
breakfast when an ax broke through the front door as a dozen police 
officers waving shotguns swarmed her house she heard her husband 
yell she doesnt know anything she doesnt know 
what she didnt know was that her husband of four years was 
connected to the mob she didnt know he had killed three times and 
she didnt know the shambles her life would become 
yet even after she knew she stood by him when he agreed to 
testify against organized crime buddies living a bizarre life of 
fear that included time in a threeroom police station apartment 
she watched as her husband manipulated authorities serving his 
murder sentence while living the high life complete with 
thousanddollar expense accounts and beach house vacations when 
peter gilbert died of a heart attack in june 1988 he still was in 
custody but was driving alone to go skydiving in a buick stocked 
with cocaine 
i know a lot of people out there would say boy shes the 
biggest fool who ever walked this earth mrs gilbert said in an 
interview at her brooksville fla home but how many people can 
say they loved someone enough to love them blindly 
the case of peter gilbert offers an unusual glimpse into the 
sometimes peculiar world of crime and punishment where a man so 
skilled in manipulation can take not only his wife for a ride but 
also police and prosecutors 
his escapade rocked providences police department and led gov 
edward d diprete to order a state police investigation fourteen 
officers face disciplinary action for unprofessional conduct and a 
special prosecutor was named april 30 to take the case to a grand 
jury for possible criminal indictments 
a state judge is even considering overturning a conviction that 
was based on peter gilberts testimony because of all the lies 
the fiasco as the internal investigation calls it is 
expected to cost nearly 1 million by the time all the probes are 
completed 
then the state of rhode island and especially myself will be 
able to put pieces together and not feel like there is anything 
missing anymore mrs gilbert said 
a consummate con man peter gilbert made up in charisma what he 
lacked in conscience he told debra their marriage was his first 
when it was at least his fifth standing 5 feet 5 inches with a 
scruffy beard and tattoos peter hardly seemed the ladys man debra 
knew he had children but she wasnt one to ask a lot of questions 
when they met in florida she was a high school dropout with 
three young children peter lived next door when the man she had 
married at 16 walked out 
he was my hero that came along and loved me and my children 
she said in her soft southern lilt 
she married him in 1981 in the brooksville courthouse believing 
he was james harold cassidy the charade crumbled a year later when 
he was arrested for burglarizing a church and a lumberyard police 
said he was peter gilbert a man who lived half his life as a 
criminal 
i couldnt understand why he lied to me i left him she said 
peter told her he lied only to get away from his past he said he 
stole to pay for the birth of their newborn daughter kiya he wrote 
poems from jail to win her forgiveness 
now that kiya binds our love there is no yesterday 
just tomorrow just for us our love will show the way 
a few months later peter escaped from a holding cell by knocking 
out another man who was to go before a judge on a minor charge 
peter took his place pleaded guilty to the other mans infraction 
and walked free 
he fled to rhode island against the advice of family and 
friends debra quit her waitressing job in brooksville to join him 
after a oneyear separation 
i was raising four kids and they missed him she said he 
said i was his life and after calling me all the time i believed 
him 
in rhode island she wondered why his beeper supposedly for his 
job at an auto body shop went off at all hours with strange 
messages she asked enough to learn he was involved with drugs 
but didnt pry 
i didnt want to know to be honest said debra now 30 
peters drug use became so bad he asked her to wake him by 
injecting him with cocaine she refused but stayed at his side 
telling herself he just needed help 
when police stormed her providence home in early 1985 debra 
learned about the murders all involving drug users or traffickers 
i tried to imagine him doing something like that she said 
i couldnt no matter how hard i tried 
authorities offered peter an unusual deal in exchange for his 
testimony he would serve his 10year sentence in providence police 
custody then be relocated the dream of starting over helped keep 
debra with her husband so did peters tales of threats against the 
family and prosecutors pleas he was a more believable witness with 
his wife by his side 
she sent her three older children to her mother in florida and 
she and 2yearold kiya were allowed to join peter in the police 
station 
the three lived together in a cell for a few weeks while a former 
matrons quarters was converted into a threeroom airconditioned 
apartment it had a telephone television videocassette recorder 
and queensized water bed but it was adjacent to the womens cells 
and the noise and screaming were incessant 
it was definitely our home said debra but it was like 
jail too i think i always felt like i was breathing germs 
peter passed the time watching tv sharing a beer with his 
guards fishing with the mayors chauffeur he started an 
autobiography he was allowed out and sometimes stayed away 
overnight 
debra was immobilied by fear afraid to go out she spent more 
time in jail than peter she began to fear the food might be 
poisoned and made her daughter wait while she tasted some first the 
strain finally proved too much and she moved back to florida 
i couldnt take it anymore the women screaming the officers 
my daughter was not going to be raised in that kind of 
environment she said 
two years later in 1988 she went back to peter at a rural rhode 
island safe house prosecutors provided debra said she told police 
that peter was using cocaine and packaging drugs in the cellar but 
was told to keep quiet a departmental review supports her 
allegation 
it can reasonably be inferred that gilbert supplemented his 
state income with his profits from narcotics sales the review 
said 
she stayed just seven weeks two months later peter who had a 
history of heart trouble died of a heart attack following a fight 
at a connecticut gas station according to a medical examiners 
report 
debra continues to wrestle with her husbands lies peter told 
the children he lived in the police station because he was an 
undercover officer she hasnt yet found a way to tell them the 
truth 
but she is hopeful about the future she recently remarried and 
insists this time she is less naive 
i have started a new life with a very good man she said 
its just a good feeling

a boxy apartmentoffice building on 
concrete stilts surmounts ruins of the 2000yearold roman temple 
of jupiter dramatizing the clash of old and new in this teeming 
ancient city 
a modern marbleclad temple of commerce with jewelry shops and 
clothing boutiques is next door opposite the ancient islamic 
medressah or school of nur eddin 
its a bad integration of the old and the new said nazih 
kawakibi a professor of architecture at damascus university who 
serves on several restoration committees they could have done it 
much better 
like many cities in the middle east damascus is bulging at the 
seams trying to provide housing and services to a population 
estimated at 2 million 
damascus is considered one of the worlds oldest continuously 
inhabited cities the arameans nomads from the arabian peninsula 
settled here in 1200 bc eventually building a city that became an 
important commercial center 
greeks romans byzantines arabs and ottomans have occupied 
damascus a treasure trove of monuments reflect the cultural tides 
that have swept over the city 
some ancient sites like the famed ummayyad mosque were 
venerated by all the occupiers 
the mosque site originally was a temple to haddad the aramean 
god of thunder and lightning 
it later became the roman temple of jupiter the byzantines built 
a cathedral there but the arabs transformed it into the mosque 
named for the islamic dynasty 
only limited resources are available to preserve the the ancient 
sites 
kawakibi pointed to the medressah just on the edge of a 
straight europeanstyle avenue cut through the city by french 
colonizers in the 1930s 
they stopped here they didnt go further thanks be to god 
said the architect who has devoted his life to preserving old 
damascus 
a 14th century tomb of the mamelukes has been rented to a cloth 
merchant who destroyed the original lintel and cut a door through 
an ancient wall to allow access to his shop 
unless we propose a solution to blend those monuments with the 
commercial life of the old city of damascus this is the way it all 
will go kawakibi said 
these buildings shouldnt function as commercial buildings but 
as museums or cultural centers theyre all registered as historical 
monuments but the law hasnt been able to prevent them from being 
transgressed 
in one old mosque the antique wooden minbar or preachers 
stand was ripped out and left in the entrance to be replaced by a 
concrete one 
an architectural gem the 11th century nur eddin hospital is 
sandwiched between a modern shop selling shwarma thinly sliced meat 
wrapped in arabic bread and a jewelry store it was restored in the 
late 1970s 
parasitic buildings accumulated around it but theyre now just 
part of the ambience said kawakibi who was instrumental in the 
renovation 
only one of the original stonelattice windows carved in 
intricate geometric designs had survived master craftsment copied 
it faithfully 
a few painted koranic inscriptions remained on the domed 
ceilings instead of repainting them restorers gently penciled in 
missing portions of the holy books text 
in a display case are ancient herbal medicines including one 
called aphrodisiac radish diuretic activates the functions of 
the genital glands 
the hospital and dozens of other old buildings are tranquil 
havens in a bustling noisy city as are the 11th century baths 
reached through a small door in the midst of the bazaar 
the baths saw hard times even becoming a soap factory at one 
point 
now men swaddled in towels sip at glasses of boilinghot tea 
after a searing bath and massage they read their newspapers beneath 
a dome painted with complicated flowery designs 
renovation is not always popular 
when youre trying to renovate these buildings theres a lot 
of protest because they dont understand what is meant by 
renovation kawakibi said they think you mean destroying the 
old buildings and putting up new ones 
at the masjid almadrassah alumariyah mosque and school complex 
which dates from the time of the first crusade in the 11th century 
dozens of squatters who built concrete huts on the grounds are being 
evicted 
in deciding how to proceed restorers rely on old drawings their 
knowledge of the architectural practices of the time and sometimes 
photographs from the 19th and early 20th centuries 
in the 1960s the government and experts drew up a master plan 
for the city which included providing modern services and 
preserving the old city it has become hopelessly outdated 
even a devoted restorationist like kawakibi acknowledges that 
attention should be paid to modern problems more than old ones we 
need infrastructure telephones transportation

a proapartheid candidate has 
made a surprisingly strong showing in a special parliamentary 
election widely seen as a referendum on president fw de klerks 
reforms 
in wednesdays vote held to fill a vacant seat in parliament 
from a workingclass district in durban ruling party candidate piet 
matthee defeated francis hitchcock of the proapartheid conservative 
party 
but the margin of victory 5762 to 5215 was far smaller than 
in last septembers white election when the candidate of the ruling 
national party outpolled the conservative candidate 6149 to 2429 
the conservatives said their performance improved because a 
growing number of whites are upset with de klerks plans to 
dismantle apartheid and negotiate a new constitution with black 
opposition groups 
de klerk has launched a series of reforms since assuming power in 
august he says he wants the countrys 5 million whites to share 
power with the 28 million blacks who currently have no voice in 
national affairs 
the conservatives oppose all concessions to blacks and want south 
africa divided into several separate states along racial lines 
they are the official opposition in the dominant white chamber of 
parliament with 39 seats the national party has 93 seats in the 
white chamber and the antiapartheid democratic party has 33 
the tricameral parliament also has houses for asians and people 
of mixedrace blacks vote only in local elections in segregated 
townships 
in septembers nationwide white elections the national party won 
48 percent the conservatives 31 percent and the democrats 21 
percent

prochoice republicans won a trio of platform 
victories at recent state party conventions and expect still more 
states to part ways with the national gops antiabortion plank this 
year 
republicans in maine and new york have adopted prochoice state 
platform provisions and wisconsin republicans voted down an 
antiabortion plank that would have called for legal protection 
for all human beings from conception on 
with the convention season just beginning more state parties 
will be taking up platform language or resolutions in coming weeks 
that depart from the national gops platform opposition to abortion 
the actions have the indirect blessing of national republicans 
as they test republican national chairman lee atwaters assertion 
that the party is a big tent with room for differing views on 
abortion 
the atwater theory is alive those views are being 
accommodated said leslie goodman spokeswoman for the republican 
national committee 
we of course are not involved at the state level in what 
their platforms look like but theres no question that abortion is 
now an issue thats being handled at the state level she said 
colorado republicans who meet this saturday are scheduled to 
face a series of proposed resolutions on abortion and leaders there 
expect some moderately prochoice language to prevail 
abortionrights advocates say they expect prochoice resolutions 
also will be offered at upcoming conventions in new jersey and other 
states 
these are very significant shifts in the party i think said 
mary dent crisp head of the national republican coalition for 
choice one of three national organizations of republicans who back 
abortion rights 
the bigtent theory was permission for the prochoice position 
and antichoice position to be sidebyside within the republican 
party said crisp who was rnc cochairwoman in the late 1970s 
ann stone a conservative activist who heads the group 
republicans for choice said the state actions demonstrate the 
current party platform is not consistent with the basic philosophy 
of republicans on abortion 
in the latest action wisconsin republicans voted down the 
proposed antiabortion plank at their state convention last saturday 
in milwaukee 
both sides claimed victory however because after rebuffing the 
antiabortion provision the delegates approved separate resolutions 
opposing abortion as a method of birth control or for the mothers 
convenience 
gop gov tommy g thompson who is seeking reelection said he 
took no part in the platform debate although he opposes abortion in 
most cases 
prochoice republicans won the day crisp said claiming a 
victory in wisconsin 
new york republicans last week approved an abortionrights plank 
without debate it says state government must not become a big 
brother regulating people in their personal affairs and lives 
although the measure was opposed by sen alfonse damato rny 
the conventions keynote speaker it was approved without debate 
in maine where republican gov john r mckernan jr and other 
top elected republicans support abortion rights delegates to the 
state convention in late april rejected an antiabortion amendment 
to the state platform 
they approved platform language saying we prefer to trust the 
personal integrity of the people of the state in making this very 
private decision rather than having it become a divisive political 
issue 
darla st martin associate executive director of the national 
right to life committee claimed victory in the wisconsin 
resolutions and said the new york action will backfire on gop 
candidates 
this is very bad for the republican party in new york because 
thats not whats going on elsewhere st martin said 
stones group is striving to have the 1992 gop national 
convention adopt new platform language supporting abortion rights 
or at least drop its current antiabortion plank 
the platform adopted at the 1988 republican national convention 
said the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life 
which cannot be infringed and called for a constitutional 
amendment banning abortion 
since then a supreme court ruling gave states far greater leeway 
to place restrictions on abortion and intensified political debate 
over the issue 
republicans lost races for governor of virginia and new jersey in 
1989 when their candidates were attacked for antiabortion views 
both sides of the abortion debate have claimed successes in 
primaries so far this year including in iowa on tuesday when 
democrats nominated an abortionrights advocate for governor

commercial bankers beset with souring real 
estate loans are seeking the same type of regulatory leniency that 
analysts say pushed savings and loan institutions deeper in trouble 
meeting in private at a washington hotel chief executives of 
some of the nations largest banks asked the federal reserve board 
to bend capital standards while they work off losses from sour real 
estate loans according to minutes of the session obtained by the 
associated press 
the 12member federal advisory council created by law to advise 
the central bank suggested at the may 3 meeting that regulators 
permit banks to deduct real estate loan losses from their earnings 
over a period of years rather than all at once 
it also asked for relaxed capital rules to permit banks to hold 
and manage repossessed real estate rather than have to sell it into 
a depressed market 
it would be constructive to include a more flexible approach to 
problem real estate assets the minutes said 
analysts denounced the suggestion pointing out that forbearance 
by sampl regulators allowed those institutions to disguise their true 
condition and run up their losses 
its deja vu all over again said robert litan of the 
brookings institution a washington think tank this was the story 
of the 1980s and the thrift crisis 
bert ely a financial institutions consultant in alexandria va 
said forbearance toward agricultural lenders during the farm crisis 
of the early 1980s worked out but was a gamble 
every time you do it youre taking a risk with the taxpayers 
money the problem is if it isnt done well we end up in another 
sampl mess ely said 
spreading out losses over a period of years improves the 
appearance of a banks balance sheet ely said but the thing is 
the losses are there and the earning power of the bank is impaired 
as a result ultimately its a charade 
litan said extended loss writeoffs allow banks to continue to 
pay dividends to stockholders but he added personally i dont 
think thats prudent when capital weakens they should husband 
every dollar of earnings they have and plow it back into the bank 
the federal reserve keeps the minutes of the councils sessions 
secret for three years but the ap obtained a copy after the 
discussion was disclosed in wednesday editions of usa today federal 
reserve spokesmen were reported out of their office wednesday and 
unavailable to respond to questions 
in a related development wednesday federal regulators assured 
members of congress that a government crackdown on bank lending is 
not the cause of a credit squeeze in some regions 
the officials appearing before the house small business 
committee conceded that some banks are making it more difficult for 
businesses to get loans particularly for commercial real estate 
projects 
but they said that is more a response to a sluggish economy than 
a reaction to intensified scrutiny from government examiners they 
said they have cautioned their examiners not to be overzealous in 
scrutinizing loans 
in general however the regulators stood firm in the face of 
complaints by lawmakers that creditworthy constituents were having 
trouble getting loans 
a slowdown in certain markets seems entirely warranted given 
current economic conditions said federal reserve board member 
john p laware 
in my view banks should be applauded for tightening lending 
standards said paul g fritts director of supervision for the 
federal deposit insurance corp 
he said regulators critics are confusing a normal credit 
contraction during a time of economic downturn with a credit crunch 
in which legitimate projects cannot attract financing 
however rep richard e neal dmass whose state has been 
among the hardest hit by a slump in real estate said regardless 
of whats been stated today a perception has been created that a 
curtain has been dropped over some of the entrepreneurship that 
weve witnessed in new england over the last decade 
del walter fauntroy ddc complained about scarcity of 
business loans in the nations capital 
some banks throttled their lending down so sharply that some 
members of the house banking committee began to fear a 
fullfledged credit crunch he said

two of jerome robbins finest ballets and another 
that audiences love made up the delightful varied program on the 
second night of the new york city ballets june 5 17 festival of 
jerome robbins ballets 
dances at a gathering performed wednesday at the new york 
state theater has been highly acclaimed by critics and an audience 
favorite since the company premiered it in 1969 to about an hour of 
chopin played by pianist jerry zimmerman 10 dancers take solos 
duets trios and multiple trios 
the ballet flows from one scene to another its plotless but 
relationships can be read into it the mood of much of it is 
friendly but there are also duets of gentle rapture 
among the 10 dancers we were most struck by darci kistler who 
enlivened scenes she appeared in and jock soto who has real stage 
presence 
robbins has dedicated this ballet to the memory of dance and 
broadway lighting designer jean rosenthal 
lighting is important to robbins and lighting in dances at a 
gathering and glass pieces was superb 
the 20minute glass pieces which robbins choreographed in 
1983 to music by philip glass is a sophisticated gem one of the 
most successful modern ballets 
the back wall looks like a big piece of graph paper fortythree 
dancers move in intricate purposeful precise formations it looks 
like wall street at lunch hour 
in the second of three pieces of music maria calegari and adam 
luders dance a duet center stage with a spotlight on them a line 
of dancers across the back of the stage in dim blue light moves in 
repeated unison figures we couldnt take our eyes off that linear 
movement as it echoed the hypnotic repeated short phrases of music 
the evening began with the brief circus polka igor 
stravinsky composed the music in 1942 at george balanchines 
instigation for the ringling brothers barnum and bailey circus 
robbins choreographed it for the new york city ballets 
stravinsky festival in 1972 with 54 baby ballerinas from the school 
of american ballet he was ringmaster snapping a whip to send rows 
of little girls into place and finally into forming stravinskys 
initials 
it was a sweet curtain raiser on wednesday with jeppe mydtskov 
as ringmaster

the 26 million spent by a toyota auto plant 
in kentucky to train 545 workers who did not qualify as needy is 
just one of many questionable expenses within federal job training 
programs labor department investigators say 
many of the workers at the scott county ky plant were working 
fulltime and therefore ineligible for the job training partnership 
act program the departments inspector generals office said in 
documents submitted to congress on wednesday 
but labor secretary elizabeth dole testifying before the 
documents were addressed said the 3 billionayear program has 
been remarkably free of fraud and abuse 
loopholes in federal law resulted in such examples as officials 
in portage wis spending 22000 of federal job training money on 
dinner cruises and christmas parties mrs dole told the house 
education and labor committee 
in that case officials put jobtraining advance funds in the 
bank and then spent the interest she said the senate has already 
passed a measure to clarify that interest earned on federal job 
training funds must be spent on job training she said 
other questionable expenses outlined by the inspector generals 
office included 
718768 spent by the houston job training partnership council 
for enrolling and training security guards at a cost of 3000 each 
the contractor billed for nearly 400 hours of training for each 
participant even though texas only requires 26 hours of training 
for registration as an armed security guard auditors said 
33801 paid to a subcontractor in michigan for placing college 
students in jobs they had found themselves or with employers for 
whom they had previously worked or in jobs in which the employers 
would have hired them without federal assistance 
640000 spent in louisiana to install a hightech training 
center at northwestern state university purchases included 
television cameras satellite disks and computers no dislocated 
workers were served the auditors found 
90155 for inflated placement claims at the full employment 
council of kansas city mo another 90000 was questioned because 
employers could not or would not provide payroll records to support 
onthejobtraining claims 
mrs dole said that of the thousands of private businessmen who 
have helped administer jtpa funds there have been only 24 
allegations of conflicts of interest 
we believe this is an impressive record she said 
the overall operation of the program has been remarkably free 
of instances of fraud abuse or other wrongdoing the labor 
secretary said however she said misuse of funds was inevitable 
in a program as large as jtpa which has received 21 billion since 
it was created seven years ago 
mrs dole who supports tougher recordkeeping requirements also 
called on congress to tighten eligibility requirements so the 
neediest cases would benefit from the program 
she said she backed narrowing the requirements so the program 
would be more focused on people who lacked basic skills those who 
are high school dropouts or those with disabilities 
we must target the tougher cases the ones who are not 
going to make it without our intervention mrs dole said

there are no plans for jane pauley to coanchor 
the nbc nightly news with tom brokaw nbc news president michael 
gartner says but hes not ruling out the possibility 
he specifically said we never say never network 
spokeswoman betty hudson told reporters in a briefing on gartners 
closeddoor presentation at the nbc affiliates convention wednesday 
nbc television president pier mapes emphasized that pauleys 
first priority is a series of primetime specials she also will do 
special reports for nightly and fill in for brokaw 
pauley left nbcs troubled today show in december after the 
network brought in deborah norville 
in an interview in julys issue of ladies home journal pauley 
insisted nbc was not trying to force her out but she said her 
husband doonesbury cartoonist garry trudeau was skeptical 
his initial reaction to nbcs handling of the whole thing was 
slash and burn pauley said in an interview i remember him 
telling someone that most people in my position would have left tire 
tracks on deborahs back 
but pauley said she admires the way norville has handled the 
controversy 
if it had been me getting all that criticism i would not have 
been functioning professionally she said i probably wouldnt 
have wanted to show my face

from 38 billion miles the earth is a blue dot 
in an ocean of black 
on that blue dot thats where everyone you know everyone you 
ever heard of every human being who ever lived lived out their 
life astronomer carl sagan said wednesday as nasa released an 
extraordinary photo taken from a vantage point in deep space 
voyager 1 speeding toward the edge of the solar system looked 
back in february and snapped photos of six of the nine planets that 
whirl around the sun 
the photograph actually a mosaic of 64 images taken in a 
fourhour period was the last from the spacecraft the pictures 
were recorded feb 1314 but were not played back to earth until 
late march because deepspace radio receivers were occupied with 
higher priority tasks 
the camera looked down from 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane 
the track in which most of the planets orbit the sun it captured 
neptune uranus saturn jupiter earth and venus 
mars was washed out by the sun mercury was too close to the sun 
to be photographed and pluto was too far away and too small to 
appear by happenstance earth was within a band of sunlight but 
sagan said it had no special significance 
the twin spacecraft voyager 1 and voyager 2 were launched in 
august and september 1977 from cape canaveral fla between them 
they explored all the giant outer planets of the solar system 48 of 
their moons and the systems of rings and magnetic fields of those 
planets 
edward stone of the california institute of technology chief 
scientist on the voyager project said he expected the voyagers to 
leave the solar system and cruise into interstellar space sometime 
between the years 2000 and 2010 voyager 1 is heading outward at a 
rate of nearly a million miles a day 
sagan was asked what had been learned from the voyagers that 
would change descriptions of the solar system published in 
encyclopedias in 1975 
i would say you would simply tear them up he replied the 
knowledge gained from the space probes have wholly changed our 
knowledge of the solar system 
stone said the greatest discovery was that io a moon circling 
jupiter had active volcanoes the first such discovery on another 
body in the solar system the voyagers together observed nine 
volcanic eruptions on io 
he showed reporters timelapse pictures that showed graphically 
that other storms meld into jupiters great red spot and that 
storms circle the planet moving in opposite directions 
voyager showed that uranus a planet tipped on its side also has 
a previously undiscovered magnetic field that is tilted 60 degrees 
from the planets axis of rotation 
sagan recalled that the first successful planetary mission 
occurred when mariner 2 flew past venus in 1962 
in 27 years the human species has flown close by or landed on 
every planet in the solar system except pluto he said still 
we have no evidence not a smidgen of evidence suggesting life 
anywhere else

the gentle revolution that 
overturned communist rule in czechoslovakia has given way to fierce 
and devious campaigning for fridays elections the countrys first 
free vote in 44 years 
rising nationalism in slovakia and the shadow cast by the 
communist past have combined to revive the passion and wit that 
characterized last falls revolt election posters are everywhere on 
city streets 
but the gentle camaraderie of that time is less evident replaced 
by intrigue and infighting as politicians and parties battle for 
votes and power 
the civic forum movement founded by president vaclav havel and 
its slovak partner in the revolution public against violence seem 
certain to emerge as the strongest force nationwide 
but the broadbased movements that have dominated government 
since the revolution could fall short of an absolute majority and be 
forced to share power in a new coalition 
the latest preelection polls gave civic forum and the public 
against violence 39 to 42 percent of the vote nationwide their 
strongest rival the christian democrats showed a distant second 
with 13 to 15 percent although stronger about 25 percent in 
slovakia the more rural of czechoslovakias two republics 
the christian democrats chances were dealt a further blow 
wednesday an unprecedented public denunciation of one of their top 
candidates by the deputy interior minister investigating the now 
disbanded communist secret police 
josef bartoncik chairman of one of the three parties in the 
christian democrat coalition repeatedly has been accused of being a 
secret police informer a charge he denies 
but deputy interior minister jan ruml said on national television 
that he had unspecified damaging information on bartoncik whom he 
accused of breaking a pledge to quit national politics 
the communists who are third in the opinion polls seem likely 
to suffer from wednesdays wellpublicized roundup of at least seven 
former party leaders widely blamed for the 21 years of repressive 
communist rule after the 1968 invasion that crushed the prague 
spring reforms 
the roundup appeared well timed by civic forum to remind voters 
of the horrors of communist rule and reap the benefit when polls 
open friday at 2 pm some 111 million people are entitled to cast 
ballots for a new 200seat bicameral federal parliament and the two 
regional parliaments in the czech and slovak republics voting will 
continue until 11 pm friday resume early saturday and end at 2 
pm that day with the first predictions expected saturday 
afternoon and final results sunday 
any of the 22 parties contesting the elections will have to get 
at least 5 percent of the vote to have a chance of winning seats 
which will be allotted in proportion to the total vote received in 
the countrys 12 electoral districts 
havel who by tradition is supposed to be nonpartisan as 
president has openly campaigned for civic forum and its slovak 
allies drawing fire from christian democrats in slovakia who say he 
has exploited his authority huge popularity and media coverage to 
give an unfair advantage to his friends 
in a nationally televised speech tuesday the 
playwrightturnedpolitician appealed to czechoslovaks to vote for 
former dissidents like himself who proved their opposition to 
communism in years of lonely political struggle 
the current government includes some reformed or former 
communists whose presence is strongly criticized by the christian 
democrats who hope to emulate the election success of centerright 
parties in east germany and hungary 
both the civic forum and the christian democrats have ruled out a 
coalition with the communists who are predicted to get about 10 
percent of the vote that expected 10 percent is a reflection of the 
traditional strength of socialism in czechoslovakia and the 
reluctance of some to embark on the tough road to a market economy 
making that change and dealing with growing separatist tendencies 
in slovakia will be the chief problems facing any new government 
havel is virtually certain to be confirmed as president by the 
new parliament whose chief task in its twoyear term is to remake 
czechoslovakias constitution 
that will confront deputies with the slovaks demands for a 
loose federal alliance to replace the current federation of czech 
and slovak republics created by the communists in 1968 
eventually many slovaks would like to see a separate slovak 
state in a united europe

democrats on the senate agriculture committee 
say legislation to halt export of pesticides that cant be sold in 
the united states will help american farmers 
by stopping the export of banned and unregistered pesticides 
we will level the playing field for our producers said sen 
patrick leahy dvt chairman of the committee both domestic and 
foreign farmers will be treated the same 
the committee inserted the ban wednesday in its version of the 
1990 farm bill under protest from ranking republican sen richard 
lugar of indiana and other gop members on the committee 
lugar said he didnt think the provision belonged in the 
legislation that establishes the governments agricultural policy 
for the next five years 
sen christopher bond rmo said the legislation could lead to 
loss of jobs at chemical companies that may decide to do their 
manufacturing abroad 
he also said if we phase companies out it would take other 
companies very little time to gear up 
jay vroom president of the national agricultural chemicals 
association said his organization would continue to try to get the 
committee to change certain provisions of the bill 
he said proposed restrictions on experimentation with chemicals 
would be detrimental to us scientific discovery 
we could be shooting ourselves in the foot vroom said 
some companies will move research plants to europe where the 
likelihood is better of moving products around the world unfettered 
during experimentation on crops 
he said many of the unregistered chemicals sold abroad that would 
be banned from export are awaiting approval by the environmental 
protection agency which has a backlog thus they could eventually 
be registered here he said 
other chemicals dont pass the zero tolerance laws in the united 
states for residue but do pass pesticide regulations in other 
countries vroom said 
leahy said that no part of the farm bill generated more mail to 
his office than this one 
at a time when we are toughening our standards at home we need 
to do more about imports with hazardous pesticides he said 
because the food and drug administration waives through virtually 
all imported food without inspection these chemicals often end up 
on americas dinner tables 
about 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the 
united states come from abroad 
many of the chemicals that have been banned for health reasons 
were quite effective in eliminating pests and increasing crop yields 
foreign farmers are able to use madeintheusa chemicals that 
our farmers cannot said leahy we effectively penalize us 
farmers and growers for using safe pesticides and obeying the law

us food processors and processingequipment 
makers took a few steps closer to converting the soviet union to the 
capitalistic system during a conference this week 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher signed an agreement wednesday 
with the soviet union that promises that federal officials will work 
with the soviets to find ways to adapt the us food making and 
distribution system to their country 
vladilen nikitin the soviet equivalent to the us agriculture 
secretary said the agreement was a small step but everything 
starts with a small step 
for you its a key if you want to participate in the 
strengthening of our economy he said through an interpreter 
the pact was signed on the last day of a threeday conference 
sponsored by the food processing machinery amp supplies association 
and the national food processors association 
mosbacher said the pact was unprecedented and a start toward 
expanding trade between the two superpowers 
we are the two largest industrialized nations in the world 
said mosbacher we have onethird of the worlds gnp gross 
national product but we do only a tiny fraction of world trade 
john cady president of the food processors association said 
barriers are beginning to come down although americans are 
concerned about getting paid for business with the soviets 
soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market 
leaving those companies doing business in the soviet union to either 
accept products in exchange or wait for longterm gains after the 
economy there improves 
we have to understand when companies invest its not going to 
be a threeyear turnaround but probably eight to 10 years said 
cady 
he said nikitin was a powerful official in the soviet government 
and would smooth the way for american business 
us businessmen at the conference had complained earlier of 
complications in dealing with the soviet bureaucracy

sen wyche fowler dga wants to put his 
agricultural marketing reform legislation into the 1990 farm bill 
the measure would modify the agriculture departments grading 
standards of fruit and vegetables by including flavor sugar content 
and nutritional value as grading criteria 
the current system of some produce relies solely on its exterior 
appearance with no regard for the quality of the fruit or vegetable 
fowler said 
sometimes pesticides are used to enhance the looks of produce 
when external appearance is irrelevant such as in fruits or 
vegetables used by juice makers 
both consumers and farmers will benefit from this amendment 
fowler said wednesday consumers will be eating healthier food 
with less pesticides and farmers will be reducing their costs by 
spending less money on pesticides

industrial plants released more than 13 
billion pounds of chemicals suspected or known to be linked to birth 
defects in 1988 with the largest amount coming from the 
petrochemical belt of texas an environmental group said today 
citizen action said it analyzed computerized data from the 
environmental protection agency to determine what regions of the 
country had the most hazardous chemical pollution 
industrial facilities emitted more than 46 billion pounds of 
hazardous chemicals into the air water and onto the ground in 1988 
about half of it into the air according to epa figures released 
earlier this year 
the analysis by citizen action based on the same epa statistics 
showed that nearly onethird of the chemicals released about 13 
billion pounds have either been shown to cause birth defects or 
are strongly suspected to have such a link most of these releases 
were into the air 
the epa has cautioned against using the raw data to determine 
health risks because the statistics doe not take into account such 
factors as dosage and actual exposure the data which is required 
to be submitted by industry reflects the amount released from a 
factory over a years period 
a large percentage of the releases cited by citizen action 
involved industrial solvents such as tuluene and xylene which 
medical experts say could pose health problems if a person is 
chronically exposed or exposed to large amounts 
according to citizen action about 17 percent of the total 
releases linked to birth defects come from 10 companies many of 
which have factories in various parts of the country 
the 3m corp which has been touted by the bush administration 
for having innovative pollutioncontrol measures ranked as the 
company with the most releases of chemicals linked to birth defects 
total releases for the company were put at nearly 53 million 
pounds with a 3m plant in hutchinson minn reporting releases of 
16 million pounds mainly industrial solvents 
general motors corp ranked second releasing nearly 41 million 
pounds from plants around the country it was followed by avtex 
fibers inc front royal va with 34 million pounds the avtex 
plant closed last year after a lengthy dispute over pollution with 
virginia state officials 
rick renner a spokesman for 3m in minneapolis said the company 
has a program under way aimed at cutting toxic emissions by 90 
percent by the end of the decade and that new emission control 
equipment is being installed at the hutchinson plant our 
emissions will be down substantially this year he said 
after texas the states in 1988 with the most releases of 
chemicals shown or suspected to cause birth defects were ohio 
indiana illinois virginia pennsylvania michigan tennessee 
california and new york with the avtex plant closed virginia no 
longer would be among these states 
the 10 counties in 1988 with the highest releases of chemicals 
linked to birth defects were warren the virginia location of the 
now closed avtex plant los angeles california cook illinois 
harris texas hamblen tennessee mcleod minnesota wayne 
michigan jefferson louisiana middlesex new jersey and 
jefferson texas

a 1970 law that allows competing newspapers to 
merge their business operations is fattening publishers wallets but 
eroding press freedom and the quality of the nations journalism a 
republican congressman says 
it seems ironic that some of the very voices which call for 
free market forces to work in other industries seek government 
protection for creating monopolies in their own said rep carl 
pursell on michigan 
pursell introduced a bill wednesday to repeal the newspaper 
preservation act which allows newspapers in the same city to 
operate as a single business entity while maintaining separate news 
and editorial staffs 
the bill would not affect the partial mergers already in place 
but it would prohibit similar arrangements known as joint 
operating agreements or joas in the future 
leaders of citizens for an independent press a national 
coalition of small newspaper publishers business and civic leaders 
endorsed pursells bill they accused the large newspapers that have 
entered into joas of sacrificing principle for profit 
these crybaby billionaires have for many years enjoyed one of 
the biggest and most enduring specialinterest giveaways in american 
history said bruce b brugmann editor and publisher of the san 
francisco bay guardian a weekly newspaper 
pursell said he once favored the law but changed his mind after 
seeing results of last years joa between the detroit free press and 
the detroit news he said he also was bothered by the fact that joas 
are subject to approval by the us attorney general since they 
grant exemptions to antitrust laws 
newspapers which seek joas are put in a compromising position 
of being dependent on the federal government for their survival 
he said how can such newspapers truly fulfill their watchdog 
role 
newspapers in 19 cities were operating under joas last year 
attorney general dick thornburgh approved two others in las vegas 
and york pa this year 
since the detroit joa took effect last november the free press 
and the news have devoted less space to news and more to 
advertisements pursell said 
i think theyre losing readership he said as i go around 
my district most of the readers i hear feel that the newspapers 
have declined in terms of news 
joseph ungaro president and chief executive officer of the 
detroit newspaper agency which administers the detroit joa said 
the arrangement has been successful despite some early delivery 
problems and a circulation decline for the news 
the free press daily circulation was 629275 in march 1989 and 
rose to 639767 by march 1990 ungaro said 
the news circulation fell from 693943 in march 1989 to 526147 
in march 1990 largely because of a decision to scale back 
circulation outside the detroit area and to make the news an 
afternoon paper instead of retaining most of the previous morning 
editions ungaro said 
id have to say that the readers are voting with their 
pocketbooks every day by buying the product he said 
ungaro said the only alternative to joas is the loss of some of 
the nations oldest and best newspapers knightridder which owns 
the free press had indicated it would close the moneylosing 
newspaper if the joa were denied 
is one paper with a monopoly better than two voices in the 
community i dont think so ungaro said 
the supreme court upheld former attorney general edwin meeses 
approval of the detroit joa on a 44 vote last year

the b2 stealth bomber is 69 feet long 17 feet 
high and has a wingspan of 172 feet but on a soviet radar monitor 
the aircraft would appear to be an object no bigger than an insect 
the air force on wednesday revealed the bombers radar cross 
section as it continued its campaign to bolster diminishing 
congressional support for the batwinged aircraft priced at 815 
million each 
the b2s significantly reduced radar cross section minimizes 
the detectability of the b2 to the point it can operate with 
virtual impunity the air force said in one of three detailed 
reports 
in testimony to a senate armed services subcommittee air force 
secretary donald rice and chief of staff gen larry d welch 
unveiled the reports to support arguments for the bomber 
manufactured by the northrop corp 
an unclassified page in one report describing typical radar cross 
sections compared ships aircraft birds and three insects the 
bluewinged locust the honeybee and the alfalfa caterpillar 
butterfly 
pressed to categorize the bomber welch responded its in the 
insect category he refused to elaborate 
the air force has repeatedly said the b2 is not invisible and 
there are systems that sometimes can detect the aircraft but welch 
said the small cross section the aircraft would occupy on a radar 
screen would enhance its ability to operate without detection in 
soviet air space 
rice assured the senate panel that if the plane fails low 
observability tests scheduled to begin this fall he would 
reconsider the program 
defense secretary dick cheney citing both a diminished soviet 
threat to the west and budget pressures proposed on april 27 
cutting the planned total b2 purchase from 132 to 75 
in the 303 billion defense budget for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 cheney cut the number of stealths to be bought from five to 
two 
sen james exon dneb chairman of the senate subcommittee on 
strategic forces and nuclear deterrence heralded the testimony from 
welch and rice as crucial to the continuation of the b2 bomber 
program 
the senate panel is expected to begin crafting a fiscal 1991 
defense bill later this month 
but exon a b2 supporter immediately expressed frustration when 
rice could not provide specific information on the reduced cost of 
the program in fiscal 1991 with the reduction in planned purchases 
its six weeks since the secretary himself indicated the 
reduced buy exon said just not getting the information up to 
us indicates to me that there must be a lot of unanswered questions 
on the bottom side of that balance sheet over there 
pressed by other lawmakers rice said the program in fiscal 1991 
would cost about 45 billion some 900 million less than 
originally proposed he was unable to provide specifics on military 
construction costs spare parts advanced procurement and research 
and development 
the air force secretary added that the overall cost of the b2 
program would likely be slightly higher than the 611 billion 
cheney estimated when the planned acquisition was reduced rice 
estimated 62 billion for a fleet of 75 planes

the justice department opposes congressional 
proposals aimed at eliminating lengthy delays of death penalty 
appeals 
a house plan would have the reverse effect of stringing out the 
appeal process and a senate plan has technical defects deputy 
assistant attorney general paul l maloney told a house panel 
wednesday 
the senate plan cosponsored by sens arlen specter rpa and 
strom thurmond rsc is designed to shorten death penalty delays 
by replacing state habeas corpus proceedings with a single federal 
court review 
habeas corpus proceedings are used by defendants who have been 
sentenced to death and are trying to win new trials or sentences 
the specterthurmond amendment was defeated then passed 12 hours 
later on may 24 allowing it to be added to a comprehensive senate 
anticrime bill 
the amendment would require federal habeas corpus petitions to be 
filed within 60 days after final action by state courts 
the amendment raises interesting possibilities for reducing 
appeals delays through a stronger more comprehensive system of 
time limitation rules maloney told a house judiciary subcommittee 
but he added we do find that there are some defects some 
technical problems if you will under questioning he said the 
amendment was still under review and that he was not prepared to 
specify what the problems were 
the two proposals are among several under consideration in 
congress to speed up death penalty appeals while ensuring 
defendants rights 
the house plan sponsored by rep robert kastenmeier dwis 
would give death row inmates new appeal rights while ensuring that 
their attorneys met strict experience and performance standards 
the bill also aims to end appeals delays by restricting multiple 
prisoner petitions and establishing a oneyear limit within for 
inmates to file for federal habeas relief 
but maloney said the measure multiplies the opportunity for 
delay and abuse in capital cases 
he quoted retired supreme court justice lewis f powell who said 
recently that a vote for kastenmeiers bill would in practical 
effect be a vote to eliminate capital punishment in the united 
states 
the department would recommend that president bush veto the bill 
if it passed congress in its present form maloney said 
but the bill was backed during wednesdays hearing by civil 
rights leader joseph lowery president of the southern christian 
leadership conference he said a broader supervisory role by the 
federal judiciary was needed to stop the inexhaustible litany of 
racial discrimination cases in the courts in the rural south

the bush administration says it opposes a 
senate bill that would reimpose some local rate regulation on the 
cable tv industry 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher in a letter to sen ernest 
f hollings dsc and john danforth rmo said the 
administration believes that competition not regulation is the 
best way to benefit the public and cable tv companies 
the letter was made public wednesday 
congress in 1984 essentially lifted all regulation of the cable 
tv industry effective at the beginning of 1986 since that time 
cable rates have risen sharply amid complaints of poor service 
the cable industry maintains that it has gone through a period of 
growing pains in the wake of deregulation and that rates are 
stabilizing and service is improving 
but members of congress stung by constituent complaints 
increasingly have been in a mood to restore regulatory supervision

two major manufacturers of hair dryers have 
eliminated the danger of electrocution when their products fall into 
water says the consumer product safety commission 
the new hair dryers solve a problem which has plagued the 
industry since the early 1980s when an estimated 17 electrocutions 
annually were caused by handheld hair dryers falling into tubs and 
other water the commission said wednesday 
approximately 10 of these deaths were to children under 10 years 
of age the agency said 
youve got people that are drying their hair that have just 
come out of the shower whove got wet feet hands and hair said 
dick bruno vice president of marketing for windmere corp of miami 
the nations largest hair dryer manufacturer 
we wanted to take a position of providing the technology that 
was available he added 
windmeres new guardian esp hair dryers and curling iron and 
brush incorporate the new safety feature the classics protection 
plus hair dryer made by conair corp of stamford conn also 
includes the new safety feature 
the new dryers have rectangularshaped plugs with a reset button 
at the end of the cords 
a device called an appliance leakage current interrupter is built 
into the plug this detects any change in the electric current in 
the dryer within a fraction of a second and shuts the appliance off 
the new products offer protection against electrocution whether 
their switches are in the on or off position 
hair dryers manufactured since oct 1 1987 need only protect 
against electrocution if they fall into water with the switch in the 
off position the new dryers meet a new voluntary safety 
standard that becomes effective jan 1 1991

it took less than a day for a house republican 
to enlist the support of more than 80 colleagues for his drive to 
have a special prosecutor appointed to investigate the savings and 
loan crisis 
theres a real sense around here that the public deserves some 
answers rep peter smith of vermont said wednesday in an 
interview this is far and away the worst financial scandal in 
the history of this country 
smith said response to his proposal from fellow legislators has 
been very positive on a bipartisan basis although a justice 
department spokesman called the move unnecessary 
smiths resolution which would have no binding legal effect 
calls on president bush to instruct attorney general dick thornburgh 
to appoint a special prosecutor known officially as an independent 
counsel to investigate the involvement of government officials in 
the savings and loan scandal 
eightyfive congressmen from both parties had signed the 
resolution by late wednesday said smiths press secretary liz 
nicolson 
some legislators have charged that federal thrift regulators were 
lax in oversight of the industry five senators have themselves been 
accused of improper conduct in connection with the collapse of 
lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
smith first floated the idea of a special prosecutor for the sampl 
crisis in a brief littlenoticed speech on the floor of the house 
on may 24 
his resolution is the first public proposal for an independent 
counsel to investigate the debacle which will cost us taxpayers 
around 325 billion to cover losses to depositors of failed thrifts 
if passed in its present form the resolution wouldnt trigger 
the provisions of the independent counsel law which requires the 
justice department to review such requests under certain conditions 
in order to be mandatory under the law the request for a special 
prosecutor would have to come from a majority of democrats or 
republicans on the house or senate judiciary committees 
independent counsels were called in most notably to investigate 
the irancontra and watergate scandals the most recent appointment 
of a special prosecutor was to investigate allegations of fraud and 
abuse at the department of housing and urban development 
smiths proposal sounds to me like its a little off the 
mark said justice department spokesman doug tillett he said 
special prosecutors who are separate from the department normally 
investigate highranking individuals in the executive branch who are 
suspected of wrongdoing 
in the savings and loan case the allegations concern members of 
congress and individuals outside washington tillett noted 
i dont think we would have any problems prosecuting those 
people he said we ought to be able to pursue those cases 
pretty well on our own without calling in a special prosecutor 
several democratic legislators have accused the justice 
department of dragging its feet in prosecuting sampl fraud cases 
about 200 house democrats recently signed a letter asking bush to 
seek additional money for the department to pursue the cases

for decades checkpoint charlie has been the 
bestknown crossing through the nowcrumbling berlin wall a site of 
demonstrations against hardline east german communist leaders and 
daring dashes to freedom 
on wednesday the us military announced that the cold war 
symbol a small building in the middle of a roadway will soon be 
dismantled 
until last years peaceful revolution in east germany people 
seeking the release of relatives barred from joining them in the 
west held demonstrations at the checkpoint some holding up protest 
signs for weeks 
frequently east german guards photographed anyone they found 
suspicious 
the checkpoint provided millions of visitors with the feeling 
they were witnessing something truly dangerous 
you are leaving the american sector reads a bold sign at 
checkpoint charlie the warning is repeated in french and russian 
tourists would simply strode by the checkpoint to the east german 
control stations 66 feet across the boundary line 
in a drab building at the east german outpost sternfaced guards 
would scrutinize passports 
the clanging metal doors opened by buzzers and the 
ceilingmounted mirrors that let communist guards check right down 
to peoples feet were a chilling reminder of the differences between 
east and west 
the crossing itself was designed for use by nongermans 
occasionally brave or foolhardy east germans tried to flee 
through the maze of concrete and steel barriers set up by the 
communists 
usually east german guards or bullets stopped them sometimes it 
worked 
in january 1986 east berlin construction worker andreas bratke 
made what must have seemed the longest dash of his 23 years 
sprinting through checkpoint charlie and into the west 
eight months later hansjoachim pofahl piled his girlfriend and 
her infant daughter into the front of a loaded gravel truck and 
barreled through the crossing and into the west in a blaze of 
communist gunfire 
abutting the western side of the crossing is the haus am 
checkpoint charlie museum rooms crammed with cars and other means 
used in daredevil escapes photographs document escapes by east 
germans over the berlin wall which was built in august 1961 to stem 
a westward exodus 
other crossings existed but checkpoint charlie was no 1 in the 
publics imagination the crossing that became famous the world over 
when the berlin wall was opened on nov 9 ecstatic east germans 
ran drove and shoved through checkpoint charlie on their way to the 
west for many the first time in their lives 
despite the changes troops of world war ii allies france 
britain and the united states have continued to man the checkpoint 
east germans have also continued to check those entering and 
leaving east berlin and have not said what they will do with their 
buildings 
but the economic and monetary union of the two germanys is due on 
july 1 and all border checks are to end in less than a month

the state that started the nations tax revolt 
12 years ago is taking down the barricades californians have voted 
to double their gasoline tax and raise billions for mass transit 
schools and the poor 
fearful of ever growing traffic jams and eventual automotive 
gridlock california voters agreed to shoulder an average of 60 a 
year per motorist in new taxes and approved proposition 111 by a 
52to48 percent margin tuesday 
under the measure the state gas tax will go from 9 to 18 cents 
per gallon raising 155 billion for a 10year freeway building and 
improvement program 
in total dollars its the largest tax increase in california 
history 
the measure came more than a decade after californias 
proposition 13 started the national tax revolt conservatives in a 
dozen other states tried to copy california and at least half 
succeeded the tax revolt also was credited with helping establish 
the political climate that got ronald reagan elected in 1980 
the chief sponsor of proposition 111 conservative republican 
gov george deukmejian insists it was not an assault on the tax 
revolt movement because it was a specific tax for a specific purpose 
relief of traffic congestion 
there is no evidence in these results whatsoever to indicate 
that the public will now be supportive of a general tax increase 
where the revenues would go into the general fund for the purpose of 
expanding the size or scope of government he said wednesday 
if theres a lesson to be learned from this its that the 
public will support a specific increase in revenues provided they 
know exactly where that money is going to go i dont see any other 
lesson to be learned as a result of this vote on proposition 111 
but others see the california vote quite differently 
it really does end the tax revolt in california and sends a 
message to washington which i dislike intensely said conservative 
economist arthur laffer who helped win approval of the twin 
foundations of the california tax revolt the property taxslashing 
proposition 13 in 1978 and a lid on government spending the next 
year 
in fact despite deukmejians words proposition 111 does far 
more than raise taxes for highways and mass transit it also eases 
the spending limit initiatives 
us secretary of transportation samuel k skinner said he was 
delighted with the vote he said it validates the bush 
adminstrations argument that voters are willing to raise taxes for 
highways and other transportation needs 
californias gas tax ranks 47th in the nation well below the 
national average of 158 cents a gallon if other states taxes stay 
the same california will rank 23rd after proposition 111 goes into 
full effect in five years 
proposition 111 was extremely popular in freewaylaced cities but 
soundly rejected in the most rural regions 
supporters said the economy environment and quality of life were 
at stake in the vote and the campaign played off the dramatic 
demonstration of the need for freeway improvements in the wake of 
recent california earthquakes 
voters also passed two bond measures one a companion to 
proposition 111 and the other sponsored by environmentalists that 
will together provide nearly 3 billion for masstransit rail 
construction throughout the state 
the ballot carried five other bond measures the most bond 
funding for a single election in california history and voters 
approved them all they provide 150 million to house the homeless 
and 2 billion to build prisons make government buildings safer and 
upgrade schools and universities 
the impetus for passage of the gasoline tax and rail bonds was 
the growing congestion on californias freeways californias 
population has been increasing about 10 times faster than the 
capacity of its highways 
as a result the average freeway speed during rush hour has 
dropped in los angeles and other urban areas to about 20 mph 
deukmejian maintained that was costing californians millions of 
dollars annually in wasted fuel and million of hours in wasted time

dr jack kevorkians suicide machine has 
confronted michigan legal authorities and lawmakers with the 
possibility their state will become a haven for deathbychoice 
kevorkian a retired pathologist said he did nothing illegal 
when janet adkins used his buttonoperated device to take her life 
monday in his van 40 miles from detroit 
alexander capron professor of law and medicine at the university 
of southern california and chairman of congress biomedical ethics 
advisory committee said wednesday that michigan may have no legal 
means to stop kevorkian from helping someone else die 
if the state decides that its present law doesnt prohibit 
this the legislature will have to decide whether they want michigan 
to be the place that people come to get kevorkianed said capron 
attorney general frank kelley acknowledged the laws of his state 
left kevorkians status unclear but said the doctor could become a 
test case 
because of where mrs adkins died the case is in the hands of 
oakland county prosecutor richard thompson who said a decision on 
whether to charge kevorkian might not be made for up to two months 
thompson did however request a temporary restraining order 
preventing further use of kevorkians device in the county circuit 
judge alice gilbert refused wednesday to grant that request but set 
a hearing for friday 
adkins a 54yearold alzheimers victim from portland ore 
died after kevorkian attached her to his device and she pushed a 
button to inject herself with lethal drugs 
had adkins used the device in her home state kevorkian could 
have gone to prison for 18 months or longer under a 1981 law 
helping someone commit suicide in oregon is manslaughter said phil 
lemman spokesman for the state department of justice 
prosecutors cited two precedents in michigan that could influence 
the kevorkian case 
in 1920 the state supreme court upheld the murder conviction of 
man who placed a bottle of poison within reach of his wife who 
wanted to commit suicide thompson said but the state court of 
appeals decided in 1983 that a man who gave a gun to a friend who 
used it to commit suicide shouldnt have been charged he said 
the appeals court said the high court in 1920 had gone too far in 
extending responsibility for murder to a second party said james 
shonkwiler executive director of the prosecuting attorneys 
association of michigan 
murder by statute requires that the actor the accused is 
the instrument the cause of death he said theres an 
intervening step when the victim acts of his own free will 
it is by no means clear that dr kevorkian committed a crime 
shonkwiler said you have to reach to get to that the question 
is whose will prevailed in the case his or the patients thats 
not clear

resident being tried for espionage in west germany a former us 
soldier has been sentenced to life in prison for passing nato 
secrets to the east over a decade

1st class clyde lee conrad 43 of treason on wednesday 
it found that the sebring ohio native had passed classified 
material to the hungarian and czechoslovak secret services from 1975 
through 1985 and received about 12 million for his efforts 
chief judge ferdinand schuth said the former sergeant 
endangered the entire defense capability of the west in reading 
the judgment the judge said conrads motive for spying was pure 
greed 
he said had war broken out the information conrad passed to the 
thensoviet bloc countries could have led to a breakdown in the 
defenses of the western alliance and to capitulation and the 
use of nuclear weapons on german territory 
schuth sentenced conrad to life imprisoment for spying for the 
hungarians he said conrad was also guilty of spying for 
czechoslovakia on a lesser scale and sentenced him to four years in 
prison on that charge 
conrad had been in charge of the 8th infantrys classified 
document center documents he had access to included nato strategic 
war plans and other highly sensitive information the prosecution in 
the trial which began jan 18 said conrad planned to continue 
spying for the hungarians even after his discharge 
maj robin higgins a spokeswoman for the pentagon in washington 
said she was unaware of the sentence and that the department would 
have no immediate comment 
abc news reported wednesday that authorities were investigating 
another former us army sergeant roderick ramsay in connection 
with the conrad case it said conrad had recruited ramsay into the 
spy ring when both were stationed at the 8th infantry division in 
bad krueznach 50 miles west of frankfurt 
the report which quoted unidentified us sources said ramsay 
had been talking with the fbi it said the espionage ring had among 
other things smuggled computer parts from the united states to the 
east bloc via canada 
conrad was arrested aug 23 1988 on suspicion of heading a west 
germanbased spy ring with eastern contacts in sweden and vienna 
austria 
he had spent 20 years in the army returing in september 1985 
and had lived in west germany since his discharge 
except for a period from september 1979 to november 1980 when he 
was based in the united states conrad served with the 8th infantry 
in west germany from 1975 until his discharge he was in charge of 
the classified document center during the majority of his time with 
the unit 
according to court records conrad was introduced to the 
hungarian secret service in late autumn of 1975 by his supervisor in 
the 8th infantry division former us army sgt 1st class zoltan 
szabo 
szabo who was convicted of espionage in austria in 1989 
received a 10month suspended sentence he identified for 
investigators some of the documents the court said conrad sold to 
the hungarians 
szabo provided the information against conrad in a sworn 
statement to the court and did not come to west germany for the 
trial 
two hungarians sandor kercsik and his brother imre were 
described by the court as conrads main contacts 
the two were arrested in 1988 in sweden and admitted to being 
agents of the hungarian secret police they were sentenced to 18 
months in prison for possessing nato defense material 
the kercsik brothers also provided statements to the rhineland 
palatinate state court with evidence implicating conrad

nearly 4000 soviet jews are living on land 
israel seized from jordan in 1967 despite israeli statements that 
the soviet jewish presence on occupied territory is minuscule 
still a survey completed wednesday indicated that the scope of 
the immigration to the occupied west bank and arab east jerusalem is 
far short of the mass influx feared by arab states 
movement to those areas constitutes only a small percentage of 
the 51700 jews who have arrived since the soviet union liberalized 
its emigration policies in the spring of 1989 
the israeli government said this week that just 318 soviet 
immigrants have moved into the west bank seized from jordan in the 
1967 middle east war 
but the survey by the associated press indicated that in addition 
to those on the west bank more than 3400 soviets have moved to 
five suburbs of arab east jerusalem since 1989 
although israel took east jerusalem from jordan in the 1967 war 
it annexed it and does not consider the suburbs occupied territory 
the issue of settling soviet jews on land captured in the 1967 
war has become critical to the future flow of immigrants projected 
to reach 20000 a month this year 
in response to pressure from arab states soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev last weekend threatened to limit exit permits 
for soviet jews if israel does not heed appeals to keep jews from 
the occupied areas 
but the soviet union appears to have retracted that threat a 
senior us official said on condition of anonymity wednesday the 
official said soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze had 
told secretary of state james a baker iii that soviet emigration 
policy would not be altered 
israels government says it has no policy of settling soviet jews 
on occupied territory but foreign minister moshe arens told 
parliament on wednesday that the new immigrants are free to settle 
wherever they want including the occupied lands 
arab leaders contend the flood of soviet immigrants could 
ultimately displace the 17 million palestinians who live in east 
jerusalem the west bank and gaza strip they say it might undercut 
palestinian efforts to form an independent state 
to date prime minister yitzhak shamirs rightwing government 
has given only figures for jews living in the west bank and gaza 
strip they say 10 percent have settled in jerusalem but refuse to 
give figures for how many are moving to annexed areas of the 
disputed capital 
the israeli absorption ministry said this week that 318 soviet 
immigrants have moved to the west bank joining the 70000 jewish 
settlers no soviet jews are known to be living in the gaza strip 
spot checks of settlements in the west bank indicated the 
government figure was accurate but the ap survey found 1140 new 
soviet immigrant families registered and received services at 
neighborhood community centers in five suburbs of arab east 
jerusalem in little more than a year 
based on government estimates that there are three to four people 
in each soviet immigrant family the total in jerusalem translates 
to 3420 to 4560 immigrants in annexed areas 
absorption ministry spokeswoman ida benshitreet refused to 
confirm or deny the estimate she said the ministry did not 
distinguish between immigrants settled in jewish west jerusalem or 
the arab eastern sector because government policy is to consider 
jerusalem a united city 
city spokeswoman bonnie boxer said she believed the figure of up 
4560 immigrants in annexed areas of jerusalem was too high but 
she did not provide statistics 
earlier this year president bush upset israeli officials when he 
restated the longstanding but infrequently expressed us policy 
that views east jerusalem as occupied land

shining path rebels have formed a new front to 
push their insurgency into lima and other coastal urban areas 
president alan garcia said after two powerful car bombs exploded 
within blocks of the government palace 
garcia spoke wednesday in an atmosphere of stepped up rebel 
attacks in lima and a series of weekend raids around the capital 
that resulted in the seizure of five shining path safe houses and 31 
arrests 
the president who leaves office july 28 said the newly formed 
peoples defense revolutionary movement is the urban 
metropolitan organ of the shining path 
the maoistinspired shining path operates in at least half of 
peru especially in the mountains and jungle but has had little 
success in expanding to coastal cities 
at least 18500 people have been killed in political violence 
related to the decadeold insurgency which was launched in the 
andean highlands 
the shining path draws much of its support from indigenous 
peoples resentful of the economic and political dominance in the 
country of 22 million of descendants of european immigrants 
the wave of violence comes four days before a presidential runoff 
that pits novelist mario vargas llosa a freemarket activist 
against centrist agricultural engineer alberto fujimori 
the shining path has called on voters to boycott sundays vote 
and threatened election day armed strikes in andean cities 
in one of the guerrilla safehouses raided in an upperclass lima 
suburb police found tons of shining path documents and propaganda 
they also found personal possessions that apparently belonged to 
shining path leader abimael guzman 
garcia said he believed the raids proved that the chief of 
terrorism actively participates in shining path operations 
guzman went underground in 1979 and over the years there have 
been numerous rumors he was dead 
the raids also proved that the new urban front has been formed 
garcia said the people who were captured were essential to the 
new movement 
two people were injured in the car bombings near the government 
palace on tuesday night and wednesday and garcia called the upsurge 
in urban violence a desperate response to the weekend raids 
in other violence wednesday in lima a city of 6 million four 
rebels armed with machine guns took over a neighborhood electoral 
office 
they forced the electoral workers outside and set fire to the 
office firefighters said the blaze destroyed most of the documents 
in the building including identification for electoral workers 
guerrillas blew up at least three hightension power pylons 
tuesday night blacking out parts of the capital and other coastal 
cities where most of perus 22 million people live 
in predawn attacks wednesday guerrillas threw gasoline bombs at 
a city bus and at a stove factory owned by a senatorelect of 
fujimoris change 90 party according to police 
tuesdays car bomb went off behind limas roman catholic 
cathedral which faces the main plaza where the government palace is 
located police said the cathedral was not damaged but one passerby 
was wounded 
operating out of its stronghold in ayacucho the shining path has 
spread throughout perus highlands since it launched its armed 
insurgency in may 1980 
the movement which seeks to impose a peasantworker state also 
controls much of perus jungle efforts to move into limas 
sprawling shantytowns however have been countered by strong police 
crackdowns

germany to be a member of the nato alliance which the soviets 
oppose

leaders would discuss the problems of the alleuropean structure 
disarmament and strengthening security on the continent the 
further cooperation of the members of the warsaw pact

of a united germany and the integration of the warsaw pact and the 
north atlantic treaty organization in a new alleuropean security 
structure 
tass said gorbachev would report on his summit with president 
bush and in washington last week the warsaw pact meeting includes 
political and military leaders as well as foreign ministers of the 
member countries

the legislature gave final approval to a 
528 million school finance package the governor promises to sign 
ending months of wrangling over how to meet a court over to steer 
more money to poor districts 
i think its a great step forward we made some very 
significant changes in the way were going to do business in public 
education in the state of texas republican gov bill clements 
said wednesday 
in bills passed tuesday and wednesday the house and senate 
approved education reforms budget cuts fund transfers and a 
quartercent boost in the state sales tax now 6 cents on the 
dollar to help pay for the package 
clements killed two previous plans because they relied on a 
halfcent increase 
but he said he agreed to the quartercent increase as a 
compromise and to fend off the prospect of a courtwritten funding 
plan a judge had previously assigned a court master to write a plan 
if the legislature failed to do so 
the governor said he is optimistic the tax increase will be 
rescinded in next years session 
the overhaul became necessary when the state supreme court in 
october declared texas schoolfinance system unconstitutional 
because of big disparities in spending between rich and poor 
districts in the 31 millionstudent system 
as in most states schools in texas are supported primarily by 
local property taxes 
i think that what we have passed here and what we have agreed 
upon will more than satisfy the courts clements said i think 
this will lay it to rest 
courts have struck down school finance systems in a dozen states 
in recent years the others are kentucky new jersey kansas 
wisconsin california connecticut washington west virginia 
wyoming arkansas and montana 
the democraticcontrolled legislature has been meeting since 
february holding four special sessions on schoolfinance reform 
the 528 million would be pumped into the 135 billionayear 
school finance system in the upcoming academic year 
among other things the package would increase testing of 
students and give the governor authority to appoint the state 
education commissioner the commissioner now is appointed by the 
state board of education 
some lawmakers said the legislation does not go far enough to 
meet the supreme court order members we will be back dont 
fool yourself we havent resolved the issue said rep gregory 
luna a democrat

most leading newspapers today 
quoted government officials as saying president fw de klerk would 
likely end the fouryearold state of emergency in an address to 
parliament later in the day 
the emergency laws which include some of the harshest 
restrictions on political activity ever imposed by south africas 
white rulers must be renewed by midnight friday if they are to 
remain in effect 
beeld an afrikaanslanguage newspaper with strong ties to the 
government said the only decision yet to be made was whether the 
emergency would be lifted totally or partially 
the african national congress and other leading antiapartheid 
groups have made the repeal of the emergency one of their 
preconditions for fullscale negotiations with the government on a 
new constitution 
most englishlanguage newspapers quoted government sources as 
saying the emergency decree would be totally lifted they said the 
government would rely on previous security legislation passed by 
parliament to control unrest and political violence 
most papers based their predictions on wednesdays sixhour 
cabinet meeting at which the emergency was discussed at length the 
star the nations largest daily said there were strong 
indications that the cabinet decided to end the emergency 
the citizen a progovernment johannesburg newspaper said 
government sources indicated the end of the state of emergency 
in its entirety would be more in line with with mr de klerks moves 
to normalize south african society as soon as possible than a 
partial lifting of the emergency 
many of the emergency regulations are duplicated in existing 
legislation but the emergency decree allowed the government and 
police to bypass the courts in detaining people without trial 
banning political activity suspending newspapers and censoring 
public speech 
the emergency decree also protected police against prosecution 
de klerk has said he would lift the state of emergency if 
authorities were confident they could control violence particularly 
in the northeastern province of natal where more than 500 blacks 
died in factional fighting in the first three months of this year 
business day in johannesburg said senior government officials 
expected de klerk to announce that violence in natal would be dealt 
with under the existing public safety act the act enables the 
minister of law and order to declare the province an unrest area 
some newspapers said that ending the state of emergency at this 
time could be seen as an opportunity to undermine anc leader nelson 
mandelas calls for continued sanctions against south africa 
mandela is on a sixweek trip to europe north america and 
africa he was scheduled to meet with french president francois 
mitterrand in paris at about the same time de klerk was to address 
parliament 
business day quoted mandela as saying in a french television 
interview monday if france reduces sanctions then the south 
african government will slow down the rhythm of change

moolman mentz spokesman for the proapartheid conservative party 
they couldnt cope with the violence even with the state of 
emergency because they were not applying it our view is the 
government is trying to appease everybody

gold prices fell sharply in europe this morning 
touching a fouryear low in london the dollar rose in moderate 
trading 
in early london dealings gold fell briefly to 35150 its 
lowest level since july 1986 the movement was a carry over of asian 
selling after the sydney market took gold through 355 a key chart 
level dealers said 
the move below that chart level which has been anticipated for 
weeks came on the back of australian producer selling in what was 
essentially a thin market they said 
golds fall however continued through asian dealings and into 
early european trading 
gold rebounded briefly to 355 on a flurry of middle east buying 
orders at the days low dealers said 
but apparent profittaking by middle east investors along with 
fears that large arab players in the gold market would move to push 
bullion lower again brought fresh selling into the market 
it was just a matter of time before it broke 355 a zurich 
dealer said 
gold opened in london at a bid price of 35350 a troy ounce 
down from 35950 bid late wednesday at midmorning the citys 
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of 35325 
in zurich the bid price was 35225 down from 35860 late 
wednesday 
earlier in hong kong gold fell 575 to close at a bid 35567 
silver fell in london to a bid price of 499 a troy ounce from 
wednesdays 5085 
foreign exchange traders said the us currency was in good 
demand though dominated by political considerations rather than new 
economic data 
traders identified uncertainty about unrest in the soviet union 
and about the impact of german monetary union as the two major 
themes boosting the dollar 
investors also were reassured by indications from federal reserve 
officials that us interest rates would probably maintain current 
levels dealers said 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins the 
dollar fell 005 yen to a closing 15255 yen later in london it 
was quoted at a higher rate of 15267 yen 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late wednesday 
16935 west german marks up from 16870 
14381 swiss francs up from 14280 
57088 french francs up from 56870

explorers bored a 250foot shaft through the 
greenland icecap to a b17 bomber buried since world war ii said a 
sponsor who was awaiting word today of their findings 
theyre going to try to enlarge the hole to get into a hatch 
pat epps president of the greenland expedition society said 
wednesday 
one plan was to use hot water from the thermal borer that cut 
through the arctic ice to enlarge the bottom of the shaft if that 
doesnt work somebody has to go down there with electric chain 
saws and carve around the airplane epps said 
epps who had been on the icecap with the expedition until last 
week heard by radio from greenland on wednesday morning that the 
expedition succeeded in reaching the plane 
the bomber is one of two b17s and six twinengine p38 
lightning fighters that crashlanded when they ran out of fuel after 
being decoyed by false radio transmissions from german submarines 
while en route to europe in 1942 
epps and atlanta architect richard taylor formed an expedition to 
find and salvage the planes 
this year the third consecutive year the men flew to the icecap 
a team led by taylor used a thermal borer to drill the 42inch 
diameter shaft to the b17 named big stoop 
a second team led by angelo pizzagalli of burlington vt used 
a huge auger to bore a hole 16 feet in diameter toward a p38 
epps who hopes to fly one of the p38s off the icecap said 
plans call for getting all six fighters out by sept 1 
the eight planes crashlanded july 15 1942 their crews camped 
in one of the b17s for nine days until rescuers arrived on dog 
sleds 
in the early 1970s col carl rudder one of the p38 pilots 
mentioned the planes to roy degan a commercial airline pilot who 
brought the idea of an arctic expedition to epps 
the explorers eventually obtained search and salvage rights from 
denmark which administers greenland 
in 1988 the society found the aircraft using lowfrequency 
subsurface radar last year expedition members drilled down to the 
b17 and brought back poker chipsize pieces of its skin 
epps estimated his group will have spent 800000 to 1 million 
by sept 1 financed by fund raising and rolls ltd pizzagallis 
nonprofit corporation in vermont

state medical regulators have joined prosecutors 
in investigating dr jack kevorkian the suicidemachine inventor 
treading the line separating outsider from outlaw 
the department of licensing and regulation launched a probe 
wednesday of the 62yearold retired pathologist who hooked an 
alzheimers victim to the druginjecting apparatus and let her take 
her life with the press of a button 
our role is to gather the facts and evidence and determine what 
occurred said mary macdowell director of the departments health 
investigation division 
evidence of a violation of regulations would be referred to the 
state board of medicine which could reprimand kevorkian or lift his 
license macdowell said 
meanwhile oakland county prosecutor richard thompson has not 
decided whether to charge kevorkian with a crime in the death monday 
of janet adkins attorney general frank kelley acknowledged the 
state has no clearcut law against assisting in a suicide 
state police impounded the suicide machine but circuit judge 
alice gilbert on wednesday denied thompsons request for an order 
barring further use of the device the judge set another hearing for 
friday 
kevorkian who scorns the medical mainstream as too timid 
defended the machine amid the fierce legal and ethical debate its 
use has stirred he said a duplicate device could be built within 
days but he did not say whether he has arranged other suicides 
what im doing is absolutely ethical kevorkian said 
wednesday on abcs nightline of course its audacious but 
somebody has to do it doctors werent going to tell anybody and 
patients out there want it 
mrs adkins 54 had been diagnosed a year ago with alzheimers 
an incurable disease that leads to progressive deterioration of the 
brain and had traveled 2000 miles from her home in portland ore 
to die through the use of kevorkians machine 
having read about the device she thought that sounded like a 
very very humane and painless way to end her life her husband 
ronald adkins said on nightline 
kevorkian drove with mrs adkins to a park and attached her to 
the electricpowered device in the back of his van mrs adkins 
pressed a button that delivered chemicals that stopped her heart 
death came within minutes kevorkian said 
kevorkian said he offered his device at no cost and would do so 
for anyone else wanting him to help them die 
everyone says to me hey youre taking on yourself like god 
well then come on and do something he said in an interview on a 
plaza bench outside city hall in the detroit suburb of royal oak 
if its legal let me do it if its illegal stop me 
the state medical board never has disciplined kevorkian 
macdowell said but his support of doctorassisted euthanasia is 
only one aspect of a medical career that has placed him well outside 
the mainstream of his profession 
he has advocated medical experimentation on deathrow inmates and 
the use of cadavers blood in transfusions known to friends as 
dr death he scorns the medical community which he said is 
cowed by the influence of religion 
in 1988 kevorkian asked the hemlock society which advocates the 
right to death on demand to refer terminally ill members to a 
center he wanted to open in california founder and executive 
director derek humphry said 
i persuaded him not to take up in california humphry said 
from the netherlands where he was presiding over an international 
convention on righttodie issues we didnt want to be involved 
in lawbreaking 
the pontiac native received his medical degree in 1952 from the 
university of michigan colleagues said he was a medical maverick by 
the time he completed his residency in 1958 
hes a loner said dr murray levin an internal medicine 
specialist in bloomfield hills hes dropped out of medical 
circles as far as i know it bothers me why a guy so competent 
is retired 
hes always been a free thinker said dr gerald abrams a 
former classmate of kevorkians and now a professor of pathology at 
the university of michigan medical school he always impressed us 
as being very bright very sincere his arent exactly mainstream 
ideas 
kevorkian worked from 1959 to 1966 at pontiac general hospital 
then operated a diagnostic clinic in southfield for three years 
from 1969 to 1976 he was laboratory director at saratoga general 
hospital in detroit then worked at several small hospitals in the 
los angeles area before returning to michigan 
unable to find work within a medical community hostile to his 
views kevorkian said he retired in 1982 to study ethics write 
articles for european medical and law journals his friends recalled 
the surrealistic oil paintings he produced about 15 years ago with 
medical themes and titles like nausea fever and coma 
theyre pretty powerful kevorkian said theyre not great 
art but theyve got a lot of impact i like to shake people up

food service workers with aids would be denied 
the full protection of civil rights legislation for the disabled 
under an amendment endorsed by both houses of congress 
by a voice vote wednesday the senate agreed to instruct its 
negotiators reconciling house and senate versions of the americans 
with disabilities act to accept the amendment in the housepassed 
version of the bill 
the senate passed the bill last september by a 768 vote the 
house passed it 40320 last month 
although nonbinding the motion by sen jesse helms rnc 
reflected the senates attitude toward the amendment backed by the 
restaurant industry the amendment provides the only exemption for 
any group of disabled people 
under the amendment employers in food industries such as 
restaurants and supermarkets could reassign workers infected with 
the aids virus to areas where they would not be near food 
the only other group exempted from the protections of the bill is 
people such as pedophiles or pyromaniacs whose mental condition 
leads to criminal behavior 
the americans with disabilities act would grant the same rights 
to the estimated 43 million disabled americans that the civil rights 
act of 1964 gave to blacks and other minorities 
opponents of the aids amendment argued that it flies in the face 
of medical evidence about how the fatal disease is spread 
supporters said restaurants would lose customers if they found out a 
chef or other employee had aids 
it sets us back in our fight against ignorance it slows our 
fight against discrimination and it undercuts our fight against 
aids said sen alan cranston dcalif 
aids is spread by intimate sexual contact use of contaminated 
hypodermic needles and use of contaminated blood products 
according to medical authorities homosexual men and intravenous 
drug users have been the main victims 
helms called the belief that aids is spread in limited ways 
conventional wisdom and added you try telling that to john 
q public 
the bill does not protect homosexuals or active drug users even 
without the amendment it doesnt protect anyone whose disease poses 
a serious risk of contagion 
the chief sponsors of the bill rep steny h hoyer dmd and 
sen tom harkin diowa said the amendment had been the only 
serious difference between the house and senate versions of the bill 
although the voice vote means no individual senators vote is 
known the senate had voted 5340 to reject an earlier motion by 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine to kill helms motion

the police and some cabinet 
ministers have had wide restrictive powers under the 4yearold 
national state of emergency but many of the regulations have not 
uniformly been enforced since president fw de klerk came to power 
in august 
many of the powers granted to police under the emergency 
regulations already existed in security laws however the emergency 
decree bypassed the courts and granted police indemnity from 
prosecution for any action they took in good faith under the 
emergency 
here are some of the actions police and government ministers have 
taken under the national emergency declared by former president pw 
botha on june 12 1986 
more than 30000 people most of them black were detained for 
varying lengths of time without being charged with a crime some 
were held for nearly three years some were as young as 11 years old 
police did not have to tell inquiring relatives or lawyers 
whether they had a missing person in detention or give any 
information about a detainee to anyone 
newspapers were prohibited from reporting the names of detainees 
without police permission and it was illegal for anyone including 
freed detainees to describe the circumstances of detention 
when they were released the government could restrict former 
detainees to their homes prohibit them from working meeting with 
other people or participating in political activity although they 
had never been charged or convicted of a crime 
police without warrants could search any person building or 
vehicle and seize anything they wanted 
security officers could prohibit anyone from carrying out any 
activities or acts whatsoever 
more than 20 organizations were banned 
several newspapers were temporarily suspended from publication 
journalists were prohibited from being within sight of any 
political unrest and were immediately arrested if spotted by police 
tape recordings and film were seized without warrants 
journalists were prohibited from reporting about any police 
activity in connection with unrest unless police gave their 
permission local newspapers were prohibited from indicating whether 
news articles had been censored by the emergency regulations 
certain tshirts with slogans were made illegal police 
confiscated political banners flags and pamphlets under the 
emergency regulations even though they were not prohibited under any 
law passed by parliament 
all outdoor political rallies and demonstrations were banned at 
one time 
police issued regulations for funerals limiting the number of 
mourners designating who could speak setting the time and place 
for the burials 
the government banned subversive statements from being 
uttered or reported calls for boycotts strikes of foreign 
sanctions statements which might undermine the morale of the 
military and at one time any call for the release of detainees 
were defined as subversive

the layers of mud on the floors bathroom 
fixtures and walls are not the only legacy of a week of record 
flooding along the trinity river there are the snakes fire ants 
and huge furry spiders 
and theres the oppressive odor of mold and dead fish 
i used to be fussy but now janet messenger said her 
voice trailing off as she surveyed the damp floor buckled walls and 
ripped tile of her home on aptly named mud street weve had a lot 
of good times here its kind of sad i dont think were going to 
stay 
her husband charles gets so upset about their plight he wont 
even talk about it 
residents are trying to put their lives back together almost two 
weeks after the water began receding on the trinity just below the 
lake livingston dam in southeastern texas when torrential rain in 
early may filled lake livingston to record levels the dam gates 
were opened wider than ever flooding bottom land downstream 
the river crested 30 feet above flood stage at nearby liberty on 
may 25 on wednesday the river was still 4 feet above the flood 
mark at liberty which is about 70 miles northeast of houston 
thirteen deaths were blamed on storms and flooding in northern 
texas that also extended into louisiana and oklahoma no deaths or 
injuries were blamed on the floods along the lower trinity but 
lives were uprooted 
its a mess said dorothy harrington who measured more than 
6 feet of water in her house a lot of people are selling out 
but we cant afford to and nobodys going to buy it anyway 
her husband tom used a scraper to remove inches of mud caked in 
their garage she scrubbed sinks and bathtubs in a race against 
fuzzy green splotches of mold that thrive in the steamy climate 
in their front yard a picnic table a fence a squirrel feeder 
high off the ground and a sign with their name and address were 
covered with grass leaves and dirt left behind when the water 
receded 
the retired couple rescued the dangling sign wiped it off and 
hung it properly 
i start one place and end up doing something else mrs 
harrington said during a break in her cleaning 
water was in the homes of the camilla twin harbors subdivision 
adjacent to the dam for seven days 
what many residents wait for now is a visit from someone from the 
federal emergency management agency which doles out government aid 
john pencavage a fema agent who verifies claims said he has 
been in texas since early may and expects to remain for several more 
weeks he says he wore out a camera taking pictures of damage and 
hasnt had time to replace it 
this is home for me all ive got left henry prlka told 
pencavage 
eight feet of water left prlkas air conditioner broken his 
telephone packed with mud and the white ceiling of his mobile home 
green with mold 
im leaving this time he said its terrible whats 
happened to us 
as of this week fema had received 4848 applications for aid 
from texas families and businesses spokesman george burgess said 
fema also had provided 2168 families with more than 15 million in 
temporary housing money and 538 families with 168 million in 
grants for emergency aid or repairs not otherwise covered by the red 
cross or insurance 
lonnie trotti promised to remain and float out another one 
its funny sad aggravating heartbreaking said trotti who 
put his house on stilts after a flood a year ago and still got water 
this time but i do have a trailer i can rebuild and ive still 
got a place to go fishing

even during the last hours of his life 
aaron shoreys didnt give up on his goal of walking across an 
auditorium stage to claim the high school diploma that meant so much 
but in the end the heart disease he fought all his life made him 
too weak and he had to go home where he later died in his mothers 
arms 
he wanted that diploma he wanted to graduate so bad and he was 
so sick said jane shoreys who had watched and waited with her 
son for 15 months for a heartlung transplant that never came 
he never really said anything but i knew in my heart that it 
was close to the end he was just so weak and i think he knew it 
too she said 
mrs shoreys said her sons determination to graduate never 
wavered even though he was too ill to attend graduation rehearsal 
monday morning 
in the afternoon he said he had to go he was in line ready to 
get his diploma when the music started and he just became too weak 
and we had to take him home 
the 18yearolds death was tempered for his family by the 
fulfillment of his dream to finish high school 
it was a huge achievement to be able to get his four years done 
in high school he did finish on time and he was a good student 
mrs shoreys said he had a lousy body but a really good mind 
im glad that we got 18 years said his sister michelle 
we were happy about the graduation unfortunately we werent 
able to see him walk down the aisle 
the flag at doherty high school was at halfstaff wednesday two 
days earlier principal pasquale quitadamo had expected to hand 
shoreys his diploma 
the principal said few in the audience realized why shoreys 
didnt show up he was a fighter he tried his best the 
principal said if this was what was meant to be he certainly had 
to be happy about completing his four years 
mrs shoreys said her son opened his graduation presents monday 
night at about 2 am tuesday he called me and i went in and he 
died she said 
born with a congenital heart defect that also affected his lungs 
shoreys had been on a waiting list for a heartlung transplant said 
his physician dr allan goldblatt 
if theres some sense to his tragic death it is to bring to 
the people of this country an understanding that there must be so 
many aaron shoreys who are missing out on the opportunity for a 
potential future and that opportunity is not going to be available 
without more organ donors goldblatt said 
mrs shoreys said she and her husband peter agreed to donate 
any of their sons usable organs his corneas have been 
transplanted she said 
it would make aaron very happy she said

thousands of people armed with spears stones and 
guns are massing along the border between the central asian 
republics of kirghizia and uzbekistan seeking to avenge the 48 
people who have died in ethnic warfare a top soviet official said 
today 
interior minister vadim bakatin told lawmakers in moscow that the 
violence which began three days ago in one town in kirghizia had 
spilled over to uzbekistan and spread to five regions in kirghizia 
a state of emergency was declared today in frunze the capital of 
kirghizia where one person died from a beating cars were destroyed 
and thousands of people surrounded communist party and government 
buildings an official said they demanded the resignation of the 
republics leaders and urged kirghiz to unite and strike back at 
uzbeks the tass news agency said kirghiz unite and kirghiz 
to osh they chanted referring to the frontier town 195 miles to 
the south where the fighting flared monday over a land dispute 
tass reported 
the unrest has been the latest in a series of ethnic outbreaks 
fueled by poverty or political conflict that have occurred in the 
more permissive political climate of president mikhail s 
gorbachevs 5year tenure 
the conflicts especially a bitter feud between armenia and 
azerbaijan in the caucusus have claimed hundreds of lives and 
forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes in the face 
of attacks by rival ethnic groups 
an estimated 2000 uzbeks tried to cross the border from their 
republic to fight in osh but security forces stopped them and 
sealed all roads between uzbekistan and kirghizia the unofficial 
interfax news agency reported 
a state of emergency and curfew are in effect in osh with troops 
patrolling the streets and sealing off the city 
overnight in frunze security forces fired warning shots to 
disperse groups of students who committed acts of hooliganism 
damaging a childrens hospital a cloth factory and a market tass 
reported 
a state of emergency and curfew were declared in frunze where 
more than 4000 angry students rallied in the center of the city and 
demanded a chance to fight uzbeks said ivan v pavlov a department 
head on the citys party executive committee 
participants at the rally also gave leaders of the republic three 
days to resign tass said militia units held back the crowds 
a shopkeeper from the bazaar died today from a beating he 
received the day before said pavlov the city party official he 
said no further deaths were reported today but that angry crowds had 
destroyed 34 cars and several buses 
bakatin the top soviet law enforcement official told parliament 
that thousands of ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks were standing at the 
ready striving to avenge wrongdoings he said violence had been 
reported in uzbekistan and had spread to five regions in kirghizia 
but he did not identify the sites 
bakatin said the local clashes may develop into conflict 
between the two republics tass said 
the militia cannot handle interethnic conflicts particularly 
in the kindling of cavedwelling and medieval nationalism bakatin 
said in a speech to the soviet of nationalities one of two houses 
of the soviet parliament 
tasss englishlanguage service left out bakatins reference to 
cavedwelling and medieval which were carried on its russian 
wires 
the uzbeks and the kirghiz are predominantly sunni moslem ethnic 
groups that speak different turkic dialects 
soviet central asia with high levels of poverty and 
unemployment has been hit repeatedly by violence since gorbachev 
began to relax central controls the countrys worsening economic 
crisis has hit the region particularly hard 
in the fighting at osh since saturday 48 people have been 
killed 11 of them in the previous 24 hours and 333 injured 
including 42 law and order personnel 39 militiamen and three 
soldiers bakatin said 
security forces stood between the warring bands of kirghiz and 
uzbeks said bakatin adding that 1500 regular army soldiers 900 
interior ministry militia and troops and 450 troops under the kgb 
border guard were trying to keep order in osh 
the fighting was triggered by the distribution of land for 
individual houses in osh a heavily populated area along the 
twisting border between uzbekistan and kirghizia bakatin said 
he blamed the dispute on folly selfconceit and a bureaucratic 
approach to the division of land where the interests of one 
nationality were ignored but gave no further details 
the area is closed to western correspondents and official 
accounts of the unrest and the death toll have been sketchy

pay phones in an innercity park are going 
lowtech to combat drug dealers who rely on pushbutton models 
modern telephones in macarthur park will be replaced with rotary 
dial phones under a city council plan adopted unanimously wednesday 
the older style phones cannot activate most pagers used by the 
dealers 
similar steps were taken in the minneapolisst paul area in 
april 
the police department was charged with overseeing the plan that 
includes asking pay telephone companies to install lighting and bar 
incoming calls at phones in highcrime areas 
drug dealers like beepers because they can be used on the street 
and because some fear telephone taps police say 
customers call dealers and can leave phone numbers anonymously 
dealers often send suppliers numbers of the pay phones where they 
are or use prearranged number codes to set up drug deliveries 
macarthur park is a sprawling landmark west of downtown where 
tourists can rent paddle boats in recent years it has attracted 
homeless people and the dealers 
representatives of pacific bell and pacific coin have pledged 
cooperation in the effort to disconnect drug dealers

prime minister yitzhak shamir has agreed to take 
tougher measures against the palestinian uprising in an effort to 
draw key farright factions into a coalition government a 
rightwing party official said today 
shamir who heads the rightwing likud bloc also has promised 
his new coalition would allocate more money for enlarging the jewish 
settlements in the occupied lands the daily maariv reported 
the reports came amid feverish attempts by likud to overcome 
feuds among eight potential coalition partners by a deadline of 
friday when shamirs mandate to form a government expires 
shamirs spokesman avi pazner declined to comment on the 
reports of tougher steps against the uprising or more money for 
settlements 
when we announce the government tomorrow we will aso announce 
the policy guidelines he said 
pazner described shamir as being close to forming a rightwing 
coalition the prime ministers confidence was bolstered today when 
labor member efraim gur announced he would defect to the likud 
that would give shamir 62 votes if he gets all eight religious 
and rightwing parties if he fails to form a government israel 
could be forced to hold early national elections 
ultraorthodox religious parties that would be key to forming the 
cabinet reportedly were demanding more government jobs before 
agreeing to back a likudled coalition 
the uncertainty prompted president chaim herzog to intervene 
wednesday and ask shamir and shimon peres leader of the 
leftofcenter labor party to meet and consider building another 
joint coalition like the one that collapsed march 15 by this 
morning peres had agreed to the meeting but shamir failed to 
respond said herzogs spokesman giora pordes 
israel television said herzogs call for another unity coalition 
had been prompted by a flood of letters he received in the last week 
from israeli citizens worried about the continuing political void 
the collapse of the government in march came in a parliamentary 
vote of no confidence after likud refused to go along with labor 
demands that israel agree to a usproposed first meeting with 
palestinian representatives 
peres then failed in a 35day bid to form a leftleaning 
coalition herzog subsequently gave shamir a mandate to try on april 
27 his time runs out on friday evening 
danny dayan secretarygeneral of the farright tehiya party 
said that to meet the deadline shamir agreed to hardline action 
against the intefadeh the 30monthold palestinian uprising and to 
steps to increase the population of the 130 jewish settlements in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
dayan denied there was an agreement on giving more money to 
settlements but he said his party would insist on that once a 
government was installed 
dayan reached by telephone also said the policy guidelines 
will say that measures will be taken to end the intefadeh but 
that the agreement did not detail what measures were involved 
untraright leaders have been demanding such steps as expelling 
arab stonethrowers from the occupied territories and destroying 
more homes of terror suspects 
such steps could further strain ties with the united states 
which already has complained about the harsh moves taken by israel 
to put down the revolt against occupation

his resignation would be effective aug 3 at the end of his term as 
vice chairman his term on the central bank would have ended aug

expansion 
for more than a year the central bank has sought to stem 
inflation by keeping a tight grip on credit without tipping the 
economy into a recession the result continued but slow economic 
growth has become known as the soft landing 
i am extremely proud to have played a part in the unprecedented 
period of sustained economic growth and low inflation that has 
characterized the decade of the 1980s and continues into the 
1990s johnson said in his letter of resignation to president bush 
although there are still major issues to be addressed as this 
country moves ahead i feel optimistic about our future indeed 
part of my reasoning for leaving at this time is the confidence i 
have in my colleagues at the federal reserve and in the economic 
team you have assembled in your administration he continued 
johnson said he plans to return to george mason university in 
washingtons virginia suburbs and assume the koch chair in 
international economics and become director of the center for global 
market studies 
i deeply regret but understand manley johnsons decision 
fed chairman alan greenspan said in a statement the vice chairman 
and i have been an effective team ill miss him 
the fed is the nations central bank whose primary responsibility 
is monetary policy its federal open market committee actually makes 
the key decisions affecting the cost and availability of money and 
credit 
the fed is run by a sevenmember board of governors 
headquartered in washington and a nationwide network of 12 district 
banks the governors are appointed by the president and confirmed by 
the senate to serve 14year terms 
the newest member former assistant treasury secretary david 
mullins was confirmed by the senate last month bringing the board 
to full strength

us doctors cut back their use of donated blood 
for transfusions during the 1980s apparently because of fear of 
passing on aids according to a study released today 
the study found that transfusions of whole blood and red cells 
totaled 99 million pints in 1980 reached a peak of 122 million 
pints in 1986 and have declined since then during the same period 
people have sharply increased the practice of setting aside their 
own blood for use during operations 
the study directed by dr douglas m surgenor of the center for 
blood research in boston was based on a survey of about 5800 
hospitals and blood centers it was published in todays issue of 
the new england journal of medicine 
among the findings 
transfusions of whole blood and red cells fell to 116 million 
pints in 1987 and continued to decline in 1988 the last year of the 
survey 
transfusions of blood plasma dropped almost 9 percent during the 
decade 
donations of autologous blood the practice of setting aside 
blood for ones own use increased from 30000 pints in 1982 to 
397000 pints in 1987 
the supply of blood donated for others was unchanged between 
1986 and 1988 
the researchers attributed the changes to fear of passing on the 
aids virus through transfusions the chance of catching the disease 
from a transfusion has been slight since blood banks began screening 
for the virus in 1985

thousands of students rallied in front of 
parliament today and workers blocked a main street leading to the 
city as east german lawmakers debated ways to head off widespread 
unemployment 
university students demanded that the stipends they receive for 
attending school be increased as the nation merges its economy with 
west germanys as part of the process of german unification 
the group marched around the parliament building and staged a 
sitin at its entrance but there were no major incidents 
education minister hans joachim meyer came outside to speak to 
the group of several thousands students and said the government 
would consider their demands 
but he also referred to east germanys difficult financial 
situation 
about 10 students got inside the parliament building while 
lawmakers were meeting unfurled a banner from the spectator gallery 
and threw leaflets to the floor below they were led away without 
incident 
about 3000 students and teachers in the southern city of 
chemnitz also staged a demonstration the government news agency adn 
said 
the broad agreement merging the german economies and social 
institutions contains no details about the stipends that students 
received for attending school 
meanwhile electronics industry workers from the outlying city of 
teltow blocked for about an hour a main thoroughfare connecting 
berlin with the city of potsdam adn said 
the workers were demanding protection from unemployment the 
electronics industry is expected to be among those that suffer the 
most from competition from the west 
many east germans already are buying radios and other 
sophisiticated electronics appliances from western manufacturers 
experts estimate that up to 4 million east germans may lose their 
jobs as the nations industries are forced to compete with more 
efficient western companies 
lawmakers debated measures to ease the transition to a free 
market including a government plan to set up retraining centers for 
workers likely to lose their jobs 
economics minister gerhard pohl said the government will discuss 
the possibility of closing down large sections of industies to 
conduct massive retraining programs 
but he said this would be done against the backdrop of the 
hopeless situation in the microelectronics auto and shoe 
industries in the industrial cities of the south where many giant 
outmoded industries are expected to fail 
in the west german capital bonn an opposition lawmaker warned 
of serious problems this autumn with east germanys system of 
vocational and technical schools 
social democrat gert weisskirchen said industries in east germany 
may have to cancel between 20000 and 30000 training contracts for 
students being groomed for skilled jobs in factories 
he said up to 60000 students may not be able to find work in 
their fields after their training is complete this year

jesse jackson is injecting himself into mayor 
marion barrys battle over drug charges saying prosecutors should 
revive plea bargain talks to spare all of us the pain of a 
racially divisive trial 
barry is open to a negotiated process jackson said he urged 
barry to promise he wont seek reelection and urged prosecutors to 
spare the mayor a prison sentence 
talk of a possible plea bargain dominated public discussion of 
barrys cocaine and perjury trial as the process of selecting a jury 
went into a fourth day today sixteen people were added wednesday to 
bring the jury pool to 25 four more prospective jurors were 
questioned this morning 
the mayor and prosecutors are at an impasse over the 
prosecutions insistence that he plead guilty to one of the three 
felony charges against him said a source close to the barry camp 
who insisted on anonymity 
if he pleaded guilty to a felony barry might face prison and 
would have to resign his office 
the mayor obviously does not want to resign the mayor 
obviously does not want to go to jail jackson said in an 
interview 
various reports have said barry may be willing to plead guilty to 
misdemeanor drug possession charges if he could finish out the last 
few months of his term 
but barrys attorney r kenneth mundy told reporters during a 
break in wednesdays court proceedings are there talks ongoing 
now no 
mundy disclosed he had spoken with jackson about the trial but 
wouldnt comment on those discussions 
jackson and walter fauntroy the district of columbias delegate 
to congress apparently had not succeeded in persuading prosecutors 
to reopen plea bargain talks 
us attorney jay stephens said tuesday it would be inappropriate 
to meet with a third party on a criminal matter and had no comment 
on jacksons latest remarks 
sources close to the prosecution who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said it would be extremely unlikely that stephens would 
meet with jackson 
barry is facing three felony charges of perjury 10 misdemeanor 
cocaine possession charges and one count of conspiracy hes accused 
of smoking crack cocaine in an fbi sting jan 18 and possessing 
cocaine at other times and lying about it to a federal grand jury 
fauntroy himself a mayoral candidate called a news conference 
to remind reporters he had earlier appealed to barry and prosecutors 
to spare the city and the nation the agony of a trial 
jackson who until now has not spoken extensively about the drug 
charges urged barry to declare he wont run again and prosecutors 
to seek a settlement 
i would hope that both of them could work out an agreement 
honorably and within the law short of a fullblown long nasty 
divisive trial to spare all of us that pain jackson said 
in a separate television interview jackson said the debate over 
barrys troubles has become very republicandemocrat very 
blackwhite its very nasty 
i would hope that the mayor would determine he would not run 
again and would really challenge the justice department to work 
out some settlement process he told wusatv 
most of the 16 jurors added to the pool wednesday said they were 
somewhat familiar with the case they included one man who worried 
his family could face threats if his name was made public and a 
woman who said race had a lot to do with the investigation of 
the black mayor

the judge called victims and the four men together to hear from 
both sides before determining the attackers sentences three

one of the attackers said the shootings were a prank that went 
too far 
victim frank polenta said the four couldnt be charged with 
discrimination 
you shot at men and women young and old black and white you 
hit all neighborhoods he said you caused needless and 
senseless pain not only to your victims but to your parents 
helen howell said her hand swelled to twice its normal size after 
the driveby shooting and told the judge how her wedding band had to 
be cut from her finger in a hospital emergency room 
what you did changed my life emotionally and physically she 
told her attacker im sorry for your parents and your teachers 
but im not sorry for you

acts of violence vandalism and harassment 
against gay people were widespread again last year but new 
antihatecrime laws offer hope the trend can be reversed according 
to a report released today 
the report was presented at a news conference by the national gay 
amp lesbian task force along with civil rights law enforcement and 
congressional leaders 
hate crimes exist because the narrowminded and meanspirited 
among us have judged some of their fellow citizens to be less 
deserving of respect than themselves said sen alan cranston 
dcalif the more that we bring these crimes to light the less 
tolerable they will be 
the fifth annual survey of antigay violence in the united 
states recounts 7031 such incidents in 1989 they ranged from 
verbal harassment to homicide and were documented by 119 
organizations and individuals in 40 states and the district of 
columbia 
last year the nations lesbian and gay community celebrated 
the 20th anniversary of the stonewall riots which sparked the 
modern gay rights movement said kevin berrill author of the 
report although we have made remarkable strides toward freedom 
since stonewall we remain a community under siege battling an 
epidemic of bigotry and violence 
in june 1968 patrons rioted at the stonewall a gay bar in new 
yorks greenwich village when police tried to raid it 
the data for the survey came from questionnaires sent to 650 gay 
activists and organizations nationwide the task force acknowledged 
its methods were unscientific and noted that more than half the 
groups that responded in 1988 did not do so in 1989 however the 
survey gives a broad look at the prevalence of antigay harassment 
and violence 
of the total incidents reported last year approximately 
twothirds were acts of verbal harassment the report said of the 
remaining 2322 incidents 34 percent were physical assaults 31 
percent were threats of violence 17 percent were acts of vandalism 
14 percent were police abuse 3 percent were homicides and 1 
percent were arson or other victimization 
nineteen percent occurred on college campuses revealing 
dangerous intolerance and prejudice that threatens an academic 
environment of enlightenment berrill said 
fifteen percent were classified by local groups as aidsrelated 
indicating that some people continue to use the disease as a 
justification for antigay prejudice and violence the report said 
but the report pointed to laws passed in 1989 and 1990 aimed at 
curbing bias crimes including those against gay people 
on april 23 1990 president bush signed the hate crimes 
statistics act which requires the federal government to collect 
data on crimes based on race religion sexual orientation and 
ethnicity the report called this an historic victory for the 
nations gay and lesbian community 
hate crimes laws with antigay provisions also recently passed 
in california connecticut the district of columbia iowa 
minnesota new hampshire oregon vermont atlanta burlington 
iowa montgomery county md and st louis according to the report 
for the most part states reporting the highest number of 
antigay incidents were those without hate crime laws that included 
homosexuals the report found 
states with the highest number of documented episodes were north 
carolina 1204 texas 997 california 563 illinois 529 and 
ohio 387 
overall 1989s total of 7031 episodes is slightly lower than 
the 7248 reported in 1988 the report noted 
it added however given the many factors that affect annual 
totals and the relatively minor difference between 1989 and 1988 
figures it is not possible to accurately gauge whether the problem 
increased or decreased last year

the soviet union has shifted to a more 
encouraging stand on nato membership for a unified germany us 
secretary of state james a baker iii was quoted as telling western 
allies today 
baker privately briefed nato foreign ministers who began a 
twoday meeting at this resort on scotlands rugged west coast the 
ministers are seeking a new strategy for the western military 
alliance as the cold war draws to an end 
prime minister margaret thatcher said nuclear weapons and us 
forces remain essential in europe she also told the meeting of the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization at a luxury hotel in 
turnberry that the western military alliance should assume a more 
political role 
the meeting is the third in a series held this spring to try to 
map out a new strategy for nato in an era of reduced eastwest 
tensions leaders of the 16 nations meet in london next month to 
formally begin work on natos future 
west germany is a member of nato but east germany is part of the 
crumbling warsaw pact led by moscow nato wants the new central 
european state to remain in the western alliance but the kremlin 
has balked at the idea 
us officials said baker reported on his recent talks with 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze in the danish capital 
copenhagen 
a senior official of a nato delegation who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said baker indicated to the allies that the soviets 
were much more encouraging than at the summit last week in 
washington between presidents bush and mikhail s gorbachev 
they have many concerns but they are looking at more things to 
do to make nato membership for a unified germany more acceptable 
the official said its more of a change in spirit 
baker brought with him to the current meeting a soviet proposal 
for an accord that would help ease moscows concerns about a unified 
germany belonging to nato but he told reporters wednesday that he 
was not at liberty to get into the details of the soviet plan 
baker and his west german counterpart hansdietrich genscher 
were reported to be optimistic that the west would reach agreement 
with the kremlin on the military status of the new german state 
both indicated optimism that the soviets would ultimately 
come along with this said a british official who also requested 
anonymity 
mrs thatcher said nato needs to be more imaginative and work 
on a bigger canvas politically nato no longer has a clear 
frontline in europe 
with the spread of sophisticated weapons and military 
technology to areas like the middle east potential threats to nato 
may originate from outside europe she said calling for us 
forces and nuclear weapons to stay put 
mrs thatcher reiterated her vision of a grand alliance 
across europe based on a strengthened role for the 35nation 
eastwest conference on european security and cooperation it 
comprises all european nations except albania as well as the united 
states and canada 
this is the time to create a new european order an order for a 
europe which is undivided free and at peace nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner told the nato meeting he said the 
alliance must adapt to last years fall of hardline communist 
governments in eastern europe if we want to be able to meet the 
challenge of change we have to change ourselves he said 
the warsaw pact has been unraveling since the political upheavals 
in eastern europe hungary and czechoslovakia once staunch members 
have demanded the removal of red army troops from their soil

without the national state of 
emergency the government still has wide powers under its security 
laws to restrict political activity 
by using the law and the courts government ministers and the 
police force can take most of the actions which the 4yearold 
emergency regulations allowed but there are some changes in the 
three provinces where president fw de klerk ordered the emergency 
ended 
people detained without trial or whose freedom of activity is 
restricted can challenge the action in court under the emergency 
judges discretion was generally limited to determining whether a 
particular action was covered by the emergency decree the decree 
said police were empowered to take any action and to tell anyone 
to do anything 
police no longer have automatic immunity from prosecution for 
actions they take in good faith in an unrest situation 
the power of the police to conduct warrantless searches and 
seizures is reduced but not eliminated 
police commissioners can no longer make sweeping bans on all 
rallies marches or public gatherings in their region they have to 
obtain a magistrates order to halt specific activities however 
the minister of law and order still has power under the law to 
declare any region an unrest area and impose emergency 
regulations within it 
police lose their power to place restrictions on funerals in 
black townships and to prohibit the display of certain slogans 
government ministers can no longer seize newspapers or suspend 
them at will they can still halt newspaper publication but must go 
through legal procedures and their action can be challenged in court 
police cannot order journalists or community workers away from 
an unrest area merely by invoking emergency regulations they 
can still issue such orders but must have a legal reason

the superpowers may complete a treaty on 30 
percent cuts in longrange nuclear weapons as early as november a 
senior us negotiator said today 
linton brooks deputy head of the us delegation to the geneva 
negotiations told reporters he was confident the treaty would be 
finished by the end of the year a target affirmed at last weeks 
summit by president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
i think its possible to do it as early as sometime in 
november brooks said 
the three major areas of disagreement are on limits to soviet 
modernization of the ss18 ballistic missile constraints on the 
soviet backfire bomber and ways of limiting sales of longrange 
missiles to third countries 
brooks said the negotiators who return to the bargaining table 
in geneva on monday also have a lot of work left on details of an 
inspection regime for the treaty 
even as the superpowers are approaching the end of eight years of 
negotiations on this landmark treaty some critics are saying the 
ussoviet approach to reducing offensive nuclear weapons is 
becoming outdated 
on wednesday us and soviet scientists released a jointly 
published book that said future nuclear arms accords should provide 
for the destruction of warheads not just the missiles or other 
vehicles that deliver them 
the book reversing the arms race by the federation of 
american scientists and the committee of soviet scientists for 
global security also said the superpowers could cut the number of 
strategic nuclear weapons to less than 2000 on each side without 
creating an incentive to launch a preemptive first strike 
the ussoviet treaty nearing completion at the strategic arms 
reduction talks in geneva calls for a 30 percent reduction in 
strategic or longrange nuclear weapons to 6000 on each side 
the start treaty as drafted would not require the elimination of 
any warheads nor was there any such requirement in the 1987 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty that banned all us and 
soviet landbased missiles of medium range 
the start and inf treaties require destruction of missiles and 
missile launchers but put no restrictions on removing the 
fissionable material from the warheads and reusing it in other 
weapons not covered by the treaties 
allowing warheads from treatyprohibited weapons to be reused has 
not been a major drawback during an era in which both superpowers 
have tens of thousands of nuclear weapons the scientists said but 
it will become a problem in guarding against treaty cheating if 
future arms deals cut arsenals to minimal levels 
the scientist groups also said that for warhead dismantlement to 
be effective the superpowers should agree to halt production of new 
fissionable materials including plutonium tritium and enriched 
uranium used in warheads 
congress is increasingly interested in pursuing a ussoviet 
agreement to halt nuclear materials production but the bush 
administration is opposed 
the scientist groups noted that both moscow and washington 
already have had to reduce their nuclear materials production 
because of safety problems in manufacturing just this week new 
evidence emerged to indicate that problems at a key us weapons 
plant are more serious than previously believed

one of west germanys most wanted terrorist 
suspects linked to the slayings of a prominent banker and a wealthy 
industrialist has been captured officials said today 
susanne albrecht 39 a member of the notorious red army faction 
terrorist group was captured wednesday afternoon in front of her 
apartment in east berlin east germanys interior minister said 
the minister petermichael diestel said albrecht had been 
living in east berlin for the past 10 years under an assumed name 
and was married to an east german 
albrecht is accused of killing juergen ponto former head of west 
germanys dresdner bank outside his home in july 1977 in the west 
german city of oberursel just north of frankfurt albrecht was an 
acquaintance of the ponto family 
she is also wanted in connection with the kidnapping and killing 
of west german industrialist hanns martin schleyer 
schleyer the president of west germanys employers and trade 
association was kidnapped on sept 5 1977 when two of his 
bodyguards were cut down in a hail of bullets on a cologne street 
he was held by the red army faction for six weeks before being 
slain 
the red army faction a spinoff of the baadermeinhof gang got 
its start with a series of arson and bombing attacks mainly against 
us military targets in what it said was retaliation for the war 
in vietnam 
it later broadened its attacks staging bombings and slayings of 
west german industrial and banking leaders 
about 25 red army faction members are still being sought the 
west german interior ministry says there are also about 250 
sympathizers who provide hideouts and other support for gang members 
the latest attack claimed by the red army faction was bombing 
death of banker alfred herrhausen on nov 30 herrhausen 59 was 
head of deutsche bank west germanys largest commercial bank he 
was killed when a bomb was detonated under his armored car as he was 
being driven to work from his home in bad homburg 12 miles north of 
frankfurt 
in october 1977 a group of palestinian terrorists hijacked a 
lufthansa plane to mogadishu somalia and demanded the release of 
jailed terrorists belonging to the baadermeinhof group 
the hijackers were overpowered by a west german antiterrorist 
unit on oct 18 1977 after the plane landed in mogadishu 
the pilot of the plane was shot and killed but 89 passengers and 
crew were freed safely of the terrorists four were shot and killed 
and a fifth terrorist was wounded 
a palestinian soraya ansari was later tried and sentenced to 20 
years in prison 
hours after the raid on the plane convicted terrorists andreas 
baader gudrin ensslin and jancarl raspe were found shot to death 
in their prison cells in stammheim prison in stuttgart officials 
said they had committed suicide 
schleyer was found shot to death in the trunk of a car in 
mulhausen france near the border with west germany a short time 
later 
ulrike meinhof who along with andreas baader led the 
baadermeinhof gang of the late 1960s had hanged herself a year 
earlier in prison

onschedule census workers staged a 
sickout today to protest a 2anhour raise given to census takers 
in other parts of the country where the head count is lagging 
seventyfive of about 100 dayshift office workers called in sick 
with the flu but most said they will be better by friday said 
arlin violetta district census manager 
theyre calling it the 2bill blue flu he said the sickout 
affected only michigans upper peninsula where the census count is 
on schedule 
im sure it was in protest to wage increases across the country 
that we did not get violetta said i think its just showing a 
point that if youre doing a rotten job with the census youll get 
a raise if you do a good job you get a slap in the face 
many of the office workers who called in sick earn 450 an hour 
compared with clerks in some districts who earn 7 an hour 
violetta said the raises went only to field workers though 
office workers were not affected the ones in the upper peninsula 
decided to protest anyway 
the raises went to regions that are farthest behind in taking the 
national population count where recruiting and retaining workers 
has been troublesome 
our people went in on skis and snowshoes he said we had a 
snowstorm may 10 and yet we got our job done 
anger over the raises might prompt some sickout participants to 
quit altogether he said 
his workers have completed their first doortodoor survey and 
were scheduled to begin followup field work within two weeks 
violetta said he needs to hire 400 new field workers the sickout 
was likely to slow that process 
i feel bad for my people and ill stand behind them to the end 
i dont think theyre being treated fairly he said 
the census bureau on wednesday announced pay hikes from between 
50 cents and 2 an hour in locations where it has had problems 
attracting staff 
before the pay hikes census workers were paid between 5 and 8 
an hour depending on local wage rates and staff needs 
the raises went to workers in new york boston atlanta the 
washington dc suburbs kansas city san diego los angeles san 
francisco charlotte nc and arizona

democrats on the senate agriculture committee 
say legislation to halt export of pesticides that cant be sold in 
the united states will help american farmers 
by stopping the export of banned and unregistered pesticides 
we will level the playing field for our producers said sen 
patrick leahy dvt chairman of the committee both domestic and 
foreign farmers will be treated the same 
the committee inserted the ban wednesday in its version of the 
1990 farm bill under protest from ranking republican sen richard 
lugar of indiana and other gop members on the committee 
lugar said he didnt think the provision belonged in the 
legislation that establishes the governments agricultural policy 
for the next five years 
sen christopher bond rmo said the legislation could lead to 
loss of jobs at chemical companies that may decide to do their 
manufacturing abroad 
he also said if we phase companies out it would take other 
companies very little time to gear up 
jay vroom president of the national agricultural chemicals 
association said his organization would continue to try to get the 
committee to change certain provisions of the bill 
he said proposed restrictions on experimentation with chemicals 
would be detrimental to us scientific discovery 
we could be shooting ourselves in the foot vroom said 
some companies will move research plants to europe where the 
likelihood is better of moving products around the world unfettered 
during experimentation on crops 
he said many of the unregistered chemicals sold abroad that would 
be banned from export are awaiting approval by the environmental 
protection agency which has a backlog thus they could eventually 
be registered here he said 
other chemicals dont pass the zero tolerance laws in the united 
states for residue but do pass pesticide regulations in other 
countries vroom said 
leahy said that no part of the farm bill generated more mail to 
his office than this one 
at a time when we are toughening our standards at home we need 
to do more about imports with hazardous pesticides he said 
because the food and drug administration waives through virtually 
all imported food without inspection these chemicals often end up 
on americas dinner tables 
about 25 percent of the fruits and vegetables consumed in the 
united states come from abroad 
many of the chemicals that have been banned for health reasons 
were quite effective in eliminating pests and increasing crop yields 
foreign farmers are able to use madeintheusa chemicals that 
our farmers cannot said leahy we effectively penalize us 
farmers and growers for using safe pesticides and obeying the law

us food processors and processingequipment 
makers took a few steps closer to converting the soviet union to the 
capitalistic system during a conference this week 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher signed an agreement wednesday 
with the soviet union that promises that federal officials will work 
with the soviets to find ways to adapt the us food making and 
distribution system to their country 
vladilen nikitin the soviet equivalent to the us agriculture 
secretary said the agreement was a small step but everything 
starts with a small step 
for you its a key if you want to participate in the 
strengthening of our economy he said through an interpreter 
the pact was signed on the last day of a threeday conference 
sponsored by the food processing machinery amp supplies association 
and the national food processors association 
mosbacher said the pact was unprecedented and a start toward 
expanding trade between the two superpowers 
we are the two largest industrialized nations in the world 
said mosbacher we have onethird of the worlds gnp gross 
national product but we do only a tiny fraction of world trade 
john cady president of the food processors association said 
barriers are beginning to come down although americans are 
concerned about getting paid for business with the soviets 
soviet currency is of almost no value in the world market 
leaving those companies doing business in the soviet union to either 
accept products in exchange or wait for longterm gains after the 
economy there improves 
we have to understand when companies invest its not going to 
be a threeyear turnaround but probably eight to 10 years said 
cady 
he said nikitin was a powerful official in the soviet government 
and would smooth the way for american business 
us businessmen at the conference had complained earlier of 
complications in dealing with the soviet bureaucracy

sen wyche fowler dga wants to put his 
agricultural marketing reform legislation into the 1990 farm bill 
the measure would modify the agriculture departments grading 
standards of fruit and vegetables by including flavor sugar content 
and nutritional value as grading criteria 
the current system of some produce relies solely on its exterior 
appearance with no regard for the quality of the fruit or vegetable 
fowler said 
sometimes pesticides are used to enhance the looks of produce 
when external appearance is irrelevant such as in fruits or 
vegetables used by juice makers 
both consumers and farmers will benefit from this amendment 
fowler said wednesday consumers will be eating healthier food 
with less pesticides and farmers will be reducing their costs by 
spending less money on pesticides

government and tamil rebels was violated thursday when insurgents 
opened fire on army trucks in the northeast police and residents 
said

the gunfight at nedunkeri village about 160 miles northeast of 
colombo said police in the area 
at least six rebels were injured when the army returned fire

on condition of anonymity 
it was the most serious confrontation since the tamil tigers 
accepted a government invitation to start talks and declared a 
unilateral ceasefire in may 1989

his group opened fire when the army convoy refused to stop at a 
checkpoint manned by the rebels 
suresh the commander said in a telephone interview that the 
tigers did not suffer any casualties he uses only one name

began sharing law and order duties with sri lankan soldiers and 
policemen 
but there have been strains in the relationship newspapers 
accuse the rebels of assaulting policemen levying illegal taxes and 
blocking roads 
the tigers say the government has stepped up military movement 
and may be gearing up for another bout of fighting 
tamils who make up 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people 
claim they are discriminated against by sinhalese who form 75 
percent of the population and dominate the army and government

seventytwo times they voted and 72 times 
the result was the same frustrated city councilors wound up 
deadlocked in their attempt to elect a fellow council member in a 
special election 
each vote to choose between selden hannah and bernard veno was 
followed by a familiar refrain 
veno 6 hannah 6 
the councilors tried unsuccessfully into the wee hours wednesday 
to fill a seat vacated by councilor ronald laurions death 
hannah and veno beat a third candidate in the first vote but 
choosing between the two left the council stymied until the meeting 
was recessed at 2 am 
the first portent of problems came when the council decided 
after four fruitless secret ballots to take care of the rest of the 
agenda before picking their new colleague they returned to the 
voting at 11 pm tuesday 
after the 15th ballot councilor chuck grassie commended his 
fellow members for helping the citys recycling effort as soda cans 
began lining up on the table 
after the 20th ballot city solicitor danford wensley suggested a 
surefire way to break the deadlock a duel 
after the 27th ballot a motion was made to send a newspaper 
reporter to get doughnuts the motion failed 
later tallies ran into trouble as one weary councilor turned in a 
blank ballot and another count turned up too many votes 
councilor dan moynihan said the record for the greatest number of 
ballots cast was 104 set in the 1920s the council will have 
another chance to break the record june 12 when it plans to resume 
voting on veno and hannah 
the first order of business that evening however is a review of 
the entire city budget

a shift from timber production will mean a 
higher priority over the next five years for recreation and wildlife 
habitats in national forest management agriculture secretary 
clayton yuetter said thursday 
yeutter and us forest service chief f dale robertson unveiled 
a longterm plan for forest and range land resources calling for 
greater environmental sensitivity and a better balance among 
multiple uses of public lands 
the secretary said production levels will be reduced in areas 
where timber and mineral production and livestock grazing cannot be 
accomplished in an environmentally acceptable manner 
we are looking at multipleuse management from a new 
perspective yeutter said during a news conference at the 
agriculture department 
this plan calls for some reductions in timber harvests and 
livestock range grazing in order to enhance and protect the 
ecological balances there he said 
president bush in a formal statement to congress called the 
blueprint an ambitious program that strongly renews my 
commitment to multipleuse management 
the plan which the agriculture department is required to present 
to congress every five years under the resources planning act of 
1974 was hailed by at least one environmental group for placing 
greater emphasis on fishing and wildlife habitats 
in the past they had a telescope on trees period much of the 
emphasis has been on timber and forest products trout unlimited 
executive director robert l herbst said 
leaders of the timber industry condemned the report during a 
tuesday news conference saying the projections are worthless 
because they ignore such critical factors as the anticipated listing 
of the rare northern spotted owl as a threatened species 
the us fish and wildlife service is to decide by june 23 
whether to declare the owl as threatened a move congressmen in the 
pacific northwest say would result logging bans across large 
sections of the region 
yeutter acknowledged the industrys concern that the rpa proposal 
will have to be altered to take the owl into consideration if it is 
listed under the endangered species act but he said that will not 
be done until a formal announcement is made on the owls status 
were not going to do an rpa on the basis of hypotheticals 
he said 
robertson added that timberbased communities should understand 
also that the owl listing could carry significant impacts not 
accounted for in the rpa report 
theres no question were going to have to provide more 
protection for the spotted owl even if its not listed 
robertson said 
timber harvests on national forest lands which averaged 122 
billion board feet from 198388 will fall to about 108 billion 
board feet by 1995 then begin to grow slowly again to about 12 
billion board feet by 2040 the report said

president fw de klerk today 
lifted the 4yearold state of emergency in most of the country and 
challenged black nationalist leaders to respond to his governments 
reforms 
de klerks decision to end repressive emergency measures removes 
a major obstacle to negotiations with the african national congress 
on ending apartheid and giving the black majority a voice in the 
government 
i have decided to announce there will no longer be a general 
countrywide state of emergency but that henceforth it will exist in 
natal province only de klerk said in a speech to parliament 
black factional fighting in the southeastern province of natal 
has left about 500 people dead since the first of the year 
the president also announced that as a goodwill gesture he was 
releasing 48 prisoners convicted of politically motivated crimes 
members of the proapartheid conservative party burst into 
laughter when de klerk began his speech to parliament by saying he 
had received a mandate from white voters for reform 
we are on the threshold of the real negotiation process and the 
time has come for other important role players to do their bit de 
klerk said in particular the anc must now stop vacillating 
many of the emergency regulations are duplicated in existing 
legislation however without the regulations police will no longer 
have immunity from prosecution for any action they take in an unrest 
situation police commissioners lose their power to impose sweeping 
bans on public gatherings they will have to prove the necessity of 
each restriction in court 
police will lose their control over funerals in black townships 
government will not be able to suspend or seize newspapers at will 
police once again will need warrants for most searches and seizures 
the african national congress has said the lifting of the 
emergency the release of prisoners and the return of exiles are the 
main obstacles to full negotiation on a new constitution 
the white house called the lifting of the state of emergency in 
most of south africa a sign of the remarkable progress 
we look forward to the early beginning of a negotiating 
process deputy white house press secretary alixe glen told 
reporters flying aboard air force one with president bush to a 
speaking engagement in milwaukee this is another significant step 
toward creating a climate conducive to negotiations that will lead 
to a democratic nonracial south africa 
de klerk said his government has accepted a joint program on 
those major issues worked out last month by midlevel officials on 
both sides he said he is ready to implement it but the anc has 
said it will not have a response until july 10 
de klerk says he wants the new constitution to allow the 
countrys 28 million blacks to share power with the 5 million whites 
the president today reiterated his call for an end to 
international sanctions against his government 
in paris anc leader nelson mandela called de klerks move a 
victory for the people but he urged the west to maintain the 
economic sanctions 
some south african newspapers have said that by ending the 
emergency now de klerk could be trying to undermine mandela as he 
tours the world calling for continued sanctions 
the emergency laws which included some of the harshest 
restrictions on political activity ever imposed by south africas 
white rulers had to be renewed by midnight friday if they were to 
remain in effect for another year 
more than 30000 activists almost all of them black have been 
detained without trial for varying lengths of time during the 
emergency others went into hiding about 300 remain in detention 
now 
most of the countrys leading newspapers had predicted de klerk 
would lift the decree during his speech to lawmakers a sixhour 
cabinet meeting was held wednesday at which the emergency was 
discussed at length 
de klerks predecessor pw botha declared the nationwide 
emergency on june 12 1986 in a bid to quell mounting black unrest 
de klerk had nullified some of the emergency restrictions as part 
of a series of reforms implemented since he assumed power in august 
he also has released scores of detainees and longterm political 
prisoners 
but de klerk said today the violence in natal province cannot 
be countered with the ordinary laws of the land 
the anc has acknowledged that the violence there is worse than in 
other parts of the country while he has not called for a continued 
state of emergency there mandela has suggested that the government 
use the full force of its military and police to stop the killing 
the main combatants in natal are supporters of the african 
national congress and members of the conservative zulu organization 
inkatha 
an estimated 6000 blacks have died in the past four years 4000 
of them in blackonblack violence in natal but scores have been 
killed in clashes with police including more than 30 deaths in 
recent months 
mandela on a sixweek trip to europe north america and africa 
conferred with french officials today 
the lifting of the emergency decree is what we have fought for 
since the emergency was declared in june 1986 mandela told 
journalists but it doesnt change my mind regarding the need 
for sanctions 
in pressuring for an end to apartheid the united states and 
other countries have restricted trade with and investment in south 
africa 
mandela was freed in february after more than 27 years in south 
african prisons he and de klerk have held preliminary negotiations 
aimed at clearing away obstacles for formal talks 
in his speech today de klerk again challenged mandela to stop 
advocating continued guerrilla activity de klerk criticized 
mandelas statement in botswana earlier this week that the anc 
approves of organized disciplined violence against chosen 
targets 
on two other major issues de klerk held out the prospect of 
reforms soon he said the government is considering changing 
security legislation that could possibly inhibit the free conduct 
of peaceful politics 
he also said the government has started to act on allowing 
thousands of exiles to return home the anc says it has more than 
15000 exiled members 
anticipating de klerks announcement conservative spokesman 
moolman metnz said beforehand that lifting the emergency would cause 
chaos they couldnt cope with the violence even with the state of 
emergency because they were not applying it our view is the 
government is trying to appease everybody

the house voted 294123 today to override 
president bushs veto of a bill authorizing 2 billion for amtrak 
and increasing government power over freight railroad acquisitions 
the override measure went to the senate where the vote was 
expected to be closer a twothirds vote of both houses is required 
to turn back a presidential veto congress has failed to override 
all 10 previous bush vetoes 
bush has said he would support amtrak funding unlike former 
president reagan but objected to increased power to be given the 
interstate commerce commission calling it a step backward for the 
entire rail industry 
democrats argued that the icc already has power over sale of a 
portion of a railroad or sale of more than one railroad to investors 
outside the industry but has decided it cannot scrutinize sale of a 
whole railroad 
house gop leader bob michel of illinois introduced a bill today 
before the veto vote that contained all of the provisions of the 
amtrak legislation except for the icc section 
the president is committed to an adequate passenger rail 
service michel told the house adding that bush would not veto 
the new measure 
the veto has had affected daily train operations because the 
railroad is working with money that congress already had 
appropriated the bill envisions more than 2 billion going to 
amtrak through sept 30 1992 actual amounts will be determined 
when congress appropriates the money 
the veto had threatened plans for a commuter line between 
washington dc and its northern virginia suburbs it contained 
technical provisions necessary for the project to begin 
the measure also contained a provision that would save amtrak 16 
million over two years in unemployment insurance payments for 
railroad workers

the two top senate ethics committee members 
said today there has been no plea bargaining with sen dave 
durenberger in his financial misconduct case and declared the panel 
is ready to begin public hearings next week 
about 200 potential witnesses have been contacted for the panels 
first triallike hearings since 1981 but not all are likely to 
testify in the proceedings that begin tuesday according to 
committee chairman howell heflin dala and vice chairman warren b 
rudman rnh 
durenberger rminn has refused in recent weeks to comment on 
the case which will determine whether his actions broke senate 
rules the senator has appeared before the committee twice in closed 
session but there has been no plea bargaining heflin told a 
news conference 
theres been no plea bargaining here whatsoever rudman 
added were not in the nature of trading 
durenberger had touched off speculation of plea bargaining when 
he said last month that he had been talking informally with the 
committee and that the hearing date served as a deadline for 
reaching a settlement in the case 
the committee previously announced it found substantial 
credible evidence of financial wrongdoing by durenberger who 
previously admitted mistakes in judgment 
some of the allegations cover transactions from 1983 to 1989 
relating to a minneapolis condominium that durenberger partly owned 
and for which he received senate reimbursements 
other charges are connected to money collected by durenberger in 
promoting two books he wrote and his acceptance of free limousine 
rides these alleged violations took place in 1985 and 1986 
a number of facts in the case are not in dispute and heflin said 
the issue of intent is one issue that may be involved among 
many 
the senators said durenberger and his attorney jim hamilton 
and committee special counsel robert bennett could file an 
agreement that certain events took place thus negating the need for 
some testimony 
this is not an easy case rudman said adding there is not 
the kind of tension that you may think 
when the hearings are completed the special counsel will make a 
report to the panel and the committee would then make 
recommendations to the senate if theres a conviction for breaking 
the rules the committee could recommend punishment ranging from a 
reprimand to expulsion although the latter is not likely

an american nurse on thursday 
asked washington to fly in supplies for a hospital she built in my 
lai the village where us troops committed their worst atrocity of 
the vietnam war 
three weeks ago cherie clark and her private international 
mission of hope inaugurated the twostory hospital at my lai where 
soldiers of charlie company shot hundreds of villagers to death in 
1968 
but the hospital remains an empty building the 300000 of 
medical supplies needed to open it are in atlanta and portland and 
the cost of privately transporting them to vietnam is too high said 
ms clark of denver 
ms clark a volunteer nurse in vietnam during the war said 
washington has agreed in principle to take the supplies along when 
space is available on its aircraft going to hanoi vietnams 
capital but it gave no commitment and no supplies have gone thus 
far she said 
the us government has embargoed all trade and official aid to

were saying to the us government give us a break this time 
fly the supplies here the people are suffering all sorts of 
ailments ms clark said in an interview in ho chi minh city 
where she has an office 
ms clark said more than half the children in the my lai area 
about 340 miles northeast of ho chi minh city are malnourished 
she said villagers wept at the inauguration of the hospital 
built by about 100 local laborers on the spot where the us 
helicopters landed on the bloody day in march 1968 the handful of 
survivors recalled how they lay under heaps of bodies she said 
the old men were looking at us and the kids were holding me 
and they wouldnt let go ms clark said 
we wanted to bring health care to them she said we wanted 
them to know that there were different kinds of americans that some 
care even though it was 20 years ago 
they say they cannot forgive but they love the new americans 
who have come back she said 
on march 16 1968 charlie companys first platoon led by lt 
william l calley jr killed at least 175 vietnamese men women and 
children at my lai according to the 1970 report of a us army 
inquiry 
a plaque in the village is inscribed with the names of 504 men 
women and children vietnamese officials say died there 
calley was the only soldier convicted for the massacre at a 
courtmartial in march 1971 he was sentenced to life imprisonment 
following a public outcry thenpresident richard nixon reduced 
his sentence to 20 years and calley actually served just three 
years under house arrest before his conviction was overturned by a 
federal judge 
the united states withdrew from vietnam in 1973 in april 1975 
the south vietnam government it backed fell to communist forces from 
the north 
after vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 washington 
reaffirmed the embargo and the withholding of diplomatic relations 
with hanoi it says that will change only with a political 
resolution of the continuing cambodian war 
the work of ms clark and other private citizens was eased after 
the united states in 1987 pledged to facilitate nongovernment 
humanitarian aid to vietnam in exchange for cooperation on 
resolving the status of about 1800 missing us soldiers

state rep nyla murphy today filed for the 
gop gubernatorial nomination saying she believed republicans should 
have a choice in the primary 
the field of republican candidates has dwindled from more than 
half a dozen to just rancher mary mead that brought accusations 
that gop power brokers were behind meads campaign and had 
successfully discouraged all other contenders for the nomination 
i call them king makers i guess i should say queen makers 
said murphy i think there are some money powers money 
brokers behind the opponents candidacy 
a 12year member of the house of representatives the 59yearold 
murphy from casper said she was approached about two weeks ago to 
oppose mead and that after mulling the idea for about a week 
decided to enter the race 
the state representative refrained from directly attacking mead 
saying she knew little about her mead 54 was an unsuccessful 
candidate for state senator in the 1970s and is a former president 
of the wyoming heritage society she is the daughter of cliff 
hansen a former wyoming governor and us senator in the 1970s 
democratic gov mike sullivan is seeking a second term and is 
opposed by ron suds clingman a firsttime gubernatorial candidate

the senate failed today to break a filibuster 
against an anticrime bill that included curbs on semiautomatic 
weapons and sponsors called for negotiations to save the measure 
from being scuttled 
the vote was 5737 in favor of imposing a time limit on debate 
six short of the 60 votes needed 
the only way were really likely to get a bill is if we can 
enter into negotiations sen joseph r biden jr ddel told 
the senate 
the action represented a victory for the national rifle 
association which opposed the measures gun provisions 
the bill also includes provisions instituting the death penalty 
for 30 federal crimes and is designed to end delays of up to a 
decade in carrying out executions 
it also would allow courts to consider evidence gathered with 
flawed warrants in some cases 
democratic leaders said debating each of 300 amendments waiting 
in the hopper would fuel a filibuster with endless delays they said 
in advance of the vote that failure to impose a 30hour time limit 
would kill the bill 
biden chairman of the judiciary committee and the measures 
floor manager took the floor minutes after the vote and declared 
that it had been do or die time for the crime bill and it just 
died 
within two hours however biden returned to say he was 
confident our staffs can literally in a matter of an hour or so 
bring to a resolution all the remaining issues 
i feel we can reach an agreement on one or two other provisions 
and pass this bill said sen strom thurmond rsc one of the 
measures handful of republican supporters i think we can 
work it out 
on the roll call 11 republicans joined 46 democrats in voting 
for a time limit seven democrats and 30 republicans opposed it 
republican leader bob dole of kansas urged the senate to push 
ahead with action on the bill even without a limit on debate this 
is an important bill he declared if we want a crime bill 
the majority can have one 
biden blamed the national rifle association for the surge of 
amendments the gun group had been widely expected to win a senate 
battle two weeks ago to drop restrictions on semiautomatic assault 
weapons 
in a surprise move the senate rejected a move to drop the curbs 
biden said the nra hoped to block final action on the bill by 
encouraging lawmakers to let debate flow on indefinitely 
the campaign to curb such weapons began in january 1989 after a 
deranged man with an assault rifle opened fire on a stockton 
calif school yard leaving five youngsters dead and 30 other 
persons hurt 
the nra as well as federal firearms experts say however that 
the socalled assault weapons differ only in their military styling 
from normal semiautomatic hunting rifles with their traditional 
brown wooden stocks 
nra lobbyist david conover said wednesday the group sent out 
targeted alerts to half a dozen to eight states to a portion of 
our membership in each state urging them to press senators to 
vote against shutting off debate 
he stressed the political dividends lawmakers see in keeping 
alive a death penalty measure with voters aroused over the issue

manuel h johnson unexpectedly announced his 
resignation thursday from the no 2 job at the federal reserve 
creating a key opening at an agency often criticized by the bush 
administration for keeping interest rates too high 
johnson 41 said he planned to return to an academic career 
the aug 3 departure will give president bush the chance to make 
another appointment to the sevenmember board that directs the 
nations monetary policy 
the administration at various times in past months has been 
openly critical of the feds efforts to restrain inflation by 
keeping interest rates high 
there was a published report in march quoting an unnamed bush 
adviser as saying the president was mad as hell with federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and would not reappoint him as 
chairman 
bush later insisted there was no bubbling war with greenspan 
but left the clear impression he would like to see more aggressive 
action on the part of the fed to lower interest rates 
analysts said it was likely that bush would appoint someone to 
the fed who would be more amenable to the administrations pleas for 
lower interest rates 
this administration has been jawboning the fed on and off for 
some time for a looser monetary policy said kenneth guenther of 
the independent bankers association of america they want lower 
interest rates because they dont want the economy moving into a 
recession 
fed officials have been pursuing a softlanding approach for 
the economy in which interest rates are used to slow growth enough 
to ease inflationary pressures but not enough to tip the country 
into a recession 
many analysts believe that approach is working and that the fed 
is unlikely to change course even with a new vice chairman appointed 
by bush 
the fed isnt closely divided now where one vote in either 
direction would make much of a difference said lyle gramley a 
former fed governor and now chief economist of the mortgage bankers 
association 
the administration had no immediate comment on johnsons 
departure the president will have the opportunity to either name 
someone new to the board and designate that person as vice chairman 
or select one of the other governors as vice chairman while 
appointing someone else to fill johnsons board term which runs 
until aug 21 2000 
there was speculation that david mullins appointed to the fed 
earlier this year might be considered for the vice chairmans job 
mullins one of the authors of the savings and loan bailout 
legislation had been a top assistant to treasury secretary nicholas 
brady 
johnson was appointed to the fed by president reagan on feb 7 
1986 and was elevated to vice chairman six months later 
he said his resignation would be effective at the end of his 
fouryear term as vice chairman 
i am extremely proud to have played a part in the unprecedented 
period of sustained economic growth and low inflation that has 
characterized the decade of the 1980s and continues into the 
1990s johnson said in his letter of resignation 
johnson said he planned to return to george mason university in 
washingtons virginia suburbs and assume the koch chair in 
international economics and become director of the center for global 
market studies 
he was a professor at the school in 1981 when he was selected to 
join the economics team assembled by thentreasury secretary donald 
regan in reagans first term 
i deeply regret but understand manley johnsons decision 
greenspan said in a statement the vice chairman and i have been 
an effective team ill miss him 
the fed the nations central bank headquartered in washington 
is run by the board of governors and a nationwide network of 12 
district banks the governors are appointed by the president and 
confirmed by the senate to serve 14year terms

president bush in his first speech since the 
superpower summit today praised president mikhail s gorbachev as 
a remarkable man helping to usher in a new era in ussoviet 
relations 
bush made the remarks at a republican luncheon here for gov 
tommy thompson on the first stop of a fourstate midwestern swing by 
the president to raise money for gop candidates 
en route to milwaukee on air force one a white house statement 
welcomed the lifting of the 4yearold state of emergency in most of 
south africa 
we welcome the announcement said deputy press secretary 
alixe glen this is another significant step toward creating a 
climate conducive to negotiations that will lead to a democratic 
nonracial south africa 
but even as bush shifted his attention to domestic politics he 
was looking back at what he called a very productive washington 
summit 
bush ran down a list of arms and trade agreements that he and 
gorbachev signed he said even on the tough issues that the summit 
did not solve such as german membership in nato and the future of 
the baltic states they made progress with the candor of their 
discussions 
of course we have differences i want to see lithuania have 
its freedom we are committed to selfdetermfination for the baltic 
states although i am pleased that the emigration of soviet jews 
is at an alltime high i want to see unfettered emigration he 
said 
we have differences on cuba and for now on a united germany 
in nato and on many other issues as well added bush 
but as i chatted informally with president gorbachev at camp 
david i kept thinking that this new soviet leader committed to 
reform and openness is indeed a remarkable man he said 
he praised the soviet leader for the forthright spirit in which 
he addressed every issue on the table and i take it as proof that 
we have indeed entered a new era in our relations with the soviet 
union 
bush also had stops planned in illinois iowa and nebraska today 
and friday to campaign for us senate and gubernatorial contenders 
in both wisconsin and iowa the thorny issue of abortion promises 
to figure prominently in the november campaigns 
thompson is considered in strong shape in a wellfunded 
reelection bid against fourterm democratic assembly speaker thomas 
loftus 
after the milwaukee luncheon bush was heading to chicago to put 
his prestige behind one of the gops toppriority governors races 
secretary of state jim edgars bid against democratic state attorney 
general neil hartigan to succeed outgoing republican gov james r 
thompson 
the party hopes the presidents campaign efforts in illinois also 
will provide a boost to rep lynn martins tough battle against 
incumbent democratic sen paul simon 
as is the white house custom of combining public events with 
political trips with the taxpayers paying for the presidential 
events and the republican party sharing costs for political portions 
bush also had a series of education and other policyoriented 
appearances 
the white house is planning increasingly frequent campaign trips 
for bush as the november election nears 
this is the type of thing the president will do a lot of 
said a national party official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the best thing the president can do now is to provide material 
resources for these candidates by appearing at highpriced 
fundraisers 
on wednesday the president met with south korean president roh 
taewoo to discuss rohs talks in san francisco with gorbachev after 
the soviet leader left washington on sunday 
when he returns to washington on friday night bush will host 
west german chancellor helmut kohl for further postsummit 
consultations 
on friday bush will be in des moines for incumbent gov terry 
branstad who will be feted at a 150aticket breakfast and also 
benefit from a 2000perperson private gathering with bush 
abortion has emerged as an issue in branstads forthcoming race 
against house speaker don avenson selected by democrats on tuesday 
as their nominee as well as in the states senate contest 
democratic sen tom harkin is prochoice and his republican 
challenger rep tom tauke is antiabortion 
avenson credited his prochoice position for his victory over an 
antiabortion primary opponent and said he will campaign on the 
issue against branstad as well 
in wisconsin democrat loftus said he also plans to make abortion 
an issue against thompson loftus claims thompson has been 
unsympathetic to feminist causes 
thompson endorses abortion in cases of incest rape and when the 
mothers life is threatened he also supported a proposal that would 
have required unemancipated girls under 18 to have the consent of at 
least one parent or a judge before obtaining an abortion 
bush has made a point as president of opening the doors of the 
gop to both prochoice and antiabortion backers he opposes 
abortion except in cases of rape incest or threat to the mothers 
life 
from iowa bush goes to nebraska for an omaha luncheon for senate 
contender hal daub recruited by the republicans to take on twoterm 
incumbent james exon daub a former congressman lost his bid for 
the gop nomination against former sen david karnes in the states

ethiopian rebels claimed thursday they had 
killed 1870 government troops in two days of fighting early this 
week near a strategic town north of the capital 
the ethiopian peoples revolutionary democratic front in a 
clandestine broadcast said 1990 soldiers were wounded in the 
battles south of dessie the heavily defended capital of wollo 
province 
the front is a combined force of the tigre peoples liberation 
front and the ethiopian peoples democratic movement a much smaller 
group 
the broadcast monitored in kenyas capital nairobi said the 
fighting took place sunday and monday about 90 miles north of addis 
ababa 
both the rebels and president mengistu haile mariams government 
claimed victories in the same area last week 
it was impossible to verify either claim because the war zone is 
generally inaccessible to journalists and other independent 
witnesses 
if the rebels claim thursday is true the insurgents would be 
only six miles south of dessie the town is at the junction of a 
major road northeast to ethiopias red sea port of assab 
dessie is also the main depot for emergency food being 
distributed to famine victims in wollo and tigre provinces 
the food is trucked from assab the only port in government hands 
since rebels captured massawa in february 
the eritreans are fighting a threedecade war for the 
independence of ethiopias northermost province of eritrea 
the tigreans have been fighting for 15 years seeking mengistus 
ouster and the establishment of a hardline marxist state they took 
control of tigre province early last year

displaced homemakers often face poverty and 
limited job opportunities a private group said thursday 
if you choose homemaking youre choosing a very highrisk 
occupation said jill miller executive director of the national 
displaced homemakers network 
women forced to seek jobs outside the home after spending years 
as fulltime homemakers often lack training and have to take 
parttime seasonal jobs miller said 
the number of displaced homemakers rose 12 percent over the past 
decade from 139 million in 1980 to 156 million in 1989 according 
to a report by the washingtonbased group based on census bureau 
figures 
displaced homemakers are women whose main job was homemaking but 
who lost their key source of income through widowhood divorce 
separation or because a spouse suffered disability or longterm 
unemployment 
we are penalizing homemakers and leaving them high and dry 
when they make that choice she said noting that other workers 
are eligible for unemployment benefits 
nearly three in five displaced homemakers were living near or 
below the poverty level the report said about one in five or 3 
million american women are living in households with other 
families it said 
the group said there were 22 million american married women in 
1989 who were fulltime homemakers

the soviet union and united states may agree 
this year on an experimental program for increasing each sides 
observation of the others antimissile defense work a senior us 
negotiator said thursday 
david smith chief us delegate to the geneva negotiations on 
defense and space told reporters such an accord was possible as 
early as this year but he saw little likelihood of completing a 
formal treaty on the use of spacebased defenses against strategic 
ballistic missiles within the next two years 
he said there was no official target date for completing the 
defense and space treaty which in the us view would govern a 
gradual transition by both countries from offensive to defensive 
means of deterring nuclear war but the soviets dont accept that 
concept saying it would lead to a new more expensive more 
dangerous and unpredictable arms race in space 
smith said the experimental program as proposed by the united 
states would be an important sign of progress in the geneva talks 
which have been bogged down lately 
the united states has proposed an executive agreement on 
predictability measures designed to build confidence in both 
washington and moscow that neither side is trying to conceal its 
intentions in researching spacebased dcist running hard in arkansas and 
a charismatic exklan 
leader seeking to represent louisiana in the us senate 
while mainstream candidates denounce the extremist views some 
civil rights officials voice concern 
they see a fearful trend in the candidacies of jb stoner and 
ralph forbes who seek nominations for lieutenant governor in 
georgia and arkansas and are especially troubled by david dukes 
run for the senate in louisiana 
this is part of a new strategy that the white supremacists have 
developed to work within the electoral system while at the same 
time building their underground operation says eva sears of the 
center for democratic renewal an atlantabased organization that 
monitors the ku klux klan and similar groups 
the klan has elected members to congress and to many state 
offices in the past but those who watch white supremacists say 
their strategies have evolved and the stakes have gone up 
whats new is the extent of the support that theyre getting 
says irwin suall of the antidefamation league of bnai brith in 
new york 
financial support votes suall continues the amount seems 
to be sufficient to take them out of the category of fringe 
candidate 
duke who left the klan to lead the national association for the 
advancement of white people has reported receiving nearly 600000 
in donations to his campaign for the gop nomination for the seat now 
held by sen bennett johnston duke insists hes now merely a 
champion of whites civil rights not a white supremacist 
forbes a former american nazi leader won 46 percent of the vote 
in last months primary for the gop nomination for arkansas 
lieutenant governor a runoff is set for tuesday 
the numbers that ralph forbes polled will be used time and 
time and time again to show that people do sympathize with the views 
of white supremacists says pat clark who heads klanwatch a 
monitoring group in montgomery ala 
the balloting figures will become a recruiting tool she 
says its not necessary always to have a definite victory in the 
sense of being elected 
indeed victory often has been elusive since the klans electoral 
successes of the 1920s when as university of florida history 
professor david chalmers puts it the ku klux klan elected 
senators and governors literally from maine to california 
even president warren harding agreed to be sworn in as a kkk 
member in a white house ceremony according to another scholar wyn 
craig wade in his klan history the fiery cross 
but at that time the klan was at its height with an estimated 5 
million members now monitoring groups say there are perhaps 5000 
kkk members and 17000 or so americans who belong to other racist 
organizations 
thats part of the reason why some thought dukes 1989 victory on 
his third try for a seat in the louisiana legislature was 
significant 
it propelled people to think ok now weve seen it be 
successful lets try it once more weve definitely seen more 
people jump on the bandwagon says ms clark 
it was the first time theyve been able to successfully elect 
people to office since the demise of jim crow in the 1960s says 
leonard zeskind research director of the center for democratic 
renewal 
these guys ran for office before but they never had this 
kind of strategy of being a hardcore white supremacist and passing 
yourself off as a righttolifer or antiaffirmative action 
duke in a telephone inteview from baton rouge says hes been 
misunderstood and maligned but he agrees with civil rights 
officials that a victory in the us senate race oct 6 would 
reverberate far beyond louisiana 
i think a senate victory would send a message to elected 
officials across america that theyve got to start listening to the 
majority duke sayswhen im elected with my admittedly 
controversial background its going to make it easier for other 
people to begin to talk about the issues that im speaking about 
asked about photos of himself in nazi garb duke dismisses them 
as part of a college stunt when he picketed a leftwing campus 
speaker 
asked about statements attributed to him in his own naawp news 
such as the media is dominated by jews not good americans 
and north americans and europeans are like islands of light in a 
hungry and backward third world sea duke says now i believe 
in freedom i dont believe in forced integration and i also 
dont believe in forced segregation i believe in less 
government 
asked about his leadership of a klan group he notes that was 12 
years ago 
i think i have a right to change and develop just like anybody 
else he says 
he adds that many of his views differ from those of forbes who 
was once his campaign manager and of stoner 
forbes running against a black candidate in the runoff recently 
reiterated his belief that racial separation is ultimately the 
right answer 
a minister forbes cites the bible in support of his views 
his runoff opponent kenneth muskie harris speculates that 
forbes might have placed first in the primary because although he 
wasnt wellknown he had better name recognition than his two 
opponents and his name was listed first on the ballot his former 
membership in the nazi party also was not widely known among voters 
as for stoner who served a prison term for bombing a black 
church in alabama in 1958 his antiblack and antisemitic campaign 
rhetoric has prompted some fellow democratic candidates to threaten 
to boycott joint appearances 
analysts give stoner no chance of winning in the july 17 primary 
but say racist candidates may tap into a backlash among some white 
voters 
wayne parent a professor of political science at louisiana state 
university who has followed dukes career says he and other 
candidates represent the remnants of george wallaceism and hope 
to take advantage of voter resentment of changes in society brought 
on by the civil rights movement 
duke has been denied official republican sanction but as far 
as making those republicans turn to the right he seems to have had 
some success parent says because his message is selling better 
than people thought 
jane hardisty director of the cambridge massbased political 
research associates which studies the political right wing says 
white supremacists have devoted themselves to politics more 
seriously since a series of arrests in the 1980s effectively set 
back the violent approach as the medium for the message 
voiced by politicians who carry no guns and wear no robes the 
message still has a waiting audience she says 
if youre in a position where your standard of living is 
falling you have job insecurity that you didnt use to have youre 
looking for an explanation for that ms hardisty says 
and theyre providing a fairly simple easy scapegoat blame 
it on some specific group the jews or the blacks whoever 
resentment among the electorate and the increasing sophistication 
of white supremacist candidates make a formidable combination that 
is hard to disentangle says ms sears of the center for democratic 
renewal 
if you had a big fire how much of it was the dry wood and how 
much was the gasoline

lower back pain is better remedied by a good 
stretch than expensive electronic gadgetry according to a study 
published thursday 
the results of the study indicate that widely used transcutaneous 
electrical nerve stimulation or tens appears to be no more 
effective than a placebo said dr richard a deyo lead author of 
the study published in the new england journal of medicine 
it appeared to do nothing in our study it was a resounding 
negative result the university of washington researcher told 
reporters wednesday 
a major manufacturer of the devices empi corp of st paul 
minn criticized the study saying the 30day length was not long 
enough 
other studies done over a longer time frame have reinforced our 
belief that tens devices are an effective lowcost alternative to 
narcotic drug therapy and surgery for many pain sufferers donald 
maurer empi chairman said 
tens units about the size of a personal cassette player are 
carried on the belt they include wires with electrodes placed on 
the skin in the area of pain deyo said they cost about 500 and 
have been used for about 20 years 
he said use of tens resulted from the belief that 
counterstimulation of the nervous system could modify perception of 
pain like rubbing a bump on the head 
it was later believed that tens lowfrequency highamplitude 
electrical stimulation could raise the level of opiatelike 
substances endorphins in the spinal fluid 
but little clinical evidence existed on the machines 
effectiveness the researchers who also included doctors at the 
university of texas health science center at san antonio ran 
clinical tests using 145 patients with chronic back pain from 1985 
to 1987 in san antonio 
they were broken into four groups tens plus exercise tens 
alone exercise with sham tens and sham tens alone 
all four groups reported significant improvement after two and 
four weeks of participation but had relapsed by the twomonth 
followup 
there were no clinically important or statistically significant 
differences in any outcome between the subjects receiving true tens 
and those receiving sham tens the study concluded 
by contrast the analysis of the effects of exercise showed an 
advantage of exercise in several outcomes including reduction in 
reported frequency of pain 
deyos advice try exercise first and be persistent he said 
those working at exercise to help chronic back pain should expect no 
quick fixes but should see improvements over time 
he also advised against surgery for muscleoriented pain and 
against powerful medications 
he said tens may be effective for acute pain or pain in other 
parts of the body but he said he hoped the research would prompt 
others to study the tens effectiveness 
the study said americans spend 13 billion each year on lower 
back pain treatments athough no estimate of national expenditures 
for tens is available deyo said the veterans administration in 1986 
spent 2 million to purchase them 
deyo is director of health services research and development at 
the seattle veterans affairs medical center as well as a university 
of washington associate professor of medicine and health services 
he said he expected a public relationstype assault against 
the study adding that a halfdozen manufacturers of tens devices do 
business in the united states 
others involved in the study included dr nicholas walsh 
chairman of the department of physical medicine rehabilitation at 
the university of texas dr donald martin at the university of 
washington and drs lawrence schoenfeld and somayaji ramamurthy at 
the university of texas

president fw de klerks 
lifting of the national state of emergency was welcomed thursday by 
world leaders but drew some domestic criticism for going too far 
or not far enough 
the african national congress the black nationalist group that 
has spearheaded the antiapartheid movement called the government 
actions half measures 
rightwing whites on the other hand intensified their 
criticisms of de klerk 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar called de klerks 
move a positive development and the white house hailed the move 
as a sign of the remarkable progress being made in south africa 
de klerk lifted the 4yearold emergency in most of the country 
but retained the rules in violencetorn natal province and the zulu 
homeland 
anc leader walter sisulu said the state of emergency had done 
nothing to stop the fighting in natal sisulu told a news conference 
that if de klerk wants to create the right climate for negotiations 
on ending apartheid the emergency should be lifted in the troubled 
eastern province as well 
we are not asking for half measures sisulu said what we 
have asked for is to clear the atmosphere to negotiations that was 
not done 
sisulu said natal violence could be eased with the lifting of the 
state of emergency and by the government taking positive steps to 
prevent police brutality in the area 
in paris anc leader nelson mandela also criticized the decision 
to retain the state of emergency in natal he also said it was still 
too early to end international sanctions against south africa 
still he called the lifting of the state of emergency a 
victory for the people both black and white 
about 4000 blacks have died in violence in natal during the past 
four years the main combatants are supporters of the anc and 
members of inkatha a relatively conservative zulu organization 
inkatha leader mangosuthu buthelezi who heads the zulu homeland 
government said it was lamentably tragic that the emergency 
remained in force in natal 
i find it politically altogether unacceptable that i who 
was among the first to declare his readiness to negotiate now finds 
himself locked into an emergencyridden region buthelezi said 
the anc also wants the government to repeal security laws that 
still allow detention without trial even though the emergency decree 
has been lifted 
anyone of us in this room can be detained now said anc 
official mohammed valli moosa who was detained three times during 
the emergency the de facto situation on the ground in the 
townships doesnt really change 
meanwhile the proapartheid conservative party said the end of 
the emergency would lead to chaos elsewhere in the country 
they the government couldnt cope with the violence even with 
the state of emergency because they were not applying it said 
moolman mentz a spokesman for the conservatives our view is the 
government is trying to appease everybody 
the south african chamber of business praised de klerks action 
calling it an important step toward national reconciliation it 
said stability was essential for business and investment in south 
africa 
de klerk wants to work out a new constitution with opposition 
groups that will lead to powersharing between the 5 million whites 
and 28 million blacks who currently have no voice in national 
affairs

north carolina led the nation in acts of 
violence vandalism and harassment against homosexuals in 1989 a 
year during which such episodes were prevalent nationwide according 
to a survey of gay organizations 
a total of 7031 incidents of antigay violence or harassment 
occurred last year in 40 states and the district of columbia 
according to the report antigay violence victimization amp 
defamation in 1989 of those 1204 took place in north carolina 
the survey found 
these attacks occurred in a context of widespread violence 
against jews people of color and women said kevin berrill the 
reports author and director of the antiviolence project at the 
national gay amp lesbian task force 
he cited the death of yusuf hawkins a black youth killed by 
whites in brooklyn ny the firebombing of the san diego jewish 
times the beating death of an asian in raleigh nc and racist 
bombings in birmingham ala and savannah ga that killed a 
federal judge and a civil rights lawyer 
hate crimes exist because the narrowminded and meanspirited 
among us have judged some of their fellow citizens to be less 
deserving of respect than themselves sen alan cranston 
dcalif said at a news conference to release the report the 
more that we bring these crimes to light the less tolerable they 
will be 
berrill said antigay violence remains largely hidden he said 
gay people should report such crimes he also called on more states 
to pass hate crimes laws similar to the federal hate crimes 
statistics act signed in april by president bush 
the report said hate crime laws with antigay provisions recently 
passed in california connecticut the district of columbia iowa 
minnesota new hampshire oregon and vermont they also were adopted 
in atlanta burlington iowa montgomery county md and st louis 
the report said 
in durham nc jill duvall executive director of gay amp lesbian 
health project said she believed antigay incidents were on the 
rise in part because of aids backlash nevertheless she said many 
of the crimes go unreported in north carolina because of the states 
sodomy law 
gay people are afraid to go to local police because of 
treatment in the past there have been people that have gone to 
police stations that have been told they are breaking a felony 
statute she said 
the data for the survey came from questionnaires sent to 650 gay 
activists and organizations nationwide the task force acknowledged 
its methods were unscientific and noted that more than half the 
groups that responded in 1988 did not do so in 1989 however the 
survey is designed to give a broad look at the prevalence of 
antigay incidents

black leader nelson mandela said thursday that 
easing sanctions as a reward for the neartotal lifting of south 
africas state of emergency would be a stab in the back for the 
antiapartheid movement 
mandela in paris on the first stop of a sixweek international 
trip said president fw de klerks decision to lift the emergency 
in all but one province was a victory for all the people black 
and white 
but asked at a news conference if south africas government 
should be rewarded by an easing of economic sanctions mandela 
replied that would be a grave mistake it would be regarded by 
the people of south africa as a stab in back 
mandela also expressed regret that the emergency remained in 
force in natal province where black political factions have been 
battling 
one of the main purposes of mandelas trip to europe the united 
states and canada is to urge western leaders to maintain sanctions 
despite de klerks reforms 
the 71yearold african national congress leader freed in 
february after more than 27 years in prison said french president 
francois mitterrand assured him during private talks that france 
would keep its sanctions in place 
he made an unequivocal statement that the french government 
supports sanctions until fundamental irreversible changes take 
place in south africa mandela told scores of journalists covering 
his first visit to france 
according to french officials mandela urged mitterrand during 
their 30minute meeting to lobby other european leaders to keep 
existing sanctions in effect 
mandela and de klerk have held preliminary negotiations aimed at 
clearing away obstacles including the state of emergency so that 
formal talks can begin on a new constitution that would extend 
political rights to the black majority 
during a meeting with paris mayor jacques chirac a former 
premier mandela said a new south african constitution should not 
entrench special legal protection for the white minority 
nowhere in europe does one find this idea that the rights of a 
particular minority must be safeguarded mandela said our 
position is that whats good for europe is good for us 
mandela also met thursday with georges marchais 
secretarygeneral of the french communist party and with premier 
michel rocard 
on wednesday evening mitterrand and his wife danielle joined 
mandela and his wife winnie at an outdoor concert held in 
mandelas honor at the place du trocadero across the seine river 
from the eiffel tower 
the two couples stood shoulder to shoulder in the rain as an 
ensemble of 100 whitejacketed violinists played god bless 
africa the anthem of the antiapartheid movement 
mandela making his third and most extensive foreign trip since 
his release from prison visits switzerland next followed by west 
germany italy canada the united states ireland and great 
britain as well as several african countries he returns home july 
18 his 72nd birthday 
de klerk since taking office in august has moved to dismantle 
several segregation laws lifted a 30year ban on the african 
national congress and freed dozens of jailed anc members including 
48 on thursday 
mandela however contends that foreign pressure should be 
maintained because de klerks government has not yet addressed the 
black majoritys basic demand of a oneperson onevote political 
system 
de klerk visted mitterrand and other western euorpean leaders 
during a ninenation 18day trip last month mitterrand told de 
klerk the status of sanctions would be discussed at a european 
community summit meeting in dublin ireland on june 2526

defense secretary dick cheney next week will 
give budget negotiators a thumbnail sketch showing the effect 
various defense cut proposals will have on the armed services his 
spokesman said thursday 
its to help them focus on the budget debate said 
pentagon spokesman pete williams it is not a budget offer its 
not a recipe its not a plan for reductions in the nations armed 
forces 
cheneys study will begin with a look at a possible 25 percent 
reduction in the armed forces over the next five fiscal years 
williams said he also will outline the effects of the far deeper 
defense spending cuts sought by the house and senate 
the 25 percent force cut williams said would be the kind of 
ballpark reduction that cheney and gen colin powell chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff have been speaking about over the long 
term as the defense budget is reduced 
the pentagon may well end up making those reductions in the 
force over the years given the current drive to reduce spending 
williams said adding that such decisions had not been made 
defense experts on capitol hill have complained for months about 
blanks in cheneys fiscal 1991 budget pressing him to come up 
with longterm spending needs so lawmakers can make decisions about 
the administrations 3033 billion spending proposal 
cheney met wednesday with white house and congressional budget 
negotiators who are trying to limit next years budget deficit they 
said later that the report would produce figures to be used for 
bargaining but was not an indication that such a cut was 
inevitable 
after that session cheney said he was sticking to the 
administrations proposal to spend 3033 billion for the military 
in fiscal 1991 which starts oct 1 thats a slight increase over 
the 1990 budget 
under the housepassed budget defense spending would be limited 
to 2954 billion while the senate budget committee has approved a 
2939 billion level 
cheneys report will examine a 25 percent reduction in forces 
not a 25 percent reduction in budget williams said 
its intended to be a kind of a thumbnail sketch of the 
possible outcome of the departments current sixyear defense plan 
reviews he said 
budget negotiators want to limit next years budget deficit to 
64 billion the target set by the grammrudman law the sessions so 
far have focused on technical issues and actual bargaining is at 
least a week away

authorities caught one of the most notorious 
terrorist suspects in west german history and said thursday she 
lived for years as a homemaker in east germany perhaps with the 
approval of the old communist regime 
east german authorities arrested susanne albrecht 39 in front 
of her apartment in east berlin on wednesday ending a 13year hunt 
for a woman believed to be a key member of the leftist red army 
faction 
the red army faction is blamed for assassinations and arson and 
bombing attacks in west germany since the 1970s the latest attack 
in november killed the countrys leading banker 
miss albrecht has been accused in the 1977 slaying of juergen 
ponto the head of dresdner bank west germanys secondlargest 
she also has been linked to the kidnapping and murder that year of 
wealthy industrialist hanns martin schleyer 
miss albrecht did not resist arrest and was unarmed interior 
minister petermichael diestel said she produced her 
identification which had the phony name of ingrid jaeger he said 
she also had a special travel visa that allowed her more travel 
freedom than other east germans under the former communist regime 
he said 
diestel said miss albrecht had been a resident of east berlin for 
the past 10 years and was married to an east german man he said she 
had a child who apparently was born in east berlin 
she had been employed for the last two years as a laboratory 
worker in another country but maintained a residence in east berlin 
diestel said 
chief detective wolfgang pauleit told reporters he presumed that 
she was on vacation from her job and returned because she wanted to 
be in east germany for the economic union with west germany 
diestel would not give the age or gender of miss albrechts child 
or details about her husband nor would he identify the country in 
which she had been working 
the west german tabloid bild in a report made available in 
advance of publication friday said miss albrecht had been in the 
soviet union and was an operative for east germanys former secret 
police the newspaper gave no attribution 
it said she was exposed when the vast files of the former secret 
police network were examined by the countrys new democratic 
government 
there has been much speculation about the wealth of information 
in the 6 million secret police files and whether there is proof 
that the former communist government sponsored leftist terrorism 
diestel said there was no evidence miss albrecht worked for the 
secret police 
but he said he could not rule out the possibility that she was 
living in east germany with the approval or knowledge of the 
hardline communist government which was ousted amid massive 
prodemocracy protests in october 
the red army faction got its start with a series of arson and 
bombing attacks in the early 1970s most were aimed at the us 
military for american involvement in vietnam 
about 25 red army faction members were still being sought up to 
the time of albrechts arrest 
the latest attack claimed by the red army faction was the nov 30 
bombing death of alfred herrhausen head of deutsche bank west 
germanys largest commercial bank he was killed when a bomb was 
detonated under his armored car as he was being driven to work

the nations top health official portrayed 
animal rights activists thursday as terrorists and said their 
tactics jeopardize the future of diseasecuring experiments 
animal research has saved millions of human lives said 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan it is an 
integral part of mankinds striving for the betterment of humanity 
i am saddened and a bit angry that we have to put up with major 
disruptions to science by socalled animal activists who are in 
fact nothing more than animal rights terrorists he said 
animal rights activists who plan to march sunday in the nations 
capital responded that sullivans remarks were appalling they 
said he was ignoring the continuing exploitation of laboratory 
animals that suffer needlessly while alternative non animal testing 
methods are available 
sullivan was joined at a news conference by officials from the 
association of american medical colleges actor david birney who is 
a national spokesman for the american diabetes association rep vin 
weber rminn and parents of children who have benefited from 
medical procedures that evolved from animal experiments also 
participating were representatives of the beef dairy poultry and 
other industries dependent on animals 
sullivan said that virtually everyone agrees that unnecessary 
animal research or the cruel use of animals is wrong 
he added however that the federal government has in place 
regulations that ensure that research animals are treated humanely 
and that we do everything possible to reduce any pain or 
discomfort that results from experiments he said cruel treatment 
of animals by research scientists was very rare 
birney who played the role of a doctor on the television series 
st elsewhere ticked off a list of medical advances that have 
resulted from animal research including insulin for diabetics 
antibiotics organ transplants drug therapies and skin grafts 
without animal research many of us in this room would be 
dead he said 
len koch chairman of the incurably ill for animal research said 
the activists used lies distortion and misinformation to wage 
a sophisticated campaign that is costing taxpayers millions of 
dollars 
medical schools are spending about 6 million a year for damage 
to labs attacked by animal rights protesters and additional security 
to prevent further disruption of their experiments said dr l 
thompson bowles an official of the association of american medical 
colleges 
the annual cost to the federal government is about 12 million 
said dr frederick goodwin administrator of the alcohol drug abuse 
and mental health administration 
rep weber said the issue is not about cruelty to animals but 
about abuse and harassment of scientists conducting lifesaving 
experiments 
animal rights groups constitute a strong growing powerful 
political movement he said there is no political movement in 
my judgment that more directly threatens the health and quality of 
life of the american people in the 1990s than the animal rights 
movement 
but ingrid newkirk national director of the people for the 
ethical treatment of animals said statements by sullivan the others 
were appalling an attempt to gloss over all the exposes of 
terrible cruelties fraud and unnecessary use of animals in 
research 
i am morally opposed to the exploitation of any individual or 
group of individuals who cannot fight for themselves she said 
and so i believe there is always a way if you look to get 
information without using animals 
neal barnard president of the physicians committee for 
responsible medicine said sullivan was wrong in claiming animal 
abuse in labs was rare he pointed as an example to a 21 million 
army study in which 700 cats were shot in the head with bullets and 
a surgical companys practice of killing dogs to train its 
salespeople how to use surgical staples 
we are still dealing with the outer crust of cruelty and 
waste barnard said i would encourage sullivan to deal with 
the ugly cases that are still there 
barnard said that among the alternatives to animal testing are 
experiments in which cultures of human cells are grown in the 
laboratory tests on these cells though still imperfect are faster 
and more appropriate than testing with animals he said 
im concerned that dr sullivan isnt thinking he said i 
dont think hes looked at the opportunities for improvement

officials from 17 western nations agreed thursday to 
lift export restrictions on some hightechnology products and opened 
the way for preferential treatment for east european nations 
previously denied access to western technology 
the coordinating committee for multilateral export controls 
known as cocom agreed to delete 30 of 116 items from its 
restricted list effective july 1 us officials said this will 
make the items available to all nations including the soviet union 
cocom will seek to eliminate eight more items by midaugust and 
reduce restricted items to a core list of highly strategic items 
by the end of the year 
delegates at the twoday meeting also agreed that east european 
countries that adopt appropriate safeguards could become 
eligible for preferential treatment 
we believe these countries are future candidates for deletion 
from the cocom list of proscribed destinations a us statement 
said 
allan wendt senior state department representative for strategic 
technology policy said poland hungary and czechoslovakia would 
likely be the first to benefit from a preferred status with the 
group 
east germany pending full political unification with west 
germany will benefit from a greatly reduced list of export 
controls and improved licensing protections officials said 
west germanys economics ministry said the cocom decisions 
amounted to freeing all essential technologies for east germany 
what we are doing is rewriting the cocom controls from 
scratch said wendt who headed the us delegation its a 
tabla rasa approach 
the moves effectively modernize cocom which sets and oversees 
export restrictions on western technology with possible military 
application they also give a boost to the effort by east european 
nations to modernize their economies 
the decisions basically allow eastern europe to engage in 
modernization across the board said dennis kloske undersecretary 
of commerce for export administration and a member of the us 
delegation 
machine tools telecommunications and computer equipment which 
account for the bulk of cocom cases are the bricks and mortars 
of modern economic society kloske said 
the move to free access to a higher level of telecommunications 
equipment came at the initiative of the united states us 
officials said 
members of the us delegation estimated that in reducing cocoms 
list of controlled items about 45 billion of us exports alone 
were eliminated from the licensing process 
among the safeguards required for nations like poland hungary or 
czechoslovakia are guarantees the technology will be limited to 
civilian use and that there will be no intelligence cooperation with 
the soviet union aimed at diverting the technology in question 
wendt said 
kloske said the moves amounted to a basic removal of 50 percent 
of our licensing caseload 
president bush called may 2 for modernization of cocom following 
the dramatic moves toward democratization in eastern europe 
all cocom members the nato alliance minus iceland plus 
australia and japan were pressing for decontrols

here are excerpts from 
president fw de klerks speech thursday to parliament in which he 
announced the lifting of the state of emergency in three of the 
countrys four provinces 
there are today few or no restrictions on political activities in 
our country many organizations including the anc have now been 
stripped of the mythological status which they previously enjoyed 
they now have to defend their policies in the open marketplace of 
ideas 
i announced in april a number of practical steps which the 
government would take to strengthen the maintenance of law and 
order particularly in natal those steps are generally speaking 
indicating positive results 
i have decided to announce that there will no longer be a general 
countrywide state of emergency but that henceforth it will exist in 
natal only the increasing phenomenon in natal of violence among 
blacks which has led to the destruction of human life and property 
and has assumed shocking proportions as well as the exceptionally 
high level of intimidation that exists there must still be 
countered by the strongest means available 
the governments decision to lift the emergency has nothing to 
do with pressure from any quarter or with any wish to gain political 
capital we do not and have never regarded the state of emergency 
as a political pawn nonetheless the net result of the lifting of 
the state of emergency is that one of the main stumbling blocks has 
been removed 
the government is already looking at aspects of security 
legislation which could possibly inhibit the free conduct of 
peaceful politics and which because of the reduction in the violent 
onslaught on the existing order might no longer be necessary 
communication lines between the south african police and anc 
leaders have in the meantime also been established so that violence 
and intimidation could be monitored and countered right down to 
local level 
we are not only talking we are actually implementing in rapid 
succession the steps we have envisaged the process of building a 
new south africa has become irreversible we are on the threshhold 
of the real negotiation process and the time has come for other 
important role players to do their bit in particular the anc must 
now stop vacillating 
how can anc calls for peace be reconciled with mr nelson 
mandelas statement june 2 that the only sort of violence which we 
accept is organized violence in the form of armed activity which is 
properly controlled and where the target is carefully selected 
exactly what targets has the anc in mind the same police force 
which protected him and his colleagues during their recent visit to 
cape town the departments of the ministers with whom he and his 
colleagues were discussing in the need for peaceful solutions their 
political opponents in the homelands 
let bygones be bygones let us forget real or imagined injustices 
of the past and create a new future for our children free from 
mistrust prejudice and hatred and domination

federal investigators who found 15000 
violations of child labor laws during a threeday nationwide sweep 
in march followed with a surprise oneday effort this week the 
labor department said thursday 
the nearly 1000 enforcement officials who fanned out across the 
country wednesday did not immediately report the number of 
violations they uncovered at nearly 1900 businesses the department 
said 
during the march sweep agents visited mostly fastfood 
restaurants grocery stores and other service businesses that employ 
large numbers of youngsters 
this weeks effort was broadened to include agriculture workers 
and the garment industry officials said 
were trying to see if the problem is pervasive or if it is 
just in the metropolitan areas said johanna schneider a labor 
department spokesman 
the majority of the alleged violations uncovered in march 
involved firms in which 14 and 15yearolds worked more hours or 
later at night during the school week than allowed under federal law 
but there were also hundreds of youngsters mostly 16 and 
17yearolds who were performing dangerous tasks or using hazardous 
equipment such as powerdriven meatslicing machinery dough mixers 
and paperbalers 
of the 3900 businesses visited in march nearly half were in 
apparent violation of child labor laws officials said 
after the march blitz investigators first reported 7000 
violations but the total rose to 15500 after further reviews of 
payroll records the labor department said 
fines stemming from the march sweep are expected to total 5 
million up from the original estimate of 18 million in fines the 
agency said 
last year the labor departments wage and hour division which 
enforces child labor provisions of the fair labor standards act 
found 22508 minors to be illegally employed an alltime high 
fines totaling 27 million were assessed during all of 1989 
on friday a house panel will continue hearings into child labor 
violations those scheduled to testify include parents of youngsters 
killed on the job officials from burger king mcdonalds and 
dominos pizza are also scheduled to appear 
federal law forbids 14 and 15yearolds from working more than 
three hours on a school day or 18 hours in a week during the school 
year eight hours is permitted on weekend days and 40hour weeks are 
permitted in summer and during vacations 
youngsters under 14 are prohibited from working in all but a few 
exempt jobs such as newspaper delivery workers

americans took out just 584 million more in 
consumer credit than they paid off in april a sharp slowdown 
resulting from slackened demand for new automobiles the government 
said thursday 
the federal reserve said consumer credit increased at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 10 percent down from a 40 
percent growth rate the previous month 
consumers who account for about twothirds of all economic 
activity have been selective in their buying recently as the 
economy slowed because of the feds tightcredit policy designed to 
stem inflation 
spending on services generally continues to be brisk but 
expenditures for bigticket goods that are purchased with loans have 
flagged 
gilbert benz an economist with the swiss bank corp in new york 
said consumers are becoming less interested in taking on new debt 
both because of the amount they already hold and because of high 
interest rates 
in a possible reflection of future spending the conference board 
reported on monday that its index of consumer confidence dropped to 
1067 in may from 1073 in april 
some analysts question whether the fed report accurately reflects 
the amount of consumer debt since people have other ways of 
borrowing such as home equity loans that are not included in the 
survey 
automobile loans in april fell 25 billion a 103 percent 
annual rate of decline after gaining 75 percent in march 
automakers had reported a sharp drop in sales in april a trend 
that began in the final quarter of last year and continued in may 
credit card debt increased by a brisk 24 billion an annual 
rate of 140 percent after rising 102 percent the previous month 
but benz said much of the gain was due to easter sales and does 
not represent a trend 
youll probably see it pull back down the road he said 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose 735 
million a 43 percent annual rate after falling 69 percent in 
march 
borrowing for mobile homes was off 8 million a 04 percent 
annual rate of decline after gaining 41 percent a month earlier 
this supports what we were looking for in terms of the 
construction sector that there is a lot of weakness not only in the 
commercial but in the residential sector as well benz said 
manufacturing and housing have been the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit by the feds tightmoney policy 
the various changes left total consumer debt at the end of april 
at 7209 billion

a senate panel voted thursday to slash an 
administration request for additional money to tear down and rebuild 
the new us embassy in moscow which is riddled with electronic 
listening devices 
the senate foreign relations committee voted 150 for an 
amendment offered by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to cut 
the 270 million figure the state department had asked for the 
coming year to 50 million 
the vote was largely symbolic because it came on legislation that 
is unlikely to be enacted into law 
however it illustrated the continuing controversy over what to 
do with the eightstory structure suffused with soviet listening 
technology on which the government already has spent 60 million 
both democrats and republicans on the panel arguing in support 
of moynihans move said it would be a waste to tear down an nearly 
completed building that could be used for other purposes for which 
soviet eavesdropping would not be a problem 
moynihan argued that the 50 million he left in the bill would be 
enough to complete the compromised chancery building and construct a 
smaller building elsewhere in the embassy compound to house 
sensitive intelligence and other secret operations 
that idea is vigorously opposed by the state department which 
wants to tear the chancery down to its foundation and rebuild it for 
its originally planned use as the primary office building for the 
complex 
intelligence experts including the senate intelligence 
committee have endorsed that approach as the only secure one 
the house foreign affairs committee in a separate version of the 
legislation has included the full 270 million but left open the 
question of whether it would be spent on a new building or 
reconstructing the present one 
the skirmish over the embassy building came on a measure sought 
by the administration that also would authorize spending 474 
million to pay pastdue dues to the united nations 
sen jesse helms rnc signaled that if the measure comes to 
the senate floor he would seek to delete that money from the bill 
in addition the measure included a series of addons most from 
democrats to address pet concerns the provisions included 74 
million sought by moynihan to control sea lampreys and zebra mussels 
in the great lakes

leaders of a house committee introduced a 
bipartisan bill thursday to pay for improvements in the nations air 
travel system without tax increases or fees proposed by the bush 
administration 
the plan by the democratic and republican leadership of the house 
public works and transportation committee calls for spending 177 
billion over the next two fiscal years which is close to what 
president bush has requested 
but a large share of the money would come from the aviation trust 
fund which has accumulated 76 billion from passenger fees and 
other tax revenue bush wants new airport passenger fees and 
increased federal ticket taxes and taxes on aviation fuel 
the house aviation subcommittee is scheduled to take up the bill 
june 14 
we are proposing to authorize this funding that will benefit 
all airline passengers without a federal tax increase said rep 
glenn m anderson dcalif committee chairman 
other bill sponsors include the committees ranking republican 
rep paul hammerschmidt of arkansas along with the chairman and 
ranking minority member of the aviation subcommittee reps james l 
oberstar dminn and william f clinger jr rpa 
oberstar said the measure would reduce money in the trust fund to 
12 billion by fiscal 1995 
we see no ned for a federal tax increase for aviation while we 
have a 76 billion surplus in the trust fund oberstar said 
he said the committees plan envisions expansion of the nations 
aviation capacity through airport development modernization of 
the air traffic control system and improved system operations 
the bill would authorize 18 billion in fiscal 1991 and 19 
billion in fiscal 1992 for the airport improvement program and 25 
billion in 1991 and 3 billion in 1992 for aviation facilities and 
equipment it also would authorize 41 billion for operation in 
1991 about half of which would come from the trust fund in fiscal 
1992 that would increase to 44 billion 
the bill would eliminate penalty clauses applying to the trust 
fund that are designed to ensure that the greater share of the fund 
be spent for capital improvements rather than operation of the 
federal aviation administration the clauses limit the proportion of 
funding that can go to operations

a group of us healthcare companies have 
joined soviet officials to create a program that will share 
technology and research to improve care for children in both 
countries 
officials of childrens health system inc based in norfolk 
va said thursday the agreement with the soviet ministry of health 
would help meet that countrys needs for medical supplies drugs 
technology and advanced training 
the agreement was signed last month in moscow where two eastern 
virginia medical school pediatricians who represented childrens 
health system toured moscows leading pediatric hospitals 
drs raymond d adelman and rebecca l byrd said the soviet 
facilities were 10 to 15 years out of date and in urgent need of 
medical supplies equipment and drugs 
us physicians adelman said will benefit by learning about 
some of the new techniques and procedures the soviets have perfected 
about 90 percent of the patients in soviet pediatric hospitals 
would be treated as outpatients in the us health care system 
however because of a shortage of medical specialists and 
services in many areas of the soviet union children must travel 
hundreds of miles for appropriate care 
one public health problem facing the soviets is that many 
families refuse to have their children immunized because of the 
possibility they will contract aids byrd said 
unlike the united states where disposable syringes are used 
soviet physicians use reusable syringes which if not sterilized can 
transmit bloodborne diseases she said 
the exchange to be funded with donations from corporations and

a former playboy model was convicted thursday of 
failing to pay taxes on almost 400000 she got from an elderly 
millionaire who allegedly paid her and her twin sister for 
companionship or sex 
the jury deliberated about 3 hours before finding leigh ann 
conley 35 guilty on four misdemeanor counts of failing to file 
federal income tax returns on about 398000 
the conviction came a month after her twin lynnette harris was 
found guilty of evading taxes on 686000 she received from the same 
suburban milwaukee businessman the late david kritzik of shorewood 
the identical blonde twins appeared nude in playboy magazine and 
in two films i the jury and sorceress before joining 
three other young women in befriending kritzik who died last summer 
at age 89 
in ms harris trial the government alleged the money she 
received from kritzik was in exchange for sex in ms conleys case 
prosecutors charged she accepted the money in exchange for her 
companionship rather than for sex 
ms conley who could be sentenced to four years in prison and 
fined 325000 said she believed the jury in her trial was 
totally biased because of my sisters case i couldnt get a fair 
trial 
defense attorney aaron starobin said thursdays verdict would be 
appealed my feeling is the hype this case received made it very 
difficult for the jury to separate the law and facts from the 
emotion starobin said 
assistant us attorney mel johnson the prosecutor in both 
cases said he was satisfied with the verdicts 
us district judge thomas curran scheduled sentencing for ms 
conley for aug 29 
ms harris who is to be sentenced july 25 could receive a 
maximum of 12 years in prison and fines totaling 625000 the 
guilty verdict in her case also will be appealed her lawyer said 
in closing arguments johnson described kritzik as a millionaire 
who craved the company of young women and was willing to pay for 
it he wanted a relationship with ms conley he paid for it and he 
got it 
there isnt one single witness the government brought that said 
they could show there was a service contract starobin said 
there was a good relationship a happy relationship for both of 
them he wanted her to be happy and he had the ability 
he argued the money was given as a gift and did not constitute 
income the prosecution countered that kritzik never designated the 
money as a gift on his tax forms 
kritzik founded general merchandise co in the 1930s the company 
grew to become one of the largest mail order companies in the world 
he sold the company to jc penny co in 1962 for 11 million

veterans are waiting months for wheelchairs 
artificial limbs or even eyeglasses because veterans hospitals must 
borrow money from medical device accounts to meet other costs 
according to congressional testimony thursday 
the diversion is necessary because of chronic funding shortages 
in va hospitals witnesses told the senate veterans affairs 
committee 
the committee has been examining the veterans affairs 
departments prosthetics and rehabilitation programs for months 
conducting its own investigation 
prosthetics is the term for a wide range of medical devices 
including artificial limbs wheelchairs bathtub grab bars canes 
for the blind glasses and hearing aids and such basic items as 
stump socks 
close to 1 million of the nations 28 million veterans receive 
prosthetic devices from the va at a cost of 100 million each year 
veterans receive them because of injuries received during military 
service poor veterans may receive them even though the disability 
wasnt acquired as a result of service 
according to thursdays testimony management of the program is 
fragmented one of the problems is that the directors of the vas 
172 medical centers control local spending 
witnesses inside and outside of the va pointed to a lack of 
centralized funding a lack of cost accounting overpayments of up 
to 1000 for local purchases and a lack of inventory control at 
local hospitals as well as the vas central supply depot in denver 
local medical directors are trying to make everything happen 
with limited funds forcing them to juggle accounts said frederick 
downs jr vas director of prosthetics and sensory aids services 
local veterans tend not to complain too loudly for fear of 
getting even less service so they resort to making small purchases 
on their own he said they just want to get by 
but veterans groups said there are real problems 
the blind rehabilitation center at westhaven conn has more 
than 200 veterans on its waiting list 
the minneapolis medical center has only 36000 in its 
prosthetics account for the rest of the fiscal year because 276000 
was diverted for operating shortfalls 
veterans are waiting up to three months for hearing aids and 
wheelchairs 60 days for a simple pair of eyeglasses the american 
legion says 
the vas inspector general renald p morani said the district 
of columbia medical center spent 2300 for a brace that could have 
been obtained for less than 1400 
moranis office has conducted numerous audits of the prosthetics 
programs and is currently undertaking a new one deputy va secretary 
anthony j principi acknowledged problems and said the va would 
undertake immediate steps to correct problems outlined by a 
management task force he also plans to form an advisory committee

a father accused of sexual abuse in one of 
the nations longest and most highly publicized child custody 
battles said thursday he should have backed away from the bitter 
fight years ago 
i would frankly like nothing more than to deescalate the 
fight eric foretich said in an interview on radio station wfir 
foretich speaking from his office in falls church va said he 
opposes his former wife elizabeth morgans attempt to gain custody 
of their daughter but has filed no formal custody request for the 
girl himself 
ms morgan spent more than two years in prison in washington 
rather than surrender their daughter hilary for courtordered 
visits with foretich 
ms morgan accused foretich of sexually abusing the girl 
foretich denies the charge in the custody battle that began when the 
girl now 7 was a toddler 
sexual abuse has become the nuclear bomb in child custody 
cases foretich said in the radio interview when allegations 
are made against a man some fathers will back away and give up just 
because the allegation is enough to taint their life and livlihood 
i wish i had backed away a long time ago because it has not 
really helped my practice or my daughter either said foretich 
who is an oral surgeon 
hilary lives in new zealand with her maternal grandparents ms 
morgan has filed for permanent residency and custody there 
i am not going to subject my daughter to another media 
goaround to litigation in new zealand that would be purposeless 
foretich said 
foretich has said he would continue to fight his wifes custody 
petition in the new zealand courts because it would deny him access 
to the girl 
i would like nothing more than for her to have the chance to be 
a child again if that means i see less of her i can accept that 
very painful decision on my part foretich said i just dont 
see how its in her interests to have her whole life encumbered by 
this

romania must spend more than 25 
million for emergency repairs from last weeks earthquake that 
killed 14 people and injured about 1000 across central and eastern 
europe an official said thursday 
the government also appealed for foreign help in making this 
earthquakeprone country better equipped to handle temblors 
mihai grigoriu a top official in the economy ministry said last 
weeks quake carved a trail of damage through 14 of romanias 40 
counties including the capital city of bucharest 
grigoriu said experts started examining the damaged buildings in 
romania and noticed most older structures that were damaged in major 
quakes in 1977 and 1986 were also battered by the latest temblor 
the earthquake and its aftershocks may 3031 did major damage at 
400 schools 200 hospitals as well as many city halls in bucharest 
and other communities across this balkan nation of 23 million 
people grigoriu said 
the uppsala seismological center in sweden said the quake was 
centered about 63 miles under the earth causing tremors to be felt 
in bulgaria soviet moldavia yugoslavia and turkey it registered 
up to 68 on the richter scale 
apart from damage to buildings romanias 25 million loss also 
includes export goods such as tons of wood glass and tiles 
grigoriu told the associated press 
we could have well exported these materials to the west or to 
asia for hard currency he said 
officials have given no estimate for costs other than urgently 
needed repairs 
although no buildings collapsed chunks of concrete fell from 
highrise buildings on virtually every street in the capital 
in the city above the earthquakes epicenter focsani about 190 
miles northeast of bucharest 500 apartments were damaged and 
people were evacuated from four blocks of apartment buildings 
grigoriu said 
eugen ionescu a spokesman for the ministry of foreign affairs 
told a news conference thursday the romanian government would accept 
offers from other governments or international groups on improving 
its ability to handle earthquakes 
romania has a long history of damaging earthquakes with three or 
four major quakes a century according to official statistics more 
than 1500 romanians died in the 1977 quake 
the government has asked local groups in romania to make up a 
list of preworld war ii buildings at high risk of collapsing in the 
next major quake 
officials will then decide on the demolition of those buildings 
that are not worth any more money invested or are not worth being 
repaired grigoriu said

conagra inc has agreed to buy beatrice co 
for 134 billion in cash and stock the two food giants announced 
thursday 
the deal completes the breakup and sale of beatrice owner of 
such brand names as hunts wesson and and reddiwip by the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
kohlberg kravis bought beatrice then a major part of a huge 
foods and consumer products conglomerate in 1986 for 61 billion 
in what was then the biggest leveraged buyout ever the term 
leveraged buyout refers to purchasing a company with borrowed cash 
corporations bought in this way often are broken up and sold to 
repay the loan and make a profit 
since the buyout beatrice has sold off most of its businesses 
but still retains such wellknown food brands as hunts wesson 
manwich peter pan snack pak swiss miss la choy swift premium 
butterball eckrich and reddiwip 
conagra an omahabased diversified food company with annual 
sales of more than 15 billion sells fozen foods with such labels 
as healthy choice banquet morton and chun king as well as armour 
processed meats and country pride chicken products conagra also 
sells fertilizer animal feed and farm chemicals 
conagra last year lost a bidding war for poultry processor holly 
farms corp to tyson foods inc 
the beatrice sale will be completed after federal government 
review 
the deal calls for conagra to buy beatrice for 1150 per share 
from kohlberg kravis partnerships and management investors beatrice 
would have 12344 million shares outstanding assuming all 
outstanding warrants for purchase of beatrice shares are exercised 
the transaction would include approximately 626 million in cash 
and 710 million in conagra stock 
henry kravis a founding partner of kohlberg kravis said four 
years ago together with new management of beatrice we began the 
process of reshaping beatrice from a diverse conglomerate into a 
focused and more profitable food company todays announcement 
marks the successful completion of this process 
beatrice formerly was one of the nations biggest food and 
consumer products conglomerates owning product lines that included 
cocacola bottlers huntwesson foods swifteckrich meats stiffel 
lamps samsonite luggage tropicana juices max factor cosmetics and 
the avis car rental agency 
after the buyout beatrice began selling most of its businesses

investors who put up money for the deal 
for example avis was sold to a group led by its employees 
tropicana to seagram co ltd beatrices international food 
businesses to the investment firm tlc international and a score of

it would be fundamentally unjust to 
imprison john m poindexter for lying about the irancontra affair 
the former national security advisers lawyer argued in court papers 
filed thursday 
defense attorney richard beckler responding to a prosecution 
request that poindexter receive a prison term urged us district 
judge harold h greene to consider poindexters lengthy service as a 
navy officer and the suffering he has endured since the 
irancontra affair became public 3 years ago 
poindexter 53 a retired navy rear admiral is scheduled to be 
sentenced monday on five felony convictions of conspiracy making 
false statements to congress and obstructing congressional inquiries 
into the irancontra affair 
he was found guilty of lying to congress by denying the existence 
of a covert operation to arm the nicaraguan contras and to conceal 
us involvement in an israeli shipment of hawk missiles to iran in 
1985 
poindexter who served as president reagans national security 
adviser from late 1985 until revelations about the irancontra 
affair forced his resignation in november 1986 faces up to 25 years 
in prison and as much as 125 million in fines 
independent counsel lawrence e walshs request for imprisonment 
was made without the slightest reference to john poindexters 
lifelong career of service to his country and to his community 
said the sentencing memo bearing becklers signature 
it is made without consideration of the heavy punishment that 
the more than threeyear irancontra investigation has already 
visited upon john poindexter and his family beckler said 
irancontra prosecutors earlier this week told greene that the 
sentence must include a period of incarceration because the 
diet of lies poindexter fed congress did violence to this 
nations fundamental principles of government 
prosecutors said imprisoning poindexter would warn other 
highranking public officials that criminal violations of the public 
trust will result in more than mere loss of public employment 
but beckler said the prosecution well knows that john 
poindexter has suffered far more than mere loss of public 
employment 
he has lost a bright and promising career in the united states 
navy he has endured the public ridicule of the congress and the 
media and he has suffered financial hardship 
most painful of all he has been convicted beckler said 
the sentencing memo quoted from letters to the court attesting to 
poindexters moral character from admiral james l holloway iii 
former chief of naval operations as well as ronald h haines 
acting episcopal bishop of washington

gov rudy perpich had only two days to 
savor the euphoria of mikhail s gorbachevs visit 
now hes facing accusations from the bush administration of 
behaving very badly because the states two republican senators 
were barred from a luncheon for the soviet president on top of 
that hes grappling with questions about sexual harassment lawsuits 
against his former chief of staff 
perpich faces a tough endorsement fight at the state 
democraticfarmerlabor party convention on saturday but his 
campaign is predicting victory over his challenger former commerce 
commissioner mike hatch 
the gorbachev visit went well and the governor did a nice job 
and thats what people are going to remember campaign chairman 
john stanoch said thursday 
a 60 percent majority is required for endorsement and its 
widely expected that several ballots will be needed to determine a 
winner 
perpich whos seeking an unprecedented fourth term and hatch 
say they will run in the sept 11 primary regardless of whos 
endorsed 
perpich moved quickly to make the most of gorbachevs sunday 
visit which the governor said provided the greatest day of his 
political career film of the visit will be used in campaign 
commercials stanoch said monday 
but midweek perpich was confronted with the news that one of 
his former secretaries and another woman had filed lawsuits alleging 
sexual harassment by terry montgomery perpichs former righthand 
man 
the suits filed in hennepin county district court say karen 
ehrisman and gayle treloar left their jobs at the statefunded 
greater minnesota corp a rural development agency because of the 
alleged sexual harassment 
ehrisman a secretary to perpich for nearly five years alleges 
harassment by montgomery at the agency and while she was the 
governors secretary 
montgomery was perpichs chief of staff in 1977 and 1978 and from 
1983 through august 1987 when he became head of the rural 
development agency he resigned as agency president in december 
after a 22yearold woman seeking an internship accused him of 
making sexual advances those charges were dropped in march after 
the agency paid the woman 130000 
the bush administrations complaint that sens rudy boschwitz and 
dave durenberger were left out of the gorbachev luncheon was raised 
wednesday by white house protocol chief joseph reed 
it was my understanding with governor perpich that they were to 
be invited as far as im concerned he reneged on that 
understanding reed told reporters at he white house 
perpich said he had never agreed to invite the senators and 
complained the gorbachev visit was now being marred by petty 
politics 
the governor accused boschwitz of working to sabotage the visit 
an allegation the senator denied 
stanoch said wednesdays developments are no concern heading into 
the party convention 
i think that any delegate who is concerned about either issue 
is going to have an opportunity to discuss it with the governor 
he said thursday 
still hatch pointed to the sexual harassment lawsuit as a 
potential issue 
these are very serious charges and fairness dictates that the 
courts determine if they are justified he said however 
clearly if they are justified the governor has a tremendous 
accountability problem 
despite this weeks ups and downs hatch expressed concern about 
the lingering effects of gorbachevs visit 
theres no doubt about it this gorbachev visit threw a hand 
grenade into events hatch said we dont know what the outcome 
of that will be we do know that up until two three weeks ago 
we were substantially ahead 
no new campaign ads appeared this week and both campaigns said 
they were devoting their attention in the last days before the 
convention to working with delegates individually 
hatch 42 was appointed state commerce commissioner in 1983 by 
perpich after a twoyear stint as party chairman he has maintained 
close relations with party regulars while perpich 61 regularly 
ignores party affairs 
hatch said he has 53 percent of the committed delegates but 110 
uncommitted delegates hold the key there are 1383 delegates who 
will cast 1261 votes because some delegates have a halfvote and 
some a twothirds vote

us officials and political activists praised 
the end of the state of emergency in south africa on thursday but 
said the action doesnt warrant the removal of us sanctions 
the white house said the move by south african president fw de 
klerk was a sign of the remarkable progress made by the 
whiteminority government 
de klerk ended a 4yearold national state of emergency in all 
but the nations natal province the policy imposed some of the 
governments harshest political restrictions on the countrys 
blackmajority population 
this is another significant step toward creating a climate 
conducive to negotiations that will lead to a democratic nonracial 
south africa said deputy white house press secretary alixe glen 
it is a long overdue and important step which will help pave 
the way to end the brutal system of apartheid said sen edward 
kennedy dmass the prime sponsor of the 1986 antiapartheid act 
the legislation barred landing rights in the united states to 
south african airways banned us import of south african uranium 
and coal and prohibited new us investments and bank loans in the 
racially segregated country 
apartheid is still in place kennedy said adding this is 
no time for the united states or any other nation to lift any 
sanctions 
its an important step forward but it clearly does not meet the 
requirements of the lifting of sanctions echoed rep ronald 
dellums dcalif chairman of the congressional black caucus 
at the state department deputy spokesman richard boucher noted 
that the bush administration cannot legally modify us sanctions 
against south africa until certain conditions are met 
the law says the restrictions would be lifted automatically if 
president bush reported to congress that the south african 
government satisfied specific conditions for ending them 
the law requires the south african government to repeal the state 
of emergency nationwide and free black nationalist leader nelson 
mandela as it did last february additionally the government must 
release all other political prisoners legalize opposition political 
parties and their activities and enter into goodfaith negotiation 
with representative black leaders without preconditions 
the south african government also must repeal the group areas act 
and the population registration act which restrict the movement and 
residence of nonwhites to comply us preconditions 
randall robinson executive director of transafrica a group that 
lobbies on concerns of africa and the caribbean commended the 
action but called it a tiny measure 
it is a little late and all too small considering the distance 
that must be traveled in a very short space of time he added 
robinson said the move was conspicuously timed to coincide with a 
13nation trip by mandela that will include a meeting with bush in 
washington on june 25 and designed to purchase relief from the 
painful western sanctions 
de klerk also is expected meet with bush at a later date that has 
not yet been set

people thronged along one mile of lenin boulevard where four stages 
were set up for speakers singers and other performers the crowd 
also spilled into many side streets in a sea of swaying blue 
opposition pennants and banners

the udf must win otherwise there will be no real life because 
otherwise we would find ourselves even deeper in the morass said 
nina galobova a student in her early 20s using the initials of the 
opposition alliance 
what we are still lacking is democracy and a system that will 
show to the world that we are worthy of its respect udf chairman

join europe and the world or will remain stifled in its own narrow

members after new people were admitted the last few weeks 
the elections will confirm the party as the most influential 
political force in the country he declared

had tried to negate everything that has been created in the last 
45 years under communism 
at a latenight news conference lukanov said that even if his 
party wins more than 50 percent of sundays vote i refuse to head 
a oneparty government 
socialist officials have said a coalition government is needed to

sen daniel patrick moynihan dny tried to 
sell his plan to cut social security taxes to highlevel budget 
negotiators thursday but got a mixed reaction participants said 
moynihan visited the sixth session of private budget talks 
between bush administration officials and congressional leaders the 
bargainers spent most of the day discussing the possibility of 
cutting federal benefit programs in order to reduce the budget 
deficit with their discussions focusing on technical issues no 
offers were exchanged 
moynihan has proposed rolling back the 765 percent levy workers 
pay to the retirement system he argues that social security builds 
a surplus of tens of billions of dollars every year money that is 
used to shrink the apparent size of the deficit 
the plan has attracted the attention of taxconscious 
politicians some democrats say it would be wise for the party to 
support a tax cut while others joined by republicans say it would 
drive the governments red ink even deeper 
sen pete domenici of new mexico the ranking republican on the 
senate budget committee said there was not as much positive 
support for moynihans plan among negotiators as he had thought 
there might be he predicted the plan has little chance of 
passing congress 
but senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said 
he believed the proposal could be approved by lawmakers 
we have to factor that in the moynihan proposal could be a 
reality sasser said 
participants said that the negotiators expressed little 
enthusiasm for cutting benefit programs which include social 
security medicare and payments to farmers 
white house budget director richard darman said that the chairmen 
of congressional committees who oversee those programs attended 
thursdays session and opposed spending cuts 
if we were to come to a consensus around what they were 
suggesting wed be moving in the wrong direction darman said

three democratic members of the senate banking 
committee introduced legislation thursday that would create a 
justice department strike force to attack fraud at savings and loans 
and other financial institutions 
the bill written by sens alan dixon of illinois tim wirth of 
colorado and bob graham of florida would establish a financial 
services crime division headed by an assistant attorney general 
as part of sampl legislation enacted in august the bush 
administration earmarked an additional 50 million to pursue sampl 
fraud its hiring 368 new employees including 202 fbi agents and 
120 prosecutors to staff teams in 27 cities 
doug tillett a spokesman for the justice department said the 
strike force proposal on the face of it appears to be a 
duplication of effort 
however democrats point to a backlog of 2300 uninvestigated 
cases of suspected fraud each involving a loss of more than 
100000 as evidence the administration needs to intensify its 
effort 
these numbers are astounding and cannot be ignored wirth said 
democrats also fault the administration for not seeking the full 
75 million in antifraud money authorized by the sampl bill 
this country is being robbed blind and the thieves are getting 
away scotfree dixon said 
tillett said in the past two years justice has obtained 51 
convictions of sampl executives from its dallas office adding i 
think its wrong to suggest the department is doing nothing were 
working very hard 
he said the department would not shy from asking congress for 
more money if needed 
on april 30 the senate by a 5048 vote rejected a proposal to 
divert 30 million from promoting tourism in panama to fighting sampl 
fraud 
cosponsors of the strike force bill all democrats are sens 
paul simon of illinois richard bryan of nevada john kerry of 
massachusetts bob kerrey of nebraska and claiborne pell of rhode

an alzheimers disease diagnosis is absolute only 
after an autopsy experts said thursday in the wake of the 
doctorassisted suicide of a woman who had been told she had the 
incurable illness 
the difficulty in some cases is that it may be misdiagnosed 
said michelle manning deputy director of the alzheimers 
associations detroitarea chapter 
as many as 80 diseases can appear to be alzheimers which 
affects up to 4 million people most of them elderly manning said 
alzheimers is a degenerative brain and nerve disorder that robs 
people of their memories abilities to function and eventually their 
lives 
a new spotlight has focused on alzheimers since monday when dr 
jack kevorkian of suburban royal oak hooked janet adkins 54 to a 
machine and watched her die as she pressed a button that pumped 
heartstopping chemicals into her system 
kevorkian had driven with mrs adkins of portland ore to a 
park outside detroit and attached her to the electricpowered device 
in the back of his van kevorkian said she was dead within minutes 
after she pressed the button 
mrs adkins who had despaired after being told a year ago she 
had alzheimers had read of kevorkians device and thought that 
sounded like a very very humane and painless way to end her life 
said her husband ronald 
michigan state police seized kevorkians van and suicide device 
after he reported mrs adkins death monday prosecutors planned to 
seek an injunction to stop kevorkian from using the device again at 
a friday hearing in oakland county circuit court 
the medical examiners office refused to release results of mrs 
adkins autopsy thursday the prosecutors office did not return 
several calls ronald adkins said thursday that the autopsy which 
his wife had requested had not been completed 
medical experts said extensive tests must be conducted when a 
person is suspected of having alzheimers but the diagnosis isnt 
definite until brain tissue is examined under a microscope they 
said 
its always called probable alzheimers disease thats 
probable in capital letters said dr creighton phelps vice 
president of medical and scientific affairs for the chicagobased 
alzheimers association 
the criteria fordefinite diagnosis is after death he said 
a probable diagnosis is usually between 80 percent and 90 percent 
accurate he said a possible diagnosis is about 70 percent accurate 
tests include memory checks brain scans and spinal taps 
physicians also interview the patients family about changes in 
behavior phelps said 
symptoms include memory loss confusion difficulty in judgment 
changes in mood and personality and loss of bodily functions in the 
final stages a patient may be as helpless as a newborn unable to 
recognize relatives 
dr norman foster professor of neurology at the university of 
michigan base for the michigan alzheimers disease research center 
said it takes at least a week and often a month to check brain 
tissue under a microscope for the tangled clumps of cells common in 
alzheimers patients 
foster said physicians usually call on counselors in alzheimers 
cases 
the physicians are not really prepared to handle all the legal 
social and economic ramifications by this illness foster said 
alzheimers support groups were shaken at the news of kevorkians 
machine 
we have a number of services available that would hopefully 
prevent this kind of decision from taking place said manning of 
the support group here we would hope that they explore other 
avenues 
foster said people with alzheimers shouldnt feel so 
hopeless theres lots of things they can do we dont promise 
an instant cure but were attacking this disease 
advances in testing are encouraging said robert p lisak wayne 
state university neurology chairman and chief neurologist at detroit 
medical center and harper hospital 
the newest test measures a protein believed associated with 
alzheimers a study in wednesdays journal of the american medical 
association said the protein can be used as a model for a diagnostic 
test in spinal fluid 
breakthroughs dont come like a bolt out of the blue lisak 
said no one person is going to make a sudden discovery modern 
science builds on it 
at this point you want to make sure its not something 
treatable and then you can kind of say its probably alzheimers

a jury has absolved an army 
private in the killing of a tv journalist but colleagues of the 
slain soundman on thursday accused troops of pressuring frightened 
jurors to find the soldier innocent 
others called it another failure of the salvadoran judicial 
system to punish the military which has been blamed for thousands 
of summary executions kidnappings and torture of suspected 
government opponents the past decade 
president alfredo cristiani acknowledged thursday the presence of 
30 soldiers at the brief deliberations wednesday might have swayed 
the jury in what highranking military authorities had called an 
open and shut case against pvt jose orellana 
the members of orellanas unit the elite arce battalion entered 
the courthouse in the eastern provincial capital of san miguel as 
the jury began deliberating 
the fivemember jury then found orellana innocent of murdering 
channel 12 soundman mauricio pineda at a military roadblock during 
1989 elections 
marcos antonio guevara who covered the trial for channel 12 
said the jurors were afraid of the soldiers 
they were telling the jury in so many words that if they 
delivered a guilty verdict they would have to contend with the arce 
battalion he said the jurors live there they leave the court 
alone and have their skins to think about 
referring to the soldiers presence cristiani told a news 
confernce it could have had an effect certainly in many cases 
the reaching of a decision completely free from outside influence is 
difficult 
the prosecution said it would appeal 
channel 12 news director narciso castillo said the absence of the 
defendant at the trial and the intimidating presence of soldiers at 
the courthouse was grounds for overturning the verdict 
pineda was shot at a military roadblock march 19 1989 he was 
part of a crew in a pickup truck covering that days nationwide 
presidential and legislative elections 
two other journalists were killed and another was seriously 
wounded during the election weekend 
one died in a crossfire during combat between leftist rebels and 
government troops the other was killed by air force paratroopers at 
a roadblock near the capital his colleague was seriously wounded in 
the same incident the paratroopers have yet to go to trial 
el salvadors highest ranking military authorities admitted 
orellana fired on the channel 12 pickup without provocation or 
justification they said the case was the most openandshut of the 
slayings of the journalists during the elections 
raul beltran a salvadoran journalist next to pineda when he was 
shot said of the verdict this kind of justice is disappointing 
though the armed forces have been blamed for thousands of 
executions kidnappings and torture in the 10yearold civil war 
against leftist guerrillas no officer has been convicted or even 
tried for a crime of human rights abuse 
four officers including a colonel are among eight army men 
charged with murder in the nov 16 slaying of six jesuit priests 
their housekeeper and her daughter 
according to testimony from those charged the priests were 
killed by a unit of the elite ustrained atlacatl battalion 
atlacatls commander col oscar leon linares on wednesday bade 
farewell to his troops before leaving for a new post leon was 
promoted june 1 to military commander of morazan province 
according to testimony the jesuits widely respected academics 
were killed because many highranking army officers considered 
them guerrilla ideologues 
far from mentioning the jesuit massacre as a black mark on the 
atlacatl record and cautioning his troops against repetition of such 
action leon told them in his speech 
you must remember that in front of us we have a terrorist 
combatant but behind that combatant there are intelligent 
sectors that use any kind of calumny and other tricks to gain 
ground

army chief humberto ortega on thursday 
presented president violeta barrios de chamorro with a plan to trim 
and reorganize nicaraguas armed forces the largest in central 
america 
mrs chamorros campaign pledge to cut the armed forces helped 
her defeat gen ortegas brother former president daniel ortega in 
an election feb 25 
although ortegas sandinista government never gave official 
figures on the size of the military it was acknowledged to be the 
largest in the region after mrs chamorro banned reserve duty and 
ended the draft about 50000 soldiers were left on active duty 
a oneparagraph army communique gave no details of the plan but 
government sources who demanded anonymity said it outlined the 
eventual reduction of 20000 soldiers from the armed forces 
presidential spokesman danilo lacayo said mrs chamorro had no 
comment on the proposal 
the army communique said gen ortega presented mrs chamorro with 
the document that contains the general plan of reduction and 
restructuring of the sandinista peoples army 
the communique said gen ortega has fulfilled her instructions 
of april 25 in her speech to the nation 
mrs chamorro said in the inaugural speech that she would order 
gen ortega to devise a plan to trim the fighting machine he had 
spent a decade building with soviet help she also announced she was 
taking over gen ortegas post as defense minister 
although the army still bears the name of the revolutionary party 
mrs chamorro ousted in the election a transition protocol with the 
sandinistas obliged the officer corps to give up party positions in 
return mrs chamorro promised to respect the integrity and 
professionalism of the army 
ortega gave up his post as one of the nine members of the 
sandinista national directorate which had run nicaragua since 1979 
but mrs chamorros decision to let him remain as armed forces 
commander drove a wedge between her and the 14party united national 
opposition coalition that helped bring her to power 
the united states backed mrs chamorro and the contra rebels that 
fought the sandinistas

the ignalnia nuclear power plant in 
northeastern lithuania was shut down by its automatic safety system 
for unknown reasons thursday the washington office of the 
lithuanian information center said 
the plant uses the same reactor design as used at chernobyl which 
exploded in the worlds worst nuclear accident four years ago 
the center quoting a statement issued by the lithuanian supreme 
council in vilnius said operations of the plant will be halted for 
at least two days while the reasons for the shutdown are 
investigated 
the information center said the incident throws a new burden on 
lithuanias energy production facilities already strained by a 
partial soviet fuel embargo 
the statement by the lithuanian supreme council said the ignalina 
plant lost power at 1052 am local time and added during the 
course of normal functioning of the second reactor for reasons 
unapparent for the time being the shutdown system of the reactor 
became activated 
now the entire workload of electrical energy must be transfered 
to the regional electrical plant which is almost completely depleted 
of emergency fuel resources the statement said 
the statement quoted lithuanian energy minister leonas asmantas 
as saying sabotage was not suspected 
the partial fuel embargo was imposed by the kremlin to pressure 
the lithuanian parliament to suspend its march 11 declaration of 
independence 
the lithuanian information center said that as of may 28 the 
embargo had caused a 25 percent reduction in electrical power 
production in the baltic republic 
the ignalia site has two 1500megawatt reactors and it was not 
clear from the statement if both were in operation when the plant 
was shut down 
the reactors are the graphitemoderated watercooled designed 
designated rbmk in the soviet union one of which ran out of 
control and exploded at chernobyl on april 26 1986 killing 31 
people and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people 
because of the dispersion of highly radioactive material over 
thousands of square miles 
the safety systems at chernobyl were disconnected at the time for 
unauthorized experiments

nato on thursday took a fresh look at 
its future in a europe of receding eastwest tensions and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher urged members to hold onto 
sufficient nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them 
yet mrs thatcher on her way to moscow to see president mikhail 
s gorbachev concluded europe faces a new situation created by 
soviet troop withdrawals and the prospect of a new agreement to 
reduce us and soviet conventional forces 
secretary of state james a baker iii reported he found the 
soviet attitude about enrolling a unified germany in the north 
atlantic treaty organization much more encouraging since 
gorbachev held summit talks in washington last week with president 
bush 
he told foreign ministers from 15 western nations that the shift 
was more of a change of spirit than anything soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze said to him specifically at their 
meeting tuesday night in copenhagen denmark 
baker made his comments during a private session they were 
disclosed by a senior official 
as the allies met leaders of the warsaw pact indicated they 
would reshape their own alliance from a military to a political body 
and declared the enemy image of the east and west a thing of the 
past 
in moscow the warsaw pact leaders announced their readiness 
for constructive cooperation with nato and said they favored the 
creation of a new alleuropean security system and the creation of 
a single europe of peace and cooperation without artificial 
barriers and ideological hostility 
despite earlier reports that hungary might want to pull out of 
the alliance deputy foreign minister yuli kvitsinsky of the soviet 
union said there wasnt a single statement made relating to a wish 
to quit the warsaw treaty organization 
no agreement was reported at the moscow session on western 
proposals for making a united germany part of nato 
the allies reaffirmed their commitment to nato membership for the 
unified germany and also to try to meet the legitimate needs of 
the soviet government so they dont feel isolated a senior us 
official said later wednesday 
the soviet union has to get over the idea of seeing nato as an 
enemy and see nato as a partner said the official who briefed 
american reporters under rules guaranteeing he would not be 
identified 
earlier a british official said his government had 
difficulties with the idea of exchanges with a faltering 
sovietled alliance it would be life after death for the warsaw 
pact he said 
the allies said the changes in europe required a strategic review 
of troop levels weaponry and the conditions for using them 
according to the us official 
a more upbeat account came from the italian foreign minister 
gianni de michelis 
he said baker and west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher who also met with shevardnadze in copenhagen told us 
they are optimistic that the role of a unified germany in nato will 
not be a problem in negotiations with the soviet union 
but he said moscow wanted to know what kind of nato will 
germany belong to 
the twoday meeting at a resort in turnberry on scotlands 
rugged west coast is the third in a series held this spring to try 
to map out a new strategy for nato the members meet in london next 
month to formally begin work on natos future 
mrs thatcher in her speech insisted on the allies keeping 
nuclear weapons 
we must retain sufficient nuclear weapons and the means of 
delivering them to meet our longterm security needs she said 
our job as ministers responsible for our countries defense and 
security is to take the long view 
however in an apparent ad lib at the end of her speech mrs 
thatcher assured moscow that nato did not threaten the soviet union 
nato has never attacked anyone she said 
baker told the allies in a statement made public later that 
we can and should be prepared to meet reasonable soviet concerns 
but baker said we cannot acquiesce in an effort to block a 
full return to german sovereignty or to use ostensible security 
concerns over germany as a surrogate for weakening the alliance 
baker told the allies that the defense of europe primarily will 
remain in natos hands 
nato will remain an important contributor to the legitimacy and 
stability of the new europe although its functions and capabilities 
will evolve with the new times of changing challenges he said 
the soviets have been resisting the us demand for nato 
membership for a unified germany suggesting instead their powerful 
neighbor be in the warsaw pact as well shevardnadze meanwhile 
proposed to baker that the two alliances adopt some measures to 
guard against a revival of german militarism 
baker offered the soviet official a ninepoint package of 
assurances including a promise that the merger of east germany with 
west germany would not lead to demands to recover territory lost at 
the end of world war ii 
he also assured shevardnadze that nato would revise its strategy 
to reflect the lessening of eastwest tensions and take on more of a 
political mission 
west germanys genscher said the soviets were interested in nato 
changing into more of a political structure and engaging the warsaw 
pact in confidencebuilding measures and cooperation west 
german sources said 
genscher informed the allies west germany may not hold elections 
scheduled for december a senior official of another nato delegation 
said unification is moving so quickly that combined elections may be 
held in east and west germany by midjanuary

an ethnic estonian considered a strong backer of 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms was elected the new 
patriarch of the russian orthodox church and its following of tens 
of millions on thursday 
metropolitan alexi of leningrad and novgorod won election in a 
secret ballot said anna generalova a church spokeswoman 
alexi 61 takes the helm of the church at a time when decades of 
soviet government repression are being lifted and interest in 
religion is growing 
a church council of 330 members chose him as successor to 
patriarch pimen who died may 3 at age 79 
he won despite predictions that many would consider him an 
inappropriate leader because he is of baltic rather than russian 
descent 
in his preelection program published by a church journal he 
backed traditional church positions and spoke out in support of 
gorbachevs reforms saying they could improve both the material and 
spiritual lives of believers 
he also pledged to work to solve ecological problems according 
to keston college a britishbased organization that closely follows 
events in the russian orthodox church 
alexi runs the prestigious leningrad diocese and has been 
responsible for the russian orthodox church in estonia as well he 
was one of several clergymen elected last year as a deputy to the 
soviet congress of peoples deputies 
the meeting of the local council which includes clergymen monks 
and some laymen was held at the trinityst sergius monastery in 
zagorsk northeast of moscow 
it was closed to the press but soviet tv showed scores of 
bearded bishops in their flattopped black or white mitres and 
flowing robes gathered at rows of flowerbedecked tables as the 
meeting began 
in choosing alexi the council passed over a top cleric in the 
forefront of a bitter dispute with ukrainian catholics and another 
candidate considered a probable compromise candidate 
he comes to power when russian orthodoxy is being virtually 
reborn in the soviet union 
so many churches have been returned to religious authorities to 
be restored and reopened that observers say the church is strapped 
for money 
a law guaranteeing freedom of conscience is slowly working its 
way throughout the soviet legislature raising hopes that decades of 
the officially atheist states repression of religion are coming to 
an end 
after the bolsheviks took power in 1917 they deprived the church 
of all legal rights and imprisoned or executed thousands of priests 
the church leadership decided to conform to the state and it 
survived despite savage persecution under stalin and suppression 
under subsequent governments 
the number of russian orthodox worshipers is estimated at 20 
million to 45 million

likud officials announced thursday they were 
close to forming a rightwing coalition government but conceded that 
a key ultraorthodox religious party was still holding out 
their statements came after a party official said caretaker prime 
minister yitzhak shamir had agreed to take tougher measures against 
the palestinian uprising in an effort to draw important farright 
factions into a coalition 
shamir who heads the rightist likud bloc also has promised his 
new coalition would allocate more money for enlarging the jewish 
settlements in the occupied lands the daily maariv reported the 
united states opposes new settlements saying they are an obstacle 
to peace 
ariel sharon chairman of the likud central committee said 
thursday that likud had succeeded in garnering a 62vote majority 
coalition in the 120member parliament he said he would convene the 
likuds governing committee on sunday to approve the new coalition 
shamir was expected to tell president chaim herzog on friday 
morning he succeeded in mustering enough seats for a majority 
coalition just hours before his deadline to form a government 
expires likud officials said 
however the officials conceded they had not received a final 
pledge of support from the shas party an ultraorthodox group 
david magen a likud minister told israel television they were 
waiting to receive a positive answer from shas but said he was 
optimistic it would agree to participate in the government 
in a related development protesters demanding electoral reform 
clashed with police outside the prime ministers office shouting 
they wanted an end to what they called political extortion no 
injured were reported 
feverish attempts to overcome feuds lasted into the night with 
likud offering more government jobs to ultraorthodox religious 
parties whose support is crucial for forming the cabinet 
labor party officials greeted the likelihood of a likudled 
coalition government with caution but one labor leader said such a 
rightwing government would reduce world support for the jewish 
state 
this will be a rightwing extremist government a tragic 
government for israel labor party chairman micha harish said on 
israel tv 
head of the government press and a member of likud yossi olmert 
told the associated press it is very very likely shamir will 
tell the president he has formed a government he added it was 
almost certain shas would join 
the shas party was instrumental in bringing down shamirs unity 
government on march 15 when it abstained from a laborled vote of 
no confidence over likuds refusal to agree to a usproposed 
meeting with palestinian representatives 
labor leader shimon peres then failed in a 35day bid to form a 
leftofcenter coalition on april 27 herzog gave shamir a mandate 
to try to form a government 
danny dayan secretarygeneral of the farright tehiya party 
said earlier thursday that shamir had agreed to hardline action 
against the 30monthold palestinian uprising to meet his deadline 
for shaping a government 
dayan reached by telephone said the policy guidelines will 
say that measures will be taken to end the intefadeh or uprising 
however he said the agreement did not detail what measures were 
involved 
untraright leaders have been demanding such steps as expelling 
arab stonethrowers from the occupied territories and destroying 
more homes of terror suspects 
across the street from the coalition dealings in shamirs office 
police used force to disperse about 200 protesters calling for an 
end to the use of political posts and public funds to lure defectors 
to cross party lines and woo religious factions no injuries or 
arrests were reported

block after devastated block of this farming 
town told thursday of the visit by a tornado but siren blasts gave 
the 1800 residents here precious minutes to take shelter and none 
was killed 
three guests at the lariat hotel piled into a bathtub and pulled 
a mattress over them when the tornado siren sounded at dusk 
wednesday 
we were doing a lot of praying in that bathtub said david 
thomas who shared the cramped quarters with arley boston and carl 
riley 
the tornado tore their room apart 
it felt like somebody just reached down and squeezed your whole 
body my eardrums were coming out thomas said 
town clerk teresa odwyer said she ran to town hall when the 
siren sounded and put the town records in the vault 
minutes later the tornado ripped the front off the building 
as residents began picking up the pieces thursday officials 
toured this town about 80 miles southeast of denver 
streets were cluttered with metal wood and other debris left by 
the tornado that hopscotched down main street shortly after 8 pm 
yanking down walls and roofs overturning rail cars and smashing a 
grain silo as if it were a soda can 
business owners stood guard against looters and dozens of police 
patrolled 
among the devastation people marveled that no one died 
were lucky to be alive said angie spencer cradling her cat 
in her arms as she surveyed what was left of her house 
we went underneath the house and under a crawlspace and it 
sounded like an earthquake we just heard everything rumbling and 
ripping and when we got out everything was gone 
gov roy romer estimated damage between 20 million and 40 
million he said about 90 percent of the businesses and government 
offices were damaged or destroyed and about half the towns 750 
homes 
romer said he would seek federal disaster aid for the town 
at least 12 people were injured but just two remained 
hospitalized thursday one in fair condition and one listed as 
stable 
lincoln county sheriff leroy yowell was driving down main street 
when he saw the tornado looming behind him 
it was huge he said we drove to the east edge of town and 
hid behind a building until it passed 
yowell and other residents alerted the colorado state patrol 
which sounded the civil defense siren giving people five to six 
minutes warning the tornado was headed their way 
the tornado moved through town from south to northeast in a wide 
s 
while some residents complained the siren was drowned out by 
hail many credited the warning system with saving lives 
some said they hadnt even needed it 
you could hear it coming and when the glass started tinkling 
we all ran for the basement i dont know why somebody didnt get 
killed said russ covington a lincoln county commissioner 
the tornado halted water electricity and telephones but crews 
restored at least limited supplies of all three services thursday 
relief efforts were launched by state and federal agencies a 
makeshift grocery store was set up in the high school 
len boulas an operations officer with the state division of 
emergency services said a final damage assessment would take two to 
three days 
the american red cross fed about 2000 storm victims volunteers 
and cleanup workers thursday and helped concerned relatives find 
loved ones

senate supporters of a wideranging crime bill 
with curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons scrambled to save the 
measure thursday after efforts to stop a filibuster fell short 
i think we can work it out sen strom thurmond rsc said 
after senators of both parties called for a compromise version shorn 
of a number of the troublesome provisions 
republicans were weighing a plan to retain the bills provisions 
to put curbs on nine semiautomatic assault weapons overhaul the 
criminal appeals system establish the death penalty for 30 federal 
offenses and finetune money laundering laws 
under the plan the bill would be stripped of provisions to allow 
courts to consider evidence gathered with flawed warrants and to set 
up an organized crime and drug division in the justice department 
after caucusing on the scheme which also would allow 12 
amendments on each side republican leaders walked down the hall 
and met with their democratic counterparts but emerged without any 
commitments the two sides did agree to explore the proposal next 
week 
democratic leaders blamed pressure from the national rifle 
association for the senates refusal to limit debate on the current 
version 
they first pronounced the bill dead after the senate voted 5737 
in favor of limiting debate three votes short of the number needed 
but then after an overture from thurmond they called for talks 
aimed at reaching such a compromise 
the only way were really likely to get a bill is if we can 
enter into negotiations said sen joseph r biden jr ddel 
much of the discussion of the bill has focused on its ban on the 
manufacture or importation of nine kinds of semiautomatic assault 
rifles but it contains other significant provisions as well 
the legislation contains remnants of president bushs crime 
program sent to capitol hill a year ago but has been largely 
rewritten since then and few of its provisions now find favor with 
the administration 
under various provisions 
the death penalty would be established for 30 specific federal 
crimes 
courts would be able to consider evidence gathered with flawed 
warrants in some case 
an end would be sought to long delays up to a decade in some 
cases in carrying out executions 
democratic leaders said they needed to limit debate because of 
300 pending amendments that could delay passage indefinitely the 
time limit sought by democratic leaders would have squeezed action 
on all amendments and the overall bill into 30 hours 
on the roll call 11 republicans joined 46 democrats in voting 
for a time limit seven democrats and 30 republicans opposed it 
that gave bill sponsors three more votes than they gained tuesday 
when they made their first run at a time limit but still not enough 
biden blamed the nra for the proliferation of amendments the 
nra says this bill they want to kill because it contains guns he 
declared 
indeed in the days before the vote the nra sent messages from 
executive director wayne lapierre to gun owners in eight states 
urging them to put pressure on their senators 
one mailed to south dakota ripped into sen tom daschle dsd 
saying the gun provisions had survived in an earlier skirmish by one 
vote 
tom daschle betrayed every honest gun owner in south dakota by 
voting for it because daschle bought the big antigun media lie 
that gun control equals crime control and has now joined ted 
kennedy and the national gun ban crowd 
it urged gun owners to call daschles offices in aberdeen rapid 
city and sioux falls and provided the phone numbers messages with 
the names of other senators and similar accusations were mailed into 
a number of other states 
daschle responded by telling south dakotans that as a hunter 
and a gun owner i am against gun control period 
lets be realistic he said taking a couple of very small 
steps to try to deal with the drug killers who use these assault 
weapons is not going to hurt a single law abiding south dakota 
sportsman 
also senate democratic leader george mitchell said he had 
received phone calls because of a letter sent to maine gun owners by 
the nra they have certainly been critical of me in the past he 
said though he added that he has generally supported their stands 
many of their statements have been false and misleading he 
said 
however some lawmakers who voted against cutting short debate 
scoffed at the notion that fear of nra retaliation at reelection 
time was the reason it wasnt in my case im leaving here 
said retiring sen gordon humphrey rnh 
he said was against the measure because its habeas corpus 
provisions designed to end delays in carrying out executions were 
not written properly 
nra lobbyist david conover said in an interview wednesday that 
we werent out in the halls but we had mail out which i think 
most people would say is our most effective way of communicating 
he said the gun groups members may have grown complacent prior 
to a vote two weeks ago in which the senate narrowly rejected a move 
to strip gun curbs out of the bill he said that action created 
renewed energy among nra members and gun owners

said the soviet presidents forthright summit manner proves there is 
a new era in ussoviet relations 
of course we have differences said bush specifying 
lithuanian selfdetermination the emigration rights of soviet jews 
a unified germany as a nato member and the continued totalitarian 
regime in cuba 
these arent questions that can be solved simply or in a 
single summit bush told a fundraising luncheon for wisconsin gov 
tommy thompson 
bush summarized the outcome of a very productive summit as he 
began a twoday speaking trip on behalf of gop senate and 
gubernatorial candidates 
he later flew to illinois and from there was headed to iowa and 
nebraska 
in chicago bush told a republican fundraising event i believe 
last weeks summit can alter history

which should increase us grain sales to the soviet union by one 
million tons annually bush said it will bring bread to soviet 
consumers and business to the farmers of illinois 
several hundred people carrying lithuanian and other baltic 
states flags demonstrated outside the chicago hotel where bush 
spoke the president took note of the demonstrators in his speech 
telling his audience the protesters were all decent and honorable 
people 
the president said he too supports the selfdetermination 
rights of citizens of the baltic republics theres no difference 
between us at all on that he said 
meanwhile the white house hailed the decision by south african 
president fw de klerk to lift a fouryearold state of emergency 
calling the move another significant step toward creating a 
climate conducive to negotiations that will lead to a democratic 
nonracial south africa 
the statement issued by deputy white house press secretary alixe 
glen aboard air force one en route to milwaukee said the 
announcement builds on earlier decisions by president de klerk 
toward more open and free political debate

nelson mandela to the white house mandela will visit on june 25 de 
klerk at a later yet tobeannounced date 
much work remains to be done by all sides the white house 
statement continued however we are encouraged by the remarkable 
progress that has been made in recent months we look forward to 
the early beginning of a negotiating process it added 
in washington state department spokesman richard boucher noted 
that the administration cannot legally modify us sanctions against 
south africa until certain conditions are met 
boucher said us law requires that the state of emergency be 
lifted among other measures before the sanctions can be eased 
left unanswered for the time being he said is the impact on the 
legislation of the de klerks decision to lift the state of 
emergency in all but one province natal 
boucher added that the lifting of the sanctions must also await 
the release of all political prisoners in south africa this has 
not yet happened he said 
bush in his first speech since the superpower summit that ended 
sunday told his milwaukee audience as i chatted informally with 
president gorbachev at camp david i kept thinking that this new 
soviet leader committed to reform and openness is indeed a

which he addressed every issue on the table bush said and i 
take it as proof that we have indeed entered a new era in our 
relations with the ussr

missiles a cutback in chemical weapons stockpiles an agreement on 
nuclear testing and pacts on trade and grain sales as the key 
accomplishments of last weeks meetings

international trade talks by years end 
the united states is seeking the removal of european farm export 
subsidies over 10 years at the talks which have been underway in

researchers at johns hopkins university have 
shown that a candidate vaccine produced by genetic engineering 
fights the virus that produces aids according to a report published 
thursday 
the vaccine uses genesplicing techniques to produce a chain of 
proteins mimicking a portion of the surface of the the human 
immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids 
vaccines against viruses usually are made of the whole virus 
crippled so that it cannot cause the disease in question or killed 
virus 
writing in science the journal of the american association for 
the advancement of science the johns hopkins team said although 
the induction of virusspecific virusfighting responses is 
traditionally associated with attenuated livevirus vaccines our 
results demonstrate that envelope protein subunit vaccines which 
have greater inherent simplicity and safety may also induce the 
desired activity 
the candidate vaccine was injected into eight volunteers four 
times over 18 months an initial injection followed by three 
boosters 
at the end of 18 months three of the eight had developed a 
response in which the cells of their immune systems attacked the hiv 
virus and the cells it infected 
they did so without attacking the socalled innocent 
bystander uninfected cells of the immune system a major problem 
in aids research 
the test vaccine is a long way from being shown to be a possible 
weapon against aids further clinical tests which could take years 
to complete must be conducted before the vaccine could be used 
other vaccines also are being tested at other labs in which 
portions of the aids virus proteins are being used to try to trigger 
an immune response 
the johns hopkins team was led by rimas j orentas of the 
baltimore institutions department of pharmacology and molecular 
sciences and included james ek hildreth eugene obah michael 
polydefkis gale e smith mary lou clements and robert f siliciano

the national rifle association opens its 
annual convention in an unfriendly state friday hoping to restore 
its influence after losses in membership and legislative defeats 
across the country 
an estimated 20000 members will attend the convention in 
california which last year bucked the gun lobby and passed 
legislation banning more than 50 types of militarystyle assault 
rifles 
the organization which also has suffered legislative defeats in 
california new jersey maryland and florida won at least a 
temporary victory thursday when the us senate failed to stop a 
filibuster on a broad anticrime bill with new restrictions on 
semiautomatic weapons 
democratic leaders blaming the nra for their failure at first 
decided the bill was dead then sought a compromise to revive the 
measure 
nra lobbyist james j baker claimed the senate action showed the 
nra retains some legislative clout 
weve lost some battles the war is far from over baker 
said you look at the votes in the united states senate this 
morning and i think that gives you the proof that you need based on 
the fact that they decided a crime bill that contains a 
semiautomatic firearms bill would not go forward 
nra leaders expect to hear complaints about about the 
organizations legislative defeats and have scheduled a meeting 
saturday to field questions from the rank and file about them 
i think theres a great deal of frustration among the 
membership based on a very tough year baker said i think 
that youre going to see that frustration played out at the annual 
membership meeting 
the convention comes at a crucial time in the history of the 28 
millionmember organization along with legislative defeats the nra 
has lost support among law enforcement and has lost 240000 members 
in four years 
baker attributed some of the membership loss to a 10 increase in 
dues in recent years opponents of the nra see a badly damaged 
organization 
the national rifle association has suffered enormous losses 
said luis tolley western director of handgun control inc over 
the last 12 months youre looking at the worst period in the nras 
existence 
the nra faces divisions in its own ranks between members who feel 
the group has gone too far and members who want the nra to push 
harder against gun control 
one of the nras biggest losses was in the california legislature 
last year when lawmakers passed and republican gov george 
deukmejian signed a bill banning many kinds of assault rifles 
the bill was introduced after five children were slain and 29 
others were wounded in a schoolyard by a man with an assault rifle 
the man patrick purdy killed himself at the end of the jan 17 
1989 attack in stockton 
california also now requires a 15day waiting period for the 
purchase of rifles and shotguns 
elsewhere maryland voters approved a referendum in 1988 that 
bans sale and manufacture of cheap handguns known as saturday night 
specials 
this year in new jersey gov james florio signed what he called 
the nations strongest ban on sale and possession of assault weapons 
one nra problem in fighting gun controls has been loss of support 
among police los angeles county sheriff sherman block and los 
angeles police chief darryl gates speak in favor of legislation 
banning assault weapons 
gun control advocates say the nra has gone too far in its 
lobbying 
five or 10 years ago you wouldnt have seen the police doing 
what theyre doing now said tolley the nra has gone off the 
deep end 
baker acknowledged that loss of law enforcement groups hurt but 
he contends the nra has only lost support among police leadership 
groups 
by and large the rank and file law enforcement officers the 
officer that walks the beat that comes into contact with the 
criminal element in this country supports the position that gun 
control laws do not do anything to deter criminals he said 
the convention features vendors pushing shotguns handguns 
bullets crossbows bulletproof vests air guns boots and 
camouflage jackets

a us army major testified the 
salvadoran colonel heading the inquiry into the murder of six jesuit 
priests knew who was responsible weeks before he told senior 
authorities the supreme court reported thursday 
the court also confirmed that military log books considered key 
evidence in the case were burned by one of the defendants on orders 
from a higher officer 
a court communique said that judge ricardo zamora who is 
investigating the jesuit slayings formally included as evidence a 
sworn declaration from the major it did not name the major but he 
has been identified as eric buckland who until january was part of 
the us military group here 
buckland told the same thing to a us congressional commission 
studying the jesuit slayings the commissions report was released 
april 30 
bucklands testimony gained significance for being formally 
included as evidence 
he testified that col carlos aviles told him dec 20 of the 
involvement of col guillermo benavides in the massacre of the 
jesuits their housekeeper and her daughter the eight were killed 
before dawn nov 16 on the campus of central american university 
where the jesuits taught 
buckland said aviles based his assertion on a conversation with 
another salvadoran colonel ivan lopez y lopez 
lopez y lopez had been told by col manuel rivas the head of the 
usfunded special investigative unit investigating the massacre 
said buckland in his statement 
according to this version benavides admitted his involvement to 
rivas asking the investigating colonel what can you do to help 
me 
according to bucklands version of events at least three 
salvadoran colonels aviles lopez y lopez and rivas lied to us 
and salvadoran authorities looking into the killing of the jesuits 
aviles has denied telling buckland about any conversation between 
benavides and rivas and has been called by zamora to provide sworn 
testimony 
both aviles and buckland took lie detector tests in january 
according to the us congressional commission the polygraph 
results indicated some deception in both cases 
in conversations with members of the congressional commission 
rivas and lopez y lopez denied bucklands allegations both refused 
to take lie detector tests 
after being briefed by rivas investigative unit president 
alfredo cristiani announced jan 7 that military personnel were 
involved in the jesuits massacre on jan 13 he said benavides 
three lieutenants and five other soldiers had been charged in the 
crime 
one a private is a fugitive 
the supreme court confirmed the 1989 log books of the military 
college where the unit that killed the jesuits was temporarily 
based were burned by lt rene mendoza in middecember 
mendoza is a defendant in the murder case 
the court communique said mendoza testified he burned the books 
on orders from thenmaj camilo hernandez who then was subdirector 
of the military college

city banks and transferred it to banks in albuquerque

nazi hunters on thursday submitted the names of 
nine more alleged war criminals living in britain to the government 
and protested a house of lords vote that killed a bill to prosecute 
such suspects 
efraim zuroff coordinator of the simon wiesenthal centers nazi 
war crimes center in jerusalem said he emphasized our sense of 
frustration and disappointment with what has happened to the bill 
when he provided the latest names to the home office 
we talked about the possibilities of deportation 
denaturalization and extradition said zuroff who came to london 
to see the house of lords vote tuesday 
he said the wiesenthal center which is based in los angeles 
wants to make sure if the bill is not reintroduced there will be 
some alternative so these people are not granted a safe haven in 
britain 
britain is the only world war ii ally without laws to prosecute 
suspected war criminals 
the government of prime minister margaret thatcher had backed the 
bill which was also passed by a large majority in the lower 
elected house of commons government officials could force the 
proposal through the unelected house of lords by reintroducing it in 
the fall but they have not yet announced their decision 
the nine new names bring the total number of alleged war 
criminals living in britain to 136 
the failed bill followed an inquiry by a governmentappointed 
commission that said there was enough evidence to prosecute three 
suspects for murder and investigate 124 others 
a home office spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
thursday the latest names were received but the government can 
investigate no further without a law allowing prosecution 
zuroff said names of alleged war criminals came from testimony of 
survivors in lithuanian jewish communities where nearly 250000 jews 
were killed during world war ii he added that more names were 
likely to result from further research in israel 
about 6 million jews were killed in the holocaust

a middleaged woman with a wad of dollar 
bills in her hand hesitated thursday before knocking on the door of 
a whiteframe bungalow adorned with yellow ribbons and balloons 
inside roy and marge heimdal huddled with their two daughters as 
friends and strangers alike scrambled to gather the 60000 ransom 
they hope will save the heimdals 27yearold son scott from south 
american kidnappers 
this is for your son the woman said as she quickly the money 
can i get your name heimdal 52 asked the woman 
it doesnt matter she responded 
the heimdals hoped to wire the money to ecuador by friday in 
order to make the kidnappers monday deadline the money will be 
given to an unidentified intermediary who will carry it into the 
jungles along the ecuadorcolombia border where their son scott 
disappeared april 28 
scott heimdal an engineer for a goldmining company near quito 
ecuador was traveling by boat when it was ambushed by maoist 
insurgents who killed the boat pilot wounded a passenger and 
kidnapped heimdal and an ecuadoran student 
the kidnappers subsequently released the student with two letters 
written by heimdal one to his family and the other to his company 
iminco co the letters contents were not revealed 
the kidnappers have several several photographs of heimdal to 
prove he was alive 
one of them shown to reporters thursday by jeffrey fino manager 
of the mining company that employs heimdal shows the captive 
sitting down encircled by several armed men 
the elder heimdal said the photo appeared similar to pictures the 
family had seen previously 
us and ecuadoran officials refused to comment on negotiations 
between the kidnappers and family 
a us diplomatic source said heimdal was in colombian territory 
we assume that his life is in danger said the source who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
mrs heimdal 47 said the kidnappers reportedly members of a 
colombian guerrilla group known as the popular liberation army have 
threatened to show us where his body is unless they get paid 
its not easy to strip your soul in front of the whole 
country mrs heimdal said were trying to keep our dignity 
but we had no other way to save our son than to go public like this 
our fear is so big right now 
on wednesday state department spokesman dave denny said the 
family was advised not to pay any ransom in keeping with us 
policy but families are free to do what they must do 
since the heimdals went public the people of peoria and 
elsewhere have been offering help 
ive been following their story in the paper said oscar 
boehl who delivered a few dollars in his pickup truck this is 
the kind of story that gets anybody or it should im not wealthy 
but everyone can kick in a few bucks every little bit helps 
steakhouses taverns and sandwich shops have joined the cause to 
raise ransom money nursing homes have held bake sales and 
waitresses have donated their tips 
about 35000 had been raised by thursday night the missing 
mans father said 
for the heimdals the kidnapping is just the most recent in a 
string of personal problems 
in 1981 when peorias economy plunged into deep recession 
heimdal was forced to leave the real estate business his line of 
work since 1969 the family moved to chetek wis opening a cabinet 
business and flower shop 
then in 1983 mrs heimdal was critically injured in a wreck with 
a drunken driver she suffered head and back injuries and memory 
loss her injuries required her to be hospitalized for most of two 
years 
medical bills surpassed 300000 and when their insurance ran 
out the family was forced to sell everything to pay the bills 
i cant remember my kids as babies and my speech was 
affected mrs heimdal said we sold everything and moved back 
to peoria in 1988 
heimdal still works in the cabinet business and mrs heimdal is 
active in mothers against drunk driving 
the family maintains faith that their son will return home safely 
my dream is coming home on a plane with scott and being met at 
the peoria airport by hundreds of people and all of them holding 
yellow ribbons mrs heimdal said scott belongs to this 
community now they are fighting for his life just like we are

the defense ministry announced thursday that france 
exploded its second nuclear device in a week at the testing site 
under mururoa atoll in the south pacific 
the explosion early friday south pacific time drew immediate 
fire from prime minister geoffrey palmer of new zealand who said 
france seemed determined to continue testing no matter what it cost 
in terms of relations with the south pacific 
the blast released a force of less than 12 kilotons the ministry 
said in a communique that is slightly more than half the power of 
the world war ii bomb that destroyed hiroshima 
a kiloton is equal to the explosive force of 1000 tons of tnt 
on saturday france made its first announcement of a nuclear 
explosion in 15 years after detonating a 15kiloton device 
president francois mitterrand pledged a new policy of openness last 
month during a visit to french polynesia 
the world previously learned of french tests from new zealand 
which has monitored frances nuclear program from an observation 
station in the cook islands 
palmer commented on friday from new zealands point of view 
the only announcement we want to hear is that they are stopping 
testing 
he said they already know that their nuclear tests are 
rejected by all countries of the region however we will continue 
to make this point unmistakably clear every time they explode one of 
their nuclear devices 
premier michel rocard said recently france would reduce the 
number of nuclear tests each year at mururoa from eight to six

jesse jackson met with marion barry thursday 
and said later the embattled mayor was open to talks on a plea 
bargain agreement on his drug and perjury charges 
meanwhile jury selection dragged on for a fourth day in us 
district court and it is expected to continue well into next week 
jackson in a televised interview said of barry he is open to 
talks as opposed to a drawingtheline situation i am rather 
convinced the mayor is inclined to do something to break the 
cycle and break the tension 
at the same time barrys spokeswoman lurma rackley said the 
mayor had no intention of announcing in the next day or two that he 
would not seek reelection she said she asked barry about reports 
to that effect and he told her if you hold your breath youll 
die 
negotiations leading to a guilty plea on one or more of the 14 
charges barry faces have stalled according to sources close to 
barrys legal team 
were nowhere right now said one source familiar with the 
negotiations between barry attorney r kenneth mundy and us 
attorney jay b stephens its increasingly unlikely that we will 
have any agreement soon said the source who commented only on 
condition of anonymity 
talk of a possible plea bargain dominated attention at the trial 
wednesday after jackson publicly urged barry to announce he would 
not run for a fourth term jackson suggested such a statement would 
nudge prosecutors toward allowing barry to plead guilty to a 
drugpossession misdemeanor rather than one of the three perjury 
felony counts he faces 
pleading guilty to a felony would bar barry from holding office 
or running for reelection and would make a jail sentence more 
likely 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor charges of 
cocaine possession one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge and 
three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his 
alleged drug use 
meanwhile jackson associates said the civil rights leader and 
former democratic presidential hopeful has been urging barry 
privately for six weeks to abandon his reelection plans and seek a 
plea bargain agreement 
according to sources close to both men barry wants jackson to 
run for mayor if he steps aside and jackson does not want to do so 
however barrys spokeswoman later denied that the mayor was 
urging jackson to succeed him thats totally totally untrue 
ms rackley said 
jackson who moved to washington last year flirted with a 
candidacy before announcing in february he would not run for mayor 
mundy would not comment on the plea bargain issue during a lunch 
break from the jury selection process of the trial 
in court questioning of prospective jurors continued slowly 
us district court judge thomas penfield jackson is going 
alphabetically through a list of more than 200 people who have 
filled out questionnaires for the barry case jackson plans to 
review all 200plus applications and have lawyers for the two sides 
question them rather than stopping with a pool of 40 to 45 people as 
is more customary 
the shorter approach for picking a jury pool from which a panel 
of 12 jurors and six alternates would be chosen was used in the 
recent highprofile trials of oliver north and john poindexter 
jackson himself used such an approach in the case of former white 
house aide michael deaver 
in the barry case 37 people have been sent into the jury pool so 
far 
also on thursday the american civil liberties union said it will 
file a brief with the judge asking him to reject any plea bargain 
that includes barrys resignation

an oil tanker ran aground thursday spilling 
260000 gallons of heating oil into a busy shipping channel between 
new jersey and new york and the first mate was arrested for 
substance abuse 
it was the fifth major oil spill in the area since january 
footballsize globs of oil washed ashore on both sides of the 
kill van kull waterway which was closed to ships after the tanker 
bt nautilus hit bottom while docking thursday morning bathing 
beaches on new jerseys atlantic shore werent expected to be 
affected officials said 
the first mate identified in court documents as gregory 
frederick geoffrey 52 of merkse england pleaded innocent 
thursday night to charges of operating a vessel under the influence 
of alcohol or drugs and negligent discharge of a pollutant without a 
permit 
his attorney richard f x regan said after the evening 
arraignment it appears that my client is really a scapegoat at 
this point in time for what appears to be an accident 
christopher florentz a spokesman for attorney general robert j 
del tufo said he didnt know if geoffrey was accused of using 
alcohol or drugs officials didnt immediately disclose what role 
geoffrey had in guiding the tanker 
bayonne municipal court judge frank t carpenter iii set bail at 
50000 and ordered the ship to surrender geoffreys passport 
drug tests were ordered for other ship workers and the harbor 
pilot who was on board to help steer the ship to dock 
oil leaked for almost five hours from the ship which was 
carrying 12 million gallons of heating fuel said coast guard rear 
adm richard rybacki in boston 
divers found a gash about 30 feet long and 12 to 16 inches wide 
in one of the ships tanks rybacki said the tank holds 12 million 
gallons 
new york lt gov stan lundine after a helicopter tour of the 
area with new york environmental conservation commissioner thomas 
jorling called the spill serious 
there are areas on beaches and in coves which are clearly 
contaminated with this very heavy oil he said 
the recent rash of spills in kill van kull and connecting arthur 
kill have brought harsh criticism of the oil industry from 
environmentalists and state officials the waterways separate new 
jersey from new yorks staten island and lie along a heavily 
industrialized area 
new york attorney general robert abrams said his office was 
conducting civil and criminal investigations into the spill 
coast guard chief petty officer gene hoff said booms were strung 
around the ship to contain the floating oil vacuum and skimming 
equipment were being used to clean up the slick and up to 300 
workers were expected to use rakes shovels and absorbent material 
to clean the shoreline 
it looks like mud really disgusting said margaret capuana 
of jersey city who went to a park at the southern tip of bayonne to 
see the crippled tanker 
the tanker is owned by nautilus motor tanker of gibraltar and 
operated by bulk tanker management of london the vessel is 
registered in hong kong 
richard bartha a rutgers university microbiology professor said 
the waterways have suffered such environmental destruction in recent 
months that only birds were likely to suffer serious harm 
there is little living in the water anymore because the water 
quality is so bad he said 
thursdays spill prompted new york and new jersey members of 
congress to ask that house speaker thomas foley add a proposal to 
require double hulls on oil tankers into an oil spill bill being 
considered by a housesenate committee 
the waterways have been plagued with major oil spills this year 
on jan 12 567000 gallons of oil leaked into the arthur kill 
from a ruptured exxon underwater pipeline 
on feb 28 30000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the kill 
van kull from a barge anchored in bayonne a day later nearly 4000 
gallons of heavy crude oil spilled into the arthur kill at exxons 
refinery in linden 
about a week later more than 100000 gallons of heating oil was 
dumped in the arthur kill near linden from a barge that exploded and 
caught fire

officials newspapers and businessmen on 
thursday protested a us decision to keep colombia out of an 
international trade agreement 
the decision by washington came one day after president bush 
promised to help the country fight its drug war 
the united states on wednesday decided not to give colombia 
preferential treatment under the subsidies code of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade gatt colombia sends 40 percent of 
its exports to the united states 
angry colombians called the decision hostile since the united 
states had said it would help the country defeat its violent drug 
traffickers 
on tuesday bush met with president virgilio barco in washington 
and reiterated the us pledge to aid colombia economically 
the president of the national association of exporters ricardo 
sala gaitan on thursday called the us rejection a a slap in the 
face 
there is a contradiction that can only be called spectacular 
between the smiles of president bush in the photographs with 
president barco and the attitude of his own government he said in 
an interview with the rcn radio network 
the subsidies code would require us companies to prove they had 
been damaged by colombian exports before any trade sanctions could 
be applied 
under the current arrangement if us companies claim injury 
the burden rests on colombia to prove otherwise 
a us embassy spokesman told the associated press that us 
policy is not to admit countries into the subsidies code unless 
there exists a bilateral agreement governing subsidies 
every new country has to have a bilateral agreement with us in 
which they agree to phase out their own export subsidies the 
spokesman said on condition of anonymity 
colombian development minister maria mercedes de martinez said in 
a news conference that 30 countries approved colombias request in 
geneva to join the subsidies code but that the united states 
rejected it 
martinez was quoted in the bogota daily el espectador as saying 
the decision cannot be justified when our country is going through 
serious difficulties which the rest of the world is well aware of 
el espectador itself condemned the decision 
the north american attitude is a real slight by president bush 
who says he supports colombias war against the drug cartels but

leaders of the warsaw pact on thursday began 
transforming their 35yearold alliance from a military to a 
political body declaring the enemy image of east and west to be 
a thing of the past 
members of the kremlinled alliance also discussed various roles 
for a united germany in europe said deputy foreign minister yuli 
kvitsinsky but he indicated there was no agreement 
the leaders also declared their readiness for constructive 
cooperation with archrival nato 
they said they favor the formation of a new alleuropean 
security system and the creation of a single europe of peace and 
cooperation without artificial barriers and ideological 
hostility 
to do this it has become necessary to reconsider the character 
and functions of the warsaw treaty its members said in a 
declaration adopted at the meeting new proposals on such a 
transformation will be drawn up before the end of october 
the prevailing view was that we have to emphasize the political 
component in the warsaw treaty organization activities kvitsinsky 
said at a news conference 
soviet and east european sources familiar with the thinking of 
government leaders have said that the envisioned new political 
structure of the warsaw pact would be patterned roughly after the 
nato secretariat and council in brussels although no firm plans 
have been disclosed 
we have to broaden the consultative basis of the warsaw treaty 
organization activities and perhaps we should go in the direction 
of curtailing the military structures kvitsinsky said 
warsaw pact members include bulgaria czechoslovakia east 
germany hungary poland romania and the soviet union yugoslavia 
and albania are no longer members of the pact which has been 
criticized by some of its members as outdated given the 
prodemocratic reforms in eastern europe since 1989 
romanian president ion iliescu said the view was unanimous at the 
meeting to move away from military aspects and focus on the 
political nature of the organization founded 35 years ago 
all the participants spoke in favor of developing and adapting 
the treaty on the line of the processes under way in europe now so 
that the development of the political character of the treaty could 
be emphasized iliescu told soviet television 
czechoslovak president vaclav havel arriving in prague said the 
meeting was probably the most important in the history of this 
body because it paved the way for the warsaw pact to proceed with 
the transformation of the security order in europe 
havel said czechoslovakia presented the draft of the new order 
for the warsaw pact to its members last week and deputy foreign 
ministers from the nations worked on it through the night wednesday 
and thursday 
participants in the meeting are unanimous in their opinion that 
the ideological enemy image has been overcome by mutual efforts of 
the east and the west while the notions of east and west are again 
acquiring their purely geographical meaning the declaration said 
confrontation elements contained in documents of the warsaw 
treaty and the north atlantic treaty organization that were adopted 
in the past are no longer in line with the spirit of the times 
it said 
a provisional commission of government representatives of the 
member nations will work out proposals on transforming the alliance 
before the end of october and the political consultative committee 
the group that met in moscow on thursday will examine them 
before the end of november the declaration said 
havel said he proposed that the committees plans on a new 
security order in europe be put before a 35nation summit in paris 
in december the conference on european security and cooperation is 
the successor to the one that issued the 1975 helsinki final act 
it also called for the full implementation of the basic human 
rights and freedoms 
despite statements before the meeting by hungarian prime minister 
joszsef antall that he wants to remove his country from the 
alliance kvitsinsky said there wasnt a single statement made 
relating to a wish to quit the warsaw treaty organization 
havel too said he stressed that czechoslovakia remain in the 
pact in order to oversee its transformation 
kvitsinsky said that all participants said the warsaw pact has 
to be adapted to new circumstances 
he added that the topic of reorganizing the warsaw pacts 
integrated military command also was brought up the complex 
structure places soviet commanders over member armies in the event 
of war 
the warsaw pact members also heard a detailed report by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev on his washington summit last week 
with president bush 
the possibility of a united germany being a member of both 
alliances was raised kvitsinsky said along with other scenarios of 
its political and military status 
havel and czechoslovak foreign minister jiri dienstbier also 
indicated there was no agreement on future security arrangements for 
a united germany the soviets oppose nato membership for a united 
germany and gorbachev and bush failed to resolve their differences 
over the issue last week

a former us soldier convicted of 
spying for the east bloc leaked documents on nato and american 
troops in europe the chief federal prosecutors office said 
thursday 
former army sgt 1st class clyde lee conrad was found guilty of 
high treason and sentenced to life in prison in west germany on 
wednesday after a court in koblenz found he had passed classified 
secrets to hungary and czechoslovakia for a decade 
late thursday the fbi announced that its agents had arrested 
another former soldier on spying charges in an outgrowth of the 
conrad case 
a court in the west german state of rhinelandpalatinate in 
which the spying occurred found the 43yearold conrad guilty of 
providing classified material to the hungarian and czechoslovak 
secret services from 1975 through 1985 
it was the first time a foreign resident living in west germany 
had been tried for espionage 
it estimated he received 12 million for his efforts 
the native of sebring ohio had been in charge of the classified 
document center at the armys 8th infantry division in bad 
krueznach 50 miles west of frankfurt during the majority of his 
time with the unit 
a top official in the chief federal prosecutors office in 
karlsruhe alexander prechtel said thursday that conrad had turned 
over defense strategic papers to the hungarian and czechoslovak 
secret services 
the documents concerned nato and american troops in germany and 
europe prechtel said but he would not elaborate 
of the classified documents conrad leaked prechtel said 
normally everything goes to the soviet union but we can only 
prove the way to czechoslovakia and hungary and the rest is 
speculation 
prechtel said authorities in czechoslovakia and hungary had not 
cooperated in the investigation 
but thats quite normal those countries who are involved in 
the case they are not asked to cooperate he said 
in tampa the fbi arrested another soldier in conrads unit 
roderick james ramsey and accused him of violating espionage laws 
against gathering or delivering defense information for a foreign 
government 
fbi director william s sessions said the investigation was one 
of the most complicated of its kind ever undertaken by the bureau 
and the information passed on was extremely sensitive 
in reporting wednesday night that ramsay had been targeted by the 
fbi abc news said the espionage ring had smuggled computer parts 
from the united states to the east bloc through canada 
prechtel denied that conrad was involved in smuggling computer 
parts 
he said west germans had no other investigation pending in 
connection with the conrad case but pointed out that the united 
states had given west germany the information for conrads 
prosecution 
because conrad had retired in west germany with his german wife 
and son he had to be prosecuted by german authorities 
us authorities in west germany referred all questions regarding 
conrad and possible other investigations to washington 
conrads bonnbased lawyer klaus huemmerich said he would 
appeal the judgment 
chief judge ferdinand schuth said conrad endangered the entire 
defense capability of the west and that the former sergeant was 
motivated by pure greed 
had war broken out the judge said the information passed by 
conrad could have led to a breakdown in the defenses of the 
western alliance and to capitulation and the use of nuclear 
weapons on german territory 
schuth sentenced conrad to life imprisonment for spying for the 
hungarians he said conrad was also guilty of spying for 
czechoslovakia on a lesser scale and he sentenced him to four years 
in prison on that charge 
conrad was arrested aug 23 1988 on suspicion of heading a west 
germanbased international spy ring with eastern contacts in sweden 
and vienna austria 
conrad who retired after 20 years in the military served with 
the army from 1965 to september 1985 and had lived in west germany 
since his discharge 
according to court records conrad was introduced to the 
hungarian secret service in late autumn 1975 by his supervisor in 
the 8th infantry division former us army sgt 1st class zoltan 
szabo 
szabo who was convicted of espionage in austria in 1989 
received a 10month suspended sentence he identified for 
investigators some of the documents the court said conrad sold to 
the hungarians 
two hungarians sandor kercsik and his brother imre were 
described by the court as conrads main contacts 
the two were arrested in 1988 in sweden and admitted being agents 
of the hungarian secret police they were sentenced to 18 months in 
prison for possessing nato defense material 
the kercsik brothers also provided statements to the rhineland 
palatinate state court with evidence implicating conrad

universal studios florida held a glitzy 
hollywoodstyle inaugural thursday in a 630 million gamble that it 
can compete with entertainment giant walt disney world on its own 
turf 
the combination film production center and tourist park also is 
an important test of whether its parent company mca inc and 
partner rank organization plc of london can export the same concept 
to europe and japan again following in disneys footsteps 
we think theres a terrific market out there for hightech 
theme parks said mca vice president jay stein the foreign 
prospects are excellent 
success here would set the pace for a breakout from mcas basic 
business of filmmaking into tourist parks in this country and 
overseas 
universal studio tour in los angeles opened in 1964 but the 
444acre florida complex is a bigger more sophisticated version 
considered a prototype for the future by company officials 
besides the formidable competition posed by walt disney worlds 
three attractions just a few miles down the road from universal 
disneys also got the jump on foreign shores 
euro disneyland is scheduled to open outside paris in 1992 and 
tokyo disneyland has been in operation since 1983 mca has announced 
plans for a theme park in japan in partnership with nippon steel 
stein who headed the creative team that built the florida park 
said an announcement of a site for mcaranks european enterprise 
could come within a month locations near paris and london are under 
consideration mca officials say 
but much depends on whether universal can get a healthy portion 
of the 13 million annual visitors to central florida 
with a daily capacity of 40000 to 50000 mca expects to host 
from 5 million to 6 million people its first year 
richard p simon an entertainment analyst for goldman sachs in 
new york said mca probably needs only about 3 million visitors a 
year to break even 
i think theyll be profitable in the first full year he 
said initially the market will not be large enough to accomodate 
the large jump in capacity but i think in time it will be 
the disneymgm studios which celebrated its first anniversary 
may 1 racked up 8 million visits in its first year disney 
records turnstile counts meaning some guests can be counted more 
than once during a visit 
disney has been luring tourists to central florida for almost two 
decades and is one of the industrys top merchandising experts the 
magic kingdom opened in 1971 and epcot center began operating in 
1982 
the two companies have been caught up in a promotional frenzy in 
recent weeks spending money lavishly on radio television and 
newspaper advertising as well in the traveltrade press 
universal studios president steven lew said wednesday that 
mcarank and its partners in the orlando attraction will spend a 
total of 150 million this year in advertising and merchandising the 
630 million park 
entertainment analysts say disney is spending at least 50 
million to market all three of the florida parks this fiscal year

a wonderful actress named eileen atkins is 
playing the title role in prin which is more an interesting 
character study than a play 
prin by andrew davies opened at offbroadways manhattan 
theater club on wednesday davies rose starred glenda jackson 
on broadway nearly a decade ago and also was about a teacher 
prin upgrades its title character to principal of an english 
teachertraining college specializing in science dance and physical 
education 
it is to davies credit that he maintains suspense in the midst 
of several different situations 
the play starts slowly in the principals office with prin 
urging vice principal dorothy dibs played with wan charm by amy 
wright to mimicry and flights of fancy its clear though they 
dont say so untill later that theyre lovers prin had chosen the 
younger woman from a dance class 
dorothy would still like to be called dorothy but prin who 
plows through life ignoring other peoples desires even those of 
someone she loves calls dorothy little dibs 
its clear that dorothy isnt a committed lesbian and probably is 
about to leave prin for a man 
its also clear that the college will go under merging with 
either a university or a technical school prin might have a 
formidable personality that could intimidate a board of directors 
but she doesnt rely on that its inconceivable to prin that the 
college will fold living largely in her imagination and without a 
single ace in her hand she simply believes that shell win through 
early in act 1 prin speaks to graduates you are all of you 
excellent she tells them that teachers can show children how to 
be extraordinary and change the world its clear she has devoted 
her life to that belief 
less admirably prin is elitist really interested only in people 
with superior minds the prima donnas as opposed to the job 
lots 
prins life does crash and crumble and atkins brilliantly puts 
her heartbreak in her face 
but prins blunt approach to life and her beliefs sustain her 
out of a job she is seen at the end lecturing to a group whose name 
she doesnt know you look a pretty rum bunch she tells them 
then as fervently as she had with the college graduates she 
lectures them about the holiness of the hearts affections the 
truth of the imagination and the pursuit of the extraordinary 
john curless and john christopher jones were good as teachers 
wendy makkena squirmed nicely as a promiscuous student with low 
selfesteem remak ramsay played the merger sponsor he seemed 
uncomfortable telling prin hed always hated her possibly one too 
many emotions from the author 
john lee beatty designed the set john tillinger directed

because of the shelling judges seldom 
hold people in jail awaiting trial but artillery fire also keeps 
judges and lawyers away from work so an accused can wait a long 
time for his day in court 
murder burglary and other crimes still are against the law after 
15 years of ruinous civil war but the battle often overruns what 
remains of the criminal justice system 
months of fighting trapped about 420 prisoners being held on 
charges of murder theft and drug trafficking the showdown between 
christian factions led by gen michel aoun and samir geagea has 
taken nearly 1000 lives and wounded more than 2500 people since 
jan 30 
a lawyer who fled to moslem west beirut said judicial authorities 
were unable to meet to consider dozens of cases of people awaiting 
prosecution for common crimes 
they were arrested and jailed and now their fate depends on 
the situation said the lawyer 
the palace of justice where the meetings normally are held is 
on the confrontation line between geageas areas of influence and 
aouns terrain it is subject to constant sniper fire and shelling 
we have been trying to form a committee to meet anywhere in 
order to take a decision to release the prisoners on bail pending a 
trial when security conditions permit said the judge who 
demanded anonymity like the others interviewed 
i switched on the tv one night and saw gunmen sniping from my 
office at the palace of justice we obviously cannot meet there 
according to the lawyer some colleagues paid quick visits to the 
palace of justice to hide or remove files but it is not possible 
to operate normally from there 
the jails are in the most heavily shelled areas of roumieh 
baabda and furn elshubbak all held by aoun the judge said 
roumieh prison is the biggest aouns main howitzer batteries are 
deployed in a wooded valley around it partially protected from 
geageas fire 
the prisons are so crowded and in such dangerous areas that 
whenever we can meet we try to release most of the detainees who 
have committed minor offenses on bail set at a minimal amount the 
judge said 
we also have no wards to treat drug addicts so again we tend 
to set them free on bail because if we place them in prison theyll 
be more corrupted by other prisoners 
few jails have bomb shelters and the guards generally flee when 
shelling starts 
about fifty inmates escaped from a prison in moslem west beirut 
last year when artillery fire knocked down cell walls during aouns 
sixmonth battle with syrian soldiers and their moslem allies only 
about 30 were caught 
the christian feud has stopped family visits to prisoners and 
telephones went dead months ago 
the lack of security also means prisoners could receive 
visitors only during lulls in the fighting the judge said 
those who have family and friends in geageacontrolled areas 
havent had visitors since the clashes began 
the judge said some prisoners who finished their terms might be 
safer in jail but were not allowed to stay 
if they are known to have been geagea supporters before they 
were imprisoned theyre in trouble for the prisons are in an area 
under aouns control he said

open the wallet of louis b jones and youll find 
a california drivers license a slip of yellow paper scribbled 
messages and a counterfeit 20 bill 
the bill is printed on typing paper stained by tea its dated 
1985 and has the signature of then secretary of the treasury james 
a baker iii on the lower righthand side you can tell its fake by 
scratching it against a hard surface and watching the ink run off 
also the green is much paler than real currency 
no jones is not a crook and hes not playing a board game 
jones is a writer the fake bill was part of research for his first 
novel ordinary money 1895 viking in which the author 
imagines the serious conseqences of a little funny money 
a catalyst was andre gides novel the counterfeiters said 
the author a native of chicago who now lives in mill valley calif 
its about a bunch of children one of whom runs away from 
home gide seems to think money is the devil its about modern 
sensible people who dont think the devil exists even though it 
passes through his fingers every day 
ordinary money is a morality play complete with fake limbs 
real love near adultery and ever present federal agents the real 
the unreal and the surreal mix like coins in a piggy bank 
wayne paschke is trying to be sensible but its not easy he 
knows about bills real bills the kind that arrive at the first of 
the month a resident of californias marin county waynes has a 
wife a teenage daughter another kid on the way and a 
lessthanpromising career painting houses hes willing to take 
some chances to make money even try something a little silly like 
selling coins over the telephone 
in this practical mans garage sits a wooden crate crammed with 
20 bills printed on paper so authentic that even the feds think 
its real its a gift from his best friend randy potts a 
government unto himself looking to get rich with the speed of his 
illgotten red ferrari 
the author makes a cameo appearance randy has received the money 
from his boss a mysterious man who meets with him in parking lots 
of fastfood restaurants and offers instructions on how to pass the 
bucks 
jones named the boss auctor 
the latin name for author is auctor jones explained the 
fact that were both in the business of inventing images was very 
much on my mind when i go in a bookstore and see my book next to 
thomas pynchons i feel like a counterfeiter 
like wayne jones has stumbled a few times himself writing 
several unpublished novels heading for new york to become an author 
and leaving scared defeated brokenhearted about my 
possibilities 
in ordinary money jones writes 
the old wayne paschke would have found marketrend ridiculous 
but exactly when things seemed most absurd that was the moment when 
the successful man plunges forward without admitting the possibility 
of defeat almost irrationally 
jones admits hes also taken some awkward plunges 
when i was 17 or 18 i got involved with something called 
bestline which is something like amway bestline is soap you 
studied this book about selfesteem and go to these meeting and 
stir a lot of enthusiasm 
what youre competing for is the cadillac a bonus cadillac if 
you get enough points you get a pink cadillac i really kind of 
believed it for two months like wayne it was a happy mistake i 
learned by becoming someone else living with different values it 
was a kind of schizophrenic experience 
research for ordinary money began in 1985 when jones set up 
various bleaches on his kitchen counter printed specimens on typing 
paper and trimmed them with a paper cutter 
two years later he took another plunge jones headed for the 
bureau of engraving and printing in washington enduring the 
occasional eviction by angry security guards as he sought official 
advice on how to break the bank 
on paper at least jones succeeds writing of computerdriven 
lasers argon lasers and flying spot scanners making the process of 
counterfeiting seem as simple as selling detergent 
in real life however the author reports that he can do no 
better than invent the perfect crime 
its unhappy i hate to be the man who says theres no mary 
poppins said jones holding a real bill in his hands but the 
perfect counterfeit bill is not yet a technological possibility it 
almost is

one reason why the governments mortgage 
insurance program could go broke is that in some respects it has 
been skewed to reward those who dont need it and deny those who do 
it is just one of many defects in the nations public housing 
program many of which developed during the tenure of samuel pierce 
jr the former secretary of housing and urban development 
it is also another chapter in a big book of how another 
wellintended government program one that theoretically could make 
homeownership more possible for the poor becomes twisted in the 
practical application 
that twist has helped produce some incredible losses in the 
singlefamily homemortgage program the federal housing 
administrations singlefamily mortgage programs for example lost 
more than 1 billion in 1988 
critics to be found everywhere in congress in the fha itself 
among lenders and among neighborhood action groups fear that by 
the end of the decade the government insurance program could become 
another sampl debacle 
that financial disaster for those who need reminding could cost 
american taxpayers as much as a halftrillion dollars and some 
blame for it can be attributed to poor government supervision and 
regulation 
the fha mortgage insurance program like government guarantees on 
deposits in now insolvent savings and loan associations is also 
victimized by some lax regulation bad loans and favoritism toward 
certain borrowers 
designed with middleincome and lowincome homebuyers in mind it 
has in some instances become a financing tool for yuppies who it 
often turns out may be poorer risks than the poor that at least 
is what the figures show 
providing 100 percent insurance on loans to yuppies in 
speculative housing markets is a surefire recipe for a new federal 
bailout this time of the fha says gale cincotta chairman of 
national peoples action 
to cincotta an authority on community reinvestment and housing 
she was appointed by hud secretary jack kemp to a commission on 
affordable housing this is but one of many distortions of the 
federal housing administration program but a very significant one 
why should 100 percent governmentinsured loans be going to 
yuppies with good incomes and who have the option of obtaining a 
variety of other loans rather than to the more needy who have 
little or no other choice 
that however is the situation and that situation has still 
another dimension the bigger loans such as those that cincotta 
says go to the yuppies often have the highest foreclosure rate 
she refers to studies one by the mortgage insurance companies of 
american in 1989 and another just completed by the united guaranty 
residential insurance corp that demonstrate this correlation on 
privately insured mortgages 
she maintains that much the same pattern applies to fha loans 
that is the larger they are the stronger becomes the correlation 
with foreclosure and the reverse the smaller the loan the smaller 
the foreclosure ratio 
but why should fhainsured loans go to the more rather than less 
affluent because she says while the federal government might lose 
on them the lenders and brokers who originate the loans find them 
more profitable 
many mortgage companies imposed minimum loan amounts on fha 
loans even in violation of the law they do it simply by refusing 
to make loans under 25000 and by adding on points to loans under a 
certain amount such as 40000 
npa demonstrated this by calling the top five veterans 
administration and fha mortgage lenders in chicago philadelphia 
cleveland and milwaukee all employed minimum loan amounts or points 
for the smallest loans 
the reason why is understandable if not defendable every 
origination fee a mortgage banker receives is a percentage of the 
size of the loan the larger the loan the bigger the fee 
the fha sought to encourage smaller loans such as those to 
poorer people most in need of fha help by raising the annual 
servicing fee on the smaller loans but it apparently wasnt enough 
to turn the tide 
its outrageous that federal programs like fha are being used 
to discriminate against and rip off lower income and minority home 
buyers says cincotta 
cincottas chicagobased organization is a foundationsupported 
coalition of more than 200 housing groups it is allied with the 
national training and information center which develops and teaches 
ways to preserve neighborhoods

meanwhile back at the other summit the thawed 
cold war is a factor too budget negotiators have their sights on 
military spending and want to know how much more it can be cut 
because of what the diplomats have done 
the link between the budget summit and the superpower summit 
said to have marked the end of the cold war era is not as clear 
and direct as democratic leaders want to make it so as to press the 
case for sharp pentagon spending cuts 
at the budget talks bush convened with a white house sendoff a 
month ago theres no sign of a breakthrough any time soon those 
discussions have settled into a routine that may keep the 
negotiators at it most of the summer 
they havent yet started bargaining on specific steps to save or 
raise funds in order to reach the legal limit on this years 
deficit and avoid an electiontime slash in federal programs across 
the board such automatic spending cuts have happened before but 
this time the administration says the cuts would be so drastic that 
voters would feel the impact and congressional election candidates 
might too 
the deficit limit is 64 billion the budget summit is seeking 
agreement on steps to get close to that target with deficit 
estimates now ranging over 200 billion so far most of their time 
has been spent on technical questions basically on starting 
points for negotiation the negotiating teams for congress and the 
white house have agreed to meet daily from now on instead of 
convening twice a week 
they have yet to determine how much money has to be saved and 
raised in order to meet the legal limit and avoid punishing cuts 
next fall 
rep lee hamilton dind chairman of the joint economic 
committee has just issued a democratic study contending that overly 
optimistic administration forecasts mask the real size of deficits 
over the next five years 
if the budget agreement is not based on realistic and prudent 
assumptions the result will be an empty declaration of victory 
hamilton said 
any declaration of victory hollow or otherwise is a long way 
away 
this summit and the superpower summit reached something of a 
common denominator when secretary of defense dick cheney and brent 
scowcroft the presidents national security adviser talked with 
the budget bargainers last week 
that prompted the question of whether the diplomatic summit had 
produced accords that would prompt defense spending moves at the 
budget summit but the white house wasnt answering we arent 
willing to discuss any specifics of the budget negotiations said 
marlin fitzwater the presidents press secretary 
cheney wasnt bargaining on the administrations 3033 billion 
defense budget which democratic critics say is too high for a time 
of easing international tensions but he did agree to produce a 
pentagon study of what would happen to the defense budget should 
military force levels be cut by 25 percent over the next five years 
he said the pentagon already is analyzing that option 
that study doesnt mean the administration would sign off on such 
cuts and again as on the overall question of deficit projections 
the starting point for negotiation is not yet settled 
cheney and his pentagon planners contend that ebbing cold war 
tensions and steadily reduced defense spending already are factored 
in to their budget projections 
the military budget has declined in real terms since 1985 
secretary of the air force donald b rice told the detroit economic 
club last month based on the presidents budget defense has 
already been cut 12 to 13 percent in purchasing power 
our internal planning under secretary cheneys guidance will 
bring the department of defense to a total real decline of 22 
percent by 1997 he said 
defense outlays at that point would account for their lowest 
share of federal spending since before pearl harbor even without 
the cuts congress is certain to make 
by pentagon count over the 10 years beginning in 1985 defense 
budget reductions will total 515 billion 
rice said pentagon planners began factoring a peace dividend into 
their projections five years ago 
those arguments dont take with democratic leaders and with some 
republicans in congress they think theres much more to be cut out 
of military spending in the quest for a longterm budget and deficit 
settlement

ever since adam clayton powell the flamboyant 
playboypreacher from harlem was driven from his house seat in 
1967 black leaders have seen a conspiracy at work 
for years theyve said that the white power structure singles out 
any black politician who threatens the status quo and some who 
dont for relentless investigation and costly prosecution 
washington mayor marion barry jr on trial on drug and perjury 
charges after an elaborate fbi sting they say is just the latest 
victim of selective prosecution 
attorney general dick thornburgh denies that government 
prosecutors targeted barry or that they go after black politicians 
we follow the evidence wherever it leads regardless of 
position race party affiliation or other identifying factors 
thornburgh said in january he was responding to benjamin hooks 
executive director of the naacp who pictured barry as a victim of 
selective law enforcement 
hooks remains unconvinced in an interview he estimated that 80 
percent of the black people in washington share the perception that 
barry has been singled out 
us attorney jay stephens suggested that the government paid 
extraordinary attention to the barry case after years of rumors 
that he was using drugs because as mayor barry was a role model 
for the black youth of washington 
in court stephens called barrys arrest a personal tragedy for 
the defendant but added narcotics abuse is also a tragedy for 
this city narcotics abuse is not a victimless crime 
the issue of whether barry had been singled out because of his 
race came to dominate the jury selection process last week at his 
trial 
judge thomas penfield jackson asked prospective jurors if they 
believe the law is selectively enforced many of the blacks said 
they did 
it seems like some people are made to go through a little more 
than others said one a gospel singer they televised this too 
much talked about it too much i think race had a lot to do 
with it as far as giving him a hard time 
the judge asked if a white mayor would have been spared 
prosecution under similar circumstances 
exactly she said 
the masses of the people out there understand what is going 
on says clarence mitchell iii former maryland state legislator 
and onetime colleague with barry in the 1960s civil rights 
organization the student nonviolent coordinating committee 
the media can say barrys lifestyle is not appropriate but the 
masses of people perceive that if marion barry were white we would 
not be reading anything about him says mitchell 
mitchell says he too became a victim of selective prosecution 
as he was running in a primary for the nomination to a congressional 
seat vacated by his uncle parren mitchell 
mitchell lost the nomination he and his brother michael 
scions of a prominent black family and son of civil rights leader 
clarence mitchell jr were subsequently convicted of taking a 
bribe to block an investigation by parren mitchells house small 
business committee 
at the sentencing their mother juanita jackson mitchell 
alluded to their claim that they were victims of an fbi vendetta 
against black leaders 
my sons are casualties on the road to freedom she said 
thus say black leaders the mitchells joined a long list of 
black politicians who had been singled out 
on the list mayors maynard jackson of atlanta coleman young of 
detroit and richard arrington of birmingham ala former mayors 
carl stokes of cleveland kenneth gibson of newark nj and 
charles evers of fayette miss reps charles rangel dny 
harold ford dtenn and louis stokes dohio and former reps 
shirley chisholm dny and charles diggs dmich 
hooks says if they had accused barry of stealing millions 
creating a slush fund awarding corrupt contracts that would be one 
thing but a personal habit that is bad dangerous lethal that 
makes him a bad role model there are 4 million people out there 
doing it if there are 4 million why did they pick out one and 
stick on his case for eight years 
hooks is careful to say he is not passing judgment on barrys 
guilt or innocence instead he draws an analogy if everyone is 
going 80 miles an hour on the highway and youre doing 70 and the 
cops stop you youve got to wonder 
what im trying to say is the perception is there he says 
and the government has a right to dispel the perception if it 
isnt true 
adds joann watson who heads the national ywcas office of racial 
justice we are not supporting quote corrupt politicians 
joseph agne consultant to the national council of churches says 
he sees a motive behind selective prosecution this is one way to 
get around the gains from the voting rights act whose enactment 
raised the number of black elected officials from the scores to the 
thousands 
but lawyer richard a samp chief counsel for the conservative 
washington legal foundation says prosecutors lack the resources to 
bring charges against every lawbreaker he says it makes sense for 
them to focus first on officeholders 
blacks arent singled out he says but since there is likely to 
be more corruption at the local level and given that much of the 
black electoral success to date has been at the local level it is 
perhaps not surprising that blacks have been included among the 
targets of these corruption probes 
and louis michael seidman law professor at georgetown 
university points to a 19th century supreme court decision that 
selective prosecution of prominent wealthy people on tax charges 
for example is permissible as long as it is not based on such 
things as race or religion 
now that barry has admitted he used crack cocaine at the vista 
hotel on jan 18 his only recourse is to persuade a jury that he 
was unfairly singled out says seidman 
in reality that is his defense says seidman 
barry seemed to be saying as much when he told the washington 
post on may 28 i think the prosecutors know that in this town all 
it takes is one juror saying im not going to convict marion 
barry i dont care what you say 
mary r sawyer assistant professor of religious studies at iowa 
state university in ames has been studying the question of 
selective prosecution for years 
what is happening to black elected officials today is only 
marginally different from what happened to black activists in the 
black power and black civil right eras and to what happened to 
blacks during jim crow segregation days and what happened to blacks 
during slavery ms sawyer said 
in each instance the leaders were singled out there was a 
double standard there were steps taken to intimidate and terminate 
effective strategies for social change

plans to involve the army in fighting 
drugs which the united states supports have many bolivians worried 
that a largely peaceful lawenforcement effort will become a bloody 
war like the one in colombia 
proponents say only the military can control the vast lawless 
areas where cocaine traffickers now operate with impunity 
few shots have been fired in bolivias campaign against 
narcotics and bloodshed is rare 
a specially trained 600man police unit called the leopards 
works closely with the us drug enforcement administration in 
pursuing processors and traffickers growers of coca the base of 
cocaine are urged to switch crops voluntarily 
during a trip to washington in may however president jaime paz 
zamora agreed to commit about 900 soldiers in two army battalions to 
the effort and to increase air force and navy involvement 
in return bolivia will get 75 million worth of us military 
equipment and training during 199091 
paz zamora kept the agreement quiet preferring to emphasize 127 
million in economic aid pledged by the united states in the same 
twoyear period but it was leaked to the la paz newspaper 
presencia publication inspired protests from opposition politicians 
and labor unions 
presencia quoted jorge alderrete a former undersecretary of the 
interior as saying the government has put at risk all the 
countrys chances to achieve a peaceful solution to the drug 
trafficking problem it will do nothing more than prove an old 
axiom violence begets violence 
alderrete is a prominent member of the revolutionary nationalist 
movement the main political opposition 
bolivias army is better known for coups detat and corruption 
than combat skills a military government that took power in 1980 
even worked closely with cocaine traffickers 
the army also has a reputation for heavyhandedness when it is 
called in to put down strikes for instance bloodshed often results 
cocagrowing peasants militant and well organized have sworn 
they will resist any any military crackdown 
leading officers of the leopards also question the switch to a 
military approach 
maj carlos barriga leopard commander for the beni region said 
he would accept whatever help he could get but that army 
involvement can create big social problems weve had some 
experiences in the past 
the armed forces is an institution created to defend 
sovereignty from an exterior threat barriga said in an interview 
in trinidad capital of the beni i think the situation is being 
basically controlled now without violence 
the beni is an expanse of jungles and grasslands about the size 
of texas loaded with clandestine cocaine laboratories 
barriga said leopard and dea operations there had done a lot of 
damage to the traffickers he cited the discovery of 18 labs and 
10 important drug caches during 1989 
don ferrarone dea attache for bolivia said the most pressing 
need was additional transport and communications equipment so more 
leopards could take part in raids he said only about two dozen 
could be deployed for an operation by air because of shortages of 
planes and helicopters 
the first thing we need to attend to is fully applying the 
people we have out here he told the associated press in trinidad 
where he was directing helicopter and boat raids were not in a 
declared war and we have to take a stepbystep approach to applying 
the military 
those who favor military involvement including us ambassador 
robert gelbard say army action is needed if bolivia is going to 
nip in the bud what is developing into a real national threat 
cocaine traffickers operate beyond the laws reach in eastern and 
northern bolivia they are believed to control entire towns that 
police and us drug agents wont enter for fear of attack by 
townspeople 
we have to find ways to cover these areas gelbard said in an 
interview in la paz bolivia is no longer just a producer of 
coca leaf and paste it is now is a major producer of cocaine 
hydrochloride if the problem is ignored im afraid it really could 
become another colombia 
gelbard noted that some air force units have been involved in the 
antidrug effort for years flying a dozen vietnamera huey 
helicopters supplied by the united states the navy also interdicts 
drugs on jungle rivers 
some bolivian critics draw parallels between escalating the drug 
war and the us involvement in vietnam expressing concern about 
the increasing number of us advisers and trainers in bolivia 
to that argument gelbard responds you need advisers and 
trainers to avoid the problems other countries have had where 
charred carcasses of us helicopters lie in the valleys 
he said us training had produced a corps of bolivian air force 
helicopter pilots that was the best in latin america 
more than 100 us civilian and military officials are involved 
in the antinarcotics campaign 
green beret trainers run a base in the chapare cocagrowing 
region 
us army navy and air force advisers work with dea agents and 
the leopards us border patrol agents and a special coast guard 
unit carry out interdiction operations on roads and rivers 
some us civilian personnel such as dea coast guard and border 
patrol agents are allowed to take part in raids but american 
military personnel are limited to training and advising

coca farmers who agreed to switch crops 
waited hours to sign up for the government eradication program two 
months for officials to certify their coca plants had been destroyed 
and several weeks to be paid 
samuel zambrana 61 with seven children said he was going along 
with the plan but i have no income now and i cannot get my banana 
and orange crop out because of bad roads if the government is going 
to take coca away from us we need profitable alternative crops 
good roads and a market 
since dec 1 farmers have destroyed a record 4500 hectares of 
coca more than onetenth of the 38250 devoted to growing the crop 
from which cocaine is made according to us government figures a 
hectare is about 2 acres 
we continue to be very pleased with voluntary eradication 
programs and the commitment which the bolivian government continues 
to demonstrate the us embassy said 
tens of thousands of farmers have left the chapare cocaproducing 
region because of a sharp drop in prices for the leaf farmers 
receive 2000 from the bolivian government for every hectare 
destroyed 
voluntary eradication was spurred late last year when colombias 
drug war and increased interdiction in bolivia disrupted cocaine 
production and reduced the demand for coca leaves 
a 100pound sack of coca costs about 30 to produce and brought 
only 10 at the beginning of may compared with 100 five years ago 
but had risen to about 20 by the end of the month the increase 
caused concern that cocaine processing operations were resuming in 
colombia 
nearly onethird of the worlds coca leaves are produced in the 
chapare a lush tropical region in the heart of bolivia 
at least 300000 farmers depend on coca cultivation and cocaine 
production for a livelihood the government says the industry brings 
about 600 million a year into the economy 
leaves of the coca bush which resemble bay leaves are harvested 
four times a year dried and then macerated into paste with kerosene 
in plasticcovered pits the paste is refined into cocaine in labs 
in the bolivian lowlands colombia and brazil 
bolivia which has a population of 71 million is south 
americas poorest country and its largest recipient of us aid

aweil is a place where everything is in 
desperately short supply food money medicine hope 
especially hope when survival can depend on whether the train 
from muglad arrives 
as recently as december 4750 families waited in aweils refugee 
camps about 30000 people driven into the town by a seemingly 
endless civil war despair drove most of them back to the 
countryside to the risk of death from war lawlessness or famine 
only a few hundred women children and old men are in the camps 
now 
most of the families who left had been waiting for six to seven 
months for the relief train said mohamed ali of the local relief 
committee they saw no ray of hope so they moved out to the 
villages where they might find something to eat 
there is food at muglad a reliefdistribution center 160 miles 
north of aweil at the northern terminus of a rail line goods 
shipped from khartoum the capital 450 miles to the northeast are 
stockpiled there under operation lifelinesudan a relief program 
coordinated by the united nations 
operation lifeline was created after the famine of 1988 which 
took between 250000 and 500000 lives and resulted from a civil war 
that has raged in the southern part of africas largest nation since 
1983 
black rebels in the south which is predominantly christian and 
animist demand greater autonomy from the arab moslem north 
the relief project was credited with preventing a recurrence of 
the 1988 disaster last year but getting supplies into the area has 
been difficult 
trains often are weeks or months late in making the 160mile 
journey from muglad to aweil reasons range from the dilapidated 
track and the danger of land mines or attacks by rebels renegade 
soldiers or bandits to bad weather bureaucracy inadequate 
equipment and the reluctance of crews to risk the trip 
at the end of may a 150car train with 1500 tons of grain had 
been waiting at muglad for six months 
we have only 400 gallons of edible oil and nothing else said 
the rev akili malweth the local roman catholic bishop our 
stores are as empty as a hungry mans stomach 
four trains have brought supplies to aweil since operation 
lifeline began in 1989 on the return trip north each carried 
thousands of people trying to escape and survive 
those who could not move out of the town are the poor the old 
the tuberculosis victims and the children said mohamed ali who 
also is the local representative of the sudanese commission on 
relief and rehabilitation 
nearly all those remaining are women children and old men they 
are housed in two makeshift camps and few have money to buy anything 
one camp has nine large huts that accommodate 20 families each 
and the other is in the school alino kolong aweils education 
commissioner said those who lived in the school cleaned it each 
morning before classes began 
the women and many of the children try to find work 
refugee women till other peoples gardens and carry firewood and 
water from the center of town to outlying houses in aweil which has 
a normal population of 11000 
women here work in all sorts of jobs said majack khawaja a 
resident of the town even building houses which traditionally 
has been a mans job is now being done by women 
even if the refugee women can find work they seldom make enough 
money to buy food 
a cup of tea costs 10 sudanese pounds nearly 85 cents double 
the daily wage for the bestpaying jobs available 
they cannot afford to buy one sack of sorghum at the 
unimaginable price of 900 pounds or 75 for the 88pound bag 
kolong said sorghum is the staple food in sudan 
on a recent inspection tour officials of the un agencies 
running operation lifeline found the refugee families had no 
materials for cooking and were grinding peanuts in large bowls 
making paste so the nuts would go farther 
all the people here eat is peanuts mohamed ali said its 
not because they like them its because theyre cheaper peanuts 
sell at onethird the price of sorghum 
although the people of aweil looked relatively healthy relief 
officials said most had chronic tuberculosis or suffered from 
malaria or other waterborne diseases 
aweils drugstore had been empty for months 
dr samuel deng the areas only physician said the medical 
charity doctors without borders brought enough supplies for a year 
in february 1989 but no more had come the group left sudan after 
some of its workers were killed 
what medicine we have left cannot last for one week let alone 
until supplies come in no one knows how long deng said

relief workers call the two mudandgrass 
huts a feeding center but for 150 sudanese war orphans the 
lifeline is increasingly tenuous 
the children whose parents and relatives were among hundreds of 
thousands of civilian victims of civil war and famine live with 
hundreds of other refugee women children and old men at aweil in 
the embattled bahr elghazal region of southern sudan 
each orphan has a tag attached to an arm or leg showing when he 
or she entered the center and detailing medical care each has been 
given a name a nurse said because everybody has to have a name 
you know 
all the children are members of the predominant southern dinka 
tribe they have nothing outside the feeding centers two crude 
huts and inside they sleep on the earth floor 
they have food cookies highprotien gruel and milk provided by 
the roman catholic charity sudanaid and most are in relatively 
good health 
considering the limited expectations of aweils children that 
makes the orphans of the feeding center luckier than many of their 
famished and impoverished fellows at least for now 
the rev akili malweth the local catholic bishop said the 
centers food was being exhausted rapidly and after that we will 
be at the mercy of the train 
his reference was to a relief train that had been waiting for six 
months in muglad 160 miles away to bring 1500 tons of grain 
caretakers like bishop malweth try to maintain a semblance of 
normality for the children of aweils camps but it is difficult 
alino kolong the towns education commissioner said fewer 
children were attending school 
not all families can afford to buy school materials and many 
of the children here are orphans he said 
a notebook costs 25 sudanese pounds about 2 and a pencil 10 
pounds or 85 cents there is little work for the refugees and none 
that pays more than 5 pounds a day 
many pupils also stay away from school because some of the 
families cannot afford to buy clothes for their children kolong 
said and we cant leave a naked child in the classroom with the 
others 
aweil has a hospital and a doctor the hospital has only 75 beds 
in a capacity of 150 and often is virtually empty because many 
dinka people prefer witch doctors 
sometimes a child is brought here and we hospitalize it dr 
samuel deng said after 10 to 12 hours we discover that the child 
has vanished taken to a traditional healer by its mother 
most of those children die he said

long before he met oliver hardy stan laurel made 
people laugh all by himself 
he was the disasterprone stagestruck lancashire boy born 
stanley jefferson who set the stage on fire on the opening night of 
a home theater 
the first time he performed in a real theater he squashed his 
fathers top hat then ripped his best frock coat for an encore 
those were the little mishaps on the road to hollywood where 
stanley jefferson in 1918 became stan laurel star of 75 movies on 
his own and costar with oliver hardy 105 more 
for laurels 100th birthday on june 16 however all roads lead 
to 3 argyle st in ulverston the northern town where stanley 
jefferson was born 
the attractions include the birthplace the balcony in coronation 
hall where laurel and hardy greeted townspeople in 1947 the laurel 
and hardy museum and the companionship of the sons of the desert 
members of the international laurel and hardy fan club 
and what will they learn of their hero 
a difficult one that said bill cubin curator of the laurel 
and hardy museum i dont think the surroundings could tell you 
anything about stan his grandfather and grandmother were simple 
ulverstonian people 
letters written by laurel and now in the museums collection 
reflect happy memories of fishing in the canal rolling easter eggs 
or shopping with grandma metcalfe that was a big event for me 
laurel recalled in one letter she used to buy me beers treacle 
toffee it sure was good 
the day after the birthday a plaque will be dedicated at a more 
significant spot north shields near the mouth of the river tyne 
and clear across the country from ulverston 
in the attic of the family home in north shields aj jefferson 
built a theater for plays written produced directed and starring 
his 9yearold son stanley 
john mccabe an american actor and author of the comedy world 
of stan laurel found much of the story of laurels early days in 
an article written in 1939 by the father a smalltime impresario 
who operated theaters here and there in britain 
as the senior jefferson told the tale stanley cast himself as 
the hero in the first of the attic productions and recruited for the 
villain a boy named harold whose principal asset was a bulldog sort 
of face and temperment 
on opening night the boys played a fight scene so intensely that 
a lamp was knocked over and both boys were burned one imagines poor 
harold spluttering this is a fine mess 
harold apparently wrote to stanley about his disenchantment and 
its unlikely that he was appeased by this reply 
the fire was all your fault if you had let go of my throat 
when you saw my face going all red we shouldnt have rolled over as 
far as the lamps you have lost nothing over the accident i have 
lost my theater i am sorry about your eyebrows being burned 
off of course but they will grow again 
the house is no longer standing cubin said but laurel devotees 
can travel north to see the derelict pickards theater in glasgow 
scotland where 16yearold stanley jefferson made his professional 
debut 
he was then working for his father at the metropole theater on 
the business side but he fibbed to his father about wanting to 
attend a party and sneaked off to appear at pickards 
aj jefferson was out strolling that night wandered into 
pickards and was surprised to find several pieces of his clothing 
there and his son performing in them stanley didnt notice his 
father until he was taking his bows and aj recalled the scene 
giving a subdued yell of horrified astonishment he dropped my 
topper which thereupon rolled toward the footlights stan pursued 
it tried to grab it and in so doing kicked it accidentally into the 
orchestra where one of the musicians made a rush to retrieve it and 
stepped on it squashing it thoroughly 
then stan made a dash for the exit but his luck was out as he 
ran off he came in contact with a steel hook fixed in the wings for 
a trapeze act and the hook ripped off half the skirt of my beautiful 
frock coat exit loud applause 
stanley came back for more playing the vaudeville circuit and 
his big break came with fred karnos comedy troupe 
soon after young jefferson joined the troupe they were 
rehearsing a show called jimmy the fearless in london the 
troupes star charlie chaplin decided the show wouldnt work and 
refused to appear so jefferson got the part 
the show was a hit and within a week chaplin consented to star 
but jefferson stayed on as chaplins understudy and second banana 
one of the treasures of the museum in ulverston is a poster 
advertising the karnos troupes appearance at the william morris 
american music hall in new york in 1911 jefferson and chaplin had 
star billing 
in 1912 the troupe returned to america where chaplin resigned to 
make movies for mack sennett stanley jefferson became the principal 
comedian but the troupe folded a short time later in philadelphia 
stanley jefferson decided to stay in 1917 he signed a contract 
with universal studios and that same year appeared in a short film 
titled lucky dog with oliver hardy 
it wasnt until 1926 however that they became a team in 45 
minutes from hollywood it was the birth of one of the greatest 
comedy teams in film history the reedy hairscratching laurel 
with his childish innocence and mischief and the tubby tietwirling 
hardy whose cherubic face belied a short temper when his partner got 
them into another fine mess 
laurel died in 1965 hardy whose 100th birthday is in 1992 died 
in 1957 
laurels solo films were highlighted this month in programs in 
london and new york 
the national film theater in london has already screened just 
rambling along somewhere in wrong dr pyckle and mr 
pride and when knights were cold 
another program at the national film theater illustrated how 
laurels comedy ideas were recycled in laurel and hardy films 
smithy a laurel solo in 1924 about a man who is mistaken for a 
building contractor and builds a collapsible house became laurel 
and hardys the finishing touch four years later 
the national film theater had advertised a first showing of a 
recently discovered laurel and hardy film it would be no 106 
but it is still not ready for showing a theater spokeswoman said 
on the birthday the american museum of the moving image in new 
york will show five short silents made by laurel before hardy 
pick and shovel collars and cuffs west of hot dog 
on the front page and eves love letters

frogs toads and salamanders are vanishing around 
the world in a trend biologists say appears linked to the planets 
deteriorating environment 
from the united states to india to japan and australia 
scientists report whole amphibian populations have disappeared or 
are declining even in protected reserves 
there is no consistent pattern says university of miami 
biologist marc hayes there doesnt seem to be any obvious global 
cause except that almost all seem to be manmade 
hayes who heads the new national committee on declining 
amphibians says humans should worry not only because of the loss of 
animal species but because amphibians highly sensitive biology 
make them the canary in the coal mine an environmental early 
warning system 
amphibians including frogs toads and salamanders were the 
first land vertebrates they appeared 400 million years ago long 
before dinosaurs and about 200 million years ago evolved into 
species similar to presentday varieties 
that longevity now seems imperiled studies presented at an 
international conference in february documented a sharp drop 
worldwide in amphibian populations 
leopard frogs are no longer sighted in canada the common 
european toad has disappeared from regions in norway three species 
of miniature frogs vanished from puerto rico salamander populations 
are shrinking in the western united states and japan reports 
several frog species are in decline 
a recently discovered australian frog that fascinated biologists 
because it hatched its young in its stomach apparently went extinct 
in only one season the monte verde nature reserve in costa rica 
reports all of its amphibian populations have declined and the 
golden toad that once carpeted its forests may be extinct 
some causes of the phemomenon are known and vary from country to 
country but cases such as the loss of frogs in australia or us 
preserves leave biologists puzzled 
in some of the areas that are the most protected frogs are 
disappearing and we have no explanation for it hayes says 
there are a whole suite of species that have disappeared from very 
wide ranges in the united states 
david wake a university of california at berkeley zoologist who 
chaired the conference in february says acid raid could be one of 
the culprits killing off salamanders in the colorado rockies 
hayes says ultraviolet light is a known threat to frogs eggs 
and increased amounts of the harmful radiation entering through the 
thinning ozone layer could be destructive another hazard for frogs 
is stocking ponds with bass and other predator fish especially in 
areas where the animals evolved with no such enemies and have no 
ability to escape them 
in the everglades hayes notes pig frogs were hunted for food 
almost to extinction in the 1930s and have never fully recovered 
that pattern is being repeated in india and indonesia the monte 
verde disappearance could be due to changing weather patterns caused 
by global warming he says or because frogs need many 
interconnected habitats and become isolated by roads and other 
development 
wake says amphibians which absorb large amounts of water through 
their skins are highly susceptible to heavy metals and other toxic 
material often exhuasted into the air and water 
add widespread pesticide use logging dams habitat destruction 
and other local factors and the amphibian population is in trouble 
they are bioindicators wake warns it may not be 
something that will hurt us directly but they are telling us about 
the loss of resiliance of our ecosystem the loss of diversity 
the loss of amphibians also has some immediate noticeable effects 
on man the scientists say 
the poison dart frog has a toxin in its skin that when refined 
has been used successfully on an experimental basis for treating 
heart conditions says hayes in addition frogs are a source of 
food in many parts of the world 
wake says amphibians also are a key part of natures ecological 
balance 
frog tadpoles consume an enormous about of algae says wake 
they keep our streams flowing clear and clean 
as adults frogs move onto land and become the top local 
predators consuming enormous amounts of small insects including 
mosquitoes 
the demise of pig frogs in the everglades could have a bearing on 
the unexplained drop in wading birds which have decreased by up to 
90 percent since the beginning of the century says hayes 
the variety of explanations and theories makes it clear there is 
no panacea to solve the problem says wake 
and he adds that no government agency is working on the problem 
in any case he has been in contact with several us senators on a 
project to create a national institute for the environment to 
protect the nations biological wealth but says so far the 
amphibian problem in the united states is in the hands of 
overworked underfunded state game commissions 
until there is more attention biologists can only watch the 
disappearance of amphibian species with alarm 
when the canary died the miner left says wake now the 
canary is dying but weve got to sit here where are we going to 
go

heinrich schliemann the 19thcentury 
german archaeologist credited with discovering the legendary city of 
troy has come under fresh attack a century after his death 
more than 200 archaeologists historians and classicists gathered 
in athens to mark schliemanns death and debate the legacy of the 
man considered the father of prehistoric greek archaeology 
schliemann a grocers son who became a millionaire is famous 
for excavating the ancient cities of troy and mycenae and finding 
bronze age civilizations at the sites whose existence previously was 
unknown 
but some experts have doubted schliemanns integrity and the 
reliability of the historical data he left his successors 
my findings seem to show that schliemann was a pathological 
liar david a taill a classics professor at the university of 
california at davis said in an interview 
controversy has surrounded schliemanns findings since their 
publication in 1874 his methods primitive by todays standards 
have often been criticized 
still many historians regard him as a pioneer in archaeological 
discovery and say purported inaccuracies may be due to hasty 
documentation 
taill who spoke at the conference held last month spent 10 
years scouring records of schliemanns excavations as well as his 
diaries and letters 
the professor said the value of an archaeological find depended 
on knowing where particular pieces were discovered placement often 
indicates age 
once it has been established schliemann falsified some of his 
finds the question is how great is the damage he said 
the implications of any faking could be great for example his 
data on the existence of settlements and the position of objects at 
troy have helped to determine the age of ruins throughout the 
anatolia region in turkey troy is in modernday hissarlik turkey 
taill and others have challenged schliemanns most dramatic 
discovery a gold hoard he said was the treasure of legendary king 
priam 
im fairly convinced he found some of the items separately and 
put them together for a big bang at the end taill said taill 
claimed that schliemann in different accounts changed his 
description of where he found priams treasure 
schliemanns account of finding the treasure with his wife 
sophia was false because letters showed she was in athens at the 
time taill said 
taills research added new fuel to a debate that has raged for 
years schliemanns excavating techniques have long been debated 
with some people saying he destroyed valuable data by working too 
quickly 
another expert edmund f bloedow professor of ancient history 
at ottawa university told conference delegates that differences in 
schliemanns accounts could be attributed to the inevitable haste 
in making initial notes and sketches and transcribing them 
professor manfred korfmann of tubingen university in west germany 
said schliemann may have enlarged the king priam trove with items he 
bought but korfmann who is excavating at troy nonetheless 
emphasized schliemanns pioneering of archaeological techniques 
questions about king priams hoard may never be resolved 
schliemann said he found the gold silver and bronze trove in 1873 
he gave it to germany and during world war ii it was stored in a 
berlin vault it later vanished 
schliemann is esteemed for using archaeology as a means to 
reconstruct historical periods 
before him archaeologists generally dug to find sculptures to 
enrich private and museum collections schliemanns attention to 
small finds at different levels of the earth resulted in a more 
accurate method of determining chronologies 
with the publication of schliemanns first reports on troy 
archaeology and prehistoric field archaeology in particular began 
to move ahead toward something entirely new korfmann told the 
delegates 
taill to underline his contention that schliemanns integrity 
was dubious listed examples of how the archaeologist had allegedly 
lied in his personal life 
he claimed that schliemann gained us citizenship in 1869 by 
lying about the length of his stay in the country 
schliemann also apparently falsified his diary taill said a 
june 1851 entry gives his graphic eyewitness account of a major 
fire in san francisco however the fire was in may when schliemann 
was in sacramento taill said 
why would he lie in his own diary he asked 
despite attacks on schliemanns credibility scholars admired his 
skills 
schliemann who died dec 26 1890 at 68 immersed himself in 
the poet homer schliemann said he found troy by following homers 
descriptions of its location 
however historians point out that hissarlik had already been 
suggested as the likely site of prehistoric troy

a breast implant filled with peanut oil could 
mean safer breast enlargements for thousands of women who have the 
surgery each year a radiologist says 
because the oil is transparent the new implants do not interfere 
with xray mammography for breast cancer the way silicone breast 
implants can said judy destouet head of the mammography unit at 
washington universitys mallinckrodt institute of radiology 
they appear like the fat in the breast you can see through 
it destouet said 
destouet and leroy young associate professor of plastic and 
reconstructive surgery at washington university school of medicine 
are heading the development of the new implant 
the most common implant now is filled with silicone gel which 
appears as dense as bone in xrays and therefore can hamper early 
detection of breast cancer destouet said others are filled with 
saline or a combination of silicone and saline 
i think many women need breast augmentation for self esteem 
and i think that we should have the freedom to do what we want for 
our bodies destouet said 
we hoped to develop a better product that would allow women to 
augment their breasts but wont take away the benefits of 
stateoftheart mammography we feel that we have something that 
really can be a safe alternative 
breast augmentation is one of the most popular cosmetic surgery 
procedures available according to the american society of plastic 
and reconstructive surgeons inc in arlington heights ill some 
72000 women undergo breast augmentation each year said spokeswoman 
cathleen coyne 
but some doctors disagree that implants interfere with early 
cancer detection 
studies by dr garry brody at the university of southern 
california followed 3000 women in the los angeles area who have had 
breast augmentation 
thus far the delay is theoretic only its certainly a 
possibility but when we look at the statistics we cant find the 
delay their cancer seems to be picked up at the same stage as the 
unaugmented population 
the american cancer society estimates that one in 10 women will 
develop breast cancer in her lifetime 
carolyn cline a plastic surgeon and psychologist in san 
francisco said she discourages women with a family history of 
breast cancer from having the surgery but the average women i 
dont feel given the improvements in radiological techniques 
that it is a major issue she said 
the washington university researchers have spent the last year or 
so conducting tests on rats and rabbits to make sure their implants 
have no adverse effects such as allergic reactions or extreme scar 
tissue formation 
so far our animal studies are very favorable destouet said 
there really are no side effects 
once the researchers get us food and drug administration 
approval the implants will be tested in women they could be 
available commercially in about two years 
destouet said the researchers came upon peanut oil as a safe 
implant filler when they turned to their chemistry books to find 
which substances would allow xray penetration and which of those 
substances were not carcinogenic 
the implants still use a thin silicone shell to hold the peanut 
oil 
we need a better envelope too destouet said you cant 
invent everything at the same time

scientists discovered how deadly legionnaires 
disease bacteria can survive in chlorinated water especially hot 
water tanks in hospitals and other large buildings the microbes 
hide inside amoebas 
anywhere you have water that is tepid you may have a 
problem said john kuchta chief microbiologist for the city water 
department in pittsburgh 
the problem is unlikely in residential hot water tanks which 
usually are heated from the bottom where heat kills the 
sedimentdwelling microorganisms known as amoebas kuchta said 
recently during the american society for microbiologys annual 
meeting in anaheim 
but kuchta and fellow microbiologist jeannine navratil found both 
the diseasecausing legionella pneumophila bacteria and the amoebas 
that hide them when they examined hot water reservoirs at hospitals 
and universities those recirculatingwater tanks werent heated 
from the bottom but from the sides 
kuchta said the problem can be solved by superchlorinating water 
for short periods of time and by increasing water temperature to 150 
degrees fahrenheit which he acknowledged contradicts efforts to 
conserve energy and prevent scalding burns 
legionnaires disease was named after it killed 34 guests staying 
at the bellevuestratford hotel in philadelphia during a state 
american legion convention in 1976 an additional 221 people became 
ill the disease subsequently was recognized as a leading cause of 
pneumonia among hospital patients 
it is believed to be spread by inhalation of contaminated water 
vapor such as from tainted air conditioning units or in a recent 
case from mist sprayed on produce in a grocery store the disease 
apparently isnt transmitted from one person to another 
scientists already knew legionnaires bacteria could multiply 
only after they are engulfed by amoebas members of a group of 
singlecelled organisms called protozoa 
in laboratory studies the pittsburgh scientists found the same 
process allows the bacteria to survive chlorination 10 times 
stronger than is generally accepted as safe for disinfection of 
drinking water 
in addition to being physically sheltered from chlorine 
legionnaires bacteria also undergo biochemical changes when growing 
inside amoebas making the bacteria even more resistant to 
chlorination 
it may be difficult if not impossible to completely prevent 
legionellae legionnaires and related bacteria and perhaps other 
protozoanborne pathogens from colonizing potable water tanks 
which can be disinfected only by superchlorination or high 
temperatures the scientists wrote 
kuchta said he is mainly concerned about hospitals where hot 
water often is 130 degrees or less for fear of scalding patients 
the bottom line is to make sure it is 150 degrees at least for a 
time he said

lawmakers are threatening to block exports of 
us high technology to the soviet union until it ends its economic 
blockade of lithuania 
by a 39024 vote wednesday the house voted to bar the sale of 
us computers and telecommunications gear needed to modernize the 
soviet economy until moscow begins negotiating lithuanias 
independence without economic coercion 
on a voice vote the house also agreed to ban hightech sales to 
the soviet union if it continues to restrict jewish emigration 
while the soviet president put out one hand in requesting aid 
from the united states the other hand is wrapped tightly around the 
neck of lithuania said rep william broomfield of michigan the 
senior republican on the house foreign affairs committee 
rep mel levine dcalif who sought the jewish emigration 
provision said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had played 
into the hands of arab extremists in remarks at a news conference 
ending last weeks superpower summit 
gorbachev said he was under pressure from egypt and syria to 
start denying exit visas to soviet jews if israel continues to allow 
them settle in israelioccupied territories on the west bank 
meanwhile wednesday the united states and the soviet union 
signed another agreement on sharing foodprocessing information 
particularly how us technology and methods can be incorporated by 
the soviets 
and yuri n chumakov the deputy soviet minister of foreign 
economic relations told a gathering of us businessmen that his 
country will be looking for us loans under a new tentative trade 
agreement 
the united states is our greatest food supplier and we have 
been paying with cash chumakov said we have the right to 
expect in this hard period to receive certain credits in order to 
withstand the pressure 
the house votes on amendments to an administrationopposed bill 
easing controls on hightech us exports was the first 
congressional reaction to the trade accord signed by bush and 
gorbachev last friday 
moscow is particularly interested in acquiring us 
telecommunications and computer technology during last weeks 
summit for example the soviets signed an agreement with 
international business machines corp to buy school computers 
the bushgorbachev agreement would lower 40yearold trade 
barriers between the two countries but only upon the supreme 
soviets approval of a law to make it easier for soviet citizens to 
emigrate to or visit the west 
however many members of congress want to condition any change in 
trade relations with moscow to its treatment of lithuania and other 
breakaway movements within the faltering soviet empire 
since april 18 the soviets have cut off supplies of oil natural 
gas other raw materials and medical supplies to lithuania in 
response to its declaration of independence a month earlier 
although the soviet union is moving toward peace and openness 
it is not quite there said rep richard durbin dill the 
author of the measure to forbid hightech sales to moscow the 
iron curtain is still present when it comes to lithuania and other 
baltic countries 
through other amendments house members also expressed 
dissatisfaction with bushs decision last month to extend most 
favored nation trade status to china despite the governments 
violent reaction to the tiananmen square uprising a year ago 
on a 39315 vote the house approved an amendment by rep gerald 
solomon rny that would forbid bush from approving any more 
exports of usbuilt or usowned satellites to china the 
amendment would not affect the export of three such satellites 
approved last december by bush 
all of the votes were on amendments to a bill reauthorizing us 
participation in the 17nation coordinating committee for 
multilateral security controls which determines which western 
hightech goods are too militarily sensitive to be sold to potential 
enemies 
the overall bill passed 31286 despite administration veto 
threats similar legislation is pending in the senate banking 
committee 
the thrust of the bill is that business is more important than 
national security said rep henry hyde rill there are 
military and intelligence aspects to some of these 
telecommunications exports were crazy to hand that stuff to the 
soviet union 
supporters however maintained that cold warrior attitudes 
should no longer dominate us export policies 
rep ed markey dmass said we should accept our victory 
eastern europeans are going to spend upwards of 140 billion in the 
next decade on telecommunications and we should get a chunk of it 
rep bill frenzel rminn cited a study by the national academy 
of sciences estimating that the existing controls denied us 
companies 92 billion in exports in 1987 with no perceptible 
increase in national security 
the bill basically eases export controls on telecommunications 
equipment computers and machine tools to the newly democratizing 
countries of eastern europe and to a lesser extent the soviets 
us manufacturers have repeatedly complained that the us 
export controls are effectively shutting out their participation in 
eastern europes developing economy while japan west germany and 
south korea establish toeholds in it

frank lorenzo acknowledging that he controls only 
one airline today said his texas air corp would change its name to 
continental airlines holdings inc 
although texas air technically still owns eastern airlines as 
well as continental a bankruptcy judge in april ordered lorenzo out 
of the eastern cockpit and appointed a trustee to run the 
strikebound airline 
the name change was made to reflect the fact that the principal 
business of the company is continental lorenzo told shareholders 
at the companys annual meeting wednesday the change takes effect 
monday 
he told reporters later that the change doesnt mean texas air 
has given up completely on eastern but he declined to comment when 
asked whether he believed he would regain control of the carrier 
the atmosphere at the shareholder meeting was a stark contrast to 
the gathering last september when eastern was seven months into a 
bitter labor dispute with its striking unions 
then about 100 eastern strikers picketed outside and chanted 
antilorenzo slogans while those attending the meeting had to pass 
through metal detectors 
the protestors and detectors were absent this year and even 
lorenzo couldnt resist mentioning that the quiet crowd of more than 
200 was unusual for a texas air shareholders meeting 
lorenzo admitted that the eastern airlines situation has been 
very difficult for us 
on april 18 us bankruptcy judge burton lifland acted at the 
request of easterns creditors and turned control of the airline 
over to trustee martin shugrue a former continental boss and 
lorenzo associate the move had been sought by the airlines unions 
since the strike began 
we dont believe that a trustee was warranted lorenzo said 
but he said he remains concerned about the future of eastern

argentina has made a 40 million 
payment to foreign creditors the first since foreign debt payments 
were suspended more than two years ago government officials said 
thursday 
carlos carballo undersecretary of economy confirmed that 
payments had been renewed following arduous discussions in new 
york between central bank vice president javier gonzalez fraga and 
individual creditor banks

good will aimed at aiding gonzalez fraga in talks scheduled to 
began this week with a consortium of private creditors 
argentina the developing worlds third largest debtor owes a 
total of 60 billion in loans plus unpaid interest that could reach 
85 billion by the end of the year 
ministry sources said the government hopes to negotiate an 
agreement to pay 300 million in overdue interest by the end of the 
year the creditors reportedly have sought payment of 500 million 
in the event negotiators reach agreement argentina would make 
another interest payment of between 70 million and 80 million 
ministry sources said 
the 11monthold government of president carlos menem is seeking 
debt forgiveness approval for debt capitalization and new loans 
negotiations with a steering committee that represents private 
banks which are owed a total of 40 billion are likely to be 
difficult citibank for example reportedly has written off 40

carballo said 240 million of the unblocked funds have already 
entered the country and that a new installment of the same amount 
would be disbursed by early august 
argentina is emerging from two bouts of hyperinflation and is 
mired in recession inflation which hit 96 percent in march

with dozens of hollywood stars joining steven spielberg to ride 
the movies at universal studios florida 
the combination theme park and film production center features 
hightech entertainment on a big scale showing visitors how movies 
are made while letting them in on the action 
james stewart charlton heston bill cosby and michael j fox 
were among the 50 or so top names parading down a replica of 
hollywood boulevard in limousines to open the festivities 
sidney sheinberg president of the parks coowner mca inc 
today called the 444acre site a swampland turned into a 
dreamland 
but the park wasnt totally up and running technical glitches 
prevented some of the major rides from operating at a special party 
for some 4500 delegates to a travel industry convention wednesday 
night 
sheinberg and studio technical officials said most everything 
would be in operation today but that problems and delays were 
expected because of the complexity of the equipment 
the park owned by californiabased mca and londons rank 
organisation plc features classic moviethemed rides and 
participatory adventures many of which were conceived and 
designed by film director spielberg universals creative consultant 
visitors go soaring with et the extraterrestrial survive the 
1906 san francisco earthquake agonize over an encounter with the 
great white shark from jaws get buffetted in an aerial tramway 
by a 3storytall king kong and lose themselves in the liveaction 
ghostbusters haunting 
universal also has the largest movie and tv sound stage area 
outside hollywood calif production has been under way since 1988 
and 13 feature films and 500 television episodes are to go before 
the cameras this year 
universal is also the new home to nickelodeon the childrens 
television network and the first hard rock cafe in florida 
mca is trying to grab a share of floridas booming themepark 
industry a business dominated by entertainment giant walt disney 
world 
the disneymgm studios based on the same concept but about half 
the size of universal studios completed its first year of operation 
may 1 it recorded about 8 million visits in its first year but the 
turnstile count inflates actual attendance 
universal has a daily capacity of more than 40000 and expects to 
draw at least 5 million visitors its first year 
mca vice president jay stein who headed designing and building 
of the florida park said he was confident of its success in the 
face of the formidable competition a few miles down the interstate 
its a mustsee attraction i dont think were going to 
eclipse disney overnight but we are going to bring lots of new 
business to the area and lots of repeat business to the area he 
said 
stein a toughtalking taskmaster who started in the mailroom at 
mca 30 years ago and his boss sheinberg have had a running feud 
with disney chairman michael eisner for years 
they claim eisner copied their idea for a movietheme park and 
rushed to build the disneymgm studios before universal could get 
its act together eisner and other disney executives downplay any 
talk of a rivalry and instead tout the benefits of competition 
universal studios florida is also an important test of whether 
mca and rank can export the same concept to europe and japan 
we think theres a terrific market out there for hightech 
theme parks stein says 
an announcement is expected soon on a similar enterprise to be 
built either near london or paris mca also has announced plans for 
a theme park in japan in partnership with nippon steel

donald trumps top executive in this 
casino city today flatly denied the new york developer planned to 
sell any of his gaming halls in the wake of reports of cash flow 
problems 
let me tell you today there is no for sale sign on the trump 
properties said ed tracy president of trumps three casino 
complexes and luxury hotel here the properties are not for sale 
not trump plaza trump castle or taj mahal 
trump also operates the trump regency formerly the atlantis 
casino hotel as a hotel only 
tracy told a crowded news conference that the taj mahal casino 
hotel the 1 billion complex that opened with much fanfare in 
april will reduce its workforce of 7200 by about 10 percent 
but he cautioned that layoffs were routine following the opening 
of a new gaming hall and the boardwalk complex would probably have 
from 6000 to 6200 workers when it completes what is known in the 
industry as its shakedown period 
theres nothing new about this tracy said noting that 
trump plaza cut its workforce by 12 percent when it opened in 1985 
under harrahs management 
tracy refused to discuss any legal action involving trump 
himself bondholders for trump plaza and trump castle have sued the 
manhattan developer in us district court contending his promotion 
of the taj mahal has weakened the values of their bonds in the other 
gaming halls 
tracy also rejected rumors that the properties are for sale 
because bankers are pressuring trump to cut back costs and because 
the bonds used to finance the casinos are plummeting

us businesses plan to boost plant and 
equipment investment in 1990 at the slowest rate in three years the 
government said thursday the report reflected a sluggish economy 
and weak product demand 
the commerce department said a survey completed in may found 
businesses planning to boost spending on expansion and modernization 
by 55 percent to 5004 billion it would be the fourth consecutive 
yearly increase 
but while the spending projection would top the record 4743 
billion set last year the rate of increase would be the slowest 
since a 42 percent gain in 1987 investments rose 89 percent last 
year and 94 percent in 1988 
it shows the manufacturing sector is responding negatively to 
the sluggishness in that area said robert g dederick chief 
economist for the northern trust co in chicago 
all one is looking for here is that it not be a drag on the 
economy he added if it were a drag it would be a heavy burden 
on the economy given the other negatives such as defense spending 
and housing 
manufacturing and housing have been the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit by the federal reserves tightmoney policy also the 
federal government has cut back on military spending because of 
budget constraints 
the new estimate is down from the 79 percent spending increase 
in a previous survey completed in march a survey completed in 
november indicated a 49 percent investment gain this year 
all of the figures have been adjusted for inflation 
lawrence chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa group in 
bala cynwyd pa said three factors were dampening investment plans 
a soft economy and subsequent sluggish demand weak profits and 
cash flows and high interest rates and tighter restrictions on 
credit 
the only thing keeping capital spending going now is the fact a 
lot of companies realize if they dont modernize and improve 
productivity and improve the quality of their products theyll be 
out of business eventually he said 
replacing aging plants and equipment and expanding facilities 
helps to boost us productivity an increasingly important factor 
in view of the stiff competition american companies face from 
overseas 
the labor department reported monday that american worker 
productivity had plunged at a 27 percent annual rate so far this 
year the poorest showing since the 198182 recession 
any growth in business spending would help stimulate the economy 
now in its eighth year of expansion and pick up some of the slack 
from diminished consumer spending 
before adjusting for inflation the department survey projected a 
67 percent increase for all businesses this year to 5072 billion 
after gains of 104 percent last year and 105 percent in 1988 
it said the investment increase for all industries includes a 34 
percent gain for manufacturing firms and an 87 percent advance for 
companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing activities 
manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of 
1909 billion the anticipated rate of increase is lower than the 
average for all industries and down from the 49 percent projection 
in april 
the manufacturing gain includes a 24 percent hike in durable 
goods bigticket items expected to last at least three years and 
a 43 percent increase in nondurables

grain and soybean futures prices were higher 
thursday in trading on the chicago board of trade 
corn futures led the advance as adverse weather conditions 
continue to influence the market 
there was more rain in the southern midwest crop areas 
increasing the prospects for a smaller than anticipated us corn 
crop this year said susan leighty an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc in new york 
there was talk on the floor that as much as 3 to 5 percent of 
intented corn acreage may not get planted analysts said 
soybean prices were boosted by the strength of corn futures and 
concern about planting delays however the jump in soybean futures 
was limited by speculation that should the southern midwest dry out 
by midjune some of the intended corn acres will be switched to 
soybeans 
corn needs longer to mature than soybeans 
wheat futures gained on concerns the wet weather has lowered the 
quality and quantity of the winter crop and is delaying harvesting 
ms leighty said 
wheat prices also received a boost from word the us agriculture 
department has targeted the soviet union for 2 million metric tons 
of export bonus wheat 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in july at 335 a bushel corn was 4 cents

manuel h johnson unexpectedly announced his 
resignation thursday from the no 2 job at the federal reserve 
creating a key opening at an agency often criticized by the bush 
administration for keeping interest rates too high 
johnson 41 said he planned to return to an academic career 
the aug 3 departure will give president bush the chance to make 
another appointment to the sevenmember board that directs the 
nations monetary policy 
the administration at various times in past months has been 
openly critical of the feds efforts to restrain inflation by 
keeping interest rates high 
there was a published report in march quoting an unnamed bush 
adviser as saying the president was mad as hell with federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and would not reappoint him as 
chairman 
bush later insisted there was no bubbling war with greenspan 
but left the clear impression he would like to see more aggressive 
action on the part of the fed to lower interest rates 
analysts said it was likely that bush would appoint someone to 
the fed who would be more amenable to the administrations pleas for 
lower interest rates 
this administration has been jawboning the fed on and off for 
some time for a looser monetary policy said kenneth guenther of 
the independent bankers association of america they want lower 
interest rates because they dont want the economy moving into a 
recession 
fed officials have been pursuing a softlanding approach for 
the economy in which interest rates are used to slow growth enough 
to ease inflationary pressures but not enough to tip the country 
into a recession 
many analysts believe that approach is working and that the fed 
is unlikely to change course even with a new vice chairman appointed 
by bush 
the fed isnt closely divided now where one vote in either 
direction would make much of a difference said lyle gramley a 
former fed governor and now chief economist of the mortgage bankers 
association 
the white house would not discuss possible successors but deputy 
white house press secretary alixe glen said the administration 
believed johnson had done a terrific job 
bush will may either name someone new to the board and designate 
that person vice chairman or select one of the other governors as 
vice chairman while appointing someone to fill johnsons board term 
which runs until aug 21 2000 
there was speculation that david mullins appointed to the fed 
earlier this year might be considered for the vice chairmans job 
mullins one of the authors of the savings and loan bailout 
legislation had been a top assistant to treasury secretary nicholas 
brady 
others mentioned as possible candidates for appointment were 
wendy gramm head of the commodity futures trading commission and 
wife of sen phil gramm rtexas john taylor a member of the 
presidents council of economic advisers and treasury under 
secretary robert glauber 
the administration is likely to choose someone out of the same 
mold as mullins said david jones author of a book on the federal 
reserve and chief economist at aubrey g lanston amp co he will be 
a proadministration republican with an academic background 
johnson had once been considered a top candidate to become fed 
chairman if the administration chose not to reappoint greenspan next 
year 
johnson said at a news conference that he fully backed the 
reappointment of greenspan and that policy disagreements were not a 
factor in his decision to step down 
while past fed governors have cited the low pay as a reason for 
resigning johnson said his 82500 salary was not a factor in his 
decision 
the main reason i decided to step down is that i have spent 10 
consecutive years in public service he said ten years is long 
enough 
johnson was appointed to the fed by president reagan on feb 7 
1986 and was elevated to vice chairman six months later 
he said his resignation would be effective at the end of his 
fouryear term as vice chairman 
i am extremely proud to have played a part in the unprecedented 
period of sustained economic growth and low inflation that has 
characterized the decade of the 1980s and continues into the 
1990s johnson said in his letter of resignation 
johnson said he planned to return to george mason university in 
washingtons virginia suburbs and assume the koch chair in 
international economics and become director of the center for global 
market studies 
he was a professor at the school in 1981 when he was selected to 
join the economics team assembled by thentreasury secretary donald 
regan in reagans first term 
i deeply regret but understand manley johnsons decision 
greenspan said in a statement the vice chairman and i have been 
an effective team ill miss him 
the fed the nations central bank headquartered in washington 
is run by the board of governors and a nationwide network of 12 
district banks the governors are appointed by the president and 
confirmed by the senate to serve 14year terms

keeping iacocca 65 appears to be a stopgap move inspired by 
last weeks resignation of vice chairman gerald greenwald iacoccas 
handpicked successor 
he has just said that until he and the board determine together 
that the company can continue to be equally effective without his 
personal daytoday involvement he will stay around liebler said 
one other thing is to put a succession plan in place he 
added 
a year ago iacocca told greenwald that the chairmanship was 
yours to lose but on may 31 it was announced greenwald had 
resigned to spearhead a threeunion bid to buy united airlines for 
454 billion 
iacocca who loves the limelight has waffled recently on whether 
he would step down as chairman in december 1991 when his contract 
expires 
unlike other auto company chairmen iacocca regularly appears in 
television commercials and in print advertising unabashedly touting 
chrysler and the united states 
he has written two books iacocca an autobiography of which 
millions of copies were sold and talking straight he once made 
a guest appearance on the television show miami vice and 
markets wine produced at his italian estate 
even if greenwald had taken over as chairman iacocca had been 
expected to remain on the companys board of directors and play a 
large role in the companys future some analysts speculated that 
iacoccas continued presence might be one reason greenwald quit 
less than 24 hours after greenwalds resignation chrysler 
announced that robert s miller the companys chief financial 
officer would take over greenwalds title and most of his duties 
chrysler motors president robert lutz got the rest of the duties 
but no new title 
the changes prompted immediate speculation that iacocca might 
seek a new contract after 1991 since neither miller 48 nor lutz 
58 appeared ready to become chairman in 18 months 
the extension of iacoccas tenure as chairman buys time for 
chrysler to groom one of them or find another heir for iacocca 
greenwald was the highestranking of three executives who 
announced in may they would quit chrysler michael hammes resigned 
as vice president for international operations to head up hand tool 
operations at black amp decker corp the towson mdbased household 
products manufacturer and treasurer frederick zuckerman said he 
will quit sometime this summer 
the drain on chryslers executive force began last october when 
the company started a 15 billion costcutting program that will 
result in a whitecollar work force reduction of more than 2500 
people 
chrysler reported its firstquarter earnings were down 80 percent 
from last year to 71 million and analysts have predicted there 
wont be any upturn until at least the fourth quarter 
chryslers sales also have taken a dive through the first five 
months of this year chryslers car and truck sales were down nearly 
13 percent compared with last year 
iacocca signed a fouryear contract with the automaker in 1987 
he joined chrysler in 1979 after being fired as president of ford 
motor co by the late henry ford ii 
iacoccas most lucrative year as chairman was in 1986 when he 
received 205 million in compensation his average annual 
compensation since 1985 was 115 million he received 4 million 
for last year 
the companys 1990 proxy statement says iacocca will receive 
191250 shares of chrysler stock this coming nov 2 and another 
63750 shares after dec 8 1991 at recent prices the stock would 
have a combined value of 41 million 
iacoccas colossal compensation wasnt the only thing that put 
the son of italian immigrants into the news during the last decade 
his name has popped up occasionally as a potential democratic 
presidential candidate and he made news when he collided with the 
reagan administration over funding for the statue of liberty 
restoration 
he is engaged to be married for a third time after a stormy 
divorce that ended an 18month marriage to his second wife peggy 
johnson 
mary iacocca his first wife of 26 years died in 1983

trans world airlines chairman carl icahn has 
disclosed plans to sell 20 boeing 727s in what union officials 
called another scare tactic in his bid to gain concessions from 
pilots 
icahn has promised to modernize twas fleet if pilots take 10 
percent pay cuts and agree to other concessions that would save 80 
million a year he has threatened to shrink or dismantle the 
troubled carrier if they refuse 
kent scott chairman of the twa branch of the air line pilots 
association said wednesday that icahn may only be trying to get rid 
of the old relatively inefficient jets to make room for more modern 
ones such as europeanmade airbuses 
of course he wouldnt let us in on that scott said hed 
make it look like a liquidation to put more pressure on us 
thomas albrecht an analyst for ag edwards said he also 
doubted that the sale of the planes was the beginning of a 
dismantling of the airline he said icahn would probably make no 
drastic changes as long as he still saw a chance of selling the 
entire airline to employees or an outside buyer 
ive got to believe that if he was going to shrink the airline 
he wouldnt be doing it now albrecht said he still wants to 
keep it attractive 
the plan to sell the jets was disclosed this week when icahn sent 
out solicitations for bids to avmark an airline marketing and 
consulting company 
the current plan is different from earlier sales analysts say 
twa has sold 21 other jets since december in deals that generated 
about 580 million in proceeds all but two of those jets were 
leased back to the airline however 
the current sale of jets is apparently an attempt to eliminate 
the 727s from the carriers 210jet fleet 
it does not look like a saleleaseback type of arrangement 
said paul turk an analyst for avmark 
twa and other airlines have been selling and leasing back jets to 
capitalize on a strong market for used aircraft used 727s of the 
type that twa is selling have been bringing anywhere from 65 
million to 12 million turk said 
twa could replace the 727s by leasing or buying some of the 100 
airbus a320s once destined for braniff inc which went bankrupt 
last fall

a federal bankruptcy judge thursday 
authorized greyhound lines inc to pay salaries and operating 
expenses after union attorneys made sure the strikebound bus 
companys executives would not receive golden parachute bonuses 
a top greyhound executive said after thursdays hearing that 
illegal strikerelated violence forced the company to file 
monday for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection 
at the hearing us bankruptcy judge richard s schmidt ordered 
the us trustees office to start setting up a single committee of 
unsecured creditors he set the next hearing for june 28 in mcallen 
dallasbased greyhound the nations largest bus transportation 
company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection monday to keep 
buses operating through the peak summer travel season 
the company has been hurt financially since a walkout three 
months ago by its 6300 bus drivers 
we have been given the ability to use cash to continue to 
operate our business in the ordinary course george w hanthorn 
vice president and general counsel for greyhound said after the 
hearing 
he said the judges order on operating expenses and an order 
monday allowing prebankruptcy tickets to be honored would keep the 
buses rolling greyhound will have about 3800 buses on the road at 
any given time he said 
our customers will not see any change in the business as we 
have been operating hanthorn told reporters 
hanthorn blamed strikerelated violence for the bankruptcy filing 
greyhound has spent literally millions of dollars in legal 
fees excess security costs etcetera to try to combat the illegal 
violence that we face during the strike and i attribute it exactly 
to that he said 
smith williamson secretarytreasurer of the amalgamated council 
of greyhound locals rejected hanthorns contention 
theres been a comedy of errors by greyhound chairman fred 
currey he figured the strike would be over in three days and it 
didnt work williamson said thursday 
currey has to manufacture some reason why hes in this position 
now so hes laying the blame at the feet of the union 
since the strike began there have been dozens of incidents of 
shooting and rockthrowing at buses early in the strike a picketer 
was crushed by a bus in california 
attorneys for greyhound and the amalgamated council of greyhound 
locals spent part of thursday morning negotiating how greyhound 
intended to pay 25 million in salaries and up to 27 million in 
other employee vacation medical and workers compensation benefits 
the main sticking point was the 25 million in prebankruptcy 
wages and salaries including paychecks issued but not yet cashed 
negotiators agreed to limit prefiling wage payments to 2000 per 
employee 
i just didnt want any golden parachutes adopted that would be 
weighted in favor of greyhound executives and against the wage 
earner said union attorney shelby jordan golden parachutes are 
contract provisions that grant severance payments to top executives 
if they lose their jobs in a change of control at their company 
asked whether he intended to seek a trustee to manage greyhound 
jordan said he had no plots or plans to ask the bankruptcy court 
to take any drastic steps and was waiting to see how greyhound 
handled the bankruptcy 
left unresolved is whether the company will have to pay back 
wages to striking workers in an unfair labor practices claim set to 
be litigated before the national labor relations board in washington 
this fall 
judge schmidt approved greyhounds requests to pay 2 million in 
accumulated cod payments owed to various shipping customers and to 
honor prefiling deposits for charter trips 
court documents indicate greyhounds largest unsecured creditors 
are financial services and insurance companies but a list of debt 
holders stretches out over 1800 pages ranging from junk bond 
holders to parts and tire suppliers 
schmidt also allowed the company to file a single disclosure 
statement for all six greyhound entities involved in the bankruptcy 
the courtroom was packed with 18 attorneys for various parties in 
the case including greyhound the union and creditors 
the preliminary order allowing operating expenses lasts until the 
june 28 hearing 
schmidt also allowed the company to hire the houston law firm of 
weil gotshal amp manges as its lead counsel 
an hour before the hearing greyhound announced it was 
withdrawing a tender offer for junk bonds 
we have withdrawn our tender offer so that we can focus on 
mapping out a sound debt restructuring plan for the court said j 
michael doyle senior vice president and financial officer 
on may 21 greyhound asked holders of 225 million of its junk 
bonds to sell them back at steep discounts totaling about 90 
million the company said the move was crucial to avoid the 
bankruptcy filing 
the offer was to expire june 18 
greyhound attorneys said they filed in brownsville because its 
eagle bus manufacturing inc subsidiary is based in the south texas 
city

precious metal futures prices fell thursday on new yorks 
commodity exchange with gold prices approaching fouryear lows 
on other markets energy futures resumed a slide grain and 
soybean futures were higher and livestock and pork futures were 
mixed 
gold traders reacted to overnight selling by the japanese and 
traders in the middle east by selling traders said gold prices 
approached their lowest levels since mid1986 
this is the third time in as many months that the arabs have 
sold gold said merrill lynch amp co analyst jim steel 
steel said middle east investors are shifting portfolios out of 
gold into other financial instruments including sterling and us 
treasury bonds because of rising interest rates 
adding to pressure on gold were fears the soviet union again will 
enter the market and sell gold to pay for imports 
gold settled 280 to 340 lower with the contract for delivery 
in june at 35460 a troy ounce silver was 17 cents to 23 cents 
lower with june at 5013 a troy ounce 
energy futures after trading higher for most of the day 
finished lower on the new york mercantile exchange 
the market rose at the start of trading as investors continued to 
take advantage of low prices said randolph donney an energy 
analyst with merrill lynch 
reports that exxon corps bayway nj refinery was back in 
business after a maintenance shutdown triggered a selloff he said 
exxon later announced it was resuming product shipments from the 
plant but production of finished products would not resume until 
the end of june 
analysts attributed market nervousness to overproduction by 
members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and to 
a large buildup of gasoline distillate and crude oil stocks 
west texas intermediate crude was 19 cents to 26 cents lower with 
july at 1667 a barrel heating oil was 21 cent to 41 cent lower 
with july at 4690 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 60 cent to 
125 cent lower with july aat 5761 cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures were higher on the chicago board of 
trade corn futures led the advance as adverse weather conditions 
continue to influence the market 
there was more rain in the southern midwest crop areas 
increasing the prospects for a smaller than anticipated us corn 
crop this year said susan leighty an analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc 
soybean prices were boosted by strong corn futures and concern 
about planting delays but the jump in soybean futures was limited 
by speculation that some intended corn acreage will be switched to 
soybeans if the southern midwest dries out by midjune corn takes 
longer to mature than soybeans 
wheat futures gained on concerns the wet weather has lowered the 
quality and quantity of the winter crop and is delaying harvesting 
leighty said 
wheat prices also received a boost from word the us agriculture 
department has targeted the soviet union for 2 million metric tons 
of export bonus wheat 
wheat was 1 cents to 3 cents higher with july at 334 a 
bushel corn was 4 cents to 9 cents higher with july at 285 a

the federal government will investigate whether the 
proposed merger between norton co a us manufacturer with defense 
contracts and a french company raises national security concerns 
it was announced thursday 
executives announced the 18 billion merger between norton and 
frances compagnie de saint gobain this spring thwarting a hostile 
bid made by a british company btr plc for worcesterbased norton 
when btr was fighting for control of norton massachusetts 
politicians said they would try to block the bid because nortons 
technology should be protected 
but when saint gobain one of the worlds leading glass makers 
came forward to rescue norton with a friendly tender offer

review 
with the news of the investigation thursday nortons stock

position is there should not be any problems 
the investigation is scheduled to last 45 days 
the 90pershare tender offer was scheduled to expire friday 
but saint gobain has extended it to june 27

plants that use large amounts of solvents 
the organization used statistics published earlier this year by 
the environmental protection agency compiled from annual reports by 
industrial plants to the agency 
according to the epa 46 billion pounds of toxic chemicals were 
released by industry into the air water and into the ground in 
1988 the latest year for which data were available the epa has 
said it could not estimate the resulting health risks because it has 
no information on the extent of human exposure to the chemicals 
citizen action gave the total as 62 billion pounds the group 
included 16 billion pounds sent away for disposal or to municipal 
treatment facilities the epa does not consider the 16 billion 
pounds to have been released into the environment 
of the total releases cited by citizen action about half of the 
chemicals were released in 10 states louisana texas ohio 
indiana illinois tennessee michigan california pennsylvania and 
florida 
major toxic polluters however were found in many parts of the 
country 
the eastman kodak co was the second largest source of 
cancercausing emissions the group said its complex of plants in 
rochester ny released more than 97 million pounds of 
cancercausing chemicals the company in the past has said the 
releases are not a health hazard 
the 3m corp a minneapolisbased manufacturer of a variety of 
products such as recording tape and sandpaper led the list of 
companies releasing chemicals that may be linked to birth defects 
it released 53 million pounds of such chemicals including 16 
million pounds from a plant in hutchinson minn the group said 
rick renner a 3m corp spokesman said the company has an 
extensive pollution control effort underway and the 1988 figures do 
not reflect new controls as some of the companys factories our 
emissions will be down substantially this year he said 
sedgwick county in kansas containing wichita was the third most 
polluted county on the list largely because of vulcan chemicals 
which has a plant there and the widespread use of solvents at a 
boeing co plant 
vulcans releases are mostly through the injection of chemical 
wastes into deep wells industry says such releases are a safe 
disposal method but environmentalists say they could threaten 
groundwater 
southern california ranked high on emissions largely because of a 
concentration of petrochemical plastics aerospace and other 
industrial plants the environmental group said 
citizen action is a washingtonbased federation of consumer and 
environmental groups in 27 states and claims more than 2 million 
members 
spokesmen for the chemical manufacturers association simply noted 
that the citizen action report was based on data that had been made 
public previously the industry group in the past has acknowledged 
that toxic releases from chemical plants are too high and says its 
member companies are working to reduce them

the government boosted its efforts to stem the 
dollars rise against the japanese yen from february through april 
but by the end of the quarter it was market sentiment that actually 
stopped the climb the federal reserve said thursday 
the fed and the us treasury sold 178 million in the three 
months ended april 30 nearly 90 percent of it to buy yen the fed 
said in its quarterly foreign exchange report the remaining 200 
million was used to buy west german marks 
in the previous three months october through january the 
government spent 750 million intervening in currency markets all 
of it to buy yen 
although purchases more than doubled in the latest quarter it 
was far far lower than the earlier threemonth period last 
year sam y cross a fed executive vice president who released 
the report at a press conference 
the governments purchases last year included a record 1192 
billion in yen and marks during the three months ended july 31 and 
5871 billion in the following three months 
the dollar rose 10 percent against the yen during the 
februaryapril period this year while declining by less than 05 
percent against the mark 
the dollar saw its steepest climb of the period against the yen 
from late february through early april the climb subsided as the 
market awaited the april 7 meeting of financial officials from 
governments of the socalled group of seven leading industrial 
nations the fed said 
also in april the market came to view the bank of japans 1 
percent increase in its discount rate as sufficient to lessen 
downward pressure on the yen then the japanese stock and bond 
markets began to recoup some of their losses according to the 
report 
the dollar hit a low for the period of 1436 yen on feb 19 but 
began to rally after election victories for the liberal democratic 
party in japan and predictions that interest rates outside japan 
could rise further weakening the yen the government sold 650 
million to buy yen between february 23 and march 2 
also fears that german inflation would accelerate due to the 
pending currency union between east and west germany strengthened 
the dollar against the mark it reached 17237 marks on march 1 
between march 5 and march 27 the treasury sold 830 million to 
buy yen and sold 200 million for marks the purchases were made by 
the us treasury as the fed temporarily put its intervention 
program on hold the fed and treasury normally split the funds used 
for intervention 
the temporary halt in intervention came after some fed officials 
said they were concerned that high amounts of purchases like those 
in 1989 could cause doubts about the feds commitment to curbing 
inflation according to the report 
the governments currencyintervention programs can have the 
unintended effect of increasing the supply of dollars and some 
feared inflation could result 
furthermore the feds holdings of foreign currencies were 
approaching the 21 billion authorized by the federal open market 
committee the fed decided to stop making purchases until the 
committees march 27 meeting where an additional 4 billion in 
holdings were authorized also the fomc decided to retain 
tightmoney policies 
the government intervened twice more on march 28 and april 9 
selling 50 million for yen each time

jaws failed to terrify boaters and king kong 
swung from a bridge only sporadically but universal studios opened 
its 630 million attraction thursday to an enthusiastic crowd with 
50 hollywood stars in their eyes 
isnt he cute isnt he short and cute teenager marla 
working said of michael jfox one of the stars brought in for 
inaugural ceremonies at the combination theme park and 
filmproduction center 
even as universal studios florida was being inaugurated 
executives of parent companies mca inc and rank organisation plc 
were announcing plans for similar theme parks in europe and japan 
and for a second gated attraction on the 444acre property in 
orlando 
but few details were available on the future projects 
universal which will compete with the nearby disneymgm studios 
for some 13 million annual visitors to central florida experienced 
opening day glitches with some of its major rides 
the sixstory tall kongfrontation sound stage was closed to the 
general public because the sixton steelandfur monster was able to 
go through his computeractivated terror routines only in stages a 
program that melds all the segments into one smooth hopefully 
frightening performance was inoperative a company spokesman said 
a similar problem afflicted the 24foot killer shark jaws 
technicians temporarily placed off limits a boat ride across the 
amity lagoon during which passengers are attacked by the 
computerized razortoothed shark 
a recreation of a san francisco earthquake for passengers aboard 
a subway train was only in partial operation and actor charlton 
heston who starred in the movie earthquake became the main 
attraction at that site 
i think most of our visitors saw all the movie stars as a 
tradeoff for the problems with the rides said company spokesman 
joe curley but we offered full refunds to anyone who was really 
put out by some of the rides being closed we had only a few 
takers 
fox and heston were joined by bill cosby linda blair jimmy 
stewart ernest borgnine sissy spacek and dozens of other stars 
mca president sid sheinberg praised park creator jay stein for 
turning swampland into dreamland and took note of the companys 
competitor down the road 
universal studios florida is the beginning of the symbiotic 
process of filmmaking and tourism in florida sheinberg told some 
1500 invited guests to the inaugural ceremonies 
stein said there would be an announcement later this year about 
the new parks expansion plans including a second gated attraction 
for which tickets could be purchased separately 
sheinberg who just returned from europe said he hoped an 
announcement could be made in two or three months about the 
selection of a new theme park site either in paris or london 
personally id like to see it in britain said sir patrick 
meaney chairman of the rank organisation of london but he said 
we are equally supported by both governments 
universal also plans a park in japan with nippon steel 
universal studios florida has a capacity of about 40000 but 
officials have said attendance would be held below 20000 if 
necessary for the first few weeks until the shakedown process for 
both personnel and the hightech equipment is completed 
universal hopes to attract about 5 million visitors in its first 
year and stein told reporters that somewhere between 3 or 4 
million people would put us in the black

scheringplough turned to wasserstein who had earlier expressed 
an interest in maybelline said an executive who declined to be 
identified 
wasserstein said it is financing the deal without highyield 
junk bonds 
were doing this with strictly a healthy dose of equity and 
bank debt mckeon said 
the final details of the financing have yet to be ironed out but 
the mix would be about 30 percent equity and 70 percent bank debt 
mckeon said 
wassersteins purchase of maybelline is contingent on routine 
government approval of all sales of companies over 100 million 
most of scherings 300 million in cosmetics sales in 1989 were 
generated by maybelline a schering spokesman said

martin s davis chairman of paramount 
communications inc testified thursday that ivan boesky in 1985 
doggedly pursued a leveraged buyout of paramounts predecessor gulf 
amp western industries inc and threatened a takeover fight 
despite repeated rejections boesky did not accept no as an 
answer davis said at the federal securities fraud trial of former 
boesky associate john a mulheren jr 
the more we said no the more he asked us to think about it so 
in order to facilitate his leaving we said wed think about it 
davis testified under questioning from assistant us attorney e 
scott gilbert 
mulheren 40 is accused of inflating the stock price of gulf amp 
western to 45 in october 1985 by purchasing 75000 shares to help 
boesky make more money in selling his stake back to the company 
boesky who previously testified at the trial paid 100 million 
in penalties and pleaded guilty to one felony to settle the biggest 
insider trading case ever in exchange he gave government 
investigators incriminating information about several associates 
including mulheren 
davis said he first met with boesky on sept 5 1985 amid rumors 
and media reports that boesky and others were contemplating a 
takeover of gulf amp western after it sold off its manufacturing and 
textile holdings for 1 billion in cash 
at the meeting attended and arranged by investor carl icahn 
davis said boesky told him he held 49 percent of gulf amp westerns 
stock and proposed that davis agree to a leveraged buyout at 50 per 
share 
when davis rejected the proposal as ridiculously low boesky 
said he would increase his holdings to 99 percent and then demand 
two seats on the companys board 
davis then chairman of gulf amp western said his response to 
boeksys proposal was an emphatic no 
he said icahn also held 49 percent of the companys stock but 
told him he was not a party to boeskys proposal 
at a second meeting on oct 1 1985 davis said boesky continued 
to persist in his leveraged buyout proposal telling davis he could 
personally earn 100 million to 200 million 
davis testified he told boesky he had no interest in doing 
business with him especially in a plan that he thought would 
disenfranchise shareholders 
boesky then offered to sell back his holdings in gulf amp western 
at 45 per share which was higher than its trading price on the new 
york stock exchange davis said david testified that he said he 
would only buy back the stock at the market price 
davis said he had a telephone conversation with boesky on oct 
16 1985 the night before gulf amp western bought back all 67 
million of boeskys and icahns shares in the company 
he said that during that conversation boesky reiterated his 
buyback offer of 45 per share but that davis rejected it because 
the stock closed that day at just above 44 
the buyback took place on oct 17 when the price of the shares 
rose to 45 davis said 
prosecutors claim mulheren aided boesky in boosting the price of 
the stock by purchasing 75000 shares on oct 17 
davis also testified that mulheren at an oct 3 1985 meeting 
offered help in monitoring boeskys activities in connection with 
gulf amp western 
davis said he made some uncomplimentary statements about boesky 
and that mulheren certainly didnt disagree 
in a later telephone conversation that took place before the 
buyback davis said mulheren told him he didnt believe boesky owned 
any gulf amp western securities davis said mulheren never told him 
about his own purchase of the gulf amp western stock 
in addition to stock manipulation mulheren is charged with 
concealing ownership of other stocks to help boesky cheat on taxes 
and evade federal securities laws

conagra inc has agreed to buy beatrice co 
for 134 billion in cash and stock in a deal that puts several of 
the nations leading food brands on the same corporate shelf the 
two companies announced thursday 
this is a major league acquisition said stephen carnes an 
analyst with piper jaffray amp hopwood in minneapolis 
the deal completes the divestiture of beatrice by the investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which bought the company then 
a huge foods and consumer products conglomerate in a 61 billion 
leveraged buyout in 1986 
since then beatrice has sold off most of its businesses but 
still retains such wellknown food brands as hunts wesson 
manwich peter pan snack pak swiss miss la choy swift premium 
butterball eckrich and reddiwip 
conagra an omahabased company with annual sales of more than 
15 billion has a stable of brand names in the frozen food market 
as well as selling unbranded products such as animal feed and 
fertilizer 
this is clearly a major strategic opportunity for conagra 
said charles m harper conagra chairman and chief executive officer 
one of conagras most important longterm objectives has been 
to establish a strong sales and distribution system to the 
shelfstable section of the grocery store he said beatrice 
will fulfill that objective 
expansionminded conagra last year lost a bidding war for poultry 
processor holly farms corp which was acquired by tyson foods inc 
in a 14 billion deal conagra did pocket 50 million in 
termination fees and other expenses 
the company sells food products under such brands as healthy 
choice banquet armour classics morton chun king and kids 
cuisine frozen foods armour processed meats and country pride 
chicken products 
under terms of the conagrabeatrice agreement conagra would buy 
beatrice for 1150 a share from kohlberg kravis partnerships and 
management investors beatrice would have 12344 million shares 
outstanding assuming the exercise of warrants for its shares 
the purchase transaction consists of approximately 626 million 
in cash net of warrant proceeds 355 million in conagra common 
stock and 355 million in two series of conagra preferred stock a 
total of 134 billion the companies said 
the deal which is subject to approval by federal regulators was 
announced after the close of trading on the new york stock exchange 
where conagras stock rose 75 cents to 32 a share 
we believe beatrice offers longterm value to conagra and our 
stockholders harper said we are also optimistic about 
nearterm earnings prospects 
henry kravis a founding partner of kohlberg kravis we are 
very excited about the combination of conagra inc and beatrice 
company 
four years ago together with new management of beatrice we 
began the process of reshaping beatrice from a diverse conglomerate 
into a focused and more profitable food company he said 
todays announcement marks the successful completion of this 
process 
kkr said investors who put 420 million of equity into the 
beatrice buyout reaped a total of about 22 billion from the 
selloff of its businesses representing a compound annual rate of 
return of more than 50 percent 
for the fiscal year ending feb 28 beatrice reported earnings of 
12 million on sales of 426 billion the company reported it had 
trimmed its longterm debt to 987 million from 1252 billion a 
year earlier 
conagra had sales in excess of 15 billion for the fiscal year 
that ended may 27 its earnings statement is expected to be released 
later this month 
beatrice was one of the nations biggest food and consumer 
products conglomerates owning product lines that included cocacola 
bottlers huntwesson foods swifteckrich meats stiffel lamps 
samsonite luggage tropicana juices max factor cosmetics and the 
avis car rental agency 
the 1986 buyout led by kohlberg kravis at the time was the 
biggest leveraged buyout ever and one of the largest nonoil 
company takeovers of all time 
after the deal beatrice began selling most of its businesses to 
pay off the buyout debt and generate a return for investors who put 
up money for the deal 
avis was sold to a group led by its employees tropicana to 
seagram co ltd beatrices international food businesses to the 
investment firm tlc international and a score of other companies to 
a group led by former beatrice chairman donald p kelly

hitachi ltd a leading japanese electric machinery 
maker said it has produced the first prototype of a 64megabit 
memory chip 
the company said the development of the dynamic random access 
memory chip puts it in the lead in the race to produce future 
generations of memory chips which are used in products ranging from 
computers to compact disc players 
the tiny circuits etched in the semiconductor chip are only 03 
microns or millionths of a meter wide the chip can hold about 64 
million binary units of information enough to hold the equivalent 
of 512 english newspaper pages or one hour of music recorded on 
compact discs hitachi spokesman takafumi ichinose said thursday 
that should lead to the development of a variety of new 
products he said 
hitachi expects to begin marketing the chip in 1995 he said 
each generation of memory chips is generally replaced by a new 
generation with four times as much capacity every three years 
the most advanced dram chips currently being marketed have a 
capacity of four megabits

defendants in the securities case against american 
continental corp and its lincoln savings and loan unit have until 
next april 1 to decide if they will testify at the trial a federal 
judge ruled thursday 
the ruling came despite the protests of a lawyer for new york 
financier michael r milken who claimed milkens own legal 
situation would make it impossible for him to decide whether to 
testify in that time frame 
us district judge richard m bilby chief judge for the arizona 
district also set a sept 30 1991 trial date and said he would 
hear the case in tucson 
the judge disposed of a series of motions heard an update on the 
cases 32 milliondocument depository and ordered an attorney for 
the federal office of thrift supervision to ferret out ots employees 
who may have abused attorneyclient privilege in denying documents 
to american continental lawyers 
american continental which bought lincoln in february 1984 
triggered a rash of suits and countersuits when it filed for 
reorganization under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy code on april 
13 1989 the next day the forerunner of the ots took control of 
lincoln 
not long after about 23000 investors claimed that officers of 
the holding company or lincoln misled them into buying more than 
200 million in junk bonds by passing them off as sound investments 
the class action was filed in federal court in los angeles it 
has been transferred to bilbys court and combined with the 
bankruptcy filing and a resolution trust corp racketeering suit 
against american continental chairman charles keating jr and other 
american continental insiders under the blanket term of multi 
district litigation 
in addition keating who has maintained that federal regulators 
caused the 2 billion lincoln failure by taking over a healthy 
thrift has filed two suits in us district court in washington 
one seeks to set aside the conservatorship of lincoln the other is 
a 300 million personaldamages suit against federal officials 
bilby said he would investigate the allegation of michael 
kennedy an american continental attorney that the ots had withheld 
documents that the company needs in its suit by claiming the files 
were privileged 
kennedy said nonlawyers who do not have the right to claim a 
professional privilege have classified the documents as privileged 
i want you to tell me sooner rather than later who did it 
bilby told ots attorney donald wall 
bilby set an april 1 deadline for defendants to decide if they 
will invoke the fifth amendment privilege against 
selfincrimination he said anyone indicted from now until 
midfebruary would have 45 days after indictment to make the same 
decision 
milken is a defendant in the classaction suit through his 
defunct drexel burnham lambert investmentbanking firm which 
underwrote many of american continentals and lincolns securities 
milken pleaded guilty in april to six felony counts and paid a 
record 600 million fine he is to be sentenced oct 1 
because of his legal problems milken is not in a position to 
meet the april 1 deadline to decide if he will testify at the trial 
argued david l kornblau a new york lawyer for milken 
kornblau also argued that milken was a peripheral figure in the 
keating case prompting bilby to quip if he has such a small part 
in this case this decision cant be any problem
