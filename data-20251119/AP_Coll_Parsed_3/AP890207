a bus driver yelled i have no brakes 
moments before a city bus slid off a winding stretch of road and 
plunged down a 60foot cliff killing 19 people and injuring 22 
authorities said 
the accident monday occurred about four miles from downtown on a 
curved steep portion of road on the outskirts of this baja 
california resort fire department officials said 
of the 22 injured treated at local hospitals several were said 
to be in critical condition said miroslava cuellar a spokeswoman 
for the city of ensenada 
the bus operated by the rojo y blanco line had not had a 
mechanical inspection in five years and had no insurance as required 
by state law cuellar said 
it is wellknown that there is corruption between the transport 
companies and state transit officials she said considering 
that these vehicles are allowed to operate without inspections and 
without insurance and that drivers are paid not a salary but by the 
number of passengers they can cram into their buses it is clear 
there is corruption 
the bus driver and 13 passengers died in the accident five more 
passengers died at hospitals on monday and tuesday chavez said 
a spokesman for the fire department jose luis chavez said bus 
driver enrique hernandez de jesus apparently lost control of the 
vehicle while trying to negotiate the curve 
one surviving passenger reportedly told investigators that the 
bus driver said hang on tight i have no brakes moments before 
the bus slid over the cliff 
chavez said he hoped the tragedy would bring an investigation of 
bus transit practices in ensenada he said some of the buses were so 
unworthy that they were no better than coffins on wheels 
a woman who lives about 200 yards from the accident scene said 
she ran to see what happened after hearing a tremendous crash 
it was a horror scene said leticia perez de la rosa 
people were screaming begging for help and i started to cry 
a mass funeral service is planned wednesday for the dead said 
ramon moreno owner of a funeral home that is handling the 
arrangements

the united states should act as a 
mediator between south africa and mozambique in a bid to resolve 
mozambiques 12year civil war foreign minister pik botha said 
tuesday 
botha said at a news briefing that the talks should include the 
governments of south africa and mozambique with the united states 
mediating and the soviet union welcome to participate 
he did not say if the talks should include rebels of the 
mozambique national resistance who have been waging a guerrilla war 
since 1977 in a bid to undermine the countrys marxist government 
south africa backed the rebels in the early 1980s but says it 
halted assistance in 1984 under the terms of a mutual nonaggression 
pact with mozambique 
mozambique has accused south africa of continuing to aid the 
rebels a charge south africa denies south african president pw 
botha visited mozambiques president joaquim chissano in september 
and relations have improved during the past year although 
mozambican officials still contend on occasion that south africa 
continues to support the guerrillas 
no government acknowledges assisting the rebels who have ravaged 
mozambiques economy with hitandrun attacks on civilian and 
military targets 
mozambique is one of the poorest countries in the world and an 
estimated 6 million of its 15 million people need food aid 
the united states is the leading donor of aid to mozambique 
which has increased ties with western nations in recent years 
although most of its weapons come from the soviet union 
there is no doubt in my mind that the mozambique war will 
have to stop botha said i have no illusions about what is 
ahead of us but i know it can be done 
he said he envisioned negotiations similar to last years talks 
on southern africa involving cuba angola south africa and us 
mediators more than a dozen rounds of negotiations culminated in 
december with an agreement for cuba to withdraw its 50000 troops 
from angola and for south africa to grant independence to namibia 
or southwest africa 
botha said today that the southern africa agreement appears on 
track cuba already has withdrawn more than 3000 soldiers from 
angola although it was not required to reach that figure until 
april 1 
south africa is to begin implementing namibian independence on 
april 1 leading to unsupervised elections nov 1 
the angolan rebel movement unita was not included in the peace 
talks and has vowed to continue the 13yearold war until it has a 
powersharing agreement with angolas marxist government 
it is not clear how the mozambique national resistance would 
respond to any regional peace agreement in which it did not 
participate

jury deliberations began tuesday in the murder 
trial of billy glaze who was depicted by the prosecution as a 
pathological killer still savoring the ghoulish murders of three 
american indian women 
he hated women and he particularly hated indian women 
prosecutor pete connors told the jury of eight women and four men in 
his closing argument he had a fury in his gut he wanted to hurt 
them and hurt them badly and he wanted to kill them and to have them 
die in anguish 
mr glaze had hellish fantasies that he couldnt keep to 
himself and he acted on them connors said 
defense attorney michael colich decried the lack of physical 
evidence in the case and attacked the credibility of prosecution 
witnesses the witnesses placed glaze at the scenes of two slayings 
and in the presence of the three victims before their deaths 
the jury which got the case tuesday afternoon after 11 days of 
testimony retired for the night and was to resume deliberations 
wednesday 
glaze 45 a drifter who pretended he was an american indian 
went on trial jan 23 on six counts of firstdegree murder in the 
sexual mutilation and slayings of kathleen bullman 19 angeline 
whitebirdsweet 27 and angela green 26 in 1986 and 1987 in 
minneapolis 
colich who called only four witnesses compared with 70 brought 
by the prosecution characterized glaze as a nonviolent drifter who 
called attention to himself by saying despicable things about women 
he said police were not thorough in their investigation of other 
suspects because of public pressure to solve the serial killings 
not one piece of evidence points to billy glaze but because he 
has a bad mouth and because he left town they think he did it 
colich said they police and prosecutors are going to get that 
man if its the last thing they do 
connors told the jury that glaze killed the three women in 
similar fashion leaving their nude bodies in places where they 
could easily be found the identical way in which the bodies were 
sexually mutilated proved that a pathological killer was responsible 
for the deaths connors said 
he killed these women in an unbelievably ghoulish fashion and 
hes sitting in jail enjoying it connors said 
the prosecutor reminded the jury of testimony from former prison 
acquaintances of glaze who said he admitted to the killings he also 
displayed a note written by glaze that said i killed them i was 
mad at them

the secondranking democrat on the senate armed 
services committee said tuesday night he now opposes the nomination 
of john tower to be secretary of defense and added that more fbi 
investigation may delay the confirmation vote until after next 
weeks senate recess 
although he hasnt counted noses sen james exon of nebraska 
said in an interview there are other committee members who feel as 
he does exon said he had been troubled by allegations about the 
former texas senators drinking and dealings with women as well as 
his financial involvement but he made up his mind tuesday 
exon said his decision came in the evening after an fbi report 
that had been promised was further delayed because of a new 
unspecified allegation exon said he was also angry at how the white 
house handled what was supposed to have been the final fbi report 
i really came to that decision tonight after or about the 
time that the fbi report was delayed and after the shenanigans of 
today exon said i can tell you were not going to vote on this 
until we get what looks like the final report 
exon said he was concerned with the perception that tower 
has not recovered from what obviously was a drinking problem at 
one time and about potential conflicts of interest stemming from 
towers dealings with defense contractors 
according to wednesdays editions of the new york times 
president bush called tower on tuesday evening to discuss the 
allegations against him also the times reported that the 
allegations had to do with towers financial dealings 
because of the latest allegations since the fbi first 
investigated tower a report from the agency isnt expected for 
several days exon and others said congress is taking a weeks 
recess next week if the panel votes to approve tower that 
recommendation would then go to the full senate 
exon wouldnt tell the associated press whether sen sam nunn 
dga the panels chairman is opposed to the nomination although 
both cbs and the times said he was nunn was neither at home nor his 
office when the ap tried to reach him 
at a news conference sen john warner of virginia the ranking 
republican on the committee said white house counsel c boyden gray 
told him of the new charge but he was not advised of the 
specifics 
nunns office issued a statement saying the fbi report has not 
been delivered to the committee i am informed it has not been 
completed 
earlier nunn said he had lingering concerns about allegations 
against tower but gop senators said a preliminary fbi report 
provides no grounds to disqualify tower 
warner said he was briefed by the white house and in turn 
briefed the gop members of the committee about the latest fbi 
inquiry into the allegations 
warner said the preliminary report provides at the judgment of 
white house counsel no basis on which senators could find the 
factual situation that would amount to any disqualification 
exon said however he never received the report on which the 
republicans were briefed he then said he found out the report was 
not finished 
the committee last thursday put off a vote on whether to 
recommend full senate confirmation and asked the fbi to review the 
allegations 
at the white house bush met with nunn and warner for about 45 
minutes a meeting requested by the committee chairman according 
to warner the tower nomination was among the topics discussed 
warner said 
in the meeting with nunn bush reiterated his support for tower 
the president told him tower was an excellent nominee and hoped 
thered be a vote soon said presidential spokesman marlin 
fitzwater he nunn did not speak out against it or ask that it 
be withdrawn 
warner said he has asked that nunn be briefed by the white house 
and the full committee assemble to see the written fbi report when 
it is finished 
but nunn expressed irritation at not being informed about the 
briefing to warner obviously there have been some unofficial 
briefings going on that i as chairman of the committee have not been 
part of he said 
nunn said he wont be satisfied with an oral report i like to 
read the answers and reflect on them you have to put the whole 
picture together and make your conclusions from it 
sen james sasser dtenn emerging from a luncheon meeting of 
democratic senators said nunn had told senators that cooperation 
inside the panel was breaking down on partisan lines 
sen john mccain rariz a member of the armed services 
committee said all the charges that i know of were without 
substance 
we cant have an openended situation where were going to wait 
until all the allegations are in we have to have a vote he said 
sen orrin hatch rutah who is not a member of the committee 
said there was an impression among gop senators that there may be 
an underlying attempt to delay the nomination 
sen william cohen rmaine who attended the briefing with 
warner said there has been no substantiation of the major charge 
which prompted the new investigation 
republicans think its time to vote cohen added 
but nunn said all allegations have to be considered saying the 
committee would look foolish if more charges surfaced after a 
cursory review of the charges 
warner as he emerged from a meeting with senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan and gop members of the panel said he expects the 
panel to vote after it reviews the report he did not provide a 
specific time 
it is my expectation the committee will find as i have found 
that the evidence in part one two three four and now part five 
which will be made available does not provide a basis for any 
disqualification he said

a doctor is being sued by two former 
patients who say he took them out socially and impregnated them 
then performed unwanted abortions on them including one whose fetus 
was in its eighth month 
carmen brutchen hertzinger of anderson sued dr pravin d 
thakkar an obstetriciangynecologist in madison circuit court last 
week kathy collins of madison county filed her claim against the 
doctor nov 4 
hertzinger claims she became thakkars patient in october 1982 
on her first visit to his office in nearby frankton about 30 miles 
northeast of indianapolis thakkar suggested they see each other 
socially and hertzinger accepted according to the complaint 
hertzinger claims she became pregnant with thakkars child in 
february 1983 thakkar is accused of administering drugs to 
hertzinger the following oct 28 and causing her to deliver the 
eightmonthold fetus in his home he told her the baby was 
stillborn and he had taken care of it the complaint says 
however hertzinger said tuesday that she was conscious during 
part of the procedure and heard a babys cry 
i was very much conscious at the time that i heard my baby 
cry she told wishtv in indianapolis there were many times of 
unconsciousness but this was a time that i was very conscious and 
theres something about a babys cry that you dont forget 
thakkar who continues to practice medicine denied the 
allegations 
all i can say is the facts in the matter will not stand up to 
these allegations he said 
thakkars attorney michael lacey said he was told hertzingers 
infant was stillborn at a local hospital wishtv reported tuesday 
that although state law would require a death certificate for a 
stillbirth none was filed with the madison county health department 
during that time 
lacey also said the indiana attorney generals office was 
investigating thakkar as a result of the complaints 
collins claims thakkar fathered her unborn child and that he 
aborted the fetus with a medical instrument during an examination on 
jan 9 1988 
during the examination collins said tuesday thakkar told her 
she was not carrying a child 
i breathed a sigh of relief and i felt an excruciating pain 
that sent me to the top of the examining table she said i felt 
the instrument dragging on the examining table i told him to 
take it out 
thakkar again manipulated the instrument causing more pain she 
said 
at that point i just rolled off the top of the examining 
table the instrument fell out and i went to the bathroom she 
said 
thakkar also denied collins claims but did say he had an 
onagain offagain relationship with her at one time 
indianapolis attorney robert york who represents both women 
said they were seeking damages for the loss of the fetuses and for 
emotional harm 
i cant imagine what it would be like to be a mother and have 
something growing inside you that you wanted and to have it taken 
from you in the way that it was york said 
madison circuit judge fredrick spencer signed a temporary 
restraining order against thakkar on thursday preventing him from 
attempting to sell transfer or otherwise dispose of his assets 
pending a hearing feb 13 
the order came after york filed a petition to set up a 
receivership for thakkars assets claiming the doctor advertised to 
sell real estate in madison county after collins filed her complaint

q mr president there have been hints that gorbachev may 
propose a test to defuse the situation in central america i wonder 
if you see the possibility of superpower deals in central america 
and if so what you if you could suggest what would be acceptable 
to you 
a i dont know about a deal but i can see a possibility of 
cooperation in central america because i would like the soviets to 
understand that we have very special interests in this hemisphere 
particularly in central america and that our commitment to 
democracy and to freedom and free elections and these principles is 
unshakable 
and i dont think they really have substantive interests in this 
part of the world certainly none that rival ours 
so i would like to think they would understand that 
and there are so many areas where we could demonstrate a new 
spirit of cooperation and this would clearly be one of them 
so id like to think that is the way that the matter would be 
approached by the soviets 
yeah a followup 
q could i follow up and ask you whether an understanding on 
central america whether youd be willing to include abandonment of 
aid to the contras as part of such an understanding 
a i wouldnt make a deal on that with the soviets nor would 
that come up 
i dont believe youd ever have a i cant see a situation of 
that nature arising knowing as i do what will be negotiated and 
discussed with the so i think thats a so hypothetical as to not 
even be a possibility of any kind 
yeah charles and then i do have to run 
q mr president we still dont know what the taxpayers burden 
is in here out of this 40 billion and cents first from sampl funds 
and the shortfall from treasury funds how big is it and have you 
in going through your budget had to knock out some things to pay 
for this 
a weve had to knock out a lot of things on the overall budget 
for a lot of different reasons but id like to leave this to dick 
for the questioning to give the specific amounts 
it is shared as ive indicated and he can give you the amounts 
that are involved

listen thank you all very much 
and now im going to turn this over to secretary brady 
and then i in order i guess theyll refer to each of these 
others 
huh 
q mr president one more word for the word for the small 
q back here mr president 
a what was that substantive question laughter 
q all the way in the back we didnt see you get back in this 
area 
a we didnt get that far back no 
but if theres been an egregious offense to those in the back 
benches i will take one parting question and inasmuch as you 
raised it fire away 
q thank you very much mr president back on the ethics issue 
a couple of your prospective 
a mindful that the last question always does get you in great 
trouble go ahead laughter 
q a couple of your prospective nominees one of your 
prospective nominees and your counsel have just recently changed 
their minds on matters that would have violated the ethics rules 
under the reagan administration did you have difficulty in getting 
the word out that times would be tougher under your administration 
a no i dont think so 
for example if youre referring to the boyden gray matter which 
i think you are that matter was reviewed every single year by the 
office of government ethics 
and he was deemed in compliance every single year 
but now weve got a new ball game here 
hes the general counsel here in the white house and im the 
president 
and ive set out rhetorically the highest possible standards and 
were trying to back that up by findings from this commission 
and so i do think that that weve got weve got to be very 
careful about perceptions of impropriety when it comes to conflict 
of interest not rumors or innuendoes of one sort or another 
i dont think you can i should deal in those things 
but when it comes to perceived conflicts of interest id like 
our people to bend over backwards 
and i think thats what has happened in both the question of lou 
sullivan whether hes entitled to all he did was ask am i 
entitled to continue these arrangements with this small university 
and all boyden did in my view now is to try to go a step beyond 
what the government ethics office has said to avoid the perception 
of impropriety 
but so i think it might be different now 
i have to approach it differently as president not that you have 
lower standards but i just think that again this whole question o 
perception weve got to look at it very very carefully 
but i want to be fair 
i do not want to have the loudest charge no matter how 
irresponsible be that that sets the standards 
weve got to achieve more objective standards 
and thats why im putting a lot of faith in the hope to put a 
lot of faith in the findings of judge wilkey and former attorney 
general griffin bell 
and they will be looking at all these matters in terms of 
reality and then to some degree im sure in terms of perception

so what might be legal and what might be perfectly sound 
ethically might have to be altered given this new approach because 
of perception 
its a delicate one 
i dont want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible 
way that good people just throw up their hands and say look who 
needs that kind of grief who needs it why should i have to give up 
all my whatever it is my health plan from the xyz company 
and yet on the other hand were in a different time now were 
in a time when weve got to try to set these standards as high as 
possible 
so i think dr sullivan did the right thing in asking what was 
proper 
i think boyden gray did the correct thing every year in asking 
what was proper and reviewing his own personal holdings in a family 
company with the ethics office but now taking another step because 
of perception in this case 
so weve got to reach weve got to work with these individuals 
to find the proper answer and weve got to work with the commission 
to try to codify these standards 
q sir if i might follow up you said during the campaign very 
clearly that your staffers would not take outside income i wonder 
why they need a legal opinion to understand that 
a they had a legal opinion saying it was perfectly proper from 
this family company 
and so now were changing that and saying look theres this 
different perception problem here in this new era so lets bend 
over as far backwards as we possibly can to recognize that 
thank you all very much 
q what about leveraged buyouts mr president 
a theres your lbo man right there referring to brady 
laughter

theres no way of getting around it anymore 
london has become a filthy city 
and this despite its manicured gardens carefully preserved 
historic monuments and architectural treasures 
some of the capitals littered streets have become obstacle 
courses of trash bags fastfood wrappers beer cans and dog 
droppings 
british vips are forever returning from abroad saying how 
littered london looks compared with shiny zurich or spotless 
brussels 
too much of london has become dirty degrading and 
depressing says the latest report on the citys litter scourge 
london with nearly 7 million residents generates about 14 
million tons of waste annually says jeff cooper of the london waste 
regulation authority a watchdog body new york city with a 
population of more than 7 million collected 8 million tons of trash 
last year according to the citys sanitation department 
a lot of londons garbage becomes litter 
to reach the trendy restaurants and west end theaters of soho or 
covent garden patrons often must dodge overflowing garbage bags 
heaped on curbs and around lampposts 
at subway stations commuters tread gingerly over slippery potato 
chip bags and cellophane wrappers and step around wads of gum that 
cover stairways and escalators 
in londons financial district stockbrokers and bankers leave a 
daily 90ton trail of newspapers coffee cups and fastfood wrappers 
london is well on the way to gaining an unenviable distinction 
of being the most littered and cluttered capital of any advanced 
country in the world said lord st john of fawsley chairman of 
the royal fine art commission which released the latest litter 
report 
our streets are disfigured by rubbish 
prime minister margaret thatcher has threatened tougher litter 
laws and some communities are trying to clean up their sidewalks 
the problem is that many britons simply believe its someone 
elses job to pick up after them say judy hillman who wrote the 
report and graham ashworth director general of the tidy britain 
group 
the litter threatens londons tourist industry says michael 
medlicott chief executive of the british tourist authority 
we have a bad reputation and a bad image he said london 
is one of the dirtiest cities in the world 
the tidy britain group a charity has produced a tv ad showing 
central londons oxford street crowded with pigs of the twolegged 
and fourlegged varieties 
a man is seen sprouting a pigs tail through his trousers as he 
opens a letter and discards it in a hedge a woman at a bus stop 
tosses a used tissue under her seat and her hand becomes a pigs 
hoof 
lack of personal discipline is undoubtedly largely to blame 
ms hillman says 
whether or not this decline in standards out of the home stems 
from the permissive society lack of parental control bad manners 
or overexpectation with regard to the ability of them to create 
and maintain a clean environment for us the result is plain to 
see 
there are other factors too 
few london boroughs have pooperscooper laws so pet owners 
dont clean up after their animals 
recycling isnt common and cans and bottles carry no refund most 
londoners live in apartments with little kitchen or communal storage 
space and many must put their trash bags on the curb days before it 
is collected 
some businesses reluctant to lose selling space dump empty

barbara tuchman a twotime pulitzer 
prizewinning author whose books revealed the lessons of history 
died monday of complications following a stroke she was 77 
tuchman was admitted to greenwich hospital on saturday and died 
monday afternoon said hospital spokeswoman eleanor hannon 
tuchmans latest book the first salute a look at the 
american revolution and the dutch revolution that preceded it by 200 
years has been on the new york times bestseller list for more than 
nine weeks 
she said it would be her last book because of failing eyesight 
tuchman wrote 10 books winning the pulitzer prize for history 
for the guns of august in 1962 and for stilwell and the 
american experience in china in 1971 
in 1978 she was awarded the gold medal for history of the 
american academy and institute of arts and letters she has received 
22 honorary doctorates 
she also wrote the proud tower a story of europe before 
world war i and a distant mirror the calamitous 14th century 
which traces the tumult of the period by following the career of a 
feudal lord enguerrand de coucy vii 
the guns of august the book that brought her fame when it 
was published examined how the military buildup in europe during 
the opening years of this century led inexorably to the outbreak of 
world war i 
it was a favorite of president john f kennedy because of its 
lessons for leaders in the nuclear age and he presented a copy to 
british prime minister harold macmillan 
tuchman was born on jan 30 1912 in new york city and graduated 
from radcliffe college in 1933 she lived in greenwich 
her mother alma morgenthau was the daughter of henry morgenthau 
sr woodrow wilsons ambassador to turkey 
while sailing with her family to visit her grandfather in turkey 
in august 1914 tuchman witnessed the naval battle between the 
english ship gloucester and the german ship goeben in the 
mediterrean although only a young child at the time tuchman said 
the battle remained a vivid memory through frequent family retelling 
and she recounted it in the guns of august 
tuchman began her writing career as an editorial assistant and 
occasional correspondent for the nation which her father 
investment banker maurice wertheim bought in 1935 to save from 
bankruptcy she covered president roosevelts 1936 campaign and the 
spanish civil war 
during world war ii she worked for the us office of war 
information she once described her job as to write stories beamed 
to europe trying to acquaint our european listeners much against 
their will with the extent of americas war effort in the far 
east 
her first book was bible and sword an account of the 
founding of israel which was published in 1956 after being rejected 
by a number of publishers 
the experience of writing history affected me as i suppose 
heroin does the addict and from then on i was caught she wrote in 
an autobiographical sketch 
as an historian i belong to the how rather than the why 
school tuchman wrote i am a seeker of the small facts not the 
big explanation a narrator not a philospher 
with each book i approached nearer as i hope to my goal of 
presenting history as literature 
she married lester r tuchman a physician on june 18 1940 
as it happened on the day that paris fell which then seemed to us 
almost more important than marriage 
she was elected to the american academy of arts and letters in 
1971 
in addition to her husband she is survived by three daughters 
four grandchildren and a sister

moslem guerrillas who captured the 
huge ghazi abad government farm smashed much of the equipment 
despite its importance to reconstruction because it was made by the 
hated soviets 
offices classrooms and residential buildings were damaged 
machinery was burned livestock were taken away and milking machines 
and other modern equipment smashed 
burnedout tractors and bulldozers dotted the treelined roads of 
the farm 15 miles east of jalalabad in eastern afghanistan along 
with hulks of afghan army tanks and trucks charred remains of 
textbooks and farming manuals the residue of guerrilla bonfires 
littered roadside flower beds 
a billboard advertising a film on modern farming methods still 
hung above the entrance of a movie theater that had been set afire 
we burned it because it showed russian films said one of the 
guerrillas who drove government forces out of ghazi abad last month 
a guerrilla giving a tour of the dairy section of the complex 
shrugged off questions about the wrecked milking equipment we 
dont want enemy cows he said 
scores of mujahedeen the islamic holy warriors who began 
fighting after a communist coup 11 years ago sat in the abandoned 
buildings in turbans or fur hats brewing tea and talking 
others manned rocket launchers outside sitting on small benches 
taken from classrooms some decorated their weapons with pink roses 
guerrilla commanders said every effort was being made to limit 
damage as their forces push back government troops noting the value 
of modern complexes like ghazi abad in rebuilding 
some admitted it was difficult to restrain their men and keep 
them from attacking anything associated with the marxist government 
and its soviet sponsors 
we know there are mujahedeen who only think about fighting 
said ahman ehsan a guerrilla guide they dont think about the 
future that we will need this place 
every effort will be made to avoid major attacks on cities in 
order to minimize civilian casualties the commanders said adding 
that their men had been told to protect civilians and avoid causing 
damage whenever possible 
some guerrillas said they wrecked parts of ghazi abad because the 
buildings and equipment were made by the soviets 
we dont want help from russia not even functioning farm 
equipment said khialuddin a young guerrilla commander who uses 
only one name he pointed at a row of damaged soviet combine 
harvesters 
he and other commanders said the government formed after the fall 
of teh marxist regime which they predict is imminent will look to 
western nations for aid and equipment to rebuild and modernize the 
country the united states has been the chief arms supplier to 
insurgents based in neighboring pakistan 
in the future when an islamic government is built we dont 
want russian equipment we want american and japanese equipment 
khialuddin said 
commanders at ghazi abad said the complex would be reconstructed 
the large orchards some buildings and the irrigation system were 
not damaged 
the farm was built by soviet experts in the late 1960s under an 
agreement with zaher shah the last king to help develop and teach 
modern farming methods afghanistan is among the worlds poorest 
nations and exiles say it has few advanced agricultural centers 
soviet technicians helped manage the farm after the kremlin sent 
military forces to afghanistan in december 1979 the last red army 
units now are withdrawing under a unmediated agreement and all 
are to be out by feb 15 
ghazi abads large orange and grapefruit crops were exported to 
the soviet union the guerrillas said displaying production records 
in russian 
a few soviet newspapers textbooks and cigarette packs scattered 
through the administration buildings were the only signs of of the 
foreigners who left a few months ago 
death to the russians was painted on an office wall

gov guy hunt filed a petition monday 
with the federal communications commission to block the state 
pension system from buying a television station saying it raised 
troubling first amendment issues 
hunt objected to the 70 million purchase agreement on several 
grounds including freedom of press implications raised by a 
statefunded agency gaining control of a major news outlet in the 
seat of government 
david bronner who manages the 8 billion portfolio of the 
retirement systems of alabama has defended his decision to buy 
wsfatv from cosmos broadcasting inc of greenville sc he said 
there would be no tampering with the news product 
were glad the issue is before the fcc where it ought to be 
said bill stephens an attorney for the retirment systems 
monday was the deadline for petitions to be filed concerning 
transfer of the wsfa license the hunt petition asks the federal 
agency to delay any decision until the courts in alabama resolve 
legal issues raised by the purchase agreement 
the fcc petition by hunt sets in motion what may be a protracted 
legal fight bronner has said the purchase is a done deal 
needing only fcc approval 
it is not a done deal said hunt at a news conference monday 
the petition filed by hunt contends the purchase of the 
longdominant commercial television station in the state capital 
raises clear and very troubling first amendment issues 
the petition says the purchase also would violate alabama law 
barring government from entering the field of private enterprise it 
further says the deal would violate fcc rules by giving state 
government two broadcast outlets in montgomery counting the states 
educational television operation 
william walsh deputy secretarytreasurer of the retirement 
systems says pension program officials feel there is no conflict 
with state law already he said the state is involved in the 
whisky business the state is in the hotel and motel business the 
state runs the state docks 
walsh referred to the alabama alcoholic beverage control board 
that regulates liquor sales most of which are sold from staterun 
stores and stateowned resorts that are part of alabamas state 
park system

made him the topranked player in tennis because the game just 
doesnt seem quite as important 
i wish i loved tennis like magic johnson loves basketball or 
pete rose loves baseball but i never did mcenroe who is entered 
in the 300000 volvo chicago tennis tournament that starts today 
told the chicago tribune 
when i look back and its easy to look back if i was number 
one again i would handle it differently and enjoy it much more 
instead i felt there was nowhere to go but down 
mcenroe who turns 30 next week is ranked no 3 in the 
tournament behind topranked ivan lendl and jimmy connors 
i dont feel im giving 100 percent mcenroe said and 
thats more important at this moment than being number one the fire 
isnt burning the flame has sort of dimmed a bit 
it doesnt seem quite as important ive been through it all so 
many times before and its sort of difficult to psych yourself up 
thats whats separating me from other players

farmers are keeping an eye on moisture 
conditions and world oilseed supplies as they look ahead to planting 
soybeans this spring the agriculture department says 
as of now the usda experts are looking for only a slight increase 
in this years soybean acreage from the droughtscarred 1988 season 
but conditions could alter that outlook 
results of a usda survey on planting intentions will be released 
on march 31 which will provide the first hard evidence of 1989 crop 
production plans the report will cover corn wheat cotton and a 
number of other crops in addition to soybeans 
soybean production dropped to 154 billion bushels last year the 
smallest output since 1976 as the national average yield plummeted 
20 percent to 268 bushels per acre the lowest since 1983 another 
drought year 
the droughts impact was heaviest in the corn belt states of 
illinois indiana iowa minnesota missouri and ohio says the 
departments economic research service the other major soybean 
producing regions the delta and the southeastern states had better 
yields in 1988 than in 1987 
last year in contrast to 1983 when crops appeared normal until 
about midsummer there were indications of drought by midjune 
by july some analysts were forecasting the most severe drought 
since the 1930s the agency said in a report the markets early 
awareness of the drought boosted prices although the drought was 
severe the market probably overreacted and this may affect prices 
into early 1989 
soybean prices in central illinois climbed to 892 per bushel 
last june but have posted declines virtually every month since 
the agency said because drought expectations were high and early 
prices may have peaked early 
the us soybean acreage rose to a record 714 million acres 
planted in 1979 from 469 million acres in 1972 as world demand 
helped bolster exports but plantings have declined most years since 
they were 709 million acres in 1982 the 589 million acres planted 
last year was the first increase in four years 
soybean acreage in both the eastern and western corn belt has 
been remarkably stable particularly since the implementation of the 
1985 farm law the report said 
recent changes in programs however have given farmers 
additional flexibility on plantings particularly in the corn belt 
states where soybean prices relative to corn prices are important 
the southeast and delta states face a different situation 
the report said it appears that much of the land planted to 
soybeans in the 1970s and early 1980s is now idle the report 
said attractive prices and low land rents could encourage soybean 
expansion in the regions 
the report added however acreage reponse is likely to be 
limited by the ability to bring fixed resources into production 
probably more than one season of attractive prices would be 
necessary to move such land back into production

the agriculture department says that 
conservation planning to protect highly vulnerable land from erosion 
has edged close to the twothirds mark give or take a few 
percentage points 
as of jan 1 the departments soil conservation service said 
monday plans were completed for 892 million acres or slightly 
less than 63 percent of the estimated 1417 million acres 
however scs chief wilson scaling said in his agencys statement 
we met our goal of having conservation plans on 65 percent of 
highly erodible land by jan 1 
when asked about the discrepancy between scalings claim and the 
jan 1 figures that were provided by the agency officials said the 
1417 million acres were an estimate that is expected to be adjusted 
downward to about 136 million acres at some future point 
thus said spokeswoman leslie wilder the goal for having 65 
percent of the plans done by jan 1 had been met 
to remain eligible for usda programs including crop price 
supports and other benefits farmers who operate highly erodible 
cropland must have a conservation plan approved by dec 31 1989 
as of jan 1 conservation plans have been implemented on 252 
million acres or 18 percent of the land

president bushs proposal for a 50 million 
program to combat fraud in the savings and loan industry would 
enable immediate deployment of extra investigators to probe 200 
pending cases the justice department says 
if this were approved these people could get right on the 
job investigating some 200 cases of suspected savingsandloan 
fraud david runkel a spokesman for attorney general dick 
thornburgh said monday 
we need more people there is no doubt about it runkel said 
after bush announced that he will ask congress to appropriate 50 
million a year to set up a task force to investigate sampl fraud 
bush proposed the financial institutions special team as part 
of his broader plan to raise deposit insurance premiums to help 
finance the 100 billion bailout of the troubled thrift industry 
the 50 million which must be approved by congress would 
support deployment of a couple of hundred additional fbi agents 
and 80 to 85 more federal prosecutors assigned to sampl fraud runkel 
said 
the extra people would double in general terms the criminal 
divisions field investment into this kind of activity runkel 
said 
after he took office last summer thornburgh sought a briefing on 
the savings and loan crisis and as a result of that briefing 
obtained a specific assessment of need runkel said 
this 50 million was a response to that request by the 
department to go after fraudulent activity runkel said 
runkel estimated that about 200 cases of savingsandloan fraud 
either are being investigated by the justice department or have been 
reported to federal authorities these include cases where we have 
some suspicion or we have reason to believe that fraud occurred 
he said 
runkel declined to say how many of the 200 cases are under active 
investigation 
the special team envisioned by bush would absorb two separate sampl 
fraud units that have investigated alleged wrongdoing by thrift 
industry officials in texas and oklahoma

the metropolitan opera which first performed 
mozarts idomeneo in 1982 starring luciano pavarotti brought it 
back monday night without pavarotti judging by the number of 
people who left before it was over idomeneo isnt going to fare 
too well without a superstar 
there is beautiful music in the opera which mozart composed when 
he was 24 but its in the style of its time 1781 with little to

president bush appears to be weathering the 
first crisis of his presidency without jeopardizing his honeymoon 
with congress 
bush had warned that any proposal he devised for bailing out 
insolvent savings and loan institutions would not be popular 
but the plan he outlined monday is winning respect if not enthusiasm 
from democrats and republicans 
now that the first concrete legislative proposal to issue from 
the bush administration has given the president a chance to prove 
his leadership attention shifts to the larger challenge his budget 
address to congress on thursday 
were still waiting for the other shoe to drop said norman 
ornstein a political analyst at the conservative american 
enterprise institute so much is going to revolve around the 
budget that right now it is more of a test 
bushs bailout announced after consultation with top financial 
aides and leading members of congress calls for increased insurance 
fees on banks and savings and loans and the issuance of 50 billion 
in special bonds to finance the cost of failing institutions 
absent is a controversial earlier proposal the administration 
floated for a direct fee on depositors 
however when pressed on the subject at a news conference bush 
conceded there was no way of guaranteeing that the insurance 
increase wouldnt be passed along to depositors 
nothing is without pain when you come to solve a problem of 
this magnitude bush said 
his plan also would increase the justice departments budget by 
50 million to seek out and punish those whose mismanagement of 
sampls bush blamed for much of the problem 
bushs plan according to some analysts was a relatively 
skillful recovery from the awkwardness two weeks ago when his 
administrations consideration of a direct fee on depositors became 
known 
a firestorm of criticism followed both on capitol hill and from 
the industry and the criticism did not abate after some top 
administration officials including chief of staff john sununu kept 
the controversy simmering by suggesting publicly that the fee 
remained a live option 
steve hess an analyst on the presidency at the brookings 
institute a liberal research organization said bushs 
selfproclaimed decision to face the problem squarely even 
before his budget speech was an effort to regroup 
it wouldnt have happened had not his administration bungled it 
last week hess said 
still hess said bushs relations with congress remain good but 
theres always a honeymoon when theres nothing on the table he 
said it may end up as a twoweek honeymoon 
bush called his proposal the fairest system that the best minds 
in this administration can come up with 
but by including congressional budget leaders early on in the 
process of developing the scheme bush gave the first solid evidence 
of his inaugural address vow to extend an offered hand to 
congress 
and for that gesture members of both parties voiced their 
appreciation 
i think the proposal is by and large a sensible proposal 
said sen donald w riegle dmich chairman of the senate banking 
committee 
rep trent lott rmiss predicted the major portion of it 
will fly 
and sen phil gramm rtexas exclaimed i think youre going 
to see some real bipartisanship here 
but gramm added that even though he supported the presidents 
approach any answer to a multibilliondollar problem wasnt 
something youd want to embrace and kiss on the mouth 
we have a big selling job bush conceded on monday

black conservative robert l woodson says he 
turned down the no 2 job at the department of housing and urban 
development out of fear the bush administration intends to copy the 
methods of the democrats in competing for the loyalty of the 
nations blacks 
going back to racespecific solutions and reigniting the alms 
race is inadequate to addressing the needs of the black 
underclass woodson said in an interview monday weve spent 1 
trillion in 20 years to aid the problems of the poor and we see now 
that onethird of black america is in danger of becoming a permanent 
underclass 
woodson said he had been offered the job as undersecretary of hud 
by secretary jack kemp and was undergoing fbi clearance 
he would have become one of the highestranking blacks in the 
administration president bush has selected only one black for his 
cabinet louis sullivan nominated as secretary of health and human 
services 
woodson noted that bush has met since his election with jesse 
jackson coretta scott king and benjamin hooks of the naacp and with 
other traditional civil rights leaders 
he said he feared those sessions showed that the president would 
adopt old ideas to the exclusion of new approaches by local 
grassroots leaders 
woodson once mentioned as a possible bush choice to head hud is 
the founder of the national center for neighborhood enterprise 
which promotes black selfhelp efforts and champions turning over 
public housing projects to their tenants 
previously he was with the american enterprise institute a 
conservative think tank he calls himself a radical pragmatist 
it is important for this nation to have competitive ideas 
woodson said im just fearful that if the bush administration 
limits itself to reaching out to black americana just through the 
civil rights leadership it will miss the opportunity to include the 
experiences views and opinions of grassroots leaders who represent 
the new faces new ideas 
if i were on the inside and i saw the trend moving in that 
direction i would feel morally bound to speak out and challenge it 
it would be unfair to the administration and to my constituents 
among the poor for me to have to be silent im too independent for 
that

president bush said he expects members of his 
administration to bend over backwards to avoid any appearance of 
ethical conflicts after several of his top appointees faced 
questions on that very issue 
bush on monday said that two of them white house legal counsel 
c boyden gray who is also bushs top ethics adviser and cabinet 
nominee dr louis sullivan had gone beyond what was legally 
required by disentangling themselves from outside business 
arrangements 
and bush said he had seen nothing so far beyond rumor and 
innuendo regarding a third defense secretarydesignate john tower 
whose confirmation is on hold while a senate committee checks new 
allegations of drinking and womanizing by the former senator 
bush launched his administration with a series of events in which 
he proclaimed his commitment to ethical government but several of 
his nominees ran into questions on such issues almost immediately 
last week his choice as agriculture secretary clayton yeutter 
acknowledged letting a tobacco company pay for a lavish 
inauguralweek reception in his honor and bushs choice to head the 
department of housing and urban development former rep jack kemp 
ran into questions about his acceptance of speaking fees exceeding 
house limits kemp was confirmed after agreeing to forgo some of the 
fees and defer others 
gray who oversees ethics policy for bush on monday resigned as 
chairman of a familyowned multimilliondollar communications 
company that had paid him hundreds of thousands of dollars while he 
was on bushs vice presidential payroll gray was not bound by a 
reagan administration policy against such arrangements because he 
worked for bush who had more lenient standards as vice president 
we are in a new era on these matters bush said at a news 
conference monday matters that might have been approved and 
looked at one way may have a different perception today so i 
think it might be different now i have to approach it differently 
as president 
bush said that when it comes to the appearance of conflict of 
interest id like our people to bend over backwards as far as 
we possibly can 
when his dual role was first reported gray had said he would 
stop accepting pay from summit communications inc but would 
continue to head the atlantabased company 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said gray 
subsequently decided to resign from summit on the advice of the 
chairman and vicechairman of bushs new ethics commission to 
avoid any possibility of even the appearance of a conflict 
gray also announced he was putting his personal assets 
estimated at 10 million into a blind trust 
sullivan the presidents nominee as secretary of health and 
human services last week asked if he could take a paid sabbatical 
leave from the morehouse college school of medicine while serving in 
the cabinet sullivan said later he would forfeit his accumulated 
sabbatical pay estimated at 300000 
bush said that both gray and sullivan had gone beyond the laws 
requirements to eliminate any questions about propriety 
gray could face additional questions however the new york times 
reported today that the office of government ethics is investigating 
whether gray should have reported 89000 in deferred income from 
summit in 1985 and 1986 donald campbell deputy director of the 
ethics office told the times that deferred income had to be 
reported in the year it is earned 
bush on monday also stood by tower against new allegations of 
womanizing and drinking and other matters bush said he still 
endorses tower and that he should not be drummed out of the cabinet 
appointment by rumors 
some allegations have been examined by the fbi and found 
groundless bush said but he added if somebody comes up with 
facts i hope im not narrowminded enough that i wouldnt take 
another look 
bushs new ethics panel is to come up with recommendations for 
ethics standards for the administration and proposed congressional 
legislation 
bush said that while he wants high ethical standards he doesnt 
want the rules to be so burdensome they keep qualified people out of 
government 
i dont want to have the standards set in such an irresponsible 
way that good people just throw up their hands and say look who 
needs that kind of grief 
and yet he added were in a different time now were in 
a time when weve got to set these standards as high as possible

congressional leaders are offering cautious 
praise for president bushs plan to bail out the savings and loan 
industry but many are wary of his proposal to sock the taxpayers 
for about half the 90 billion initial cost 
bush on monday offered a complex financing scheme mixing tax 
dollars with higher insurance premiums paid by banks and sampls 
he also called for an overhaul of the financial regulatory system 
aimed at preventing sampl problems from recurring vowed to pursue 
wrongdoers in the industry and pledged to protect insured deposits 
he recommended no direct fee on depositors 
in all the time since creation of the deposit insurance savers 
have not lost one dollar of insured deposits and i am determined 
that they never will the president said at a news conference 
under the bush plan which must be approved by congress the 
government would sell 50 billion in 30year in bonds as needed over 
three years to finance the cost of closing or selling about 350 
failed institutions thats in addition to the 40 billion pledged 
last year by regulators to rescue and prop up 223 institutions 
insurance premiums paid by financial institutions combined with 
tax dollars would pay the interest on the bonds and meet 
regulators 1988 commitments money to pay off the principal on the 
bonds would come from the sampl industry 
sen donald w riegle dmich the chairman of the senate 
banking committee said bush had presented by and large a sensible 
proposal and that the structural reforms make sense 
however riegle said the taxpayer cost was a substantial amount 
of money and said he was concerned it would cut into other 
programs such as the fight against drugs and education 
bushs budget director richard darman said the public would 
shoulder 54 percent of the burden over the 30year life of the plan 
he estimated the cost to taxpayers at 281 billion from 1989 
through 1994 over 10 years the cost would be 399 billion 
in my view that would be a little high said senate 
minority leader bob dole rkan it would begin to crowd some of 
these other programs congress wants like education the 
environment i would propose we shrink the taxpayer impact 
the spending is structured to help the president meet his no 
new taxes pledge by minimizing the impact on the fiscal 1990 
budget that bush will present to congress on thursday taxpayer 
spending would amount to 111 billion during the remainder of this 
fiscal year but would dip to 19 billion in 1990 it would bounce 
back to 6 billion in 1991 
bushs plan also would increase the insurance premium paid by 
sampls from the current 208 per 1000 of deposits to 230 from 
1991 through 1994 dropping to 180 after that banks premiums 
would rise from 83 cents now to 120 in 1990 to 150 after that 
administration officials who spoke after bush left the news 
conference stressed that the money raised by the higher bank 
premiums would go into the banks own insurance fund the federal 
deposit insurance corp and would not directly pay for sampl problems 
however the money raised by the bank premiums would count as 
revenue on government balance sheets thus the government would be 
able to spend several billions of taxpayer dollars a year without 
adding to the budget deficit 
there is a lot of blue smoke and mirrors in the plan said 
rep charles schumer dny a member of the house banking 
committee i estimate that the convoluted scheme for selling the 
bonds will end up costing the taxpayers 600 million to 1 billion 
a year 
banks and savings and loans likely would try to pass on at least 
a portion of the higher insurance premiums to consumers possibly in 
the form of lower interest rates on savings accounts 
i would hope that wouldnt happen but theres no guaranteeing 
what the institutions will do bush said nothing is without 
pain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady said competition from money 
market mutual funds and other investments would prevent sampls from 
passing on much of the cost he acknowledged that some banks and 
sampls may get into trouble because of that 
there may be some failures but in the long run well have a 
much sounder system he said 
the announcement marked bushs first attempt as president to deal 
with a major problem he proposed 
an administrative merger of the federal deposit insurance corp 
which insures commercial banks and the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp which backs sampl deposits the agencies staffs 
would be combined but the money in their respective funds would not 
be mixed 
placing insolvent sampls under the control of the new deposit 
agency however a separate threemember board headed by the 
treasury secretary would oversee bailout spending 
regulatory changes including steps to reduce the type of risky 
investments that got the industry into difficulty and an expanded 
role for the treasury department in supervising sampls 
requiring sampl owners to put up more of their own money by june 
1 1991 capital requirements would be 6 percent the same as banks 
and double the current sampl requirement 
an additional 50 million to the justice department for 
investigation of wrongdoing within the industry maximum civil 
penalties against sampls and banks would be raised to 1 million a day 
and criminal penalties against executives would go as high as 20 
years in prison regulators also would be given authority to pay 
rewards to informants

a proposal by chief justice william h rehnquist to 
speed up resolution of appeals by death row inmates avoids the true 
issue says one legal authority while the head of americas lawyers 
urges caution with any such reform 
the lack of legal resources is the real problem said tanya 
coke of the naacp legal defense and educational fund after 
rehnquist unveiled the proposal on monday 
american bar association president robert raven said proposals 
for reform even modest ones must be carefully thought through so 
the integrity of the system and the rights of defendants are 
protected 
rehnquist told the aba that reforms are needed to reduce delays 
in resolving death penalty appeals that often mean postponing 
executions for years 
the abas house of delegates the policymaking body for the 
nations largest lawyers organization had a busy day in which it 
adopted a resolution endorsing legislation to ban discrimination 
against homosexuals 
twice before the group rejected similar proposals by narrow 
margins 
the delegates also approved a resolution urging congress to 
repeal the antitrust exemption granted the insurance industry 44 
years ago 
the repeal if adopted by congress would mean increased federal 
regulation of an industry lawyers blame for skyrocketing insurance 
premiums insurance industry officials have charged the lawyers with 
responsibility for the socalled liability insurance crisis 
the aba also unanimously called on congress to approve a 50 
percent payraise package that would mean higher pay for federal 
judges the us house of representatives was scheduled to vote on 
the measure today 
in his speech on the death penalty and other matters rehnquist 
acknowledged that many death penalty sentences and convictions are 
overturned by federal courts 
but to my mind the flaw in the present system is not that 
capital sentences are set aside by federal courts but that 
litigation ultimately resolved in favor of the states takes 
literally years and years and years rehnquist said 
the naacp legal defense and educational fund says about 40 
percent of state death penalty convictions and sentences are 
overturned by federal courts 
the chief justice cited the most recent execution in the country 
that of serial killer ted bundy in florida on jan 24 as an example 
of a system of death penalty appeals that is often chaotic and 
drawn out unnecessarily 
rehnquist noted that the supreme court turned down three separate 
emergency pleas in bundys behalf hours before he was put to death 
all three of these actions were being prosecuted simultaneously 
on the day before the execution of a prisoner who had been on death 
row for nine years he said surely it would be a bold person to 
say that this system could not be improved 
retired supreme court justice lewis f powell was appointed by 
rehnquist to head a committee of federal judges looking into the 
question and the aba also has a panel studying the issue 
rehnquist said he is not calling for a drastic curtailing of the 
right of convicted killers to appeal to the federal courts for help 
instead he said he wants modest changes aimed at 
consolidating appeals imposing deadlines for when they can be filed 
and assuring death row inmates they will have legal representation 
for federal court appeals 
in some states the average time elapsed between the commission of 
a crime and execution is more than 13 years rehnquist said there 
are more than 2000 prisoners on death row nationwide 
since 1976 when the supreme court allowed states to reinstate 
the death penalty there have been 106 executions nationwide 
more than 11000 federal court appeals were filed last year in 
death penalty cases 
on another subject rehnquist reiterated his endorsement of the 
pending increase in pay for federal judges 
these increases simply restore to federal judges the purchasing 
power that has been eaten away by inflation over the past 20 
years rehnquist said they are essential if we are to continue 
to attract from the financially greener fields of private practice 
the sort of experienced and capable lawyers whom we want as judges

a shy 19yearold who lived in a trailer 
with five other people is charged with killing two roommates and 
suspected in four other slayings in what police say could be west 
virginias biggest killing spree 
mark southern mccallister whose trailer was found with dead or 
malnourished animals has confessed to killing the two roommates but 
has not said why according to authorities 
investigators said they are looking for a motive and evidence to 
pin the four other deaths to mccallister a grand jury began hearing 
evidence this week 
right now everything in that case is being looked at said 
kanawha county prosecutor bill forbes 
mccallister is charged with killing brothers billy and otis 
sanson also slain were their sister bonnie sanson her boyfriend 
jimmy price her former boyfriend james schillings and 
mccallisters grandmother charlotte ruby ferrell 
ferrell 69 was found dead in her home the other bodies were 
found near a threetrailer compound behind the st albans moose 
lodge 
all were killed by a closerange shotgun blast to the head 
since he was 16 mccallister spent much time at the 12footwide 
trailer with the sanson brothers the sansons mother carol 
rutherford and rutherfords daughter 8yearold tammy and her 
granddaughter 2yearold victoria pauley 
the rutherfords and sansons took mccallister in after he had an 
argument with his parents but late last year some family members 
say domestic quarrels began at the trailer 
mrs rutherford 46 has moved away and wont talk to reporters 
access to mccallister has been denied by defense attorneys and 
prosecutors 
the sanson brothers were shot jan 8 the four others were found 
later 
otis 25 shot in the back and left in a camper trailer was 
found covered with cushions said assistant prosecutor reagan 
whitmyer 
billy 27 shot in face was left in the chickenwire dog pen a 
makeshift contraption littered with rusted coffee cans 
after mccallister was arrested the search intensified for four 
people who had been reported missing three of the missing lived in 
the trailer compound 
mccallisters grandmother was found in the bedroom of her st 
albans home jan 13 shot in the head at close range and wrapped in 
sheets and a curtain authorities said 
the door to the house had been padlocked from the outside 
mccallister had a key whitmyer said 
all three bodies were found the same way nude from the waist 
down but somehow wrapped or covered 
on jan 21 police began searching the area around the trailer 
compound and within 1 weeks found three more bodies 
ms sanson 19 was found buried on the grounds of an abandoned 
motel across us 60 from the trailers price 22 and schillings 
20 were found shot in a nearby junkyard all three appeared to have 
been dead for quite some time 
the local animal shelter received complaints about trailer and 
on nov 10 officials picked up 10 dogs that were starved for food 
and attention said sylvia shaffer of the county animal shelter 
after the sansons bodies were found more animals were picked up 
at the trailer six dogs two cats goldfish two turtles a 
rabbit a white rat a dead kitten a dead puppy and a dead 
mockingbird 
mccallister colored his natural red hair black after police 
sought him for questioning on jan 10 acquaintances said 
i remember that day said david smith who runs a body shop 
near the trailers i saw him walking by and had commented on his 
hair being nice and shiny and black 
it was not unusual to see mccallister walking in the area 
he used to skip school and hang around here bumming 
cigarettes smith recalled id give him a couple of dollars to 
sweep up the parking lot 
neighbors remember mccallister as quiet kind of shy and always 
looking for money 
i knew him for two to four months he would help clean up 
around the place said jerry norman of the moose lodge i would 
tell my janitor if he ever needed help to go back there and get him 
and give him 10 for helping 
greg perdew said mccallister used to sit on the porch and count 
a big stack of food stamps and he often wondered where 
mccallister had obtained them prosecutors said schillings and ms 
sansons food stamps continued to arrive at the trailers after they 
disappeared 
west virginias worst mass killings occurred in 1932 when harry 
powers admitted killing five people and was hanged historians say 
powers killed two women and three children in a garage called the 
chamber of horrors and buried his victims in a ditch

the food and drug administration has approved 
the expanded use of an aerosol drug to fight a lifethreatening 
pneumonia that strikes aids patients 
under the new rules the fda has approved the experimental use of 
aerosol pentamidine for aids patients who have had at least one 
episode of penumocystic carinii pneumonia or who have white blood 
cell counts that are at or below 200 per cubic millimeter 
the fda action recommends the use of aerosol pentamidine every 
four weeks as a preventive measure against the aidsrelated 
pneumonia the injectable form of the drug was approved in 1984 for 
patients who already had the pneumonia 
fda approval came after a san francisco study showed that using 
aerosol pentamidine lowered the incidence of the pneumonia among 
aids patients 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that renders the body unable to resist other diseases and 
infections it is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
a white blood cell called t4 helper is the primary immune cell 
attacked by hiv most healthy people have t4 helper cell counts of 
1000 per cubic millimeter

curbs on trade with the soviet union should be 
relaxed in light of the kremlins agreement to allow more jews to 
emigrate says the coauthor of the law that imposed the 
restrictions 
the letter by charles vanik a former congressman from ohio who 
cosponsored the 1974 jacksonvanik amendment reflects a fledgling 
movement among legislators and jewish groups for a reassessment of 
restrictions on trade with the soviets 
the jan 30 letter from vanik now in private law practice was 
written to edgar bronfman president of the world jewish congress a 
copy was obtained from the organization 
the group is one of several prominent jewish organizations 
advocating a reexamination of the 1974 amendment that imposes high 
tariffs on imports from any communist country denying its citizens 
the right to emigrate 
the amendment which had been originated by the late senator 
henry jackson was designed to stop soviet restrictions on jews 
seeking to emigrate and has served as leverage in the hands of 
successive administrations in their dealings with moscow

exhaustion from the presidential campaign and 
postelection letdown led kitty dukakis to a drinking problem gov 
michael dukakis said in announcing that his courageous wife has 
begun treatment for alcohol abuse 
at a news conference monday dukakis said his wife who conquered 
a 26year addiction to diet pills had entered a private alcohol 
treatment center in newport ri 
he said his wifes underlying chemical dependency flared into 
bouts of excessive drinking after his loss to george bush in the 
november presidential election 
as she has now discovered whether it comes in a bottle or is 
solid if you are chemically dependent you are chemically 
dependent dukakis said 
it is a disease from which you never recover youre always 
recovering 
the former democratic candidate who has often appeared subdued 
and distracted since the election acknowledged that he has felt 
physically exhausted and disappointed by the defeat he quickly 
added im not chemically dependent 
the 52yearold mrs dukakis stumped tirelessly for her husband 
and was called a key influence in his decision to seek the 
presidency since the election mrs dukakis has traveled widely 
began a new career as an author and lecturer and welcomed the birth 
of her first grandchild 
but the 55yearold governor said it was clear within some 
weeks after the election that something was happening 
unfortunately a combination of physical exhaustion the stress 
of the campaign effort and the postelection letdown all combined to 
create a situation in which on a limited number of occasions while 
at home she has used alcohol in excessive quatities he said 
he said several episodes occurred when it was obvious that 
his wife drank too much after counseling failed dukakis said his 
wife and family in consultation with her doctor decided on 
residential treatment 
dukakis who does not smoke and rarely drinks even a glass of 
wine said his wife entered edgehill newport on sunday and will stay 
there about a month 
shes not only a great wife and a great women shes very 
courageous dukakis asking the public to respect her privacy and 
support her recovery 
the 28day program begins with up to seven days of intensely 
supervised and often grueling detoxification at 353 per day said 
gaele pesaturo a spokeswoman for the 160bed center 
the rest of the program is spent in one of the six 24bed 
recovery units at 271 per day where there is group and peer 
counseling recreation and spiritual advice she said 
its a very intensive program i think a person comes to 
edgehill newport and they have to do a lot of selfsearching a lot 
of acceptance ms pesaturo said a lot of education goes on 
here about the disease 
mrs dukakis who has struggled for years to quit cigarettes has 
had a history of chemical dependency dating to her teen years 
in july 1987 as her husbands campaign for the presidency was 
taking shape mrs dukakis announced that five years earlier she had 
entered a minnesota center where she overcame her addiction to 
amphetamines she took to control her weight 
she won praise for her candor and became an active campaigner 
often appearing for dukakis and speaking openly about her own 
struggle with drugs 
dukakis said he and his wife had agreed to delay her entry into 
the program until after the birth of their first grandchild last 
wednesday her son johns wife lisa gave birth to alexandra jane 
dukakis 
during the last three months mrs dukakis did not appear at her 
husbands side on several occasions when she might have been 
expected 
on jan 3 for example when dukakis made the surprise 
announcement that he would not seek a fourth term as governor some 
observers remarked on the fact that mrs dukakis was not present 
dukakis said monday his wifes condition had nothing to do with 
his surprise announcement not to seek reelection the governor who 
has left open the possibility that he would run for the white house 
again in 1992 was asked about the possible impact of mrs dukakis 
problem on another national campaign 
at this time im spending no time thinking about national 
office he said

iranian officials have told frances foreign 
minister that some foreign hostages in lebanon will be freed 
within a short period kuwaits staterun news agency reported 
foreign minister roland dumas flew to kuwait monday for a brief 
state visit after a twoday trip to iran 
the kuwait news agency quoted diplomats traveling with dumas 
said he dumas obtained a promise from responsible officials in 
tehran that a number of western hostages held in lebanon will be 
released within a short period the diplomats did not elaborate 
the report said 
iran has influence over the fundamentalist hezbollah or party of 
god which is considered an umbrella for groups holding most of the 
15 foreign hostages in lebanon iranian officials however 
dissociate themselves from the kidnappers 
the 15 hostages in lebanon are nine americans three britons one 
belgian one irishman and one italian the longest held is terry 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated press 
who was abducted march 16 1985 
in a statement at kuwait international airport dumas said his 
weekend trip to tehran achieved its objectives and was fruitful in 
many ways 
i discussed the entire file of frenchiran relations and laid 
down a blueprint for a future relationship he said 
iranian media generally were hostile toward the dumas visit 
pointing out that france was a major arms supplier to iraq during 
the eightyear iraniraq war halted by an aug 20 ceasefire 
in tehran foreign minister ali akbar velayati told a news 
conference monday that france and iran had agreed to forget the 
past and think of expanding mutual ties in the future 
but he accused france of not keeping a promise to free anis 
naccache leader of a proiranian terrorist squad jailed for 
attempting to assassinate a former iranian prime minister 
velayati said france had pledged to free naccache a lebanese 
national in return for an iranian promise to use its influence with 
the lebanese shiite factions for the release of french hostages 
formerly held in lebanon 
unfortunately they havent kept this promise velayati said 
adding we do hope that mr naccache will be released 
naccache was convicted of leading a fiveman squad in a 1980 
attempt to kill exprime minister shapour bakhtiar outside his home 
in a paris suburb bakhtiar was unhurt but a french woman and a 
police officer were killed and three police officers were wounded 
last week naccache appealed to iran to insist on his release 
implying that a pardon was part of the deal that led to freedom for 
the last three french captives in may 
on sunday former french interior minister charles pasqua 
repeated earlier french denials that a deal was made 
bakhtiar was the last prime minister to serve under the late shah 
reza pahlavi before the iranian monarchy was overthrown in 1979

pulitzer prizewinning cartoonist doug marlette 
whose syndicated comic strip kudzu revolves around life in a 
small southern town is leaving his native dixie for the big apple 
in his resignation letter monday marlette said he resigned as 
the atlanta constitutions editorial cartoonist because he was upset 
by the resignation of editor bill kovach three months ago 
kovach who hired marlette away from the charlotte nc 
observer in april 1987 resigned in a dispute with senior executives 
i have spent many sleepless nights over the last two months 
trying to find a way to stay here marlette wrote arnold 
rosenfeld who took kovachs place as editor of the atlanta journal 
and the atlanta constitution which are published by cox enterprises 
as a native southerner i came here inspired by the vision of 
bill kovach for worldclass journalism in this region so richly 
deserving of it wrote marlette who will join newsday on new 
yorks long island 
tragically that dream was thwarted like many southerners 
before me i head north with a sense of sadness and longing for what 
might have been 
constitution editorial page editor tom teepen said he knew of no 
disputes involving marlette there have not been any clashes here 
over cartoons teepen said 
born in greensboro nc and raised in laurel miss and 
sanford fla marlette has been drawing newspaper cartoons since he 
was 16 he spent 15 years at the observer before moving to atlanta 
marlette won a pulitzer for editorial cartoons last year for work 
at the observer and the constitution he was the first cartoonist to 
win a nieman fellowship at harvard university 
his editorial cartoons are syndicated to more than 125 newspapers 
in the united states and abroad and have been compiled in five 
books his kudzu strip based in the mythical town of bypass 
nc has been collected in four books 
leaving is a very sad thing i feel real ambivalence about 
it the 39yearold cartoonist said at the same time im 
excited about the opportunity 
obviously the addition of an exceptional talent such as doug 
marlette to the editorial pages of newsday will strengthen what 
we believe to be the best viewpoints in the new york area newsday 
publisher robert m johnson said in a statement 
marlette is expected to begin work for newsday which is owned by 
times mirror of los angeles in about three weeks

kitty dukakis recent episodes of heavy drinking 
after overcoming a long dependence on diet pills is a sadly typical 
pattern of switching from one abused substance to another doctors 
say 
it is obviously the case especially nowadays that addiction 
or dependence on more than one substance is rather common said 
dr peter nathan director of the rutgers center of alcohol studies 
in piscataway nj 
for reasons that are not well understood people who have trouble 
with one moodaltering substance are especially susceptible to 
excessive use of others 
drug switching does occur and the drug thats easiest to 
switch into is alcohol said dr roger weiss of mclean hospital in 
belmont its easy to get cheap legal and the most socially 
acceptable 
experts said that most researchers now reject the oncepopular 
idea that some people have addictive personalities instead people 
with addiction problems typically have little in common other than 
their addictions 
weiss said that people who abuse more than one drug may be 
addicted to mood change not just to a particular drug 
on monday gov michael s dukakis said that his wife had been 
admitted to the alcohol treatment program in newport ri 
mrs dukakis was treated in 1982 for a 26year reliance on 
amphetamines however the democratic governor said his wife had 
never had a drinking problem until shortly after he lost the 
presidential election on nov 8 
unfortunately a combination of physical exhaustion the stress 
of the campaign effort and the postelection letdown all combined 
to create a situation in which on a limited number of occasions 
while at home she has used alcohol in excessive quantities he 
said 
several doctors praised mrs dukakis for seeking help after such 
a relatively brief siege of alcohol problems 
for a public figure who knows any revelation about problems is 
going to be widely publicized it takes great courage to seek 
treatment said dr domenic ciraulo of new england medical center 
in boston 
this is a family that certainly knows about substance abuse 
he said its unusual to seek help so early but it shows they 
know the signs of trouble so well 
nathan said that if mrs dukakis drinking only began in 
november there probably has not been time for her to become 
physically dependent on alcohol 
if what the governor says is accurate they have been quite 
courageous in deciding to do something about this early nathan 
said the odds are far better that they will be able to get it 
under control and there wont be any permanent consequences 
dr patricia sutker of the veterans administration medical center 
in new orleans said that seeking treatment for alcohol abuse does 
not necessarily mean someone is an alcoholic 
you could go in because you dont like the fact that you drank 
heavily on a few occasions she said you want to nip it in the 
bud she might not be an alcoholic and wants to go in for some 
stress management

resolution today to make little richards tutti frutti the 
states official rock song 
georgia already has an official state song georgia on my

physicist ed wagner says hes found 
evidence that trees talk to each other if so they probably say 
nicer things than other scientists say about him 
wagner who left academia to start his own research laboratory 
says trees talk in signals that he calls wwaves 
explaining the phenomenon wagner pointed to a blip on a chart 
recording a tree being chopped it put out a tremendous cry of 
alarm he said the adjacent trees put out smaller ones 
an abstract of his research was published last fall in northwest 
science magazine 
wagner 58 holds a doctorate in physics from the university of 
tennessee he formerly worked at the oak ridge national laboratories 
in tennessee and taught physics at california state polytechnic 
university for five years 
he returned to his family home near grants pass in the 1970s to 
establish the wagner research laboratory so no one could tell me 
what i was doing scientifically was right or wrong 
wagner said his work has been greeted with skepticism but he 
remained confident it would be accepted one day 
for some people its so contrary to what they think that they 
wont bother to read the evidence he said but its just a 
matter of time

baltimore county judge dana levitz got to 
thinking about the ancient philosophical question who will judge 
the judges so he asked the lawyers who appear in his courtroom to 
do it 
levitzs effort to get evaluated which included sending 150 
questionnaires to lawyers who have appeared before him was 
prompted by his worries about how attorneys can change when they sit 
on the bench 
they can become pompous jerks in black robes said levitz 
40 who was a county prosecutor before he became a circuit judge 
three years ago 
i wondered if they were aware of it and then when i got here 
i realized how easy it is to become unaware theres no other job 
where theres no supervision 
county bar association president myles f friedman praised 
levitzs survey as fantastic and long overdue but there was 
no indication that the idea was going to catch on among levitzs 
colleagues 
i care what they think of me as a judge but i wouldnt do 
it said judge leonard s jacobsen i dont think it does any 
good that way 
levitz said he feels very positive about the 60 responses 
hes received so far some opened his eyes to problems he wasnt 
aware of he said 
for those judges interested in evaluating their skills i think 
this is an excellent vehicle he said for those who arent 
interested it wouldnt help

japans stockprofiteering scandal claimed yet 
another promiment casualty today as the chief of an opposition party 
resigned over his lucrative dealings with the company at the heart 
of the affair 
the socalled recruit scandal has shaken public confidence in 
japans government three members of prime minister noboru 
takeshitas cabinet have resigned because of links to the affair as 
have more than a dozen other government officials business leaders 
and media executives 
saburo tsukamoto 61 chairman of the democratic socialist party 
stepped down today amid pressure from party members who want to 
distance the party from the scandal he said he was not guilty of 
any wrongdoing and was quitting for the party sake 
if my resignation can bring gains for the party i decided it 
is better for me to withdraw now he told a news conference i 
would like to apologize to my colleagues and to the people for 
troubles caused by my involvement in the recruit scandal 
i believe my innocence was widely understood by my supporters 
but i also could not overlook the fact that some of my colleagues 
are concerned about the next election he said referring to 
upcoming voting in july for half the seats in the house of 
councillors the upper house of parliament 
tsukamoto will retain his seat in the house of representatives 
the democratic socialist party with 29 of 512 seats is the 
third largest opposition bloc after the japan socialist party and 
the komeito the clean government party 
since last summer the recruit scandal has become a subject of 
national debate as it highlighted the sometimes dubious connections 
between business and politics 
tsukamoto bought 10000 unlisted shares in recruitcosmos co a 
real estate subsidiary of the informationbased conglomerate recruit 
co through his secretary and earned about 77000 by selling them 
immediately after the company went public in 1986 
pressure had mounted on tsukamoto to resign because he was the 
only one of four opposition politicians linked to the scandal who 
had not taken responsibility for their roles 
the three others have given up party posts or parliament seats 
tsukamoto was first implicated in the scandal in october 
though the stock transactions were not illegal under japanese 
securities law they had a taint of bribery and influencepeddling 
prosecutors have questioned recruit executives as well as 
government officials in a bribery probe and reportedly are prepared 
to arrest several public officials for allegedly profiting from 
privileged access to prelisted shares in recruitcosmos co in 
exchange for doing favors for the company 
prime minister takeshita tried to erase the shadow of the scandal 
by reshuffling his administration last december but two cabinet 
members justice minister takashi hasegawa and ken harada director 
general of the economic planning agency have since quit because of 
links to recruit 
takeshita himself is tied to the scandal because his secretary 
bought prelisted shares in recruitcosmos but the prime minister 
denied any knowledge of the deal and has ruled out opposition 
demands to resign and call early elections 
the moderate democratic socialist party will likely toughen its 
stance against the ruling party in parliament now that its 
scandaltainted chairman is stepping down 
tsukamotos resignation also will likely fuel opposition demands 
that takeshita resign

savings and loan executives expressed some 
misgivings about president bushs rescue plan for the industry but 
many said they arent likely to pass along the costs of higher 
insurance premiums to customers 
when people say are they going to pass this premium on to the 
public i have to laugh said marion sandler president and chief 
executive officer of world savings amp loan association of oakland 
were not a costplus industry were going to have to eat it 
top officers at four other big california thrifts great western 
california federal glendale federal and home federal said they 
too were unlikely to cut interest rates for fear of losing 
depositors to banks mutual funds or the stock market all five 
thrifts are among the nations 10 largest 
under the bush plan which must be approved by congress the 
government would sell 50 billion in bonds to finance the cost of 
closing or selling about 350 failed institutions thats in addition 
to the 40 billion pledged last year by regulators to rescue and 
prop up 223 institutions 
insurance premiums paid by financial institutions combined with 
tax dollars would pay the interest on the bonds and meet 
regulators 1988 commitments money to pay off the principal on the 
bonds would come from the sampl industry 
bud koch chairman of the national council of savings 
institutions and president of first federal savings bank of 
cleveland said higher insurance premiums would imperil more thrifts 
this continues to bleed the healthy institutions there is just 
no end in sight koch said this is going to raise the cost of 
our funds and create more insolvencies 
the us league of savings institutions the industrys biggest 
lobbying group was more cautious saying it would neither endorse 
nor reject the plan 
league chairman barney beeksman said he was glad bush dropped an 
earlier proposal to levy a fee on depositors and reiterated the 
governments pledge to insure depositors but he found other parts 
of the plan burdensome particularly insurance premiums 
we see todays proposal as a first step only beeksman said 
the american bankers association took heart in assurances that 
even though banks insurance premiums would rise their insurance 
fund the federal deposit insurance corp would be kept separate 
from the sampl fund 
but jj pinola chairman and chief executive of first interstate 
bancorp in los angeles criticized the proposed increase in banks 
premiums and said the plan would inevitably force banks and sampls to 
cut interest rates for depositors or raise fees 
im somewhat appalled and looking for the right word to 
describe why someone in another industry that had nothing to do with 
the mistakes of the first industry now is being asked to pay 
pinola said its simply a bashing of the banks 
many sampl executives praised bush for moving quickly to tackle the 
longfestering problem 
i like what i see said james montgomery chairman and chief 
executive officer of beverly hillsbased great western financial 
corp the nations secondlargest sampl with 33 billion in assets 
i think hes showing some leadership saying weve got to get on 
with this problem and spreading the pain around a little bit 
montgomery said he supported the administrations insistence that 
thrifts put up more of their own money to back deposits and promise 
to crack down on fraud and mismanagement 
the initial reaction appeared favorable in texas where the 
depressed oil and gas industry has produced some of the biggest sampl 
losses 
we are pleased that he bush very strongly at the beginning 
and end of the press conference spoke of the full faith and credit 
of government behind thrifts said russ cobler a spokesman for 
san antonio savings association one of 350 insolvent thrifts the 
presidents plan is designed to help

human rights activist andrei sakharov contends a 
french newspaper misquoted him as saying opponents of mikhail s 
gorbachev could thwart the soviet presidents reforms or oust him 
sakharov also said monday that it had been his understanding that 
the conversation with journalist jeanpierre barou on which the le 
figaro story was based was intended to serve as material for a book 
not for a newspaper story 
le figaro published the interview jan 26 and an editorial in the 
soviet government newspaper izvestia attacked the reported comments 
last week 
in a letter published monday in the government newspaper izestia 
sakharov described his discussion with barou as a teatable 
conversation with a french guest he said his remarks were taken 
out of context 
sakharov a 67yearold physicist who won the 1975 nobel peace 
prize also criticized izvestias editorial for unjustly 
representing him 
he wrote that he and his wife yelena bonner said during the 
conversation that the couple believes the soviet union must hold 
direct elections and that the current system of indirect elections 
may increase the danger of gorbachev being overthrown and his 
policies cast aside 
meanwhile it was not noticed that my wife said gorbachev 
does not need to fear direct elections the people would necessarily 
elect him our country has no other leader he wrote in the 
letter to izvestia 
i fully agree with this he said 
i actively support perestroika gorbachovs reform campaign i 
am convinced its necessary for our country and the whole world 
he added stressing that gorbachev plays a special role in the 
soviet unions reform 
in the figaro article sakharov was quoted as saying the 
conservatives will overthrow gorbachev or at least impose their 
views on him 
le figaro quoted bonner as saying the only real defense for a 
chief of state is direct election why is gorbachev afraid we would 
elect him our country has no other leader 
she also was quoted by barou as saying she thought gorbachev will 
be overthrown soon i would not bet 10 rubles on gorbachev the 
paper quoted her as saying 
le figaro published a note feb 3 saying barou had told sakharov 
and his wife that they would be quoted when he met them in a 
sixhour interview conducted over three consecutive evenings in 
their moscow home 
barou asserted to us in a handwritten letter that he warned 
the sakharovs that extracts from their conversations would be 
published in several major newspapers according to the note 
on monday sakharov and bonner met with the pope john paul ii in 
the vatican it was sakharovs second trip outside the soviet union 
since he was freed from internal exile in december 1986 
the meeting with the pope in his library lasted an hour and 20 
minutes according to vatican spokesman joaquin navarro the 
unusually long audience was very nice bonner said they did not 
comment on what was discussed 
sakharov is in italy for five days to receive several academic 
and civic honors the trip comes as the soviet activist is running 
for a seat in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for march

actor todd bridges who starred in the tv 
series diffrent strokes was ordered held without bail on an 
attempted murder charge for allegedly shooting a man five times and 
trying to slash his throat 
bridges 23 was silent in municipal court on monday except to 
acknowledge his name and plead innocent 
from what i understand said deputy district attorney irv 
cohen if the defendant had been a better shot we would have had 
a firstdegree murder 
judge david s milton declared bridges a danger to the community 
and said an affidavit filed by police indicated the actor was a 
heavy cocaine user 
according to witnesses he sells sometimes to support his habit 
since he has spent much of his tv show earnings the judge said 
reading from the affidavit 
bridges played gary colemans older brother in the series from 
197886 
according to the affidavit bridges shot 25yearold kenneth clay 
on thursday while clay was standing then emptied the gun into him 
as he lay on the floor of a house in southcentral los angeles known 
as a drug hangout 
the affidavit said bridges then left and got a knife came back 
and tried to slash clays throat cutting his jaw 
harvey duckett 30 an associate arrested with bridges was held 
in lieu of 50000 bail cohen said duckett was quoted as allegedly 
yelling shoot him kill him as bridges shot clay 
bridges and duckett were arrested at the house bridges also had 
been arrested there two weeks earlier for investigation of 
possessing cocaine 
i think much of what the court heard is hearsay and may not be 
true but i cant disprove it at this time johnnie cochran 
bridges attorney told the judge 
the judge dismissed a request for bail and scheduled a 
preliminary hearing for feb 17 
bridges received a suspended sentence in january 1987 after 
pleading no contest to making a bomb threat in a case that stemmed 
from the bombing of an auto customizers car during a dispute over 
work on the actors porsche

it apparently helped marvin mitchelsons 
headaches sonny bonos sciatica whitey fords sore shoulder and 
david brenners bad back but medical officials say prescribing 
cocaine for pain has no place in medicine 
the state has told dr milton reder and 20 other physicians to 
stop prescribing whats called sphenopalatine ganglion block 
but reder who developed the method said monday he wont quit 
these days cocaine has a bad name what can i do about that 
he asked i say its the best local anesthetic 
brenner the comedian accused the state health department and 
the new york county medical society of a witch hunt they 
cant get noriega they cant get the crack dealers a few blocks 
away but theyre going after an 89yearold humanitarian 
for four decades reder has used cocaine legally purchased from 
pharmaceutical companies to treat a variety of maladies a liquid 
solution containing 13 percent cocaine is applied with metal swabs 
inserted through the nostrils against a nerve center at the base of 
the brain reder his patients and some doctors say the procedure 
relieves pain although no one knows why 
reders treatment was no secret he has participated in medical 
studies and been the subject of newspaper and magazine features 
which invariably focus on his many celebrated patients 
the state health departments objections are these reder doesnt 
always examine patients before treating them he doesnt make sure 
they are not former cocaine addicts who might become addicted again 
and he employs too much cocaine 
reder said that most of his patients have been examined many 
times before they come to him and that he does examine those who 
have not and he says he administers too small an amount of the drug 
to hook anyone 
he vigorously denied a daily news report that state investigators 
found about a halfdozen patients who went to reders office just 
to get high 
thomas coffey of the health department said prescribing cocaine 
for nonspecific pains is like taking a sledgehammer to a tack 
the state cites the new york county medical societys conclusion 
in 1975 that reders procedure has no basis in scientific medicine 
to warrant its use but the society also conceded that the 
procedure appears to help some patients and urged it be studied 
such an experiment is in fact planned by two yale medical school 
pain specialists who say they have used reders method successfully 
on two of three patients 
reder came to the attention of the health department because of 
his large orders of pharmaceutical cocaine after an investigation 
the department on march 1 ordered him and the other physicians to 
stop the treatments 
at first reder agreed but later wrote the department a letter 
saying he had changed his mind and wanted the medical society to 
review its opinion in a statement monday the society said that in 
1987 its peer review committee reconsidered and affirmed its 1975 
ruling on the procedure and planned no change it also said it was 
not considering legal or disciplinary action against reder 
state officials say they are still investigating and wont move 
against reder until they confer with the medical society 
meanwhile reders patients stand by their man 
bono who was treated for a pinched sciatica nerve said i 
guarantee youd get less drugs from him than you would from a 
general doctor 
film critic rex reed another reder patient said you dont 
feel stoned you feel better wouldnt you rather give somebody 25 
in cash and feel better than spend thousands of dollars and have no 
results 
ford the former new york yankees pitcher said saloonkeeper 
toots shor took him to reder for treatment of a sore shoulder which 
felt better the next day he said he didnt know the physician had 
used cocaine 
mitchelson the divorce lawyer who credited reder as the only 
doctor able to relieve his headaches said ive seen people go in 
there crippled in wheelchairs and walk out 
other patients reder says have included pablo picasso henry 
fonda and winston churchill 
reder said monday that news of the state investigation which 
appeared sunday in the daily news had already brought him new 
patients 
they all want to be cured he said ill treat them as long 
as they let me

cocaine is used routinely by doctors as a local 
anesthetic and patients often dont know they have received it an 
anesthesiologist said 
it is most commonly used to deaden nerves in the nose before 
inserting a tube through a patients nose into the airway said dr 
kuntala sinha an anesthesiologist and director of the pain clinic 
at new york university medical center 
it is also used by plastic surgeons when doing nasal surgery it 
is dispensed as a liquid solution and applied inside the nose with 
swabs she said monday 
cocaines advantage over other local anesthetics such as 
lidocaine is that it also constricts blood vessels sinha said 
when you pretreat the patient with cocaine it serves a dual 
purpose she said 
it will decrease the bleeding by shrinking the blood vessels 
and it increases the size of the nasal passage because it 
decreases the size of the blood vessels in the area it makes it 
easier to put in a large tube without bleeding and number two it 
is a very good local anesthetic 
cocaine is a controlled substance so it is kept locked in 
hospital pharmacies and is given out only in limited quantities 
sinha said 
she said that anesthesiologists routinely administer doses three 
or four times higher than those used by dr milton reder who has 
been ordered by the state to stop administering cocaine to treat 
pain and even at the higher doses the cocaine does not produce a 
high sinha said 
patients have consistently never even known about it she 
said even when the patients are told theyre getting cocaine they 
dont get a false high she said 
reders treatments differ from standard medical practice in that 
he uses cocaine to treat pain in places other than the nose sinha 
said 
she said that she has experimented with treatment similar to that 
used by reder and she has found that it helps about half of the 
patients who receive it furthermore patients do not appear to 
become addicted she said 
i dont think theres a problem with addiction if thats what 
the public is worried about she said the question is whether 
it works and if you see side effects medical journals contain no 
reports of serious side effects she said 
there probably is a role for this kind of treatment she 
said referring to reders methods its probably not accurate to 
dismiss it as a crazy idea

killing a woman then ordering her tied to an anchor and thrown 
overboard off the bahamas was acquitted of murder on the high seas 
by a federal jury 
william skip walton of delray beach was acquitted monday in 
the death of brenda blum 37 of fort lauderdale during a 
drugsmuggling trip six years ago 
the foreman of the us district court jury said afterward that 
the panel didnt believe the testimony of the governments two chief 
witnesses who admitted they participated in the killing 
the government didnt prove its case beyond a reasonable 
doubt said foreman louis agnello of pembroke park it was very 
frustrating because there was no body just the testimony of those 
two witnesses 
walton 46 pleaded guilty to marijuana importation and 
conspiracy charges before the start of the trial two weeks ago he 
seemed momentarily stunned at the verdict announcement then smiled 
and patted his attorney don ferguson on the shoulder 
his reaction was relief ferguson said all along hes 
maintained his innocence 
walton was quickly led away from the courtroom by us marshals 
he will remain in custody without bond until his march 13 sentencing 
on the drug charges 
walton who was cleared of murder charges 15 years ago in an 
unrelated case faces a maximum 10 year prison sentence for the drug 
charges he would have faced a mandatory life sentence if convicted 
of murder 
prosecutors said walton forced ms blum aboard his yacht beat 
her with a club and then ordered her tied to an anchor and thrown 
into the atlantic on dec 2 1982 
william pryor the boats first mate said he helped dump ms 
blums body into the water after she demanded a share of the drug 
cargo he agreed to testify against walton and plead guilty to a 
reduced charge of seconddegree murder 
david nesbit ms blums friend testified that walton ordered 
the woman thrown overboard and threatened to kill him if he didnt 
participate but after he was granted immunity from prosecution he 
testified he lied to authorities when he reported the murder

a group of relatives of pan am flight 103 victims 
has demanded the resignation of the head of the federal aviation 
administration saying he failed to maintain security on the doomed 
flight 
at an emotional news conference monday 30 people who lost loved 
ones on the downed jetliner accused the government and pan am of 
negligence before the dec 21 bombing they demanded the broadest 
possible congressional investigation of the tragedy that killed 270 
people 
my husband was murdered on the flight said a tearful wendy 
giebler widow of william giebler jr he never would have got on 
that flight if we had been given the facts and what we need to know 
is who is accountable 
the group chiefly demanded an accounting of why the government 
had not made public a terrorist threat that a us flight from 
frankfurt west germany would be bombed in december us airlines 
and embassy personnel were warned 
the fbi says well the bomb threat was really nothing more 
than a hoax said daniel cohen of port jervis whose daughter was 
aboard flight 103 if it was a hoax why did that plane blow up 
why is my daughter dead 
government officials have said they get similar unconfirmed 
threats on a daily basis and would cripple the airline industry by 
announcing them all the relatives called that policy immoral and 
possibly criminal 
further the group said in a statement that while the faa 
receives up to 500 threats annually fewer than 25 are rated 
highlevel as it said the frankfurt threat apparently was 
the relatives specifically blamed faa chief alan mcartor for a 
lack of security on the flight and called for his resignation they 
asked congress to make its investigation of the incident full and 
complete 
an faa spokesman did not return two telephone messages pamela 
hanlon a pan am spokeswoman noted that the threat had not 
identified a specific flight and she said pan am had increased its 
security after receiving the warning 
in an outpouring of emotion and frustration the relatives voiced 
a litany of other complaints ranging from their inability to 
recover their loved ones personal effects to the handling of the 
victims remains 
the new yorkbound flight which originated in frankfurt and 
changed to a larger plane in london exploded over lockerbie 
scotland all 259 aboard died as did 11 on the ground 
investigators blamed plastic explosives that had been smuggled 
aboard 
among the dead were 35 students returning from a syracuse 
university overseas study program syracuse announced plans monday 
to convert the universitys main entrance into a memorial to the 
students 
the centerpiece of the 500000 memorial will be a 4foothigh 
semicircular limestone wall on which the names of the students will 
be engraved according to virginia denton syracuses director of 
design and construction she said the project is to be completed by 
fall

gortari has told the united states it would accept the appointment 
of controversial career diplomat john negroponte as the next us 
ambassador 
opposition leaders in mexico say they oppose the choice of 
negroponte because he helped orchestrate the civil war in nicaragua 
and meddled unduly in honduran affairs while ambassador to that 
country from 1982 to 1985 
late monday the foreign ministry said it had sent a letter to 
the bush adminstration expressing support for the proposed 
appointment of negroponte currently a deputy national security 
advisor 
the white house has not announced negropontes candidacy for the 
job but sources in washington said last week that he would be 
picked to replace ambassador charles pilliod 
as us envoy to honduras negroponte had a major role in 
assisting the usbacked contra rebels seeking to overthrow 
nicaraguas leftist sandinistas honduras was a major base of contra 
operations 
in a statement the foreign ministry said 
by sending this letter the government of mexico expresses to 
the united states of america its desire that this career diplomat be 
chosen contributing to the strengthening of bilateral ties with 
equality and strict respect for the sovereignty of both countries 
it said negropontes designation would be within the spirit of 
the declarations president bush and secretary state james baker 
have made concerning the future of relations between the united 
states and mexico 
negroponte 50 was a close ally of the former head of the 
honduran armed forces gen gustavo alvarez martinez known as the 
godfather of the contra movement 
alvarez armed forces chief from 1982 until his overthrow in 
1984 was shot to death in the honduran capital of tegucigalpa last 
month a leftist group claimed responsibility 
as head of the national police in 1981 alvarez told thencia 
director william casey that the contras could operate from honduran 
territory thus allowing the movement to grow a preliminary 
ceasefire was signed by the warring nicaraguan parties last march 
but peace talks have since stalled 
mexico city daily newspapers have reacted angrily to negropontes 
possible appointment 
the daily excelsior on friday ran a lengthy frontpage story 
describing negroponte as a diplomat who has earned a reputation 
for being more astute and calculating than machiavelli 
the liberal daily la jornada called negropontes appointment an 
ominous decision and compared him unfavorably to former ambassador 
john gavin who was extremely unpopular in mexico city 
la jornada also began a threepart series thursday on negroponte 
called the path of an ultrahawk 
negroponte began his diplomatic career in hong kong in the early 
1960s he served in the us embassy in saigon during the vietnam 
war and was a member of the us negotiating team at the paris peace 
talks on that conflict 
later negroponte served at the us embassy in quito ecuador 
and was a consul general in greece

retired us supreme court justice 
lewis f powell jr was resting comfortably in a hospital after 
being admitted for an acute respiratory infection 
he has a relatively minor illness that has lingered for a few 
days an acute respiratory infection a cold really said dr 
joel p schrank chief of cardiology at baptist medical center 
there is some suspicion that he might have a little 
pneumonia and results of tests to determine that should be known 
sometime today schrank said 
powell 81 was listed in stable condition early today said 
cindy hamilton a hospital spokeswoman 
the former associate justice was taken to baptist medical center 
by ambulance shortly before noon monday after feeling dizzy while 
working at the federal courthouse in jacksonville 
powell had some minor abnormalities on his electrocardiogram and 
was placed on a heart monitor as a precaution schrank said 
the physician refused to speculate on how long powell should 
remain in the hospital 
the best thing for him would be a little rest and a little 
time the doctor said 
powell was in jacksonville as a visiting judge on a threejudge 
panel of the 11th us circuit court of appeals 
chief circuit judge paul roney said powell developed a cold 
during the weekend and began feeling worse monday he said he and 
another judge would still hear oral arguments as a quorum of the 
court by taping the sessions 
powell retired from the high court june 26 1987 citing concerns 
about his health as one reason he had suffered from prostate cancer 
powell took senior status when he stepped down and has since 
participated in several cases for the richmondbased 4th us 
circuit court of appeals 
in a recent conversation with a reporter powell said he had been 
invited to act as a visiting judge in at least 10 of the 13 federal 
appeals courts 
when asked why he chose the 11th circuit court he laughed and 
answered because i get to go to florida in february 
powell and his wife josephine have homes in richmond and 
washington his wife was with him in jacksonville 
during his 14year supreme court tenure powell avoided the rigid 
ideology that at times isolated the courts liberal and conservative 
wings 
he was 64 when nominated by president richard nixon in 1971 and 
was sworn in jan 7 1972 replacing liberal justice hugo l black 
before joining the court powell practiced trial law for 34 years 
in his hometown of richmond except for service during world war ii 
he also served as president of the american bar association from 
1964 to 1965 and the american college of trial lawyers in 1969

the government and the opposition sat down 
at the same table to seek a common course for polands future but 
solidarity chairman lech walesa cautioned that deep distrust hangs 
over the historic talks 
fiftyseven delegates of divergent views sat at a specially built 
circular table under the glare of television lights for mondays 
remarkable opening session 
opposition activists faced officials who had interned them during 
the 1981 crackdown that suppressed solidarity debating conditions 
for the free trade union movements reinstatement and a possible 
opposition role in government 
it was first time since the communists consolidated power after 
world war ii with soviet backing that a crosssection of the 
opposition had begun formal talks with authorities over how to run 
poland and salvage an economy in crisis 
delegates representing the opposition the communist party the 
government and the influential roman catholic church met for about 
three hours and agreed to break up into three working groups 
beginning wednesday 
one group will discuss economic and social policy one trade 
unions and the third political reforms according to a joint 
statement issued after the session at the council of ministers 
palace 
opposition spokesmen have said they expect the real work of the 
negotiations to take place in these groups and to last about six 
weeks 
if a grand compromise is reached it could be quickly enacted 
into law by the communistdominated parliament 
the chief official at the talks was politburo member and interior 
minister gen czeslaw kiszczak a key player in the 1981 crackdown 
walesa led a 25member group representing solidarity and other 
opposition groups 
kiszczak said ending the sevenyear ban on solidarity is possible 
only if the talks produce broad agreement on political and economic 
reform 
if we work out at the round table and officially announce to 
society a confirmed consensus on the idea of nonconfrontational 
elections as well as support for planned political and economic 
reforms there will be an immediate possibility to lift the ban 
he said 
the authorities have indicated they are willing to allow the 
opposition seats in parliament as a minority party but the 
opposition does not believe the communists have any intention of 
sharing power 
walesa seemed to be advocating quick legalization 
we demand solidarity we have the right to it he said in a 
blunt speech immediately following kiszczaks 
authorities agreed in advance that the talks could result in 
reinstating solidarity in exchange they seek an opposition 
endorsement of painful reforms that could increase prices and lead 
to layoffs if outmoded plants are closed 
many government opponents are wary of the offer 
this table is surrounded by social hope but also distrust 
said walesa there will be people who will not accept what we work 
out here we must know this and accept this 
walesa quoted by the state pap news agency blamed the countrys 
economic and political crisis on the lack of freedoms 
we know the country is in ruins but it has not been ruined by 
gnomes but by a power structure that has deprived people of their 
rights and wasted the fruits of their labor walesa said 
the time of social and political monopoly is ending we need a 
restructuring that will turn the oneparty state into a state of the 
nation and the society he said 
solidarity says it wants to discuss reform of the legal system to 
create a more independent judiciary freedom of clubs and 
associations access to the mass media democratization of local 
government at smaller round tables 
the talks were given heavy television coverage and the communist 
party daily newspaper trybuna ludu printed an extra edition monday 
night about the meeting which kiszczak first proposed in august as 
a way of ending the countrys worst labor turmoil since solidaritys 
heyday 
the economic crisis has spawned 60 percent inflation and chronic 
consumer shortages poland is trying to cope with a 39 billion 
foreign debt an obsolete industrial base and the exodus of talented 
young people to the west 
government spokesman jerzy urban told a news conference after 
mondays talks that authorities were satisfied with the start the 
speeches showed a rather convergent way of thinking about the 
future and about the changes necessary in poland he said 
solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said his hopes have 
brightened 
yesterday i said that i was a moderate optimist today i can 
say i am still a moderate optimist but a little bit more of one 
he said in an interview on staterun television that would have been 
unthinkable a few months ago

saying hes had enough of retirement and was saddled up and ready 
to ride again for a balanced federal budget and repeal of the 
twoterm presidency 
the 40th presidents birthday celebration monday included an 
office chat with japanese prime minister noboru takeshita a 
blacktie party and a speech to students at the university of 
southern california where he was serenaded by the usc marching band 
one of my biggest disappointments as president was i wasnt 
able to balance the budget reagan told the college audience 
reagan received extended applause when answering a question about 
overthecounter military weapons such as the ak47 assault rifle 
used to gun down five stockton schoolchildren last month 
i do not believe in taking away the right of the citizen for 
sporting for hunting and so forth or for home defense he said 
but i do believe that an ak47 a machine gun is not a sporting 
weapon or needed for defense of a home 
the speech was reagans first public event since a spirited 
welcome home airport rally jan 20 the day he relinquished the 
presidency to george bush the former president said he does not 
relish retirement 
two weeks ago i went into retirement boy am i glad thats 
over said reagan 
i dont like retirement it took all the fun out of saturdays 
for two weeks i tried to adjust to private life and growing old 
gracefully but thats not my style here i am saddled up and ready 
to ride again 
earlier monday the visiting japanese prime minister paid a 
30minute courtesy call on reagan at the former presidents 
34thfloor century city office 
on monday night comedian bob hope actor jimmy stewart and other 
members of hollywoods elite helped reagan and his wife nancy 
celebrate his birthday at the posh bistro garden in beverly hills 
were all here to wish him the best hope said before 
entering the private party 
the president who joked it was the 39th anniversary of his 39th 
birthday said his wish was that ill have a lot more 
guests at the celebration included two of reagans inner circle 
in government former secretary of state george shultz and former 
attorney general william french smith also among the approximately 
100 guests were mca inc chief lew wasserman texas oilman marvin 
davis actress eva gabor and entertainment tycoon merv griffin 
the menu was roast chicken with baby carrots asparagus and 
noisette potatoes the prelude to the meal included rigatoni with 
salami ham bacon black and green olives and italianstyle sauce 
the birthday desert was chocolate tartuffo ice cream and lemon 
cake 
in his 22minute address at usc reagan outlined some of his 
political work for the future 
today i start stumping for our future president republican or 
democrat to bring government under control he said we dont 
have a deficit because the people arent taxed enough we have a 
deficit because the congress spends too much 
he criticized the constitutional amendment that limits 
presidential terms to two 
the 22nd amendment is politically motivated and it should be 
repealed reagan said two times isnt necessarily enough time 
to get all you want done done i still had things to do when i 
left 
about a dozen demonstrators staged a brief protest outside the 
auditorium most of them decrying reagans stance against abortion 
the protesters were countered by members of the campus young

anger and suspicion arising from the 
death of a young black in police custody have led to seven straight 
days of protest marches and a vow to continue pressuring authorities 
for a thorough investigation 
a group of 60 blacks started out in manahan village a lowincome 
housing project and marched peacefully through the business 
district of this affluent northern new jersey township monday night 
chanting we want justice and carrying placards criticizing the 
police 
marchers said before the onehour rally that they wanted to be a 
visible reminder of dissatisfaction with the inquiry into the death 
of john tony jackson 22 
jackson was wellknown in the closeknit manahan village 
community protesters said his death has been linked to possible 
drug abuse but marchers contend rough handling by police may have 
caused the death of the asthma sufferer 
the marches have been peaceful unlike recent racial disturbances 
in miami and tampa fla stemming from the deaths of blacks during 
encounters with police 
similar disturbances have touched new jersey in recent months in 
perth amboy hispanics demonstrated their anger for two nights in 
june after a mexican man was shot and killed by an offduty police 
officer 
in an effort to defuse tension in morristown a town of about 
16500 people us justice department mediators are looking into 
jacksons death at the mayors request the mayor and police chief 
have met separately with marchers but protesters who have 
participated in all seven marches said monday they do not trust 
local authorities 
its nothing racial its just justice said louan mccoy one 
of the marchers 
a life was taken while in the custody of police said another 
marcher gwen king regardless of color a life has been taken 
an autopsy showed jackson had cocaine and opiates in his system 
when he died on jan 28 officials say preliminary tests also 
showed no signs of physical trauma to the body 
the autopsy did not reveal a cause of death and a final 
toxicological report will be finished within eight weeks said the 
state medical examiners office protesters say they are willing to 
march during that time 
were going to march as long as it takes said frank osborne 
the victims uncle and organizer of the rallies 
police chief robert white and mayor david manahan on monday 
praised the orderliness and discipline of the marches but said 
there was little they could do to satisfy the participants 
before jacksons arrest on a traffic warrant he ran from police 
and was caught after bumping into an officer near a house in manahan 
village where he lived authorities say 
police said they found jackson with a small amount of cocaine and 
marijuana and an asthma inhalator shortly after he was handcuffed 
jackson complained of shortness of breath police said witnesses 
have said he cried out for help and soon after collapsed 
police took him to morristown hospital where he was pronounced 
dead 
police were aware of the asthma white said a quick 
decision was made to take him to the hospital i find no fault with 
that decision 
protesters say the police were inattentive and questioned why an 
ambulance was not summoned they say the case is typical of the 
towns treatment of blacks 
the mayor who met with marchers friday said he understands the 
resentment of blacks which he attributes partially to economic and 
housing discrimination in the town but he said they are wrong to 
accuse police of impropriety 
i really believe having read the autopsy report that the 
police did everything by the book said manahan whose brother 
developed the housing project protesters have picked the wrong 
case im not saying the police havent roughed up black people 
here but they picked the wrong case

californias wage policies toward its female 
employees in the 1930s are being debated anew as lawyers for 60000 
to 70000 women try to prove deliberate bias in state pay scales 
a federal court trial scheduled to open today may determine 
whether there is any legal life left in the doctrine of comparable 
worth or equal pay for different jobs of similar value 
but lawyers for the women are disavowing that label and describe 
their case as one of simple sex discrimination 
the california state employees association contends the state 
adopted a deliberate policy of paying less for femaledominated jobs 
in state service in 1931 and has preserved the effects of that 
policy to this day state lawyers deny such a policy ever existed 
but say any taint was removed when job classifications were 
reorganized in 193738 
us district judge marilyn hall patel hearing the case without 
a jury is limiting testimony in the first phase of the trial to the 
intent and effects of state policies in the 1930s 
if the union can prove deliberate discrimination later phases 
will examine recent wage practices with potential damages of more 
than 100 million for women in femaledominated state jobs since 
1977 
the csea suit filed in 1984 ran into a huge obstacle the next 
year in a ruling by the 9th us circuit court of appeals which 
covers california and eight other western states 
overturning the nations first statewide comparable worth 
verdict the court ruled that the state of washington could follow 
prevailing market wages in paying less to workers in 
femaledominated jobs 
the opinion by judge anthony m kennedy now a supreme court 
justice said a decision to pay unequal market wages did not 
constitute the type of intentional discrimination needed for such a 
suit 
the california employees group claims it has found the evidence 
needed to survive the appeals court ruling a policy of sexbased 
salarysetting in state government dating back to 1931 
the state has never relied primarily on prevailing rates in 
setting salaries the union said in court papers 
wage discrimination on the basis of sex was the states 
standard operating procedure during the early 1930s and the 
effects of such discrimination carry over to the present day 
so far the unions strategy has succeeded in keeping the case in 
court patel has ruled that the claims of intentional discrimination 
in salarysetting if proved would be grounds for awarding damages 
but patel a former lawyer for the national organization for 
women has indicated skepticism about the employees associations 
claims that it can prove a link between the alleged discrimination 
of the early 1930s and later pay policies

three out of four israeli jews oppose the 
formation of a palestinian state and four out of five say such a 
state would threaten israels security according to a public 
opinion poll released today 
the results indicate a slight thaw in israeli attitudes toward a 
palestinian state a similar survey conducted a decade ago found 
that nine out of 10 opposed the formation of a palestinian state and 
believed it would threaten israel 
the current survey conducted by the israel institute of applied 
social research asked a nationwide sample of 1192 israeli jews if 
they would accept or oppose the establishment of a palestinian 
state 
seventyseven percent said they would oppose a separate 
palestinian state and 23 percent said they would accept it 
in a second question the institute asked do you believe a 
palestinian state on the west bank would threaten or not threaten 
the security of the state of israel 
about 80 percent said such a state would be threatening 
its still a very high number but there is a certain thawing 
which is very slow but in a dovish direction said elihu katz 
director of the private institute 
the survey was conducted last month and involved jews 20 years 
and older katz said he said it was the latest in a series begun in 
1967 when israel seized the west bank and gaza strip from jordan 
and egypt in the middle east war 
katz said the institute does not officially quote a margin of 
error for its surveys but estimated it to be in a range of 3 to 5 
percent

corporal the same punishment given last week to another sergeant in 
the death of lance cpl jason rother

charge of failure to obey a lawful order and a lesser charge of 
unauthorized absence 
im just glad it wasnt any harder on my family turnell said 
as he left court 
the military jury deliberated about two hours before returning 
the verdict 
turnell was accused of failing to follow the policies of his unit 
by being absent without authorization for two days during rothers 
disappearance he also was accused of negligence for failing to 
account for the whereabouts and welfare of rother 19 of 
minneapolis who was a member of turnells squad 
rother was left behind after being posted as a road guide for an 
exercise at twentynine palms calif on aug 30 his remains were 
not found until december 
turnells superior sgt christopher clyde was found guilty of 
negligence last week for allowing turnell special time off and for 
failing to account for his men 
in testimony monday at turnells trial clyde acknowledged having 
given turnell permission to take two days liberty 
in closing arguments capt robert nunally the prosecutor told 
the jury that turnell was only concerned with his two days off not 
the whereabouts of rother 
if he had cared or asked one question maybe we wouldnt be 
here today nunally said 
but turnells civilian attorney guy garand said the 
disappearance was not entirely the fault of his client 
there are many people who are responsible for this incident 
garand said he said there was poor communication in the entire 
company a reflection of poor leadership

barbara tuchman was remembered upon her 
death as the popular historian whose 1962 the guns of august 
reminded the superpowers of the dangers of diplomatic miscalculation 
as they teetered on the brink 
the twotime pulitzer prize winner and author of 11 books 
including the current best seller the first salute died monday 
at a hospital in greenwich following a stroke she was 77 
the guns of august had a tremendous impact on president 
kennedy and all who went through the cuban missile crisis said 
william manchester author of the death of a president and 
writerinresidence at wesleyan university in middletown 
tuchmans the first salute a look at the american revolution 
and the dutch revolution that preceded it by 200 years has been on 
the new york times bestseller list for 17 weeks 
she said last fall it would be her last book because of failing 
eyesight 
tuchman won the pulitzer for history for the guns of august 
in 1962 and stilwell and the american experience in china in 
1971 the latter work was hailed as brilliant by americas 
preeminent china scholar john k fairbank of harvard university 
in 1978 she was awarded the gold medal for history of the 
american academy and institute of arts and letters 
she also wrote the proud tower a story of europe before 
world war i and a distant mirror the calamitous 14th century 
which traces the tumult of the period by following the career of a 
feudal lord 
the guns of august which established her reputation 
examined how the military buildup in europe led the great powers to 
bungle their way into world war i 
it was a favorite of president kennedy because of its lessons for 
leaders in the nuclear age said historian arthur schlesinger jr a 
kennedy adviser kennedy presented a copy of the book to british 
prime minister harold macmillan 
what he felt was that the guns of august was a clear 
demonstration of the extent that miscalculation got people into 
war schlesinger said in a telephone interview 
writer john hersey who worked with tuchman on the issues of 
censorship and freedom of speech for the authors league called the 
book a kind of parable for our times to make us realize where 
some of our policies might lead us 
tuchman was born jan 30 1912 in new york city and graduated 
from radcliffe college in 1933 she lived in greenwich 
she expressed pride in the fact that she never gained an advanced 
degree and was not an academic saying during an interview last fall 
that a phd would have ruined me 
although some professional historians criticized some of her work 
as shallow others praised her as a writer whose broad scope and 
lively style made history exciting for the general reading public 
the guns of august was a superb book said john m blum 
sterling professor of history at yale university it would have 
been a very picayune professional historian who had any objections 
to it 
as an historian i belong to the how rather than the why 
school tuchman wrote in an autobiographical sketch i am a 
seeker of the small facts not the big explanation a narrator not a 
philosopher 
with each book i approached nearer as i hope to my goal of 
presenting history as literature 
tuchman began her career as an editorial assistant and occasional 
correspondent for the nation which her father investment banker 
maurice wertheim bought in 1935 to save from bankruptcy she 
covered president roosevelts 1936 campaign and the spanish civil 
war

discoverys five astronauts completed 
a successful practice countdown in the spaceship today as 
technicians worked to replace three engine pumps in time to meet a 
midmarch launch date nasa said 
wearing bulky space suits the crew of the 28th shuttle mission 
entered the cabin for the final two hours of the rehearsal which 
concluded at 1137 am 37 minutes late because of minor 
communications and computer problems 
everything appears to have been successful for todays terminal 
countdown demonstration test said nasa spokeswoman lisa malone 
the countdown test which began sunday duplicated much of the 
actual count except that the fuel tank was not loaded and some 
procedures were shortened 
discovery was powered up and its electronic communications and 
other systems were checked the communications satellite to be 
deployed by the crew was loaded in the cargo bay on monday 
as the countdown progressed technicians at the base of the 
launch pad continued removing the oxygen turbopumps from discoverys 
three main engines the first was pulled monday and the second came 
out early today 
they will be replaced as a precaution because of two tiny cracks 
discovered in the shuttle atlantis after its flight in december 
discovery has identical pumps 
the repairs delayed the launch from feb 23 until march 10 at the 
earliest officials said last week that if discovery could not get 
off the only available launch pad by march 18 the mission might 
have to be delayed for months 
thats because the next shuttle mission that of atlantis must 
take place between april 28 and may 28 in order for its crew to 
dispatch the magellan spacecraft to orbit venus which will not come 
into proper position again until 1991 
astronaut mike coats commander of the discovery mission said 
monday he is confident about a midmarch launch 
we were discouraged about a week ago because the first 
analysis indicated it might take too long a time to get the new 
pumps and that there would be no way we could launch in march he 
said now everybody weve talked to is very optimistic were 
confident theyve got a good fix on it now 
arnold aldrich nasa national space transportation system 
director said in washington on monday he is certain of launching 
discovery without affecting the atlantis launch

two men arrested in the killing of a 
nicaraguan rebel commander admitted to roles in the assassination 
and one of them said the killing was planned by the nicaraguan 
embassy in honduras 
nicaragua today denied the accusation 
luis fernandez ordonez reyes one of three men under arrest in 
the case said monday that he was a gobetween for the nicaraguan 
embassy security chief and a former honduran police officer accused 
in the jan 7 killing of manuel rugama a commander of the 
nicaraguan rebels known as contras 
the plan to eliminate rugama was prepared by the nicaraguan 
embassy in tegucigalpa ordonez said at a news conference 
organized by the honduran military 
luis fernandez ordonez reyes accusations are ridiculous and 
completely removed from the truth the embassy has no security 
chief we deny all involvement by our embassy in the assassination 
of the contra chief nicaraguan embassy spokesman juan jose 
membreno said today by telephone 
the contras have blamed the nicaraguan government for rugamas 
slaying they said rugama was to meet with other contra leaders on 
the day he died 
ordonez identified the nicaraguan embassy security chief as jose 
de jesus pena and said he introduced pena to one of ordonezs 
employees rigoberto matute a former police detective 
ordonez a nicaraguan who operated a money exchange in 
tegucigalpa said pena often visited his business and paid him 
between 500 and 1500 for information about antisandinista rebels 
in honduras 
membreno denied that anyone named jose de jesus pena worked for 
the embassy 
the other man presented at the news conference was juan bautista 
nunez amador 
bautista nunez said matute told him he would pay bautista nunez 
20000 to help in the killing i was the first to fire at 
rugama bautista nunez said 
he said matute and a third man he knew only by the last name cano 
arteaga then joined in killing rugama 
matute bautista nunez and ordonez are being held in the killing 
there was no indication why matute did not attend the news 
conference 
rugama apparently was alone when he was shot as he drove on a 
highway west of the honduran capital officers found his body on the 
road they said he had been shot 26 times 
a doctor rugama had been a contra for nine years and was one of 
the organizations regional commanders

israels response to the palestinian uprising 
in the west bank and gaza strip led to a substantial increase in 
human rights violations the state department said today in its 
annual report on human rights conditions worldwide 
the wideranging study also hailed remarkable changes in the 
soviet union under president mikhail s gorbachev during the past 
year 
the report criticized israeli troops for practices that resulted 
in many avoidable deaths and injuries during the 14month 
uprising 
from time to time since the violence started in the occupied 
territories the state department has expressed criticism of israeli 
efforts to bring it under control but the report appeared to go 
beyond the earlier statements 
the report said israeli authorities in some cases prosecuted or 
took disciplinary action against soldiers or settlers who had killed 
palestinians 
but it added regulations were not rigorously enforced 
punishments were usually lenient and there were many cases of 
unjustified killing that did not result in disciplinary actions or 
prosecutions 
the palestinian uprising which began in december 1987 caught 
the israeli army by surprise the report said the armed forces 
untrained and inexperienced in riot control responded in a manner 
which led to a substantial increase in human rights violations it 
said 
criticism of the israel reaction to the uprising also was raised 
on capitol hill today by the private human rights group amnesty 
international and the lawyers committee for human rights 
in a report to the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations amnesty international said that while both sides have 
used violence in the palestinian uprising which began in december 
1987 there have been excesses on the israeli side 
demonstrators have thrown rocks and molotov cocktails the 
report said however the tactics of the israeli army have 
exceeded the use of reasonable force 
it said there have been hundreds of questionable killings by 
israeli security forces and that few have been adequately 
investigated 
amnesty international and the lawyers committee questioned the 
use of high velocity bullets by the israeli forces as well as the 
use of plastic bullets which the two organizations said can be 
lethal 
citing figures compiled by the press palestinians and the 
israeli government the state department report said 366 
palestinians were killed in 1988 as a result of the uprising most 
of the by the idf israeli defense forces some by israeli 
settlers over 20000 palestinians were wounded or injured by 
the idf 
the report found that 11 israelis had been killed in the uprising 
and approximately 1100 injured 
the 1560page report on conditions in more than 160 nations was 
prepared for submission to congress and public release on wednesday 
however some accounts appeared in newspapers today 
on the changes in the soviet union the report said we still 
cannot say that there has been a fundamental shift in the soviet 
unions approach to human rights but there is no doubt that the 
changes in evidence in 1988 have profound implications as advocates 
of significant systemic reform appear to have gained strength 
by the end of 1988 all soviet citizens who had been punished for 
political dissent or unauthorized religious activity had been set 
free the report said it added that plans for amendment or repeal 
of statutes limiting political and religious activity have been 
announced and that the practice of placing political dissidents in 
mental hospitals is being curbed 
elsewhere the report cited significant further advances in 
hungary and poland toward a more open society and added that the 
october plebiscite in chile generated hope that for a peaceful 
return to democracy in that country 
the report said that some of the most significant human rights 
violations took place in iraq burundi and sudan 
in each of these situations innocent civilian bystanders died 
as a result of guerrilla warfare or reprisals for violence by 
others it said 
it accused iraq of employing chemical warfare against kurdish 
rebels killing and injuring thousands of civilians and causing tens 
of thousands to flee 
an estimated 5000 to 10000 civilians were killed during ethnic 
violence in burundi in east africa

a soccer club on tuesday won the 
right to advertise condoms on its jerseys 
the frankfurt civil court ruled that the ads on the shirts of the 
fc homburg soccer team dont represent an ethical violation 
the case went to court after the west german soccer federation 
ruled last fall that fc homburg was violating the basic principles 
of ethics and morals in sport by advertising the brand name of the 
london condom company on its uniforms 
but in its decision in favor of the team the court ruled against 
that saying morals have fundamentally changed in the past two 
decades 
the court also cited a federal health ministry campaign promoting 
the use of condoms for safer sex the court said the health ministry 
advertising was much more direct in promoting condoms than the team 
the ruling will permit the fc homburg players to wear the 
jerseys which are inscribed with the brand name of the condoms 
outlined by a double circle the word condom does not appear 
german soccer jerseys already advertise electronics goods dairy 
goods and other products

a friend of navajo tribal chairman peter 
macdonald sr said today he paid macdonald thousands of dollars in 
cash and gifts for arranging purchase of a 750000acre ranch and 
that the chief participated in a coverup of the transaction 
byron t bud brown testified before a special senate 
committee that macdonald asked him for 25000 and a 55000 bmw 
automobile in exchange for arranging an inflated purchase price for 
the big boquillas ranch 
testifying with immunity from criminal prosecution brown told of 
being wired by investigators in order to tape conversations he had 
with macdonald about the coverup he said the coverup scheme began 
after an investigation of the ranch sale by the local us attorney 
brown arranged for the ranch to be purchased from tenneco corp 
for 262 million by businessman tom tracy and then sold immediately 
to the navajos for 33 million under the deal tracy brown and 
macdonald split the 72 million profit brown testified 
a portion of the macdonald payment was made in 5000 cash 
increments by brown he said the coverup involved a 25000 
payment and the bmw car brown said 
on monday peter macdonald jr recounted the same story to the 
committee which is a special panel of the senate select committee 
on indian affairs the coverup called for the junior macdonald to 
be the recipient of the 25000 and the car as a way of protecting 
his father he testified 
the junior macdonald also testified under immunity his father 
has not testified nor has he been told that he would get immunity if 
he did testify the committee staff said 
the senior macdonalds involvement in the ranch sale is being 
investigated by a grand jury in arizona there also is a movement 
underway by the navajos to remove the senior macdonald from his 
55000ayear job as chairman on the 
a senate investigator eugene twardowicz gave the committee 
documents monday showing that the purchasers of the land had 
incurred expenses in 1987 including the 25000 loan to the 
chairman a 4000 down payment for the leased car and two 900 
monthly installments for the automobile 
the younger macdonald said he his father and brown met about 
five times in 1988 to work out their story that macdonald jr had 
sought the loan and the car 
macdonald jr 33 said allowing it to appear that macdonald sr 
sought the money and the car looked bad since brown was 
involved in the boquillas deal he said it was his father who asked 
him to go ahead with the coverup 
asked by committee counsel kenneth ballen why he allowed himself 
to become involved in the concocted story macdonald jr said 
because i love my father 
a senate investigator who asked to not be identified said 
planning to give a false story to authorities is illegal and could 
qualify as obstruction of justice obstruction of a congressional 
investigator and conspiring to commit perjury 
brown and tracy purchased the ranch for 262 million in july 
1987 from the tenneco west co brown also received a 750000 
commission from tenneco the two men then sold the land to the 
navajo tribe for 334 million either the same day or a day or two 
later according to twardowicz 
twardowicz said that based on his investigation of the finances 
of brown and tracy he believed the men could not have afforded to 
buy the land from tenneco unless they knew they would soon sell it 
to the tribe 
they had to know they coul flip when i say flip i mean 
resell it for a much higher amount which they did said 
twardowicz 
brown received 59 percent of the sales profits and tracy got 41 
percent according to a copy of the agreement between the two men 
that twardowicz gave the committee the deal netted brown 5 million 
and tracy 3 million twardowicz said 
the investigator told the committee that brown paid for a 
november 1986 trip to hawaii that macdonald took with his family 
shortly after he was reelected chairman of the navajo 
twardowicz also said brown signed a oneyear 5500permonth 
consulting contract with macdonald jr the chairmans son said that 
agreement was merely a part of the coverup designed to make browns 
loan more plausible 
sen john mccain rariz a committee member said the land deal 
was a questionable if not fraudulent transaction 
another panel member sen dennis deconcini dariz said in 
essence the navajo people paid 8 million more than they had to 
assuming they wanted the property in the first place 
the committee launched its hearings last week following reports 
of alleged fraud in the arizona republic 
the panel has come under criticism by indians for aiming its 
probe at accusations against navajo leaders rather than problems 
within the bureau of indian affairs and other government agencies 
richie nez macdonald srs chief of staff who was attending the 
hearing told reporters afterward that this was a normal real 
estate transaction and that the navajo thought the 33 million 
acquisition was a good one 
asked if the alleged favors influenced the tribes decision to 
buy the land he said i cant comment on that

confirmation hearings for cabinet nominee louis 
sullivan who put out a potential brush fire by deciding to forfeit 
nearly 300000 from his medical school presidency will begin 
thursday the white house said today 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said the fbi had 
completed its background check of the secretarydesignate of health 
and human services and found no adverse information as far as we 
know he said the white house expects sullivan will be confirmed 
the administration had asked congress on monday to set a new date 
for sullivans hearing a sign that it was satisfied with the 
nominees financial disclosure and fbi background investigation 
a hearing scheduled last week by the senate finance committee had 
been postponed after the white house asked for a delay citing 
incomplete financial information from the nominee and an unfinished 
fbi background check 
but sullivans decision to take an unpaid leave of absence and 
forgo 297000 in severance pay from morehouse school of medicine in 
atlanta the school he founded and heads as president put his 
hearing back on track and earned him praise on capitol hill 
sen lloyd bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance 
committee said sullivans decision shows a major personal 
commitment to public service 
sen ted stevens ralaska said he admired sullivan for not 
taking the money but he said people should not be pressured to give 
up money to which they are legally entitled 
we have so much pressure in the government only those born 
with two gold spoons in their mouth will be able to serve around 
here pretty soon he said it is impossible for me to understand 
this pressure that comes on people who were not born wealthy and who 
have earned a certain right 
the white house had told sullivan that if he cut his ties with 
morehouse he could accept 297000 in severance pay under terms of 
his contract with the school and sullivan was prepared to do that 
according to a senior administration official who spoke on the 
condition of anonymity 
but the nominee became concerned when news reports cast the 
arrangement in an unfavorable light and raised questions about 
potential conflicts of interest since morehouse receives federal 
funds from hhs the officials said 
sullivan felt he was taking a beating in the press decided 
on balance it was just not worth it and told morehouse he would 
forfeit the severance pay the official said instead he would 
resign as president and take an unpaid leave of absence as a 
professor of medicine 
as president of morehouse sullivan earned an annual salary of 
172000 as head of the largest federal department he will make 
99500 a payraise measure that was headed for defeat in congress 
today was to raise that to 155000 
sullivan who wants to keep his house in atlanta while he is in 
washington plans to borrow money while his wife a lawyer plans to 
go back to work so they can make ends meet the official said 
the official said sullivan simply accepted this as unfortunate 
but this is a cost of becoming part of the government 
though sullivans decision to forgo the money surprised many in 
the nations capital ethics officials say it is not unusual for 
people entering government to give up large sums of money due them 
from former employers 
there are government people who give up unbelievable sums to 
take government positions because they are afraid it could 
create a problem for them said don campbell deputy director of 
the office of government ethics 
however others at sullivans level do take large sums from 
former employers including deferred income that was earned 
before they came to the government 
for example the new agriculture secretary clayton k yeutter 
last year while he was us trade representative received 561602 
from the chicago mercantile exchange for an annual installment for 
deferred earnings plus the aftertax proceeds of a lump sum 
distribution yeutter had been president of the exchange before 
joining the reagan cabinet 
sullivan however feared that the controversy over a paid leave 
in the wake of an outcry by conservative lawmakers over his 
statements on abortion and the fbis focus on his connection to a 
georgia politician convicted of extortion could affect his 
reputation and the credibility of the bush administration the 
administration official said

foreign minister luis maria argana said 
today he will urge the official colorado party to endorse coup 
leader andres rodriguez for president in the national elections set 
for may 1 
argana who had been considered a frontrunner for the office 
said at a news conference that he backed my friend gen 
rodriguez who on friday ousted dictator gen alfredo stroessner 
there was no immediate response from rodriguez 
asked monday if he might be a candidate rodriguez said it is 
every paraguayans duty to serve his country being president is a 
great honor if i am called to serve i will 
colorado party officials plan to hold a convention to select 
candidates for president the 72member house of deputies and the 
36member senate 
opposition leaders many of whom were exiled during stroessners 
presidency and whose parties were banned have asked that the 
election be delayed to give them time to prepare argana ruled that 
out 
the period of time is imposed by the national constitution and 
is the maximum he said the opposition itself has no interest 
in extending the deadline because by extending the deadline we also 
extend the arrival of democracy 
on monday rodriguez issued a decree dissolving congress 
he said the new government would serve until august 1993 the 
term of office for elections that were held in february 1988 only 
the communist party would be banned from fielding candidates 
rodriguez said 
rodriguez at his news conference monday denied rumors that he 
is involved in drug trafficking saying they were spread by people 
trying to defame me 
he said paraguay reputedly a major transit point for cocaine 
would crack down on narcotics trafficking and cooperate in 
international antidrug campaigns including those of the us drug 
enforcement administration 
rodriguez also denied reports that as many as 300 people died the 
coup he said the dead and wounded together did not exceed 50 
he promised democratic reforms shortly after taking power friday 
but the opposition expressed skepticism about his hasty calling of 
elections 
i personally cant even be a candidate for anything because im 
not registered to vote said domingo laino a former political 
exile and leader of what is thought to be paraguays biggest 
opposition group the authentic radical liberal party 
our people are not registered either he said because 
stroessner outlawed the party 
stroessner now in exile in brazil ruled paraguay for nearly 35 
years after seizing power in a 1954 coup 
laino suggested the may 1 election date could be interpreted as 
a trap set by the colorado party which after 41 years in power is 
rich and wellorganized 
he also said one solution to the voter registration problem would 
be to instead use the national identity card that all citizens are 
required to carry 
in setting the election date rodriguez cited a constitutional 
clause stating that in the event of a presidents resignation 
incapacitating illness or death the provisional president must call 
for elections within three months 
the governments position is that stroessner resigned 
the colorado party with 14 million members counts on an 
extensive political machine that extends to the smallest towns in 
the countryside 
the electoral code mandates that the party that gets the most 
votes is entitled to twothirds majority in the house and senate

working to improve the water supply in a 
remote guatemalan village isnt everybodys dream honeymoon but it 
suited bud philbrook and michele gran and a decade later the 
rewards from their efforts are still spreading 
the newlywed couple in 1979 spent half their twoweek honeymoon 
in san miguel de conacaste a farming village of 1300 people 
helping to prepare a brochure describing the villages development 
efforts and a loan proposal for an irrigation system 
from that small beginning grew global volunteers a nonprofit 
organization with projects in guatemala mexico jamaica and 
tanzania and plans to begin working in a village in india this 
summer 
the organization will sponsor 18 trips to the five countries this 
year bringing 170 to 200 volunteers from around the united states 
to work for up to three weeks on projects the villagers in each 
country have selected 
we do whatever it is the villagers ask us to do they decide 
what gets done said philbrook a st paul attorney we put 
ourselves at their service but we work hand in hand on the 
project 
though the work can be hot and the hours long volunteers are 
finding such projects a welcome alternative to traditional 
vacations costs of the trips ranging from 1150 to 2800 for the 
various sites are tax deductible if a volunteer doesnt take extra 
time away from the group for pleasure 
the volunteers come at the invitation of host organizations such 
as churches or government agencies in each country and global 
volunteers tries to send groups to each of the villages four times a 
year philbrook said 
for many people a peace corps commitment of two years is too 
long philbrook said global volunteers gives those people a 
chance to contribute in a developing nation without giving up their 
lives at home 
the program is open to anyone and volunteers need not speak the 
native language volunteers have ranged in age from 15 to 73 
there are no skill requirements weve learned that everybody 
here can make a contribution philbrook said 
volunteers have planted trees dug trenches for water pipes and 
worked with farmers identifying crop diseases and demonstrating more 
effective ways of applying fertilizers health care professionals on 
the trips have gone with local nurses to make house calls on 
patients 
were very cognizant about the issue of dependency were not 
creating dependency philbrook stressed we never take control 
its never our project its always their project 
terri hudoba who traveled to jamaica with global volunteers in 
november 1984 and december 1986 said she made her first trip partly 
out of the old 60s hippy guilt feeling of social 
responsibilities 
hudoba who works in the minnesota house of representatives 
information office and is now on the 40member global volunteers 
board spent her time in the jamaican village of woburn lawn helping 
villagers with paperwork necessary to set up a coffee farm hauling 
concrete blocks to a school construction site and working on bylaws 
for a new cooperative being set up in a nearby village 
those experiences have affected her reactions to poverty and 
strife at home and when she takes pleasure vacations 
the people have faces to me now when i go on other vacation 
trips that has a profound impact on me said hudoba adding that 
she is more sensitive to the way we deal with socalled 
minorities at home 
nancy hall who traveled to guatemala with global volunteers in 
april 1988 and will make her second trip in march worked with picks 
and shovels to level land for a central plaza in san miguel de 
conacaste where global volunteers also has helped villagers fix up 
a building for their preschool program 
the kids are so precious im just dying to get down there and 
see them again hall said the hope is in the children

discoverys astronauts boarded their 
space shuttle in a countdown rehearsal tuesday as technicians made 
progress in removing suspect turbopumps from the crafts engines 
commander michael coats and his four crew members entered the 
cabin for the final two hours of the twoday simulation and ran 
through launchday procedures 
everything appears to have been successful said nasa 
spokeswoman lisa malone 
the rehearsal duplicated much of the actual countdown except that 
the fuel tank was not loaded and some procedures were shortened 
discovery was powered up and its electronic and communications 
systems were checked 
meanwhile technicians at the base of the launch pad continued 
removing the oxygen turbopumps from discoverys three main engines 
the first was pulled monday and the second came out tuesday 
nasa said the removal of the third should be completed by 
wednesday two days ahead of schedule 
the pumps will be replaced by new units as a precaution because 
of two tiny cracks discovered in the shuttle atlantis after its 
flight in december discoverys pumps went through the same 
manufacturing process as the cracked one 
the repairs delayed the launch from feb 23 until march 10 at the 
earliest discovery has a march 18 launch deadline because the 
atlantis shuttle mission must take place between april 28 and may 
27 in order for its crew to dispatch the magellan spacecraft to 
orbit venus which will not come into proper position again until 
1991 
arnold aldrich nasa national space transportation system 
director said in washington on monday he is certain of launching 
discovery without affecting the atlantis launch 
discoverys crew is to deploy a communications satellite and 
conduct medical and science experiments during five days in orbit

a suspected japanese terrorist zigzagged 
across 10 states buying bomb parts and visiting a new york office 
building he planned to blow up in retaliation for the 1986 us 
attack on libya authorities said today 
yu kikumura whose sentencing began this morning under extreme 
security was seen by witnesses inside the veterans administration 
building that houses a navy recruiting center in new york city 
state trooper joseph fuentes testified 
the site was marked by felttip pen on a map found inside the 
mans car when the suspected member of the terrorist japanese red 
army was arrested carrying three powerful bombs on the new jersey 
turnpike april 12 authorities said 
kikumaras attorney civil rights lawyer william kuntsler 
objected to the testimony from fuentes a member of the joint state 
and federal terrorism task force saying he should have the right to 
question any eyewitnesses 
but us district judge alfred j lechner jr said such testimony 
was admissable 
kikumura 36 faces up to 100 years in prison for transporting 
and possessing explosives he was convicted nov 29 
investigators said they used hotel and store receipts to track 
kikumuras travels through new york new jersey pennsylvania ohio 
michigan illinois missouri tennessee kentucky and west virginia 
before his arrest 
fbi agent thomas thurman said the bombs would have resulted in 
mass casualties and destruction to the point of the doors being 
blown out chairs and tables in the room would be picked up and 
shattered 
he testified under questioning from us attorney samuel alito 
who was making a rare appearance as the lead prosecutor in the case 
security was tight as kikumura was brought from jail in new york 
city to the courthouse prosecutors said the japanese red army might 
seek to kill him 
authorities closed a lane of the holland tunnel between new york 
and new jersey for 15 minutes in the morning said armando arrastia 
spokesman for the port authority of new york and jersey 
we do it for sensitive vip movements he said we do it for 
people who might be a target of some other group or people who need 
to move through quickly 
extra metal detectors were set up near the courtroom and police 
carried rifles and shotguns as he was led into the courthouse 
alito alleges kikumuras bombing was to have been carried out in 
conjunction with the april 14 1988 attack on a uso club in naples 
italy that killed five people including a us servicewoman 
kikumura was arrested two days before the naples blast which was on 
the second anniversary of the us air strike against libya 
found in his car were 3foot steel canisters packed with 
gunpowder and lead shot electrical fusing devices clocks and 
precision tools authorities said 
his objective was to strike not any person or private group 
but at the united states as a nation alito said in a 
presentencing report 
kunstler and cocounsel ronald kuby said the report makes only 
tenuous ties between their client and other terrorist incidents 
and they asked for a sentence of less than three years in prison

the ranking republican on the senate armed 
services committee said today an fbi report on new allegations 
against defense secretarydesignate john tower does not provide a 
basis for any disqualification 
sen john warner rva told reporters that he was briefed by 
the white house on the report which sources ed on 
new charges of drinking and womanizing and he later briehave said centerfed 
the gop 
members of the committee 
the preliminary report of the investigation which senator sam 
nunn and i requested on thursday has been made available warner 
said it provides at the judgment of white house counsel no 
basis on which senators could find the factual situation that would 
amount to any disqualification 
at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that 
our understanding is the fbi is close to concluding their reports 
and they have found no difficulties or problems that havent been 
resolved 
warner said he has asked that nunn chairman of the panel also 
be briefed and that the full committee assemble to see the fbi 
report the virginia republican said hekground checks delay his addition 
to the cabinet 
bush said at a white house news conference monday that the 
63yearold tower should not have to withdraw his name based on 
unsubstantiated rumors about his personal life 
i think people would not want a person to step aside given 
rumor particularly if the rumor is baseless the president said 
and the problem is the process is taking a little longer than i 
would like and yet i think the senate has got to do what theyre 
doing looking at these allegations very carefully 
bush added however that if any rumors or innuendoes turned out 
to be a substantive allegation of this nature of course it would 
concern me 
warner had said friday that the panel expected to receive the 
final fbi report monday and vote on the tower nomination either 
today or wednesday 
but nunn said monday that the panel had not received a report on 
the new allegations which congressional sources have said deal with 
womanizing and drinking nunn also said that the panel has not 
decided when it will vote on the nomination 
meanwhile committee member sen carl levin dmich when asked 
whether the new allegations centered on a relationship involving 
tower and a russian ballerina who may have been a kgb plant said 
the report had been checked out previously and there was no 
credibility to it 
nunn disputed a statement bush made that the fbi has looked into 
the new allegations and the committee now has the report 
weve done some talking back and forth but weve received no 
report whatsoever he said 
we have not had anything delivered to us and we are awaiting 
on it so the status quo is right where it was nunn said as he 
and warner emerged from a meeting that lasted nearly two hours 
nunn asked about reports that the committee had received new 
allegations about tower said i dont want to get into that 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan not a member of the 
committee said at a news conference that towers confirmation 
chances had probably not been hurt by delay in a vote we should 
get the nomination out dole said 
bush said he fully endorses tower a former texas senator who 
served as chairman of the senate armed services panel but he added 
if somebody comes up with facts i hope im not narrowminded 
enough that i wouldnt take a look but i am not going to deal in 
the kinds of rumors that ive seen reported and then knocked down 
and then reported and then knocked down 
tower meanwhile participated in white house sessions on the 
defense budget both on saturday and again on monday said white 
house spokesman marlin fitzwater

a judge today gave a man the right to 
authorize an abortion on his comatose wife in hopes of helping her 
recover 
state supreme court justice bernard mccaffrey put an immediate 
stay on his ruling until an appeal can be heard this afternoon from 
two antiabortion activists asking to be named legal guardians of 
the woman and the fetus 
the judge granted martin kleins request to be named legal 
guardian for his wife nancy enabling him to authorize an abortion 
on the 32yearold woman 
mrs klein is 17 weeks pregnant and has been in a coma at north 
shore university hospital in manhassett since an auto accident dec 
13 the hospital refused to allow an abortion unless klein was named 
his wifes legal guardian 
during a twoday hearing last week five medical experts for 
klein testified that pregnancy decreases the chances of recovery and 
could threaten mrs kleins life that testimony was contradicted by 
two other medical experts 
based upon the competent medical testimony and records the 
court finds that nancy klein is incapable of communicating and is 
declared to be incompetent and a guardian should be appointed on 
her behalf the judge announced today to a packed courtroom 
if he so determines it be in the best interests of nancy klein 
martin klein may sign on her behalf any and all informed consent 
and authorization forms for an abortion procedure mccaffrey 
continued 
however the judge said that testimony at the hearing convinced 
him an abortion is not medically necessary to preserve the life of 
nancy klein 
two antiabortion activists were to appear before an appellate 
judge this afternoon to request a 24 to 48hour stay until a full 
appeals court can rule on the matter 
kleins attorney sidney schutz said his client was delighted 
with the decision but wished it had been stronger 
klein 34 of upper brookville was accompanied by his inlaws 
frederick and anne zusselman of del ray beach fla who supported 
his motion for guardianship he kissed and embraced his inlaws when 
the ruling was handed down

the air may be cleaner since smoking during 
city council meetings was banned in november but now the need for 
spittoons is growing 
they stopped smoking and people started chewing tobacco said 
mayor charles clarke who smokes two packs a day thats worse 
than smoking you spill that and youve got a mess 
raceland may be the first town to ban smoking in a public 
building in kentucky which is the nations leading producer of 
burley tobacco said ed griffin director of the kentucky municipal 
league in lexington 
there are no plans to regulate tobacco chewing the mayor said 
tuesday two council members are among the chewers who use any 
handy container such as paper cups or soda cans rather than 
oldfashioned spittoons in the council meeting room 
ron morris a regional vice president of the tobacco institute 
based in louisville said he doesnt know of any other towns in 
kentucky that have such policies 
because of the agricultural importance in kentucky it would be 
hard to get a policy in place and keep it morris said 
councilman carl traylor said he made the motion to institute the 
ban for his own health as well as the health of other people taylor 
said he underwent throat cancer surgery dec 30 the former smoker 
said his doctor told him cigarettes were the cause of his cancer 
i was taking radium treatments and i would go to the council 
meetings and i would get sick at my stomach he said my doctor 
asked if there was a lot of smoking he said that could be the cause 
of it 
city clerk connie phelps said the smoke was so bad you could 
cut it with a knife we had windows open and air conditioners on 
nothing helped 
councilman jack barker was the only council member to vote 
against traylors motion which passed nov 8 without discussion

lawyers for oliver north said today the 
irancontra trial of the fired national security council aide should 
be stopped because jury selection procedures have violated the law 
in a court filing north lawyer brendan sullivan said the trial 
should be stayed because the court refused to excuse numerous 
prospective jurors who indicated under questioning that they had 
been exposed to norths 1987 immunized congressional testimony 
us district judge gerhard gesell did not act on the motion 
immediately 
those jurors who were questioned in open court first had stated 
in written questionnaires that they hadnt watched listened to or 
read accounts of norths six days of testimony on capitol hill many 
were accepted for the jury pool over the objection of norths 
lawyers 
norths lawyers said the court violated requirements of the jury 
selection and service act of 1968 
sullivan said the violation of the 1968 law can be remedied 
by excusing all prospective jurors who initially wrote on the 
questionnaire that they hadnt been exposed to the north testimony 
but indicated during open court questioning that they had been 
prior to the filing by norths lawyers the judge added five 
people to the pool of prospective jurors including a man who said 
he tried to put a pillow over his head to avoid hearing anything 
about the case 
the man a supervisor for a security alarm company said he 
recalls nothing about norths immunized congressional testimony in 
1987 
he said this morning when he woke up and knew he would be coming 
in for possible jury selection in the north case he heard 
something i tried to put the pillow over my head to keep from 
listening to a news broadcast about the case north lawyer barry 
simon made no objection to the mans selection 
us district judge gerhard a gesell has instructed all 
potential jurors to avoid listening reading or watching anything 
about the case 
the addition of two men and a woman built the size of the jury 
pool to 41 with 40 the minimum number necessary to pick a jury of 
12 with six alternates 
gesell said he wants at least 44 to choose from in case of 
illness or other lastminute problems 
a district of columbia health inspector also was sent into the 
jury pool after saying that he recalled seeing only little blips 
of news broadcasts on norths congressional testimony simon 
objected to his selection 
a retired key punch operator with eight children was qualified by 
gesell as a prospective juror after she said all she knew about 
north was that i think he flew a plane something about contra 
aid and that north was supposed to have delivered some goods 
overseas in exchange for our hostages she said i dont know 
that the mission was accomplished she also said she saw little 
bits and pieces on the evening news which prompted an objection 
from simon to her selection 
once the pool of prospective jurors is selected the defense may 
challenge 10 of them the prosecution six and each side may 
challenge three of the candidates for the alternate juror posts 
the selection process is in its sixth day in the search for 
prospective jurors who missed or didnt pay attention to norths 
nationally televised congressional testimony 
i expect to be able to put a jury into the box tomorrow 
gesell said after selecting five women and one man monday 
north is accused of shredding evidence and lying to congress to 
cover up the irancontra affair 
after mondays jury selection proceedings gesell held a 
closeddoor hearing at the request of john keker head of the team 
of three prosecutors concerning his classified document 
problems according to a notice issued by the judge 
the national security agency has objected to disclosure of 
classified information in norths trial and took its concerns to the 
justice department government sources have said but attorney 
general dick thornburgh declined to step in on the nsas behalf to 
halt use of the information said the sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity 
last thursday gesell granted intelligence agencies four seats in 
the courtroom but he warned that he wasnt going to let security 
gurus run the north trial 
gesell also denied a request from norths lawyers that the jury 
be isolated for the duration of the trial which could last up to 
five months according to estimates made in the middle of last 
month the judge gave no reason for denying the motion 
north faces 12 criminal charges carrying a maximum of 60 years in 
prison and 3 million in fines if he is convicted on all counts he 
is accused of allegedly concealing from congress in 1985 and 1986 
his efforts on behalf of the nicaraguan contras and of covering up 
from the attorney general the national security councils role in 
diverting money from the reagan administrations iran arms sales to 
the contras 
north also is accused of illegally accepting a 13800 security 
system at his home from codefendant richard secord converting to 
his own use at least 4300 in travelers checks from contra leader 
adolfo calero and conspiring to defraud the treasury of tax revenue 
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the contras

ethnic violence in armenia and azerbaijan killed 91 
people and injured 1650 last year a soviet official said tuesday 
in releasing the highest estimates yet of the human toll of the 
unrest 
the rioting so terrified the armenians and azerbaijanis living in 
each others republics that nearly 300000 people fled their homes 
according to figures reported by the official news agency tass 
quoting maj gen nikolai vasko of the soviet ministry of internal 
affairs 
less than a sixth of those refugees have returned home according 
to vasko that leaves local governments with a massive resettlement 
problem especially in armenia there more than 100000 refugees of 
the ethnic violence have joined 700000 left homeless by the 
devastating dec 7 earthquake 
vasko said only 4000 of the 141000 azerbaijanis who fled have 
returned to their homes in armenia nearly 44000 of the 159000 
armenians who left azerbaijan have returned there he did not 
explain the disparity but the consequences of the earthquake would 
encourage refugees to leave armenia 
previous reports had placed the death toll from the violence at 
more than 70 with 200000 refugees 
christian armenians and moslem azerbaijanis have a long history 
of disputes but they erupted last year with a riot in the 
azerbaijani city of sumgait violence grew with armenian demands for 
a mostly armenian enclave of azerbaijan called nagornokarabakh to 
be turned over to armenian control 
vasko said four soldiers of the internal troops were among those 
killed in the conflict the casualties include 117 troops and 32

a homeless man accused of raping and strangling a 
pregnant doctor at bellevue hospital told detectives he had a second 
victim picked out according to court papers 
steven smith 22 also told a detective that a voice ordered 
him to kill dr kathryn hinnant 33 on jan 7 and that she 
wouldnt have died if he had received psychiatric help according to 
the detectives report 
smith told detective david argenzio that he had to do it and 
that if we hadnt caught him there would have been another 
victim said the report filed in court monday during smiths 
arraignment 
he said there was a girl known to him as viola on the 16th 
floor of bellevue that was his age who could well have been his 
next victim the report said 
smith said he liked the woman but she made him angry according 
to the report 
bellevue officials were unable to determine who that woman might 
have been hospital spokesman jim walsh said today 
we asked around up there nobody knows of any viola he said 
smith pleaded innocent in state supreme court to charges of 
murder rape sodomy and robbery 
argenzio spoke to smith in the waiting room of the psychiatric 
ward of kings county hospital on jan 9 smith said that if someone 
had given him psychiatric help the lady would still be alive 
the detective reported 
smith reportedly told police he came upon ms hinnant while she 
was working late alone in a lab he said he punched her robbed her 
and strangled her with the help of a man named john who then 
raped her 
smith told argenzio that the victim asked him why he was 
attacking her 
he stated to me it was just something i had to do the 
detective reported 
police said fingerprints and other evidence from hinnants office 
indicate smith acted alone 
defense lawyer marvyn kornberg consented to smiths giving hair 
and blood samples for dna genetic fingerprinting tests to 
determine conclusively whether he raped the woman 
dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is a protein molecule found inside 
each cell identifying a persons blood semen or saliva through dna 
is virtually 100 percent accurate because each persons dna pattern 
is unique

irs personnel gave the correct answer on only 
64 percent of telephoned tax queries and government auditors said 
tuesday a major reason was a failure to press questioners for 
details 
a survey by the general accounting office involving 1733 test 
calls during the last returnfiling season also found the irs was 
even less likely to give the right answer on questions affected by 
recent changes in tax law 
irs assistors failure to probe for all of the pertinent facts 
before answering gaos questions was a primary reason for the 36 
percent inaccuracy rate the congressional watchdog agency said in 
a report to congress of 20 test questions 17 required assistors 
to probe to correctly understand and answer the question 
when answers to only those 17 questions are considered the irs 
was wrong 39 percent of the time questions requiring no further 
details produced correct responses 78 percent of the time the gao 
reported 
the gao emphasized that the inaccurary rate applies only to the 
specific questions that were asked and not necessarily to all the 
questions taxpayers are likely to ask however the irss own check 
of actual taxpayer calls last spring indicated its telephone 
personnel provided the correct answer just 724 percent of the time 
irs commissioner lawrence b gibbs in responding to the latest 
gao report said the irs was well into a program to improve the 
skills of the telephone assistors before the current filing 
season 
we have expanded assistor training on probing skills 
gibbs said in addition we continue to emphasize to all managers 
the need for quality review and providing immediate feedback to 
assistors who fail to probe completely 
the irs answered 20 million calls on its 4359 tollfree 
assistance lines last year that represented about 85 percent of the 
direct contact the irs had with taxpayers 
most telephoned questions are answered by frontline 
assistors who often are parttime employees earning 650 to 
1170 an hour if they cannot answer a question they are supposed 
to turn the caller over to a backup assistor who has received more 
training has more reference material close at hand and who is paid 
up to 1432 an hour 
however the gao survey indicated that the backup assistors gave 
the wrong answer to 40 percent of the questions compared with 35 
percent for the frontline employees the gao said that could be 
attributed to the fact the backup assistors had to answer the more 
difficult questions 
other gao findings 
on questions affected by recent tax law changes especially the 
landmark 1986 overhaul the irs gave the right answer to the gao 59 
percent of the time on questions not affected by the changes the 
irs was correct on 72 percent 
48 percent of the gao calls were placed on hold compared with 
52 percent in the earlier survey the average wait was 39 seconds 
down from 55 seconds earlier 
friday was the best day to get through to an assistor monday 
the worst the best time from 7 am to 9 am when the gao got 
through 83 percent of the time on the first try it made little 
difference whether the call was placed in february march or april 
the lowest number of correct responses came on a gao question 
about unreimbursed business expenses only 16 percent of the answers 
were right a question about an individual retirement account was 
answered correctly 19 percent of the time although the gao scored 
an additional 32 percent as correct but incomplete 
a question about charitable contributions was answered correctly 
99 percent of the time the gao found on alimony 98 percent on 
the earnedincome credit 88 percent and on unemployment 
compensation 79 percent of the time

the head of lee countys aids program has 
revealed that he was diagnosed as having aids more than three years 
ago but says hell continue to help his patients as long as he can 
dr adrian pollock 58 who is recovering from a type of 
pneumonia associated with the deadly disease said his decision to 
publicly discuss his health came partly from a desire to make clear 
that he didnt get aids from his patients 
i was reaching a point where i knew id have to go public with 
it said pollock the higher power has a way of doing things his 
way this is when ill find out who my friends are 
pollock who was married and has a daughter said he got the 
disease through homosexual activity the most common means of 
transmission but doesnt know from whom 
i had had a few gay encounters pollock said i guess 
thats the irony of it there were so few but i have no idea when 
or with whom and it doesnt really matter 
pollock director of epidemiology and communicable diseases for 
the county health unit was diagnosed as having aids 3 years ago 
he said one of the things that has kept him going since then is 
the feeling that i am doing something good for other people 
the only thing i know to do is to go ahead and do the best i 
can to help the other people who are facing the same things ive 
faced he said monday 
dr william hill acting director of the county health unit said 
pollocks diagnosis wont keep him from continuing to work 
pollock became ill in december with his first bout of 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia the most common killer of people 
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome which weakens a persons 
immune system and leaves them susceptible to numerous infections 
i went from july into early december with a chronic cough and 
postnasal drip i thought it was just sinusitis its funny how you 
can see things in other people you cant see in yourself pollock 
said i had done just what i tell the patients never to do i 
tapered off on my pentamidine treatments 
pentamidine is a drug that helps prevent pneumonia 
pollock has recovered enough that by last week he was back to 
sixhour work days 
pollock who worked as a pediatrician in private practice for 20 
years before joining the health department said he didnt know he 
had the disease when he first became the countys aids surveillance 
officer in 1985 he found out shortly afterward when he and a 
coworker decided to test themselves 
pollock hopes going public will help promote understanding about 
aids 
i think the important thing to get across is that i didnt go 
out hunting for this disease he said people who have this 
disease deserve the same compassion as anyone else suffering from a 
terminal illness 
in 1987 the fort myers newspress chose pollock and dr bob 
schwartz a infectious disease specialist and president of the 
southwest florida aids task force as the regions men of the 
year for their work with aids patients 
when i tell people theres hope i think of adrian said 
schwartz i would hope there would be a flood of respect for him 
after this is made public but god knows what will happen

mazarisharif afghanistan ap soviet soldiers likely to be 
among the last to leave afghanistan say their thoughts are turning 
to loved ones and to comrades who will never share the joy of 
homecoming 
capt sergei ofitserov of moscow is dreaming of the son he never 
has seen born during his service in afghanistan 
alexander morozov a talkative 23yearold officer with bright 
blue eyes remembers a friend killed by rebel shelling in august 
vis ali chagaev 20 is thinking of his parents reaction when 
they see the changes wrought in him by a year and a half in the 
unfinished war 
all of the troops interviewed saturday in this outpost guarding 
the withdrawal worry over the fate of afghanistan after the last 
soviet soldier leaves and whether the nineyear struggle has been 
worth the lives of 15000 comrades they would not say when they are 
leaving but their positions guarding the rear make it likely they 
will be among the last to leave 
just 35 miles south of the soviet border a few hundred soldiers 
aimed heavy machine guns and armor across the flat landscape to 
protect the soviet supply route and final withdrawal 
the area is quiet and under government control but it isnt safe 
at any time any place there could be an attack said 
ofitserov a 27yearold muscovite from a military family whose name 
means officer 
backers of the prosoviet afghan government cannot agree on 
whether it will be able to hold back us and pakistanibacked 
moslem guerrillas he said 
the afghans will have to work it out for themselves now he 
said we will only get in the way 
all soviet soldiers are to be withdrawn by feb 15 under an 
agreement signed in geneva by afghanistan the soviet union the 
united states and pakistan in april 1988 
at an outpost down the road from ofitserovs unit capt arkady 
anonich 30 said the afghan army was weak in technical expertise 
and suffered from low morale 
even in northern afghanistan near the soviet border and one of 
the areas under firmest government control the local people 
probably dont support the prosoviet government in kabul anonich 
said 
the soviet soldiers stayed away from marzarisharif a city of 
170000 people whose cold and muddy streets surround a magnificent 
12th century mosque with blue mosaic walls 
a few of the stores in mazarisharif have russian names like 
spring dream or the birch tree printed under their 
arabic names 
but many of the rest retain english and arabic signs and the 
areas strong traditions are evident 
few women are seen on the streets and fewer still without the 
traditional moslem veil 
at a field near the airport on fridays dozens of horsemen play 
the traditional game of buskashi vying to snatch up a headless goat 
and score by dropping it in a circle drawn on the ground 
anonich said the soviet soldiers are not guarding mazarisharif 
but its nearby roads and the territory surrounding the airport and 
its 30 afghan air force mig fighters and sukhoi ground support jets 
despite many complaints by afghan veterans that their service is 
ignored and that they dont fit in after they have returned home 
the soldiers on duty made clear that getting home was the main thing 
on their minds 
asked what he wants to do chagaev said his only goal was to get 
home 
he has been able to send tapes to his parents who will meet him 
in the soviet border town of termez a week or so after he returns 
he said 
chagaev said he cannot judge how he has changed but that after 
military service a mans priorities are different a youth has time 
to be obsessed with music but after army service you start to 
think about getting married about a home he said 
in the soviet union where military service is mandatory it is 
thought that if a man hasnt served in the army hes not a man 
ofitserov said 
a career soldier ofitserov would be marking his second 
anniversary in afghanistan two days after the last soviet soldier is 
to leave 
he said he will be told his new assignment upon returning to the 
soviet union but hopes first to see his 1yearold son valerian 
who was born after he left 
morozov a native of zagorsk a town northeast of moscow famous 
for its monastery is the commander of an armored attack vehicle dug 
into the brown dirt in front of a mud fort built by anonichs 
soldiers in september 
four days after he arrived at kabul airport to begin his 
afghanistan tour he and a 42yearold officer were trapped by 
rebels shelling the airport one shell landed about 20 yards from 
morozov and killed his fellow officer 
we ate together we lived together he said of his friend 
whom he refused to identify out of respect for his memory it was 
completely by chance that i wasnt hit

soviet police are being killed by criminals who 
want their handguns which are hard to find in the soviet union 
tass said tuesday 
such guns are routinely issued only to police and security 
officers in the soviet union soldiers typically are issued weapons 
only for use in the field and hunters must pass rigorous inspection 
before obtaining a rifle 
the news agency tass said murders of police officers for their 
guns had doubled in 1988 although it did not give any numbers as 
an example it said two young policemen in the city of gorky were 
shot in the back by criminals wielding sawedoff shotguns who wanted 
their makarov pistols 
the attack was part of rising wave of violence in the soviet 
union which until recently claimed to be immune to such events 
crime in general rose 4 percent in 1988 and serious crime climbed 6 
percent tass said 
a meeting of top lawenforcement officials in moscow blamed 
organized crime complacent police drug addiction and alcoholism 
for the problems

contra leaders tuesday asked a federal judge to 
throw out a 50 million wrongful death lawsuit filed by the family 
of an american engineer slain by the rebels in nicaragua 
at a hearing on a defense motion to dismiss the case attorneys 
for the contras told us district judge stanley marcus he had no 
jurisdiction in the case 
it is not the courts role to determine what is legitimate or 
illegitimate warfare said defense attorney john e kirkpatrick 
benjamin linder 27 of portland ore was shot to death in 
nicaragua in april 1987 when usbacked rebels attacked the rural 
hydroelectric project he had volunteered to work on 
a year later his family sued top miamibased contra leaders 
including three members of the current directorate saying they 
authorized a patrol to attack the project as well as torture and 
kill linder 
kirkpatrick said linder knowingly went into a war zone and 
contended the linders lawsuit was motivated by their opposition to 
us policy in nicaragua 
outside the courtroom david linder who contends his wounded son 
was tortured with a needle to the face before finally being shot to 
death said politics did not enter the case 
we dont consider the torture of our son or the torture of 
anyone a political issue linder said 
the linders attorneys disputed a defense contention that the 
plaintiffs failed to show the engineer was specifically targeted by 
the attack on the project 
the targets were chosen in miami it was here the decision was 
made to attack and kill linder said michael ratner of the new 
yorkbased center for constitutional rights 
the judge said he would issue an opinion as soon as possible on 
the dismissal motion but did not give a date 
the linders lawsuit filed in april 1988 contends their son was 
shot at close range by a contra patrol raiding the hydroelectric 
project 
the action named several contra leaders including nicaraguan 
resistance directors adolfo calero and aristides sanchez and 
military leader enrique bermudez 
the contras have publicly contended linder was carrying a weapon 
at the time of his death and was shot accidentally in a firefight 
between sandinista militia and the rebels 
however the new york times has reported that the contras killed 
linder because they mistakenly thought he was a cuban adviser to 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government

the document strongly denounces all forms of racism including 
apartheid in south africa antisemitism religious discrimination 
and discrimination toward native peoples said the vatican official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the vaticans justice and peace commission prepared the document

solidarity leader lech walesa told 
supporters tuesday he wont press for completely free elections 
during talks with authorities because he first wants them to restore 
his unions legal status 
a spokesman for solidarity said the union wants open 
parliamentary elections eventually but is willing to delay 
fulfillment of that goal until it obtains its prime objective of 
legalizing solidarity the communist party currently controls 
nominations and ensures itself a majority of seats 
in another development government spokesman jerzy urban sought 
to play down overly optimistic expectations for the talks that began 
monday known as the round table 
one should not exaggerate the hopes evoked by the round 
table he said it is an event of significance but one 
should not imagine that the round table shall solve the problems 
standing before poland that it is some magic wand 
at the formal talks with 57 participants including a 25member 
opposition group led by walesa authorities offered solidarity 
legalization if the union endorses a package of economic and 
political reforms 
the authorities also said solidarity must agree to take part in 
nonconfrontational elections this spring that would give the 
opposition some seats in parliament but still guarantee communist 
control 
three working groups dealing with specific elements of the 
proposed compromise the economy political system and trade unions 
begin meeting wednesday the negotiations are expected to last 
four to six weeks 
the proposal on entering the political system is most sensitive 
for solidarity which does not want to be in a position of endorsing 
an electoral system in which the results are determined beforehand 
by the communist party 
however both walesa and solidarity national spokesman janusz 
onyszkiewicz indicated the union is ready to defer demands for free 
elections in order to win legalization now 
i publicly answer with full responsibility that in these 
conditions i will not seek a confrontation on the subject of 
elections walesa told a group of 500 workers and supporters at 
the technical building institute in warsaw 
the pluralism which we will obtain now may create such a 
possibility one day he said but now we are not ready for 
that 
walesas was welcomed warmly by the institutes director and 
cheered by more than 500 supporters and workers he spent a hour 
answering questions and defending his decision to engage in talks 
with authorities 
the road to the table was difficult many people think it 
doesnt make sense many say bluntly lech you believed in 1980 
you were naive and now you are still naive my answer is i 
didnt believe in 1980 and i dont believe now he said 
but there is one poland i am doing everything to take 
advantage of all chances to build agreement to build a better 
poland he said 
if the talks yield pluralism of associations the right for 
various groups to form associations and clubs it will give the 
opposition a chance to prepare people the wise and reasonable 
ones prepare them for better elections in the future walesa said 
onyszkiewicz who held his own news conference at warsaw 
university for about 200 polish and foreign journalists said 
solidarity would not be nominating a list of candidates to future 
elections but he said some solidarity members could run as 
individuals not as representatives of the union 
asked about the suggestion made monday by interior minister gen 
czeslaw kiszczak that the elections be nonconfrontational 
onyszkiewicz said the union understood kiszczak to mean 
nondivisive not an opportunity for sharpening of conflicts for 
an open war 
onyszkiewicz said solidaritys priorities are obvious we have 
been for free elections for a long time since 1981 but we allow a 
certain temporary time not too long when those free elections can 
be partial to some extent 
government sources have said the authorities are willing to offer 
the opposition 20 percent to 40 percent of the seats in parliament 
after elections to be held in april or may 
polish elections are structured so that people of different 
parties never oppose each other the party controls who is 
nominated ensuring that the polish united workers communist party 
always wins a majority of seats

mardi gras bawdiness blossomed on bourbon 
street as men in miniskirts pranced past gay bars tuesday in 
defiance of nearfreezing temperatures that kept most of the 
estimated 17 million revelers bundled up 
the french quarter filled quickly despite the cold and some 
hardy parade lovers staked out spots by pitching tents along 
historic st charles avenue well before dawn 
for the most part costumes gave way to parkas and winter gear 
covering up much of the usual nudity however observers said the 
weather had little effect on the size of the crowd 
the less you wear the more you get your picture taken 
bragged a man in black lace corset garters and goose bumps who 
would not give his name i live to just go up and down the street 
and get my picture taken its one time of year and ill freeze for

i guess to outoftowners it would be kind of strange said 
jan rutherford of bay st louis miss well she said with

robbers have raided 52 freight trains hauling 
earthquake relief supplies to armenia tass said tuesday 
residents of stepanavan hoping to rebuild on their own are unable 
to obtain building materials or discover who is allocating land and 
no one in armenia is prepared for the imminent shortage of 
electricity expected when a nuclear power plant is shut down for 
fear of further quakes the official news agency said 
the reports were just the latest problems hobbling relief efforts 
since the dec 7 earthquake that devastated northwestern armenia and 
killed more than 25000 people 
thieves struck at least 52 freight trains bringing in goods to 
armenia according to usik arutyunyan armenian minister of internal 
affairs measures have been taken to increase security on the trains 
citizens throughout armenia azerbaijan and georgia will suffer a 
shortage of electricity when the first unit of the yerevan nuclear 
power plant is shut down in two weeks tass said quoting the 
politburo commission on earthquake relief the commission considered 
expanding the use of natural gas and complained that work is 
proceeding too slowly on expanding the capacity of a thermal power 
plant in razdan 
the commission also criticized the armenian state construction 
committee for inadequate management of the reconstruction of 
quakeravaged towns and for the stepanavan residents problems in 
undertaking their own rebuilding projects 
the stepanavan city council also was cited for poor organization 
of relief lack of initiative and openness

a judge on tuesday dropped six of 35 
charges against the man on trial in the blackstone valley sniper 
case rejecting prosecution arguments that all the charges were 
brought in good faith 
closing arguments were scheduled wednesday in the trial of peter 
t trepanier who is charged in a series of sniping attacks in 
december 1986 and january 1987 and a series of burglaries and house 
fires from april to june 1987 no one was killed defense attorneys 
said they would call no witnesses 
the charges dismissed by superior court judge dominic f cresto 
involved the dec 11 1987 shooting of michael l clerc a 
woonsocket truck driver whose truck was attacked in north 
smithfield and a june 1 1987 breakin at the glocester home of 
muriel winsor 
it isnt like we didnt have the evidence to bring the 
charges prosecutor eva marie mancuso said weve sill got six 
assaults with intent to commit murder and three firstdegree arsons 
that carry a life sentence 
cresto said the clerc shooting was not similar to the other six 
sniping attacks with which trepanier is charged and said no evidence 
of a bullet or shell casings was discovered 
the judge said there was no evidence that trepanier was involved 
in the winsor breakin but said a jury should decide whether 
trepanier is guilty of setting a fire at the winsor house and two in 
burrillville because of similarities among the blazes 
the trial started jan 27 it had been expected to last six 
weeks but mancuso who presented more than 40 witnesses said it 
moved more quickly than expected because of a lack of 
crossexamination by defense attorneys 
trepanier 25 originally was charged with seven counts of 
assault with intent to commit murder and seven counts of conspiracy 
to commit murder in connection with the sniping attacks n cumberland 
and north smithfield and burglaries and house fires in burrillville 
and glocester 
cresto said there was not enough evidence for counts of 
conspiracy to commit murder assault with intent to commit murder 
conspiracy to enter a house entering a house with intent to commit 
larceny malicious mischief and firing a weapon in a compact area 
russell ducharme 24 a high school classmate faces virtually 
the same charges and will be tried later

some notsowild turkeys have been making 
nuisances of themselves in suburban communities near plymouth rock 
perching on cars and taking over birdfeeders state wildlife 
officials said tuesday 
some of the big birds have been spotted wandering down streets 
and even have chased people in parts of plymouth and bristol 
counties according to james cardoza head of the states wild 
turkey restoration project 
richard turner who works for the state division of fisheries and 
wildlife at its bourne office said he received a complaint from the 
owner of a mercedes benz who was not happy to find a turkey 
trotting over the hood and roof of his expensive car last year he 
came across a turkey hen nesting in a mobile home park undisturbed 
by the urban setting 
turner said in a telephone interview tuesday that the birds are 
apparently penraised wild turkeys that have been freed and dont 
have the wily instincts of their truly wild counterparts he said he 
did not know how many might be loose in the two counties 
although it is illegal to keep wild turkeys in massachusetts 
turner said chicks are sometimes sold at county fairs and 
unsuspecting people have bought them thinking it would be nice to 
have some wild turkeys in their yard 
the problem according to the biologists is that the penreared 
turkeys could interbreed with and dilute the stocks of wild turkeys 
the state is trying to reintroduce to the area south of boston 
they also could introduce disease 
james baird natural history director for the massachusetts 
audubon society said he was not familiar with the turkey problem 
but he noted that it is not uncommon to see ringnecked 
pheasants lose of the reticence of wild birds when they have been 
penraised and then released into the wild 
often they wind up standing by the side of the road wondering 
what to do next baird said birds do become habituated to a 
human presence as long as it is nonthreatening and they are liable 
to turn up anywhere they can find food 
the states wild turkey restoration effort began in 1972 with the 
release of a few pairs of wild birds captured in new york state 
since then the number of wild turkeys in the berkshires the states 
western mountains has grown to about 5000 
since 1979 the state has helping them spread east through the 
state by trapping and relocating birds from the berkshires 
for the past nine years the birds have been numerous enough in 
some areas to allow hunting last year hunters bagged a record 471 
birds most in western massachusetts

nearly 200 black detainees 
some held without charge for nearly 1000 days are staging a hunger 
strike to demand their freedom parents of the prisoners said 
tuesday 
in another protest more than 150 white women demanded the 
government halt conscription 
the hunger strike began jan 23 with 20 detainees at diepkloof 
prison in soweto the huge black township outside johannesburg by 
monday all 191 detainees there had stopped eating parents of some 
detainees told reporters 
we have tried all avenues we have gone to the courts we have 
petitioned government ministers but to no avail explained 
wallace montsitsi 64 who said his son has been in detention since 
december 1987 
several dozen parents of the hunger strikers called a 
johannesburg news conference to publicize the plight of their 
children

lengths of time under a 32month state of emergency about 1000 
people remain in detention 
the parents distributed a statement they said was written by the 
hunger strikers it said 20 new detainees were brought into the 
prison last week including a 15yearold and a 16yearold 
to us this hunger strike is a life and death issue and we are 
prepared to take it to its logical conclusion the statement said 
their lawyers said the strikers have been drinking only water 
supplemented by sugar and salt 
why are they held the star of johannesburg the countrys 
largest daily asked tuesday the detainees protest should cause 
all south africans to think anew about the deprivation of basic 
human rights which continues on so gross a scale 
the prison service confirmed the hunger strike but the law and 
order ministry declined to comment 
in johannesburg cape town and durban meanwhile white women 
held news conferences to demand that white men be given the choice 
to perform community service rather than military duty 
white men must serve two years of initial training then can be 
called up for up to three months a year in recent years some 
conscripts have been sent to quell unrest in black townships 
township duty is not defending my country from some foreign 
force complained scotty morton of cape town who said her son was 
hospitalized for depression during his military service 
our sons are being used against my fellow countrymen who 
are angrily protesting against unjust and discriminatory laws she 
said 
judy bester whose son is serving a sixyear prison term for 
refusing to serve noted in johannesburg that president pw botha 
never served in the military botha was single and in his early 20s 
during world war ii when thousands of south africans fought for the

were injured monday when police using whips and batons broke up a 
prayer service for a slain activist police said the service was 
considered illegal 
it was in memory of sicelo dhlomo who was killed last year 
shortly after appearing on a cbs news documentary children of 
apartheid

the pentagon has been left largely rudderless 
by the travails of defense secretarydesignate john tower at a time 
when the new bush administration is studying big cuts in military 
spending insiders say 
despite uncertainties caused by the delay in approving tower 
however the white house says that the former senator has been 
actively involved in advising the president on budgetary and other 
military concerns 
on tuesday senators and the white house said that the latest fbi 
report on tower showed that there was nothing to new allegations of 
drinking and womanizing to disqualify him from the job the senate 
armed services committee which last thursday postponed a vote on 
its recommendation of towers nomination is now expected to vote 
this week and send the matter to the chambers floor 
but as the process has drawn on pentagon officials who are 
holdovers from the reagan administration complain that morale within 
the nations military headquarters is falling and has created 
uncertainty within the department 
the officials interviewed over the last week insisted on 
anonymity because many want to remain in their current jobs or move 
to another government post 
although some officials say they are concerned the delay has left 
the pentagon rudderless others insist that tower has maintained his 
influence with the one man who really counts george bush and 
that the budget bush will submit to congress on thursday will 
reflect towers input 
the white house says tower has been a regular participant in the 
budget meetings for several weeks and bush is relying on his 
longtime friend for military advice 
bush has shown no inclination to back away from tower but instead 
has defended him at every turn at his news conference monday bush 
said tower should not have to withdraw his name based on 
unsubstantiated rumors about his personal life the president said 
he fully endorsed his nominee 
tower a former chairman of the senate armed services committee 
has come under fire not only for allegations about his personal 
life but also because of lucrative consulting work he has done for 
defense contractors since he left the senate 
since bushs inauguration jan 20 the pentagon has been directed 
on an acting basis by william h taft iv who was the deputy defense 
secretary under reagan tower has his own team which he plans to 
move in after his confirmation 
in the interim pentagon officials say there is uncertainty 
within the department over the budget the possibility that the 
pentagon might lose influence within the administration because of 
towers problems and worries over the pentagons image already 
tarnished by a huge defense contracting fraud scandal 
by all accounts tower has been actively engaged in internal 
budget debates with bush aides for several days and according to 
one official has successfully blocked a proposal to hold defense 
spending to zero growth for the next four years 
the budget for next year however will be cut back to zero 
growth requiring 64 billion in cuts in budget authority even 
though no one at the white house knows the effect of that move on 
specific weapon programs the sources say 
every new administration has a problem with the first budget 
and the lack of time but without a defense secretary or a 
defense team the white house budget people talk in abstract numbers 
and have no idea what happens to specific programs when they cut 
money like this said one official

a un panel on tuesday launched an 18month study 
on the risk of climate changes including global warming and rising 
sea levels that have been linked to atmospheric pollution 
the chairman swedish meteorology professor bert bolin called on 
governments for early action to prevent a crisis 
the study will gather data on climate change and its possible 
effects and will suggest remedies bolin said after a twoday 
meeting of the group 
cutting down on the use of fossil fuels is likely to be a main 
recommendation in the study to be presented to the un general 
assembly in 1990 he said 
carbon dioxide builds up by burning of fossil fuels like oil 
coal and gas but also through widespread cutting down of trees 
chlorofluorocarbons known mainly as spray propellants also remain 
a factor despite global measures to cut their use bolin said 
the gases are believed to create atmospheric changes that slow 
the escape of heat from earth in a phenomenon known as the 
greenhouse effect 
scientists fear global warming could ultimately lead to more 
frequent extreme weather like frosts and heat waves and changes in 
the sea level and weather patterns 
the group featuring experts from 30 nations was set up in 
november by the world meteorological organization and the un 
environment program

the government rejected harsh criticism of 
john negroponte and said tuesday his apparent selection as the new 
us ambassador may indicate washington is ready for better 
relations with mexico 
contrary to what many think the designation of negroponte is 
not necessarily bad the government newspaper el nacional said 
tuesday in a frontpage editorial 
late monday night the foreign ministry said it had sent a letter 
to washington accepting the appointment of negroponte whose choice 
has not been announced officially by the white house 
by sending this letter the government of mexico expresses to 
the united states of america its wish that the selection of this 
career diplomat contribute to the strengthening of bilateral ties 
with equality and strict respect for the sovereignty of both 
countries a ministry statement said 
negroponte a deputy national security adviser who was ambassador 
to honduras in 198285 would be the first career diplomat to serve 
as us ambassador to mexico in a decade he would replace charles 
j pilliod the third political appointee in a row to hold the job 
mexico has opposed us interference in central america and the 
controversy centers on negropontes role in us aid for nicaraguan 
rebels fighting the leftist sandinista government 
while negroponte was ambassador in honduras it became a base for 
the rebels called contras and the us military presence grew 
dramatically 
mexican critics of negroponte many of them on the political 
left have described him as an international meddler 
he has been the target of scathing news stories bitter 
editorials cartoons and sarcastic puns on his name which can be 
translated as black bridge 
some compare him to machiavelli and one cartoon depicted him in 
formal diplomatic attire fashioned from military camouflage material 
after reports of the appointment last week president carlos 
salinas de gortaris government said nothing while the media 
controversy raged 
in breaking the official silence the ministry said negropontes 
appointment was in line with what president bush and secretary of 
state james a baker iii have said about improving bilateral 
relations 
el nacional said it its editorial negroponte was a faithful 
executor of the instructions of a government blinded by apocalyptic 
ideological visions he may now be one of an administration that 
cleans up the broken dishes left by its predecessors 
a clearer us vision of a stronger stable and more prosperous 
southern neighbor could mean closer cooperation on pressing problems 
like mexicos huge foreign debt the paper said 
many of negropontes critics are troubled by his close contacts 
with gen gustavo alvarez martinez a former chief of the honduran 
armed forces 
alvarez martinez is known as the godfather of the contra movement 
and was widely accused of serious human rights violations in the 
military effort to quell the honduran left 
he commanded the armed forces from 1982 until other senior 
officers removed him in 1984 alvarez martinez was shot to death 
last month in tegucigalpa capital of honduras and a leftist group 
claimed responsibility

president bush plans to send congress a 116 
trillion budget for fiscal 1990 on thursday that would freeze 
military spending at the level of inflation to help pay for new 
domestic initiatives administration aides said tuesday 
bush himself said his budget would make a strong beginning 
toward the major campaign promises he made during a 1988 campaign in 
which he repeatedly evoked a kinder and gentler nation 
in a major change of emphasis bush will reject former president 
reagans call for a 2 percent rise in defense spending above 
inflation and propose increases in dozens of categories that reagan 
sought to slash said officials who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
bushs budget outline a 125page rewrite of the lameduck budget 
reagan submitted last month was pronounced pretty well 
finalized by bush on tuesday 
he spoke briefly with reporters during a final budget session 
with budget director richard g darman vice president dan quayle 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and white house economist michael 
boskin 
then bush went to capitol hill where he told both republican 
and democratic groups he would reach out to congress to try to forge 
a consensus budget 
i am under no illusions that we are going to keep everybody 
happy bush told a luncheon of senate republicans 
of his new budget plan bush said it will meet my fundamental 
commitments made to the american people in terms of not going out 
there and raising taxes it will make i think a strong beginning 
in some of the areas that a lot of us talked about in the past 
campaign the environment education certainly antinarcotics 
its not going to be without controversy he added 
bush also visited with the senate democrats delivering 
essentially the same message and then met in closed sessions with 
house republican leaders and house speaker jim wright 
house minority leader bob michel told reporters afterward that 
bush also mentioned child care in his list of initiatives that would 
be reflected in thursdays budget plan 
bush decided on the defense freeze in budget sessions over the 
weekend including one attending by defense secretarydesignate john 
tower sources said 
defense spending would be held to the rate of inflation for 
fiscal 1990 then allowed to rise slightly over inflation in later 
years the sources said 
reagan in a budget largely ignored by congress had proposed 
increasing defense spending authority to 3152 billion for the 
fiscal year that begins next oct 1 from 2988 billion in the 
current year 
in holding defense spending to the level of inflation bush would 
free up a potential of about 6 billion in spending authority 
however in terms of cash outlays that could actually be 
spent in fiscal 1990 the amount gained by bush from the maneuver 
would be closer to 2 billion 
bush will squeeze another several billion dollars from other 
areas of the budget by making use of what one budget official 
described tuesday as wiggle room in the reagan plan 
the reagan plan which will still serve as the core of the bush 
plan proposed steps that would get the federal deficit down to 
925 billion in fiscal 1990 
but the grammrudman budgetbalancing law which calls for 
eliminating the deficits by the year 1993 in annual steps only 
requires that the deficit be 100 billion or less in fiscal 1990 
bush has promised to reach the 100 billion target without 
proposing new taxes although he was expected to retain a variety of 
user fees and other forms of new revenue included in the reagan 
budget 
bushs combined campaign pledges would cost close to 6 billion 
including proposals for a 1000 child care tax credit for low 
income families for a 500 million national school merit program 
for beefedup federal programs for the homeless and for an 
aggressive program to combat acid rain 
holding defense spending at the level of inflation which was 
44 percent last year although a slightly lower figure is used for 
defense calculations is consistent with bushs call for a 
flexible freeze 
the budget will reflect virtually all of bushs major campaign 
promises in one form or another although in some cases such as 
the merit school program the items will be scaled back officials 
said 
marlin fitzwater bushs press secretary said there may be a 
few loose ends but not very many essentially its done

texans arent just watching the television 
miniseries lonesome dove theyre participants as actors 
history buffs and members of the real lonesome dove church 
the first part of larry mcmurtrys pulitzerwinning novel was set 
in texas and much of the movie was filmed here 
the austin americanstatesman has printed daily frontpage boxes 
advising readers on how to spot local scenes and actors appearing in 
each nights episode of the fourpart miniseries that started sunday 
tuesdays article noted that as the storys cattle drive moves 
north out of texas the less well see of austin however some 
of wednesday nights scenes were filmed east of austin on some 
property near lake walter long that executive producerscreenwriter 
bill wittliff used to own the newspaper said 
central texas papers have been interviewing lonesome dove stars 
and writing about the series for weeks 
gov bill clements a history buff who owns hundreds of volumes 
about the state said mcmurtrys novel was the best texasrelated 
fiction hed ever read 
as an amateur student of texas history certainly in my 
opinion thats the best novel thats ever been written about early 
texas without any question and the two episodes that i have now 
watched i like very very much clements said tuesday 
the cbstv western tells the story of two retired texas rangers 
who drive a cattle herd from the fictional town of lonesome dove on 
the rio grande along the usmexican border to montana 
texas house speaker gib lewis a fort worth resident said that 
when the actors were to be shown in a fictional fort worth ill 
be riding in there with them 
despite all the praise there were a few discouraging words 
mcmurtry a native texan says he got the idea for the title of 
his novel after seeing the lonesome dove baptist churchs van pull 
into a restaurant at ponder in denton county 
some members of the church dont like some of the language and 
morals in the miniseries 
i didnt care for all the sex said onalee cate 75 one of 
about 400 members of the lonesome dove baptist church in southlake 
near fort worth 
but she continued there are vulgar parts but i thought the 
action was real good 
i liked it as a whole especially the backtoearth living im 
old fashioned you see she added 
personally i cant be too proud of it said joseph bud 
tanner 73 a descendant of the settlers who lived in what was known 
as the dove community founded by a group of missouri farmers 
dove was founded 142 years ago and was an area where farmers grew 
cotton and cantaloupe beans and okra 
the rev keith wells pastor of the lonesome dove church said he 
hadnt read all of the novel nor seen the first installment of the 
miniseries 
theres some fairly lewd comments within the script said 
wells its just hollywood trying to put something out to sell 
despite his enthusiasm for lonesome dove the governor said 
he did have one reservation the cattle drives ultimate 
destination of montana 
that was perhaps the one thing in the novel that i never did 
really quite understand clements said 
my history has told me that an awful lot of texans at that time 
were taking cattle into kansas and colorado and nebraksa and even 
to wyoming but really why this author picked out montana im not 
sure i think that historically it was in these other areas that 
most of those cattle drives took place and most of the texans went 
and settled

the house and senate voted overwhelmingly today 
to scuttle a 45500 congressional pay raise and sent the measure to 
president bush for his signature in time to prevent the increase 
from taking effect at midnight 
the house voted 38048 to block the 51 percent salary boost and 
the senate concurred less than three hours later by a 946 margin 
the senate had passed a similar but not identically worded measure 
955 last week 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush would sign the 
bill which also would kill large pay raises for federal judges and 
senior officials in the executive branch the president will abide 
by the wishes of the congress he said 
lawmakers in both houses said the votes were a bow to 
overwhelming public sentiment against the big boost in the current 
congressional pay of 89500 a year 
you can fight city hall and you can take on the congress of the 
united states with all its legerdemain and all its legislative 
ability said sen jesse helms rnc 
the six senators voting to permit the raise were democrats 
christopher dodd of connecticut edward kennedy of massachusetts and 
spark matsunaga of hawaii and republicans james jeffords of vermont 
and frank murkowski and ted stevens both of alaska 
it took a twothirds vote for the repeal measure to clear the 
house and there was no doubt about the outcome 
we face reality here today said rep vic fazio dcalif a 
staunch supporter of the increase were doing what has become 
inevitable 
today we the congress will be reflecting the voice of the 
people regarding the attitude on congressional pay said rep 
jerry lewis rcalif 
one lawmaker spoke out forcefully in favor of the pay raise and 
drew an ovation from the lawmakers gathered to vote against him 
each member of the house democrat and republican is worth 
135000 said rep dan rostenkowski dill he said that whatever 
the pay and perquisites received by lawmakers it doesnt make up 
for the missed birthdays school plays and other family occasions 
that are part of life in congress 
public opinion polls reflected overwhelming opposition to the 
increase and the house debated the issue before a packed gallery 
with a long line of spectators waiting in the capitol corridors 
hoping for a seat 
the repeal of the raise recommended by a federal commission and 
endorsed by presidents reagan and bush would leave congressional 
pay at 89500 a year 
at the same time it would leave intact a muchcriticized system 
that permits lawmakers to earn thousands of dollars in speaking 
fees permits them to earn other outside income and enables them to 
have lobbyists pay travel costs for public appearances 
even as the house moved toward a vote lawmakers cautioned that 
without a raise for judges for senior executive branch officials 
the government would be hardpressed to find and keep qualified men 
and women on the job there are supreme court justices who make 
less than their clerks the day after they the clearks retire and 
go into private practice said fazio 
this issue isnt over said rep tom tauke riowa a leading 
opponent of the pay raise who said the congress must deal this year 
with pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questions 
involved in honoraria and other forms of outside income for 
lawmakers 
raise opponents cleared the path for rejection votes in both 
houses today after they engineered the collapse monday of house 
speaker jim wrights suggested alternative a 30 percent pay 
increase 
the speaker conceded after his forces were beaten decisively when 
they tried to adjourn the house let the full raise become law at 
1201 am wednesday and then schedule a thursday vote to scale back 
the increase to 30 percent the opening move in that strategy failed 
on a 23888 vote 
public clamor against the raise has been growing each day a 
weekend gallup poll asked 1001 adults from friday through sunday 
whether they favored or opposed increasing congressional pay from 
89500 to 135000 the amount of the proposed increase 
the results with a fourpoint margin of error showed 82 percent 
opposed with only 15 percent in favor 
one immediate casualty of the raise appears to be a plan to ban 
lawmakers receipt of fees for speeches and appearances these often 
are paid by special interests seeking to influence legislation 
many members of congress who accept the money said they do so to 
supplement an inadequate income 
assuming the full raise is defeated any elimination of the 
26850 that house members can retain in honoraria or the 35800 
that senators can keep would be a move to reduce lawmakers pay 
senators already have unanimously approved an honoraria ban for 
themselves but made it conditional upon the full raise becoming law 
also left dangling was a proposal to end a loophole in federal 
law that allowed 190 house members to accumulate 39 million in 
leftover campaign cash which could be converted to their personal 
use a bipartisan house negotiating team agreed to eliminate the 
loophole if the raise went into effect

attorney general dick thornburghs extensive 
holdings in bluechip stocks have forced his recusal from a variety 
of legal and policy issues since he took office last august 
the attorney generals stock portfolio which reads like a roster 
of major us corporations includes atampt westinghouse hj heinz 
ibm atlantic richfield amoco corp general motors mobil corp 
proctor and gamble and sears roebuck 
before his senate confirmation last summer thornburgh reported 
that the value of his stock holdings was between 500000 and 
700000 said david runkel a spokesman for the attorney general 
thornburghs holdings in large corporations could force him to 
recuse himself from a number of issues that may arise during his 
tenure as attorney general runkel conceded 
the companies in which thornburgh invested have diverse 
operations that could potentially become the subject of justice 
department action on any of several fronts including environmental 
enforcement antitrust investigations or litigation involving 
government contracts 
historically the justice department policy and legal activities 
involve large corporations notably its extensive civil antitrust 
investigation of oil companies that ended in 1983 
before he took office thornburgh asked the agencys various 
divisions to determine what cases might pose a conflictofinterest 
for the attorney general according to justice department records 
thornburgh agreed to recuse himself from participation in any 
matter in which he has a financial interest to resign as a 
corporate director of rite aid corp merrill lynch amp co and arco 
chemical co the office of government ethics said in a letter to 
the senate judiciary committee 
under the recusal policy he later adopted thornburgh 
disqualified himself from several legal cases pending before the 
department according to records compiled by the attorney generals 
office 
the law allows thornburgh to obtain a waiver of disqualification 
but runkel said he doubted the attorney general would seek such 
waivers so far the attorney general has not sought any waivers 
runkel said tuesday 
thornburgh also notified division heads that he would not 
participate in decisions involving several other issues that could 
involve the agency in litigation or policymaking 
the most notable case is thornburghs blanket recusal from 
decisions involving the enforcement of the atampt divestiture consent 
decree 
thornburgh also has recused himself from two issues as a result 
of his holding of at least 15000 worth of westinghouse electric 
corp stock 
he declined involvement in the antitrust divisions review last 
summer of schindler holding cos proposed acquisition of 
westinghouses elevator subsidiary 
he also recused himself from participation from any litigation 
that might arise from the cleanup of a government nuclear weapons 
plant in fernald ohio operated by westinghouse 
thornburghs ownership of at least 5000 worth of atampt common 
stock in an individual retirement account makes him the third 
consecutive attorney general ineligible to oversee the antitrust 
divisions role in court cases following divestiture 
in 1980 before he became president reagans first attorney 
general william french smith and his wife placed their stock and 
bond holdings valued at least 23 million into a blind trust 
smith recused himself from atampt divestiture matters because he 
had been a director of pacific bell 
his successor edwin meese iii was criticized last month by an 
internal justice department report for participating in matters 
involving the regional bell companies while still holding stock in 
those companies 
thornburgh meanwhile also recused himself from any government 
involvement in litigation arising from a jan 2 1988 fueloil 
spill near pittsburgh because his former law firm kirkpatrick and 
lockhart represents ashland oil co 
he also recused himself from any policy discussions about whether 
the food and drug administration should play a role in implementing 
californias proposition 65 
the law adopted by voter referendum in 1986 requires extensive 
warnings about toxic chemicals in the workplace and in labeling 
prepared foods 
thornburghs biggest single holding is at least 50000 worth 
stock in hj heinz co the prepared food manufacturer based in the 
attorney generals hometown of pittsburgh 
the attorney general also has recused himself from reviewing any 
grant application by harvard university where his wife virginia 
is the univeristys inhouse advocate of the handicapped 
before he became attorney general thornburgh was the director of 
the institute of politics at harvard 
thornburgh also recused himself from any involvement in the 
governments handling of a suit against the comptroller of the 
currency challenging the right of national banks to insure municipal 
bonds 
the government has successfully defended the longstanding lawsuit 
by an insurance trade association challenging the comptrollers 
decision to allow citicorp to acquire and operate a municipal bond 
insurance business 
thornburgh owns at least 5000 in citicorp stock and at least 
5000 worth of notes issued by the bank corporation

nearly 2000 soviet soldiers were killed as the red 
army pulled out of afghanistan bringing the overall soviet death 
toll in nine years of war to 15000 a foreign ministry official 
said tuesday 
it doesnt mean that during the last months we had the 
bloodiest period of the war in afghanistan insisted yuri k 
alexeyev head of the ministrys middle east department but he 
added we had shellings by the opposition of the cities and a 
lot of civilians died and of course soviet servicemen 
the last reported soviet death toll was 13310 
at a news conference alexeyev said the new death toll came from 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze who left pakistan on 
monday the official news agency tass paraphrased shevardnadzes 
remarks at a news conference in islamabad and said he told 
reporters soviet casualties over the nine years of war reached 
15000 
alexeyev said shevardnadze had used the phrase up to 15000 
and said the figure applied to the number killed 
after they began their withdrawal may 15 soviet forces had to 
rely increasingly on afghan government troops to protect them from 
guerrilla attacks the pullout brokered by the united nations is 
to be completed by feb 15 
the soviet union began withdrawing the last of its soldiers 
saturday and shevardnadze said monday the rest would be home in a 
week 
gen alexei d lizichev told a moscow news conference may 25 that 
13310 soviet troops had been killed 35478 wounded and 311 were 
missing he said his figures applied from dec 27 1979 when soviet 
troops and tanks entered the war until may 1 1988 
alexeyev did not provide numbers of wounded and missing 
also at tuesdays news conference igor a rogachev a deputy 
soviet foreign minister reiterated the pullout of soviet troops 
from afghanistan will be completed before the deadline 
by feb 15 not a single soviet soldier will remain in

newspaper komsomolskaya pravda reported that by friday 3500 tons 
of flour were brought into kabul which is suffering food and fuel 
shortages because of a blockade by antigovernment moslem 
guerrillas the paper said 3475 tons of ammunition also were flown 
into one afghan airport 
tass reported 1500 soviet soldiers withdrew monday and tuesday 
through termez in soviet uzbekistan without giving figures tass 
said soviet troops also are returning home via the border city of 
kushka in soviet turkmenia as well as by air 
since the second phase of the pullout began aug 15 35000 
soviet troops have left afghanistan tass reported 
the fighting continues foreign ministry spokesman gennady i 
gerasimov said 30000 rebels had massed along major roads in 
afghanistan and were trying to blockade provincial centers

tass reported the afghan army killed 11 rebels and wounded five 
who had bombarded the qanahar airport with rockets and mines the

in achin and hazrat sultan and air strikes killed four guerrillas 
in the anjil district of herat province 
tuesdays soviet newspapers featured photographs of jubilant 
soviets returning home articles focused on the soldiers joy at

the palestinian uprising in the west bank and 
gaza strip led to a substantial increase in human rights 
violations by israeli authorities last year the state department 
said tuesday in its annual report on rights conditions worldwide 
the report covering conditions in 169 countries and territories 
praised the soviet union for remarkable changes in the human 
rights field including the freeing of all prisoners detained for 
political or religious offenses 
the section on israel was one of the harshest on that country 
since the state department began issuing human rights reports in the 
mid1970s it said the actions of israeli authorities resulted in 
many avoidable deaths among palestinians since they began their 
uprising 14 months ago 
the palestinian uprising caught the israeli army by surprise 
the report said the armed forces untrained and inexperienced in 
riot control responded in a manner which led to a substantial 
increase in human rights violations it said 
shortly after the report was made public israeli deputy foreign 
minister binyamin netanyahu defended the actions of israeli forces 
israeli soldiers maintain as best they can apart from a 
few exceptions the standards of proper conduct that no country in 
the world cold maintain he said in jerusalem 
in a separate statement the israeli armys chief prosecutor 
defended the legality of israeli operations saying palestinian 
prisoners were given due process of law 
since the december 1987 start of the uprising 374 palestinians 
have been killed and thousands wounded most by army gunfire 
from time to time since the violence started in the occupied 
territories the state department has expressed criticism of israeli 
efforts to bring it under control but the report appeared to go 
beyond the earlier statements 
two private human rights groups amnesty international and the 
lawyers committee for human rights also criticized the israelis 
in a report to the house appropriations subcommittee on foreign 
operations amnesty international said that while both sides have 
used violence in the palestinian uprising there have been excesses 
on the israeli side 
demonstrators have thrown rocks and molotov cocktails the 
report said however the tactics of the israeli army have 
exceeded the use of reasonable force 
it said there have been hundreds of questionable killings by 
israeli security forces and that few have been adequately 
investigated 
amnesty international and the lawyers committee questioned the 
use of high velocity bullets by the israeli forces as well as the 
use of plastic bullets which the two organizations said can be 
lethal 
the state department report cited acrosstheboard advances in 
the soviet union but said it was premature to say whether a 
fundamental shift on rights policy has occurred there 
it said all prisoners detained on religious or political grounds 
had been released and that plans for the amendment or repeal of 
statutes limiting activities in these areas have been announced 
in addition freedom the leave the soviet union temporarily has 
been significantly expanded it said the report said there were 
also human rights gains last year in poland and hungary 
while suggesting that worldwide trends have been favorable the 
report said there were severe human rights setbacks in iraq burundi 
and sudan 
in iraq chemical warfare was used against kurdish rebels 
resulting in the death or injury of thousands and forcing tens of 
thousands to flee the country 
the report indicated that perhaps the single greatest 
rightsrelated tragedy in the world occurred in southern sudan where 
it said some reports estimated that between 100000 and 250000 
civilians died of starvation 
the deaths occurred after elements of the armed forces on each 
side in sudans civil war interfered with or failed to cooperate 
with food delivery efforts 
elsewhere the report said there were significant steps toward 
democracy and human rights protection in south korea taiwan and 
pakistan it said that the october plebiscite in chile has raised 
hopes for a peaceful return to democracy there 
the section in the report on israel was praised by james zogby 
executive director of the arabamerican institute 
for the first time in 12 years of reporting the state 
department has fulfilled its mandate to tell the truth zogby 
said the burden is now on congress to enforce the law regarding 
human rights and aid at this point congressional inaction would 
make a mockery of our stated commitment to human rights

the state department criticized the palestine 
liberation organization on tuesday over a clash with israeli forces 
in southern lebanon but reserved judgment on whether it would 
disrupt the us dialogue with yasser arafats group 
we take this incident very seriously spokesman charles e 
redman said it can have a negative impact on the usplo 
dialogue and the atmosphere necessary for a positive 
palestinianisraeli dialogue 
robert pelletreau the us ambassador to tunisia was instructed 
to take the matter up immediately with plo officials it would be 
his fourth meeting with arafats representatives since the reagan 
administration broke a 13year ban last december on us talks with 
the plo 
the attempted raid saturday in which four palestinians and one 
lebanese were killed was the first against israel since arafat at 
us urging publicly renounced terrorism in all forms he also 
accepted israels right to exist and un security council 
resolutions calling for secure borders for all countries in the 
middle east 
former assistant secretary of state richard w murphy and other 
senior us officials cautioned the plo at the time that the 
dialogue would be suspended if arafat broke his pledge to eschew 
terrorism in his dispute with israel 
moshe arens the foreign minister of israel said monday the raid 
violated the pledge while deputy israeli ambassador oded eran urged 
the state department to break off the talks with the plo 
under a barrage of questions redman said arafats renunciation 
of terrorism was supposed to be applied everywhere not just in 
israel itself but he declined to say whether the raid by two 
radical wings of the plo violated the plo chairmans promise 
identification found on the bodies of the five slain guerrillas 
indicated they belonged to dr george habashs popular front for the 
liberation of palestine and the palestine liberation front headed by 
mohammed abbas 
redman said the incident and any others that might occur would be 
examined on a casebycase basis to see if they were acts of 
terrorism by the plo he did not say what pelletreau would tell the 
plo representatives in tunisia or how long it would take the state 
department to complete its investigation 
ahmed abdulrahman spokesman fo the plo said the guerrillas 
were fighting the israeli occupation of southern lebanon and 
defending palestinian camps 
what are the israelis doing in south lebanon he told the 
associated press in paris by telephone from plo headquarters in 
tunis is that aggression or not we have been facing this israeli 
aggression since 1982 we have the right to selfdefense we have 
the right to defend our people and our camps 
asked if he was specifically denying that the five were en route 
to israel abdulrahman said in fact i dont know we are in a 
defensive attitude against the israelis in south lebanon

the bush administration has begun a review of 
nineyearold allied trade sanctions imposed against the soviet 
union following its invasion of afghanistan the state department 
said tuesday 
the noexceptions policy requires allied rejection of all 
soviet requests for the purchase of items with potential military 
use 
state department spokesman charles redman said us allies in the 
15nation coordinating committee for strategic exports cocom 
believe that the policy should now be lifted 
redman said that with the soviets afghan withdrawal in its final 
stage the administration has begun a review of this policy under 
an agreement signed last spring the soviets pledged to have all of 
its troops out of afghanistan by feb 15 
redman said the administration continues to oppose the export of 
goods or technology in cocom that would pose a strategic risk 
whatever might come out of this review and whatever might be 
decided in cocom lifting the no exceptions policy would in no way 
weaken the cocom regime or facilitate the flow of sensitive 
technology to the soviet union he said 
even if the policy is lifted all exports of dualuse 
technologies would still be subject to cocom review and the united 
states would still block the sale of any militarily sensitive 
technologies to the soviet union he said 
cocom membership includes japan and all nato allies except 
iceland

since the division of the peninsula 44 years ago open political 
talks wednesday to prepare for the first meeting of their prime 
ministers 
if they take place the prime ministerial talks will be the 
highest level held between the two koreas they are aimed at easing 
tensions by resolving political and military disputes 
fivemember delegations each headed by a vice minister are to 
meet at the truce village of panmunjom to negotiate terms for the 
talks 
two days later lawmakers of the two sides are to meet for an 
eighth round of talks on a nonaggression pact 
preparations also are under way to open another channel of 
dialogue in march this time for sports officials who want to form a 
single korean team for the 1990 asian games in beijing china 
the flurry of talks comes at a time when relations between the 
countries are undergoing changes after many years of bitter 
competition 
we are getting mixed signals from north korea said kim 
namsik a south korean who specializes in north koean affairs 
although they seem flexible on some issues their basic positions 
are still very strong and show no sign of change he said 
professor lee hojae of seouls korea university said north 
korea appears to be changing but the change is very slow and would 
not bring a rapid improvement of relations with south korea 
last week the communist government signed an unprecedented 
agreement with a south korean industrialist to undertake several 
joint ventures including a major tourist complex but it was 
unclear whether the business agreement indicated a policy change 
toward seoul 
any such changes will be tested when north koreas military and 
political officials sit down with their south korean partners 
wednesday to discuss highly sensitive issues such as the us 
military presence in the south 
north korea has indicated repeatedly it will call off scheduled 
meetings unless joint ussouth korea military exercises are 
halted the exercises normally start in february and last about two 
months 
pyongyang suspended all dialogue with seoul in 1986 to protest 
the maneuvers an annual event since 1976 
the us command in seoul last week refused to confirm or deny 
whether maneuvers have begun but said officials of the two 
countries began planning on the training many months ago and 
that planning continues 
in the past the maneuvers were announced well in advance but 
this year a formal announcement is being delayed at seouls request 
south korean defense minister lee sanghoon said last week the 
scale and format of the exercises could be reduced if north korea 
shows a concrete change of attitude 
military officials of the united states and south korea say the 
exercises are needed to deter a possible invasion by north korea 
pyongyangs forces ivnaded south korea in 1950 starting a 
threeyear war 
the highlevel talks first were proposed by north korea on nov 
16 
north korea said the main agenda should include the withdrawal by 
1991 of the 42000 us troops stationed in south korea and a 
reduction of the two koreas armed forces to 100000 each by the 
same year 
south korea has an estimated 650000 men under arms and north 
korea about 850000

americans obligated themselves to 54 billion 
more in credit than they paid off in december as consumer debt grew 
at an annual rate of 99 percent the government reported tuesday 
the federal reserve board said the december increase followed a 
revised increase of 47 billion in november and a rise of 39 
billion in october 
decembers 99 percent rise in the seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of credit growth was up from an 85 percent rate in november 
and a 72 percent increase in october 
decembers increase matched the 99 percent rise recorded last 
august which was the highest since a 152 percent increase in june 
the december jump was paced by an increase in outstanding auto 
loans while growth in the category of debt that includes credit 
cards slowed from the rapid pace of the preceding two months 
consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic 
health because it accounts for twothirds of the gross national 
product 
economist sandra shaber of the futures group in washington said 
the latest report indicates that consumer finances were healthy in 
december and throughout 1988 
despite the veryoftenheard concerns about consumers 
staggering under a debt burden that really is not the case ms 
shaber said what weve had for two years now is people borrowing 
no more than their income gains were 
auto loans rose by 3 billion in december a 124 percent annual 
rate of growth that followed a 57 percent increase during november 
revolving credit the category that includes credit cards 
increased by 14 billion in december a 91 percent annual rate of 
growth after having risen 211 percent in november 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by 
13 billion in december a 95 percent increase in the annual rate 
after having inched up 04 percent in november 
loans for mobile homes decreased by 221 million or a 103 
percent drop after rising 25 percent in the previous month 
overall total consumer debt reached a seasonally adjusted 6673 
billion in december up 89 percent from a year earlier

health experts told a senate panel tuesday that 
the defeat of the pay raise will hurt their efforts to recruit 
scientists to join the governments battle against aids 
they also said more money was needed for government aids 
education programs 
scientists at the food and drug administration can leave for 
salaries of four and five times above government pay levels fda 
commissioner frank young told the labor and human resources 
committee 
the pay voted down by congress on tuesday would have raised 
congressional pay by 51 percent but it would have also permitted 
increases in the toplevel pay of executive branch officials 
including government scientists at the fda and the national 
institutes of health 
young said the fda is in the same predicament as nih which he 
said hasnt been able to recruit a senior scientist in the last 10 
years 
were in a difficult position of knowing how to prepare a 
budget young also said because we cant anticipate two years 
ahead as the budget process requires 
for example he said the fda hadnt anticipated that the number 
of applications for aids drug research would double that there 
would be annual instead of biannual inspections of the nations drug 
supply or that there would be problems with inspections of condoms 
and rubber gloves 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
disease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering it 
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections 
as of jan 2 the centers for disease control in atlanta said 
there were 32311 aids cases reported in the united states in 1988 
a 57 percent increase in the number of reported aids cases from 1987 
samuel o thier who heads the institute of medicine at the 
national academy of sciences said the approximately 1 billion 
recommended for education and other health measures by 1990 was 
too low 
a substantial sum of money will have to be spent over and 
above 1 billion a year to provide treatment facilities for 
ivintravenous drug usersto prevent drug abuse and to mitigate 
the dangers of shared needles said thier 
despite the shortfall of personnel and money the experts said 
they had made considerable progress in the last year in educating 
the public and in creating and expanding programs to provide 
services to critically ill aids victims 
young said the fda has been successful in its efforts to 
streamline the review process of drug treatments for aids and 
aidsrelated conditions 
despite a marked increase in applications from pharmaceutical 
companies to the agency for aids drug research and development the 
commissioner said the fda has cut the review time for aids drug 
therapies by about 50 percent 
he cited the examples of two recently approved drugs flutomide 
and an aerosolized pentamidine used to treat infections and cancers 
that are often fatal to aids patients 
the new drug application for flutomide was submitted to the fda 
in october 1988 and approved jan 25 while pentamidine was approved 
monday young said as of the beginning of january the fda had 
approved 213 new drug research applications 
although thier could offer no specific data on the effectiveness 
of his agencys education programs he did say national center for 
health statistics surveys show 85 percent of adults reporting they 
had seen a public service announcement on aids between may and 
august 1988 
other government officials said progress is also being made in 
expanding care for the growing population of children stricken with 
aids training police and other professionals in dealing with aids 
victims and computerizing aids information

areas wildlife authorities said 
a navy communique said the cutter yelcho arrived monday night 
the first cleanup vessel to get to the spill site 590 miles from the 
tip of south america and close to the shores of the antarctic 
peninsula 
crew members tuesday morning encircled the nearly sunken vessel 
bahia paraiso paradise bay with floating booms designed to contain 
any further oil leak according to the communique read by a 
spokesman at navy headquarters in santiago 
divers then entered the frigid waters to seal shut the bahia 
paraisos tanks it said 
the argentine research and supply ship grounded on shoals jan 28 
about two miles from palmer station us research base scientists 
say the area teams with wildlife including thousands of penguins 
the ship holds about 800 tons of fuel including diesel oil in 
bulk and aviation fuel in steel drums officials of the 
washingtonbased national science foundation say oil is leaking 
slowly from the ship which gradually sank in the shallow waters 
only a section of its superstructure remains above the surface 
they say a slick nearly 500 feet wide and two miles long is 
trailing away from the vessel toward the south threatening the 
frozen continents fragile and unspoiled environment 
a us research vessel the polar duke was expected to arrive at 
the spill later tuesday it carries a multimilliondollar cleanup 
mission organized by the national science foundation that includes 
military and civilian experts and 52 tons of sophisticated equipment 
both the yelcho and the polar duke left friday from the chilean 
port of punta arenas a major supply point for antarctic operations 
two argentine vessels are in the area of the spill and plan to 
help according to the chilean navy however they await equipment 
being flown from buenos aires argentina to a chileanrun antarctic 
base 200 miles from the accident 
an argentine embassy official in santiago told reporters monday 
the government would try to salvage the bahia paraiso once the 
environmental threat is stemmed 
a research vessel of the chilean antarctic institute also is at 
the spill site to evaluate environmental damage said the insitutes 
acting director antonio massei 
in a telephone interview in santiago he said the area around the 
accident is home to 29000 penguins scientists say many baby 
penguins soon will take their first swim in the waters and they are 
worried they could suffocate in the oil 
other wildlife also is threatened including antartic gulls and 
terns and krill a tiny shrimplike crustacean considered a vital 
link in antarcticas food chain

president bush and prime minister brian 
mulroney will set the tone for future uscanadian relations in 
talks later this week a top white house aide said tuesday 
previewing talks that bush will have with mulroney in ottawa on 
friday national security adviser brent scowcroft cautioned against 
expecting major decisions or developments 
bush chose canada for his first trip abroad scowcroft said to 
reaffirm the importance we attach to a close and productive 
relationship with our neighbor to the north 
scowcroft a retired air force general said bush and mulroney 
have agreed beforehand that this first meeting is one to set the 
tone and the agenda for subsequent meetings 
he did say however the two leaders are expected to discuss acid 
rain the uscanada free trade agreement maritime borders and 
military relationships among other subjects 
yet scowcroft insisted it is not a negotiating session as 
such to get down into the nittygritty of issues and determine 
specific milestones and so forth 
he acknowledged that mulroney has been pressing the united states 
hard on the acid rain pollution befouling the air and waters in the 
midwest and parts of canada and the great lakes region 
but scowcroft said that while bush promised to take action on the 
environmental problem the president isnt yet ready to make hard 
commitments to the prime minister 
i think he feels that the first step has to be the domestic 
part of the acid rain agenda before hes prepared to be all that 
specific with the canadians he said 
this is an initial meeting scowcroft added its a very 
kind of private relaxed meeting to set the tone of the relationship 
and to determine the kinds of things that the two will want to be 
talking about down the line

dastagir husini the malaysian 
snake king who has lived with about 100 poisonous cobras for two 
weeks said tuesday he will continue his feat for another few days 
he broke the world record of nine days on feb 2 the national 
news agency bernama reported tuesday without saying who had held the 
record the guinness book of world records does not list records in 
such events 
husini 63 was given a clean bill of health by dr a ganga 
daran who examined him after he stepped out of a glass cubicle at 
the national museum on tuesday 
a snake exhibition also is being held at the museum in 
conjunction with the event and visitors have paid more than 27500 
since he started his feat museum directorgeneral shahrum yub said 
the proceeds would be divided equally between husini and the museum 
i am fine and ready to prolong my stay with the snakes for 
another two or three days husini said at a news conference 
outside the cubicle 
but there should not be any condition no pressure from anybody 
for me to continue or to call off the act any time i may feel like 
doing it he said adding that he was not having any problems so 
far either from the snakes museum management or the visitors 
i am taking some vitamins prescribed by the doctor to keep up 
my strength and have been one happy entertainer before huge crowds 
who turn up even at the week hours especially on weekends he 
added 
the visitors came from all over the country as well as from 
singapore and thailand and india where snake acts are common 
the glass cubicle measures 1299 feet by 10 feet by 10 feet he 
steps out of it for 15 minutes every hour for his meals and vitamins 
the cobras are fed eggs at night and there is a bucket of water 
in the cubicle 
husini learned how to handle snakes from his father a snake 
charmer husini has taught his children the art and he said he 
hoped one of his sons mohamad ali 25 would shoot for his record

the american bar association without endorsing 
surrogate motherhood offered states a blueprint tuesday for 
legalizing the practice and making surrogacy contracts enforceable 
the abas house of delegates its policymaking body approved by 
voice vote a resolution offering states a proposed model act for 
legalizing surrogacy 
but the resolution also contained an alternative model that would 
bar enforcement of contracts in which a socalled surrogate mother 
is paid to bear a child and then give up any claim to her offspring 
the 330000member aba the nations largest organization of 
lawyers chose to adopt a resolution with conflicting options to 
avoid going on record in favor of surrogacy 
but opponents of the resolution insisted the measure would make 
it appear the aba supports the controversial practice 
this is a mechanism to buy and sell children said kurt 
melchior a san francisco lawyer who opposed the resolution our 
basic constitutional and humanistic principles are being deeply 
offended here 
the surrogacy proposal was adopted as the aba concluded its 
annual midwinter convention 
michael p sullivan of minneapolis a chief sponsor of the 
surrogacy resolution said the aba must recognize that such 
contracts are being made in many states and offer guidance to 
lawmakers 
in dealing with the new biology you cant put your head in the 
sand he said sullivan said his main interest was in assuring 
uniformity among those states that choose to make surrogacy legal 
proponents of the measure said surrogacy is a boon to the 15 
percent of married couples that are infertile and unable to adopt 
because of a shortage of babies put up for adoption 
in the surrogacy case that attracted the most nationwide 
attention the new jersey supreme court ruled in 1988 that surrogate 
motherhood for money violates the states adoption laws 
the state court voided a surrogacy contract but awarded custody 
of the child referred to as baby m to its biological father and 
his wife 
baby ms biological mother mary beth whiteheadgould won 
unsupervised visitation rights 
the ruling fueled rather than resolved the debate over surrogacy 
the resolution adopted by the aba proposed that those states 
legalizing surrogate contracts should limit them to agreements 
between a married couple and a surrogate mother the husband seeking 
the contract would have to donate his sperm or his wife would have 
to contribute the egg to establish a genetic tie between the baby 
and one of the parents 
the agreement would be approved by a judge before conception and 
there would have to be proof that the wife seeking to acquire the 
baby is unable to bear a child herself the resolution said 
also the surrogate mother would have 180 days after the child is 
conceived to repudiate the contract and keep the baby after 180 
days the couple that signed the contract to acquire the child would 
become its legal parents 
the aba also unanimously adopted a resolution calling for 
increased funding of the federal legal services corporation 
the resolution which criticized the former reagan administration 
for cutting back legal services to the poor urged president bush to 
name legal services corporation directors who are committed to 
helping the poor

low temperatures and lack of protective snow 
cover may have damaged winter wheat in parts of the central and 
southern plains a government report said tuesday 
the joint agricultural weather facility however said wheat in 
the northern plains and the corn belt benefited from snow during the 
week of jan 30feb 5 as a huge arctic system caused temperatures 
to plummet 
in kansas winter wheat was mostly poor to fair the report 
said extreme cold temperatures late in the week may have caused 
widespread winterkill but the extent of the damage was still 
unknown 
the cold weather greatly reduced greenbug activity in the 
oklahoma winter wheat crop but raised the possibility of winterkill 
in the western area of the state the report said 
the facility is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments no forecasts or estimates of crop yields are included 
in the reports 
on the chicago board of trade grain and soybean futures on 
tuesday closed about unchanged from the day before analysts said 
the markets had anticipated some wheat winterkill because of the 
cold 
moreover forecasts for more snow in the great plains have had a 
dampening effect on commodity markets 
there is a growing realization among traders that the odds of a 
backtoback crop adversity in the midwest are extremely small 
said richard feltes of refco inc a chicagobased commodities 
brokerage firm 
the agriculture department has been saying for months that a 
repeat of last years heavy drought losses is unlikely although 
some areas are still far below normal in soil moisture 
norton d strommen the usdas chief meteorologist says 
precipitation from now until the end of april can further improve 
soil moisture levels and yield potential of wheat areas in the 
great plains 
also he said monday timely spring and summer rains along with 
favorable temperatures will be the key to crop prospects this 
summer there is little correlation between drought indicators 
this winter and prospective crop yields for 1989 strommen said

a preacher who authorities say has seduced and 
abused 100 boys for at least two decades was sentenced tuesday to 2 
years in prison for child sodomy 
mario tony leyva a selfordained pentecostal preacher who 
still faces a sentencing on federal charges took the stand in 
roanoke county circuit court and apologized for lying in september 
when he told jurors he had never committed any homosexual acts with 
minors 
but judge kenneth trabue chastised leyva as he upheld the 
sentence jurors had recommended when they convicted him of 
performing oral sodomy on two teenage boys 
i suppose the thing that troubles me most is somebody of the 
cloth who knows the truth has openly and flagrantly lied trabue 
told leyva 43 of columbus ga there was an overt effort to 
poison the jury on your behalf 
assistant commonwealths attorney randy leach agreed not to press 
perjury charges against leyva as part of a deal in which leyva and 
two fellow preachers pleaded guilty to federal charges that they 
shipped young boys across state lines on the southern revival 
circuit to use them in illegal sex acts 
leyva rias edward morris and freddie m herring could be 
sentenced by late february or early march in us district court 
the three ministers pleaded guilty in october to charges they used 
the tony leyva evangelistic association inc based in columbus to 
gain access to young boys through the years 
leyva had been abusing boys since at least the 1960s when he was 
a preacher in north carolina the fbi said morris 47 was leyvas 
ministry organist and herring 50 was founder of the lighthouse 
assembly in douglasville ga their plea agreements call for maximum 
sentences of 20 years in prison for leyva and 15 years each for 
morris and herring 
morris and herring were not charged in the state case 
during leyvas state trial in september he called his young 
accusers liars and said their stories of sexual abuse were prompted 
by people out to get him but when leyva decided to reach a plea 
bargain with federal prosecutors the fbi made him provide a 
detailed account of the sex acts that had gone on for years in his 
ministry 
lawyers said that since leyvas testimony in federal court 
contradicted his sworn claim of innocence in state court he had to 
recant the earlier testimony 
ive recanted on the statements and wish to beg the courts 
forgiveness for the statements which were not true leyva told 
the judge tuesday

the dusky seaside sparrow a small florida bird 
that became extinct despite a multimilliondollar effort to preserve 
it may not have been a true subspecies after all but just a 
routine member of a bird family still thriving all along the 
atlantic coast 
john c avise a university of georgia professor of genetics 
said tuesday that a comparison of random samples of genes from the 
dusky with those of other atlantic coast seaside sparrows shows 
almost no difference suggesting that efforts to prevent the duskys 
extinction were not justified 
the genetic results suggest that the magnitude of genetic 
distinction of the dusky from other atlantic coast populations of 
seaside sparrows is very small said avise in fact we didnt 
detect any differences really 
the professor said the us fish and wildlife service was 
required by law to try to protect the small bird because the sparrow 
was officially identified as a true subspecies but avise said that 
based on a modern comparison of the birds genetic makeup it 
appears the sparrow known as dusky was not unique 
at the time they the fish and wildlife service acted it was 
appropriate to try to save the dusky based on the available 
information that they had said avise in hindsight it may have 
been questionable as to whether the distinctiveness of that 
population was sufficiently great to have warranted the attention 
that it received 
elizabeth lipscomb a fish and wildlife service spokeswoman said 
experts with the federal agency are familiar with avises study but 
believe its a little preliminary to consider the dusky to not be 
a subspecies because it genetic research is such a new 
technique she said the agency has delisted dusky which she 
said means the bird is considered a distinct and extinct subspecies 
avise said the efforts to save the dusky were based on the 
existing classification or taxonomy of the bird 
many of those taxonomies were erected back the last century or 
early in this century on sometimes very questionable very limited 
data bases he said if genetic relationships had been established 
using modern molecular science the dusky probably would not have 
been identified as a subspecies and it probably would not have 
been given any special consideration said avise 
avise and a colleague william s nelson report in this weeks 
journal science that they compared the pattern of 11 genetic markers 
in the dusky seaside sparrow with the pattern found in five other 
seaside sparrow subspecies 
the research showed the report said that the dusky had 
essentially no difference in evolutionary history and genetic 
pattern than other atlantic coast populations of ammondramus 
maritimus seaside sparrow 
based on the genetic pattern comparison the study said the last 
dusky seaside sparrow appears to have been a routine example of 
the atlantic coast phylad of seaside sparrow 
cape canaveral in florida was the only known natural habitat for 
the dusky seaside sparrow the bird was numerous until the 1940s 
when spraying for mosquitoes and draining of swampland led to its 
decline at one point a 5000acre reserve costing 3 million was 
purchased in an effort to save the dusky 
the last five dusky seaside sparrows all males were captured 
several years ago and taken to a refuge on discovery island in walt 
disney world the last of these birds died last june

thallium poisoning possibly from acid rain caused 
the mysterious hair loss suffered by 150 children under the age of 
14 in a ukrainian city near the romanian border tass on tuesday 
quoted officials as saying 
but three months after the initial reports the ukrainian health 
ministry is still unable to calm parents in chernovtsy because it 
has been unable to determine where the thallium came from the 
official news agency reported 
the toxic metal has polluted the air and soil in the area since 
july and children have lost hair and suffered mild nervous and 
mental problems such as irritation and hallucinations tass said 
four children remain under treatment two at the kiev institute 
of pediarics and two in a sanatorium near kiev tass said 
pravda the communist party newspaper said in november that 
authorities suspected thallium as the cause of the childrens 
ailment soviet media speculated that contaminated gasoline or acid 
rain created by a romanian chemical plant might be at fault 
chernovtsy authorities are trying to reduce the amount of 
thallium in the air and soil by regularly washing downtown streets 
allowing only local drivers into the city center and banning all 
traffic one day a week tass said 
in addition all children in the city aged 5 to 14 will be sent 
to sanatoriums and pioneer camps during summer vacation 
thallium a rare poisonous bluishwhite soft metallic element 
is used in antiknock compounds photoelectric cells rat poisons and

friends of kitty dukakis said tuesday that despite 
the blow of her husbands presidential loss and her past problems 
with diet pill addiction they were shocked to learn of her sudden 
drinking problem 
i was very surprised said philip johnston the states human 
services secretary and a longtime friend of kitty and gov michael 
s dukakis 
i feel very close to her johnston said i think shes a 
very giving person shes very interested in other people warm 
giving and i guess vulnerable 
bonnie shershow an aide to mrs dukakis who traveled extensively 
with her during the presidential campaign and has stayed close since 
the election said there were absolutely no signs of problem 
drinking before nov 8 
shershow blamed the dramatic change in lifestyle that accompanied 
her husbands defeat by george bush 
i think that after a year and a half of a totally full schedule 
18 hours a day or more to go to none was very difficult 
shershow said 
im surprised i really am said marilyn chase who was mrs 
dukakis chief of staff for the campaign there wasnt any 
indication of that during the campaign 
chase and others said the governors wife had an occasional 
social drink while traveling but there was nothing excessive 
chase said i probably had more to drink than she did 
dukakis himself who has kept up his allbusiness demeanor since 
the election stuck to his public schedule after taking his wife to 
the edgehill newport alcohol treatment center sunday evening for the 
start of a 30day stay that will cost 7200 the dukakises spoke by 
telephone monday but the governor was in his statehouse office 
tuesday 
at an afternoon news conference the governor was asked whether 
in light of the defeats effect on his wife he would have done 
anything different in the running of his campaign 
no he said at first but then he added id run to win 
and shed probably be feeling better 
after the election by all outward appearances mrs dukakis was 
settling back into her role as the governors wife and coping with 
defeat in the campaign for the white house an office mrs dukakis 
was known to have pushed her husband to seek 
just last week she greeted the birth of her first grandchild a 
healthy baby girl born after a difficult pregnancy 
then came the revelation monday in a statement by the governor 
that kitty had used alcohol to excess always at home never in 
public on a number of occasions since the election 
dukakis and his wife have long fascinated massachusetts voters by 
their contrasts between his frugality and her taste in clothes 
between his emotional discipline and her mercurial temperament 
between his sometimes righteous selfcontrol and her chronic 
addiction to cigarettes 
in july 1987 mrs dukakis announced that she had recovered five 
years earlier from a 26year dependency on amphetamines that she 
took to control her weight the governors wife said she had 
conquered her addiction which she hid from her husband after 
undergoing treatment at a minnesota facility 
according to some friends and associates mrs dukakis was 
committed to the presidential race before her husband and may have 
wanted the white house more than he did now it appears that she 
took the defeat harder than her husband 
on the day after the election the governor took the trolley to 
the statehouse and plunged into a deskful of paperwork he waited 
weeks to take time off 
at the statehouse on tuesday the dukakises received dozens of 
phone calls and telegrams of a private nature all of them 
expressing support and concern dukakis spokeswoman susan kaplan 
said

pakistans ambassador to the united states said 
tuesday his nation is on the threshold of developing nuclear weapons 
but does not intend to build them preferring to seek accord with 
neighboring india 
it is right to say that we are one of the threshold states 
said ambassador jamsheed ka marker in what appeared to be the most 
explicit acknowledgement to date that pakistan is moving ahead on 
its nuclear weapons program and could develop the bomb if it chose 
we have deliberately chosen not to take the final step to 
build a bomb and test it because we dont think it is right 
marker said in an interview on the program american interests 
produced by public broadcasting stations wetatv of washington and 
wnettv of new york the interview is to be broadcast this weekend 
markers description of the pakistani program differed from past 
statements by officials of his government a press release from the 
pakistani embassy last thursday for example said emphasized what 
it called the peaceful nature of pakistans nuclear program and 
did not use such phrases as threshold states or final step 
or even acknowledge the existence of a military nuclear program 
us observers were uncertain how to interpret markers comments 
state department nongovernment and foreign diplomatic experts said 
they did not believe marker had intended to go beyond statements 
made in december by pakistani prime benazir bhutto that pakistan had 
a purely peaceful nuclear program 
if it is a new formulation of the pakistani position it would 
be significant at this moment said leonard spector an expert at 
the carnegie endowment who closely follows proliferation issues 
i would say it is a surprising statement said spector i 
would say it was a slip of the tongue rather than a new policy 
bhutto and her indian counterpart rajiv ghandi met in islamabad 
dec 31 and signed an agreement not to attack each others nuclear 
facilities viewed as a possible first step to a regional 
nonproliferation accord 
neither pakistan nor india have signed the 1968 nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty and they have fought three wars since 
achieving independence from britain in 1947 
a knowledgeable diplomatic source said marker had not intended to 
go beyond bhuttos formulation 
what he meant to say was the capability was there said the 
diplomat who spoke on condition he not be further identified it 
was in the form of questions and answer so it may have given the 
impression that he went further than bhutto 
pakistan wants to make sure it receives the same treatment in the 
international community as india which claims not to have an atomic 
arsenal but exploded what it called a peaceful nuclear device in 
1974 
to us it sounded like a bomb said marker we are 
exercising our nuclear option we will not remove this option until 
we get assurances of equality 
marker also said he was confident that pakistan would be 
certified as a nonnuclear nation by the bush administration a 
requirement congress has set before it will allow that nation to 
receive further military assistance

few members of congress spoke out for raising 
their pay tuesday as the proposal was soundly defeated but one who 
did presented his argument in human terms that won a large round of 
applause 
you know how hard you work and you shouldnt be embarrassed to 
say it rep dan rostenkowski dill told the house before it 
voted 38048 to reject the 51 percent raise and the senate followed 
suit 946 
the chairman of the house ways and means committee reminded 
colleagues the hardest thing you do is tell your families that 
they must sacrifice year in and year out 
sure there are perquisites that come with the job he said 
his voice rising but you know as well as i do that perks cant 
make up for the birthdays ball games holidays and meals that we 
miss when was the last time you skipped a town meeting for a school 
play if you cant remember ask your spouse 
you maintain two households but youre never home 
the house majority whip rep tony coelho dcalif said 
congress was engaged in an action that is surely selfdefeating 
by not taking the raise and coupling the increase with 
eliminating honoraria coelho said congress would continue a 
system of compensation that revolves around special interest money 
this is no victory it is a loss for the concept of leadership 
the score is easy to read ralph nader 1 national interest 
0 coelho added referring to the consumer advocate who was an 
outspoken opponent of the raise which had been proposed by a 
presidential commission and supported both by ronald reagan and 
president bush 
rep joseph d early dmass joined other speakers in 
predicting that federal executives and judges would leave federal 
service without more money 
countering arguments that judicial candidates are waiting in line 
to be nominated early said our concern should be whos in line 
he criticized colleagues for making reelection more important 
in this house than anything else the most important thing he 
said is longrange good government 
rep vic fazio dcalif introduced the resolution to reject the 
raise but said he did so only to face reality he then voted 
against his own rejection resolution 
he said that despite support from common cause the selfstyled 
citizens lobby we fell prey to the deception of the rabble 
rousers we became cartoon cannon fodder for trash television and 
talk radio 
he added there are supreme court justices who make less than 
their clerks the day after they the clerks retire and go into 
private practice

minister noboru takeshitas government 
saburo tsukamoto stepped down as chairman of the democratic 
socialist party he was the only one of four opposition members 
linked to the scandal who had refused to step down 
his departure opens the way for the opposition to unite and renew 
demands for takeshita and his entire cabinet to resign when 
parliament convenes friday 
many influential politicians and business leaders were offered 
cheap unlisted shares in recruitcosmos co a real estate 
subsidiary of the informationbased conglomerate recruit co 
shares rocketed in value immediately after they were offered for 
public trading in october 1986 tsukamoto admitted in december that 
he earned about 77000 in the transaction 
such lucrative dealings already have led to more than 20 
resignations including those of three cabinet ministers of the 
governing liberal democratic party and three other opposition 
members 
the transactions are not illegal but they have incited public 
outrage and raised questions of political ethics 
takeshita has denied any knowledge of recruit stock trading by 
his secretary and has ruled out opposition demands that he resign 
and call an early election 
instead he has pledged to restore public trust in politics 
tsukamoto also denies wrongdoing the 61yearold party chief 
resigned only after party elders demanded he take responsibility for 
tarnishing the name of the third largest opposition group as it 
prepares for a major legislative election in july 
if my resignation can bring gains for the party i decided it 
is better for me to withdraw now said tsukamoto the party

federal officials on tuesday warned banks 
against accepting benefits from financial management firms in 
exchange for placing bank funds in investments sponsored by those 
firms 
the office of the comptroller of the currency in a circular sent 
to national banks and examiners said a number of national bank 
trust departments may have accepted incentives from firms that 
sponsor mutual funds or other investment funds in return for putting 
bank assets in funds offered by the firms 
it said the incentives appear to have included discounts or 
rebates on fees for other services such as accounting and 
administrative work computer goods or services and seminars and 
travel expenses for bank personnel 
the memo reminded banks that their investment decisions should be 
based exclusively on the best interest of trust customers 
it said bank laws prohibit bank trust departments from 
receiving any financial benefits including discounts or rebates on 
goods or services purchased or other items of value in exchange 
for investing trust funds in particular investments 
trustees must not place themselves in a position where their 
judgments concerning the optimal investment for trust accounts may 
be influenced by the trustees receipt of financial benefits for 
selecting a particular investment the banking circular said 
the comptroller said banks that accept prohibited financial 
benefits may be subject to significant liability for breaching 
their duty and to enforcement action by the comptrollers office and 
may be required to provide reimbursement for the benefits

while house speaker jim wright rapped 
his gavel in washington for a vote rejecting the congessional pay 
raise some of his constituents in texas were sounding off against 
the man they put in office 
calls by fort worth residents to a klifam radio talk show 
tuesday were highly critical of wrights handling of the proposed 
increase the callers were not required to identify themselves and 
few did 
im very disgusted in jim wright said one caller im 
going to work as hard as i can to get him out of office 
another caller told listeners if theres someone running 
against him wright who has some decent qualifications theres no 
doubt that i would probably think twice about voting for jim 
wright 
wright had planned to let the 45500 increase take effect 
automatically on wednesday without a vote in the house but pressure 
from his colleagues and public outrage finally forced his hand and 
on tuesday the pay raise was overwhelmingly voted down 
some callers to the radio show were disturbed that wright was not 
explaining his position to them 
i really feel that jim wrights opinion of my opinion doesnt 
amount to a bucket of warm spit a caller said i wrote him i 
sent him a tea bag i called his office and so far ive gotten 
two copies of the same letter saying he wasnt going to do 
anything 
wright told the fort worth star telegram on jan 26 that he 
expected to be ridiculed for some of his decisions 
the speaker is supposed to take some heat if youre a leader 
in an institution youre expected to be a lightning rod im 
doing the best i can to put it in perspective sometimes that is 
difficult for a congressional leader 
letters to the star telegrams opinioneditorial page over the 
past few days have said wright has lost sight of what his job should 
be in washington 
kester m hearn of fort worth wrote in a letter published sunday 
speaker jim wright is preventing members of congress from being 
representatives by denying them a right to vote on the raise 
therefore he must be opposed to representative government he 
should quit posing as a representative and come home 
wright has enjoyed tremendous support over the years from voters 
in his home district in november he was elected to an 18th term 
without opposition despite being the subject of an ethics 
investigation by his house colleagues

national drug directordesignate william j 
bennett told the us conference of mayors on tuesday the war on 
drugs is emphatically the business of the federal government 
not just the states and cities 
i dont have any ambiguity about the federal role in the war on 
drugs said bennett who as education secretary under former 
president reagan argued that schools were chiefly the 
responsibility of state and local authorities 
this is serious business he said this is the business of 
state and local governments but it is emphatically the business of 
the federal government 
the gathering of mayors including several who asked 
specifically for federal money to be granted directly to local 
governments to help fight drugs applauded bennetts remarks 
but bennett didnt say how much money he intends to try to 
provide to local authorities 
questioned later bennett said budget decisions will have to wait 
until he completes a national drug control strategy report it is 
due six months after he is confirmed by the senate as director of 
national drug control policy 
certainly some of the effort is going to take money youre 
going to see some progress and some movement on this issue very 
soon the sixmonth report is the critical document to me 
he told the mayors the report will be straight as secretary of 
education i played it straight called them as i saw them i will 
call this as i see it there will be no politics in this report 
the mayors are extremely worried about money because while the 
drug bill called for 275 million to be spent for justice assistance 
programs grants to state and local agencies in the current 
fiscal year only 220 million has been appropriated by congress 
reagans budget proposal for fiscal 1990 proposed no money for 
justice assistance although the drug bill called for 350 million 
rep william j hughes dnj chairman of the house 
subcommittee on crime told the mayors that while congress has 
passed a lot of legislation what we really have not done is we 
have not funded the programs realistically 
we have to get our fiscal house in order so we can 
realistically fund programs like the justice assistance programs so 
that we are once again full partners with state and local units of 
government thats where the battle takes place ninety percent 
of our enforcement takes place at the state and local level 
sen joseph r biden jr ddel chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee who fought for creation of a drug czar position for eight 
years told the mayors its about time we stop kidding the 
american people about what we will be able to do legislatively 
to end this problem we have enough laws at the federal level 
we have to see if they work 
biden said the drug bill could be fully funded by raising taxes 
on cigarettes beer and liquor saying were still 60 percent 
behind what the tax was in 1954 on those commodities if you 
have a better idea suggest it or stop saying you support the drug 
bill 
he predicted that congress would fully fund the drug bill 
approving legislation already introduced in both houses to add 16 
billion to this years spending the bills do not specify how to pay 
for that spending 
bennett said he will pay attention to the law enforcement end of 
the drug war but in the end in the real long run this is a 
question of values 
its asking an awful lot in moral courage to ask a 13yearold 
to give up what hes been hearing for a large part of his 13 years 
is the good life material goods money cars clothes he said 
bennett said bush is serious about this its his number one 
priority

rightist political leader 
roberto dabuisson on tuesday denied the governments renewed charge 
that he masterminded the 1980 assassination of roman catholic 
archbishop oscar arnulfo romero 
i have put up with the basest slanders for eight years and god 
and my conscience know that i had nothing to do with this 
reprehensible assassination he was quoted in an interview 
published tuesday in the daily la prensa grafica 
dabuisson said the christian democratic administration revived 
the accusation as a political maneuver before the march 19 
presidential election dabuisson is founder of the rightist 
national republican alliance known as arena leads the christian 
democrats in recent polls 
the government long has said dabuisson was the architect of the 
assassination but never cited any specific evidence backing up the 
charge 
on sunday a government television program said a commission 
investigating romeros death identified the gunman as hector antonio 
regalado 
regalado a dentist was security chief for the legislative 
assembly when dabuisson was assembly speaker news reports have 
linked regalado to the death squads dabuisson has been accused of 
organizing dabuisson also denies any role in the death squads 
romero an outspoken critic of death squad activity and human 
rights abuses by the military was killed by a lone marksman as he 
was saying mass in a chapel in the capital on march 24 1980 
nobody has been held in the slaying and regalados whereabouts 
were not immediately known 
the commission said amado antonio garay the driver for a former 
army captain alvaro saravia identified regalado from photographs 
as the gunman 
garay said saravia was the other passsenger on the day of the 
shooting and described dabuisson as the mastermind of the 
assassination 
saravia was arrested on immigration charges in miami in 1987 and 
the salvadoran government requested his extradition 
but the salvadoran supreme court in december overturned the 
extradition request before saravia could be returned to el salvador 
saying testimony linking him to the assassination was not credible 
saravia 46 was released last month from a miami jail and lives 
in the miami suburb of kendall his attorney says he is seeking 
political asylum 
in washington state department spokesman charles redman said the 
commissions announcement may reflect the salvadoran governments 
deep frustration with the failure of the judicial system to 
prosecute this notorious and longstanding case 
in light of the salvadoran supreme court action in withdrawing 
the extradition warrant for excapt saravia in december he was a 
potential witness in the case the government of el salvador 
through its minister of justice has evidently decided to make the 
facts known to the public he said 
redman said the united states believed the salvadoran supreme 
court made a serious error 
if that extradition warrant had been allowed to proceed the 
government of el salvador could have obtained critical information 
by which to prosecute this case we would hope that all leads would 
be investigated in this case in order to finally bring to justice 
those accused of committing this crime 
dabuisson is a legislator which gives him immunity from 
prosecution

a gym instructor who trained on a welsh 
mountainside bested an aerobics teacher tuesday in the annual shrove 
tuesday pancake race keeping the championship in english hands for 
the seventh consecutive year 
lesley byrne 26 of olney england ran her hometown 415yard 
course carrying a frying pan with a pancake in 62 seconds on the 
kansas course donetta schindler 23 won with a time of 6591 
seconds 
mrs byrne who also won last year said she trained by running 
down the highest mountain in the snowdonia range the 3560foot 
snowdon in northern wales 
im thrilled to have won but i think the wind stopped me from 
breaking the record she said my legs feel really bad i 
thought i was fitter because id been training ill be coming back 
next year to try for the hattrick three wins 
mrs schindler passed 14 competitors in liberal 
i felt like i was in good position said mrs schindler a 
former star tennis player at liberal high school i was ready for 
it but i had not trained that much 
most of her training for the race which she was running for the 
first time came from her job she said 
mrs schindlers sister sheila turner set the record for the 
liberal pancake race in 1975 with a time of 585 seconds the olney 
record is 598 seconds 
according to legend the race has been run in olney since 1445 
when a harassed housewife dashed to church on shrove tuesday still 
clutching her frying pan with a pancake in it others say pancakes 
may have been a form of bribe to the bellringer to ring the bell 
sooner to signal the beginning of the feast day celebrations 
after a lapse during world war ii olney revived the race in 
1948 two years later the women of liberal in southwest kansas 
challenged the english to see who could come up with the best time 
liberal won nine straight in the 1970s to build up a 1913 lead 
but olney now holds the edge at 2019 
after tuesdays race in liberal was finished shortly after noon 
officials here telephoned england with the results and the winners 
exchanged congratulations 
about 1000 spectators turned out for the liberal race in spite

nursing hangovers and sore feet 
brazilians and tourists tuesday reveled in a final round of brazils 
worldfamous carnival four days of practically nonstop dancing 
partying and seemingly endless parades 
throughout latin americas largest country from the steamy 
amazon to the concrete jungles of industrial sao paulo people shed 
their inhibitions and clothes to dance in the streets and in private 
clubs to the rhythmic and almost hypnotic beat of samba drums 
the merrymaking will continue through noon on ash wednesday when 
carnival officially ends and stores banks and government offices 
reopen

took place in rio de janeiro which once again hosted a spectacular 
parade of samba schools actually neighborhood groups from poor 
and mainly black districts 
for hours on end from sunday to tuesday tens of thousands of 
cheering spectators watched these schools march down the citys 
brightly lit sambadrome a parade ground flanked by huge 
concrete grandstands 
the schools of up to 4000 members each work the whole year 
on their colorful costumes and floats and rehearse the original 
lyrics and dance steps for the big parade 
the parades always have a strong dose of eroticism as beautiful 
women either barebreasted or scantily clad in string bikinis dance 
exuberantly along the parade route or on top of the floats 
along rio de janeiros famous copacabana and ipanema beaches 
brazilians and foreigners danced to the throbbing beat of impromptu 
samba bands and occasionally took a dip in the ocean 
the wealthy partied in private clubs that threw wild and 
glittering balls in which feathers or strings of beads passed as 
costumes

michael jackson thrilled hundreds of 
youngsters tuesday in a lightning visit to cleveland elementary 
school where five students were killed and 30 injured by a demented 
drifter armed with a rifle 
i think theyll remember this for a long time said stockton 
unified school district spokesman john klose 
later the entertainer paid a brief visit to san joaquin general 
hospital where two young victims of the attack are still being 
treated 
hundreds of people gathered outside the school hoping to spot the 
pop superstar but he was whisked into a rear entrance in a 
limousine and left the same way after about 20 minutes inside 
he visited classrooms where kindergarten first second and 
thirdgrade students were gathered then dropped in on an assembly 
of fourth through sixthgraders no reporters or photographers were 
allowed to watch as jackson met with the youngsters 
he just smiled and thats it said 6yearold lanisha who 
said she couldnt remember her last name and then he left 
hannah schardt 11 of stockton attends another school but came 
with her mother to see jackson 
he just made a peace sign and left right away after about five 
seconds she said he just kind of said hi and nodded 
barbara knox of stockton brought her 2yearold son xzavier 
to see michael jackson to get a glimpse of him his hair his 
glove it doesnt matter 
jackson wearing a dark militarystyle jacket with red epaulets 
spent a few minutes at the hospital with vann sa 7 and long keo 6 
it was not what i would call a dialogue said hospital 
spokeswoman sharon booker it was an appearance but five to seven 
minutes with michael jackson what can you compare it to 
he was very warm very pleasant with the children said 
booker they were very excited to see him 
booker said vann sa would remain in the hospital for another week 
or so long keo was scheduled to be released wednesday 
monday night the stockton city council voted 90 for an 
ordinance outlawing the possession or sale inside the city limits of 
assault rifles like the sovietdesigned ak47 that patrick edward 
purdy used to attack the school on jan 17 before when he killed 
himself the los angeles city council voted likewise tuesday 
the stockton ordinance is a misdemeanor carrying only a 500 fine 
and a maximum of six months in jail maximum penalties for a city 
ordinance it takes effect in seven days after which any 
semiautomatic weapon found in the city would be confiscated as 
contraband and destroyed opponents said they would try to have the 
ban overturned

the city council voted unanimously tuesday to 
ban sales and possession of semiautomatic weapons such as the ak47 
rifle used to kill five schoolchildren in stockton last month 
holding aloft an uzi rifle councilman zev yaroslavsky said 
there is absolutely no reason why anyone should own one of these 
we are talking about offensive weapons of war 
after a noisy hourlong discussion by council members and the 
public many of them gun owners who opposed the measure the council 
voted 120 for the ban 
violators of the ordinance will face up to six months in jail and 
a fine of up to 1000 the ordinance applies to any semiautomatic 
rifle that holds 20 or more rounds or a semiautomatic shotgun that 
can be fired more than six times 
the measure was effective immediately owners of such guns have 
15 days to get rid of the firearms or make them inoperable 
mayor tom bradley calling the weapons tools of murder and 
mayhem whose sole purpose is killing human beings promptly signed 
the measure into law 
more than 100 people opposing the ordinance booed those speaking 
in favor of it forcing councilman marvin braude to demand quiet in 
council chambers several times 
robert cleaves of los angeles said violent crime will not be 
stopped by banning military lookalike weapons while citizen robert 
kahn contended the law would target lawabiding citizens instead of 
criminals 
some questioned the constitutionality of the law but city 
attorney james hahn said he believed it was constitutional saying 
it was insane to have ever allowed these weapons to have been 
sold 
yaroslavsky the sponsor of the ordinance said he believed that 
los angeles would be only one of many cities in the area to ban 
semiautomatic ak47s uzis and similar weapons 
indeed county supervisor kenneth hahn announced tuesday he will 
introduce an ordinance next week to make private ownership of 
assault rifles illegal in los angeles county 
the action follows a moves by councilman nate holden who last 
month began paying people up to 300 per gun to turn in the rifles 
holden is challenging bradley in the april 11 mayoral election 
outcry against assault rifles has been strong since the jan 17 
massacre in stockton where a drifter sprayed a school playground 
with more than 100 rounds from a semiautomatic version of an ak47 
killing five children 
former president reagan said monday that the weapons should be 
outlawed because they are not intended for hunting or protecting a 
home 
the stockton city council on monday unanimously adopted an 
ordinance banning assault rifles despite protests from gun owners 
who packed a meeting to argue that the ban was unconstitutional

five central american nations intend to ask 
the united nations on wednesday to send inspectors on surprise 
visits to guarantee that none of the five subverts a neighbor said 
nicaraguas foreign minister 
the minister miguel descoto said tuesday that he and the 
foreign ministers of honduras costa rica guatemala and el salvador 
reached basic agreement on the inspection plan when they met for 
presidential inaugurations in mexico in december and venezuela last 
week 
the ministers agreed that the unarmed civilian inspectors would 
be from spain canada and west germany said a source close to the 
talks who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the five will meet secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar on 
wednesday and descoto said he was optimistic their agreement on 
the plan would hold up 
the presidents of the five nations sent a letter to perez de 
cuellar last month proposing the inspection team he asked for 
details so the foreign ministers decided to meet in new york to 
speed the process said descoto 
he said he could not disclose the details until after all five 
ministers present the proposal and perez de cuellar makes his 
recommendations 
the inspectors would check allegations that one nation was 
harboring rebels from another nation or supporting a rebellion 
which is banned under central american peace accords signed on aug 
7 1987 
on monday evening descoto suggested a small force possibly 10 
inspectors in each of the five capitals 
they would have to have access to every single part of the 
country and they would have to be able to visit every place without 
prior notification descoto said then the element of surprise 
is essential here 
the plan evolved from recommendations made by a joint 
unorganization of american states technical mission that visited 
central america in late 1987 
honduras which blocked accord on the plan at that time by 
refusing to allow inspections of military sites now agrees on a 
plan to ask the secretarygeneral to set up the inspection teams 
said descoto 
honduras is a key us ally where ussupported nicaraguan 
rebels known as contras have bases to launch raids into 
neighboring nicaragua 
the contras have faded as a military force since congress cut off 
funding for weapons some observers believe honduras would like to 
get them out of the country so nicaragua is not tempted to send in 
its superior military forces to mop up the contra bases 
the foreign ministers will hold talks wednesday and thursday to 
prepare for a summit by their five presidents in el salvador next 
monday and tuesday 
the ministers will also try to work out an agreement for 
monitoring the second part of the peace accords calling for 
democratization and political reforms 
descoto said nicaragua would propose an immediate regional open 
door policy in which the five nations would invite in the oas 
united nations amnesty international the international red cross 
and other agencies to monitor human rights 
the interamerican human rights commission would be responsible 
for verifying compliance that human civil and social rights were 
not abused the un working group on forced and involuntary 
disappearances would check on disappeared people and oas and 
un observers would monitor elections in the region under the 
nicaraguasponsored plan 
nicaraguan presidential elections are due in november 1990 and 
the contras are expected to field candidates said descoto he said 
he did not know if president daniel ortega would run for reelection 
descoto also called on the united states to join the five 
central american nations in an antidrug treaty 
it would be noble and good and christian said descoto who 
is also a roman catholic priest 
he had no details but he said nicaragua would not object to the 
us drug enforcement agency having an office in nicaragua

a house committee tuesday asked the general 
accounting office and the governments chief purchasing agent to 
investigate charges that federal agencies are restricting their 
computer procurements to favor ibm corp 
the investigation sought by the house committee on government 
operations follows a complaint last november by six ibm competitors 
that they effectively have been frozen out of much of the navys 
multibilliondollar computer market 
the gao congress watchdog arm was asked to supply to the 
committee within 60 days a broad evaluation of the extent that 
federal agencies restrict their procurements to ibm 
codecompatible systems 
although many of companies offer clones or duplicates of ibm 
systems at lower prices they complained in a letter to former 
defense secretary frank carlucci that navy procurement officials had 
tailored the bid specifications so that only ibm could win 
rep john conyers jr dmich the panels chairman cited 
government statistics indicating that ibm currently holds almost 55 
percent of the navys largescale computer base compared with the 
companys 37 percent share governmentwide 
the computer and telecommunications industry is one of the 
fastest growing and most highly compettive segments of the us 
economy conyers said yet if these allegations are true navy 
officials have apparently determined that only one company is 
capable of meeting their needs 
the committee also asked gao to look in more detail at 
codecompatible computer purchases by the army the national 
aeronautics administration and the health and human services and 
housing and urban development departments 
the general services administration which supervises all 
government purchases from vendors was asked by the committee to 
rescind blanket approval of navy computer purchases less than 10 
million and strengthen its oversight 
currently the government requires gsa to approve any purchase 
above 25 million but waivers raising the ceiling to 10 million 
have been given to some navy commands 
with expenditures of some 174 billion last year on computer 
communications and data processing equipment and services the 
government is the industrys largest single purchaser 
faced witrh enormous budget deficits congress cannot sit idely 
by while agencies needlessly waste scarce taxpayer dollars on 
solesource contracts conyers said

a judge empowered a man tuesday to authorize 
an abortion for his comatose wife in an effort to improve her 
chances of recovery but righttolife advocates immediately moved 
to overturn the decision 
three hours after state supreme court justice bernard mccaffrey 
named martin klein as his wifes guardian an appeals court judge 
granted two antiabortionists a stay blocking the ruling until an 
appeals panel could review it 
this has been very stressful and very tiring said a 
haggardlooking klein who had told reporters after the mccaffrey 
decision that all i want to do is save my wifes life 
his wife nancy 32 who is about 17 weeks pregnant has been in 
a coma at north shore university hospital in manhasset since a dec 
13 car accident 
klein 34 of upper brookville sought an abortion for his wife 
after some physicians who examined her said an abortion could save 
her life and assist in her recovery the hospital told klein it 
would need a court order to perform the abortion 
appellate division judge vincent balletta jr granted the stay to 
antiabortion activists john short of farmingdale and john broderick 
of syosset the full appellate division will rule on the case by the 
end of this week he said 
balletta issued the stay despite an appeal from elizabeth 
bradford of the state attorney generals office on behalf of klein 
the two activists hope to become legal guardians of both mrs klein 
and the fetus to block the abortion 
this case is not an abortion case its a guardianship case 
said ms bradford clearly if mrs klein was given the choice of 
husband of nine years versus a stranger she would opt for her 
husband 
kleins attorney sidney schutz has labeled the pair 
interlopers in a private family tragedy 
short the founder of the long island righttolife committee 
said mrs klein was closer to delivering a live child i hope that 
five years from now this child will be celebrating its fifth 
birthday 
earlier mccaffrey issued his decision in a courtroom packed with 
supporters and opponents of abortion reporters and relatives 
upon hearing the decision klein kissed and embraced his wifes 
parents anne and frederick zusselman of delray beach fla 
mccaffreys ruling followed a twoday hearing last week 
the judge said that based on medical testimony and records mrs 
klein is incompetent and a guardian should be appointed 
he gave klein permission to authorize any medical procedures that 
may be necessary to preserve his wifes life specifically ruling 
that klein is authorized to approve an abortion 
five medical experts testified on kleins behalf that pregnancy 
increased the risks for the comatose patient and could possibly 
threaten her life but the nassau county district attorney produced 
medical experts who testified the pregnancy was not lifethreatening 
mccaffrey decided that an abortion was not medically necessary to 
save mrs kleins life 
he noted that if mrs klein were competent it would be her sole 
decision to continue or terminate the pregnancy up to a 24week 
period for any reason without a judicial determination under law a 
fetus is considered viable meaning it can survive outside the womb 
after 24 weeks

nicaragua on tuesday denied 
allegations by two men charged in the slaying of a nicaraguan rebel 
leader that its diplomats planned the assassination 
the accusations are ridiculous and completely removed from the 
truth said nicaraguan embassy spokesman juan jose membrano we 
deny all involvement by our embassy in the assassination of the 
contra chief 
manuel rugama the rebel commander was shot and killed jan 7 
luis fernando ordonez reyes one of the arrested told an 
armyarranged news conference monday that the plan to eliminate 
rugama was prepared by the nicaraguan embassy in tegucigalpa 
rugama a physician was a regional commander of the usbacked 
rebels known as contras and had been a rebel for nine years in the 
war to bring down the leftist sandinista government in managua 
officers who found his body riddled with 26 bullets said he 
apparently was alone when he was shot while driving on a highway 
west of the honduran capital 
the contras blamed the nicaraguan government for rugamas 
slaying saying he was scheduled to meet with other contra leaders 
that day 
at the news conference ordonez said he introduced jose de jesus 
pena whom he identified as the nicaraguan embassy security chief 
to one of his employees a former police officer named rigoberto 
matute 
ordonez a nicaraguan who operated a money exchange in 
tegucigalpa said pena often visited his business and paid him 
between 500 and 1500 for information about antisandinista rebels 
in honduras 
membrano said the nicaraguan embassy has no security chief and 
that no one named jose de jesus pena worked there 
juan bautista nunez a former detective for the honduran national 
police said at the news conference that matute offered to pay him 
20000 to help in the killing 
i was the first to fire at rugama bautista said he said 
matute and a third man he knew only by his last name cano arteaga 
then joined in killing rugama 
matute nunez and ordonez are being held in the killing but 
there was no indication why matute did not attend the news

israel on tuesday defended its treatment of 
palestinians in the face of a us report that criticized israel for 
many avoidable deaths and injuries during the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied lands 
yossi ahimeir spokesman for prime minister yitzhak shamir said 
we are doing our utmost to prevent unnecessary suffering and 
bloodshed 
palestinian leaders welcomed the report by the state department 
as a sign of a more realistic us approach to the palestinian 
problem 
since the revolt began 14 months ago 374 palestinians have been 
killed and thousands wounded most by army gunfire 
deputy foreign minister binyamin netanyahu said on israel 
television that troops maintain as best they can apart from a few 
exceptions the standards of proper conduct that no country in the 
world could maintain 
the television quoted the armys chief prosecutor brig gen 
amnon strashnov as terming the report exaggerated and unjust 
in a separate statement strashnov defended the legality of 
israeli operations saying palestinian prisoners were given due 
process of law 
ahimeir told the associated press we are already used to these 
accusations we try to defend our security and sometimes people lose 
their lives we hope the moment the uprising comes to an end life 
will return to normal 
palestinian feisal husseini a leading proplo activist who was 
recently released from jail after spending most of the uprising 
under administrative detention said i believe this report will 
help in creating an understanding between palestinians and americans 
and i hope it is a sign of a new us policy 
hanna siniora editor of the east jerusalem daily alfajr said 
i dont think you can put on paper the suffering of the 
palestinian people and the human rights violations that have taken 
place in the last 14 months but it is a realistic report and we 
compliment the state department for taking such an attitude 
israels swift reaction coming even before the state department 
officially released its report indicated jerusalem was concerned 
the findings may figure in us policy toward israel the jewish 
state receives 3 billion a year in us military and economic aid 
the report comes at a time when israeli leaders are trying to 
persuade the united states to end its dialogue with the palestine 
liberation organization charging that the organization has broken 
its promise to abandon terrorism 
in clashes in the occupied west bank and gaza strip on tuesday 
soldiers shot and wounded five palestinians arab hospital officials 
said 
victims included an 18yearold struck in the neck with a plastic 
bullet and a 20yearold who was hit in the head both were in 
critical condition said the officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the army said it was checking the reports 
palestinians began the uprising in december 1987 to protest 
israeli rule of the west bank and gaza strip seized from jordan and 
egypt in the 1967 middle east war 
the us report said the revolt has led to a substantial 
increase in human rights violations 
soldiers frequently used gunfire in situations that did not 
present mortal danger to troops causing many avoidable deaths and 
injuries it said the report said authorities sometimes 
prosecuted or disciplined soldiers and jewish settlers who killed 
palestinians 
however regulations were not rigorously enforced punishments 
were usually lenient and there were many cases of unjustified 
killing which did not result in disciplinary actions or 
prosecutions according to the report 
it also said troops often arrest palestinians without warrants 
and demolish houses of people suspected but not convicted of 
antiisraeli violence 
in defending israels human rights record strashnov reported 
that of 21000 palestinians arrested since the start of the 
uprising 8000 have been indicted of those 4300 have been been 
convicted and 200 acquitted strashnov said others were awaiting 
trial he said 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
suggested the us report was biased 
when an army is fighting civilians you can never win the 
sympathy of the world he said 
human rights officials discounted israeli claims that human 
rights are protected in the territories 
the rights of individuals are violated on a massive scale 
said joost hiltermann a dutch researcher for al haqlaw in the 
service of man the west bank affiliate of the genevabased 
international commission of jurists 
he said for example that evidence against administrative 
detainees and palestinians facing deportation is routinely kept 
secret for security reasons and that defendants cannot respond to 
charges

michael dukakis left more than 26 million to 
pay for shutting down his democratic presidential campaign 
operation while republican george bush spent almost everything he 
had to win the white house their financial reports showed 
dukakis campaign treasurer robert a farmer said tuesday the 
massachusetts governor is the sort of man who does not want a 
debt 
during the campaign dukakis fostered a public image of frugality 
and bragged about having a 25yearold snowblower to clear his 
driveway 
if youre prudent you keep a reserve to pay your expenses 
farmer said 
however there was some confusion among dukakis aides over how 
the surplus was reported 
we definitely did not run a surplus said jack corrigan a 
campaign aide to dukakis who how works for him in the governors 
office 
nevertheless corrigan said he could not explain the figures on 
the campaigns financial report filed with the federal election 
commission 
the leftover money comes from the 461 million bush and dukakis 
each got from the federal treasury to pay for their general election 
campaigns under federal election laws candidates using public 
money in the general election cannot also use private money for the 
campaign 
however the law does allow the candidates to raise money for the 
sole purpose of covering the costs of legal and other expenses 
involved in closing down their operations after the election 
the candidates can cover these expenses with money they got from 
the federal government but that drains cash away from the campaign 
to win the election said fred eiland a spokesman for the federal 
election commission 
while the bush campaign ended with a surplus of just under 
70000 its november victory gives it the ability to raise more 
money if its needed to close down 
however dukakis does not have that ability farmer said on top 
of losing the presidential election he announced he would not run 
for reelection in next years gubernatorial election 
my understanding is we spent almost to the nickel the amount of 
money we could spend on the campaign he said 
farmer said it may take two years to close out the campaign 
dukakis yearend report filed with the federal election 
commission showed he wound up with more than 39 million in cash 
with outstanding debts of nearly 13 million 
the same report for bush showed he had 272359 in cash at the 
end of the year and had 202537 in debts 
democrat gary hart and republican bob dole ended their campaigns 
in the black hart a former senator from colorado wound up with 
155876 in the bank and 2156 in debts while dole the senate 
minority leader had 28098 in cash and 1682 in debts 
sen paul simon dill and republican pete du pont of delaware 
also ended the year with their campaigns out of debt simon had 
454360 in cash and 94346 in debts while du pont had 50799 in 
cash and didnt owe anything according to their fec reports 
television evangelist pat robertsons campaign for the gop 
presidential nomination ended the year in debts with 516158 in 
bills with just 19420 in the bank sen joseph biden ddel also 
ended in the red with 53332 in debts and 5180 in cash according

a resolution opposing the purchase of 
montgomerys dominant commercial television station by the state 
pension system failed to pass the alabama house on tuesday 
the resolution was turned back after a debate pitting concern 
over government control of the news media versus the possibility of 
financial losses by the agency overseeing teacher and government 
pensions 
gov guy hunt filed a petition monday with the federal 
communications commission to block the license transfer of wsfatv 
to the retirement systems of alabama which has agreed to purchase 
the station for 70 million 
the house resolution sponsored by rep richard laird of roanoke 
required a fourfifths majority to pass it got a majority 3327 
but not a big enough margin for approval 
we too often have government entities financed with taxpayers 
money competing with the private sector the free enterprise system 
thats the bottom line laird said of the purchase it is wrong 
we need to keep government out of the free enterprise system 
rep roy johnson of tuscaloosa urged the lawmakers to leave the 
battle to hunt and david bronner who is in charge of investing the 
state pension systems 8 billion portfolio 
bronner has said the state pension system would lose 10 million 
now held in escrow if the state defaults on the acquisition of wsfa 
from cosmos broadcasting inc of greenville sc 
theres some concern on the part of literally thousands of 
retirees across the state who look at the prospects of losing 10 
million johnson said 
but rep morris mo brooks of huntsville said the transaction 
strikes at the heart of democracy 
in no way should the state of alabama the united states of 
america or any other governmental entity get into the business of 
controlling directly or indirectly what can or cannot be printed 
in our media or spoken on our news in the radio and tv markets 
said brooks

france said tuesday that global support for a ban 
on chemical weapons depends on effective security guarantees for the 
nations without them 
foreign minister roland dumas told the 40nation geneva 
disarmament conference quick agreement on that issue could convince 
nations that now hesitate over the proposed treaty 
swedish delegate maj britt said at the first 1989 session the 
conference is racing against time because further refinement 
development and spread of chemical weapons seriously undermine our 
efforts 
a treaty can be ready in 1990 or even earlier if all 
participants have the political will she said 
dumas said it is absolutely crucial that a comprehensive 
approach be taken to undiminished security for all countries 
during the initial 10year treaty period in which all stocks of 
chemical weapons would be destroyed 
that would require plans ranging from an order of destruction for 
existing stocks to sanctions on countries which delay the process 
or evade their obligactions he declared 
france has dropped a proposal which obtained no other support 
that each country be allowed a security stock of chemical 
weapons during the 10year destruction period 
the french abandoned the idea after president francois mitterrand 
announced to the un general assembly last fall that his country 
does not have chemical weapons and will not produce any when a 
treaty takes effect 
dumas told a news conference tuesday his government hopes the 
geneva negotiations which began in 1980 will finish soon with a 
treaty that can take effect quickly 
although it does not envisage production of chemical weapons he 
said france must limit its commitments because it cannot exclude 
a failure of the negotiations 
tuesdays session began with an appeal by javier perez de 
cuellar the un secretarygeneral for more rapid progress 
he said the special conference on chemical weapons attended by 
149 nations in paris last month reflected the worlds consensus to 
conclude a treaty at the earliest date 
i very much hope that this commitment undertaken at such a 
high political level will accelerate the pace of your 
negotiations his message said 
max friedersdorf chief us delegate told the conference the 
paris meeting provided real impetus 
it is our challenge now to seize this moment and to search for 
practical solutions to the problems that remain he said in his 
brief speech monitoring complience is clearly the major 
difficulty friedersdorf said

after tuesdays verdict brigham continued to prophesize that the 
soviet policy of glasnost or openness signaled a more peaceful 
world by the year 2001 telling the court that people had 12 years 
to adjust

firstdegree murder and sentenced to life in prison last june the 
quebec court of appeal ordered a new trial citing four errors made 
by the presiding judge

the defense minister argued 
tuesday against accepting a rebel proposal to delay the march 19 
presidential election and said he thought the rebels were trying to 
drive a wedge between the military and civilians 
the rebel farabundo marti liberation front said earlier tuesday 
that the armed forces make up the real power in el salvador and 
that the proposal would fail without military support 
the defense chief gen carlos eugenio vides casanova said 
postponing the election from march to september as the rebels 
suggested could mean defeat for mainstream presidential candidates 
and hamper the military in its 9yearold war against the leftist 
guerrillas 
on friday us vice president dan quayle said during a oneday 
visit to el salvador that the bush administration will back 
president jose napoleon duarte if he agrees to the rebel request for 
a sixmonth election postponement 
duarte initially attacked the rebels jan 23 proposal as 
unconstitutional because it would change the constitutionally 
mandated march election date 
us officials however felt the proposal was worth looking into 
because of the insurgents firstever offer to join the election 
process without demanding powersharing as a precondition 
in a telephone call from nicaragua broadcast by a local radio 
station a rebel spokesman on tuesday read a statement asking the 
armed forces to take a public position on postponing the election 
vides casanova obliged during a news conference 
he said the armed forces do not believe this is a serious 
proposal 
if you want your candidates to lose go ahead and do it he 
said in remarks directed to politicians now considering the 
postponement 
el salvadors political parties are trying to arrive at a joint 
position on the rebel proposal 
vides casanova said the military would stand behind whatever 
decision political leaders reached but he cautioned that postponing 
the election would hand over all the advantages to the left 
the farabundo marti offered to abandon its longstanding election 
boycott and take an indirect role in the electoral process if 
balloting is postponed six months the rebels said they would abide 
by election results if their conditions are met 
they added an offer to negotiate a 60day ceasefire with the 
armed forces in the broadcast tuesday 
vides casanova said he suspected the rebels of a divide and 
conquer strategy 
we think they are trying to create a division between the armed 
forces and the organs of state and an internal division within the 
armed forces he said 
by the farabundo martis own assessment vides casanovas 
negative reaction to the rebel proposal could sound the death knell 
for the plan 
if this proposal could really bring peace to the nation we 
would be obliged to accept it the general said but it is our 
judgment that it is not going to bring peace that it is only going 
to aggravate conditions in the country

customers besieged banks tuesday 
to acquire us dollars pushing the value of the inflationbattered 
argentine national currency down by 25 percent and intensifying the 
nations economic crisis 
the long lines of depositors waiting to change australs for 
dollars resulted from the central banks decision sunday night to 
restrict dollar sales in an attempt to stabilize the austral and 
hold down inflation 
financial houses were closed monday while the government grappled 
with ways to combat the latin american nations economic travails 
which have forced it to keep interest rates high in order to prevent 
a freefall in the austral 
argentines who gathered outside foreignexchange services early 
tuesday found they had to pay up to 26 australs for the dollar they 
could have purchased for 1759 australs on friday but those who had 
dollars received 21 australs or more compared with 1751 on friday 
during the day the austral kept slipping and by the time 
financial houses closed a dollar fetched 2320 australs it cost 
2350 australs to buy a dollar 
the central bank during the past several months has tightened 
interest rates and taken other steps to support the austral and 
restrain inflation 
but the 68 percent inflation rate in december and 89 percent 
rate in january were worse than expected and suggested to many 
argentines that the governments policies arent working 
inflation in 1988 soared 387 percent 
on monday the government announced it would maintain a 
threetiered exchange rate system the official rate a special 
rate that is 25 percent higher and the black market or free 
rate 
the special rate replaces a rate used to determine how much 
industrial exporters would be paid in australs for their dollars 
farm exporters are required to sell most of the dollars to the 
government at the lower official rate 
argentines who were unhappy with the old system arent happy with 
the new one either 
farm exporters who provide the bulk of argentinas foreign 
exchange earnings grumbled that while the special rate is 
marginally higher than the official rate they still have to sell 
most of their dollars to the central bank at a little more than 14 
australs to the dollar 
businessmen said interest rates which have made borrowing 
prohibitive arent likely to come down even with the exchange rate 
changes

congress voted overwhelmingly tuesday to turn 
down its 51 percent pay raise and rushed the legislation to 
president bush who signed it hours before a midnight deadline 
lawmakers were anxious to end the public outcry against the 
45500 increase which left them feeling in the words of one 
representative like cannon fodder for trash television and talk 
radio 
first the house voted to reject the raise by a vote of 38048 
less than three hours later the senate followed suit by a vote of 
946 
the raise would have become law at midnight without bushs 
signature on the resolution rejecting it bush had supported the 
raise but went along with congress signing the measure hours after 
the congressional votes 
the votes also denied large raises for top federal executives and 
federal judges the constitution forbids judicial raises from being 
scaled back once they have taken effect 
bush had supported the pay raise and said in a statement tuesday 
night that i believe some level of pay increase is in order and i 
will be working with the house and senate leadership to develop 
proposals to achieve that end he cited a special concern 
about judges pay 
some lawmakers predicted that defeating the raises would 
accelerate an exodus of judges and federal managers from government 
service 
indeed chief justice william h rehnquist said in a statement 
i deeply regret the congressional action which has prevented 
the federal judges in this country from receiving a welldeserved 
pay raise we will not be able to attract and retain the kind of 
judges we need unless we pay our judges fairly and equitably 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said bush told senate 
republicans tuesday he might ask congress to approve lesser raises 
for the judges and executives 
with its votes congress rejected raises proposed by a 
presidential commission and endorsed by thenpresident reagan 
senators and representatives would have seen their salaries rise 
from 89500 to 135000 
during its less than 30 minutes of debate the senate heard jesse 
helms rnc and a foe of the raise proclaim that the vote shows 
the american people that you can fight city hall and you can take 
on the congress of the united states with all its legerdemain and 
all its legislative ability 
the senate last week voted 955 against the raise but the 
wording of that resolution differed from the house version approved 
tuesday sen james jeffords rvt who had voted against the 
raise voted for it tuesday 
jeffords said he cast his vote tuesday to make clear his view 
that judges are badly in need of a pay raise and because unlike 
last weeks measure this one did not curtail lawmakers rights to 
make speeches for fees 
the other senators voting to sustain the raise were democrats 
christopher dodd of connecticut edward kennedy of massachusetts and 
spark matsunaga of hawaii and republicans frank murkowski of alaska 
and ted stevens of alaska 
despite the overwhelming house margin members were clearly torn 
between their desire for a pay raise and the public scorn heaped 
upon them for considering the increase 
the chamber applauded loudly when rep dan rostenkowski dill 
told colleagues in a rousing speech before the vote each member 
of this house democrat and republican is worth a salary of 
135000 a year 
the irony of the houses dilemma was reflected when rep vic 
fazio dcalif a pay raise defender introduced the resolution to 
reject the increase but voted against the resolution 
we face reality here today fazio said were doing what 
has become inevitable 
fazio chided his colleagues for not having the courage to speak 
out in their own defense and said we became cartoon cannon 
fodder for trash television and talk radio he added there are 
supreme court justices who make less than their clerks the day after 
they the clerks retire and go into private practice 
left dangling by congress action were ethics reforms that 
lawmakers had hoped to pass once the raise became law 
these included a ban on fees for speeches and appearances in both 
houses a bipartisan house negotiating group also had agreed to do 
away in 1991 with a legal loophole that allowed 190 house members 
those in office before 1980 to accumulate 39 million in leftover 
campaign cash which can be converted to personal use 
this issue isnt over said rep tom tauke riowa a leading 
opponent of the pay raise who said the congress must deal this year 
with pay for judges and bureaucrats as well as the questions 
involved in honoraria and other forms of outside income for 
lawmakers 
rep jerry lewis rcalif and one of those who negotiated the 
package of reforms said hes never seen a legislative body that 
was anything but clumsy in dealing with levels of pay 
but he added that in rejecting the raise the house will be 
reflecting the voices of the people regarding their attitude toward 
congressional pay 
raise opponents cleared the path for rejection votes in both 
houses monday after they engineered the collapse of house speaker 
jim wrights suggested alternative for a 30 percent pay increase 
the speaker planned to let the full raise become law at 1201 
am wednesday and then schedule a thursday vote to scale back the 
increase to 30 percent coupled with the planned honoraria ban the 
raise of 26850 would have amounted to a dollarfordollar trade 
for those earning the fee limit 
besides the raise for members of congress the presidential 
commission had proposed 
increasing the presidents pay from 200000 to 350000 and the 
vice presidents from 115000 to 175000 the raises would not 
have affected president bush or vice president dan quayle 
raising the salaries of top federal officials now in the range 
of 75000 to 99500 to a range of 115000 to 155000 
hiking the salary of the chief justice from 115000 to 175000 
and the salaries of associate justices of the supreme court from 
110000 to 165000 
raising the pay of federal appellate judges from 95000 to 
140000 and that of federal district judges from 89500 to 
135000 
retired congressmen presidents vice presidents top federal 
officials and federal judges would also have received higher 
pensions under the commissions proposal

japan seeking a larger role in dealing with third 
world debt problems wants to gain a bigger voice in the 
internatonal monetary fund by putting in more money a highranking 
imf official said tuesday 
but us reluctance to have its power diluted by larger japanese 
contributions to organizations like the imf is slowing japans 
attempts to assume greater responsibility the official said 
japan wishes to make a special japanese contribution to the 
imfs capital which would enable it to obtain a higher stronger 
position within the imf hermann onno christiann ruding chairman 
of the imfs interim committee told reporters 
most members of the imf including japan want to see a 
stronger imf and world bank and that implies a larger capital quota 
for the imf said ruding 
ruding said he supports japans desire to increase its 
contribution to the imf as well as a proposal to raise the imfs 
total capital fund by between 50 and 100 percent 
but the united states which holds enough power to veto measures 
it does not support was not convinced of the need for a larger 
capital fund and has been reluctant to support a substantial quota 
increase ruding said 
imf contributions determine members voting power and provide 
resources for loans to developing nations the united states holds 
the largest share of voting power 1901 percent and japan ranks 
fifth with 47 percent imf decisions require 85 percent support he 
said 
at an imf meeting last april former finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa called for japans share to be raised to match its economic 
stature

a former congressman who was forced to leave 
office after contracting lyme disease urged his former colleagues 
tuesday to support new legislation to pay for research and education 
efforts for the tickborne disease 
berkley w bedell an iowa democrat who served in the house for 
12 years said public education is badly needed for the disease 
which activists said is second only to aids as the most widespread 
new infectious disease of the 1980s 
bedell who left office in 1987 because of the disease returned 
to capitol hill on tuesday to support legislation by reps george 
hochbrueckner dny and sam gejdenson dconn to provide 25 
million annually for three years for research and treatment grants 
and another 1 million a year for education 
education is vital if we are to minimize the effects of this 
rapidly growing and very serious disease gejdenson said we 
need to know more about how the disease spreads what its effects 
are and how to treat it 
bedell 67 said he has an irregular heartbeat suffers from 
arthritis experiences loss of memory and tires easily due to the 
affliction but he said his condition was diagnosed quickly and 
treated others often do not realize they have the disease until it 
becomes debilitating 
karen vanderhoofforschner of tolland conn who has become a 
leading activist for lyme disease education and research said she 
contracted the disease while pregnant and passed it on to her son 
ms vanderhoofforschner is president of lyme borreliosis foundation 
inc a nonprofit foundation in connecticut devoted to education on 
the disease

undiagnosed for lyme disease she told a news conference her son 
now is blind and deaf and must be fed intravenously due to the 
disease

about 2500 workers have gone on strike for 
higher pay at a coal mine and electric power plant in central 
poland government and union spokesmen said tuesday 
the stoppage began monday at the belchatow brown coal mine and 
power plant about 90 miles southwest of warsaw but it has not 
interrupted electric service provided by the plant one of the 
largest generating stations in poland 
on strike are employees in the plants repair department and 
workers who deliver coal to the power station from the mine said 
government spokesman jerzy urban 
they are seeking pay increases of 59 a month an amount 
considered unfeasible by management the state pap news service 
said it was not immediately known what the workers current wages 
are 
the mine continued to function tuesday during negotiations with 
management said wojciech maziarski a spokesman in warsaw for the 
outlawed solidarity trade union movement but workers have 
threatened to shut down the mine beginning wednesday unless their 
demands are met he said 
maziarski said the solidarity leader lech walesa meeting with 
communist government officials in an effort to legalize the 
organization is sending two personal representatives to the 
strikers presumably to try to moderate in the dispute 
urban said the strike was symptomatic of alarming wage 
pressures breaking out across poland he said 173 pay disputes were 
reported to the government in january compared to about a third 
that number in december 
thirtynine of the january disputes resulted in strikes the 
longest lasting four days he said 
the government consistently applies the principle that these 
disputes are between the management and the workers and the 
management should pay as much as it can without threatening an 
enterprises finances urban said

mayor eugene sawyer denied he is beholden to the 
city council members who elected him saying tuesday in the citys 
only mayoral campaign debate that nobody has pushed me around 
sawyer went on the defensive quickly in the televised debate with 
frontrunning richard daley the cook county states attorney and 
son of the late longtime mayor richard j daley 
alderman lawrence bloom a longshot challenger opened by 
attacking sawyer he contended the mayors policies have been swayed 
by oldguard aldermen who elected him 14 months ago and are 
resistant to reform 
nobody has pushed me around nobody will push me around 
sawyer countered at the start of the live debate televised by public 
tv station wttw 
bloom also charged that electing either sawyer or daley probably 
will racially polarize the city 
people say white people are voting for daley becuase hes 
white black people are voting for sawyer because hes black 
bloom said maintaining that he a white alderman from the heavily 
black south side is the only candidate who can unite the city 
despite repeated complaints from bloom that he was not answering 
the questions daley refused to spar saying the public was 
concerned about issues such as education crime housing and taxes 
theyre sick and tired of a council fighting the personal 
attacks he said people are saying lets get on and talk about 
the real issues 
the 90minute debate was the only one scheduled among the three 
candidates before the feb 28 democratic primary 
bloom 45 had the most to gain from the debate observers said 
prior to the event 
lets just say its very important said michael meshenberg 
blooms campaign coordinator 
sawyer 54 had a technical advantage as the winner of two 
drawings that enabled him to deliver the opening and closing 
statements 
but one pundit said sawyer may have hurt his chances by 
unleashing a series of tv ads criticizing daleys intelligence on 
monday 
the debate is overrated but sawyer raised the stakes by those 
commercials and in effect daley can put him away by not doing 
anything more than acting like a regular candidate said paul 
green a political analyst at suburban governors state university 
sawyers strategists defended the commercials tuesday 
people have enjoyed the humor in the ads said horist the 
humor however is designed to draw attention to the point that 
daley is a trained candidate that he is being handled 
halperin said the the 44yearold daley who is white was 
confident but not complacent because of his frontrunner status 
recent polls have shown daley with a commanding lead support for 
the countys top prosecutor has been hovering at about 50 percent 
against about 30 percent for sawyer 10 percent for bloom and 10 
percent undecided the winner of the primary will face independent 
candidate alderman timothy evans and the republican candidate chosen 
in the gop primary in an april 4 special election to serve the 
twoyear balance of the late mayor harold washingtons unfinished 
term washington died of a heart attack in november 1987

an accused international terrorist convicted 
of transporting bombs through new jersey was sentenced tuesday to 30 
years in prison after renouncing the united states for the state 
terrorism of trying him and bombing libya in 1986 
us district judge alfred j lechner jr told prosecutors he 
believed their claims that yu kikumura 36 was a member of the 
terrorist group the japanese red army and that he plotted to kill 
us citizens to retaliate for the libyan bombing 
there is no other conclusion that can be drawn but that you 
are an international terrorist lechner said there is only one 
conclusion to draw from the design and construction of the bombs 
they were intended and designed for flesh and blood not for bricks 
and mortar 
kikumura told the judge before sentencing that the case against 
him was a ploy by the us government to justify the bombing of 
libya 
i denounce the government of the us for the legal handling of 
my case and for using this case to justify the attacks on the 
country and people of libya said kikumura in heavily accented 
english 
i am not linked to libya i do not have the background claimed 
by the united states he added 
kikumura said the attacks against libya violated international 
law 
so i denounce these immorals acts of state terrorism he said 
dressed in an olive shirt and tan pants kikumura stroked his 
chestlength black beard smiled and chuckled through much of the 
sixhour hearing he repeatedly left his seat to examine government 
evidence against him 
us attorney samuel alito said kikumura planned to use the bombs 
to destroy a military recruitment office in the veterans 
administration building in lower manhattan 
hes a terrorist and he has been a terrorist said alito 
arguing that kikumuras attorney offered no other reason why 
kikumura had the three bombs 
attorney william kunstler argued that prosecutors offered no firm 
evidence that his client kikumura planned to use the bombs 
investigators testified that they used hotel and store receipts 
to track kikumuras travels through new york new jersey 
pennsylvania ohio michigan illinois missouri tennessee 
kentucky and west virginia as he picked up bomb parts before his 
april 12 arrest on the new jersey turnpike 
alito argued for the maximum 100 years in prison for the 
explosives and firearms charges defense attorneys argued for 27 to 
33 months imprisonment 
alito said outside the courtroom that he was pleased with the 
judges sentence 
the sentence was based on what he did and what he intended to 
do he said that was to set off those bombs and kill people 
kunstler and an associate ronald kuby said they would appeal 
the case on grounds that include whether the search of kikumuras 
car was constitutional 
state trooper joseph fuentes testified at the sentencing hearing 
that witnesses told investigators they saw kikumura at the 
recruitment center in the veterans administration building in lower 
manhattan fuentes also said the building was marked by felttip pen 
on a map found inside kikumuras car when he was arrested 
also circled on the map were columbia university new york 
university and a lowermanhattan state university campus fuentes 
said 
kunstler objected to fuentes testimony saying he should have 
the right to question any eyewitnesses but lechner said such 
testimony was admissible at a sentencing hearing 
fbi agent thomas thurman who testified as an expert in 
explosives said the bombs were capable of causing many deaths and 
extensive damage 
there would be mass casualties and destruction to the point of 
the doors being blown out chairs and tables in the room would be 
picked up and shattered he said 
courtroom security was heavy for all of kikumuras court 
appearances us marshals toted rifles and shotguns and extra metal 
detectors were set up 
authorities also closed a westbound lane of the holland tunnel 
between new york and new jersey for 15 minutes as kikumura was 
brought to and from a new york city jail 
prosecutors said kikumura is a member of the terrorist group 
known as the japanese red army which may want him killed 
alito said kikumura planned to carry out the bombing in 
conjunction with the april 14 1988 attack on a uso club in naples 
italy that killed five people including a us 
servicewomankikumura was arrested two days before the naples blast 
which was on the second anniversary of the us air strike against 
libya

damaged the twostory exchange building a movie theater on the 
first floor and a hospital across the street 
the blast also smashed window panes in the area martinez said 
martinez said the explosion caused more than 25000 in damage

he said it will take about a week to restore service 
an anonymous telephone call to san pedro sulas radio norte a few 
hours later said the cinchonero popular liberation movement a 
small leftist terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack 
the group has claimed responsibility for kidnappings 
assassinations and bombings in honduras in the past eight years and 
such anonymous claims have usually turned out to be true 
cinchonero is spanish slang for a make of horse saddlebelts 
and the group takes its name from serapio romero a saddlebelt 
maker who led an abortive peasant revolution and was executed by 
firing squad in 1869 
the cinchoneros and other small leftist groups have been 
protesting the honduran governments policy of supporting the united 
state in trying to isolate the leftist sandinista government in 
neighboring nicaragua 
the ussupported contra rebels fighting the sandinistas for 
the past seven years are allowed by the military to keep supply and 
training bases inside honduras along the nicaraguan border 
as part of that police the united states maintains a permanent 
military presence in honduras and troops hold joint exercises 
regularly

financial planner henry gherman who fled to the far 
east last summer with nearly 10 million in investors money 
pleaded guilty tuesday to federal embezzlement and mail fraud 
charges 
under a plea bargain agreement negotiated by federal officials 
and ghermans attorney former us attorney general ramsey clark 
the defendant faces a possible maximum penalty of 35 years in prison 
gherman 52 also could be fined 175 million the question of 
restitution depends on bankruptcy court proceedings according to 
us attorney jeffrey crockett 
although gherman was arrested in tokyo in early october 1988 and 
was returned to miami late last december he had never been indicted 
by a federal grand jury when plea negotiations got under way 
the plea agreement was filed tuesday with the us attorneys 
office and is subject to approval by a federal judge who will hand 
down the actual sentence 
the court document charged that gherman willfully and 
unlawfully devised a scheme to defraud obtain money and property 
from clients of financial and investment planning inc in north 
miami beach 
at one point the document said gherman made false claims to 
solicit funds from clients most of them prominent southern florida 
physicians 
from december 1982 to august 1983 gherman embezzled 
approximately 98 million in funds entrusted to him according to 
the information of those funds about 75 million were from 
retirement plans he set up for clients the document said 
soon after fleeing the united states early last august he set up 
offshore bank accounts at the swissamerican national bank in 
antigua west indies to transfer and launder the embezzled money 
the document said 
but even as he entered the guilty plea gherman told us 
district judge stanley marcus i didnt solicit any money the 
money did go into financial and investment planning 
im guilty of all the charges but i was not hustling money i 
didnt go out and live it up 
gherman who had left behind photocopied notes apologizing to his 
clients was first located in taiwan and later arrested at a posh 
tokyo hotel 
with this guilty plea the ends of justice have been served 
said dexter lehtinen us attorney for the southern district of 
florida this is a very stiff possible sentence for whitecollar 
crime 
the judge set sentencing for april 26

exhaustion from the presidential campaign and

michael dukakis said in announcing that his courageous wife has 
begun treatment for alcohol abuse 
at a news conference monday dukakis said his wife who conquered 
a 26year addiction to diet pills had entered a private alcohol 
treatment center in newport ri 
he said his wifes underlying chemical dependency flared into 
bouts of excessive drinking after his loss to george bush in the 
november presidential election

kitty dukakis recent episodes of heavy drinking 
after overcoming a long dependence on diet pills is a sadly typical 
pattern of switching from one abused substance to another doctors 
say 
it is obviously the case especially nowadays that addiction 
or dependence on more than one substance is rather common said 
dr peter nathan director of the rutgers center of alcohol studies 
in piscataway nj 
for reasons that are not well understood people who have trouble 
with one moodaltering substance are especially susceptible to 
excessive use of others 
drug switching does occur and the drug thats easiest to 
switch into is alcohol said dr roger weiss of mclean hospital in

insurance companies developed the technique 
hundreds of years ago the larger the pool of those paying for 
insurance the lower the risk and the cost to any one of them 
and now it has been confirmed politically as it has been before 
by the bush administrations proposals for dealing with the problem 
of paying off the obligations of bankrupt savings and loan 
associations 
the reverse of the insurance concept is that whenever costs 
risks or obligations are confined to a few the pain is likely to be 
so great and the threat so imminent that whatever plan is offered 
will be deemed unacceptable 
when the pool is shallow there is no security those involved 
complain about the high risks and high costs and they demand that 
both be distributed more widely a bigger pool distributes all these 
the complaints too 
in the sampl case the idea of placing the cost directly on 
depositors at savings and loan and banking institutions was rejected 
before it was even formally proposed the pool was too small the 
pain too great 
under the formal plan described tuesday by president bush the 
government would add 50 billion in bonds to the 40 billion already 
earmarked by washington with interest costs shared by taxpayers and 
the savings industry 
banks and thrift institutions such as savings and loan 
associations and credit unions would be charged higher federal 
insurance premiums to help pay the bills insurance for depositors 
would not be raised at least directly 
in addition government would spend from budgeted funds some 50 
billion to finance a justice department program to monitor financial 
activities and prosecute illegalities eventually more funds could 
be needed for regulation 
in effect the pool was made so large that conceivably everyone 
will pay institutions depositors through lower earnings on 
savings and the general taxpaying public which finances 
government enterprises 
it would not set a precedent if in retrospect it was seen that 
the bulk of the proposals costs fell on the general public 
the reasoning for such speculation is that 
1 when conditions permit business tends to pass on rather than 
absorb additional costs tax business and the added expense filters 
down to the buyer of the product add expenses to lenders and it 
shows up in their rates 
2 any governmental expense eventually becomes a charge to the 
taxpayer it might be impossible to trace the route by which this 
occurs but sooner or later it shows up in such things as budget 
deficits and taxes 
perhaps hoping that the potential 100 billion cost of the rescue 
program might somehow be absorbed in the intricate filtering system 
bush nevertheless concedes there is no guarantee that costs wont be 
passed down 
more realistically he added at his news conference nothing is 
without pain when you come to solve a problem of this magnitude 
experience suggests he is right 
that experience shows the pain can be lessened for the few by 
spreading it among the many but that there is no machinery of 
government ingenuity of industry or wishful thinking of ordinary 
citizens that can make it disappear

the plaza hotel was in for a jolt when four 
mopheads from liverpool settled in a 12th floor suite for a short 
winters stay in february 1964 
they dove into room service jampb scotch with cocacola they 
binged on jam butties butter and jelly sandwiches corn flakes 
and ice cream and left bowls full of stubbed out ciggies the 
first morning 37 sacks of mail arrived and girls 
lots of girls 
screaming screeching silly schoolchildren who would kill their 
grandmothers for a glimpse of john paul george and ringo 
the lasses dressed as chambermaids and tried to sneak into the 
suite they posed as record company representatives anything they 
stormed the hotels revolving doors only to be dumped 
unceremoniously on the street with legions of their shrieking 
sisters 
it was the first magical mystery tour for the beatles they 
landed at kennedy airport on feb 7 to make their legendary first 
appearance on the ed sullivan show on feb 9 
for 15 days the country became inflamed with beatlemania and it 
would be years before the fever would die down 
they were cocky and sure at their news conferences at one john 
lennon was asked how much money he expected to earn during the tour 
his response about half a crown depends on the tax how much 
have you got and to what did they owe their success good press 
agent john replied 
ringo starr was asked what he thought of beethoven his reply 
great specially his poems 
it was a lark 
no one at that moment realized the rich gift and legacy to emerge 
from the four musicians they went on to sell more than any group in 
pop history indeed after their appearance on the ed sullivan 
show the beatles sold 25 million records in the united states in 
less than a month 
lennon is dead now shot outside his manhattan apartment building 
on dec 8 1980 
george harrison lives with his second wife olivia and 
9yearold son dhani in a fortresslike gothic mansion with spires 
and turrets at henleyonthames in western england he has lived out 
of the limelight for nearly 20 years but reemerged somewhat in 1987 
to give his first full concert in 15 years in july at wembley arena 
and to record a hit single got my mind set on you which topped 
the us cash box music chart in january 1988 
he also has recorded with bob dylan roy orbison and tom petty in

too many commitments to consider the 25th anniversary his spokesman 
bernard doherty said there have been a number of anniversaries in 
recent years there will be lots of anniversaries coming up hes 
still very busy making music 
mccartney said in a live radio phonein on the bbcs russian 
service last month that the beatles will never be revived because 
to find a replacement for john is impossible 
mccartney has four children his family lives on a fortified 
forest estate in sussex in southeast england 
but in 1964 the beatles had scarcely begun although wildly 
popular on the continent the fabulous four and their records did 
not catch on in the united states until jan 17 when i want to 
hold your hand hit no 1 on the cashbox chart 
within a year they grossed 16 million in the first weeks 
showing of their movie a hards day night and lennons kooky 
book in his own write climbed best seller lists overnight in 
rapid succession they made six hit albums including 1967s anthem 
to the summer of love sgt peppers lonely hearts club band 
sgt pepper sold 25 million records in its first three 
months and stayed on the charts for a staggering 113 weeks capitol 
records estimates the albums worldwide sales at 15 million since 
1967 
this alternately melancholy terrifying and exhilarating record 
captured as no other the complex textures of its time a 
supercharged corrosively contradictory summer when hippies grooved 
at the monterey pop festival black emotions exploded in riots in 
detroit and newark and a war grew bloodier in vietnam youthful 
listeners somehow heard all of this in sgt pepper an album 
whose themes included eastern culture sweet and terrifying 
psychedelic fantasies the widening gulf between young and old and 
above all loneliness 
to me the beatles created an excitement about being in the 
business itself says songwriter and performer christopher cross 
they stick out to me as the greatest thing in pop music paul 
mccartney has always been and remains my biggest influence of all 
time because of song structure he and john taught me how to write 
songs 
cross who won four grammy awards in 1981 for his song and lp

in the control tower at robins air force base 
master sgt george green asks a key question when the pilot of any 
fighter attack or bomber aircraft seeks permission for an 
unscheduled landing at the airfield in central georgia 
are you carrying external electroexplosive devices 
if the answer is yes chief controller green picks up a direct 
line to the operator of the pave paws radar installation two miles 
south of the airfield 
the radar operator flips a switch and for several minutes until 
the plane lands safely onehalf of the 90 million radar built to 
provide instantaneous warning of any submarinelaunched missile off 
the southeastern united states is shut down 
since november 1987 the air force now acknowledges the north 
face of pave paws at robins has been turned off an average of 14 
times a month for a total down time of about an hour a month to 
allow planes carrying externally mounted eeds to land 
the interruptions in the operation of the hightech strategic 
defense system are intended to avoid accidental detonations of the 
eeds tiny explosive charges that are found in virtually every 
military weapons system and in the planes and ships that deliver 
them 
eeds are used among other things to trigger weapons drop 
bombs or jettison fuel tanks they normally are detonated by an 
electrical circuit but they also can be set off by high levels of 
electromagnetic energy from such environmental sources as radio 
waves radar emissions static electricity and lightning 
the air force insists that the periodic interruptions of the 
robins pave paws have not hindered the effectiveness of the nations 
early warning system because the shutdowns are random and other 
radars are available as backups routine maintenance the air force 
says shuts the radar down for about 40 hours a month 
our primary concern at robins with pave paws is safety of 
flight said lt col john harmon commander of the base 
communications squadron we want to make sure that we have 
procedures in effect so there is no possibility of any plane having 
externally mounted eeds flying in a dangerous situation 
pave paws stands for precision acquisition vehicle entry phased 
array warning system the 10story pyramid shaped installation at 
robins one of four pave paws facilities nationwide consists of 
thousands of computerdirected antennas that can scan 240 degrees 
for 3000 miles the radar reportedly can identify an object the 
size of a basketball 1500 miles away 
the radar near robins is the only one located near an active 
runway there have been no problems reported near the others 
pave paws had been in operation for a year at robins before top 
air force officials became convinced that its powerful 
electromagnetic emissions might endanger their aircraft 
they then instituted the periodic shutdown procedures and 
established a restricted zone around the radar of one nautical mile 
about 6000 feet for all aircraft flying at or below 6400 feet 
the air force contends it has taken a conservative safety 
conscious approach at robins but critics such as patricia axelrod 
coordinator of the hero project charge that the location of the 
radar near a runway and a base where ordnance is handled is a 
disaster waiting to happen the air base georgias largest is 
located near the community of warnerrobins population 40000 
the hero project which derives its name from the navy acronym 
hazard of electromagnetic radiation to ordnance is part of a 
coalition that has filed suit in federal court in washington 
alleging that the military has not shielded its weaponry 
sufficiently to prevent accidents 
axelrod and the defense specialists who are assisting her in the 
lawsuit contend that the 6000foot hazard zone around pave paws is 
not sufficient she cited navy documents recommending that the ea6 
prowler airplane laden with electronicwarfare equipment far less 
powerful than pave paws be kept at least 8000 feet away from areas 
where ordnance is handled 
axelrod also argues that the flight restrictions at robins force 
pilots into a trapeze act without a net because of the 
possibility of human error in the chain of communication required to 
shut down the radar when an atrisk plane is landing 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee also has criticized the restrictions because of their 
reliance on the potentially fallible human links between the 
pilot control tower and pave paws radar operators 
nunn has asked the air force for an official evaluation of the 
potential hazards of the radar emissions to aircraft flight safety 
at robins and the longterm adequacy of the current procedures for 
minimizing that hazard 
lt gen donald j kutyna who heads the air force space command 
that has jurisdiction over pave paws acknowledged in a recent 
interview that he would rather have the radar someplace else 
based on what i know today the radar may not hurt anything 
but there is some concern otherwise there wouldnt be any flight 
restrictions he said if i had the choice all things being 
equal i would put the radar where i would not have to impose any 
safety zone 
the air force said the initial environmental assessment for pave 
paws concluded that the restricted zone needed around the radar 
would not interfere with the flight paths of any aircraft using the 
robins runway 
that conclusion was changed in 1987 when new calculations were 
done while the air force was developing plans to triple the power of 
pave paws to enhance its other mission tracking satellites in 
space the new calculations indicated that a larger restricted zone 
was needed 
the key difference in the new calculation was the way the radars 
power was determined the first assessment used the average power of 
the radar pulses over time while the later one used the peak power 
of each pulse 
air force officials acknowledge that the contractor who did the 
initial assessment recommended using peak power to calculate the 
restricted zone the recommendation was rejected because air force 
experts at the time did not believe brief exposure of and eed to the 
radar pulses would constitute a hazard 
we were on the cutting edge of technology with pave paws at the 
time we made that initial environmental assessment kutyna said 
to have learned something new since that time does not say that 
you were making a mistake before 
the air force already has spent 600000 on a study of the 
problem by the raytheon corp which built the radar system the 
study recommended moving the installation at a cost of 377 
million or modifying it at a cost of 27 million so it would shut 
down automatically if a plane breached the restricted zone 
kutyna said moving the radar is not a viable option but the 
modification proposal remains under consideration he said a panel 
of senior air force officers has been convened to make 
recommendations by june on a permanent solution that will end the 
flight restrictions 
in the meantime the air force has shelved plans to triple the 
radars power so it could take over the space tracking functions of 
the outdated radar system at eglin air force base in florida at an 
annual savings of 11 million 
unless there is a solution in the books that comes out of this 
study i would say the chances of putting that upgrade on there at 
this time are not high kutyna said

ivan the soviet unions gi joe is marching home 
from afghanistan after 9 years and 1 months of combat as many as 
15000 of his comrades died in the war he fought there against 
moslem guerrillas 35000 others were wounded 
dispatched to afghanistan in december 1979 ostensibly at the 
request of the promoscow government ivan leaves now with the 
stability of the marxist regime apparently as menaced as ever and 
his government learned the lesson that vietnam taught the united 
states 15 years ago even a superpower cant win someone elses war 
as a convoy of more than 100 soviet tanks and trucks set out for 
the border feb 9 president najib of afghanistan assured reporters 
that state power is in full control of the situation but as he 
spoke to reporters in kabul his capial explosions and artillery 
fire echoed throughout the city 
some 120000 strong the soviets battled the afghan resistance 
for more than twice as long as it took their fathers to drive nazi 
invaders back from stalingrad leningrad and moscow and all the way 
to berlin in world war ii 
but as the red army pulled out of afghanistan the mujahedeen 
rebels were able to block regular shipments of flour and kerosene 
even to the 2 million inhabitants of kabul other cities including 
gardez and khost were also besieged the soviets reported 
like vietnam for the americans afghanistan confounded the 
kremlins best and brightest their cause they said was building 
socialism in a poor mountainous land that even afghan marxists say 
is 99 percent moslem and where every invader through history has 
met ferocious resistance 
we obviously overestimated our possibilities and underestimated 
what one might call the resistance of the medium said one 
soviet commentator alexander bovin and in afghanistan we paid 
the highest price of all the price of blood 
an incorrect prediction was made author alexander prokhanov 
wrote last year experts were wrong in their assessment of the 
situation in the country mistakes were made by specialists in 
islam diplomats politicians the military because i repeat the 
main aims were not achieved 
leonid i brezhnev the the soviet president said he ordered 
tanks and troops to cross the 1300mile border with the soviet 
unions texassize neighbor dec 2427 1979 to counter what he 
described as western efforts to create a foyer of islamic 
fundamentalism at the soviet doorstep 
for the kremlin to have done nothing brezhnev said soon after 
the intervention would have been to watch passively the formation 
on our southern border of a serious danger to the security of the 
soviet state 
the decision to intervene was opposed by some in moscow 
oleg bogomolov now an economic adviser to president mikhail s 
gorbachev disclosed last year that the think tank he heads the 
institute of economics of the world socialist system sent a message 
to the kremlin within weeks of the intervention opposing it as 
futile and damaging 
the memo bogomolov recalled said the invasion blocked detente 
with the united states eliminated chances for limiting the arms 
race and sapped kremlin influence in moslem countries and the third 
world 
indeed the western world reacted with outrage and the shock 
waves rippled far from afghanistan prompting the united states to 
suspend grain sales and the export of hightechnology electronic 
gear coveted by a soviet society left far behind by the information 
explosion sixtyfour nations joined a boycott of the 1980 summer 
olympics in moscow and the kremlin stung by criticism of its 
actions banished human rights activist andrei d sahkarov to 
internal exile after he protested the invasion 
president jimmy carter called the soviet drive into afghanistan 
the most serious threat to peace since the second world war 
because it brought the other superpower within easy striking 
distance of the oilrich persian gulf which carter proclaimed vital 
to us security 
even top members of the kremlin hierarchy were caught by surprise 
there are even candidate members of the politburo who learned 
that troops had entered afghanistan only after reading the 
newspapers editor grigory baklanov said in a speech last year 
what may have beguiled the soviets was the apparent similarity of 
afghanistan to their own heavily moslem central asian republics 
where bolshevik rule was imposed in the 1920s by communist 
commissars leading red army troops against local tribal bands 
portrayed by the soviet press as liberators red army troops went 
to help their afghan comrades build a marxistleninist society or 
so the official thinking went 
but in afghanistan prokhanov said sobering events dispelled 
many illusions crowds of many thousands carrying the green 
moslem banner and shouting allah akhbar stormed the party 
district committees 
he blamed najibs party the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan both for doctrinaire measures the persecution of 
mullahs and the flouting of customs and for abandoning the goals 
of the countrys 1978 marxist revolution 
since those december days when the ussrs troops went into 
afghanistan the kabul governments political course has changed 
many times prokhanov said the original aims proclaimed by the 
pdpa were not achieved they have been renounced by the party 
itself and that being so the presence of soviet troops in the 
country loses its meaning departure is inevitable logical 
in a 1986 speech gorbachev placed the blame for the continuing 
strife in afghanistan on the west but he voiced the soviets 
growing desire to get out 
counterrevolution and imperialism he said have turned 
afghanistan into a bleeding wound 
although the horrors of the afghan war unlike vietnam were 
never brought regularly into soviets living rooms on television 
the loosened restraints on expression inspired by gorbachevs drive 
for glasnost or openness increasingly emboldened soviets to 
voice objections to the war 
a documentary film titled the return which made its way into 
theaters last year showed wounded soviet soldiers and blownup 
tanks for the first time it also showed troubled veterans and a 
bereaved mother 
im a terrible enemy of this war said a tearful klavdia 
ilyin with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in the 
background i dont see why our children are there 
in february 1988 gorbachev said the soviets were pulling out 
whether or not najibs efforts at national reconciliation were 
successful in effect the soviets abandoned any claim they had on 
safeguarding the gains of socialism in afghanistan 
like the british cavalry whose noble but futile charge in the 
crimean war is honored in tennysons poem the charge of the light 
brigade ivan the soldier is now praised for his valor in a noble 
cause but not for victory 
planes carrying soldiers are flying out of afghanistan 
pravda wrote the other day military columns are starting out on 
the road or are just about to for home for the motherland 
soldiers are coming back from the war having done their duty 
despite such ritualist talk of duty a stanza from a song of 
soviet soldiers in afghanistan shows the bewilderment and futility 
many felt 
they fight for the prophet mohammed 
while we defend only our soviet truck

the soviet withdrawal from afghanistan 
leaves the rugged south asian country physically and economically 
ravaged its political future uncertain and large numbers of its 
people scattered in safer havens 
more than a third of the countrys 15 million pathans tajiks and 
people of other tribes have fled to pakistan and iran as fighting 
continues between forces of the communist government and moslem 
guerrillas 
much of the countrys agriculturalbased economy is in ruins its 
roads are lined with wrecked implements of war its lunar landscape 
remains littered with mines 
the ruling peoples democratic party of afghanistan which seized 
power in a 1978 military coup still sits in kabul but its mainly 
conscripted army has only tenuous control of the cities 
the mujahedeen islamic holy warriors claim to hold 90 
percent of the countryside 
their stated goal is to rout the communists and establish an 
islamic republic of afghanistan but their myriad factions have 
failed repeated attempts to forge a united political front 
it shows the futility of military solutions said soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze on a recent visit to pakistan 
which in addition to the united states has backed the guerrillas 
for a decade 
in human terms the cost is estimated at more than 1 million 
afghan and 15000 soviet war dead 
it was the marxist coup which set off the civil war soviet 
troops and armor intervened in december 1979 to replace one 
promoscow government with another but the moslem insurgency only 
intensified 
afghanistans president najib who uses only one name and has 
shortened it from najibullah insists that his forces can hold 
kabul the capital without the red armys help 
however the mujahedeen claim his army is demoralized and that 
several of its leaders are bargaining to surrender 
even najibs own party is divided from within between his urban 
parcham banner wing and the khalq masses faction which 
predominates the military 
western diplomats speculate that a great deal of terrorist 
bombings and gunfire in kabul are related to this factionalism and 
not to the war with mujahedeen 
united nations officials say afghanistan will need massive 
reconstruction once the fighting stops no one has been able to 
predict when 
many of the countrys once thriving orchards cottonfields and 
vinyards have been destroyed by sovietafghan carpet bombing or have 
grown wild for lack of care according to un estimates 
its mineral mining industry is damaged or lies idle for lack of 
trained workers most of them either are fighting the war living as 
refugees or are dead 
the united nations is planning a 11 billion relief and 
recontruction project named operation salaam which means peace 
in arabic officials say they cant begin the gargantuan task until 
fighting in afghanistan stops 
this is a very crucial time and we have to give peace a 
chance said prince sadruddin agha khan the un special 
coordinator of the project who has been shuttling between 
islamabad kabul and moscow to oversee the logistics 
the organizations high commissionerate for refugees has 
predicted that the repatriation of more than 3 million afghan 
refugees from pakistan and 2 million from iran will be the biggest 
human transmigration in un history 
even if peace lures the refugees home millions of landmines and 
smaller explosive booby traps await them 
teams from the united states france and turkey already have 
begun visiting refugee camps along pakistans frontier to teach the 
afghans how to identify the devices and defuse them 
exacerbating the afghans suffering has been one of the worst 
winters in recent memory snow and mujahedeen attacks on supply 
convoys have left kabul and other afghan cities desparately short of 
food and fuel 
the first stage of operation salaam is an airlift of food 
blankets and medicines 
mujahedeen factions though organized in the field have failed 
to unite in a political front that can form an alternative to the 
kabul government 
the seven most powerful groups are sunni moslems and comprise the 
loose sevenparty islamic unity of afghan mujahedeen headquartered 
in peshawar pakistan 
at least eight other smaller groups are shiite moslems and 
operate from iran 
the two sides frequently have traded gunfire during the war as 
have the component parties of the two alliances all profess a 
desire to form an islamic government but personal rivalries among 
the rebel leaders appear to be the biggest obstacle 
it reflects afghanistans history as a feudal society ruled by 
tribal leaders and local warlords who for centuries spurned the 
notion of centralized government 
this entire war has been one of partiality that has not 
changed said hamed karzai a spokesman of the pakistanbased 
rebel alliance we are moslems but very peculiar moslems 
the war nudged pakistan closer to washington as the pipeline for 
us arms to the mujahedeen it helped distract the 
democratcontrolled congress in washington from the issue of 
pakistans nuclear program which some suspect is developing or has 
developed nuclear weapons and over to generous military and 
economic aid treaties with islamabad 
lets face it pakistan has become a good friend in a part of 
the world where we dont have many said us ambassador arnold 
raphel before he wa killed last year 
raphel was returning to islamabad with president mohammad zia 
ulhaq and most of his top generals from a demonstration of the us 
m1 abrams tank in august when their pakistani air force plane 
crashed killing all 30 people aboard 
investigators said the wreckage indicated sabotage pakistani 
officials privately said the top suspects were moscow and kabul in 
an alleged plot to eliminate the mujahedeens staunchest patron 
pakistanis claim the war has cost them hundreds of lives of their 
own in terrorist bombings a glut of firearms and a burgeoning 
heroin trade 
weapons earmarked for the rebels frequently have wound up with 
the drug barons of pakistans north west frontier 
pakistani narcotics officials claim the fighting in afghanistan 
has diverted much of its opium and heroin production to pakistan 
the drugs find their way to europe and north america via the 
arabian sea port of karachi the agents say

the defense in the first wall street fraud case 
to go to trial is suggesting that disgraced broker and star 
prosecution witness boyd l jefferies may have obstructed justice 
with the governments knowledge 
defense attorney arthur liman asserted in the gaf corp stock 
manipulation case monday that jefferies threw out notes about his 
dealings in violation of a subpoena and shortly after reaching a 
plea agreement with the government 
liman implied before a federal jury that jefferies intentionally 
disposed of daily notes he wrote on yellow legal pads 
nervous under crossexamination jefferies said he had informed 
prosecutors he was going to clear out his office 
no one said you had to preserve the yellow pads liman asked 
not that i recall the witness said 
jefferies 58 also testified anew that gaf in october 1986 asked 
him and his los angelesbased securities firm to manipulate the 
stock price of union carbide corp and agreed to pay 40000 to 
cover losses in the deal 
the case in federal court in manhattan has been viewed as a key 
test of the governments ability to obtain criminal convictions from 
a spinoff of the ivan boesky insider trading scandal 
us district judge mary johnson lowe last month declared a 
mistrial in the case after concluding that prosecutors withheld a 
key piece of evidence from the defense 
gaf a manufacturer of specialty chemicals and building 
materials and its vice chairman james t sherwin were indicted 
last july for allegedly trying to inflate the price of union carbide 
stock 
the purpose of the alleged manipulation was to maximize gafs 
gain from the sale of its holding in carbide after a failed attempt 
to take over the much larger chemical company 
appearing confident under questioning from assistant us 
attorney carl loewenson jr jefferies said he bought shares of 
union carbide in late october 1986 at sherwins request to boost the 
price to 22 a share sherwin guaranteed to cover any losses 
sustained by jefferies amp co 
mr sherwin said if we wanted union carbide to close at a 
specific price or higher for a few days do you think you will be 
able to do that i said yes jefferies testified 
jeffries offered similar testimony at the original trial 
under crossexamination jefferies testified that on march 30 
1987 he emptied his office of notes on his daily activities after 
october 1986 liman seized on the matter to point out that jefferies 
earlier that month had agreed to cooperate with the government 
liman said jefferies subpoena from the securities and exchange 
commission called for all notes relevant to his activities from 
january 1984 to the present 
are you saying that you dont recall whether you threw out 
notes that were under subpoena liman asked 
i know i did not throw out anything when i left the company on 
march 30 that pertained to any request from the government from the 
sec jefferies countered i have nothing to hide mr liman 
possibly seeking to question the governments relationship with 
jefferies liman said destroying subpoenaed notes would constitute 
obstruction of justice and said jefferies had not been granted 
immunity for destroying the notes 
jefferies struck a plea agreement with the government after he 
was implicated in the scandal with boesky the jailed speculator who 
agreed to turn states evidence in late 1986 
jefferies agreed to plead guilty in march 1987 two securities law 
violations to quit his brokerage and to stay out of the securities 
business for at least five years he awaits sentencing

the chairman of the opposition democratic socialist 
party plans to resign from his party office a party spokesman said 
tuesday he would be the latest politician to fall in a farreaching 
stockprofiteering scandal 
the resignation of saburo tsukamoto 61 had been expected for 
weeks after he confirmed in december he had profited from selling 
shares in a subsidiary of recruit co an informationbased 
conglomerate at the center of the scandal 
three members of prime minister noboru takeshitas cabinet quit 
because of the scandal a member of the japan socialist party 
resigned his parliament seat and more than a dozen other government 
officials business leaders and media executives quit their 
positions because of links to recruit 
since the scandal erupted last summer it has raised political 
ethics to the forefront of national debate although the share 
transactions were not illegal under securities law they had a taint 
of bribery and influencepeddling prosecutors have questioned 
recruit executives as well as government officials in a bribery 
probe 
yukio hayashi spokesman of the democratic socialists told the 
associated press that tsukamoto told party leaders tuesday morning 
he was resigning and he would meet with the partys central 
committee on tuesday afternoon to confirm his intention to quit 
press reports said tsukamoto told reporters at his home tuesday 
morning he would not run for a third twoyear term as chairman when 
the party holds its convention feb 22 
tsukamoto was not resigning his nineterm seat in the house of 
representatives where his moderate party with 29 of 512 seats is 
the third largest opposition bloc after the japan socialist party 
and komeito or the clean government party 
the democratic socialists had formed a tacit alliance last year 
with takeshitas liberal democratic party to give a semblance of 
unity when parliament passed the governments tax bill 
tsukamotos links to the recruit scandal then were seen as 
helping the governing liberal democrats push the tax bill through 
because the social democrats were as hobbled by the taint of scandal 
as the governing party and could not take any high moral position 
the opposition party leader earned about 77000 by selling 
shares in the recruit realestate subsidiary recruit cosmos which 
recruit offered him at a bargain price before the shares were listed 
for public trading in 1986 
cabinet members who have resigned are finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa justice minister takashi hasegawa and ken harada director 
general of the economic planning agency

interest rates including mortgage rates are 
headed higher as the federal reserve keeps trying to dampen 
inflationary pressure by slowing economic growth many economists 
predict 
this effort will put the central bank on a collision course with 
the new administration and make it more difficult for president bush 
to keep his campaign pledge to lower the budget deficit without 
resorting to new taxes analysts say 
fed policymakers were gathering today for two days of 
closeddoor meetings to set monetary growth targets for 1989 their 
actions will not be revealed until federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan testifies to congress on feb 21 
private economists are widely predicting that the fed will 
continue pushing interest rates higher because of fears that the 
economy is still growing too rapidly to keep inflation under control 
there is no question that there will be a tightening the 
question is how much said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co 
some economists would not rule out a onehalf percentage point 
increase in the feds discount rate which now stands 65 percent 
but other analysts argued that the fed would probably avoid such a 
dramatic change in favor of more subtle behindthescenes tightening 
moves the discount rate is the interest the fed charges to make 
loans to commercial banks 
since last march the fed has been draining bank reserves from 
the system thus making money more scarce and the cost of money 
interest rates higher 
analysts keep track of this process by watching the federal funds 
rate the interest banks charge to make loans to each other the 
federal funds rate now stands above 9 percent and analysts predict 
it is likely to rise by about onequarter percentage more in the 
coming two months 
this will likely force banks to boost their prime lending rate 
which now stands at 105 percent already its highest level since 
mid1985 economists say 
economists also say that home loans both adjustable and 
fixedrate mortgages are headed higher with some predicting that 
fixedrate mortgages will climb to around 11 percent currently 
fixedrate mortgages are averaging 106 percent according to a 
nationwide survey by the federal home loan mortgage corp up from 
99 percent a year ago 
bush has pledged to reduce this years expected 160 billion 
budget deficit by more than 60 billion in the fiscal year which 
begins next oct 1 but such a goal would be jeopardized by the 
feds inflationfighting efforts 
bushs budget which he will unveil on thursday will use the 
same optimistic assessment of the economy employed by thenpresident 
reagan in his final budget last month 
fed credittightening already has pushed shortterm interest 
rates a full 2 percentage points higher than the administrations 
estimate of 63 percent for 1989 and fed officials are working to 
slow economic growth to between 2 percent and 25 percent 
significantly below the 32 percent forecast by the administration 
both of these discrepancies are significant because they spell 
lower government revenues higher interest payments to finance the 
27 trillion national debt and a larger budget deficit 
everybody knows the administrations economic forecast cant 
work said michael evans head of a washington forecasting firm 
greenspan is running the economy and bush isnt 
the administration has been trying to convince the fed that its 
worries about inflation are overblown bush himself said last week 
that greenspan was more concerned about inflation than i am right 
now 
but the fed will likely withstand the political pressure for a 
looser monetary policy analysts said especially in view of 
business statistics showing an economy with tight labor markets and 
industries operating at peak capacity 
fed officials hope to slow the economy enough to ward off another 
inflationary spiral without dampening demand so much that it risks a 
recession 
roger brinner senior economist at data resources inc said he 
believed the fed would be able to achieve this soft landing 
i dont think there will be a recession through 1990 because 
the fed acted early to fight inflation and continues to avoid any 
panic moves which would mean very large and sudden increases in 
interest rates brinner said 
the fed policymaking group is known as the federal open market 
committee made up of the seven members of the federal reserve board 
in washington and five of the 12 presidents of fed district banks

future industry analysts say 
the order also is indicative of an airline that picks its 
equipment in a smart precise way says a spokesman an aircraft 
maker that lost out on the deal 
fort worth texasbased american scheduled a news conference for 
today to disclose details of its purchase which some industry 
experts believe could total 7 billion the airline is expected to 
order 50 to 60 md11 jumbo jets and as many as 100 smaller md80 
twinjets from mcdonnell douglas corp 
the purchase would be the first huge aircraft order in 1989 
after a year that saw at least nine carriers including american 
place jet orders for 1 billion or more 
they included a 504 billion order in may by international lease 
finance corp for 130 planes from boeing co and airbus industrie 
and a september orderandoption package by delta air lines for 215 
planes split between boeing and mcdonnell douglas that could be 
worth 6 billion to 10 billion 
the big three commercial jet builders shattered order records in 
1988 boeing with about twothirds of the market announced firm 
orders for 636 planes worth 301 billion surpassing 1987 orders by 
49 percent mcdonnell douglas had orders for 246 planes and airbus 
the european consortium 167 but neither announced dollar values 
few believe 1989 will approach those marks but boeing estimates 
theres plenty of room in the new plane market more than 450 
billion worth in 1989 dollars between now and 2005 
demand for new planes is so great that its tough for operators 
to get them when they want them 
in general the industry is running flatout at capacity and is 
pretty much booked into the 199293 time frame wolfgang demisch 
aerospace industry analyst for union bank of switzerland in new 
york said monday being able to provide delivery spots seems at 
least one factor in american deciding for the md11 besides what 
may be a very advantageous price 
md11s normally sell for 90 million to 100 million but 
analysts said americans actual purchase price could be for 80 
million to 85 million each partly because of the large number 
ordered 
american already has 118 md80s and 60 dc10s a predecessor to 
the md11 along with a wide variety of boeing jets 
the md11 is a threeengine widebody capable of carrying 405 
passengers 8000 miles mcdonnell douglas bills it as a longhaul 
jet to serve routes that dont have the passenger volume to justify 
a boeing 747 boeings new 747400 also can fly 8000 miles 
carrying about 479 passengers 
boeing was at a disadvantage said analyst william whitlow jr at 
dain bosworth co in seattle since american flies such routes as 
dallastokyo with fewer passengers than say tokyolos angeles 
it just looks to me that they probably werent in the hunt 
based on what they are able to provide whitlow said the 747 is 
so much bigger 
boeing is considering a smaller longhaul plane a new version of 
its 767 widebody but thats only in the talking stage airbus is 
taking orders for its fourengine a340 which will carry about 295 
passengers 7500 miles but airbus spokesman david venz in herndon 
va said it was effectively eliminated from the american bidding 
because the first a340 wont be available until 1992 
likewise venz said airbus would have loved to sell american a 
slew of its hotselling a320s a smaller plane that competes with 
the twinjet md80 and boeings 737 family but were essentially 
sold out on that airplane up to the 9293 period he said 
boeing spokesman david jimenez said monday there is a waiting 
period for new boeing jets negotiable with each order but 
usually a couple of years out he said he did not have 
particulars on the pending american order but said boeing had 
talked to american about buying planes 
don hanson mcdonnell douglas spokesman in long beach calif 
said his companys delivery dates generally extend into 1993 
however there are always ways to be able to swap delivery 
positions to satisfy a customer hanson said he declined to 
discuss the american order monday 
though american may favor mcdonnell douglas today it has spread 
its business in the past airbus is delivering 25 a300600r 
widebodies that american ordered in 1987 and american last year 
gave boeing a 2 billion order for 50 midsized 757s with options 
for 50 more 
venz said american officials like to get the precise plane for 
the job 
they buy in a very smart and sophisticated way they go out and 
look at the market and look at what airplanes are there to do 
specific jobs that can bring them great rewards he said 
analysts say the need to replace aging fleets has spurred the 
recent orders 
traumas involving older planes including the accident last 
spring in which the top came off an aloha airlines 737 over hawaii 
focused attention on the safety of older jets airplane makers 
regulators and operators say a jet is safe to fly indefinitely if 
properly maintained but note that maintenance costs climb with an 
aircrafts age 
also many older planes dont meet tougher noise regulations 
burn more fuel and require a crew of three instead of two the 
configuration of many newer jets

bankamerica corps decision to resume paying 
dividends to stockholders signals managements confidence that the 
company has bounced back from three years of losses the banks top 
executive said 
the holding company for bank of america the nations 
thirdlargest bank announced monday it would pay a dividend of 15 
cents per share of common stock the first such payment since the 
fourth quarter of 1985 preferred stock dividends also will resume 
the banks chief executive said 
by reinstating our cash dividend were marking a very important 
milestone in our financial recovery aw clausen the companys 
chairman and chief executive officer told reporters it assures 
our customers that bankamerica has put behind it a very difficult 
period in our history 
the san franciscobased bank has for several months been 
pronouncing itself cured of a variety of financial ills that brought 
three years of red ink starting in 1985 the problems are traced to 
losses on a variety of loans including third world debt and real 
estate and farm lending in this country 
bankamerica returned to the black last year posting a yearend 
profit of 726 million or 379 a share in contrast with a 955 
million loss the previous year the 1987 results were depressed by 
the addition of 11 billion to the banks loanloss reserve 
the common stock dividend is payable march 10 to stockholders of 
record feb 23 it was declared by the board of directors at a 
meeting here 
bankamericas last dividend was paid in the fourth quarter of 
1985 the dividend reached a high of 38 cents a quarter in 1984 and 
was reduced the following year 
bankamerica stock closed at 2050 a share in composite trading 
down 37 cents from fridays close 
analysts had expected a resumption of the dividend said dan 
williams who follows the company for sutro amp co in san francisco 
and stockholders could be expected to begin agitating for dividends 
given the banks recent strong performance 
the move signals management confidence he reasoned since 
executives would be unlikely to risk being forced to reduce or stop 
dividends once they are restarted 
clausen said the banks directors decided to pay the dividend 
because the institution had returned to profitability through its 
daily operations as opposed to profits sustained through the sale 
of assets 
in december 1986 the company sold its retail bank in italy for 
603 million in february of 1987 it agreed to sell the charles 
schwab discount brokerage company for 230 million the company also 
closed various branches and eliminated thousands of jobs over the 
past two years 
clausen said the banks base of assets has been rebuilt to the 
point that it exceeds federal regulators minimum requirement for 
riskbased capital for yearend 1992

analysts say a bidding contest for champion spark 
plug co may follow cooper industries 800 million cash buyout 
proposal which tops champions earlier agreement for a 590 million 
takeover by dana corp 
cooper a diversified maker of commercial and industrial 
products announced its 21 a share buyout proposal on monday and 
indicated it might be prepared to bid even higher 
champions board of directors met today in a previously scheduled 
session and company spokesman anthony mougey said the board agreed 
to consider the cooper offer 
no definitive action was taken by the board at a regularly 
scheduled meeting today beyond the decision to explore the cooper 
proposal he said 
coopers proposal sent champions stock up 325 to 2262 a 
share on the new york stock exchange monday on speculation that dana 
might have to raise its 1750 a share cashandstock buyout offer 
coopers offer still is subject to confirmation by the companys 
board of directors which next meets feb 21 
dana an automotive parts manufacturer based in toledo ohio 
signed an agreement last month under which it would pay 1750 in 
cash and securities for champions outstanding shares 
robert cizik chairman and president of cooper said monday he 
had no objection to champions agreement to pay dana 15 million if 
their buyout fell through 
cizik also said in a letter to champions board of directors that 
cooper would be prepared to increase the purchase price of our 
proposal if you and your advisers can demonstrate to us additional 
values inherent in champion spark plug co 
dana spokesman don decker said the company had no comment on 
coopers action and declined to say if dana would increase its bid 
 
champion is the worlds leading manufacturer of spark plugs for 
all types of internal combustion engines it also manufactures anco 
windshield wiper blades and a variety of other fuel system and 
automotive maintenance products it has annual revenue of about 720 
million and employs about 9200 people worldwide 
strategically this is a significant opportunity for cooper 
cizik said 
champion has strong brand recognition and market leadership and 
would provide an excellent entry into its two market segments he 
said 
under the dana agreement dana would pay 1750 cash per share up 
to half of champtions outstanding common shares with the rest 
being exchanged for dana stock with a value of 1750 a share 
wall street analysts have said danas attempt to buy champion may 
be hampered because champions stock remains above 1750 some 
analysts say dana is buying champion for a bargain price 
a member of champions founding family stephen stranahan 
recently quit the board because he was unhappy with the dana deal 
the stranahan family in 1986 established the chinook partners 
lp to maintain a dominant voice in champions affairs chinook 
controls 35 percent of champions common stock 
chinook has yet to tender its shares to dana which some wall 
street analysts have said would have locked up the deal 
houstonbased cooper with 1988 revenue of 43 billion is a 
diversified worldwide manufacturer of products for the electrical 
electronic commercial industrial compression and drilling market 
dana which had 1987 sales of 49 billion makes a variety of 
automotive parts including drivetrain components engine parts and

grain and soybean futures opened mostly lower 
today on the chicago board of trade then turned narrowly mixed with 
little fresh news to influence prices 
the slight early losses reflected some followthrough selling 
after mondays steep declines in the corn and soybean pits 
analysts said forecasts for more snow this week in the great 
plains and the midwest have put grain traders on the defensive 
the snow means more moisture in areas stricken by last summers 
drought 
there is a growing realization among traders that the odds of a 
backtoback crop adversity in midwest are extremely small said 
richard feltes director of commodities research with refco inc a 
chicagobased commodities brokerage firm 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 426 a bushel corn was 
cent to cent lower with march at 266 a bushel oats were 1

former federal reserve chairman paul volcker 
today gave a general endorsement to the bush administrations effort 
to rescue the savings and loan industry as members of congress said 
they intended to act on a bailout package as quickly as possible 
volcker testifying before the senate banking committee said 
that while he had not had a chance to review the bush proposal in 
detail he believed that it addressed all of the major problems 
facing the sampl industry 
i welcome the administrations initiative this early in the 
congressional session volcker said the presidents program 
provides a very good base for your consideration of legislation 
volcker said he was concerned that the deposit insurance premiums 
on savings and loans and the nations commercial 13000 banks not be 
raised so high that it put the institutions at a competitive 
disadvantage with other financial entities 
my sense is that the increased insurance premiums goes to the 
edge of viability in terms of not undermining the health of the 
financial industry which is under heavy competition he said 
volcker also said he disagreed with the administrations proposal 
to abolish the federal home loan bank board as an independent 
regulatory agency president bushs plan would retain only the 
chairman of the bank board making him the head of an sampl regulatory 
agency that would be placed under the jurisdiction of the treasury 
department 
volcker said that instead of abolishing the threemember bank 
board he would prefer leaving it as an independent regulatory agency 
but split off its oversight of the sampl deposit insurance fund 
committee chairman donald riegle dmich said he and sen jake 
garn of utah the panels ranking republican plan to introduce the 
administrations package as soon as it was submitted and schedule 
early hearings in an effort to vote the measure out in as short a 
time as possible 
i am determined to see us act quickly in the committee to match 
the speed of the administration riegle said at the beginning of 
the hearing both riegle and garn called on the other committee 
members to set aside partisan differences and work with dispatch to 
report a bill to the full senate 
this problem is serious enough that we dont have time to be 
partisan about it garn said i hope we can get together in the 
next few months to pass legislation 
volcker said the problem was of such a serious nature that if 
necessary congress should consider exempting the necessary 
government spending from the overall deficit limits established by 
the grammrudman balancedbudget law 
he said this could be justified because sale of the government 
bonds being used to finance the bailout effort was different from 
ordinary government expenditures and would not have the same 
inflationary impact on the economy as raising spending in such areas 
as defense 
on the question of raising the deposit insurance premiums 
volcker did not provide a specific amount that he would like to see 
but he said the bush recommendation came very close to the limits 
that the banks could bear 
the banks are having enough trouble competing now and i dont 
like to see any additional burdens put on them volcker said 
this goes toward the limits of what is tolerable

move by the illinois central transportation co that could raise the 
railroads price tag above the 436 million that prospect is 
offering 
illinois central said monday it was taking a neutral stance on

american airlines announced one of the biggest 
aircraft orders in history today calling for the carrier to acquire 
at least eight new longrange mcdonnell douglas corp jetliners with 
options to buy another 42 plus options for 100 smaller planes 
the order announced in new york by senior executives of both 
companies will make american the first us carrier to obtain 
delivery of the md11 a widebody longhaul plane designed to 
replace the older dc10 the smaller md80 would replace the boeing 
727 
neither company would place a value on the deal but it is 
potentially worth several billion dollars and marks a major coup for 
mcdonnell douglas which has been aggressively seeking orders for 
the md11 in the highstakes aircraft competition with boeing co 
and the airbus industrie consortium of europe 
the fort worth texasbased airlines aircraft acquisitions come 
amid rising concern about aging us commercial aircraft fleets and 
whether older planes are less safe 
the new aircraft will replace some older planes in americans 
fleet which is an average of 94 years old compared with 124 
industrywide 
the md11s have a list price of 100 million but analysts said 
americans actual purchase price will probably be in the range of 
80 million to 85 million per plane 
american has done quite a lot of expansion since deregulation 
entered the international service opened new hubs and has 
announced further intentions to expand further in the international 
service thats what the purchases are all about said lee howard 
executive vice president of airline economics inc in washington 
knowing how tough american is about demanding favorable terms 
on these purchases my guess is mcdonnell douglas must be giving 
them a good deal said andrew bs kim an analyst with robert 
fleming inc in new york 
they american officials are doing this to get a younger 
fleet said julius maldutis a salomon brothers inc analyst in 
new york what it does simply is to position american airlines for 
the rest of the decade the 1990s and gives them enormous 
flexibility because of the maintenance problems everyone else is 
having with their older fleets 
but robert j joedicke an advisory director for shearson lehman 
hutton inc in new york downplayed airline safety as an issue 
behind the purchase 
i recognize the public perception but aircraft do not wear out 
as long as they are properly maintained he said it does cost 
too much money to maintain the older planes but an aircraft does 
not become unsafe american will be looking at lower unit costs and 
aircraft more dedicated to the operations they have with the new 
planes 
american is doing a lot more overseas operations joedicke 
continued the md11 is better suited to the routes that american 
does fly overseas based on the density of the routes 
kim said the md11s are longhaul aircraft that will replace 
americans dc10 fleet the dc10 was the predecessor of the md11 
he said the md80s are shorthaul twinjets that will help replace 
americans boeing 727s which comprise the largest percentage of 
americans 470jet fleet

president bush will propose freezing defense 
spending at the level of inflation in his thursday budget message to 
congress to help pay for expanded domestic programs administration 
sources said today 
bush meanwhile proclaimed his document pretty well 
finalized and headed for capitol hill for a series of meetings 
with congressional leaders 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater said bush would go 
over his budget in general terms with lawmakers of both parties 
the president will assure them that he has tried to make a 
workmanlike effort to produce a budget that is the beginning of 
negotiations fitzater said 
the spokesman called the budget a starting point and said 
bush wants to work with congress on a bipartisan basis in coming 
up with a budget consensus 
earlier bush declared most of the work finished during a 
picturetaking session as he met with his budget director richard 
darman vice president dan quayle and others to put the finishing 
touches on the spending plan 
asked by reporters whether he had found enough in his budget to 
pay for his kinder gentler nation campaign promises bush said 
only stay tuned 
the president will prepare his proposed revision of president 
reagans 115 trillion budget plan for fiscal 1990 in a speech to a 
joint session of congress on thursday evening 
bush decided on the defense freeze in budget sessions over the 
weekend said officials who declined to be identified by name 
reagan had proposed raising defense spending authority by 2 
percent above the rate of inflation to 3152 billion for the 
fiscal year that begins next oct 1 thats up from 2988 billion 
in the current fiscal year 
however in terms of actual outlays cash to be spent in fiscal 
1990 bushs decision to freeze defense spending at the inflation 
level would free up about 2 billion 
thats only about a third of what some analysts say bushs 
combined campaign pledges would cost 
although the presidents budget was expected to ask for increases 
in defense spending in later years the freeze for fiscal 1990 is in 
keeping with his call for a flexible freeze 
according to officials familiar with the budget bushs plan 
calls for increases over the reagan levels in dozens of categories 
with the largest increases coming in the areas of education and 
cleaning up the environment 
the budget will reflect virtually all of bushs major campaign 
promises although in some cases such as his proposal for a 500 
million national merit school program the items will be scaled 
back the officials said 
still the reagan budget will be the core of the bush budget 
said one official 
rather than doing a complete rewrite of the reagan budget as 
reagan did of former president carters lameduck 1981 budget 
bushs plan will be more in the form of amendments to reagans plan 
officials said

airlines find lost baggage in addition reporting methods vary for

for those who hope to avoid living in donald 
trumps buildings flying in donald trumps airplanes gambling in 
donald trumps casinos and reading donald trumps book there is a 
new hazard 
playing donald trumps game 
the ubiquitous mogul appeared with representatives of milton 
bradley co on tuesday at a trump tower news conference in midtown 
manhatta to announce that trump the game would appear on 
toystore shelves this spring 
i think that you can really learn a lot about yourself in a 
business sense by playing the game trump said 
trump is somewhat like monopoly in that the player with the 
most money wins but the trump t has replaced monopoly game 
pieces like the shoe the thimble and the iron and the highest 
trump denomination is 100 million instead of 500 
nor does monopoly feature pictures of donald trump on the money 
the game board the playing cards and the box trump the game does 
its a much more sophisticated game than monopoly trump 
said i like to play monopoly ive played it all my life in 
many forms 
capitalists aged 12 and older are invited to share in the 
exciting highstakes risktaking i get to do every day if you 
are clever aggressive and cut the best deals you can earn millions 
even billions of dollars just remember play to win or not 
at all 
this enterprise will not line trumps pockets his proceeds from 
the 25 game will go to causes like cerebral palsy aids and the 
homeless he said 
the developer appears in a commercial for the game in it 
financiers and average new yorkers ponder whats trumps game 
and trump himself is chased by inquiring reporters his game he 
says is trump the game 
i think youll like it trump says at the commercials close 
trump insists that he likes the game which he expects will 
become a toy standard he has played it himself against bright 
people 
ive done very well at the game but on occasion i got 
clipped he said

grain and soybean futures prices closed nearly 
unchanged tuesday on the chicago board of trade in a quiet period of 
adjustment after two days of volatile price movement 
new supplyanddemand developments were scarce the agriculture 
department issued a report in the afternoon that said last weeks 
cold temperatures and lack of snow cover may have damaged winter 
wheat in parts of the central and southern plains but the markets 
had anticipated some winter kill 
export demand for us grains and soybeans remained slack which 
weighed on prices but farmer selling was also slow prompting some 
domestic processors to raise their bids on the cash market which 
helped support futures 
analysts said forecasts for more snow this week in the plains and 
the midwest contributed to the generally bearish tone 
at the close wheat was 1 cent lower to cent higher with the 
contract for delivery in march at 426 a bushel corn was cent 
to cent lower with march at 266 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 
2 cents lower with march at 213 a bushel soybeans were 2 cents 
lower to cent higher with march at 753 a bushel

champion spark plug cos directors met 
tuesday to consider an 800 million cash takeover offer from cooper 
industries inc and there were indications a deal could be worked 
out 
a cooper takeover of champion would derail a previously announced 
590 million cashandsecurities deal for toledobased dana corp to 
acquire the spark plug maker 
no definitive action was taken by the board at a regularly 
scheduled meeting today beyond the decision to explore the cooper 
proposal champion spokesman anthony mougey said 
but mougey added that champion has begun meeting with cooper to 
discuss the deal 
o lee henry champions president and chief executive officer 
met monday with cooper officials at coopers houston headquarters 
henry agreed to coopers request for access to confidential 
financial information as well as granting access to its plants and 
offices 
cooper on monday offered to buy champion for at least 21 a 
share outbidding danas 1750 a share agreement to acquire the 
company announced last month 
a member of champions founding family who also is chairman of 
the board said he would probably go along with coopers offer 
i havent had time to digest it said robert stranahan jr 
74 but theyve been around for a good many years and theyve 
diversified a great deal have a lot of different products and are a 
very strong company 
stranahan said he couldnt predict whether champions board or a 
family run limited partnership that controls 35 percent of the 
companys stock would approve the deal the stranahan family in 1986 
established the partnership to maintain a dominant voice in 
champions affairs 
cooper a diversified maker of commercial and industrial 
products indicated it might bid even higher for the company 
spokeswoman ellen myers said the two sides were moving forward with 
the deal 
dana spokesman don decker declined comment on coopers offer and 
would not say whether the automotive parts maker would increase its 
bid 
joseph phillippi an automotive industry analyst wih shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york said champion would fit well into 
coopers product lines 
theres no product overlap and spark plugs provide them with 
another product line for the automotive aftermarket he said 
phillippi also said cooper is aggressive in reducing costs 
saying they do a lot of streamlining is putting it mildly he 
said 
cooper has owned toledoarea companies the company closed magnum 
electric co of erie mich and magnum tool of toledo a division 
of its belden eletronic wiring amp cable unit in 1986 idling 120 
workers 
ms meyers said cooper probably would move champions corporate 
headquarters from toledo to houston and keep the toledo plant intact 
champion is the worlds leading manufacturer of spark plugs for 
all types of internal combustion engines it also makes anco 
windshield wiper blades and a variety of other fuel system and 
automotive maintenance products it has annual revenue of about 720 
million and employs about 9200 people worldwide 
cooper with 1988 revenue of 43 billion is a diversified 
worldwide manufacturer of products for the electrical electronic 
commercial industrial compression and drilling market

the government must further slash its budget 
deficit and raise 36 billion in fresh foreign credits over the next 
six years to pull mexico out of an economic crisis a private study 
concluded tuesday 
the study by the panamerican private management institute was 
released as mexicos treasury secretary pedro aspe was in washington 
attempting to renegotiate payment terms on mexicos 106 billion 
foreign debt mexico has rejected a 35 billion aid package in us 
shortterm loans as too onerous 
the panamerican institute said the government must lower its 
budget deficit to at least 64 percent of gross national product 
the value of the total output of goods and services from 149 
percent in 1987 and estimated 10 percent this year 
it also said president carlos salinas de gortaris administration 
should seek an average of 6 billion annually over the next six 
years in longterm loans from abroad so the economy which remained 
virtually stagnant during the preceding administration can resume 
growth 
the institute is an arm of the private highly regarded 
panamerican university its findings appeared to reinforce salinass 
prescription of strong medicine for the sick economy 
the study also said the administration must sharply restrict the 
money supply to restrain inflation which hit an alltime high of 
159 percent in 1987 
it dropped to 517 percent last year as a result of tight 
restrictions on wage and retail price increases that began in the 
last year of president miguel de la madrids sixyear 
administration the plan was extended for another six months by 
salinas when he took office dec 1 
a treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
recent interview mexico would not use the us loan offered in 
october because it would mean even more burdensome debt payments 
instead of borrowing more money aspe is reportedly trying to 
reduce the existing debt as well as lower interest payments 
mexico has paid a total of 18 billion in principal and interest 
to foreign creditors in the past two years money that could have 
been used for investment and public works 
the study warned that unless the deficit was cut and new money 
brought in inflation will start growing again at an enormous 
political cost that would result in social unrest and loss of 
control by the government over its economic policies 
a measure of relief is apparently in sight with recent increases 
in world prices for crude oil a major source of mexicos foreign 
income the newspaper el financiero said tuesday 
mexico exports an average of 1325 million barrels a day about 
half of it to the united states price drops in 1987 cut oil income 
from 78 billion to about 52 billion in 1988 
el financiero also quoted unnamed government officials as saying 
the government plans to crack down on tax evaders so that tax 
revenues this year will surpass the income from oil exports 
tax collecting became increasingly lax during the de la madrid 
administration mostly because people and businesses were short of 
money because of the crisis which began in 1982 when the bottom 
fell out of the international oil market

mcdonnell douglas corp and general electric 
corp emerged as the big winners tuesday in an american airlines 
contract for up to 142 planes potentially one of the biggest 
aircraft orders in history 
american said it signed an agreement with mcdonnell douglas to 
acquire at least eight new longrange mdll jetliners with options 
to buy another 42 the airline also took options on 100 md80s a 
smaller plane designed to replace the boeing 727 
the order will make american the first us airline to obtain 
delivery of the md11 a widebody aircraft designed to replace the 
older dc10 company officials told a news conference 
company officials wouldnt disclose the value of the deal but 
industry experts estimate it could total around 7 billion it marks 
a major coup for mcdonnell douglas which has been aggressively 
seeking orders for the md11 in the highstakes aircraft competition 
with boeing co and the airbus industrie consortium of europe 
american also announced that it has signed an agreement with 
general electric to acquire up to 200 cf680c2 engines for use on 
most of its widebody jets including the md11 
american had considered competing engines made by pratt amp whitney 
and britains rollsroyce plc american officials said but decided 
that the ge engines provide more flexibility since they can be used 
on both the md11 and other aircraft 
in a related development tuesday mcdonnell douglas announced 
that in addition to american four other airlines have signed orders 
for new md11s the four carriers air europe of britain aero 
lloyd of west germany zas airline of egypt and finnair the 
national airline of finland have ordered a total of 26 md11s the 
aircraft maker said 
american chose the md11 over boeing cos rival 747400 largely 
because the mcdonnell douglas aircraft will be available sooner 
said robert l crandall americans chairman and president 
the acquisitions by american the nations secondlargest 
carrier come amid rising concern about aging us commercial 
aircraft fleets and whether older planes are less safe 
some airline analysts view the purchases as part of an innovative 
marketing strategy at american to reassure the public about safety 
the new aircraft will replace some older planes in americans 
fleet which is an average of 94 years old compared with 124 
years industrywide 
the agreement gives american great flexibility in planning for 
fleet growth and aircraft replacement in the 1990s and beyond 
crandall said 
one of the most valuable commodities an airline has is the 
confidence of the flying public he said in addition to upgrading 
its fleet american also is paying strict attention to inspecting 
and maintaining its older aircraft he noted 
as a result of the new acquisitions americans fleet will be the 
youngest in the us airline industry by the end of 1991 crandall 
said 
american plans to spend around 105 billion through the end of 
1993 to modernize its fleet donald j carty the airlines senior 
vice president for planning and finance told the news conference

a judge temporarily barred a national pennystock 
brokerage house from soliciting new business in new york state 
tuesday after the state attorney general said there was evidence it 
had defrauded millions of dollars from thousands of investors 
attorney general robert abrams said records showed that power 
securities corp of las vegas participated in a massive fraud and 
swindle that involved manipulating stock prices creating 
artificial markets and marking up stock prices by 100 percent or 
more 
state supreme court justice jawn a sandifer issued a temporary 
restraining order barring power securities from soliciting new 
business in or from the state the judge also ordered the company to 
provide documents and sworn testimony 
power securities issued a statement saying it would cooperate 
with the inquiry and present relevant information at a feb 22 
hearing however the statement said the company intends to 
vigorously oppose the existing restraining order and any 
restrictions order and any restrictions on its business activities 
penny stocks are inexpensive securities sold over the counter 
they are not listed on any major stock exchanges 
power securiti 62 of denver 
it employs 106 salespeople in four offices in new york state and 
400 more around the country are registered to solcompany grew 20fold in 
just over 18 
months and that the company claimed it had grown 50fold he said 
some brokers made 100000 a month 
under state securities law the attorney general can apply for a 
restraining order if he shows that investors are in danger of being 
defrauded 
abrams said deception and fraudulent conduct are at the very 
heart of their business enterprise he said the temporary order 
would help the state gather information that could lead to a lawsuit 
to permanently bar the company from doing business in the state 
according to an affidavit signed by assistant attorney general 
william h mohr salespeople used coordinated buyandsell campaigns 
to create an artificial intramural market and make a profit 
salespeople would tell one group of investors to sell while telling 
another group to buy he said 
abrams cited as an example the alleged manipulation of genexus 
international inc stock from oct 19 to oct 25 1988 
salespeople allegedly convinced one group of investors to sell 82 
million shares back to power for 22 cents per share or less and 
within five days resold the shares to another group for 3 cents a 
share leaving a profit of at least 650000 for power abrams said 
state and federal authorities have recently focused on potential 
fraud in penny stock deals which offer the illusion of quick 
profits for investors and involve littleknown companies 
abrams said the penny stock market is ripe for fraud companies 
like power securities find it an easy market in which to use lies 
and deception to enrich themselves 
mohrs affidavit was based partly on records filed with the state 
to register salespeople tape recordings of phone sales pitches 
statements and records of companies whose stocks are sold by power 
and interviews with former salespeople and disgruntled investors 
the affidavit also said there was evidence that power marked up 
the price of shares it bought from other brokers by as much as 100 
percent and resold them without disclosing the original price 
the judges order also froze the assets of star publications inc 
of colorado and sought records of its principals abrams charged 
that in conjunction with power securities star fraudulently claimed 
it had marketing rights to a folding disposable razor and claimed 
the defense department was about to buy large quantities of them

ford motor co has resumed delivery of 
thunderbird and cougar automobiles after holding thousands of them 
because of a bad bolt in the steering gear mount the company said 
tuesday 
spokesman john spelich said about 10600 cars were withheld after 
being built at the companys assembly plant in lorain ohio after a 
rattle found by inspectors jan 25 and by two customers later 
delivery off the assembly line resumed monday spelich said 
inspectors will check each of the cars that were withheld and if 
defective bolts are found they will be replaced spelich said most 
of the cars withheld were parked at a lot at the cedar point 
amusement park about 30 miles west of lorain 
the rattle noticed in all versions of the ford thunderbird and 
mercury cougar was caused by a bad bolt in a small percentage of 
the cars being checked spelich said he declined to specify how 
many cars had the defective bolts 
he said ford officials knew of no safety problems or accidents 
linked to the problem 
there are no plans for recalling the cars spelich added 
the steering mount bolt was the latest piece of bad news for the 
plant production of the thunderbird sc and cougar xr7 has been 
curtailed pending a changeover from cast to forged crankshafts on 
the supercharged engines both cars carry 
spelich said the company expects to resume full production of the 
two models next month the thunderbird sc last month was named motor 
trend magazines car of the year

salomon inc on tuesday reported a 38 million 
loss in the fourth quarter due to a special 150 million charge for 
repatriating foreign earnings to the united states 
the financial services and commodity trading company said the 
loss for the three months ended dec 31 resulted from a previously 
announced decision to remit more than 1 billion in foreign earnings 
to the united states and pay taxes on those earnings 
partly offsetting that 180 million charge was a 30 million 
reduction in loanloss reserves permitted by a significant 
reduction in the lending activities of the commercial finance 
segment before the charge the companys net income was 112 
million 
in the yearago fourth quarter salomon had reported a 74 
million loss revenue totaled 18 billion up from 13 billion in 
the fourth quarter of 1987 
for all of 1988 salomons net income nearly doubled to 280 
million or 165 a share from 142 million or 86 cents a share 
in 1987 revenue rose to 615 billion from 6 billion the previous 
year 
salomon said the companys 1988 earnings were bolstered by strong 
results from its oil operations 
the performance of the energy segment was exceptional and 
provided a counterbalance to sluggish securities markets said 
john gutfreund salomon chairman and chief executive officer 
the fourthquarter results despite the loss were helped by the 
energy divisions record 143 million pretax earnings versus 4 
million in the same period of 1987 
the companys salomon brothers financial subsidiary earned 68 
million before taxes compared with a 90 million loss in the 1987 
quarter its commercial finance unit earned 83 million including 
the 30 million reduction in loanloss reserves up from 45 million 
in the yearearlier quarter 
partly offsetting those improvements was a decline in the 
commodities units pretax earnings to 16 million from 57 million 
in the 1987 quarter salomon said

president bushs plan to dismantle the 
independent regulatory structure for savings and loan institutions 
may be the beginning of the end of the specialized system of home 
mortgage lending industry officials and analysts said tuesday 
bushs proposal in addition to hitting taxpayers for half of a 
90 billion problem calls for the most sweeping regulatory overhaul 
since federal deposit insurance agencies were established in 1933 
specifically the president would 
strip the sampl insurance fund the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp from its parent agency the federal home loan bank 
board and merge it into the federal deposit insurance corp which 
guarantees bank deposits 
take whats left of the bank board and make it part of the 
treasury department the comptroller of the currency part of the 
department has regulated national banks since the civil war 
this is the most comprehensive restructuring of the thrift 
regulatory structure that we will see in our lifetime said 
kenneth a guenther executive vice president of independent bankers 
association of america 
guenther whose group represents small commercial banks said the 
bush proposal addresses one of the root causes of todays sampl 
problems coziness between the bank board and the industry it was 
supposed to be regulating 
the federal home loan bank board has been the sweetheart 
regulator of the thrift industry guenther said bushs plan 
ensures that never again will there be such sweetheart regulators 
and never again will we have to undergo this type of comprehensive 
restructuring 
the enlarged fdic within two years would force sampls to comply 
with stricter regulatory standards that now apply only to banks 
sampl owners will also be required to put up more of their own 
money by june 1991 the capital standard for sampls would double from 
the current 3 percent to 6 percent which is now the standard for 
banks 
thus sampls would lose many of the competitive advantages they 
have enjoyed while still operating with one major disadvantage as 
they have since 1985 and are expected to into the forseeable future 
thrifts would pay higher deposit insurance premiums than banks 
the bush plan raises sampl premiums from 208 per 1000 in 
deposits to 230 bank premiums would go from 83 cents to 150 
bert ely a financial institutions analyst in alexandria va 
said thrifts would have so much trouble raising new capital and 
paying higher premiums that the federal reserve board could be 
pressured into allowing bank holding companies to buy sampls 
were going to see a lot of crossindustry mergers he said 
bud koch chairman of the national council of savings 
institutions said sampls should be given more time to meet the 
capital standard and warned that the government could wind up 
creating more failures 
what theyve done is put the industry in a straitjacket put it 
into the corner and said were going to tax you out of 
existence koch said 
meanwhile fdic officials estimated at a briefing tuesday that 
the premium increase could put several dozen weak commercial banks 
in danger of failure but said premiums might be eased for those 
banks 
robert litan a banking expert with the brookings institution 
said the bank board as part of the treasury department would not 
necessarily be any less receptive to influence by sampls 
i think this is just a very initial tentative step toward 
merging the two industries the way i read between the lines is 
the bush people have decided not to tackle the very tough political 
issue of ending the thrift industry i clearly think theyre 
looking at this in stages but theyre not going public on what the 
next stage is he said 
nevertheless the sampl industrys chief lobbying group the us 
league of savings institutions is gearing up to fight 
it is a proposal it is no more of a done deal than a budget is 
when the president sends it to congress the fact is it is the 
white house and the treasurys wish that does not translate into it 
becoming fact said mark clark a senior vice president of the sampl 
association 
a key sampl ally in the fight will be rep frank annunzio dill 
the chairman of the house banking subcommittee with jurisdiction 
over thrifts annunzio is a longtime advocate of an oldfashioned 
thrift industry catering to home mortgage borrowers 
treasury has long shown that it does not favor a separate home 
lending agency once it got its hands on control of the feeral home 
loan bank board it would move to eliminate the industry annunzio 
predicted 
thrift executives are pointing privately to treasury secretary 
nicholas f bradys ties to wall street where he headed the 
investment banking firm of dillon read amp co as evidence of a bias 
against thrifts 
according to a financial industry source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity the question of subsuming the bank board into the 
treasury department was hotly debated within the bush administration 
richard breeden the bush aide in charge of sampl matters pushed 
strongly for the treasury oversight and was backed by federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan at a luncheon meeting with bush 
saturday at the camp david md presidential retreat the source 
said

coffee futures rallied for the fourth straight day tuesday as 
reawakened fears of tightening supplies stirred new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange 
on other markets copper futures prices gained following an 
extended string of losses gold and silver futures fell livestock 
and meat energy and grain and soybean futures were mixed 
coffee futures settled 155 cents to 334 cents higher with the

above the psychologically important 140 level since jan 23 
the march contract has risen by 923 cents a pound a gain of 
nearly 7 percent over the past four sessions the advance has been 
fueled partly by concerns about the tight availability of coffee for 
delivery against the march contract and partly by fears that a 
continuation of the sharp price decline witnessed during the last 
two weeks of january could trigger a cutback in producer shipments 
the international coffee organization a pricecontrol group 
composed of the largest coffee producer and consumer countries 
would be required to order a 1millionbag reduction in exports of 
robusta coffee beans if an indicator based on the 15day moving 
average of cash coffee prices falls to 120 a pound 
the indicator stood at 12259 at the close of business on 
tuesday 
although the indicator would have to drop even further before 
affecting shipments of the arabica coffee beans traded in new york 
it makes some people apprenhensive that if the cut were imposed 
it would lead to shortages said arthur stevenson an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc 
the prospect of a general labor strike in brazil the worlds 
largest coffee producer also contributed to the bullish tone 
brazils two major unions have scheduled a meeting on feb 13 to set 
a strke date 
copper futures surged on new yorks commodity exchange after 
falling sharply in five of the six previous sessions 
analysts attributed the advance to technical factors and 
increased buying of actual copper 
copper settled 115 cents to 260 cents higher with march at 
1315 a pound 
gold and silver futures slipped lower on the commodity exchange 
in reaction to the dollars gains against other major currencies and 
the continuing outlook for low inflation 
gold settled 140 to 170 lower with april at 39550 a troy 
ounce silver was 39 cents to 47 cents lower with march at 589 a 
troy ounce 
hog futures prices steadied on the chicago mercantile exchange 
following mondays steep decline but pork belly futures fell again 
on selling linked to an unexpected increase in hog slaughters

7567 cents a pound feeder cattle were 15 cent lower to 15 cent

the automobile spotlight turns to chicago this 
week as the nations oldest auto show gets under way saturday 
featuring a trio of new japanese sports cars 
mazda motor corp honda motor co and nissan motor corp each 
have scheduled introductions of twoseaters for the nineday show 
mazdas mx5 is in some sense a throwback to a simpler time in 
motoring history hondas offering is a futuristiclooking new model 
for its upscale acura line and nissans is an updated version of 
its 300zx 
general motors corp and chrysler corp market small numbers of 
twoseaters in the united states gm sells the buick reatta the 
chevrolet corvette and the cadillac allante whose body is made in 
italy chrysler offers the tc made by maserati of italy using many 
chrysler parts 
ford got out of the twoseater business earlier in the 1980s when 
it dropped its escort exp to devote production capacity to its 
regular escort line of subcompacts 
theyre all twoseaters but theyre different classes auto 
analyst kathleen heaney of nikko securities co international inc 
said of the us cars 
its a niche here and a niche there she said everybody is 
going to be niched to death 
the new acura will have an estimated sticker price of 55000 
honda has released few details on the model 
mazdas latest entry into the twoseater market resembles the 
lotus elan from the 1960s inside and out according to photos in 
trade and autobuff magazines missing is a lot of todays glitzy 
digital instrumentation replaced by basic dials and gauges its 
expected to cost about 13000 when it arrives in showrooms this 
summer 
the 300zx is a new design under an old name its shorter and 
wider than the current 300zx the latest in a series of zcars 
that began in 1969 with the 240z then a datsun 
nissan also will exhibit for the first time its axxess minivan 
the company plans to import from japan later this year the 
minivans future is cloudy however 
the treasury department may rule that imported sportutility 
vehicles and minivans including the axxess will be subject to a 
25percent tariff that now is imposed on vehicles classified as 
trucks nissans thomas mignanelli executive vice president for 
us operations has said that the company may keep the axxess out 
of america if it is subject to the tariff 
few new products from us manufacturers are expected at the 
chicago show which is being challenged by a restyled auto show in 
detroit that show which ran jan 715 attracted more than a dozen 
concept cars and a variety of newcar introductions including those 
of two japanese luxury lines 
organizers of the detroit show said they wanted to bring the 
biggest and best auto show in the country back to motor city it 
attracted more than 636722 people this year 35 percent more than 
the show record set in 1986 
but the chicago show in its 81st year consistently has outdrawn 
the detroit show and has been the nations foremost display of new 
vehicles last year it drew 974432 people 
both shows are sponsored by local automobile dealer associations 
but the chicago show also includes displays from allied industries 
from carwax companies to dragracer makers 
more than 1000 vehicles will be on display in chicago about 300 
more than in detroit 
organizers in detroit argue they are limited by the size of cobo 
center which opened a 200000squarefoot addition just in time for 
the show giving the center a total of 600000 square feet of 
display space the chicago show uses mccormick place which is 
slightly larger at 650000 square feet

president bushs proposal for bailing out the 
savings and loan industry is receiving a lukewarm reaction from 
texas depositors but many in the state worst hit by the crisis say 
theyre glad to see some action 
sampl depositors visiting downtown dallas branches tuesday said 
they know that any bailout plan will cost them whether through the 
institution they use or as taxpayers 
one way or another well still end up paying for it either 
through lower interest rates on accounts or higher service 
charges said jeff estrachan a depositor at murray savings which 
has been losing money but is not insolvent 
estrachan said he doesnt know if anyone will find a better way 
to solve the thrift crisis which has afflicted many savings 
institutions in texas but im glad somebodys doing something 
cheryl harris 33 another murray depositor is worried about 
interest on her savings account i can finally put something 
savings away and now it looks like it wont be worth it 
itll probably end up the money i save will go to new taxes 
she said 
under bushs plan insurance premiums paid by sampls would increase 
from 208 cents to 23 cents per 100 deposit the premiums on bank 
deposits would rise from 83 cents per 100 to 12 cents 
the thrift plan would make the federal deposit insurance corp 
the insurer or thrifts as well as banks 
it also would tighten sampl regulatory procedures and boost funding 
for investigation of wrongdoing by 50 million 
sen phil gramm rtexas said any plan now is worth looking at 
this program does face up to it the sampl crisis but its sort of 
like kissing your motherinlaw 
kevin bain a depositor at sunbelt savings a new thrift that 
resulted from the merger of eight troubled savings institutions 
rescued by the government last year blames congress for the 
deepening crisis 
a policy gets put into place to protect us he said then 
some crook finds a way around it and everyonepays the warning signs 
were out there for congress years ago 
now it looks like well the taxpayers get screwed again 
bain said 
all three thrift customers agreed that fraud within the system is 
not being handled well by the justice system 
its just like armed robbery estrachan said those guys 
ought to be sent to huntsville prison just like any other felon 
they seem to be going too slow on catching the guys 
responsible harris said 
gramm reached in washington on tuesday said he will support 
bushs proposal but predicted it will be hard to sell to the 
industry and taxpayers 
after looking at every option i like this better than any 
alternative he said

texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower 
continued his push tuesday to allow exports of hormonefree texas 
beef to europe but federal officials say hightower is hindering 
their own negotiations in the latest useuropean trade dispute 
hightower is proposing a plan to that certify beef is 
hormonefree based on guidelines from european economic community 
veterinarians he contends texas suppliers and the us department 
of agriculture could quickly meet the standards and regain this 
export market 
this is in essence the same verification procedure used by 
all of our competitors for their sales of this specialty product to 
european importers if they can do it we can do it better 
hightower said 
the eec has banned imports of hormonetreated beef because of 
health concerns over the growth stimulants cutting off a 100 
million market for us producers the united states retaliated by 
setting 100 million in higher tariffs on a variety of common market 
goods 
usda officials said they would not comment on hightowers plan 
until they review it jane adams a spokeswoman for the agencys 
food safety and inspection service said a copy of hightowers 
proposal had not been received by tuesday afternoon 
but on monday acting secretary peter myers said the bottom 
line is here we have a trade representative trying to negotiate with 
europe and one person trying to to their own thing it doesnt help 
our negotiation process 
at his confirmation hearing last week agriculture 
secretarydesignate clayton yeutter said hightowers actions were 
undercutting us efforts in a very major way and that it would 
help to have him on our side rather than their side 
myers who is running usda pending yeutters senate confirmation 
said he would have to review hightowers proposal but anything we 
do will have to fit any packing company in the united statesif 
and when we do it 
myers said hightower obviously does things for political 
reasons so you have to suspect whats going on 
hightower a democrat contends he simply is trying to expand 
markets for texas producers 
national leaders on both sides of the atlantic should help 
agriculture make trades not war hightower said tuesday 
under hightowers plan producers would file federal affidavits 
certifying their cattle were produced without artificial growth 
stimulants 
texas beef shipped to europe would receive the same usda 
certification now authorized for selling hormone and growth 
stimulantfree beef to us customers hightower said 
usda alao would perform urine and fecal tests on one of every 
2000 live animals destined for european export to determine if

the federal reserves war against inflation 
passed a milestone tuesday as shortterm interest rates exceeded 
longterm rates by one widely watched measure for the first time 
since april 1982 
the feds tightmoney policy could mean higher rates on mortgages 
and consumer loans in the weeks ahead but in the long run it should 
bring down inflation and interest rates analysts say 
the ultimate message is that markets expect future inflation to 
be lower than current inflation said lawrence kudlow chief 
economist of bear stearns amp co 
some other analysts said the switch could spell trouble noting 
that past flipflops in short and longterm rates often reflected 
credit crunches that led to recessions 
if banks raise their prime lending rate to cope with the squeeze 
by the fed a whole range of consumer rates that are tied to the 
prime automatically would rise the prime rate is 105 percent and 
many analysts predict it soon will be raised to 11 percent 
longterm rates are ordinarily higher than shortterm rates 
because investors demand higher yields in return for the risk of 
keeping their money locked up for longer periods 
but for the last year shortterm rates have been rising and 
longterm rates falling trends that culminated in tuesdays 
flipflop 
the rise in shortterm rates has been brought about by the 
federal reserve which uses the higher rates to discourage 
borrowing cool off the economy and prevent inflation from getting 
out of hand 
meanwhile the feds tactics have won the confidence of 
inflationwary investors because they are no longer demanding such 
a big premium to keep their money tied up in bonds longterm rates 
have fallen 
the socalled inversion of the yield curve occurred tuesday 
morning by the end of the day the yield on the treasurys 
threemonth treasury bill was at 882 percent and the yield on the 
benchmark 30year bond stood at 879 percent 
by some other measures say comparing yields on the 30year 
bond and the oneyear note the inversion in yields had already 
occurred 
kudlow said the inversion in yields signals a decline in 
inflation that will be good for both stocks and bonds 
skeptics say the federal reserve does not have a delicate hand on 
the tiller of the economy and is very likely to cause a recession by 
pushing shortterm rates too high 
since the civil war all 22 times the yield curve has inverted 
there has been a recession or a growth recession in which 
industrial production declined according to raymond dalio 
president of bridgewater associates in wilton conn 
dalio said tuesday that a flat yield curve is necessary for now 
because the united states needs high shortterm rates to attract 
foreign money and prop up the value of the dollar but he said if 
the fed overdoes the tightening which he expects there will be a 
deep downturn emerging at the end of 89 or the beginning of 90 
the current situation perplexes money managers who have to decide 
whether to put money into shortterm or longterm debt securities 
said dale krieger managing director of carnegie hill asset 
management in new york 
on one hand managers can get guaranteed annual returns of 9 
percent by putting money into shortterm instruments but by doing 
so they miss the chance to get in at the start of what some believe 
will be a bull market in bonds brought on by declining inflation 
krieger said his firms clients are playing it safe passing up 
speculation in the bond market and pulling in unusually high yields 
on shortterm debt for us this is a gift he said

federal regulators wasting no time in 
implementing portions of president bushs savings and loan rescue 
plan announced tuesday that they had begun taking control of more 
than 200 insolvent savings and loans institutions which are still 
operating 
officials of the federal deposit insurance corp which insures 
deposits at commercial banks and the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp which performs the same function for sampls 
announced that combined regulatory teams from the two agencies had 
been put into place at four insolvent sampls located in maryland 
florida california and texas 
within a month officials said they hoped to have federal 
regulatory teams in place at approximately 224 sampls which are still 
operating even though they are technically insolvent 
the announcement came just a day after bush unveiled the 
administrations plan to overhaul the sampl industry officials said 
they were moving with dispatch to emphasize the urgency of the 
problem 
officials said that all of the insolvent sampls would continue 
normal operations however their operating decisions will be 
subject to approval from the federal regulators the institutions 
will remain under government control until regulators can find 
buyers 
regulators were urged to take this action last week by the 
general accounting office the auditing arm of congress the gao 
said that the sick sampls needed to be effectively isolated from 
the healthy segment of the industry 
in the past the sick sampls have been able to offer higher rates 
of return in an effort to attract depositors money thereby bidding 
up the cost of funds for the total industry and increasing the 
ultimate cost to the government of bailouts 
estimates have been that the industrys losses including the 
insolvent institutions which were allowed to continue operating was 
adding 1 billion a month to the total bailout cost 
the four institutions taken over on tuesday were baltimore 
federal financial of maryland freedom savings and loan association 
of tampa fla pacific savings bank of costa mesa calif and gill 
savings association of hondo texas 
two of the institutions freedom and gill were already under 
government control in a supervisory program run by sampl regulators 
under the new initiative announced tuesday the sampl regulators will 
be joined by regulators from the fdic and other federal banking 
agencies 
if you walked by the institution the next day the only way you 
are going to be able to tell we are in there is there will be a few 
more people in the offices said fdic chairman l william seidman 
officials said that between 1200 and 1500 government regulators 
will be involved in the massive supervisory undertaking half from 
the fdic and the sampl agencies and the other half from the federal 
reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency 
seidman said that the government regulators would be seeking to 
minimize operating losses at the institutions eliminate speculative 
lending practices and seek out and halt any continuing practices of 
insider abuse and fraud 
bushs plan to overhaul the sampl industry which the president 
unveiled monday calls for the fdic to take administrative control 
of fslic the sampl insurance fund 
while the funds contributed by banks and sampls would be kept 
separate the fdic would manage both insurance funds in bushs 
proposal the total takeover of the sampl insurance fund by the fdic 
would require congressional approval 
however the joint supervisory effort did not need congressional 
approval to be implemented 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
which oversees fslic emphasized that the employees of both the fdic 
and fslic would strive to work in full cooperation and harmony 
officials said that while about three or four of the 224 
insolvent institutions would be closed in most cases the government 
regulators would keep the insolvent institutions open until congress 
comes up with the 50 billion rescue package recommended by bush 
wall said the institutions were being taken over by government 
regulators on a priority basis which would deal first with the 
largest insolvent institutions that were losing money at the most 
rapid clip the four institutions taken over on tuesday all had loan 
portfolios and other assets in excess of 1 billion 
both democrats and republicans on tuesday pledged to seek a 
bipartisan solution to the sampl crisis and praised bush for acting 
decisively in the early days of his administration 
senate banking committee chairman donald riegle dmich said he 
and sen jake garn of utah the panels ranking republican would 
jointly sponsor the administrations package riegle said he hoped 
to schedule hearings in the next two weeks in his committee to begin 
ironing out differences concerning the plan 
i am determined to see us act quickly in the committee to match 
the speed of the administration riegle said when we are losing 
on the order of 33 million a day from sampl operating losses all 
of us are under enormous responsibilities to get this package done 
his counterpart house banking committee chairman henry b 
gonzalez dtexas also pledged quick action by his committee 
saying he hoped to vote on the bill in the committee by the first 
week in march 
the bush proposal in addition to making changes in the way sampls 
are regulated proposes raising the estimated 90 billion cost of 
bailing out the sampl industry through a combination of tax dollars 
and higher insurance premiums paid by banks and sampls 
some members of the senate banking committee questioned whether 
the funding approach represented the proper mix between taxpayer 
money and industry funds but senators were generally supportive of 
the overall approach 
former federal reserve chairman paul volcker testifying before 
the committee on the sampl crisis also urged quick congressional 
action on the bush package saying he believed it addressed all the 
major problems facing the sampl industry 
volcker did say he was concerned that deposit insurance premiums 
not be raised to such a level that they harmed the ability of sampls 
and banks to compete with other industries in offering financial 
services

holly farms corps board of directors on 
tuesday recommended the companys stockholders approve a merger 
agreement with conagra inc instead of a rival proposal from tyson 
foods inc 
the board said conagras stockswap proposal was substantially 
equal to a tyson proposal to pay 6350 per share if holly farms 
agreed to a merger and had less strings attached tyson also has an 
outstanding 60 a share hostile cash tender offer for holly farms 
the company said a stockholders meeting would be convened as soon 
as possible to vote on a merger with conagra 
conagras deal has been valued at about 106 billion and tysons 
109 billion 
the holly farms board said there were reasons to doubt that a 
deal with tyson could be completed 
this was due to the prospect of protracted litigation between 
conagra and tyson foods the company said 
the holly farms board said an opinion from investment banker 
morgan stanley amp co said the terms of the conagra agreement were 
fair to hollys stockholders 
holly farms shares lost 12 cents to close at 6162 in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading 
tyson on monday extended its cash tender offer for the company 
for another week officials for the company deferred calls tuesday 
to attorneys in new york who were not available for comment 
conagra an omaha nebbased food and poultry processor and 
tyson of springdale ark have been seeking holly farms for months 
holly based in memphis tenn had intended to merge with 
conagra but later encouraged both suitors to up their offers in 
order to maximize the gain for shareholders in the event of a sale 
the boards announcement was the second major setback to tyson in 
the past several days last monday a federal judge barred tyson 
from issuing false or misleading information about its takeover 
offers for holly farms 
the company since its board meeting of jan 20 had invited 
tyson and conagra to improve the terms of their respective 
proposals the holly statement said conagra had made no 
changes tyson had added a condition to theirs and that along with 
the prospect of litigation between tyson and conagra had led the 
board to conclude that their concerns over the tyson proposal were 
even more acute than before 
holly spokesman ted bailey said the company would mail statements 
to shareholders soon seeking their approval of the conagra deal

plessey co plc on tuesday rejected as 
outrageous a revised proposal by britains general electric co 
plc and west germanys siemens ag aimed at obtaining british 
government approval for a joint bid for plessey 
this is absolutely no way to decide on the future of key 
sectors of the british and european electronics industry stephen 
walls plesseys managing director said in a statement 
gec and siemens announced new proposals monday for dividing up 
various plessey businesses should their takeover bid for the 
electronics and defense contractor succeed 
the revised plan submitted to the monopolies and mergers 
commission which is investigating the bid was an attempt to calm 
british government concerns about maintaining competition in the 
electronics industry 
walls called the new restructuring proposals a good 
oldfashioned carveup of an aggressive competitor by two tired 
european monolithic enterprises 
the plessey official also complained about the timing of the 
move which provided only the minimum amount of time for proper 
discussion and review 
the 296 billion bid for plessey was referred to the monopolies 
commission nearly a month ago the commission was given three months 
to conclude its investigation and decide whether the bid should be 
allowed to procede

few industry analysts expect a repeat of last 
years record orders for commercial jets but one manufacturer says 
the demand to replace aging aircraft is high enough to cover 450 
billion in new orders by 2005 
american airlines got the 1989 sales year off to a big start 
tuesday by announcing a contract with mcdonnell douglas corp for up 
to 142 planes the deal was estimated to be worth as much as 7 
billion 
the order potentially one of the biggest ever could eclipse 
last septembers order by delta air lines for up to 215 planes from 
boeing co and mcdonell douglas valued at 6 billion to 10 billion 
boeing and airbus industrie the european consortium and third 
player in the commercial airliner manufacturing market split a 
504 billion order for 130 planes placed last may by international 
lease finance corp for 130 planes 
demand is outpacing production at all three say analysts who 
noted that americans order from mcdonnell douglas ensures the 
carrier will have planes ready in the near future 
furthermore the overall new plane market shows signs of strength 
in coming years according to boeing the company estimates the nwere 
essentially sold out on 
that airplane up to the 9293 period he said 
boeing spokesman david jimenez said monday there is a waiting 
period for new boeing jets negotiable with each order but 
usually a couple of years out 
don hanson mcdonnell douglas spokesman in long beach calif 
said his companys delivery dates generally extend into 1993 
however there are always ways to be able to swap delivery 
positions to satisfy a customer hanson said
