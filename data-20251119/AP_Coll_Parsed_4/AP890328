authorities said they 
will cut off water and food to heavily armed rebellious convicts 
and about 600 family members inside a besieged prison if no accord 
is reached wednesday 
negotiations with the inmates stalled tuesday night as food for 
the nearly 2000 people in the prison complex grew scarce 
were at an impasse the rev antonio lopez martin chaplain 
of guatemalan prisons and one of the negotiators told journalists 
upon leaving the prison after dark 
the rebellion began on easter sunday and prison spokesman 
conrado monroy said tuesday night that as many as 12 people may 
have been killed the inmates armed themselves with carbines taken 
from the prison armory 
authorities had removed seven bodies from the grounds those of 
four guards and three convicts by tuesday about 20 people were 
wounded 
prisoners told negotiators three bodies remained on prison 
grounds and inmates buried two others after the fighting monroy 
said 
about 20 inmates not among the rebels were shipped to another 
jail tuesday they were seen leaving the prison handcuffed by 
twos and placed on a bus 
another six visitors who had been inside the prison since the 
sunday afternoon uprising also made their way out tuesday 
gonzalo menendez de la riva special attorney general for human 
rights indicated the main stumbling block in talks between 
government representatives and inmates was government unwillingness 
or inability to assure prisoners pardons for acts since seizing the 
pavon prison farm 14 miles east of guatemala city 
he said that the prisoners have the right to ask for pardons 
but the government is not in a position to award pardons 
rebels also have demanded reduced sentences better food and 
treatment and new prison management 
menendez gave the prison rebels a government promise not to beat 
or kill the rebellious prisoners and to intercede on their behalf 
with the supreme court which can offer judicial pardons 
monroy said tuesday night that if the rebels do not accept the 
offer wednesday water and food will be cut off 
he said much food was delivered monday night but it is almost 
all gone because of the large number of people inside 
president vinicio cerezo said the 1000 or more soldiers and 
police ringing the prison had orders to use force only if the 
prisoners try to shoot their way out 
about 600 easter visitors including hundreds of women and 
children have remained inside since the takeover 
cerezo said tuesday that drug traffickers may have sponsored the 
rebellion by up to 100 inmates who took over the central buildings 
of the 2squaremile prison farm 
authorities say the mutinous prisoners took over about 65 
percent of the facility including most important buildings lopez 
said the rebel leader was a military man who wore a hood and gave 
orders to the other mutineers 
pavon was designed for 800 inmates but now holds more than 1350 
they are desperate the rev jose maria varela said of the 
rebels when he left the facility 
he said inmates told him any negotiator who returned without an 
acceptable government offer would be taken hostage 
they are criminals who killed people and committed that same 
violent crime during the uprising he told reporters in the 
capital 
cerezo said there was probably a certain sum of money paid in 
the effort to gain access to the weapons and try a massive escape 
in which prisoners convicted of drug trafficking would take part 
but that was frustrated no prison guard personnel were involved in 
the plot 
he said traffickers involved in a shipment of cocaine seized in 
amatique bay in 1987 were part of the rebellion 
authorities disagreed whether visitors still inside were 
hostages or were there to support and protect the rebels 
lopez said he considered most of them virtual hostages 
though some are there by choice the rebellious prisoners know 
they the family members are their protection he said they 
know that once they are gone the armed forces could try to retake 
the facility 
carlos ramos moncada inspector general of prisons told the 
associated press he believed the visitors stayed of their own free 
will 
esmirla cheti 19 walked out tuesday with her nephew edgar 13 
she said they were visiting a friend when the uprising began and 
stayed voluntarily 
but we were also afraid about what might happen if we tried to 
leave she told reporters we were going to leave last night 
but they the prisoners told us to wait until morning

a palestinian sought by the united states 
for the 1982 bombing of a pan am jetliner was convicted tuesday of 
keeping makeshift knives in his jail cell and sentenced to eight 
months in prison 
mohammed rashid 39 has been jailed in piraeus since his arrest 
last may the us request for his extradition is still awaiting a 
decision by the supreme court 
a japanese teenager was killed and 15 people were injured when 
a bomb exploded aboard a pan am jumbo jet over hawaii the plane 
manged to land despite the hole in the fuselage 
in its verdict tuesday the threemember court of appeals gave 
rashid the option of paying a 620 fine instead of serving the 
eightmonth sentence 
greeces supreme court has twice delayed a decision on the us 
extradition petition 
the sentence for illegal possession of weapons could further 
delay any action on the extradition issue if rashid chooses not to 
pay the fine he would have to serve the jail sentence before he 
could be sent to the united states 
rashids lawyer spyros fitrakis told the court his client 
will remain jailed regardless of this decision as he is still 
waiting for the supreme court decision 
rashid claims his real name is mohammed hamdan and that he is an 
officer in the military branch of the palestine liberation 
organization the plo has provided him with a translator and has 
supported him since his arrest at the athens airport 
he told reporters during the trial i am innocent and am not a 
terrorist it is the us congress that thinks i am and is putting 
pressure on greece to send me there 
the illegal weapons charge was filed against rashid after knives 
were found by prison guards during a search of cells on feb 17 
rashid was acquitted at an earlier trial but piraeus district 
attorney antonis roussos took the case to the appeals court 
we find him guilty of illegal weapons possession but grant him 
a few mitigating circumstances said judge antonis papatheodorou 
before announcing the sentence 
the judge said the court found that rashid held onto the 
weapons because he honestly felt he feared for his life he felt he 
was under threat

takeover specialist carl c icahn hoped union concessions would 
persuade eastern creditors to let him take control 
ueberroths offer will be for 512 milllion would be financed 
by drexel burnham lambert inc and would give easterns unions a 30 
percent stake in the airline in exchange for wage concessions the 
new york times reported wednesday

meetings probably wouldnt get under way until wednesday texas air 
spokesman art kent in houston said the company wouldnt comment on

consider taking over the airline the unions have said they would 
make concessions if ueberroth took over possibly in return for

employees in the executive office of the 
president will have a hearing in a federal court in may on their 
suit charging that mandatory random drug tests are unnecessary and 
unconstitutional 
a hearing had been scheduled in us district court here for 
next month but at the request of the government it was postponed 
until may 11 so that the justice department could review a ruling 
by the supreme court last week 
the white house has agreed not to start testing until 10 days 
after the hearing if it is not prevented to do so by the court 
jeffrey f liss an american civil liberties union attorney who 
represents the employees said from kansas city on monday night 
that the supreme court decision did not answer the questions 
involved in the white house case 
it is clear that the court has left for another day the 
determination of the constitutionality of random testing he said 
the court allowed the government to test railroad workers after 
accidents and applicants for us customs service jobs involving 
drug interdiction 
in early january 30 white house employees sued president bush 
to block the testing one of more than 50 suits filed 
governmentwide to stop the urine sample drug tests 
although former president ronald reagan issued an executive 
office twoandonehalf years ago tests have not yet to begin in 
the white house complex 
the white house plans to test 1520 of 1850 employees in the 
agencies that make up the executive office of the president such as 
the office of management and budget the national security council 
the council of economic advisers the council on environmental 
quality and the office of the us trade representative 
liss sald these are extremely loyal people loyal to the 
president and loyal to government administration 
they just think random drug testing is unconstitutional not 
justified an invasion of their privacy and demeaning liss said

the federal reserve is likely to pause 
momentarily in its credittightening efforts but the interest rate 
relief will only be temporary many economists believe 
these analysts are forecasting that a variety of rates from 
banks prime lending rate to home mortgage rates will head higher 
in the months ahead with the only debate being over whether the 
central banks antiinflation campaign will wind up pushing the 
country into a recession 
fed policymakers were meeting today behind closed doors to 
review monetary targets the 12member federal open market 
committee composed of members of the fed board and regional fed 
bank presidents meets eight times a year to set interest rate and 
money growth policies 
todays session is an anniversary of sorts it was at the march 
meeting one year ago that the central bank decided to launch a 
gradual effort to drive shortterm interest rates higher in an 
effort to keep the economy from overheating 
since then shortterm rates have risen by more than 3 
percentage points more than the increases that preceded six of the 
past seven recessions according to researchers at merrill lynch 
while such statistics have trigg fears of a new recession 
the fed is likely toshing rates higher because inflationary 
pressurfar shown no signs of abating economists say 
inflation ate wholesale level has been racing ahead at an 
alarming annual rate of 126 percent in the first two months of 
this year and consumer prices have been climbing at a 61 percent 
annual rate up sharply from the 44 percent e in consumer 
prices turned in during the past the fed moved aggressively in february 
to tighten credit 
further including hiking its discount rate the in to make bank loans 
to 7 percent an increase in the 
discount te is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send 
of itsintentions to fight inflation with higher intereany private economists 
are not looking for an immediate move at 
todays meeting to tighter credit further in p federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan and other fed officials have 
indicated in recent comments that they are prepared to take a 
breather to review the effects of their earlier actionsecent weakness 
in retail sales factory orders and housing 
construction give some indication that the feds efforts are 
slowing growth but with inflationary pressures still 
many economists believe the fed will be forced to squeeze credit 
tighter even as evidence of a slowing economy mounts 
david jones an economist with aubry g lanston ampment securities dealer 
predicted that interest rates will 
remarly stable from april through june but that the credit tightening in 
early summer 
those moves will push fidrate mortgages now at 1122 
percent up to 1l jones said with other 
rates such as banks prime lending rate rising as well 
paul getman an economist with the wefa group an economic 
consulting firm forecast an even more rapid rise in interest 
rates saying he looked for the prime rate rrently at 115 
percent to climb to 12 percent by late april 
he said the fed was also likely to boost itcount rate over 
the next couple of months by onehalf percentage point to 75 
percent 
president bush hastedly said since taking office that the 
fed shoned about economic growth as well as inflation 
and 70 of 174 re the house fired off a letter to 
greenspan last week urging himest rates to avert a 
recession 
among private economists there is a split over whether the fed 
can achieve its goal of asoft landing which would see 
slow enough to cool down inflation but not topple the country into 
a recession 
david wyss chief financ for data resources inc a 
lexorecasting firm said he believes that the fed 
will be able to fight inflation d keep the sixyear economic 
relive 
we think the feds will work but the risks of a 
mistake are substantial he said 
however saying throughout history the 
soft landing hasnt worked it just isnt possible to fineconomy 
jones said he was looking for a recession but notar in part because 
the fed willighten aggressively until 
summer because of political pressure e white house 
one of theush administration is to put off 
this recession as long as posse that is why they are subtly 
not to tighten jones said

a missouri lawyer urging the supreme court to 
ban the death penalty for all juvenile killers said the issue is 
clear how young is too young to be executed 
after two hours of courtroom arguments monday the courts 
likely answer is far from clear 
the high court is to decide by july whether using the death 
penalty for murderers who committed their crimes before reaching 
age 18 represents the cruel and unusual punishment banned by 
the constitutions eighth amendment 
the justices are studying two death penalty cases one from 
missouri in which the killer was 16 and the other from kentucky in 
which the killer was 17 
the high court effectively drew the allowable capitalpunishment 
line at age 16 last year by a 53 vote it threw out the death 
penalty of an oklahoma killer who committed his crime when 15 
four members of the court justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall harry a blackmun and john paul stevens said 
then that the death penalty is unconstitutional for those younger 
than 16 
three chief justice william h rehnquist and justices byron r 
white and antonin scalia said the constitution does not set such 
age limits 
justice sandra day oconnor who asked only two neutral 
questions monday provided the majority with its fifth vote last 
year but stopped short of calling for abolition of capital 
punishment for killers under 16 
she will provide a key vote in the missouri and kentucky cases 
so too will justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court in 
february 1988 too late to participate in the oklahoma case 
kennedy asked numerous questions monday some of which focused 
on a jurys ability to take a defendants youth into account even 
if the death penalty is a possibility 
nancy mckerrow arguing on behalf of missouri death row inmate 
heath wilkins said there is a consensus opinion in this 
country against executing our young 
frank heft jr representing kentuck row inmate kevin 
stanford contended that peop 18 are children who have 
not evolved into adults and who have a tremendous capacity for 
change 
noting the lack of unanimity amoate legislatures the chief 
justice asked why should we set the bright line at 18 
ms mckerrow a lawyer from columbia mo answered that 18 is 
the age most commonly chosen for demarking the separation betweeood and 
adulthood 
she no0 missouri laws treat individuals under 18 
differently from those over 18 including a law thas 
juveniles from witnessing executions 
but lawyers for missouri and kentucky urged the jutices to 
leave any linedrawing to state legislatures 
wnational consensus asked missouri assistant 
attorney general john morris iiie said wilkins the convicted missouri 
killer c 
condemned in 22 states despite his age demonstrating an absence 
of a national consensus regarding a minimum age for executions 
kentucky attorney general frederic cowan said state legislatures 
may choose to exempt juveniles from the death penalty as a matter 
of mercy but argued the constitution is an instrument of 
justice not an instrument of mercy 
the courts decision will affect only about 30 of the nearly 
2200 death row inmates nationwide but anticapital punishment 
forces nevertheless are attaching enormous importance to the issue 
the justices were told that of the 36 states with capital 
punishment laws only 12 ban the death penalty for killers who were 
under 18 when they committed their crimes 
in other matters the court 
turned away arguments in an iowa case that allowing public 
hospitals to keep chaplains on their payrolls violates the 
constitutionally required separation of church and state 
agreed to use a pennsylvania case to restudy how far states may 
go in limiting a jurys discretion to choose life or death for 
convicted murderers 
let stand a 300000 award won by oregons former chief medical 
officer from the state health divisions administrator who fired 
him over an alleged slush fund 
refused to review a lawsuit by a pennsylvania supreme court 
justice against two newspapers that reported on what was to have 
been a confidential state investigation on his fitness fooffice 
agreed to decide in a north dakota case whether states may 
impose labeling and reporting requirements for liquor sold at us 
military bases within their borders

laboratory experiments by agriculture 
department scientists are raising hopes that contamination of 
chickens by food poisoning organisms can be reduced by adding a bit 
of sugar to their drinking water 
the encouraging tests involved ordinary lactose milk sugar 
and another sugar from a mediterranean plant 
preliminary results showed that the number of salmonella 
bacteria in infected chickens can be reduced by 999 percent in a 
significant number of the birds for a cost of pennies a day said 
usda biochemist john r deloach of the agricultural research 
service college station texas 
deloach said in a report issued here monday that lactose and 
dmannose were added to the drinking water of chicks dosed with 100 
million salmonella typhirmurium bacteria 
when the 10dayold chicks were compared with birds that had 
received the bacteria but no sugars only 53 percent of the birds 
on lactose and only 26 percent of those on dmannose had any 
salmonella bacteria he said 
its not only important how many birds had salmonella but how 
many salmonella bacteria those birds had deloach said the 
birds treated with either mannose or lactose had 999 percent fewer 
salmonella than the control birds in those experiments 
other sugars were tested too including glucose sucrose from 
cane sugar and maltose or malt sugar after 10 days all of the 
bacteriadosed birds on sucrose and glucose were infected as were 
90 percent of those treated with maltose 
lactose worked just as well as mannose and the cost of 
lactose in drinking water might be no more than two cents per 
bird deloach said right now if the poultry producer put his 
birds on dmannose for 10 days it would cost him 50 cents a bird 
the exact amount of bacterial contamination in poultry is 
unclear but usda and private estimates have ranged from 35 percent 
to 60 percent nationally salmonella and other organisms can be 
spread when slaughtered birds are put through eviscerating machines 
and their intestinal contents are spilled 
deloach was part of a team studying salmonella at the agencys 
veterinary toxicology research unit at college station 
dmannose is produced naturally by the fraxinus ornus plant 
along the mediterranean basin the report said the sugar 
seminose and carubinose is available commercially in the united 
states a sister compound mannitol has been used for years as a 
stabilizer and preservative in pharmaceutical products 
the report said dmannose reduces the ability of salmonella 
bacteria to settle in a chickens intestines forcing the organisms 
to pass harmlessly out of the bird studies are still under way on 
how lactose works

the denver city council voted monday to loosen its 
livinginsin zoning law so that unrelated people could legally 
live together in familyzoned areas 
the council voted 85 to initially approval to plans to change 
two types of zoning r0 which bans boarders or unrelated people 
from living in the same house and r1 which allows a boarder with 
a city permit 
the changes would allow two unrelated people plus close 
relatives with some exceptions to live together in areas zoned 
r0 and would permit one boarder related or unrelated without a 
city permit 
about 60 percent of the city 505000 people live under r1 
zoning and 7 percent fall under r0 
the changes in the socalled livinginsin law come up for 
second and final action april 24 
the amended laws would still forbid nieces nephews aunts 
uncles and inlaws from living together said city councilwoman 
cathy donohue 
right now you have to carry your marriage certificate in your 
pocket in denver donohue said before the vote 
there are some people who go around and deliberately turn 
other people in she said there is even one real estate agent 
who sells houses based on the current law telling buyers that no 
one can move in next to them that isnt married this appeals 
particularly to families 
the penalty for violating the citys ordinance is 999 a day in 
many cases if a person is turned in to authorities and owns the 
house they have to sell the house often at a losss donohue said 
donohue said families and one real estate agent are the main 
opponents of change 
among those affected by the ordinance are three nuns who are 
being forced to move out of a fourbedroom home 
they wanted all but one of us to move out said one of the 
nuns who asked that her name not be used to me its wasteful 
to have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms 
its very sinful 
the ban dates back to the 1960s when home owners in some of 
denvers most exclusive neighborhoods feared invasion by hippie 
communes 
so far hundreds of people have violated the ordinance 
including the mexican consul students sharing expenses and 
unmarried couples 
the law is being challenged in court

collective review said white house spokeswoman alixe glen the 
subject of semiautomatic weapons came up but no conclusions were 
made they dont feel their review has been completed 
bush who proudly notes in speeches his longtime membership in 
the national rifle association has been moving away from the nras 
hardline position that citizens have the right to keep and bear 
virtually any kind of weapon 
the apparent change of heart was prompted by widespread calls 
from police organizations nationwide as well as from the public for 
a ban on the weapons the calls were prompted by scores of 
drugrelated shootings and the january slayings of five children at 
a stockton calif school by a man armed with an ak47 
brady two weeks ago suspended imports of hundreds of thousands 
of the weapons including semiautomatic versions of the ak47 and 
uzi carbines pending a review of their use to determine if they 
meet the legal requirement that they are intended for such sporting 
purposes as hunting and target shooting 
the atf has estimated the review may take three to four months 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater called the meeting 
the first session of the principals since this review has begun 
and said that no decisions had been expected to emerge from it 
an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that 
among the items discussed at the meeting was legislation sponsored 
by sen howard metzenbaum dohio to require those wishing to own 
semiautomatic rifles to undergo fbi checks be fingerprinted and 
pay a 200 fee to the government 
also discussed were ways of strengthening the 2weekold ban on 
importation of semiautomatic firearms the official said 
bush called last week for a compromise on the issue of private 
ownership of the high load capacity rapidfire weapons because 
were in a very different time now 
i believe we can find an accommodation between the legitimate 
interest of sportsmen and the interests of police chiefs whose men 
put their lives on the line every day bush told a group of state 
legislators 
semiautomatic rifles fire one shot each time the trigger is 
pulled unlike automatic rifles which unleash a stream of bullets 
with each trigger pull in nonsemiautomatic rifles each round 
must be chambered with a separate manual action 
the suspension being imposed by atf ultimately could affect 
close to a halfmillion semiautomatic rifles 
initially atf suspended imports of more than 113000 of the 
res in five categories akstype firearms such as ak47s uzi 
carbines fnfal and fnfnctype weapons as well as steyr aug 
rifles those weapons had import ermits pending with atf but had 
not yet been apter the atf expanded the suspension to weapons for which 
import permits had been approved but which had not yet come into 
the country 
the expanded suspension could affect as many as 400000 
additional weapons atf spokesman dick pedersen estimated 
dot koester an atf spokeswoman said a gun importer must apply 
to the atf for permission to import a certain number of weapons 
and the permits once approved are gd for six months she said 
often what haens is that he will ask for approval in 
bringin0000 then he will bring in 1000 or 5000 or n 
ms koester said 
a number of permits had been approved prior to the suspension 
of the five groups of weapons two weeks ago but the guns had not 
yet gotten through customs and into the us marketplace she said 
blocking the importation ose weapons which already had 
approved import pwas always intended to be part of the 
process she said 
among the options facing the administration are ending the 
suspension and allowing the weapons to begin floodig the country 
again or making the suspension permanent 
in addition officials could call on us manufacturers 
unaffected by the suspension to follow the lead of colt industries 
which announced a dfter the suspension was imposed two weeks 
ago that it would temily halt sales of its ar15 semiautomatic 
rifle the ar15 is considered one of the most populasemiautomatic rifles 
and it is the usmade weapon most similar to 
the foreignmade guns being kept out of the country

the chairman of the us civil rights 
commission apologized for his conduct on an apache reservation in 
arizona but argued that his intentions in interviewing a 
14yearold girl there were practically heroic 
chairman william b allen in letters released monday by the 
commission compared himself to lenny skutnick who in january 1982 
dived into the icy potomac river to save victims of an air florida 
airliner crash in the capital 
allen on orders from other commission members wrote to lalita 
altaha and her parents im just an ordinary skutnick who dove 
into the cold water when the time came he said in both letters 
i am happy i was able to do that much 
but the commission chairman also said he regretted the events of 
feb 7 and apologized in another letter to the chairman of the 
white mountain apache nation 
allen and commission consultant barry goodfield accompanied by 
an nbc television crew had taken the child into their car and 
interviewed her after picking her up at a reservation school 
the girl complained in the interview that she was an outcast 
on the reservation she had been reared by a white family that 
adopted her and took her off the reservation as a baby a tribal 
court nullified the adoption and the girl recently was returned to 
her natural parents 
her natural mother thurza altaha angrily brushed off allens 
questions when he and goodfield arrived at their home with the 
girl mrs altaha called tribal police to complain that the men had 
abducted the girl from her school bus 
tribal police got gila county sheriffs deputies to arrest allen 
and goodfield as they were returning to phoenix deputies 
confronted the civil rights official with drawn guns both men were 
released without charges after being held for several hours 
allen said he went to arizona to look into child custody matters 
involving indians goodfield a psychologist who works with the 
commission also had been advising normand and nadine desrocher in 
their efforts to retain custody of mrs altahas daughter 
last week the other seven members of the civil rights panel 
demanded that allen apologize for his actions on the reservation 
some commissioners also had called for his resignation saying 
he had embarrassed president bush allen in turn suggested the 
commission was an embarrassment to the president and suggested they 
all resign four of the eight commission members are appointed by 
the president and the other four by congress all serve staggered 
sixyear terms 
allen last week said he would not resign unless bush personally 
asked him to do so white house spokesman stephen hart said bush 
had no intention of asking allen to step down and would not have a 
vacancy to fill on the commission until november 
bush can appoint a new chairman from among commission members 
anytime he can get a majority of the commission to approve the 
appointment 
allen in his letter to tribal chairman reno johnson said he 
had already expressed deep regret for events of feb 7 after 
his false arrest 
i apologize to you again and i would repeat it tomorrow and 
the day after allen wrote adding i would insist however 
that wherever i err i do so in the honest fulfillment of my 
obligations to my country 
in an apology to the girls parents he said i came as a 
member of the commission on civil rights seeking information in a 
matter which in my judgment is of grave importance to the safety of 
the rights which you enjoy under the constitution 
i regret that my attempt to understand came at the cost of so 
much publicity and confusion to you and your family 
on friday tribal attorney claudeen bates arthur accused allen 
of having a racially discriminatory attitude about indian 
children and called for his resignation 
she said allen seemed to think it was all right to do this to 
an indian child on an indian reservation whereas you wouldnt find 
such conduct acceptable in middleclass white society

the bush administration is cautiously 
considering a proposal to seek discussions with the soviet union on 
a new political arrangement for eastern europe according to the 
new york times 
under the proposal moscow would loosen its hold on the region 
in exchange for a pledge by the united states and its nato allies 
not to exploit the new environment in a way threatening to the 
soviet union secretary of state james a baker iii said in an 
interview published tuesday 
the idea first broached by former secretary of state henry 
kissinger was being addressed as part of bakers overall strategic 
policy review which is to be completed by the beginning of may 
the times said 
i think it is worthy of consideration because it is a novel 
approach baker said during the interview at his state department 
office in washington 
i think it is important that any such idea to the extent that 
it is going to be pursued be pursued carefully so that you do not 
send a signal that somehow we are getting together with the soviet 
union and carving up eastern europe he added

encouraged by a loosening of the 
militarys hand and with help from neighboring iran islamic 
fundamentalists are gaining confidence and making political inroads 
in turkey 
the prosperity party a fundamentalist political organization 
won 10 percent of the vote in sundays nationwide local elections 
and captured more mayorships than premier turgut ozals motherland 
party 
prosperity barred from running in local elections five years 
ago won 75 percent of the vote in the 1987 general elections 
fundamentalism is an extremely delicate issue in turkey 
although overwhelmingly islamic the country has maintained a 
secular system decreed in the 1920s by kemal ataturk founder of 
the modern turkish republic 
while few see any danger of an islamic revolution such as swept 
iran concern has risen that religious extremists could disrupt 
turkeys plans of integrating with the west 
prosperity for example opposes turkeys membership in the 
north atlantic treaty organization and turkeys bid to join the 
european economic community it says that with eec membership we 
would lose our moslem identity in the sea of infidels 
turkeys powerful generals who have considered it their duty to 
defend the ataturk tradition cracked down on the fundamentalists 
after seizing power in a coup in 1980 
a new constitution drawn up before they handed back power to 
civilians in 1983 expressely bans islamic law or sharia which the 
fundamentalists had been demanding 
but during their rule of three years the military did nothing 
to stop the mushrooming of religious schools and the proselytizing 
by several fundamentalist sects the generals apparently wanted 
islam as an antidote to leftist ideologies that had spawned a wave 
of terrorism in the 1970s 
the issue of fundamentalism took a critical turn during the 
election campaign when the constitutional court forbade female 
students from wearing traditional moslem headcoverings on 
university campuses 
hundreds of students and their supporters staged demonstrations 
in turkeys major cities some of the protesters wore black 
headtotoe chadors 
premier ozal who combines devotion to islam with westward 
yearnings expressed sympathy with the students demands 
amid rumors that the military was growing increasingly 
impatient turkeys top general necip torumtay took the unusual 
step of declaring the armys loyalty to turkish democracy 
turkey has been angered by iranian protests over the court ban 
on headcoverings it has warned iran not to meddle in its internal 
affairs 
in retaliation iran has threatened to reduce its imports from 
turkey according to a report monday in the englishlanguage 
turkish daily news quoting unidentified treasury officials turkey 
has been hoping to get a share of reconstruction contracts in iran 
following that countrys ceasefire with iraq 
turkey also recently expressed displeasure over the spreading of 
iranian religious pamphlets by irans consul general in the city of 
erzurum in turkeys rural east near the iranian border 
in that area the prosperity party won about 20 percent of the 
vote in some cities 
the headcovering issue is being used as a springboard to an 
islamic revolution it wont remain there but will spring to other 
issues as well ahmet yucekok a political science professor and 
a leading authority on religion in turkey said in a recent 
interview with gunes newspaper 
there is provocation from iran iran is behind the 
fundamentalists as a state with money and agents but our social 
structure is very different from iran it is not easy here he 
said pointing to the far more pluralistic nature of turkish 
society 
islam has flourished under democracy more than during the 27 
years of single party rule after the establishment of the republic 
in 1923 politicians apparently have seen the need to campaign for 
the religious vote 
in the past decade there has been a sharp increase in the 
building of new mosques in mosque attendance and in the number of 
religious schools the majority of moslems in turkey are sunni as 
opposed to shiites in iran 
gencay saylan the author of a book on islamic revival 
attributed the strong showing by the prosperity party both to the 
furor over the headcovering controversy as well as general 
discontent with ozals motherland party 
some of that vote usually goes to the large conservative 
parties in general elections he said this election is a real 
breakthrough for them prosperity he said in a telephone 
interview

collapse 
creditors will start dismantling his ministry and oral

quivering with emotion 
people this is serious this is a lifeanddeath matter he

saying his life depended on raising 8 million to provide 
scholarships for medical school students at his college

in july 1977 when the first barrels of north 
slope crude made the 800mile journey down the transalaska 
pipeline to waiting oil tankers in valdez questions arose whether 
oil companies could clean up a major spill 
four months later concern was heightened when about 500 gallons 
of oil seeped from the tanker glacier bay into port valdez and 
state officials found the companys contingency and cleanup plans 
in a deplorable state 
lack of adequately trained crews and equipment were major 
problems 
if they couldnt effectively clean up something that small 
what are they going to do when there is a major spill said randy 
bayliss the state department of environmental conservations 
valdez supervisor at the time 
now state officials have the answer 
the 987foot exxon valdez ran aground friday just after filling 
its tanks at the alyeska pipeline service co terminal the 
tankers torn hull spilled more than 10 million gallons of oil 
about 25 miles south of valdez 
alyeskas plan for oil spills calls for cleanup equipment to get 
to a spill within five hours but it took the company several hours 
longer said dennis kelso alaskas environmental commissioner 
a barge to haul cleanup equipment was down for repairs making 
the response too late to make much headway on the quickly spreading 
oil 
the state agency dashed off a strongly worded letter to those 
overseeing the cleanup calling the response inadequate and 
slow and a failure of the contingency plan 
since pipeline operations began there have been more than 400 
oil spills in port valdez the vast majority under a barrel in 
volume 
two spills on the order of 1 million gallons occurred far 
offshore in the gulf of alaska a few years ago and in the summer 
of 1987 the glacier bay again sprang a leak when it ran aground in 
cook inlet dumping about 125000 gallons of oil just as salmon 
were set to move through the area 
in valdez the state the environmental protection agency and 
the coast guard jointly inspect alyeskas cleanup equipment and 
capabilities and they routinely conduct oil spill drills dumping 
hundreds of oranges into the water to simulate oil 
as recently as five years ago the dec and epa reported major 
concerns over alyeskas ability to respond to even a moderately 
sized spill 
a 1984 memo from valdez dec supervisor dan lawn to his superiors 
blasted alyeska for substantial cutbacks in personnel at the 
terminal including people to maintain and operate cleanup 
equipment 
the reliability of certain equipment is questioned especially 
in a major spill situation he said 
lawn also chastised the state for a lack of environmental 
officials to supervise the terminal 
unfortunately this has been a signal to alyeska that the 
state is no longer interested in the pipeline 
after a 1984 spill drill in port valdez the epa said equipment 
used by alyeska might not be suitable for oil spills in that area 
a spill drill in 1985 showed alyeskas inability to muster 
trained personnel and some equipment didnt work properly 
according to a dec report of the mock spill

the district of columbias chief ethics 
official has concluded that mayor marion barry violated a financial 
disclosure law by failing to report a real estate partnership a 
newspaper reported today 
the washington post quoted sources as saying that marianne 
coleman niles who directs the citys campaign finance office has 
determined that barry should be fined for failing to report the 
deal with developer jeffrey cohen 
the paper said ms niles has concluded that a promissory note 
the mayor signed in 1985 when he purchased an interest in a 
nantucket mass building amounts to an interestfree loan 
barry has recently been dogged by reports concerning the citys 
skyrocketing murder rate and controversy in december after he 
visited the district hotel room of a man charles lewis later 
charged with selling cocaine in the virgin islands barry has 
repeatedly denied using drugs or having any knowledge about any 
possible involvement with drugs by lewis 
the post said the mayors legal counsel herbert o reid sr 
did not say whether barry would agree to the sanctions and 
emphasized that the mayor did not knowingly violate any law 
district law requires top city officials to annually disclose 
any liability of more than 1000 that they owe to anyone other 
than a family member or financial or credit institution 
barry could face a maximum penalty of 1500 because he did not 
report the deal on his 1986 1987 or 1988 disclosure forms each 
violation is punishable by a 500 fine 
barrys share in the building is held under the name of investor 
israel kogan a local obstetrician kogan and barry hold an 
unregistered partnership called kb associates 
under the terms of the note the mayor is required to pay 
49000 over 10 years for a 10percent interest in the building 
the building valued at 1 million is owned by barry cohen and 
seven others 
when asked why his interest in the real estate deal was hidden 
barry said i was advised by my lawyers and accountants to 
handle it that way

president daniel ortega denounced the 
us government for deciding to give the contra rebels more 
nonlethal aid saying it should instead support regional leaders 
plan to dismantle rebel forces 
later monday the defense ministry said rebels attacked a 
military truck in the countrys north it reported two guerrillas 
and one soldier killed in the sunday attack in el jicote valley 
near the honduran border 
ortega speaking to 60 harvard scholars from 37 countries 
accused the united states of ignoring a central american peace plan 
that commits regional leaders to draft a program by midmay to 
demobilize contra forces 
speaking of the proposed us aid package the leftist 
sandinista leader said what theyre trying to do is maintain 
intact a force in honduran territory which is like a cannon aimed 
at nicaragua 
the president of honduras himself has insisted he has not 
agreed that the contras remain for another 10 months or a year 
he said 
ortega said the us decision to continue funding the contras 
reaffirms once again the policy that the strongest can act 
without regard for the will of others 
the nicaraguan rebels are based in honduras where the 
government though allied to washington has been increasingly 
trying to remove them 
the us proposal worked out between the bush administration 
and bipartisan congressional leaders and unveiled friday in 
washington would provide 45 million a month in nonmilitary aid 
to the contras 
the current 271 million in humanitarian aid runs out friday 
the new package proposes aid at least through november and could 
continue through february when ortega has promised to hold general 
elections 
the us government cut off military aid to the contras early 
last year 
if the us congress were respectful of our regional accord 
it would approve aid for 90 days and gear it to the dismantling of 
the contras ortega told the gathering of mason fellowship 
scholars who were in nicaragua on a oneday visit 
ortega moved up general elections in nicaragua by 10 months as 
part of the regional peace plan he and the presidents of el 
salvador honduras guatemala and costa rica reached in el salvador 
on feb 14 
the plan calls for dismantling the contras in return for greater 
democracy in nicaragua 
the presidents agreed to come up with a plan by midmay to 
demobilize up to 11000 contras living in honduran jungle camps 
near nicaragua with about 12000 relatives 
they have been battling the government for eight years but most 
fled to honduras after the contras and sandinistas signed a 
preliminary ceasefire agreement one year ago 
president oscar arias of costa rica told a news conference in 
san jose on monday that the proposed us aid package could help 
bring peace to the region arias won the 1987 nobel peace prize for 
a peace plan that called for amnesties and an end to civil wars in 
the region a plan that eventually evolved into the accords signed 
in february

capitalgains tax as well as a 03 percent transaction tax on stock 
purchases previously only a 055 percent transaction tax was

12 billion shares construction chemical and steel issues were 
particularly strong but share prices rose almost across the board 
manji ueda of nomura securities said japans recruit 
stockprofiteering scandal had held down the nikkeis performance 
but any further developments in the scandal were not likely to 
upset the market 
prosecutors today filed bribery charges against former vice 
labor minister takashi kato in the scandal that has rocked the 
government of prime minister noboru takeshita since last summer 
on monday prosecutors also brought bribery charges against 
hisashi shinto former chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone 
corp japans telecommunications giant they also charged hiromasa 
ezoe former chairman of recruit co the information conglomerate 
at the center of the scandal and his aide hiroshi kobayashi with 
having bribed shinto

higher at 13300 yen and ranged during the day between 13282 and

rise in new york dealers said 
news reports said traders in new york sold the yen and bought 
the dollar following a rumor that the stock scandal might lead to 
the arrest of former prime minister yasuhiro nakasone dealers said 
but such a rumor which ive heard many times already cannot 
be a dollarbuying incentive said takamasa yamasaki of daiwa 
bank even if nakasone is arrested and takeshita kicked out it 
would change nothing in the structure of the japanese economy and 
political system ruled by the liberal democratic party he said 
a comment by japanese finance minister tatsuo murayama today 
that the current yendollar exchange rate should be looked at 
with caution weakened the strong dollarbuying mood when the rate 
hit the 13220yen level other dealers said 
murayamas remark suggested the possibility of intervention by 
the bank of japan to halt the dollars rise against the yen but 
japanese market players expected the central bank would stay away 
from the market unless the rate hits 135 yen yamasaki said

peanut butter has proved its sticking power 
on youngsters palates and on shopping lists 99 years after it was 
first used as a health food for invalids 
peanut butter was invented by a st louis physician but his 
identity and details about his creation have been lost 
we dont know how it came about other than that he ground up 
peanuts to make a health food that they could consume said 
marilyne moore director of promotions and education for the 
georgia peanut commission 
the process was later patented by the kellogg family of battle 
creek mich and peanut butter became a common food item in mental 
institutions said don koehler the commissions executive director 
peanut butter has a tendency to stick to the palate so the 
doctors frail patients probably got a glass of milk to wash it 
down and further invigorate them ms moore said 
mom and apple pie and peanut butter are a way of life in 
america koehler said noting americans consumed about a billion 
pounds of peanut butter last year wed like to think that peanut 
butter may be pushing apple pie 
peanut butter is a highenergy food rich in protein b vitamins 
and minerals it has no cholesterol and contains 50 percent 
monounsaturated fats which can help reduce cholesterol in the 
body said ms moore 
the national appetite for peanuts continues to grow 
us residents each ate an average of 9 pounds of goobers last 
year which compared with 1987 included 119 percent more shelled 
peanuts 191 percent more peanut butter 99 percent more salted 
peanuts and 19 percent more peanut candy 
other peanut facts 65 percent of the us peanut crop is turned 
into peanut butter men prefer creamy peanut butter while women 
prefer crunchy and the creamy kind accounts for about 60 percent 
of peanut butter sales ms moore said 
the commission along with other grower groups that make up the 
new york citybased national peanut council sponsored the first 
annual convention of the 40000member adult peanut butter lovers 
club last year 
members include actor charlton heston rock star madonna 
columnist william f buckley and former president ford 
the meeting held at opryland in nashville tenn featured a 
peanut butter banquet and a peanut butter breakfast in bed 
club members she said got up and told why they love peanut

mccuddys tavern was built 79 years ago just in 
time to cool the throats of construction workers who were building 
a baseball palace for charles comiskeys chicago white sox 
on monday the scene was reversed the bar was destroyed to make 
room for a new ballpark 
it was a tearful occasion for jack blachley 12 who once sold 
hot dogs at mccuddys a baseball landmark and one of babe ruths 
favorite hangouts when he came to play the white sox 
as the greatgreat grandson of the taverns founder pulled the 
lever and about 40 mccuddy family members watched somberly 
speedway wrecking co took the first big chunk out of the small 
historic saloon that stood across the street from comiskey park 
young jack was too choked up to talk about it at first and hid 
his face as he said of the demolition its stupid 
but he later mustered up enough mischievousness to grab a piece 
of rubble and shatter the front window minutes before wreckers 
made their final assault on the white brick building 
the demolition of mccuddys was like a funeral family members 
said but in two years the tavern will be resurrected a block away 
right next to the new comiskey park 
artifacts from the tavern including the mahogany bar and 
hundreds of priceless photos from the inception of the team 
have all been placed in storage and will be used to duplicate the 
old taverns interior in the new bar mrs blachley said 
i feel very empty said puddy mccuddy senese jacks 
grandmother and grandaughter of john j mccuddy who opened the 
tavern in 1910 workers who built the ballpark that year used to 
down a few beers on breaks 
its a very hard thing it hurts said mrs senese the 
taverns current owner as she watched history turn into rubble 
when the late bill veeck owned the white sox he used to toss 
his wooden leg over a stool at mccuddys and shoot the bull for 
hours 
when the yankees were in town in the 1920s and 30s ruth would 
guzzle a few drinks at the tavern 
when the mccuddy family home was next door the sultan of swat 
would come over and have dinner with my greatgrandmother said 
sheri blachley mrs seneses daughter 
roast beef and homemade bread were babes favorite meals said 
mrs senese both women declined to reveal their ages 
the family home where both women grew up was knocked down 
along with many other homes as the state cleared the way for 
construction of the new ballpark which will sit on top of the old 
tavern site 
i didnt want to come to watch the demolition mrs blachley 
said my mother asked me to she put it this way its only 
going to happen once

barry minkow who conjured up a carpet 
cleaning company that cleaned investors out of more than 100 
million got the maximum sentence from a judge who said he wasnt 
buying the young entrepreneurs apologies 
before ordering a 25year prison term and restitution of 26 
million us district judge dickran tevrizian compared minkows 
newfound remorse to spreading toro poopoo across the court 
tevrizian issued the sentence monday for minkows dec 14 
conviction on 57 counts of securities credit card and mail fraud 
minkow 23 founder of the nowdefunct zzzz best carpet cleaning 
company used the sentencing hearing to tell the court how grateful 
he was that justice prevailed 
this is a great day for this country said minkow this is 
a great day for justice this is how america works 
he commended the fbi the securities and exchange commission and 
the us attorneys who prosecuted him saying they got the right 
guy they got the guilty guy 
defense attorney david kenner had asked for an eightyear 
sentence 
that would be a joke snapped the judge here is someone 
who has corrupted the financial system here is someone who has 
lied and cheated that sentence would be a slap on the wrist 
tevrizian further denounced minkow as a charismatic fraud and 
said his harsh sentence should serve as a warning to white collar 
criminals 
i have to make sure that he pays the price for what he has 
done he said expressing hope that his action would tell those 
who feed the bulls and bears of wall street that stock fraud will 
not be tolerated 
youre dangerous because you have this gift of gab this 
ability to communicate he told minkow you dont have a 
conscience 
tevrizian told minkow he didnt buy his late show of remorse or 
his newfound admiration for justice 
you tell me youre sorry and i think is he trying to clean 
my carpet or what 
the judge elicited laughter as he added i cant use the word 
to describe what youre trying to do to me perhaps the best way is 
to use my anglicized spanish and say el toro poopoo 
assistant us attorney james asperger said minkow would most 
likely serve only a third of any sentence imposed once released 
the judge said minkow would be placed on five years probation with 
the condition he pay back taxes any civil judgments against him 
the restitution and participate in a program for drug dependency 
the judge has already sentenced 10 other defendants in the case 
to terms of a month to eight years 
minkow who was 16 when he began zzzz best in his parents 
garage has insisted he was a captive of mobsters who took over the 
company and forced him to commit fraud 
the government said he was a shrewd con man who convinced wall 
street investors and tv talk show hosts that he was a teenage 
genius 
the collapse of zzzz best rocked volatile us money markets and 
exposed the vulnerability of major securities firms and banks 
which bought minkows sales pitch and committed millions to his 
company 
prosecutors said victims lost more than 100 million

despite strong protests from the seoul 
government a south korean dissident has met with north korean 
leader kim il sung to discuss reuniting the two countries 
according to reports today 
rev moon ikhwan had lunch monday with the communist leader in 
pyongyang and they discussed ways to end the division of the korean 
peninsula according to south koreas official naewoe press which 
reports on north korea 
moons visit has provoked a massive controversy in south korea 
government officials say he is serving north korean interests and 
attempting to subvert south korean policy 
his visit has fueled demands from government hardliners for a 
crackdown on south koreas dissident groups government prosecutors 
in seoul said monday that moon will be prosecuted for aiding the 
communist north if he returns home 
south koreans cannot visit the north without government 
permission 
kim il sung thanked moon for supporting his call for political 
negotiation talks on reuniting the two koreas naewoe said 
i express my all out support to the democratic figures from 
all walks of life in south korea fighting under difficult 
circumstances for selfreliant and democratic reunification kim 
was quoted as saying 
the north korean leader said he was determined to realize his 
plan of reuniting the two nations in a confederation under which 
they would retain control of their internal affairs 
moons secret visit came right after president roh taewoo 
ordered a major crackdown on dissidents and radical students he 
charged were trying to stage a leftist revolution roh cited the 
threat in justifying his decision march 20 to postpone indefinitely 
a promised referendum on his performance 
south korean dissident groups are calling for rohs overthrow 
but they have little support and are not seen as a major threat 
despite a recent spate of violent antigovernment protests 
police seized more than 3000 copies of pronorth korean books 
and arrested 11 publishers in raids monday night in seoul as part 
of rohs order to suppress leftist groups prosecutors said 
many ordinary south koreans were critical of moons visit 
charging the dissident leader was playing into the hands of the 
totalitarian north 
kim il sung ordered the north korean invasion in 1950 that 
started the bloody threeyear korean war kim rules what is widely 
regarded as one of the worlds most repressive police states 
north korea often claims the seoul government is a us backed 
military dictatorship with no public support and attempts to have 
independent contacts with dissidents to help liberate the south 
leading south korean newspapers charged in editorials today that 
the north was trying to undermine the seoul government by 
supporting dissidents to incite opposition and eventual revolution 
it is once again proven that north korea is sticking to its 
long standing policy of conquering the south through revolution 
said the conservative kyunghyang shinmun 
the two koreas have been holding talks on improving relations 
but have made little progress the seoul government says only it 
can handle contacts with the north 
the korean peninsula was divided by us and soviet forces that 
ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war ii separate 
countries were formed in 1948 and they have clashed repeatedly over 
the years

the bush administration is cautiously 
considering asking moscow to loosen its grip over eastern europe in 
exchange for a pledge from the west not to undermine the soviets 
according to a report published today 
the proposal is being considered as part of secretary of state 
james a baker iiis strategic policy review which is to be 
completed by the beginning of may baker said in an interview with 
the new york times 
i think it is important that any such idea to the extent that 
it is going to be pursued be pursued carefully so that you do not 
send a signal that somehow we are getting together with the soviet 
union and carving up eastern europe baker said 
the idea was first suggested by former secretary of state henry 
kissinger while george bush was running for president the times 
said 
kissinger reportedly suggested that washington and its nato 
allies consider calling on moscow to sharply ease its political and 
military control over eastern europe in exchange the west would 
promise not to exploit the new environment in a way that threatens 
the soviet union 
baker said the proposal had elements of great appeal but 
added that the west should not rush into such a plan because the 
counter argument also had appeal why strike a deal that would 
grant the soviets any type of formalized status in eastern europe 
when countries in the region like poland and hungary are already 
moving toward a more western orientation in their economies and 
political systems 
baker said that if progress did not continue in those countries 
if there was a reversal or if you had anarchy and a reaction by 
the soviets then it would be much more appropriate in my view 
to look at the possibilities of the proposal that henry advanced

life would be in danger if he is returned to north carolina where 
he has accused law enforcement authorities of corruption

since he has been acquitted of federal hostage charges for the same 
incident 
mondays hearing was to determine whether hatcher should be 
returned to north carolina on the federal charge or to drop the 
charge and begin extradition proceedings on the state charges in 
california

prosecutors arrested a second former government 
vice minister today in a widening stockprofiteering scandal that 
has shaken public confidence in prime minister noboru takeshitas 
administration 
the arrest of kunio takaishi 59 who retired last year as vice 
minister of education came the same day that formal charges were 
filed in the case against a former vice minister of labor takashi 
kato 
both men the highestranking public officials arrested in the 
scandal were accused of receiving bribes in the form of 
bargainpriced stock shares in exchange for using their influence 
in favor of recruit co an information conglomerate both retired 
before the scandal surfaced last summer 
opposition parties have demanded that takeshita resign and call 
new elections to allow for a public judgment of the recruit 
scandal which has raised questions about money links between 
business and government 
three members of takeshitas cabinet have stepped down as a 
result of the scandal but the prime minister has vowed to stay on 
and work for reforms to restore public trust in government recent 
public opinion polls have shown support for the takeshita 
government at only 126 percent 
takaishi is accused of helping recruit executives win 
appointments to government education committees 
recruits main business is publishing specialized magazines on 
job placement giving it a strong interest in both education and 
labor policy 
kato 59 who retired as a vice minister in september 1987 was 
arrested march 8 and accused of influencing a ministry decision not 
to impose stricter regulations on employment information magazines 
in 1984 
the latest arrest the 13th in the recruit scandal came a day 
after prosecutors filed formal charges accusing hisashi shinto 
former chairman of the telecommunications giant nippon telegraph 
and telephone corp of receiving bribes from recruit to help the 
company expand its telecommunications business 
prosecutors say kato was sold 3000 unlisted shares of recruits 
real estate subsidiary recruitcosmos co at a cutrate price in 
1986 he allegedly profited by about 45450 when public sales of 
the stock began and its price soared 
takaishi bought 10000 shares and sold 6000 immediately after 
the public listing for a profit of about 90000 prosecutors said 
in all about 700000 bargain shares in recruitcosmos 
reportedly were offered by the founder and former chairman of 
recruit ezoe hiromasa and his aides to more than 150 influential 
people 
today prosecutors added alleged bribery of kato to the charges 
already filed against ezoe and two aides masao tatsumi and 
toshihiro ono they also arrested ezoe again and another aide 
hiroshi kobayashi in connection with the takaishi case 
at least 17 leading politicians including takeshita and 
yasuhiro nakasone have been linked to the scandal nakasone was 
prime minister during the stock transactions however none have 
been arrested

the naacp has abandoned an 8yearold 
desegregation lawsuit against the nations secondlargest school 
district 
naacp attorney joseph duff said monday the group cannot afford 
to pursue the case and does not have enough time to assemble 
evidence to prove its allegations of racial inequities in the 
595000student school system 
i dont think theres any failure with the substance of the 
case duff said 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
remains convinced that local government with the acquiescence of 
the state established segregated neighborhoods and schools he 
said 
at the naacps request us district judge a wallace tashima 
on monday dropped the last defendants in the classaction lawsuit 
the state its education department and school superintendent the 
district was dropped in january 
duff argued that local government fostered segregation by 
concentrating public housing in black areas requiring children to 
attend schools in their neighborhoods and steering black teachers 
toward primarily black schools 
he said the state was at fault for failing to prevent such 
decisions 
deputy attorney general samuel overton said racial inequities 
were the result of private housing patterns rather than government 
activity 
there are certainly racially isolated schools but its 
not because somebody has made a conscious decision to make them 
that way not someone in government he said theres certainly 
private discrimination that takes place every day certainly in the 
housing market 
of the districts students 59 percent are hispanic 167 
percent black 158 percent white 59 percent asian 19 percent 
filipino and less than 1 percent are pacific islanders or native 
americans 
the naacp sued in 1981 two years after a state ballot measure 
overturned a courtimposed busing plan 
the group had sought new education programs for minorities more 
aid to minority schools with the lowest achievement records and 
smaller classes in minority schools 
since 1980 the state has given the district 1 billion toward 
mandatory and voluntary desegregation programs overton said the 
district still buses thousands of students a day in voluntary 
programs

new york city has all but banned pit bulls 
the board of health on monday adopted regulations barring any 
new pit bull terriers from being brought into the city after oct 1 
and requiring current owners to obtain hardtoget liability 
insurance of at least 100000 
all such dogs must be registered spayed or neutered identified 
by photographs and tattoos and muzzled and kept on a leash in 
public in addition owners of pit bulls must post warning signs at 
home 
only lloyds of london offers such insurance policies and it 
charges 3000 said aspca spokesman jeffrey hon 
no insurance company will give coverage for any price 
said mordecai siegel president of the society of new york dog 
trainers anyone with a pit bull will be forced to give it up 
unregistered pit bulls could be seized and their owners fined up 
to 500 a day said health department spokesman barry adkins 
pit bull terriers were bred long ago to battle bulls for sport 
they have been known to attack people without warning or 
provocation 
after october 1 adkins said there will be no pit bulls 
allowed into new york city this will lead to the grandfathering 
out of all pit bulls eventually there will come a time when there 
will be no pit bulls in new york city 
adkins said that by rigorously controlling pit bulls the law 
seeks to prevent serious bites by these animals before they occur 
thereby protecting the public health 
he guessed pit bulls would be gone from the city in 12 to 16 
years 
city health commissioner dr stephen joseph said in january that 
while pit bulls are estimated to account for only 2 percent of the 
total city dog population they are responsible for close to 14 
percent of all reported bites

up a military committee to revamp their strategy in the battle for 
afghanistans eastern city of jalalabad 
the move came after an afghan government official said monday 
the threeweek guerrilla attack around jalalabad was collapsing and 
the rest of the country was quiet 
there has been terrible coordination in jalalabad 
acknowledged a guerrilla source today speaking on condition of 
anonomity 
he said the guerrillas strength lies in harassment not 
launching a conventional attack on an urban center to return the 
jalalabad fight to a hitandrun battle he said would be a 
better strategy 
western diplomats who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
today reported a lull in battle for control of jalalabad a 
guerrilla victory would give the insurgents control of their first 
major city and provide a base for the interim government they 
elected feb 23 in pakistan 
the diplomats said the fighting had dropped off because the 
usbacked insurgents are trying to coordinate their military 
strategy 
however the insurgents are also moving more supplies toward the 
battlefront and trying to negotiate the surrender of government 
troops diplomats said 
casualty reports in the fight for jalalabad have varied widely 
official government sources put the guerrilla death count at more 
than 4000 guerrillas and western sources said about 300 
insurgents have died and another 900 have been injured 
mohammad nabi amani the foreign ministry spokesman in the 
afghan capital of kabul said 190 guerrillas were killed between 
sunday night and monday night he said two government soldiers and 
three civilians also died 
amani said guerrillas fired 250 rockets and shells at jalalabad 
during that time compared with 12000 in the previous 24 hours 
were of the opinion that they are drawing a conclusion that 
they cannot achieve any success through military means he said 
of the guerrillas 
in islamabad pakistan a guerrilla group claimed 53 soldiers 
were killed and five aircraft shot down in weekend fighting around 
jalalabad 
the guerrillas launched their offensive on jalalabad march 6 at 
its peak the fighting was said to be the heaviest in the

fivemonthold christy andrews one of 
the tiniest infants ever to survive premature delivery is ready to 
come home from the hospital five times heavier than at birth but 
still only 5 pounds 
at birth christy weighed 15 ounces and measured 10 inches so 
small that neonatologists at our lady of lourdes medical center in 
camden rated her chance of survival at less than 5 percent 
according to the courierpost of cherry hill 
she finally fits into her preemie clothes shes a nice size 
now shes a cuddly size said leslie andrews 28 who gave birth 
to christy 3 months prematurely in october 
the baby who was to come home today has about an 80 percent 
chance of growing up to be a normal child said dr margaret 
fernandes dsouza director of the hospitals neonatal intensive 
care unit 
she should catch up and at the age of 3 should be like any 
3yearold but a baby who starts off so small usually tends to be 
a small child and adult the doctor said 
as christy prepared to go home with her family her father 
edward 31 her sister michelle 8 and her mother mrs andrews 
shouldered the 15pound portable oxygen tank that she probably will 
be carrying for the next year

the fate of an 84 billion highway and 
masstransit program for the phoenix area rested today with the 
voters who were asked to add a halfpenny to their sales tax to 
pay for the project 
turnout of 30 percent to 35 percent of maricopa countys 860000 
eligible voters was predicted in the oneissue special election 
maricopa county includes phoenix glendale scottsdale tempe 
mesa and chandler the sales tax varies from city to city the rate 
in phoenix is 67 percent 
recent polls indicated that the public was about evenly split on 
the program which calls for a 103mile elevated railway an 
increase in the number of buses to 1500 from 350 operation of a 
commuter train linking suburban chandler mesa and tempe with 
phoenix and accelerated freeway construction 
the metropolitan area of 2 million people is the nations 
largest without an integrated freeway system and county residents 
have some of the highest auto insurance rates partly because of 
accidents 
most of the controversy has focused on whether trains and added 
buses would attract enough riders to justify the expense and reduce 
air pollution and traffic 
neighborhood preservationists and taxdolllar watchers have 
lined up against the increase politicans and others predicting 
huge population growth support it cost estimates range from 84 
billion to 104 billion by the year 2019

a small group of people lit candles in 
the dark outside the three mile island power plant at 4 am today 
the moment the nations worst commercial nuclear accident began 10 
years ago 
it was an accident that changed the world as people knew it 
said organizer gene stilp a harrisburg attorney seven others 
stood by him 
in the distance the two 350foot concrete cooling towers of the 
undamaged unit 1 reactor silently puffed white steam 
it was not the last nuclear accident were out here to 
remind people of that stilp said the vigil ended about two 
hours later 
about 150 people marched outside the plant monday residents 
nearby said they are still angry about the accident and that they 
bear physical and emotional scars 
the socalled accident at tmi was an act of violence against 
mankind an act of violence against the unborn said jane lee 
who lives near the plant in etters about 10 miles southeast of 
harrisburg 
the accident began march 28 1979 when a series of human and 
mechanical errors allowed the plants 150ton radioactive core to 
lose cooling water half the core melted and 20 tons of molten 
material raced to the bottom of the reactor before it was held in 
check by a remaining pool of water radioactive gas was released 
into the atmosphere over several days 
ms lee scoffed at how the federal and state governments 
responded to the accident and their followup health studies that 
found no evidence of accidentrelated illnesses 
theyre lying she said why is it such a big dark 
secret it must be covered up for national security with those 
kinds of friends i dont need any enemies 
gordon tomb a spokesman for gpu nuclear corp the utility 
subsidiary that operates the plant now said extra people had been 
assigned to the main gate this morning the demonstration was 
peaceful 
asked about the anniversary tomb said were inclined to take 
the opportunity to note the lessons from the unit 2 accident and 
remind ourselves of the importance of remembering those lessons 
officials of general public utilities corp the plant owner 
have said in the past few weeks that the company has made great 
strides since the accident and learned from the mistakes that were 
made 
since 1985 when tmi unit 1 returned to operation they said the 
company has shown it has the integrity and capability to safely run 
a nuclear power plant 
the plant owner still faces about 2000 damage claims 
deborah baker of middletown who won a 1 million settlement 
from the plant owners insurance company said her own research has 
convinced her the accident caused her son to be born nine months 
after the accident with downs syndrome 
if i can touch one person today with my message then i feel i 
have accomplished my goal she said for us the accident will 
always be in our memories 
ernest sternglass a professor of radiation physics at the 
university of pittsburgh and a critic of government health studies 
said radiation from the accident boosted infant mortality in 
pennsylvania new york and maryland and caused thousands of other 
deaths by lowering peoples immunity 
he said government officials manipulated mortality data to hide 
the damage and called for a congressional investigation into what 
he called a scandal here of incredible proportion 
thats patently absurd replied faith schottenfeld a 
spokeswoman for the new york department of health 
his allegations are not new said george tokuhata research 
director for the pennsylvania health department they are 
absolutely untrue its ridiculous we dont have an ax to grind 
were trying to report what we find 
harvey wasserman who wrote a book killing our own about 
the health effects of nuclear power said the nuclear industry has 
not made all the plant improvements ordered after the accident he 
said only a shutdown of nuclear power would be a fitting memorial 
this marks a decade of false denials and outright lies on the 
part of the utility that owns and operates three mile island 
and on the part of the state of pennsylvania which has 
systemically obfuscated and hidden any real statistics about the 
deaths that have occurred in the wake of the accident at tmi he 
said 
bob newlin spokesman for the nuclear regulatory commission 
said tmi requirements are pending at 88 of the nations 112 nuclear 
plants but he said almost 96 percent of the 10514 postaccident 
modifications have been completed including most of the 
significant safety items 
in hanover nh the chairman of the presidential commission 
that investigated the accident said he was pleased by the 
industrys progress of the past decade 
im not saying that every problem has been fixed john 
kemeny said but he said it was very hard for me to believe that 
its the same industry we really tore apart 10 years ago

soviet voters offered their first real choice in 
70 years spurned many communist party and government leaders in a 
stunning rejection of the status quo election returns showed today 
moscows mayor its no 2 communist party leader five regional 
party chairmen in the ukraine and communist party chiefs in 
leningrad and kiev were all rejected sunday in elections for the 
new congress of peoples deputies 
asked if the results indicated a loss of confidence in the 
communist party foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov 
said today maybe they were wrong for their posts maybe they 
failed to advertise their platforms 
as far as party members are concerned about 20 percent of 
party members lost 80 percent won he said 
the voters rejection of top local officials for the national 
parliament did not sweep them from their jobs in the party or 
government apparatus however it could weaken their power base and 
eventually lead to their replacement 
gerasimov said local party organizations would examine the cases 
of officials who lost their races and decide their futures 
voters appeared to be expressing dissatisfaction with the 
inefficiency and mismanagement associated with an entrenched party 
elite that many see as resisting president mikhail s gorbachevs 
efforts to reform soviet society to end chronic food shortages and 
improve the quality of life 
the 1500 winners in sundays vote and in subsequent runoffs 
will join those chosen earlier by the party and other officially 
sanctioned organizations in the 2250seat congress which is 
certain to be dominated by the communists 
still many indepedent voices are expected to make a lively body 
of the congress which will meet once a year to choose a standing 
legislature and the countrys president 
final figures were not available on voter turnout but figures 
from individual cities indicated it was high the communist party 
paper pravda said 89 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the 
southern city of krasnodar and 903 percent voted in the ukrainian 
city of kharkov 
officials at the central election commission in moscow said yuri 
solovyev a candidate member of the ruling politburo and regional 
party chief in leningrad was defeated in the election even though 
he was unopposed enough voters crossed solovyevs name off the 
ballots to deny him the required majority and force a runoff 
election officials said two full politburo members ukrainian 
party leader vladimir v shcherbitsky and russian republic 
president vitaly i vorotnikov won seats without opposition as 
did the premier of the russian republic alexander v vlasov 
vlasov is a candidate politburo member 
city officials in voronezh where vorotnikov was a candidate 
said he received 84 percent of the more than 2 million votes cast

vacation after the resounding success of his antiestablishment 
candidacy for moscows sole atlarge seat in the new congress 
yeltsin received 894 percent of the vote in moscow a city he 
ran as communist party chief until he was sacked in november 1987 
for criticizing the partys style of leadership and warning of a 
stalinlike cult developing around gorbachev 
voters did not get a chance to voice their opinion of yeltsins 
replacement as moscow party boss politburo member lev n zaikov 
like gorbachev and most other politburo members he took one of the 
100 seats alloted to the communist party in the new congress 
but two other top moscow officials mayor valery saikin and 
communist party second secretary yuri prokofiev faced voters 
sunday and were denied seats in the congress 
saikin received 425 percent of the vote while his opponent 
received 248 percent the newspaper moskovskaya pravda reported a 
new election will be held 
prokofiev received only 135 percent of the vote in his 
district the winner was vladimir markov director of a radio 
communications institute the newspaper said 
tass reported leningrad party leader anatoly gerasimov received 
only 15 percent of the vote in a contest with a shipbuilder 
the official news agency said the regional communist party 
leaders in kiev voroshilovograd the carpathian region lvov and

east germany gen boris snetkov voters in a district east of 
moscow favored another military officer lt col viktor podzeruk 
by 18 million votes to 871000 for snetkov local journalists

space shuttle atlantis next month 
will carry out the nations first interplanetary launch in 12 years 
when it sends the magellan probe toward venus to map the planet 
surface with supersharp radar 
i believe that we are looking at a rejuvenation if you will 
of the planetary space program that is very important that has 
been in the doldrums for a while due to budgetary concerns and of 
course recently to a lack of launches atlantis commander dave 
walker said monday at a news conference with his four crewmates 
shuttle missions were grounded for nearly three years in the 
wake of the challenger explosion which killed its seven astronauts 
jan 28 1986 
walker said the upcoming atlantis flight is a logical marriage 
between the manned and unmanned space programs 
magellan will be the nations first interplanetary launch in 12 
years and the first from a shuttle noted astronaut ronald grabe 
who will pilot atlantis 
so magellan will be a very fulfilling flight for us not only 
when we launch it but 15 months later when it orbits venus he 
said 
the shuttle is scheduled to begin its fourday mission april 28 
deployment of magellan the crews primary goal is scheduled to 
occur about six hours after blastoff from cape canaveral fla 
after magellan is released from the cargo bay a payload motor will 
start the 8000pound probe on a 466day voyage to venus 
magellan is to reach its destination on aug 10 1990 swooping 
into orbit around venus to begin a 243day period during which it 
is to map the entire surface of the planet with highresolution 
radar 
venus is our closest neighbor in terms of space mass and 
size said astronaut norm thagard planetary science is very 
important to learning how the earth evolved and what is going on 
here we worry about the greenhouse effect here on earth 
magellan could tell us if there are any parallels between earth and 
venus 
mary cleave a mission specialist on atlantis said the radar 
images could also show whether venus has shifting crustal plates 
similar to those that sometimes cause earthquakes 
because there is no water on venus the radar can look at the 
entire planet and this might help us understand plate tectonics on 
earth she said 
earth and venus were almost identical at the beginning of the 
solar system some 46 billion years ago today venus is shrouded 
in a cloud of gases and its surface temperature is 900 degrees

the supreme court today made it easier for 
those who win partial victories in civil rights lawsuits to recover 
their attorneys fees 
the court in a case involving texas school teachers ruled 
unanimously that those who prevail on a significant issue in 
such suits are entitled to reimbursement for legal fees even if 
they lose the central issue 
the court ruled in favor of teachers in the garland independent 
school district who challenged antiunion regulations imposed by 
school officials 
the regulations barred teacher union representatives from 
visiting schools during regular school hours or using school public 
address systems or other communications facilities 
the rules also prohibited private conversations among teachers 
regarding the employee organizations and also barred any teacher 
from using a schools internal mail system or bulletin board 
facilities 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the regulations 
affecting union representatives but the appeals court said it 
violates freespeech and freeassociation rights of teachers to ban 
private conversations or prevent them from using the mail or 
bulletin board facilities 
the appeals court also ruled that the texas state teachers 
association and the garland education association which filed the 
suit are not entitled to be reimbursed for attorneys fees 
federal civil rights law provides that the prevailing party 
in such cases is entitled to reimbursement from the losing side 
the idea is to give an incentive to lawyers to represent civil 
rights plaintiffs who may lack the financial resources to hire 
lawyers 
justice sandra day oconnor in her opinion for the high court 
today said the teachers are entitled to reimbursement even though 
they lost the central issue of the case 
she said under federal law a prevailing party must be one who 
has succeeded on any significant claim affording it some of the 
relief sought 
otherwise oconnor said there would have to be 
excruciating inquiries by federal judges to determine the 
intent of lawsuits 
the search for the central and tangential issues in the 
lawsuit or for the primary as opposed to the secondary relief 
sought much like the search for the golden fleece distracts 
judges from the primary purposes of the civil rights law she 
said 
the case is texas state teachers association vs garland 
independent school district 871759

the rugged wilderness that makes prince 
william sound a rich marine habitat stands as a barrier to efforts 
to rescue the thousands of animals expected to be fouled by 
americas biggest oil spill officials say 
theres just a lot of problems out there said pam bergman 
head of the regional response team for the us department of the 
interior 
problems cited by bergman and others include 
a coastline so remote that rescuers are afraid to send out 
volunteers for fear they might not be prepared for wilderness 
survival 
beaches so rugged that in many places it is impossible to land 
a boat let alone chase down and capture oilcoated birds or 
wildlife 
distances to aid facilities so great that animals captured on 
the beach would probably die in captivity waiting to be taken to a 
hospital 
wild animals so large and powerful that rescuers could be 
seriously injured 
a body count of dead animals is about all anyone can hope to 
accomplish said jon lyman alaska department of fish and game 
spokesman that count stood at fewer than 100 birds late monday 
but thousands more are expected to die 
bergman said environmental groups have begun organizing to help 
but she has asked the volunteers not to come to valdez there is no 
place to stay no boats to take people out no equipment and 
nothing to do she said 
officials in the state of washington estimated that 10000 birds 
died there after a barge spilled 231000 gallons of bunker oil off 
the coast last year bunker oil is thicker than the north slope 
crude that spilled in prince william sound but the washington 
spill was only about onefiftieth the size of the spill near valdez 
in washington rescuers were able to mobilize thousands of 
volunteers who could easily get to the scene 
in alaska strong winds monday and tuesday pushed the oil 
farther from the rescue coordination center at valdez beyond the 
reach of wouldbe animal rescuers and made it impossible to 
retrieve oilsoaked wildlife bergman said 
bergman said there is no place to put a rescue facility any 
closer to the advance of the oil slick which covers more than 100 
square miles there are no communities in the southwest portion of 
the sound an area of rocky reefs and treestudded islands 
a lot of the beaches are too small she said and catching birds 
from boats is out for safety reasons 
its real hard to sneak up on birds she said you end 
up racing the birds down the beach with a net trying to catch them 
once you capture an oiled bird you cant leave it in a box for 12 
hours 
contaminated birds must go almost immediately to a 
rehabilitation center to be fed deoiled and dried 
sea otters present even bigger problems she added they look 
sweet and cuddly and wonderful but they got sharp teeth and 
claws bergman said

a privately owned rocket 
ship carrying experiments on weightlessness will blast off on a 
15minute mission wednesday the nations first licensed commercial 
space flight 
the flight of consort i owned by space services inc of 
washington marks another stage in the private space research 
efforts that gained in significance after the 1986 challenger 
tragedy 
this launch you can probably trace to the challenger disaster 
because these experiments were hoped to be carried aboard the 
challenger or future shuttles said walter pennino an investor 
and spokesman for space services 
the company launched the first privately financed space shot 
conestoga i with a dummy payload in 1982 since then the federal 
government has begun licensing private launches and consort i is 
the first to get the green light 
conestoga i proved private industry could launch spacecraft and 
also showed that the government was unprepared for the new 
industry pennino said 
there was no single agency we or anyone else could go to and 
ask if we could do this pennino said adding his firm had to 
consult with the federal aviation administration federal 
communications commission and defense department among other 
agencies 
the department of transportation was assigned the task of 
licensing private launches and coordinating with different 
agencies consort i received its license from the departments new 
office of commercial space transportation 
consort is 650pound payload will include experiments that will 
measure how liquids mix in weightlessness how plastic foam forms 
and cures how liquids coat glass surfaces how epoxy reacts in 
weightlessness and how finely powdered metals bond under high 
temperature to produce alloys without melting 
the experiments have applications in the manufacture of 
medicines alloys and ball bearings and in the construction of 
future space stations 
the payload was assembled by the university of 
alabamahuntsvilles consortium for materials development in space 
one of 16 nasasponsored consortiums for the commercial development 
of space 
consort i will be boosted into space by a modified terrier navy 
rocket the second stage is a black brant rocket the entire 
vehicle stands about 52 feet and weighs 6000 pounds at liftoff 
the rocket will achieve a top speed of 5016 mph and in a 
little less than five minutes will rise 198 miles above earth it 
will land about 50 miles north of the launch site 
the entire venture should cost about 2 million including the 
cost of reimbursing white sands for the use of its time and 
personnel pennino said

federal criminal defendants who fail to 
persuade a judge to throw out their indictments because of alleged 
misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are tried and 
convicted the supreme court said today 
the unanimous ruling is a defeat for a buffalo ny 
contracting firm and its president both charged with rigging bids 
in selling liquid bituminous coal to the state and some western 
counties 
the justices upheld the 2nd us circuit court of appeals 
refusal to hear arguments by midland asphalt corp and albert c 
litteer that grand jury abuses by prosecutors tainted the 
indictment 
writing for the court justice antonin scalia said federal court 
rules bar criminal defendants once a judge dismisses such 
allegations in pretrial proceedings from appealing immediately to 
a federal appeals court 
scalia said midland and litteer indicted in early 1987 must 
wait until after a trial is conducted and pursue their 
prosecutorialmisconduct arguments if they are convicted 
the decision resolves conflicting rulings between the new york 
citybased 2nd circuit court and the san franciscobased 9th us 
circuit court of appeals 
the 9th circuit court had ruled that dismissals of such 
allegations are immediately appealable 
lawyers for midland and liteer contend that prosecutors violated 
federal rules by disclosing details of a grand jury investigation 
to the public 
they said the information was released in connection with a 
separate civil case 
the case is midland asphalt vs us 871905

the head of israels police ordered policemen 
not to put press signs on their cars while searching for 
palestinians suspects unless they have his permission a day after 
saying the practice was to continue 
journalists plans to put police on duty signs in their own 
cars were canceled after the agreement with police 
inspectorgeneral david krauss 
the decision came after an appeal from jerusalems journalists 
association which said the officers use of press signs could 
endanger reporters traveling in the occupied territories and arab 
east jerusalem to cover the palestinian uprising 
palestinian youths routinely stone cars with yellow israeli 
license plates but are more likely to let journalists pass 
peacefully arabowned cars in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip have blue or white license plates 
members of the journalists association met today with krauss to 
ask him to forbid the decoy method even though the police chief 
said monday the signs were not illegal and that police were to 
continue using them 
krauss responded today with a statement saying he will instruct 
police units to refrain from impersonating journalists unless they 
have his permission 
any request by police figures to make use of such means will 
be subject to the approval of the inspector general the 
statement said 
i am satisfied said elisha shpigelman chairman of the 
journalists association after his meeting with krauss i 
certainly see this as an acceptance though not fully of our 
position 
on thursday several western news agencies and an israeli 
photographer filmed jerusalem police driving a rented car with a 
handwritten sign saying tv and arresting a 15yearold arab 
girl for throwing stones 
israeli journalists and the foreign press association condemned 
the ruse but krauss defended the practice as legal 
the policemen did not disguise themselves as journalists he 
said in a television interview they camouflaged their vehicle in 
one of the possible camouflage ways 
the police have very difficult and very important duties in 
the field including arresting stonethrowers and firebombers on the 
spot without harming them and i think thats preferable krauss 
said 
shaked said on israeli radio that the practice endangers freedom 
of the press another journalist leader gabi brun said the 
journalists union planned to distribute signs saying police on 
duty for reporters cars 
meanwhile an organization of jewish settlers in the west bank 
said it plans to distribute thousands of press signs to 
settlers in the area 
if reporters are stoned as a result maybe theyll understand 
the distress of the settlers the committee for secure roads said 
in a statement 
about 70000 settlers live among the 17 million palestinians in

the white house has told president bushs 
legal counsel to keep internal policy disputes inside the 
administration and off the front pages of newspapers 
straying from a course set by bush c boyden gray had publicly 
challenged a new agreement with congress on central america 
arguing that it dilutes the constitutional powers of the president 
it is highly unusual for an official serving at the pleasure of 
the president to publicly criticize a policy the president has 
endorsed but thats just what gray did 
theres a lot of discussion of this and a feeling that it was 
really a somewhat bizarre occurrence and shouldnt have happened 
said one senior white house official the general rule of thumb 
for senior white house aides is that theyre not supposed to be on 
the front pages of the newspapers particularly not raising 
concerns about the presidents policies 
the official who declined to be identified says gray was 
backing off on his challenge 
another white house official also speaking anonymously said 
gray was told dumb move but move on to other subjects its 
not as if everybodys wringing their hands over this 
asked today for his reaction to grays comments bush said 
no but i shared my reaction with boyden thats how i handle 
things 
bush on monday also sidestepped whether he was mad at gray for 
putting a critical spotlight on the first major plank of the 
administrations emerging foreign policy 
on a day like this im not angry at anybody bush said at 
the annual easter egg roll on the south lawn surrounded by 
thousands of youngsters 
white house officials made clear however that they thought 
gray had blundered 
i cant tell you what was in boyden grays mind said press 
secretary marlin fitzwater thats more than i can handle 
fitzwater said white house chief of staff john sununu dealt with 
gray they had a polite discussion about how things work in the 
white house fitzwater said 
fitzwater said he was not aware if gray had been told to work 
within administration channels instead of complaining to the press 
however fitzwater said i think thats a good idea id tell him 
that 
it was the second time in two months that gray had shed the 
traditional anonymity of the counsels position to pose a challenge 
to secretary of state james a baker iii the chief architect of 
the central america accord and one of the most powerful figures in 
the administration 
earlier gray had questioned the propriety of baker holding 
stocks in a new york bank with outstanding third world loans baker 
denied any impropriety but sold the stocks fitzwater said he was 
not aware of any problem between gray and baker 
gray ignited the latest controversy by telling the new york 
times that the agreement bush announced friday with congress allows 
lawmakers to encroach too far on the constitutional powers of the 
president to conduct foreign affairs 
the accord provides 45 million a month in nonlethal aid for 
the contra rebels in nicaragua a side letter stipulates that the 
money will not continue after november without the approval of four 
key congressional committees 
gray complained that he had not had a chance to review details 
contained in the side letter moreover he said he had reservations 
about the pact 
brushing aside grays objections fitzwater said the agreement 
had been reviewed by bush baker sununu national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and two legal counselors at the state department 
fitzwater said they didnt feel it needed further staff review 
their conclusion was and our conclusion is that the 
presidents powers were enhanced by this agreement there was no 
abrogation of authority and that this is an agreement that brings 
to conclusion years of dissension between the executive and the 
legislative branch brings to a halt many of the practices of the 
congress dealing directly in foreign policy which was a threat to 
presidential authority fitzwater said 
so our feeling is this is very helpful in this regard 
gray has refused to comment since sunday when baker discussed 
the dispute on a television news program

states may not tax federal pensions while 
exempting the pensions of retired state and local government 
workers the supreme court ruled today 
by an 81 vote the justices struck down michigans differing 
tax treatment of the pensions received by retired government 
employees 
the challenged michigan law violates principles of 
intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local 
government employees over retired federal employees justice 
anthony m kennedy wrote for the court 
he said paul s davis an east lansing lawyer is entitled to a 
refund of 4299 on taxes he paid from 1979 through 1984 
davis worked for the federal government at various times in his 
career retiring in 1980 
he challenged the michigan law that allows federal retirees 
living in the state to deduct only up to 7500 of their annual 
federal pensions when computing their state tax liability 
the law permits retired employees of the state government and 
local governments within michigan to deduct all their state 
pensions from their state taxes 
the michigan court of appeals had upheld the law but that 
ruling was reversed today 
kennedy said the law violates a federal law that authorizes 
states to tax federal employees if the taxation does not 
discriminate against the employee because of the source of the 
pay or compensation 
the justices rejected arguments by michigan authorities that the 
law applies only to federal employees and not to federal 
pensioners 
under the michigan law federal pensioners faced the same state 
tax liabiity as private industry retirees while state and local 
government pensioners do not 
the court said the inequity among government workers may not 
continue but the justices left it up to michigan courts to decide 
whether the proper remedy would be exempting all federal pensions 
from state taxes or exposing the pensions of state and local 
government retirees to some state taxation 
according to the national association of retired federal 
employees at least five other states give special preferences to 
state or local government retirees not afforded to federal retirees 
those states are arizona arkansas georgia new york and 
virginia 
justice john paul stevens was the lone dissenter i cannot 
join the unjustified courtimposed restriction on a states power 
to administer its own affairs he wrote 
in other action the court 
made it easier for those who win partial victories in civil 
rights lawsuits to recover their attorneys fees 
the court in a case involving texas school teachers ruled 
unanimously that those who prevail on a significant issue in 
such suits are entitled to reimbursement for legal fees even if 
they lose the central issue 
ruled that federal criminal defendants who fail to persuade a 
judge to throw out their indictments because of alleged misconduct 
by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are tried and convicted 
the unanimous ruling is a defeat for a buffalo ny 
contracting firm and its president both charged with rigging bids 
in selling liquid biruminous coal to the state and some western 
counties 
the pension case is davis vs michigan department of treasury

police fired on hundreds of ethnic 
albanian protesters in kosovo province today killing at least one 
person and wounding 14 in rioting against serbias bid to gain 
more control over the region authorities said 
serbias parliament today formally adopted constitutional 
changes to increase authority over government and schools in 
kosovo the republics autonomous southern province bordering 
albania 
six straight days of protests since kosovos parliament approved 
the changes have left 21 people dead and scores injured 
authorities said it is kosovos worst violence since 1981 when 
nine people died in ethnic riots and the province was briefly 
placed under martial law 
the ethnic albanians who make up 85 percent of kosovos 19 
million citizens say the constitutional changes will curb the 
broad autonomy they won under the 1974 yugoslav constitution 
serbia says the changes are needed to protect the provinces 
slav minority which alleges constant harassment from the ethnic 
albanians 
the federal interior ministry in a statement issued in the 
capital belgrade said extra police forces from throughout the 
country were being dispatched to kosovo 
the ministry in the statement published by the official tanjug 
news agency said two policemen were shot dead monday and 25 police 
were injured five seriously in the two days of unrest nineteen 
demonstrators lost their lives and 49 were injured the ministry 
said adding that police were not responsible for all the deaths 
maria gasi a spokeswoman for kosovos information secretariat 
told a news conference told foreign correspondents at a news 
conference that a dusktodawn curfew in effect since monday would 
apply to them she told foreign photographers they would no longer 
be allowed to shoot pictures in kosovo 
authorities on monday also banned gatherings of more than three 
people schools the university cinemas theaters and sports 
stadiums were closed indefinitely 
police in djakovice used tear gas and other technical means 
today against a crowd of several hundred chanting rockthrowing 
youths tanjug said 
todays death and injuries came in a fierce clash in zur a 
village neaer the albanian border and more violence was reported 
from orohovac where about 250 stonethrowing ethnic albanians were 
said to have smashed windows 
tanjug said an 18yearold youth died in zur when police opened 
fire after shots came from a rockthrowing crowd of about 500 the 
crowd wrecked two police vehicles the agency said 
ms gasi reported major incidents today in zur and the towns of 
prizren djakovice dusanovo and orahovac 
tanjug said tear gas was fired to disperse crowds in orahovac 
djakovice and dusanovo where it reported an unspecified number of 
injuries tear gas also was used in decani it said 
security was tight in pristina the provincial capital 160 
miles south of belgrade with dozens of military vehicles visible 
and frequent patrols by riot police some wearing bulletproof 
jackets 
sonic booms were heard as military jets flew low overhead a 
tactic that was used in pristina last september to try and 
discourage unrest 
tanjug said mondays riots appeared well prepared and 
coordinated 
there have been allegations that ethnic albanians in kosovo are 
part of an underground separatist movement that wants to join with 
neighboring communist albania 
the continuation of violence despite mondays clampdown and 
dozens of arrests after a partial state of emegency was declared in 
kosovo last month indicated the strength of ethnic albanian anger 
over the constitutional changes 
tanjug reported celebrations in factories and schools in several 
serbian towns today after the parliament formally approved the 
changes 
a rally was scheduled later in belgrade to celebrate the passage 
of the constitutional reforms which give serbia more control over 
the judiciary schools and police in its provinces of kosovo and 
vojvodina 
the serbian drive for more control over kosovo has produced 
nationwide divisions in the communist leadership of this 
nonaligned and ethnically diverse country

president bush today dispatched three senior 
federal officials to alaskas oilpolluted prince william sound to 
take a hard look at where this disaster stands and said there 
are conflicting reports on whether exxons cleanup of the massive 
spill is sufficient 
a federal takeover of the cleanup operation is one option that 
will be considered the president told reporters at an oval office 
meeting with transportation secretary samuel skinner environmental 
protection agency administrator bill reilly and coast guard 
commandant paul yost 
bush said he would asked the three to go up to alaska to take 
a hard look at where this disaster stands they were leaving 
immediately after the white house 
i think its important these top officials federal officials 
go there and then they will report to me after theyve had a chance 
to assess the situation on the ground the president said 
bush said the spillage of 11 million gallons of oil from the 
tanker exxon valdez the largest oil spill in us history was a 
matter of tremendous concern to alaskans and to all of us 
asked whether exxon which is overseeing the cleanup effort was 
doing enough and if he was satisfied with the pace of the effort 
he said 
theyre certainly making a good beginning here but there are 
some conflicting reports on that i dont want to prejudge that i 
think one of the things that were interested in hearing is exactly 
how our top officials feel the cleanup is going 
a federal takeover of the operation is an option bush said 
and then the question is is that the most prudent way to go and 
thats one of the recommendations ill be awaiting 
both bush and skinner hinted that exxon might face big civil 
penalties 
there are a variety of legal options that are available but 
now the primary consideration is to make sure everything possible 
is being done skinner said 
and the president has directed us to assess that that oil is 
being contained and that the oil that remains on the tanker is 
being offloaded as quick as possible that is our primary objective 
as mandated by the president well then later on worry about who 
is going to pay for the damage 
bush said the thing is to get it cleaned up to protect the 
very precious environment out there to make sure everything is 
being done to clean up this disaster and then well have all these 
penalties and all that later on 
bush said he still supports a proposal to open a pristine arctic 
wildlife refuge to oil drilling faces more intense scrutiny after 
the spill of millions of gallons of oil into environmentally 
sensitive waters off the alaska coast 
theres no connection between that and the oil spill he 
said 
bush has endorsed what he calls environmentally prudent oil 
exploration in the arctic national wildlife refuge an expanse of 
wilderness that is home to caribou polar bears and a variety of 
waterfowl in the northeastern reaches of alaska 
but some members of congress which must approve opening the 
refuge for drilling said monday the oil tanker spill in alaskas 
prince william sound the worst such spill in us history 
raises questions about whether environmental safeguards can be 
assured 
its too early to tell whether the controversy over the spill 
will dash the oil industrys hopes for quick passage this year of 
legislation allowing drilling in the refuge such a bill earlier 
this month cleared the senate energy and natural resources 
committee 
the american petroleum institute the oil companies washington 
lobbying group called the spill very regrettable and said 
simply we cannot tell what impact it might have on pending 
petroleum industry issues here in washington 
at a news conference today 11 major environmental groups 
blasted the oil industry for breaking promises of assuring that 
environmental accidents such as the spill in alaska would not 
occur or if they happen would be quickly cleaned up 
the great accident they said wouldnt happen has now 
happened said michael mccloskey chairman of the sierra club 
brock evans of the national audubon society said weve had 
enough of oil industry promises they cant be kept 
other speakers from the environmental movement ridiculed 
suggestions that the exxon valdez tanker spill is an isolated 
accident they cited other tanker spills in recent years although 
of a much lesser magnitude still harmful to the environment 
the term environmentally safe oil development is a 
contradiction said lisa spear of the natural resources defense 
council 
sen max baucus dmont chairman of the senate environmental 
protection subcommittee said monday the spill is the latest and 
most tragic evidence of the gap that exists between past industry 
assurances and actual industry performance in preventing 
environmental damage 
another member of the environmental panel sen joseph 
lieberman dconn suggested that the spill and the problems 
containing it graphically refute those who maintain that the oil 
industry in alaska does not harm the environment 
meanwhile a house interior subcommittee with jurisdiction over 
alaska oil drilling plans hearings into the spill and its 
significance for opening the alaska refuge to oil exploration 
obviously the tanker spill and the inadequacy of the cleanup 
effort could have serious implications for the expansion of north 
slope oil development said rep george miller dcalif 
chairman of the interior subcommittee on water power and offshore 
energy resources 
oil companies and the environmental movement have been facing 
off over exploratory drilling in the alaska wildlife refuge for 
several years since preliminary indications raised the prospect of 
finding more than 3 billion barrels of crude under the regions 
tundra 
bills opening the refuge for drilling are under consideration in 
both the house and senate legislation also has been introduced to 
declare the refuge a formal wilderness area which would prohibit 
oil or gas development 
the oil industry wants exploratory drilling along a 15 
millionacre coastal stretch of the refuge which also is the 
breeding ground for north americas largest remaining herd of 
migratory caribou and the habitat for polar bears musk oxen 
wolves arctic foxes and an assortment of waterfowl

outside an american cultural center in islamabad and another person 
died in two other bombings at british council libraries outside the 
capital 
howe met briefly with representatives of the pakistanbased 
afghan guerrillas who are fighting afghanistans sovietsupported 
communist leaders 
but he said there was no question of diplomatic recognition he 
said britain recognizes only states and never governments

while the attorney generals men were out at 
lunch oliver north scooped up documents in the irancontra affair 
that he had missed the night before and walked them to a shredder 
norths former deputy testified today 
marine lt col robert earl told the jury in norths trial that 
the lunchtime document sweep occurred on nov 22 1986 the day 
after north had announced to earl that it was time for ollie to 
be the scapegoat in the iran arms initiative 
earl said william bradford reynolds and john richardson two 
aides to thenattorney general edwin meese iii had come into the 
national security council office that saturday morning the day 
after massive document destruction by north caused the office 
shredder to break 
at norths request earl had turned over his own records on the 
secret arms initiative to iran which included a document showing 
how the iranians had been overcharged for the weapons they had 
purchased 
some of the overcharges were funneled to the nicaraguan contra 
rebels while much of the remainder wound up in private bank 
accounts controlled by arms dealers richard secord and albert 
hakim who are awaiting trial in the irancontra affair 
during a morning of reviewing documents at norths office 
reynolds iscovered the diversion memo outlining a plan to channel 
proceeds from the iran arms sale to the contras evidence of a 
diversion raised the possibility that crimes had been committed 
north stepped off the elevator down the hall from his office as 
reynolds and richardson left for lunch and the three men spoke 
briefly earl testified 
while reynolds and richardson were at lunch north began 
collecting documents earl testified i believed that those were 
documents that should have been sabotaged the previous day but 
werent he said 
earl said north then went outside through an alleyway and headed 
for a shredder in the white house situation room where national 
security crises are monitored 
it was your understanding that those papers would never been 
seen again prosecutor david zornow asked 
yes sir earl replied 
meese and his aides had launched with approval from president 
reagan a factfinding inquiry into the iran arms sales in an 
attempt to develop a complete account of what happened 
the prosecution closes out its case this week with testimony 
from meese and two of his exaides they will testify about norths 
alleged lies in connection with the diversion of iran arms sale 
money to the contras 
meese now with the heritage foundation a conservative 
washington think tank will testify about norths alleged 
statements that the nsc wasnt involved in the diversion 
north is accused of falsely telling meese that the israelis 
determined how much would be diverted to the contras and that north 
had advised a contra leader to open bank accounts in switzerland to 
receive money from israel the alleged false statements were made 
at a nov 23 1986 meeting with meese and his aides including 
charles cooper and john richardson who both are scheduled to 
testify 
meeses weekend factfinding mission in november 1986 that 
uncovered the channeling of iran arms sale money to the contras was 
criticized later as inadequate by congressional investigating 
committees 
the inquiry started as an effort to gather information on the 
secret iran arms sales during it a meese aide discovered a memo 
by north outlining a plan to divert money from the iran weapons 
sales to the contras two days later meese announced that there 
would be a criminal investigation 
meese said he never asked cia director william casey about the 
diversion and waited two days to speak to norths superior 
national security adviser john poindexter 
when he did meese said he didnt ask poindexter whether he had 
told the president about the diversion of iran arms sale proceeds 
to the contras 
after north admitted to meese there had been a diversion the 
nsc aide went back to his office and shredded documents until early 
the next morning 
meese waited too long to seal norths offices and these 
lapses placed a cloud over the attorney generals investigation 
congress concluded

would not be the successor of iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini tehran radio reported 
the broadcast said montazeri told khomeini in a letter that he 
was not ready to be khomeinis successor 
khomeini thanked montazeri for the decision according to the 
broadcast monitored in nicosia it quoted khomeini as saying that 
even when montazeri was designated as his successor by the council 
of experts he had opposed the choice 
the move came amid signs of a major shakeup in the iranian 
foreign ministry it closely followed the resignations of mohammad 
jaafar mahallati irans ambassador to the united nations and 
javad larijani an assistant foreign minister for european and 
american affairs 
mahallati resigned from his post today tehran radio said 
irans official islamic republic news agency reported larijanis 
resignation on sunday 
montazeri declared last month that iranian leaders made many 
mistakes in the first 10 years of the islamic revolution isolating 
the republic from much of the world he also said the revolution 
had failed in its policies and promises 
questioning the 8year war with iraq has been anathema in iran 
but montazeri also has dared to ask did we succeed in doing will 
during the imposed war or did the enemies who imposed it turn out 
to be the victors 
although khomeini did not mention montazeri by name last week 
he proclaimed how shortsighted are those who thing that because 
we did not reach final victory at the front that martyrdom and 
selfsacrifice are worthless 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati were the chief movers behind the drive to soften 
irans radical image following the aug 20 ceasefire in the 
persian gulf war 
but khomeini claiming iran had drifted away from the values of 
its 1979 revolution said last week that the government must do 
its best to govern the people as best it can but this does not 
mean that it should drive them away from the great goals of the 
revolution which is the creation of a global islamic government 
khomeini also said recently as long as i am alive i shall 
never let the state fall into the hands of the liberals

a federal safety investigator looking into the 
deadliest accident in us history attributed to drunken driving 
said today that school buses should have to meet more stringent 
emergency evacuation standards 
bernard s loeb investigator for the national transportation 
safety board testified as the board considered recommendations and 
conclusions it will make in the headon collision between a pickup 
truck and a churchoperated school bus that killed 24 children and 
three adults near carrollton ky on may 14 1988 
loeb told the fivemember board that standards for evacuation 
from public transit buses exceed the federal standards for 
schooltype buses he said performancerelated standards are needed 
rather than those which only require certain widths between benches 
and set dimensions for exits 
i dont care how they do it but theyve got to be able to 
evacuate that bus in a shorter period of time loeb said 
ntsb staff members based on interviews with many of the 40 
children and adults who escaped the fiery crash described children 
crawling over each other to get out of the bus after it was hit by 
a pickup truck driven by larry mahoney 34 of worthville ky 
ntsb investigator john v moulden testified that mahoney could 
have had up to a 029 blood alcohol level which is nearly three 
times the legal level for presumption of intoxication and 
twothirds of the way to a lethal dose 
mahoney who faces a nov 8 trial date on 27 murder charges was 
driving the wrong way on interstate 71 when his truck collided with 
the bus the crash blocked the front door and sent flames and smoke 
through the bus which was returning from a church outing at an 
amusement park 
moulden said mahoney likely drank about a full case 24 cans 
of light beer on the day of the crash which occurred at 1055 pm 
he in no way could be judge competent to operate a vehicle the 
investigator said 
investigators said mahoney 35 had been arrested in 1984 on 
drunkendriving charges they said he had been twice divorced and 
was planning to remarry his first wife 
about an hour before the crash friends took away his keys 
because they thought he would lose his drivers license but gave 
them back when he told them he was only driving a short distance on 
a dirt road to the trailer where he lived said jean fassone who 
headed the onsite investigation

the government said today it withheld 
parts of a report on the assassination of prime minister indira 
gandhi because they contained top secret material 
home minister buta singh told reporters the government did not 
release certain passages of the report because they were classified 
or considered sensitive press trust of india reported 
the agency quoted singh as saying the speaker of parliament will 
be given the full report and will be able to seek the attorney 
generals opinion on whether the secret portions should be made 
public 
the report released monday and based on the findings of a 
special state commission accuses an adviser to prime minister 
rajiv gandhi of complicity in the 1984 shooting death of mrs 
gandhi the adviser rajendra kumar dhawan was personal secretary 
to mrs gandhi at the time 
the government said dhawan had been exonerated of involvement in 
mrs gandhis death 
opposition members said today the government failed to release 
two volumes of the report 
is the parliament at the mercy of the government asked 
opposition leader madhu dandavate a janata party member of the 
lower house 
dandavate presented a motion for breach of privilege a form of 
parliamentary sanction against singh who delivered the report to 
parliament 
in the upper house opposition members wrested an assurance from 
deputy chairman najma heptulla that the issue would be taken up 
with the government 
the statesman newspaper reported the report had four volumes and 
was about 8000 pages long the government released 657 pages in 
two volumes 
the report links three people directly to the assassination the 
two gunmen and dhawan mrs gandhis personal secretary for more 
than 20 years 
mrs gandhi was slain by two sikh bodyguards on oct 31 1984 
as she walked through the garden of her new delhi residence to a 
television interview 
one of the two sikh assassins was killed by other bodyguards 
just after the assassination the other was sentenced to death and 
hanged along with a third sikh kehar singh who was convicted for 
instigating the assassins to commit the crime 
the report accuses dhawan of facilitating the crime by reversing 
an order to remove all sikhs from mrs gandhis inner security 
circle as well as changing the shift of one of the assassins and 
the time of the television interview 
it says dhawan lied or gave inadequate reponses to questions 
about entries in his diary about one assassin foreign money the 
cia and his association with a sikh suspected of having ties to the 
us intelligence agency 
it said mrs gandhi had looked into replacing dhawan and had 
reprimanded him a month before she was killed it did not say why 
he was reprimanded 
in releasing the report to parliament the home minister said a 
special investigating team had unraveled a conspiracy a larger 
conspiracy to eliminate mrs gandhi he said more charges are to 
be filed but gave no details 
according to the report the commission accepted that mrs 
gandhi was killed by her bodyguards however it did not rule out 
involvement of a foreign power 
the government says mrs gandhi was killed in revenge for an 
army raid she ordered in june 1984 on the golden temple to clear 
the sikhs holiest shrine of militants at least 1200 people died 
most of them sikhs 
india has long accused pakistan of training and arming sikh 
militants pakistan has denied the charge 
dhawan 52 left his post after mrs gandhis death but 
returned to the government last month as an adviser to her son 
dhawan could not be reached at his home or office for comment on 
the report

customs officers on tuesday seized a petition 
signed by 24000 chinese abroad that called for the release of 
political prisoners in china according a priest who tried to carry 
it into the country 
the seizure occurred a day before the 10th anniversary of the 
arrest of dissident wei jingsheng who is serving a 15year 
sentence for counterrevolutionary crimes 
lau chin shek a roman catholic priest from hong kong said he 
had planned to present the petition to the national peoples 
congress chinas legislature now meeting in beijing 
under chinese law chinese residing in the mainland macao and 
hong kong have the right to present petitions to the congress 
lau said most of the signatures were from hong kong residents 
chinese students studying in the united states canada and western 
europe also participated he said 
the petition comes as a growing number of intellectuals in china 
are calling for an amnesty for political prisoners since january 
intellectuals here have written four open letters urging an amnesty 
and democratic change so far about 200 people have signed 
lau was part of a group of seven hong kong intellectuals 
including doctors journalists and clergy which had traveled to 
beijing to present the petition 
we made it but the petition didnt lau said 
the group also asked chinese authorities to let them visit wei 
who was one of the leaders of the democracy wall movement before he 
was arrested on march 29 1979 for calling for democracy amnesty 
international a londonbased human rights group has adopted him 
as a prisoner of conscience unverified reports say wei who was 
sentenced in 1979 is not well 
lau and the group flew from hong kong to tianjin a city near 
beijing on the coast of the bohai sea on tuesday as they 
proceeded through customs chinese officials searched their bags 
they found the petition and told us they were going to study 
it before returning it lau said they kept us in the airport 
for three hours finally they said we could go but they still had 
to study the petition 
lau said the petition was similar to the recent open letters 
it was very simple he said we called for the release of 
political prisoners we believe that this goal is one that will 
benefit not just china but the whole world 
lau said he was upset at the seizure and accused china of 
infringing on his rights 
this is a basic right guaranteed in the chinese 
constitution he said hong kong a british colony since the 19th 
century returns to china in 1997 both hong kong and macao a 
portuguese trading post since the 16th century that returns to 
chinese rule in 1999 have begun sending delegates to the national 
peoples congress 
in recent weeks china has condemned the petition drives and 
sought to discredit them as invitations for foreign pressure on 
beijing 
chinese delegates to the congress and to the chinese peoples 
political consultative conference a major government advisory 
group which closed monday have said they expected a call for 
political amnesty to be raised at both meetings so far no call has 
been raised and the congress closes next week

sports officials from south korea and 
north korea made progress tuesday on forming a joint team for the 
1990 asian games and expressed optimism on reaching an overall 
agreement 
delegates agreed after about three hours of talks to meet again 
april 18 at the panmunjom truce site to clear the way for forming a 
joint national team such a development could be a big step in 
easing tension on the divided korean peninsula 
the north seemed to be sincere about the talks i can say 
we made some progress today said chief south korean delegate 
chang chungshik 
chief north korean delegate kim huong jin said the talks must 
help the two sides improve relations and end their rivalry 
what is most important is for both to get rid of the 
concept of confrontation and think first of all that they are 
members of one nation sharing the same destiny kim said in an 
opening statement 
the talks must still overcome major obstacles before they can 
form a joint team to send to the games in beijing past efforts 
failed on such issues as the name of the team and what flag it 
should use 
both sides agreed a team would be selected after joint training 
of candidates south korea had wanted selection before training 
north korea offered a concession on the name of the team and 
both sides offered suggestions on a team flag both critical 
issues they agreed march 9 that a traditional korean folk song 
would serve as the team anthem 
the nations have been holding intermittent talks at various 
levels to try to improve relations both sides say they want to end 
their long bitter rivalry 
separate talks between parliamentary delegations and senior 
government officials were stalemated by north korean demands last 
month that seoul call off annual team spirit military exercises 
with us forces 
south korea refused and the exercises involving 200000 south 
korean and us troops concluded last week 
pyongyang proposed the sports talks in december saying the two 
sides should stop fielding separate teams at international sports 
events 
north korea boycotted the summer olympics in seoul last year 
after south korea and the international olympic committee refused 
to let pyongyang be a cohost north kora also boycotted the 1986 
asian games in seoul 
the two nations have been enemies since the division of the 
korean peninsula by us and soviet forces in 1945 at the end of 
world war ii north korea invaded south korea in 1950 to start the 
threeyear korean war 
the korean border is sealed and the two sides have hundreds of 
thousands of troops facing each other along their 150mile border

greece said tuesday it again wont take 
part in natos annual dragon hammer military exercise april 
20may 2 because of a continuing dispute over an island in the 
aegean sea 
government spokesman sotiris kostopoulos said greece was not 
participating because the exercise would violate a treaty 
concerning the military status of the northern aegean island of 
lemnos 
greece claims that international treaties allow it to garrison 
the island while neighboring turkey a member of the north 
atlantic treaty alliance says greece has no such right 
greece which keeps a large military presence on the island 
refuses to take part in nato exercises unless lemnos is included in 
the war games turkey strongly objects to the fortification of 
lemnos located near its aegean coast 
although greekturkish relations have improved recently the two 
still are at odds over control of aegean airspace its seabed and 
mineral rights 
greece has not taken part in any nato exercises held in the 
aegean since premier andreas papandreous socialist government came 
to power in 1981 parts of dragon hammer are to take part in 
the aegean

the aspirations of the young pole in the 
crowd outside the us embassy werent grandiose i would like to 
work and live a normal life 
but they speak volumes in a country where little is normal 
other than spiritsapping shortages of everything from housing to 
hope 
so he and hundreds of thousands of others worldwide have taken a 
chance on finding a place in what they see as a land of plenty 
they have entered a us state department lottery to win one of 
20000 immigration visas to the united states to be issued over two 
years starting in october 
a computer will select the winners rather than the immigration 
officers who normally must strictly limit visas to those who have 
specialized skills or a close relative in the united states 
this lottery may be their only chance of immigrating said 
phyllis villegoureixritoud consulgeneral of the us embassy in 
warsaw 
many poles learned about the program from voice of america 
broadcasts as my ringing phones can testify said embassy 
second secretary sylvie martinez we havent had a moments peace 
since 
rules for the lottery are quite specific the applications are 
mailed directly to washington a difficult prospect to start with 
in many parts of the world the deadline is friday 
each person can send only one application it must by 
typewritten contain specific information and photographs and be 
mailed in an envelope no larger than 9 by 4 inches and no smaller 
than 6 by 3 inches 
the people who would really benefit from a visa wont be able 
to make the application complained a rome spokesman for the 
private intergovernmental committee for migration which is 
supported by countries including the united states what 
assurance do they have that it will arrive on time 
in impoverished bangladesh a business started overnight to sell 
applications and envelopes following the prescribed form an 
envelope sold for about 31 cents five times normal and the same 
price was charged to get the address typed 
in peru a mail strike that started feb 2 has complicated 
matters with many people much too poor to afford a private courier 
nonetheless the applications have been streaming toward 
washington state department spokeswoman frances jones said 
hundreds of thousands are expected although they wont be counted 
until the deadline a more restrictive lottery program for 10000 
visas in 1986 generated 14 million applications 
bangladesh authorities report 500000 immigration applications 
were sent during the first 15 days of march with the number 
expected to swell to a million the postal service has opened 
special counters and added hours 
on line at one post office was jalaluddin sikder a prayer 
leader at a mosque at savar near dhaka who said its a lottery 
there is no harm to try my luck allah will help me 
golam mostafa a 30yearold elementary school teacher applied 
because i have no future here i heard that the states is a rich 
country and i will be able to lead a good life there 
many applicants seemed philosophical about the daunting odds 
polishborn bozena trela who learned of the lottery from a 
translated embassy bulletin posted in a rome hotel housing polish 
refugees sees it as another small chance of getting to america 
im not very hopeful i will win but maybe if im lucky 
said trela 30 if she gets to america she hopes to earn enough 
not just to exist but to live 
the random selection by computer worries her though because 
it is a risk to let people into america without knowing their 
background 
i am university educated with work experience but how will 
they know that she said 
some who might qualify through customary immigration channels 
also are applying for the lottery hoping to reduce waits that can 
add up to a decade or more for siblings of us citizens in 
poland 3500 immigrant visas and 70000 temporary visas were 
issued last year from more than 110000 applications 
lottery applications also are coming from among the estimated 
17000 soviet jews in italy waiting to enter the united states 
they must also apply for this program because they no longer 
are having much luck with refugee status because those quotas have 
been filled said jim wagner of the tolstoy foundation for soviet 
refugees in rome 
a romanian mechanical engineer who defected and now must wait 
for a us visa at the traiskirchen refugee camp south of vienna 
said he learned about the lottery in a friends letter from the 
united states 
if i am lucky in the lottery i may leave early next year if 
not ill have to waste more time here which i hate because i am 
not allowed to find a job and i am bored stiff doing nothing he 
said 
in thailand where 40000 information sheets on the program have 
been passed out saranpat anumutrachakit a 24yearold who wants 
to study in the united states sees the lottery as taking a chance 
you know it is like the thai lottery you may win or you may 
lose she said

the postal service has decided to follow a 
trend in business technology by offering facsimile machine service 
on an experimental basis 
the fax machines have blossomed across the nation in the 
last few years speeding copies of documents from business to 
business for people too impatient to wait for even messengers to 
make the trip 
the experiment is expected to start in june at 260 post offices 
across the country postal officials said bids are being let for 
the machines to be used 
the plan is for the machines to be in post office lobbies 
available to either send or receive fascimiles of documents 
payment will be by credit card mastercard visa or american 
express to cover the service and phone costs the rates have not 
been determined 
the machines are expected to be designed to store received 
documents for a period of time so that customers do not have to be 
on hand at the moment they arrive customers will punch a code into 
the machine to obtain their particular document officials said

officials differed today 
on whether hundreds of women and children inside a prison seized by 
rebellious convicts are hostages or supporters of the uprising 
government negotiators held a second day of talks with leaders 
of the rebellion that began sunday when friends and relatives of 
inmates were visiting the prison 
the roman catholic priest who is chaplain of guatemalan prisons 
said he considered most of the more than 600 visitors still inside 
pavon penitentiary virtual hostages 
though some are there by choice the rebellious prisoners know 
that they the family members are their protection they know that 
once they are gone the armed forces could try to retake the 
facility the rev antonio lopez martin said before entering the 
prison 
authorities said at least four guards and three inmates were 
killed and 20 people wounded as prisoners seized about 75 m1 
rifles and tried to escape sunday 
about 1000 soldiers and police joined the prisons 180 guards 
outside the 25 squaremile facility where inmates were demanding 
better food and reduced sentences 
prison spokesman conrado monroy told reporters friends and 
relatives fear that if they leave authorities will take 
reprisals against the rebel inmates 
the inspectorgeneral of the national prisons system carlos 
ramos moncada said he believes the visitors are not hostages 
they remain there by choice he said the family members 
still inside are backing the movement 
ramos moncada said 607 people besides the up to 100 rebellious 
inmates remained inside the prison 
officials said the visitors on sunday included more than 150 
children 360 women and 100 men 
esmirla cheti 19 walked out today with her nephew edgar 13 
she said they were visiting a friend when the uprising occurred and 
she remained voluntarily for two days 
but we were also afraid about what might happen if we tried to 
leave she said we were going to leave last night but they 
the prisoners told us to wait until morning 
she said some people have food in the prison but other people 
were going hungry 
president vinicio cerezo ordered prison and other authorities 
to exhaust every alternative in negotiating a solution 
ramos moncada said monday night that serious problems remain 
in resolving the standoff the rebels must reform their conduct 
and surrender the weapons 
he said six people who were hostages four doctors and two 
firefighters were released at midday monday he said the rest of 
the people inside the prison were considered to be supporting the 
uprising 
on monday night inmates escorted 15 adults and four children 
out of the prison 
ramos moncada said the rebellious prisoners had about 75 m1 
rifles taken from prison guard dormitories 
he said their demands for better food and reduced sentences 
had not changed since sunday and that they did not demand a plane 
to fly to cuba as reported by a local radio station 
the roughly 1250 prisoners who did not take part in the 
uprising apparently remained in areas of the prison outside the 
rebels control 
clementina diaz and her 2yearold son miguel angel were among 
those who left the prison monday night 
mrs diaz who was visiting her eldest son gerardo on sunday 
said she left because her little boy had a fever she said inmates

the us drug enforcement agency 
loaned three aircraft to paraguay to help eradicate marijuana 
fields in the northeast of the country officials said tuesday 
our decision is to spray these plantations as soon as they are 
identified by the aircraft said inspector inocencio montiel of 
the paraguayan narcotics department 
ten us pilots mechanics and support personnel will accompany 
the two thrush spray planes and a cessna caravan 
the loan stems from a 1987 agreement under which the united 
states pledged to supply paraguay with 200000 in training and 
equipment to combat drug trafficking 
in 1987 the us state department estimated there were 7400 
acres of paraguayan marijuana plantations 
an increase in marijuana cultivation in paraguay in the past two 
years has been attributed to aggressive eradication efforts in 
neighboring brazil and bolivia

albania sent its first official delegation to 
china since the two former communist allies parted company more 
than a decade ago the official xinhua news agency said tuesday 
the delegation led by deputy foreign minister muhamet kapllani 
and foreign trade first deputy minister kostandin hoxha arrived in 
beijing on tuesday for a fiveday visit xinhua said 
albania was one of chinas last loyal friends in the communist 
camp after mao tsetung split with the soviets in 1960 and veered 
sharply to the left during the 196676 cultural revolution 
however relations cooled with the rise to power in the late 
1970s of deng xiaoping a pragmatist who has transformed china with 
his experiments in marketoriented economic reforms 
the report said the albanians will hold talks with officials 
from the foreign ministry and from the ministry of foreign economic 
relations and trade 
albania one of the worlds most closed nations has showed 
signs recently of opening to both the west and its former communist 
allies

the city council has tentatively voted to give 
ground to both opponents and backers of denvers livinginsin 
zoning ordinance 
the council voted 85 monday night to give tentative approval to 
amendments in zoning measures that were adopted in the 1960s to 
discourage hippie communes by barring unrelated people from living 
together in some parts of town 
council members then postponed any further vote april 24 
the exact number of residents affected by the zoning rules was 
not immediately known denver has a population of 505000 
as many as 53 percent of the residences in denver are in an r1 
zone where a homeowner must obtain a 20 boarders permit to cover 
a nonrelative the amendments would drop the permit requirement 
but would bar nieces nephews aunts uncles and inlaws from 
moving in said city councilwoman cathy donohue 
donohue who voted for the amendments counted that as a setback 
to opponents of livinginsin restrictions since 1956 you 
have been allowed to have all these relatives in your home she 
said 
a more restrictive code called r0 and applying to 7 percent of 
denver residences bans boarders or unrelated people from living in 
the same house the amendments would allow two unrelated adults to 
live together but no more 
the penalty for violating the citys ordinance is 999 a day in 
practice donohue said people just move 
the city zoning office keeps no count of boarder permits issued 
and the city attorneys office said it has no figures on people who 
have challenged the law or paid the fine 
among those affected are three nuns who are being forced to move 
out of a fourbedroom home 
they wanted all but one of us to move out said one of the 
nuns who asked that her name not be used to me its wasteful 
to have just one person living in a dwelling with four bedrooms 
its very sinful 
five years ago five people challenged r0 zoning in state 
supreme court and lost said jennifer macy administrative 
assistant to the city council

the air force has temporarily grounded its 
fleet of b1b bombers in a precautionary move following an incident 
monday in which an internal fuel tank on one of the bombers was 
punctured the pentagon said today 
the incident occurred at dyess air force base texas during a 
routine preflight check before a b1b training flight said dan 
howard the pentagons chief spokesman 
the fuel tank appears to have been punctured when the mechanism 
that sweeps the bombers wings back and forth malfunctioned he 
said 
the spokesman disclosing the grounding during a regular 
pentagon news briefing said the bombers crew was sweeping the 
wings forward and backward before takeoff and discovered the wings 
were not moving evenly together 
it was noted that they were out of sync howard said 
the third time that they swept the wings forward a clunking 
noise was heard they shut down the aircraft and they observed the 
fuel leak theyre currently conducting an investigation to see 
what caused the problem 
howard said it appeared the left wing in being swept to a full 
forward position exceeded its normal limits and subsequently 
fuel was noticed in the wing root area 
the strategic air command has suspended training flights on its 
b1b aircraft until further notice howard said 
the spokesman said there was no current indication that the 
incident was related to a nov 8 1988 crash of a b1b bomber at 
dyess or any other previous incident 
the november crash has been blamed on a wing fire the precise 
cause of which remains unknown 
the air force has lost three of its 100 b1b bombers to crashes 
besides the nov 8 crash one was lost in 1987 when it ran into 
pelicans on a lowlevel training flight and the third was lost 
last nov 17 during a landing attempt at ellsworth air force base 
sd 
howard said the grounding order affected only training flights 
and was not being applied to the b1bs currently standing nuclear 
alert 
the b1bs alert status is not affected by this standdown and 
the aircraft remains capable of meeting its wartime 
requirements he said

president bush said today he is still seeking 
clarifications on an arrangement with japan for joint production of 
the fsx fighter plane 
what i want to know is that the agreement is clear theres no 
point in having an unclear agreement we have a lot at stake 
here bush told reporters 
the president also said the two sides were continuing to talk 
and he does not know whether a friday deadline set by japan in 
accordance with requirements of its fiscal calendar would be met 
japanese ambassador nobuo matsunaga met with deputy secretary of 
state lawrence eagleburger the first official meeting between the 
sides since a negotiating session last thursday 
but state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the fsx 
fighter was discussed only briefly because the meeting was a 
courtesy call planned before the controversy arose 
bush said last week that he endorsed the pact for joint 
manufacture of the fsx fighter which was concluded by the reagan 
administration but wanted some changes to protect us technology 
administration sources said the holdup now is over nailing down 
who owns the technology that derives from the fsx project and what 
percentage of the fighter should be built in the united states 
under the agreement signed late last year st louisbased 
general dynamics would join with japans mitsubishi heavy 
industries to codevelop and coproduce the fsx as an advanced 
version of the us f16 fighter 
proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the 
united states could negotiate in the face of japanese opposition to 
buying f16s directly from this country they say the deal will 
promote exchanges of technology while helping us industry 
critics contend the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of 
advanced technology that japan may use to help propel its civilian 
aircraft industry into competition with the united states in the 
world market they say tokyo should purchase americanmade planes 
to help offset the 50 billion us trade deficit with japan

a judge today disqualified the san diego yacht 
club as the winner of last septembers americas cup challenge and 
awarded the international trophy to a new zealand club 
state supreme court justice carmen ciparick said the san diego 
club violated the spirit of the 101yearold deed of the gift 
which sets out the rules for the americas cup race 
the san diego crew skippered by dennis conner sailed a 
catamaran to victory against the mercury bay yacht clubs 90foot 
monohull in a race off san diego in september and retained the 
americas cup 
but the judge said it is clear that a catamaran may not 
defend an americas cup competition against a monohull 
tom mitchell a spokesman for the san diego club said his group 
would meet this afternoon to decide what action to take next 
the mercury bay yacht club of auckland new zealand first went 
to court in 1987 arguing it should be allowed to challenge san 
diego in a oneonone race for the cup in a boat larger than the 
12meter yacht ordinarily used 
the new zealand club also argued the race should be held in an 
interval of less than the customary once every four years 
the deed establishing the cup requires only a 10month interval 
between races and sets no limit for boat length it also does not 
require a series of elimination races as there have been for the 
past several decades 
the judge on dec 21 1987 agreed to the matchup and ordered 
san diego to defend the cup against the new zealand challenge and 
its 90foot craft san diego was to use the 12meter boat which 
runs about 45 feet at the waterline 
but conner instead decided to use a catamaran a much faster 
and more maneuverable craft and easily defeated the challenging 
craft financed by michael fay 
fay went back to court after losing that race and asked the 
judge to invalidate the results 
the judge today said she was mindful that forfeiture is a 
drastic remedy because of the cups large economic significance 
and prestige 
but she said the parties had suggested no other alternative and 
nor is alternative relief feasible under the circumstances

george bush dropped in unannounced at a 
suburban high school today eating lunch in the schools cafeteria 
visiting a computer center and telling students you learn 
something from every step outside the white house you take 
the president visited james madison high school in vienna a 
suburb of washington dc in advance of his upcoming release of a 
package of legislative proposals dealing with education 
bush who during the campaign vowed to be the education 
president first chatted with students in the schools computer 
center then he sat on a stool in the schools library and answered 
questions for nearly 30 minutes 
bush talked about this stupid abuse of drugs and said 
weve got to mobilize the entertainment media to combat drugs 
suggesting that movies have tended to glamorize drug use over the 
years 
weve got to change the way this problem has been looked at 
he said 
he said movies often treat cocaine use in a humorous vein or 
made the user look like a silly idiot 
weve got to say look dont put out great emotion in favor 
of cocaine or other drugs a lot of it is education this is not 
going to be solved from the white house its going to be solved by 
the american people young and old saying enough is enough 
answering a question about international terrorism bush said 
its like dealing with fog you cant get hold of it very well 
one student asked bush how a president has time to visit a 
high school 
a very good question he replied were perfecting now an 
education package tell you how it works in a campaign you get 
certain themes of what you think is right for education it is 
important that people be computer literate i think math and 
science are important i favor magnet schools i favor trying to 
set up a system to reward the better teachers i think you learn 
something from every step outside the white house that you take 
now bush said he was trying to put his campaign vows on 
education into a legislative package on his twohour trip to the 
school bush said its symbolic in some sense but you also 
pick up information as you go along 
you have go balance that with your overall responsibilities 
he added 
on a foreign policy question bush said the longsought peace in 
the middle east has escaped us all escaped the world you 
still see a lot of killing and so we have a particularly 
important role there we are the only country that can be a 
substantial catalyst for peace there 
he mentioned his meetings next week with leaders from israel 
egypt and jordan 
bush joined the students in the school cafeteria downing a 
lunch of pizza french fries and milk

the rejection of top officials in multicandidate 
balloting by soviet voters is a blow to the communist partys 
prestige but not necessarily to president mikhail s gorbachev who 
masterminded the electoral reforms 
legions of angry voters may have done for gorbachev what he has 
not been able to accomplish in four years of reform shake up 
entrenched bureaucrats he says are slowing him down 
at the same time gorbachev has said hes willing to risk public 
criticism of the kremlin in order to establish a more open society 
and the elections demonstrated that will be a price he pays for 
tolerance but the outcome also enhanced his standing as a leader 
serious about reform 
gorbachevs proposal of a new election law last year was 
designed to increase public participation in government affairs and 
perhaps to make the kremlin more responsive to the public in its 
first admittedly imperfect round of nominations and balloting the 
law focused a spotlight on many government and party officials 
unaccustomed to the glare of nationwide multicandidate balloting 
and some found the exposure most unpleasant 
the losses suffered would have been unimaginable until just 
recently a candidate politburo member and party leader of 
leningrad the party chief of kiev the president and premier of 
lithuania moscows mayor moscows no 2 party leader and 
regional party chairmen throughout the country 
in contrast moscow residents gave 89 percent of their votes to 
boris n yeltsin the capitals former party boss in a stunning 
endorsement of his antiestablishment campaign 
gorbachev has long complained that the complacency or outright 
opposition of many ranking officials is slowing his 4yearold 
reform effort 
asked tuesday about the effect of the election on gorbachevs 
political standing a senior western diplomat in moscow said i 
suspect it will strengthen his hand there are instances in which 
party chiefs were defeated and the yeltsin vote is evidence that 
the radical reforms have to continue the diplomat spoke on 
condition he not be identified 
virgilijus chapaitis a leader of the lithuanian grassroots 
movement sajudis which defeated the republics president and 
premier said gorbachev need not fear this election its not a 
victory against the party its a victory of the progressives 
at least some of those rejected by voters sunday including the 
government leaders in lithuania and kiev city party chief 
konstantin masik had been targeted by reformers because of their 
hardline views but information on the leanings of many others was 
not available 
the voters rejection of top local officials for the national 
parliament did not sweep them from the jobs that give them great 
power and prestige however it was an embarrassment that could 
seriously weaken their power base party leader anatoly gerasimov 
in leningrad and the partys no 2 leader in moscow yuri 
prokofiev received less than 20 percent of the vote 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said the party 
would review reasons why candidates lost and local party 
organizations would decide what to do with unpopular officials 
gorbachev has said that criticism leveled at top leaders 
including himself by soviet citizens is an acceptable price for 
reform 
he said after voting sunday that he supports competition at all 
levels and said that even supporters of yeltsins populist 
candidacy could be a positive influence because they wanted to push 
the reform process further along 
gorbachev did not face the voters on sunday because he and most 
other members of the ruling party politburo were elected to be 
among the 100 deputies to which the party is entitled in the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies 
of 641 top party officials who took part in that balloting 12 
voted against gorbachev i would be very much upset if there was 
no criticism gorbachev said when asked sunday about the negative 
votes 
the size of the antiestablishment vote nationwide showed 
officials did not tamper with the results thereby indicating 
gorbachev is serious about democratic reforms 
monitors from the usbased international human rights law 
group said the election process appeared efficient and that they 
saw no evidence of cheating 
us secretary of state james a baker iii asked on nbctvs 
today show if he thought gorbachev would regret the election 
said 
i dont think so i would have to say of course that we feel 
that the jury is still very much out on whether or not perestroika 
will succeed baker said we dont think therell be any 
reversal of whats taken place though because once you let people 
taste the fruits of freedom its pretty hard to put the genie back 
in the bottle but im not sure hell rue the day

the supreme court on tuesday barred states 
from taxing federal pensions if they exempt the pensions of retired 
state and local government workers 
by an 81 vote the court struck down michigans differing tax 
treatment of the pensions received by retired government employees 
the courts lone dissenter said the decision will affect similar 
tax laws in at least 14 other states arizona colorado georgia 
louisiana maryland missouri montana new york north carolina 
oregon south carolina virginia west virginia and wisconsin 
the challenged michigan law violates principles of 
intergovernmental tax immunity by favoring retired state and local 
government employees over retired federal employees justice 
anthony m kennedy wrote for the court 
he said paul s davis a lawyer living in east lansing is 
entitled to a refund of 4299 on taxes he paid from 1979 through 
1984 
davis worked for the federal government at various times in his 
career retiring in 1980 
he challenged the michigan law that allows federal retirees 
living in the state to deduct only up to 7500 of their annual 
federal pensions when computing their state tax liability the law 
permits retired employees of the state government and local 
governments within michigan to deduct all their state pensions from 
their state taxes 
michigan courts had upheld the law 
kennedy said the law impermissibly clashes with a federal law 
authorizing states to tax federal employees if the taxation does 
not discriminate against the employee because of the source of 
the pay or compensation 
the justices rejected arguments by michigan authorities that the 
law applies only to federal employees not federal pensioners 
the court said the inequity among government workers may not 
continue but the justices left it up to michigan courts to decide 
whether the proper remedy would be exempting all federal pensions 
from state taxes or exposing the pensions of state and local 
government retirees to some state taxation 
justice john paul stevens in a spirited dissenting opinion 
said i cannot join the unjustified courtimposed restriction on 
a states power to administer its own affairs 
in a separate ruling the court said federal criminal defendants 
who fail to persuade a judge to dismiss their indictments because 
of alleged misconduct by prosecutors cannot appeal before they are 
tried and convicted 
the unanimous ruling in a case from buffalo ny likely means 
the court will turn down two appeals that have been pending before 
the justices for some time 
in one exwhite house aide oliver north former national 
security adviser john m poindexter and arms dealer albert hakim 
are attempting to challenge a judges refusal to dismiss their 
indictments stemming from the irancontra affair 
a federal appeals court ruled that the three could not make 
their prosecutorialmisconduct appeal before they stand trial 
north currently is on trial and the other two are awaiting 
trial 
in a second pending case hotel owners harry and leona helmsley 
are challenging their 1988 taxevasion indictment in new york city 
in a third decision tuesday the court made it easier for people 
who win partial victories in civil rights lawsuits to get their 
lawyer fees paid by the losing side 
the court ruled unanimously in a texas case that those who 
prevail on a significant issue in such suits are entitled to 
reimbursement even if they lose on the cases central issue

chinese will be allowed to sue their government 
under a new law submitted tuesday but a noted legal scholar said 
the legislation comes down heavily on the side of protecting the 
state 
another law also submitted tuesday delineates the powers of 
the national peoples congress chinas legislature it too 
favors a centralization of power 
both laws are expected to pass as submitted during the current 
session of the legislature 
the legislation allowing the lawsuits officially known as the 
administrative procedure law completes a series of legislation 
promulgated since 1979 which aim at instituting a rule of law in 
china 
in 1979 china passed its criminal code law allowing the state 
to take the people to court in 1985 it passed a law on civil 
suits allowing people to sue each other 
under a draft of the new law chinese may sue their government 
and its agencies if their lawful rights and interests have been 
infringed upon by a specific administrative act of an 
administrative organ or its personnel 
infringement can include fines the restriction of freedom 
refusal by an administrative bureau to carry out a task and the 
compulsory seizure of property 
the main problem is that the law allows chinese people to 
challenge the legality of an act but not the law itself thus if 
the government can prove its action was based on a law no suit can 
be brought according to the draft 
zhang shuyi a researcher at the political science and law 
college of china said this problem shows the law doesnt 
adequately protect the interests of the people 
writing in the world economic herald zhang said the law ends 
up protecting the government more than anything else 
the strange thing is that for the longest time weve turned a 
blind eye to the violation of the peoples rights he said but 
at soon as someone says the people should be allowed to sue 
somebody says we have to protect the interests of the government 
since when do we have to protect the power of the 
government he said the goverment by its nature is power 
the key to understanding this problem is that lawmakers and 
executors in china want to ensure the courts dont become too 
powerful he said 
this is not like the united states where they have a 
separation of powers and the various departments battle on an equal 
footing he said the goal is to keep the courts weak 
since the communist revolution in 1949 law was regarded as 
bourgeois and a tool of capitalist society 
but in reality political campaigns and purges since 1957 
culminating in the ultraleftist cultural revolution resulted in a 
massive infringement of basic rights red guards closed the 
schools religion was repressed and people were jailed beaten and 
killed because they were born into a family that once belonged to 
the upper classes 
beginning in 1978 a reform movement to open china to the west 
and introduce elements of a market economy into the staterun 
system pushed change in the legal system 
reformers led by deng xiaoping were concerned they did not 
repeat the abuses of the past they also were sensitive to the 
demands for legal protection for foreign clients who want to do 
business in china 
major problems remain however 
although chinas constitution guarantees freedom of opinion 
thousands of prisoners remain jailed for political beliefs in 
addition the courts remain powerless when compared to the 
communist party and the administrative wing of the government 
an example appeared on the front page of sundays peoples 
daily which reported that three lawyers were arrested and jailed 
for several months because they chose to enter an innocent plea for 
a rape suspect the prosecutors office disagreed with the plea and 
ordered them jailed on charges of protecting a criminal the 
paper said 
their case eventually was taken up by the national peoples 
congress and they were released 
another problem with the legal system concerns the function of 
the congress ostensibly responsible for making laws in china 
under the second piece of legislation submitted tuesday the 
congress can only propose laws after 30 of the approximately 3000 
delegates submit a bill and it passes the inspection of the 
congress presidium 
since the presidium is nominated by the state council chinas 
cabinet the effect of the law is to further centralize government 
power in the councils hands the law known as the rules of 
procedure for the national peoples congress gives the state 
council power to submit legislation directly the communist party 
controls the state council

the president of the united arab emirates 
cant avoid questioning in a lawsuit involving his personal 
investments by claiming head of state immunity new york 
states top court ruled tuesday 
his highness sheik zayed bin sultan alnahyan who rules abu 
dhabi the capital of the united arab emirates must submit himself 
to a deposition before litigation involving 96 million can be 
resolved the new york court of appeals said in a unanimous 
decision 
sheik zayeds testimony is needed to resolve a flurry of 
lawsuits involving lasidi sa a swiss investment firm and 
financiera avenida a panamanian firm both of which funneled the 
arab leaders money into overseas investments 
the panamanian company sued lasidi sa claiming it used the 
sheiks funds in an unauthorized manner the court said the swiss 
company launched a defamation suit and asked for the sheiks 
testimony 
lower courts dismissed avenidas lawsuits because the sheik 
refused to give a deposition claiming he didnt have to under the 
international commonlaw doctrine of head of state immunity 
the court of appeals upheld the lower court rulings 
the sheik cannot seek to recover some 96 million in personal 
funds by counterclaims brought in an american court through his 
corporate alter ego while at the same time invoking head of state 
immunity as a means of insulating himself from discovery on the 
matters directly related to the substance of those counterclaims 
the court wrote 
since avenida is a corporate shell with no functioning officers 
or directors theres no one else for the lawyers to talk to the 
court said

james garner has reached a 
multimilliondollar settlement of his lawsuit against universal 
studios over delayed profit payments from the rockford files 
television series garners lawyer said 
attorney marvin burns declined to reveal terms of the 
settlement which he called satisfactory garner previously had 
rejected a 6 million offer by universal to settle the lawsuit in 
which he demanded 165 million in damages and unpaid profits for 
the popular 1970s show 
garner and other actors claimed that studio accountants charged 
excessive expenses using these calculations to cut into payments

antiwar activist daniel berrigan has defeated a landlords efforts 
to evict it from its home lawyers said tuesday 
landlord johny melohn had claimed the 23 jesuits occupying 16 
apartments in his building on manhattans upper west side were in 
effect operating a monastery which he said were grounds for him to 
deny them a new lease 
but civil court judge joan lobis ruled that the apartments on 
several floors in a 135apartment building did not constitute a 
monastery and the lease was renewable said carol anne herlihy 
lawyer for the jesuits 
the judge also rejected melohns argument that the jesuits did 
not use the building as their primary residence herlihy said 
the jesuits work as chaplains teachers counselors writers and 
lecturers berrigan gained public attention as an antiwar

the harbor reopened and a fleet of tankers 
anchored offshore churned in to pick up oil today for the first 
time since the biggest spill in us history closed the port at the 
southern end of the alaskan pipeline 
authorities meanwhile investigated reports that the captain of 
the tanker responsible for the 100squaremile spill in prince 
william sound had drinking problems and winds that had the oil 
moving like its on a superhighway died down 
at the white house president bush said that the federal 
government would consider taking over the cleanup after top 
officials travel to alaska today to take a hard look at where 
this disaster stands 
coast guard lt ed wieliczkiewicz said an arco tanker would be 
the first to arrive at the valdez marine terminal and nine other 
tankers would follow he said the oil slick spreading across the 
sound was clear of shipping lanes 
the port had been closed since the accident friday cutting the 
flow through the alaska pipeline which supplies nearly 20 percent 
of the nations domestic oil some industry experts had predicted 
sharp price increases from an extended shutdown 
the accident reduced the oil flow through the pipeline to 
800000 barrels a day from 21 million 
we look at all areas in an investigation and thats an area of 
concern national transportation safety board spokesman bill 
woody said of reports that exxon valdez capt joseph hazelwood had 
a drunken driving conviction as recently as september 
hazelwood probably will be required to testify at ntsb hearings 
that begin april 4 woody said 
hazelwood 42 was not on the bridge when the vessel left 
shipping lanes on friday to avoid ice and ran aground said exxon 
officials the third mate who did not have proper certification 
was in charge company president frank iarossi said 
investigators said the results of drug and alcohol tests on crew 
members will be made public perhaps in two or three days 
hazelwood pleaded guilty in 1984 to driving while intoxicated 
after an accident near his home in huntington ny the new york 
times reported today he was convicted of drunken driving in 
september in new hampshire and his license was revoked the paper 
said his drivers license had been suspended on two other 
occasions during the past five years the time said 
the cleanup monday was set back by 70 mph gusts that swept the 
slick more than 30 miles toward the southwest but gusts died down 
to 13 mph today officials said 
beaches on four uninhabited islands have been fouled and the 
slick fast approached sensitive salmonspawning areas 
the cleanup is not proceeding well believe me that is an 
understatement iarossi said monday weve got a mess on our 
hands 
its unbelievable that slick is moving like its on a 
superhighway said iarossi 
fewer than 135000 gallons of oil have been recovered from the 
101 milliongallon spill 
asked whether he was satisfied with exxons efforts bush said 
theyre certainly making a good beginning here but there are 
some conflicting reports on that i dont want to prejudge that 
bush said transportation secretary samuel skinner environmental 
protection agency administrator bill reilly and coast guard 
commandant paul yost would evaluate the operation first hand and 
that a federal takeover is an option 
the goo also threatened the regions abundant herring marine 
mammals and seabirds biologists said 
there are bird populations all over the place said pamela 
bergman an interior department spokeswoman nearly 100 oiled birds 
and two oiled sea otters have been spotted and many more stricken 
animals likely have gone undetected she said 
the cleanup was getting more difficult as the leading edge of 
the slick moves into more remote areas of the sparsely inhabited 
sound 
bergman and others said efforts to rescue thousands of animals 
were hampered by fears that volunteers would be endangered in the 
remote area with its rugged shores harsh weather and powerful 
wild animals also any animals rescued could die in the time it 
would take to transport them to a hospital 
the 987foot tanker was carrying 12 million barrels of north 
slope crude oil when it ran aground 
about 240000 barrels spilled through the hull creating the 
slick that has spread to more than 100 square miles 
the port of valdez has been closed since the accident stranding 
tankers and cutting production on the north slope which supplies 
nearly 20 percent of the nations domestic oil 
coast guard cmdr steven mccall however said he planned to 
reopen the port today 
the vessel remained stuck on bligh reef about 25 miles from 
valdez iarossi said the wind pivoted the ship 12 degrees to the 
north and that the crew said the new position felt much more 
stable 
iarossi and exxon spokesman don cornett said efforts to unload 
the 1 million barrels that remained on board the vessel were 
progressing well iarossi said exxon hoped to have about 95 percent 
of the remaining oil off the vessel in three or four days 
cornett said it appeared increasingly likely salvage crews will 
be able to unload the exxon valdez refloat it and get it to 
drydock without spilling more oil 
the wind did damage some of the containment booms used to corral 
the oil iarossi said 
fishermen held a news conference monday to complain that exxon 
was not taking adequate steps to warn cleanup workers and nearby 
villagers about the health threat from the oil and from burning it 
with jelled gasoline 
smoke from test burns conducted on the spill last week prompted 
complaints of nausea and severe headaches among residents of 
tatitlek a village of 100 
youre talking about fish were talking about human lives 
said norman vlasoff the whole village is getting sick 
gov steve cowper has declared prince william sound a disaster 
area and said he would seek federal money to help with the spill 
i think sorting out the money is something that will occupy 
lawyers for years to come cowper said we will do everything 
possible to make sure the industry pays for this 
cornett said the company has no cost estimate for the cleanup 
which could take months

a south korean dissident defied his 
government and met with north korean president kim il sung to 
discuss reunification of the two nations it was reported tuesday 
the rev moon ikhwan and kim held talks monday that were 
overflowing with compatriotic sentiments about ways to end the 
division of the korean peninsula according to north koreas news 
agency 
kim told moon that since national reunification is a 
nationwide cause anyone may come even individually if he wants to 
discuss the question of reunification and we will welcome him 
the korean central news agency said 
on tuesday moon visited kims birthplace a favorite north 
korean tourist spot and watched a revolutionary opera the news 
agency said 
moons visit has provoked controversy in south korea where 
government officials say he is serving north korean interests 
public opinion appears to be against his trip 
the visit also has fueled demands from seoul hardliners for a 
crackdown on south koreas dissident groups prosecutors in seoul 
said monday that moon will be prosecuted for aiding north korea 
when he returns 
south koreans cannot visit north korea without government 
permission 
moons secret visit came shortly after president roh taewoo 
ordered a crackdown on dissidents and radical students he allleged 
were trying to stage a leftist revolution roh cited the threat in 
justifying his decision march 20 to indefinitely postpone a 
promised referendum on his leadership 
police seized more than 3000 copies of allegedly pronorth 
korean books and arrested 11 publishers in raids monday night in 
seoul as part of rohs suppression of leftist groups prosecutors 
said 
north korea appealed for koreans on both sides of the border to 
take a more active part in efforts to reunify the peninsula it 
said south korean authorities along with the united states sought 
to keep the division 
the news agency said north korean political parties and 
organizations met monday and declared that reunification is not a 
task confined to specified classes and strata or to the 
authorities 
to our regret the agency said the south korean 
authorities are openly suppressing the efforts of south korean 
personages and organizations or various circles to have dialogues 
with the north 
it said if people meet and hold a dialogue they can easily 
come to understanding and pool their will and turn the 
atmosphere of confrontation into that of unity and resolve the 
tangled problems between the authorities without much difficulty 
also on tuesday sports officials from both countries reported 
progress on forming a joint team for the 1990 asian games in 
beijing 
aside from the sports talks begun march 9 the two koreas have 
been holding intermittent talks since august on improving 
relations little progress has been made as each side has tended to 
push its own proposals 
the peninsula has been divided since the end of world war ii in 
1945 north koreas invasion in 1950 triggered a threeyear war 
and the two sides continue to station thousands of troops along 
their border

inmates infected with the aids virus 
will be able to use pseudonyms and wear disguises when they appear 
as witnesses in a trial of their lawsuit against the state a 
federal magistrate has ruled 
but they will have to give their testimony in an open courtroom 
us magistrate joan glazer margolis said monday 
attorneys for the inmates who are suing the state department of 
correction to improve medical care had asked that all proceedings 
be held in a judges chambers and that only edited versions of the 
trial transcripts be made public 
the attorneys from the connecticut civil liberties union and 
yale legal services had argued that strict secrecy was needed to 
protect the prisoners from harassment by other inmates and 
retaliation by the state 
the classaction lawsuit brought by the inmates seeks to force 
the correction department to improve medical care for inmates 
carrying the aids virus and increase aids education and counseling 
for all prisoners 
attorneys for the state had agreed to the use of pseudonyms but 
opposed efforts to close the trial and seal portions of the 
transcripts 
in her ruling margolis noted the importance of protecting the 
privacy of the inmates but said she reluctantly concluded there is 
a less restrictive alternative 
margolis authorized the use of fictitious names by those 
bringing suit and ordered there shall be no testimony of a 
sufficiently detailed nature to compromise their identities 
inmates may also testify in a disguised manner so that he or 
she will not be recognized by facial or other characteristics 
the decision said 
the magistrate held out the possibility she would be willing to 
modify her ruling on a casebycase basis in instances where the 
guidelines are insufficient to protect an identity

president bush dispatched three highranking 
officials to alaska on tuesday to take a hard look at the 
nations worst oil spill and judge whether the government should 
take over the massive cleanup job from exxon 
with an oil slick spread across 100 square miles of prince 
william sound bush said the first priority is to protect the 
environment and clean up this disaster then he said the 
government will decide on any penalties for the spill 
this is a matter of tremendous concern to alaskans and 
indeed to all of us bush said the conservation side is 
important the energy side is important 
bush was briefed on the disaster by transportation secretary 
samuel skinner environmental protection agency chief william 
reilly and coast guard commandant paul yost immediately after the 
meeting in the oval office they left for alaska 
the oil spilled into the water after the 987foot tanker exxon 
valdez trying to avoid ice rammed a reef and ran aground friday 
fewer than 135000 gallons of oil have been recovered from the 101 
milliongallon spill 
the ships captain joseph hazelwood was not on bridge when the 
accident occurred instead the third mate who did not have proper 
certification was in charge according to exxon shipping co 
which owns the tanker 
the harbor reopened tuesday tankers anchored offshore churned 
in to pick up oil and winds which had been moving the oil died 
down the port had been closed since the accident reducing the 
flow of oil through the alaska pipeline coast guard lt ed 
wieliczkiewicz said the oil slick spreading across the sound was 
clear of shipping lanes 
commenting on reports that hazelwood had a drinking problem 
national transportation safety board spokesman bill woody said 
we look at all areas in an investigation and thats an area of 
concern 
bush and skinner hinted exxon could face big civil penalties 
there are a variety of legal options that are available but 
right now the primary consideration is to make sure everything 
possible is being done skinner said 
and the president has directed us to assess that that oil is 
being contained and that the oil that remains on the tanker is 
being offloaded as quick as possible that is our primary objective 
as mandated by the president well then later on worry about 
who is going to pay for the damage 
but there are significant penalties and provisions for 
reimbursement skinner said 
bush said the thing is to get it cleaned up to protect the 
very precious environment out there to make sure everything is 
being done to clean up this disaster and then well have all these 
penalties and all that later on 
at this point exxon is in charge of the cleanup in one of the 
worlds most environmentally sensitive and biologically rich marine 
waters bush said that 14 federal agencies also were involved and 
that much of the equipment has been furnished by the coast guard 
asked whether exxon was doing enough bush said ive just had 
a report that theyre certainly making a good beginning here but 
theres been some conflict reports on that and i dont want to 
prejudge that i think one of the things were interested in 
hearing is exactly how our top officials feel the cleanup is 
going 
bush said there is an option for federalization of the 
cleanup and then the question is is that the most prudent way to 
go 
by some estimates the cleanup will require several months 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi said monday the cleanup 
is not proceeding well believe me that is an understatement 
weve got a mess on our hands 
bush said he was dispatching the federal team to take a hard 
look at where this disaster stands he said they would report to 
him after their investigation 
the president said the disaster had not affected his endorsement 
of environmentally prudent oil exploration in the arctic 
national wildlife refuge a vast expanse of wilderness that is home 
to caribou polar bears and a variety of waterfowl in the 
northeastern reaches of alaska 
i see no connection bush said 
theyve been shipping oil out of here for a long long time 
and never had anything of this magnitude or this concern i 
dont know how you design against what appears to be the cause here 
you have a ship thats out of the channel going 12 knots and 
ripping the bottom out of the most modern tanker thats ever been 
built to haul this oil 
at a separate news conference 11 major environmental groups 
blasted the oil industry for breaking promises of assuring that 
environmental accidents such as the spill in alaska would not 
occur or if they happen would be quickly cleaned up 
the great accident they said wouldnt happen has now 
happened said michael mccloskey chairman of the sierra club 
brock evans of the national audubon society said weve had 
enough of oil industry promises they cant be kept

a medical equipment manufacturer agreed in a plea 
bargain tuesday to pay 764000 in penalties for selling thousands 
of defective pacemakers and batteries prone to corrosion 
cordis corp pleaded guilty to 12 felony counts and 13 
misdemeanors in the criminal case 
the company agreed last week to pay 5 million to settle a 
civilfraud claim filed by the government four company executives 
still face a criminal trial in september on related charges 
the miamibased company which sold its pacemaker division two 
years ago was accused of distributing 2200 faulty pacemakers and 
6000 batteries subject to corrosion between december 1983 and 
october 1985 
the us food and drug administration charged the pacemakers 
implanted under the skin to regulate the heartbeat could stop 
without warning but no medical emergencies have been linked to the 
devices 
the justice department and cordis had been negotiating a plea 
since last year but us district judge stanley marcus rejected 
one version last october saying the punishment was insufficient 
the company had offered to plead guilty to 24 counts and pay 
264000 in fines and costs 
the agreement accepted by marcus on tuesday added a felony 
charge carrying a 500000 penalty for intent to defraud the fda by 
failing to relay adverse field reports as required 
formal sentencing in the criminal case against the company has 
been set for april 25 marcus is not bound by the restrictions of 
the plea agreement 
the company agreed last week to pay 5 million to settle the 
civil claim by the veterans administration which purchased an 
undisclosed number of the pacemakers and to cover reimbursement 
for devices purchased through medicare and medicaid programs 
cordis spokesman chick mcdowell said there havent been any 
lawsuits filed by people who bought the pacemakers or had them 
implanted by the va 
the justice department said the civil settlement was believed to 
be one of the largest medicare recoveries ever 
cordis general counsel daniel g hall who entered the guilty 
plea on the companys behalf said the company has paid 1 million 
already and the remaining penalty plus interest will be paid within 
three years 
cordis which sold its pacemaker business to the australian 
medical device manufacturer telectronics now concentrates on 
making catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and 
gauges for monitoring pressure on the brain 
the company reported net losses of 561 million in 1987 but 
underwent a major restructuring after selling the pacemaker 
operation net earnings for 1988 totaled 24 million on sales of 
132 million

the oftenfolksy plots caused some wags to dub it 
schmalzwaldklinik but that didnt stop it from becoming the 
top tv series in west german history 
there were an average of 20 million viewers every saturday it 
ran that is an absolute record for a weekly series said

continue 
the show should continue said harald kerner a fan 
it was exactly right for the mass audience kerner told the 
munich daily abendzeitung newspaper dream professions beautiful 
scenery and love stories things that make life worthwhile 
one of the reasons for the shows success was that it regularly 
featured wellknown west german actors as guest stars such as gerd 
froebe who was in the james bond movie goldfinger 
froebe who died in september made his final major appearance 
in the schwarzwaldklinik as a zestful old man who celebrates 
his 100th birthday at the clinic 
the show revolved around handsome middleaged surgeon klaus 
brinkmann portrayed by klausjuergen wussow his family and the 
closeknit hospital staff 
brinkmann soon fell in love with christa a nurse who later 
became a physician christa played by gaby dohm appealed to many 
west german women who saw her realizing a successful career as a 
doctor 
one of the highlights of the series was when brinkmann suffered 
a heart attack at the same time christa was giving birth to their 
son benjamin 
brinkmanns fatherfigure image to his staff and family was 
enhanced in one of the last episodes when he donated of his own 
kidneys to save the life of his nephew 
adding to interest to the series was udo brinkmanns 
physicianson from a previous marriage udo played by sascha hehn 
easily won viewers hearts with onagain offagain romances the

peoples minds because the danger is here every day 
tuesday morning tmi unit 1 puffed white steam into the inky 
predawn sky signaling that the reactor deep inside the plant was 
pumping heated water and driving steam turbines 
ten years ago in the adjacent unit 2 water was blocked on the 
steam side of the reactor and a pressure relief valve on the 
radioactive side stuck open within three hours loss of cooling 
water caused half of the 150ton core to melt and 20 tons of 
uranium fuel and debris streamed to the reactor bottom water still 
in its lower reaches of the vessel prevented a meltdown through the 
steel reactor vessel 
radioactive gas was released to the atmosphere and within days 
tens of thousands of nearby residents had fled for safer areas 
gordon tomb a spokesman for gpu nuclear corp the utility 
subsidiary that operates the plant now said extra people had been 
assigned to the main gate this morning 
over the years these demonstrations have been peaceful and we 
didnt expect anything different this year he said 
as for the anniversary itself tombs said were inclined to 
take the opportunity to note the lessons from the unit 2 accident 
and remind ourselves of the importance of remembering those 
lessons 
the health effects of the accident continue to be debated 
various studies found no evidence of increased human cancers but 
antinuclear activists claim the studies were flawed and say they 
have seen evidence of increased cancers and vegetation mutations 
the nearly 1 billion cleanup of unit 2 should be completed late 
next year at dawn only three protesters remained their candles 
flickering as photographers took a last round of shots 
even though the numbers were small people are tired after 10 
years everyone still has strong feelings said sean downey one 
of the protesters 
the accident it not over its still in effect

the united nations is two to three 
weeks behind schedule in preparing an observer force for the 
namibian independence process which begins saturday a topranking 
official said tuesday 
also tuesday officials reported the first gunfire against un 
soldiers in namibia but there were no injuries 
the wrangle in the un general assembly over how much to spend 
on the oneyear operation and how many observers to send cut 
drastically into time available for logistical arrangements said 
cedric thornberry of ireland the main assistant to un special 
representative martti ahtisaari 
we had told them we needed a minimum of six to eight weeks we 
got a month thornberry said but it looks like we will start 
on april 1 
ahtisaari a finn is scheduled to arrive saturday to oversee 
un efforts to ensure that south africa conducts free elections in 
the territory it has controlled for 74 years 
the voting planned for the first week in november will be to 
choose a constituent assembly that will write a constitution and 
organize namibias first independent black majorityruled 
government 
we are not going to delay the elections thornberry said 
except in the case of something being done or not done that would 
interfere with the fairness of the election then we would stop the 
clock 
he said most of the un military units are in position but the 
arrival of civilian workers and police monitors may be delayed 
because of the lack of accommodation and vehicles 
the un group will consist of 4650 un peacekeepers 500 
police monitors about 620 election monitors from various nations 
more than 760 un civilian administrators and about 820 locally 
hired staff 
ahtisaari said 803 military staff and 129 civilians are already 
in namibia thornberry said he expects the south african 
administratorgeneral of the territory louis pienaar soon will 
begin repealing discriminatory laws that might interfere with a 
fair election and start the process of freeing political prisoners 
but in the meantime he said the south africans remain in 
charge of border controls and law enforcement he said there is no 
plan to force repeal of laws which restrict hospitals and schools 
by race 
he said there would be discussions about pienaars plan to set 
the voting age in namibia at 21 rather than 18 as in south africa 
government opponents say pienaar wants to restrict the numbers of 
younger voters who may be more likely to favor the southwest 
african peoples organization or swapo which fought south african 
rule since 1966 
the mission is budgeted at 416 million of which over 52 
million has already been collected from un member states 
ahtisaari said the total will go over 100 million by late next 
week when some major pledges are paid 
south africa has ruled namibia for 74 years since it captured 
the colony from germany during world war i 
in 1920 the league of nations granted pretoria a mandate to 
govern namibia in 1966 the un general assembly revoked that 
mandate but the world body was unable to wrest control of the 
mineralrich territory from south africa 
in december south africa signed accords with angola and cuba 
agreeing to free namibia if 50000 cuban troops stationed in angola 
are sent home by mid1991

us officials said tuesday that iraqs 
agreement to pay 2735 million to the families of the 37 sailors 
killed in the attack on the uss stark is a satisfactory and fair 
settlement but it is unclear when the payments will be made 
the agreement formally announced by the state department 
represents about 92 percent of the 296 million the united states 
had requested for the families of those who died in iraqs 
unprovoked missile attack on the stark in 1987 
bush administration officials privately described the agreement 
as satisfactory and a fair settlement the sources 
speaking on condition they not be identified also said it remained 
unclear when iraq would hand over the money they said iraqi 
officials had offered the settlement in a takeitorleaveit 
manner 
the officials said americans who were in baghdad to settle the 
matter were called in to see iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz on 
monday and told that this was what iraqi president saddam 
hussein had decided 
there were no negotiations one source continued they 
just announced this was what they were prepared to pay 
it was apparent to our delegation that this was going to be 
the best they could do they didnt dicker said another official 
the sources said they could not explain how iraq settled on the 
figure 
the government of iraq has agreed to pay over 27 million as 
full compensation for the deaths state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler announced tuesday 
the agreement was reached in baghdad monday following 
discussions between the foreign ministry of iraq and a united 
states delegation she added 
a victim compensation payment by iraq has been described by us 
government officials as the most important step the mideast country 
can take to maintain good relations and follow through after its 
public apology 
iraq has acknowledged that one of its warplanes fired on the 
stark on may 17 1987 in what it said was a case of mistaken 
identity the iraqis said the fighter thought it was attacking an 
oil tanker bound for iran 
the united states has accepted that explanation by iraq while 
pressing for financial compensation 
administration sources said the united states still plans to 
press iraq on two other claims a request for 829 million to 
cover repairing the ship and a request for compensation for 
sailors who were injured but survived the attack 
the stark was part of a us naval task force that has patrolled 
the persian gulf since 1949 the attack in 1987 came when the 
iraniraq war was heating up 
the stark was steaming on a routine patrol tracking a jet 
fighter it had been told was assumed friendly assumed iraqi 
then two exocet missiles struck the guidedmissile frigate 30 
seconds apart the first was a dud the second left 37 dead almost 
sinking the ship 
two months later the united states was protecting oil tankers 
owned by iraqi ally kuwait and the us navy had made the 
transition to a wartime footing because of the stark incident 
skippers were authorized to shoot first and ask questions later 
before fighting ended in a ceasefire last august the uss 
vincennes had shot down an iranian airliner with 290 aboard 
mistaking it for an iranian jet fighter 
while the ceasefire brought relative calm to the gulf american 
officials were unhappy over iraqs failure to settle the stark 
compensation claim 
defense officials recently accused the iraqi government of 
stonewalling and the administration decided to send a team to 
baghdad last week led by state department legal adviser abraham 
sofaer 
the original claim was based on a complicated assessment under 
which each of the families would receive an average of 800000 it 
was not known what the average payment would be under reduced total 
in the iraq agreement 
the government of iraq has undertaken to make prompt payment 
of the full amount said one defense official payments will be 
made to the families as quickly as possible after the receipt of 
the funds

at least 37 key communist party and government 
leaders went down to embarrassing defeats in the soviet unions 
first multicandidate election according to results trickling in 
tuesday from across the nation 
the losers in balloting for a new national parliament included a 
candidate member of the ruling politburo the premiers of latvia 
and lithuania and 27 communist party leaders from major cities 
regions and republics according to results obtained from 
interviews and various press reports 
the humiliation was greatest for officials who ran unopposed on 
the ballot and still lost because more than 50 percent of the 
voters crossed out their names 
activists in cities from leningrad to kiev waged crossout 
campaigns urging citizens to vote against certain officials by 
blacking out their names on the ballots 
izvestia reported tuesday what it called the sensational 
result that no one was elected in 168 electoral districts where 
there were only one or two candidates because so many citizens 
voted against them 
in the weeks prior to the election activists carried posters in 
kiev illustrating ballots with several names crossed out ukrainian 
communist party chief vladimir shcherbitsky won anyway but voters 
rejected both the party chief and the mayor of kiev all three ran 
unopposed 
in leningrad deputy mayor alexei bolshakov also lost despite 
facing no opposition scraps of handmade posters appeared 
throughout the city in recent weeks suggesting he be defeated for 
that reason alone according to a resident 
the defeat of so many top communist party and government 
officials was seen as a blow to the establishment but foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov said tuesday that 80 
percent of the partys candidates had won 
although those rejected for seats in the new congress of 
peoples deputies retain their current positions gerasimov said 
local party organizations will examine the losses and decide their 
future 
maybe they were wrong for their posts he said maybe they 
failed to advertise their platforms every case should be taken 
separately 
in lithuania where voters rejected the baltic republics 
president premier two vice premiers the planning commission 
chairman the minister of justice five party officials and a 
mayor local media questioned whether the council of ministers and 
presidium should be dissolved in light of the peoples lack of 
trust 
lithuanian council of ministers spokesman cheslovas jurshenas 
responding to that question at a press briefing said only that the 
election was for the national parliament and did not concern the 
officials posts in the government of the republic 
despite intense interest most election results have yet to be 
reported in soviet media tuesday nights television news did not 
mention any specific races 
runoff elections are scheduled april 9 for districts in which 
candidates failed to win more than 50 percent of the vote but it 
was not clear how soon there could be new nominations and entirely 
new elections in the districts where voters rejected one or both 
candidates 
human rights activist andrei sakharov is expected to be 
nominated next week as a candidate from the academy of sciences 
where only eight of 23 contenders received 50 percent of the votes 
on the first round the academy has 20 guaranteed seats in the new 
congress 
although a number of the winners are progressives from inside 
and outside the party it is not clear if they will constitute a 
significant force on the 2250member congress of peoples 
deputies or on the approximately 500member working parliament to 
be chosen from among the deputies 
nor is it clear if the newcomers will find common issues to 
unite them 
but virgilijus chepaitis a leader of the political reform group 
sajudis which swept the lithuanian elections said he believes 
onethird of the new deputies will be progressives dedicated to 
liberalizing the political and economic system of the soviet union 
chepaitis also raised the possibility that deputies would 
quickly form coalitions to enhance their political power he 
specifically suggested that the baltic republics of lithuania 
latvia and estonia might find common interests with the smaller 
autonomous regions inside the huge russian republic 
boris yeltsin the former moscow party chief who campaigned for 
an end to special privileges of the party elite swept to an 89 
percent victory in the parliamentary district encompassing all of 
the capital after his win he left for a months vacation

here are texts of letters between 
ayatollah ali montazeri and ayatollah ruhollah khomeini indicating 
that montazeri is being ousted as khomeinis successor they were 
translated from tehran radio reports monitored by the associated 
press 
montazeris letter to khomeini 
i received your letter dated march 26 
i thank you for your kindness and guidance and assure you that 
just as i have been like an obedient soldier always with you in the 
way of islam and the revolution now too i see myself compelled to 
obey your orders because the survival and stability of the islamic 
republic rests on obeying your orders 
it is not doubtful for anyone that this great islamic revolution 
has passed through many dangers through your leadership and 
guidance and has thwarted many enemies such as the heartless 
monafeqin hypocrites referring to iranian rebels whose hands 
are red with the blood of thousands of our people and our great 
personalities including my own son and many other opposing 
fronts and antirevolutionaries and misled liberals 
can anyone forget the horrific crimes and the inhumane blows of 
these heartless lot to the revolution and the nation 
and if their mouthpieces and alien radios think that by 
spreading rumors about me they can reach their vile goals and 
cause rifts in the unity of our nation they are greatly mistaken 
and about my designation as your successor 
i myself was seriously opposed to it and with attention to the 
many difficulties and the heaviness of the burden of 
responsibility wrote to the council of experts at the time that my 
designation was not correct and now i openly declare my lack of 
readiness and ask you to order the council of experts to keep in 
mind the good of the future of islam the revolution and the 
nation and allow me just like before to remain a small teacher in 
the islamic schools under your guidance 
and if there have been mistakes which are the nature of 
mankind god willing they will be rectified by your guidance 
and i would like to ask my dear brothers and sisters not to do 
anything about the the great leaders decision anb the council of 
experts using their support for me as an excuse 
because the leader and the council want nothing but the good of 
the nation

khomeinis letter accepting montazeris resignation 
as you have written the leadership of the islamic republic is a 
difficult task it is a very grave responsibility which requires 
endurance more than your capacity 
for that reason both you and i were both from the beginning 
against your appointment in this regard both thought in the same 
way 
but the experts council of experts had arrived at that 
conclusion and i did not want to interfere in their legal 
jurisdiction 
having accepted your resignation i sincerely thank you for 
declaring your lack of readiness for the position of deputy 
leadership everybody knows that you are the result of my life as 
a student and that i have strong attachment to you 
in order that former mistakes are not repeated i advise you to 
cleanse your household from unsuitable individuals and seriously 
prevent the comings and goings of the opponents of the system who 
pretend to be in favor of islam and the islamic republic 
i also gave you the same advice in the case of mehdi hashemi 
i see your interests and that of the revolution in the fact that 
you must be a theologian whose views could be utilized by the 
regime and the people 
do not be affected by the spread of lies from foreign radio 
stations our people know you well they have also learned well of 
tricks by the enemy who show their enmity to islam by making 
false attributions to iranian authorities 
the dear scholars and the leaders of the friday prayers as 
well as the media should clafify this simple matter for the 
people that in islam the good of the regime takes precedence over 
everything else and we must all obey this

a man who claims he lost his job as a dallas 
high school football coach because he is white should collect 
damages from the school district his attorney told the supreme 
court on tuesday 
but the dallas independent school districts attorney countered 
in oral arguments that norman jett former south oak cliff high 
school coach and athletic director has no right to seek damages 
from a government entity 
jett who said he is now in the building and construction 
business has settled with the principal who transferred him to 
another school frederick todd who is black for 75000 
a federal jury had awarded jett 850000 in damages but he said 
it was reduced to more than 600000 with 10 percent interest for 
five years by a federal trial judge 
jett had coached the south oak cliff football team since 1962 
in the spring of 1983 he was transferred to another high school 
jett had been named head coach and athletic director at south 
oak cliff in 1970 the year the racial composition at the school 
changed from chiefly white to chiefly black todd became the 
schools principal in 1975 
jett claims the school superintendent had the final say on his 
transfer and thus the school district should be held liable for 
damages for violating his civil rights because he says he was a 
victim of racial discrimination 
his attorney frank m gilstrap of arlington texas said that 
even though the school district has an antidiscrimination policy 
it can still be held liable for actions of an employee who violates 
that policy 
school district attorney leonard j schwartz of dallas said a 
persons civil rights are not violated when people cannot seek 
damages from a municipality or school district because they can 
still collect from the individual responsible 
the supreme court is studying a 5th us circuit court of 
appeals ruling that ordered a new trial for jetts lawsuit 
his suit alleged that school officials violated his dueprocess 
freespeech and equalprotection rights 
a jury found that the city school district should be held 
legally liable for what it found to be violations of jetts rights 
but the appeals court ruled that the jury did not make sufficient 
findings to support municipal liability the appeals court 
ordered a new trial for that reason 
the cases are jett vs dallas independent school district 
872084 and dallas independent school district vs jett 88214

vehicles about 37000 more than the epa estimated 
the recall brought to 35 million the number of 19821985 gm 
vehicles that the epa as a result ofthe problem has ordered the 
automaker to fix for free 
the replacement is going to be a switch of a better design 
for it is a design problem with general motors said martha 
casey epa spokeswoman 
gm said it had voluntarily complied with the epas finding that 
the recall was needed the folks in detroit were anxious to 
stress we were doing it on our own said grey terry a gm 
spokesman in washington 
he said the malfunctioning switch doesnt affect the operation 
of the vehicles 
although epa issued no formal recall order under the agencys 
program failure of a maker to recall the cars would result in an 
order casey said 
the epa said the gas vapors escaped not only from the exhaust 
but also from the carburetors gas tanks fuel lines and other 
parts of the vehicles 
the thermal vacuum switch when working properly funnels 
unburned gasoline fumes into a cannister from which they are 
rerouted to the engine and burned before entering the atmosphere 
casey said 
gm began notifying owners by mail that they may bring their cars 
in to a dealership for repair without charge the automaker said 
the work would take about an hour 
the epa estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of the cars 
manufactured each year are recalled to fix emissions problems the 
agency ordered more than 3 million vehicles recalled last year the 
third largest number in the programs history 
this trend is expected to continue as the vehicle population 
grows said richard wilson director of the epas office of 
mobile sources we will continue to work with vehicle 
manufacturers toward solving these emissions problems

the state department on tuesday accused 
panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega of fostering harassment 
against us military personnel and workers at the panama canal 
theres clearly a deliberate effort by the noriega regime to 
harrass us and panamanian citizen employees of the us 
government said department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
the statement comes as william r gianelli chairman of the 
panama canal commission has expressed fears the campaign of 
harassment could jeopardize continued use of the waterway 
his office has issued a statement urging countries that send 
ships through the canal to pressure noriega to end the harassment 
over the past several months members of noriegas panamanian 
defense forces have accosted canal workers and us military 
personnel stationed in panama the incidents have increased as 
uspanamanian relations have worsened 
noriega is under indictment in florida on drug trafficking 
charges and the united states has refused to recognize the 
authority of noriegas ally president manuel solis palma 
as the united states continued pressing its campaign to force 
noriega to step down the panamanian government began to take steps 
against the canal workers such as denying them license plates for 
their cars 
in one incident earlier this month several buses containing 
children attending the us militaryrun schools were detained for 
nine hours because they allegedly did not have the proper license 
plates 
the panamanian government now states that in order to obtain 
license plates the driver must prove he or she has paid local 
taxes but washington has barred tax payments to panama as part of 
its program of economic sanctions against the noriega regime 
asked about reports of continued acts of intimidation directed 
against the us military protecting the canal and the americans 
and panamanians who work there ms tutwiler said the united states 
intends to fulfill its role under the 1977 panama canal treaties 
under the pacts the united states has the primary 
responsibility for the canals operation and its defense until dec 
31 1999 after which panama assumes responsibility and sovereignty 
over the waterway 
we respect our treaty commitments and intend to meet our 
obligations to ensure the canals safe efficient uninterrupted 
operation ms tutwiler said 
asked whether the united states intends to increase its security 
in the area if harassment continues ms tutwiler replied only that 
we will continue to meet our treaty responsibilities 
the united states has about 10000 military personnel in panama 
to defend the panama canal most of the about 8000 employees 
working at the canal are panamanian

nuclear power plants are a danger to the 
publics health and safety an advocacy group charged tuesday 
releasing a report that showed more than 33000 nuclear plant 
incidents have occurred in the 10 years since the three mile island 
accident 
the study nuclear power safety 19791989 charts an 
increase at the beginning of the decade followed by a leveling off 
in the number of reported events at nuclear plants 
the incidents include failures or breakdowns of plant systems 
and procedures which may pose a threat to public safety the 
operating utility must report these incidents to the nuclear 
regulatory commission by filing a licensee event report or ler 
the report was released a decade after the march 28 1978 
accident at three mile island the nuclear power plant in 
pennsylvania where the nations worst commercial atomic plant 
accident occurred 
since the three mile island accident no utilities have begin 
construction of nuclear plants there are now 108 operating nuclear 
plants in the nation 
although some of these mishaps may seem relatively innocuous 
it should be remembered that when combined in sequence these 
seemingly small incidents can result in a major nuclear accident 
as was the case at tmi said the report prepared by public 
citizen an organization founded by consumer activist ralph nader 
the nrc has a system for grading the severity of lers but 
public citizen did not take this into account presenting only 
total numbers of lers 
a decade after the accident at three mile island the nrc and 
the nuclear industry have forgotten the lesson of tmi said joan 
claybrook public citizens president the plants pose a 
continuing danger to the publics health and safety 
but nrc spokesman joseph fouchard said the plants are safer than 
a decade ago and noted that public citizen gets its numbers from 
us and of course analyzes them in its own way 
there have been fewer challenges to the system fewer 
automatic shutdowns the amount of waste generated at these plants 
has gone down theyre cleaner and the amount of cumulative 
radiation exposure to employees has gone down fouchard said 
all of the safety indicators are going in a positive direction 
in 1979 there were 2310 reported mishaps at the nations 67 
nuclear reactors including the partial meltdown of tmi 2 in 
middletown pa the number increased to 3804 in 1980 to 4060 in 
1981 and to 4500 in 1982 by 1983 the number of reported 
incidents exceeded 5000 at 82 operating plants the group found 
in 1984 however the nrc changed its system for reporting such 
events and the total number of lers dropped to 2460 that year 
according to public citizen 
the following year 1985 there were 3050 lers and the nrc said 
the period was one of the worst years in the history of the nuclear 
power industry marked by 645 emergency plant shutdowns and 38 
fines totaling nearly 4 million levied against utilities 
since then the number of nuclear plant mishaps has apparently 
leveled off although even the nrcs data is incomplete and thus 
these figures probably do not reflect the entire sum of reportable 
mishaps each year the report said 
for example in 1984 the first year that the new reporting 
requirements were in effect the nrc estimated that between 12 
percent and 35 percent of reportable mishaps were not reported the 
study said 
if the nrcs assessment is correct the ler count per reactor 
simply reflects the mishaps which the industry chooses to report 
while the actual number of potentially significant safety events 
may be much higher public citizen said 
the number of lers has remained relatively constant since 1985 
2960 in 1986 and 2955 in 1987 incomplete data for 1988 reveled 
2296 mishaps at the nations 108 licensedtooperate reactors 
total mishaps for the 10 years 33475 
the report is a compilation of findings from public citizens 
annual nuclear power safety reports and preliminary data being 
gathered for the groups forthcoming 1988 report the data were 
obtained under freedom of information act requests and from other 
nrc sources

president bush paid a surprise visit to a 
suburban high school tuesday and fielded questions on subjects 
ranging from drugs to the middle east telling students you 
learn something from every step outside the white house you take 
bush also ate lunch in the school cafeteria where surrounded by 
several hundred chattering teenagers he munched on pizza and 
french fries and sipped milk through a straw 
in the excurison which was unannounced and for which the 
schools principal had only 90 minutes warning the president 
travelled by motorcade to james madison high school in this 
virginia suburb about 15 miles from the white house 
the president who during the campaign vowed to be the 
education president first chatted with students in the schools 
computer center then perched on a stool in the library and 
answered questions for 30 minutes 
anybody got any questions about my line of work bush asked 
one student asked about the new white house puppies theyre 
doing fine bush said another student asked bush how a president 
has time to visit a high school 
a very good question bush said i think you learn 
something from every step outside the white house that you take 
its symbolic in some sense but you also pick up information 
as you go along you have to balance that with your overall 
responsibilities 
the trip comes in advance of bushs submission to congress of an 
education package expected to include a variety of proposals 
highlighted in bushs budget speech to congress last month 
including the first installment in a 500 million national merit 
schools initiative an effort to reward the nations best teachers 
a 100 million expansion of a magnet schools program and an 
expansion of head start 
bush aide stephen hart said that the legislation would be 
submitted to congress sometime within the next few weeks but 
that now specific date had yet been spent 
bush talked with the students about this stupid abuse of 
drugs and said weve got to mobilize the entertainment media 
to combat drugs suggesting that movies have tended to trivilize 
drug use in recent years 
he said movies of late have tended portrayed cocaine use in a 
humerous vein or made the user look like a silly idiot 
wve got to change the way this problem has been looked at 
bush said 
answering a question about international terrorism bush said 
its like dealing with fog you cant get hold of it very well 
on a foreign policy question bush said that the longsought 
peace in the middle east has escaped us all escaped the world 
you still see a lot of killing and so we have a particularly 
important role there we are the only country that can be a 
substantial catalyst for peace there 
he said he hoped some progress toward the peace process could 
come from his meetings next week with the leaders of israel egypt 
and jordan 
asked a question on drugs and guns the president cited the 
review going on in his administration on semiautomatic assault 
weapons theres a lot of laws on the books that need to be 
enforced and maybe theres a need for more laws 
you have to balance out all those interests 
sami van vliet a 16yearold junior told bush her church group 
had inflated balloons for the annual white house easter egg roll 
the day before but were prevented from taking extra balloons home 
with them because they were government property 
she complained that the group had wanted to take some of the 
balloons to ghana for our mission trip that were going on 
i was just wondering what you do with 10000 balloons that 
say a family easter at the white house 1989 she asked 
if only i had known about it youd have been able to carry 
more than that one with you bush said 
another student invited bush to speak at the schools graduation 
on june 15 asking him how busy is your schedule 
i dont know how busy it is i dont even dare look till 
tomorrow but thanks for the invite he said 
a spokesman for fairfax county schools dolores bowen said the 
education department had asked for information on seven or eight 
schools monday afternoon 
at 730 am today a white house advance team showed up to meet 
with principal edward ryan who thought the officials were there to 
set up a visit possibly by first lady barbara bush sometime in 
the future 
about 930 am roughly 90 minutes before bush arrived ryan 
learned his visitor would be the president and he would be there 
before the morning was out

the united states has been unable to come up 
with an approach for compensating families of the 290 people who 
died when the uss vincennes shot down an iranian airliner over the 
persian gulf last year a us official said tuesday 
nothing much has happened said the official who has 
knowledge about the situation and spoke on condition of not being 
identified 
thenpresident reagan had said families of the victims of last 
julys tragedy would be compensated but that no other reparations 
would be made the administration said compenation must go to the 
families and not to the government of iran 
the official said the government viewed the compensation as 
simply an expression of grief for the loss of life and that no 
liability has been assumed for the incident 
the official said the united states has received a passenger 
list from the iranians but specifics such as age and other 
information about the individuals have not been obtained 
such information is needed to help determine the compensation 
he said 
weve tried a number of channels to obtain information but 
nothing has been accomplished over the past several months the 
official said 
the united states broke formal diplomatic relations with iran 
after the 1979 takeover of the us embassy in tehran

an oregon lawmaker tuesday urged the bush 
administration to impose trade sanctions against japan in an effort 
to force the japanese to lift trade barriers that block imports of 
us wood products that could be worth 12 billion a year 
these are strong actions to contemplate rep ron wyden 
dore said in a letter to us trade representative carla hills 
but we believe the record of japanese restrictions with respect 
to wood products may be among the most onerous in the pacific rim 
wyden asked hills to investigate allegations from the national 
forest products association that the japanese use duties licensing 
constraints exclusive distribution arrangements and building code 
restrictions to block imports of us wood products into their 
markets 
under federal law wyden said once the investigation is 
complete hills would recommend specific remedies to the 
president 
wyden told hills that recent amendments to the 1974 trade act 
would then require the president to take agressive action against 
these foreign trade barriers up to and including countermeasurers 
affecting japanese imports to the united states if a satisfactory 
resolution cannot be negotiated 
japan recently refused to reopen socalled sectorspecific 
talks on forestry products talks wyden said offered what 
appeared to be the surest and swiftest solution to these trade 
problems 
the national forest productions association said that japanese 
barriers affect such us products as softwood and hardwood logs 
and lumber plywood veneer millwork laminated wood products 
waferboard and particleboard 
the association said that while 22 billion worth of us wood 
products were sold in japan last year over 70 percent involved raw 
materials

and now for the pet owner with everything 
cosmetic surgery for dogs 
there are medical reasons and reasons like they just dont 
look pretty people dont want to be apologetic for their pets 
looks said dr bill sanders who performs pet makeovers in his 
aardvark etc veterinary hospital 
its amazing what you can do with animal skin that you cant 
do with a persons he said 
sanders says he most often removes unsightly scars from dogs 
cats and other domestic animals but he also repairs broken jaws 
and crooked legs and removes unwanted patches of white hair 
although it sounds like a luxury reserved for the rich and 
famous sanders said he discusses pet owners requests at length to 
ensure they are best for the animal 
sometimes the animal doesnt need cosmetic surgery sanders 
told a newspaper columnist recently its wonderful that so much 
can be done with just good grooming 
sanders disputes that cosmetic surgery is frivolous or cruel 
one of the big things on my side is to stop pet abuse 
sanders said with the surgery people often take an attitude 
that the pet is more than just something you kick around

an official human rights committee 
wrote a letter to the prime minister criticizing new legislation on 
human rights and proposing changes the state news agency reported 
tuesday 
in the letter the governmentappointed committee suggested 
legislators distinguish more clearly between civic rights and 
responsibilities in march legislation that stiffens penalties for 
protestors the ctk agency said 
the official human rights committee was established on dec 9 in 
an apparent move to offset rising protest 
so far the committee has focused on helping citizens obtain 
exit permits and other cases of minor human rights abuse 
some czechoslovaks have accused the committee of failing to 
speak against police brutality during a week of antigovernment 
protests in january that spurred the new legislation 
the protests focused on the anniversary of the jan 15 1969 
suicide of jan palach who burned himself alive to protest the 
august 1968 sovietled invasion that crushed the prague spring 
liberal reforms

the three mile island accident which he faced 
as pennsylvania governor 10 years ago taught attorney general dick 
thornburgh not to rely on bureaucratic channels or on the news 
media he said tuesday 
thornburgh had been pennsylvanias chief executive 72 days when 
a combination of human and mechanical error triggered the nations 
worst commercial nuclear accident at the susquehanna river plant on 
march 28 1979 
widely credited for his calm handling of the accident 
thornburgh has often spoken in the past about the lessons he 
learned during the five days following a stuck valve that allowed 
vital cooling water to drain from the unit 2 reactors radioactive 
core 
the speech thornburgh gave tuesday at the national press club 
was virtually identical to an address he presented at duke 
university in april 1985 called three mile island ten lessons 
in emergency management 
in the speeches thornburgh said he learned a manager should 
not be afraid to scramble the organization chart as we did during 
three mile island 
he compared his handling of the accident to president kennedy 
during the curban missile crisis when his own brothers advice 
weighed more heavily with him than that of the secretary of state 
or the joint chiefs of staff 
thornburgh also said managers in emergencies should respect 
but do not depend on the news media while much of the reporting 
of the accident was reliable he said some was downright 
outrageous 
no one was hurt during the accident although radioactive gas 
was released into the atmosphere and pregnant women and 
preschoolers were advised by thornburgh to evacuate within five 
miles of the plant 
thornburgh added a postscript to tuesdays speech saying the 
1986 accident at chernobyl that killed at least 31 people might 
have been prevented if the people of the soviet union were as free 
to question their authorities as were americans in 1979 
after tmi thornburgh served a second term as governor beginning 
in 1982 then headed the institute of politics at harvard 
universitys kennedy school of government before becoming attorney 
general last august

police in a black homeland 
have been arresting and beating residents of a rural community who 
unsuccessfully sought to keep the area part of south africa civil 
rights workers said tuesday 
chief pupsey sebogodi leader of the braklaagte community said 
more than 100 residents have been arrested in recent days by police 
of the bophuthatswana homeland according to field workers of the 
transvaal rural action committee 
aninka claasens one of the workers of the johannesburgbased 
civil rights group said the arrests began after high school 
students returning to braklaagte in a bus were stopped at a 
roadblock last week and asked by bophuthatswana police if they 
considered themselves citizens of south africa or the nominally 
independent homeland 
those who declared they were south africans allegedly were 
clubbed with rifle butts 
ms claasens said sebogodi was arrested friday after he 
complained about the incident to officers at a new police base set 
up in braklaagte 
she said lawyers had been unable to locate sebogodi since his 
detention and had been barred from visiting many other braklaagte 
residents held by police 
bophuthatswana president lucas mangope issued a statement 
tuesday saying sebogodi and 40 other people were arrested on 
charges of arson damage to property and public violence after four 
homes in braklaagte were set afire last week 
the police action was a routine maintenance of law and 
order mangope said no persecution of south african citizens 
took place nor were any children assaulted 
the south african foreign affairs department which handles 
relations with the four black homelands established by south 
africas whitedominated government said it had asked 
bophuthatswana about the allegations and was awaiting a replay 
sebogodi on behalf of braklaagtes 9000 residents went to 
court last year to try to nullify the south african governments 
declaration that braklaagte would be placed under the jurisdiction 
of bophuthatswana he said his people faced hardship and 
discrimination if the community was incorporated into the homeland 
on march 13 a judge dismissed sebogodis petition upholding the 
governments claim that it had authority to allocate land to tribal 
homelands regardless of the residents wishes 
sebogodis constituents who live in a farming area about 100 
miles west of pretoria had voiced opposition to the bophuthatswana 
government and sought to retain south african citizenship which 
could give them advantages in seeking employment 
the incorporation is part of south africas policy of locating 
black ethnic groups in selfgoverning homelands to limit the size 
of the black population in the rest of south africa 
the homelands are not recognized internationally 
bophuthatswana includes seven separate pieces of territory 
covering about 18000 square miles and has a population estimated 
at 17 million

braselton settled the community in 1876 
herbert braselton 69 said tuesday from his hardware store that 
the sale will close during the summer 
its very sad we shed some tears today he said but 
were glad to get somebody we trust that will do this place proud 
ms basinger whose movies include blind date 9 weeks 
and the natural grew up in nearby athens 
braselton said he doesnt know exactly what her plans are for 
the town though he has heard she might renovate some of the older 
buildings and establish some sort of tourist attraction 
braselton said 24 members of his family own stock in the family 
holdings including the 1800 acres which is 80 percent of the 
northeast georgia town most of the family members are elderly and 
none of the younger braseltons was interested in holding onto the 
land he said 
weve gotten to the age where we had to let someone else take 
over while we have our senses and can make good judgments he 
said 
braselton said he doesnt know how much money he will make on 
the deal what i receive will be ample he said adding that he 
is keeping his own residential property 
he said it was a relief to finally sell the land and he added 
that the family rejected numerous offers 
i have a box full of offers braselton said the primary 
difficulty was the terms people wanted 40 years to pay to 
people in their 70s and 80s that doesnt interest them we got a 
cash deal 
braselton about 40 miles north of atlanta has about 500 
residents the local government will not be affected by the sale

the health hazards of living on the street dirt 
skin disease and swollen feet are treated three nights a week by 
doctors who volunteer their services at a temporary shelter for the 
homeless 
the free service is among fewer than 100 around the country that 
tap the good will of the medical profession advocates say they 
wish there were more 
trying to help the homeless hang on to their health involves 
coping with some ailments such as lice and tuberculosis that are 
virtually unknown in affluent america doctors say 
they come with sore feet they come with skin infections they 
come with skin breakdown said dr joseph dorsey one of the 
volunteers from the harvard community health plan alcohol is a 
very major factor in leading people to be here he said its a 
real leveler 
the state and cityfunded shelter at a vacant national guard 
armory is run by the nonprofit private corporation positive 
lifestyles it takes in about 200 men a night shift supervisor sam 
larsen said monday 
we have everything from chronic alcoholics to working poor to 
heavily drugaddicted guys he said i think the common theme 
is that they were once able to afford housing and they cant any 
longer 
about 50 medical personnel volunteer at the shelter with 
another 50 involved in other ways dorsey said he said an intern 
at harvard community health plan came up with the idea to volunteer 
at the shelter and participants were sought through a signup list 
similar volunteered services are available elsewhere in such 
diverse cities as washington dc columbia sc duluth minn 
cleveland san francisco and seattle 
estelle nichols runs the 14yearold free clinic of roanoke 
va and is treasurer of the national association of free and 
community clinics she estimated there are fewer than 100 such 
clinics nationwide relying on free help from doctors 
there are a good number out there but there really are not 
enough ms nichols said tuesday in a telephone interview 
there are not more now because cities have not organized them 
if there is one thing i have found out its that doctors 
are waiting out there for you to call them ms nichols said 
they want an opportunity to do good work thats the reason they 
went into medicine to do good work 
the boston shelter which opened dec 2 and is scheduled to 
close this april operates the clinic seven days a week with the 
volunteer doctors working three evenings said eileen mcgee head 
nurse 
by 7 pm monday a steady stream of patients filed into the 
clinic to get their blood pressure tested foot sores washed and 
dressed and mainly to talk to the doctors about their aches and 
pains 
clinic patients say the free medical services make it easier to 
stay healthy 
if you have to go to a doctor outside you have to pay said 
dominic 52 who asked that his last name not be used 
dominic who has had surgery for throat cancer said he has 
received medical care from veterans administration hospitals and 
from a clinic run by nurses at the pine street inn a downtown 
homeless shelter 
but he said the services offered at the armory shelter are more 
convenient for him and hes more likely to make followup visits 
ivan forman 72 said he worked as a contractor for much as his 
life serving in the navy during world war ii and working most 
recently at odd jobs in a hospital and synagogue 
forman who says alcoholism took him from studying psychology at 
a university to life on the streets complained of a headache 
during his visit with the volunteer doctors and was given a mild 
pain reliever 
i think its nice and i think the doctors get something out of 
it he said 
like forman many of the patients seen at the clinic have 
relatively minor complaints said mcgee who noted that any serious 
cases are referred to a hospital

nasa officials rejected tuesday a suggestion 
by an independent safety panel that the agency cancel a 15 
billion rocket development program and direct the money instead 
toward improvements in the space shuttle 
the aerospace safety advisory panel said in its annual report 
released tuesday that the national aeronautics and space 
administration should abandon plans to build an advanced solid 
rocket motor because the money could be better used to make 
improvements in the orbiter stage of the space shuttle 
but nasa administrator james c fletcher said development of the 
advanced rocket had been thoroughly debated within the space agency 
and i havent changed my mind on that 
fletcher said nasa wants to develop a second source manufacturer 
for space shuttle solid rockets so the agency is never again left 
without a reliable rocket engine as it was after the challenger 
accident 
we dont want to be stuck with the situation we got stuck with 
before said fletcher we need to have the option of changing 
contractors 
the challenger accident in which seven astronauts were killed 
occurred when a solid rocket booster leaked hot gas and caused the 
spacecraft to explode 73 seconds after launch from the kennedy 
space center fla on jan 28 1986 the accident forced a total 
redesign and testing of the solid rocket manufactured by morton 
thiokol inc and caused the space shuttle fleet to be grounded for 
38 months thiokol remains nasas only supplier of the solid rocket 
booster 
fletcher said that because of this experience the agency wants 
to develop an improved more powerful solid rocket that could be 
manufactured by more than one contractor 
we need the option to change contractors quickly he said 
you would like to have somebody to fall back on 
joseph f sutter a former boeing vice president and chairman of 
the safety advisory board said that the panel of experts felt that 
the redesign of the morton thiokol rocket had produced a booster 
that is safe and that efforts to build another booster would mean 
that it would have to be extensively tested to develop the same 
level of safety 
sutter said that if building the new rocket takes funds away 
from other shuttle improvements we feel like it would be 
degrading to safety 
the committee chairman also said he felt nasa was forced into 
building the new booster by congress sutter suggested this was a 
mistake and that congress should get the hell out of that 
richard truly nasas associate administrator for space flight 
said that though the panel made good points the space agency 
decided to build the new rocket because the shuttle needs the 
performance 
the new rocket planned by nasa would enable the shuttle to carry 
an additional 12000 pounds into orbit he said 
also said truly there is no assurance that the rest of the 
shuttle would see those dollars if nasa decided to not build 
the new rocket 
plans call for nasa to spend 15 billion through fiscal year 
1994 to develop the new rocket motor a number of rocket companies 
besides morton thiokol are competing for the rocket contract 
the aerospace safety advisory panel is made up of 14 independent 
experts who monitor safety issues throughout nasa and make annual 
recommendations 
other recommendations by the panel included 
modify the structure of the shuttle orbiter so that the 
spacecraft is not as sensitive to adverse wind conditions during 
launch upper level winds have caused delays in the last two space 
shuttle launches 
modifications to increase reliability and safety of the 
liquidfueled rockets on the space shuttle 
make certain that the final plans for the space station 
freedom include a emergency rescue vehicle that would enable 
astronauts on the station to quickly return to earth 
that a new space suit be developed for use on the space 
station

israels police chief ordered his officers on 
tuesday to limit their practice of disguising themselves as 
journalists driving cars carrying press signs while seaching for 
palestinian suspects 
police inspectorgeneral david krauss said he will instruct all 
police units to refrain from impersonating journalists unless they 
had his personal permission 
the decision came after an appeal from jerusalems journalists 
association which said the practice could endanger reporters 
traveling in the occupied territories and arab east jerusalem to 
cover the palestinian uprising 
palestinian youths routinely stone cars with yellow israeli 
license plates but are more likely to let journalists pass 
peacefully arabowned cars in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip have blue or white license plates 
israeli journalists and the foreign press association in israel 
protested last week after two policemen in east jerusalem were 
spotted with a press sign in the window of their unmarked car and 
were later seen arresting palestinians 
krauss said monday police were legally permitted to pose as 
journalists and would continue to do so however he reversed 
himself after meeting the journalists on tuesday 
the journalists argued that police officers posing as reporters 
threatened the security and professional freedom of journalists

former attorney general edwin meese iii 
testified at oliver norths trial tuesday that the specter of 
impeachment hung over the white house in the 72 hours after aides 
discovered a planned diversion of iran arms sale money to the 
nicaraguan contras 
in two hours of testimony meese said he told thenpresident 
reagan about the diversion the day after north confirmed that the 
plan outlined in a memo had become a fact 
your worst nightmare had come true asked north lawyer 
brendan sullivan 
yes it was meese replied 
you knew that spelled trouble 
yes i did 
the nightmares that sullivan referred to was the revelation that 
two activities in which north was deeply involved had been 
intertwined the administrations secret sale of weapons to iran 
and the fact that money from the arms sales with the knowledge of 
us officials secretly was going to the rebels fighting the 
nicaraguan government at a time such aid was forbidden by law 
merging of those two factors could cause toppling of the 
president himself asked sullivan 
yes meese replied 
the memo which had survived massive shredding efforts by north 
his secretary and an aide was found on nov 22 1986 by meese 
aides william bradford reynolds in norths office the next day a 
sunday meese met with north and others at the justice department 
meese said that in the sunday meeting north appeared surprised 
that meese had obtained the memo which outlined the arms sales 
profit diversion plan 
i believe he asked where we had gotten the memo said meese 
he testified also that north assured him then that the plan was 
israels and us involvement was none and he said north told 
him he had contacted contra leader adolfo calero and suggested 
calero open three accounts in switzerland to get the money from the 
israelis 
in truth north codefendants richard secord and albert hakim 
had arranged to receive the iran money in private swiss accounts 
they established and controlled investigators found 
meese said he talked to the president on monday and they talked 
of the impact the public disclosure might have 
i dont know whether the actual word impeachment was used 
meese testified but he said there was concern over the 
tremendous consequences of the discovery 
the former attorney general said the administration also was 
concerned that its political opponents might get hold of the 
information about the diversion before it could be made public 
i felt it vital that there not be any appearance of a 
coverup he said it was decided that decided that reagan would 
hold a news conference at the nov 25 news conference reagan 
announced that north had been fired and that his boss adm john 
poindexter had resigned 
among the 12 criminal counts on which north is being tried in 
federal court are destruction of documents attempting to derail 
meeses investigation and making false statements to the attorney 
general 
a former north deputy told the jury earlier that the national 
security council aide carried sensitive documents to a shredder 
even as meeses investigators were taking a lunch break from 
searching his office 
marine lt col robert earl said north slipped through an 
alleyway to a white house shredder that day among the papers earl 
said he had previously turned over to north were documents on the 
secret arms initiative 
meese said that he learned about the diversion of funds to the 
nicaraguan rebels from the memo his men found on page five he 
said he found the plan for taking profits from the weapons sales 
and using them to buy supplies for the contras this was at a time 
when us intelligence agencies were forbidden by congress to spend 
money in military support of the rebels 
north assured him meese said that the plan for the diversion 
was israels israel was a conduit for arms involved in the 
transactions 
he said israel would decide how much money would go to the 
resistance and our involvement the cia and the nsc was none 
meese testified 
earl who was a deputy to north in the nsc structure said north 
came from a meeting in the west wing of the white house on nov 21 
and asked earl for his iran files which included records on the 
secret arms initiative to iran 
i asked him what was going on earl testified he said it 
was time for ollie to be a scapegoat 
north asked him to look for sensitive intelligence 
documents earl said and when he brought them out north put 
them on top of a stack of papers on his desk 
he said he understood that north was going to sanitize the 
papers 
to destroy documents that was your understanding 
yes sir said earl 
earl said he began to destroy documents too and when he left 
the office north was till there 
the next day a saturday richardson and reynolds searched the 
office and discovered the diversion memo 
the investigators crossed paths with north only as they walked 
down the hall for lunch as north was arriving earl said 
exchanging only a few words 
at that time you saw lt col north going around culling 
additional papers to destroy asked prosecutor david zornow 
yes earl said 
he said he saw north go outside through an alleyway and head for 
a shredder in the white house situation room where national 
security crises are monitored 
it was your understanding those papers would never be seen 
again asked zornow 
yes sir said earl 
in a related development the supreme court ruled tuesday that 
federal criminal defendants who fail to persuade a judge to dismiss 
their indictments because of alleged misconduct by prosecutors 
cannot appeal before their trial the decision likely means the 
court will turn down an appeal by north who is challenging a 
judges refusal to dismiss his indictment 
north has alleged that independent counsel lawrence walsh acted 
improperly in using norths testimony to congressional committees 
to indict him north testified before the congressional panels 
under a grant of immunity from prosecution

secretary of state james a baker iii is 
considering a new us approach to eastern europe with the overall 
goal of promoting selfdetermination and freedom among the soviet 
allies 
us relations with the countries whose fortunes have been tied 
to moscow for more than 40 years are undergoing review along with 
other aspects of american foreign policy margaret tutwiler the 
state department spokeswoman said tuesday 
former secretary of state henry a kissinger has proposed the 
new arrangement in which moscow would loosen its hold on the region 
in exchange for a pledge by the united states and its nato allies 
not to threaten soviet interests there 
without going into detail ms tutwiler said part of this on 
the merits deserves to be taken a look at 
the overall review is due to be completed april 21 or at the 
latest in early may 
baker intends to use the results in talks he will hold in moscow 
with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze in may 
our principal objective in eastern europe is to promote 
demoncratic self determiantiona and individual freedoms ms 
tutwiler said 
the spokeswoman said baker had noted welcome signs of 
movement in some of the east european countries referring to 
kissingers proposal she said part of this on the merits deserve 
to be taken a look at 
baker on a visit to vienna earlier this month met with the 
foreign ministers of hungary and poland and called in a speech for 
the soviets to cancel what is known as the brezhnev doctrine 
bakers aides said he was impressed with developments in the two 
countries 
the late soviet president leonid i brezhnev sent troops into 
czechoslovakia in 1968 to put down a revolt by communist party 
leaders who sought to liberalize the system in prague 
the soviets explained the intervention as coming to the support 
of socialism this became known as the brezhnev doctrine 
baker first disclosed his interest in the kissinger proposal in 
an interview in the new york times

the man president bush has nominated to 
oversee the forest service adamently opposed making the spotted owl 
an endangered species the fired director of the fish and wildlife 
services west coast office said tuesday 
james cason was nominated last week as assistant secretary of 
agriculture for natural resources and environment a job that would 
give him control over the forest service and the soil conservation 
service 
cason is now deputy assistant secretary for land and minerals 
management at the department of interior as such he oversees the 
operations of the bureau of land management and the office of 
minerals management service 
both the forest service and the bureau of land management are 
embroiled in lawsuits over efforts to protect the spotted owl 
which is thought to nest only in the ancient forests of the 
northwest 
cason was adamantly opposed to listing the spotted owl as an 
endangered species rolf wallenstrom the fired fish and wildlife 
service official said of cason he was part of the group at 
interior putting pressure on the director of the fish and 
wildlife service 
cason through spokeswoman kelly shipp categorically denied 
that he exerted pressure on the fish and wildlife service not to 
list the spotted owl as endangered 
he said he contributed to the policy process and was asked for 
his opinion said ms shipp 
ms shipp said cason who was in denver on tuesday will 
probably not grant interviews until after his confirmation hearing 
before the senate agriculture committee and presumed senate 
confirmation 
wallenstrom was fired as director of the fish and wildlife 
services region 1 office earlier this year after refusing to take 
a job as a special assistant to the director 
at the time he was fired wallenstrom said that he and other 
employees were being punished by frank dunkle the agencys 
director for their views on various natural resource issues that 
were opposite those of the reagan administration 
the fish and wildlife service is responsible for deciding which 
species should be protected under the federal endangered species 
act with the decisions to be based strictly on biological 
factors 
a recent general accounting office report concluded that 
officials of the interior department had put political pressures on 
the agency not to list the owl as an endangered species 
the report said that regional biologists has been ordered to 
sanitize an initial report warning that the bird faced 
extinction if logging of the oldgrowth forests in the northwest 
werent slowed 
the fish and wildlife service eventually concluded there was not 
sufficient evidence to list the owl as endangered a federal court 
subsequently found that decision was arbitrary and capricious 
and gave the agency until may 1 to review it 
wallenstrom said that cason at one point didnt even want the 
fish and wildlife service to consider a petition asking that the 
owl be listed 
wallenstrom said in a telephone interview that cason essentialy 
said the bird will be listed over my dead body cason seemed to 
think he had a bigger role in the decision than he did 
he had no official veto power but im sure he did try to 
influence thensecretary donald hodel and others

denver area water officials sought 
clarification tuesday on what steps must be taken to keep the 
proposed two forks dam and reservoir alive but got no hint on 
whether the project will survive 
i think its an uphill battle william miller manager of 
the denver water board told reporters after he and other denver 
area water officials met with the environmental protection agency 
about the dam 
last friday epa administrator william k reilly stunned the 
water board officials by ordering a review of the dam project and 
raising broad environmental objections to a construction permit 
which earlier this month had been approved by the army corps of 
engineers 
environmentalists and other critics of the 500 million dam and 
reservoir planned on the south platte river southwest of denver 
immediately declared that reillys intervention was tantamount to 
killing the project although no final epa veto has yet been issued 
miller and three other denver area water officials were among 
several dozen people including representatives of the corps of 
engineers who met with rebecca hamner acting epa assistant 
administrator for water and other epa officials on the dam project 
the session was generally described as one in which procedural 
details were outlined on what steps proponents of the dam must take 
in trying to overcome epa objections to the project 
miller told reporters that he and other proponents of the dam 
would resubmit their proposals to epa regional review officers in 
hopes of overcoming reillys objections 
nevertheless the denver official said he was disappointed and 
hurt that reilly intervened after the agencys regional director 
in denver had indicated that environmental concerns had been 
resolved 
the corps of engineers had approved a permit for construction of 
the dam on march 16 and the epas regional director jim scherer 
had indicated he was satisfied that accommodations had been made to 
mitigate environmental concerns but scherer was overruled by 
reilly who said last friday that the project as outlined in the 
permit could result in very serious adverse environmental 
impact 
miller said that while the water board would resubmit the 
proposal to the epa there was no plan to change the project 
significantly to provide additional environmental safeguards 
another participant in the meeting bernie goode chief of 
regulation for the corps of engineers in washington said that the 
decison on the two forks project now rests solely in the hands of 
the epa 
the epa is in the drivers seat goode told reporters 
the two forks dam has been the focus of bitter controversy 
between denver water officials who maintain that it is needed to 
meet the regions water needs into the next century and 
environmental and conservation activists 
environmental concerns centered on the fact that the 615foot 
dam and reservoir would flood a large area of the south platte 
including a canyon area with some of the best trout fishing in the 
state and home for a variety of wildlife 
the project also has been under attack because of fears that it 
will reduce the flow of water into the big bend wetland region of 
western nebraska a favorite resting spot for whooping crane and 
thousands of sand hill crane on their migration north

the united states threatened to impose higher 
tariffs on various fish products from canada on tuesday in a 
dispute involving canadian restrictions on the sale of raw salmon 
and herring to american companies 
us trade representative carla hills said she had determined 
that the canadian ban on sales of unprocessed herring and pink and 
sockeye salmon taken by canadian fishermen off the coast of british 
columbia violated us trade law 
hills decision represented the latest round in a longstanding 
trade dispute between the two countries 
canada in an effort to protect the jobs of workers at 
processing plants in british columbia prohibits the sale of 
unprocessed salmon and herring directly to american processors the 
fish must first be processed in canadian plants before sale to us 
companies 
the united states has been urging canada to remove this 
prohibition since 1986 america took the issue before the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade the genevabased organization which 
governs world trade in 1987 and later that year received a ruling 
upholding the us position 
it has been more than a year since canadas export 
prohibitions were found illegal under the gatt i see no choice at 
this point but to take action hills said in a statement 
hills said an interagency group of us officials would hold 
hearings next month to determine what canadian products would be 
subjected to the higher tariffs 
in the announcement of the action the us trade office said it 
would consider higher tariffs on various varieties of fresh 
chilled and frozen fish now imported from canada 
the dispute over herring and salmon was brought up at a meeting 
earlier this month between hills and canadian trade ministter john 
crosbie but the two officials were unable to narrow the differences 
between them 
at the time hills said that the landing requirement was 
unacceptable to american companies because it bruises the fish 
and we feel that we end up with a less valuable product 
canada has contended that the landing requirement was needed as 
a conservation measure to assure that canadian waters were not 
depleted american officials contend that the fish could be counted 
and inspected on the boats allowing the fish to be sold directly 
to us buyers

afghanistan is preparing for an uncertain spring 
in the aftermath of the soviet troop withdrawal the new delhi 
bureau chief of the associated press who has made periodic 
reporting trips to kabul filed the following report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the people of this capital dig in the 
earth as it thaws after a fierce winter making defenses for war 
with guerrillas and planting crops to sustain life 
green sprouts are appearing in dun fields within and just 
outside the city more plots are being prepared for planting wheat 
and vegetables 
machines carve trenches inside the airport and along a barren 
ridge that overlooks the runway and is overlooked in turn by 
mountains where the moslem fighters wait and occasionally fire 
rockets at the airport or city 
if you lose the airport youve lost kabul a un official 
said asking that his name not be used theyre building new 
defenses there and strengthening old ones 
the soviet union continues to supply weapons and ammunition but 
for the first spring since 1979 the kremlins client government is 
bereft of direct red army support against the ussupported 
insurgents 
some soviet advisers remain under a friendship treaty predating 
the civil war which began after a communist coup in april 1978 
a soviet colonel who was at the airport in february during the 
final days of the red army withdrawal was seen there about a week 
ago this time in civilian clothes a wellplaced source said 
privately he added that the colonel smiled and said he had retired 
from the armed forces 
most soviets attached to kabul university and government 
ministries left in the past year as the military withdrawal 
progressed afghan and foreign observers say however that air 
traffic controllers and hundreds of other technical workers remain 
un staff members counted 123 soviet transport planes landing 
at the airport during a week in midmarch scudb missiles and 
ammunition crates have been seen being unloaded or taken from the 
airport 
although the afghan government describes it as a food airlift 
the soviets themselves have said they would continue military 
resupply operations 
even if all available land in and immediately around the city is 
planted the crops can feed only about oneeighth of the 22 
million people crowded into the city according to un estimates 
the rest must come by air or on roads subject to guerrilla attack 
harassment and sabotage 
only four major highways connect kabul with the rest of the 
country two lead south and west into guerrilla areas some of 
which are only 15 miles from the city 
the eastern route passes through jalalabad 75 miles away where 
the guerrillas have besieged government forces for three weeks 
that leaves the salang highway which runs through the hindu 
kush mountain range and the northern wheat plain to the soviet 
border 260 miles away 
it passes through territory controlled by ahmed shah masood one 
of the ablest guerrilla commanders buses and some trucks have 
reached kabul on the salang in recent days but masoods men have 
been able to cut the highway in the past 
government and foreign aid workers agree there is no starvation 
in kabul but both say the plight of the poorest residents grows 
worse because supplies are scarce and they cannot meet the rising 
prices 
nan the staple flat bread goes for the frozen price of 6 
afghanis about 10 cents at the official rate of exchange but 
mutton the favorite meat has risen about 40 percent in three 
months while wages remain unchanged 
a kilogram of mutton 22 pounds costs 1000 afghanis 18 at 
the official exchange rate and 450 at the black market rate that 
is onefifth the average monthly pay of a government office worker 
and about half that of an unskilled laborer 
few afghans have access to the black market because they do not 
have the hard foreign currency on which it is based 
tur pekii a 35yearold woman with nine children was among 
1000 people who received free flour and sugar this week from the 
united nations 
she said her husband earned 3000 afghanis a month as a teacher 
54 at the official rate 
we cant find sugar she said through the mesh facepanel of 
a brown chadri veil that enveloped her from head to toe we dont 
want it anyway its too expensive 
sugar has gone since january from 180 afghanis a kilo to 400 
325 to 725 at the official rate

prime minister margaret thatcher of 
britain said tuesday she is willing to meet in europe with cabinet 
ministers from south africa which she pointedly refused to visit 
on her current african tour 
she repeated her call for south africa to free nelson mandela 
the african national congress leader who has been imprisoned since 
the early 1960s 
also however mrs thatcher emphasized her view that economic 
sanctions are not effective against apartheid the policy with 
which south africas 5 million whites retain privilege and deny a 
voice in national affairs to the 28 million blacks 
president robert mugabe greeted her at the airport when she 
arrived from lagos nigeria 
on the flight to harare the prime minister said she had told 
south africa she would meet with any ministers who happened to be 
in europe according to press association britians domestic news 
agency 
mrs thatcher whose visit to africa began monday in morocco is 
to be in zimbabwe until thursday then go to malawi and return to 
london on saturday 
south africa could learn from the negotiations that produced an 
independent zimbabwe which as the british colony of rhodesia was 
once ruled by a white minority mrs thatcher said at the airport 
there is a sea change in the region she declared there 
is an atmosphere about these problems now that they can be solved 
by patient negotiation 
earlier she told journalists it is better to have a 
constructive policy than one of hitting out with sanctions i do 
not think it makes sense to isolate south africa as she approaches 
these very difficult decisions the need for tact and persuasion is 
greater than ever 
the visit is mrs thatchers first to zimbabwe which her 
government steered to independence nine years ago she will confer 
with mugabe and president joaquim chissano of mozambique on 
wednesday in a border area called nyanga 
mrs thatcher was received warmly in lagos where she had been 
the target 14 months earlier of what appeared to be officially 
sanctioned antiapartheid demonstrations 
gen ibrahim babangida president of nigeria said to her in 
the last two years the relationship between our two countries has 
gotten very very close together this is made possible under your 
very dynamic and able leadership

treasury secretary nicholas f brady assured texas 
business leaders tuesday that federal regulators would not disrupt 
the states fragile economic recovery by flooding the real estate 
market with property obtained from insolvent savings and loan 
institutions 
brady also warned that delaying the bush administrations plan 
for rescuing the nations hundreds of insolvent thrifts was costing 
taxpayers 20 million per day and continued debate over alternative 
proposals would add millions more to the costs 
key elements of the plan call for the government to close some 
350 insolvent but still open thrifts and meet commitments for 205 
institutions rescued last year 
local business leaders frequently have expressed fears that the 
federal government would unload real estate acquired with the 
failed thrifts at belowmarket prices to help clear their books 
such transactions would be carried out by the federal asset 
disposition association which is charged with selling assets from 
failed thrifts or a proposed alternative vehicle 
fada currently manages about assets valued at about 38 billion 
in 33 states of those assets an estimated 259 billion worth are 
in texas 
we understand the potential destructive effects on the local 
economies of wholesale dumping brady said in a speech to the 
greater dallas chamber of commerce let me assure you that we 
intend to proceed very carefully with real estate sales 
decisions will be evaluated and made with the best interest of 
everyone involved particularly local communities taken into 
consideration he said 
brady said the government would be robbing itself by cutrate 
sales which would reduce the money that the sales could generate 
to help finance the rescue plan 
the administration is resisting efforts by sen timothy wirth 
dcolo and other legislators to write dumping obstacles into the 
sampl rescue bill being considered by congress 
bradys first trip this year to texas the state hardest hit by 
the thrift crisis is sandwiched between the end of congressional 
hearings on bushs plan and the expected start of committee work on 
the legislation when lawmakers return next week from their spring 
recess 
the treasury department is working on an alternative operating 
plan for the socalled resolution trust corp the government 
entity in the bush proposal that would liquidate failed sampls 
according to an administration official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the rtc will be free to consider a number of innovative 
proposals for preventing dumping including the creation of 
regional trusts to buy and manage problem properties or the 
securitization of pools of real estate for sale to public 
investors the official said 
obviously theres some real estate thats junkthat has no 
value now that never did have never will have you might as well 
get that behind you brady said tuesday theres other real 
estate thats wellconceived which has tenants in buildings and 
people living in condosand those kinds of properties shouldnt 
be thrown on the market willynilly and wont be 
the bush plan which would bring thrift regulation under the 
treasury department would spend 40 billion to finance the 
insolvent institutions that already have been taken care of and 
would borrow another 50 billion to be spent during the next three 
years brady said 
the treasury secretary disagreed with past suggestions for a 
onetime lump sum appropriation of taxpayers money to pay for the 
massive thrift rescues he said such an expense would make it 
impossible to meet budget deficit reduction targets which in turn 
would boost government borrowing costs 
we cannot afford delay if the debate over alternate financial 
plans takes even three weeks the cost to the taxpayer goes up by 
500 million brady said said

a combined force of leftist guerrillas and 
drug traffickers overran a jungle police post in the heart of 
perus cocaine region killing 10 officers and wounding 12 
military officials reported tuesday 
the attack at dusk monday was among the bloodiest of recent 
months officials said it may have been a response to usfinanced 
testing of a powerful herbicide against coca the raw material of 
cocaine 
premier armando villanueva and defense minister enrique lopez 
flew to uchiza site of the attack 245 miles northeast of lima on 
tuesday the government news agency andina reported officials said 
more than 100 soldiers and police troopers were sent to the town as 
reinforcements 
in june 1987 drug traffickers and maoist guerrillas of the 
shining path destroyed the police post at uchiza in the cocaine 
country of perus huallaga valley six policemen were killed in 
that raid 
shining path guerrillas has provided protection to drug 
traffickers for about two years in exchange for arms and money 
they began their insurgency in 1980 in the region around ayachuco 
in the andes 
military officials said 150 rebels and drugrunners attacked the 
50man post monday with gunfire and grenades they said surviving 
defenders fled into the surrounding jungle 
six attackers were slain and their companions carried the bodies 
away the officials said on condition of anonymity 
they said telephone connections with uchiza were cut and word of 
the attack reached lima hours later by radio still with sketchy 
details 
ten days ago the us and peruvian governments began a second 
phase of tests of the herbacide tebuthiuron sold under the name 
spike in the huallaga valley which produces about 60 percent of 
the worlds coca 
environmentalists say the chemical could destroy other plants 
and lead to widespread erosion officials said tests on 40 acres 
would track the herbicides effects on coca and the environment 
over at least a year 
coca produced in the uchiza region is partially processed in 
jungle laboratories and flown from clandestine airstrips to 
colombia where it is refined into cocaine for sale in us and 
european markets

ayatollah ali montazeri resigned on 
tuesday as the heirapparent to ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and 
said he did so at the bidding of the 88yearold revolutionary 
patriarch himself 
montazeri and two high foreign ministry officials appeared to be 
the first government casualties in a fierce drive by khomeini to 
return iran to the roots of its fundamentalist revolution 
irans un ambassador mohammad jaafar mahallati also resigned 
tuesday two days after deputy foreign minister mohammad javad 
larijani stepped down both are useducated 
khomeini last month harshly attacked those who would rebuild 
links with the west and denounced lagging revolutionary fervor 
montazeris resignation came after khomeini sent him a letter on 
march 26 asking him to step down reported irans official tehran 
radio monitored in nicosia 
i see myself compelled to obey your orders because the 
survival and stability of the islamic republic rests on obeying 
your command the radio quoted the 64yearold montazeri as 
saying 
the mujahedeen khalq irans main opposition group commented in 
a telex to the associated press from its baghdad iraq 
headquarters a wave of dismissals and resignations at 
various levels is on the rise the disposal of montazeri 
indicates an eruption at the highest level of the unending internal 
conflicts 
the immediate cause of montazeris ouster appears to be his 
critical assessment of the revolutions accomplishments 
in a speech published feb 12 by the official islamic republic 
news agency montazeri declared that iranian leaders made many 
mistakes in the first 10 years of the revolution which isolated the 
fledgling republic from much of the world his remarks drew a 
stinging rejoinder from khomeini 
montazeri was chosen by an 83member council of experts as 
khomeinis successor in 1985 the ad hoc assembly itself had been 
elected in 1982 to ensure succession in case of khomeinis death 
montazeri an close ally of khomeini since they organized an 
uprising against the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 1963 was 
chosen after khomeini hinted his support on tuesday he said he 
always opposed the move and that he simply wanted to return to 
being a religious student 
no immediate word surfaced on another khomeini successor 
khomeini had assailed montazeri without mentioning montazeris 
name after the feb 12 speech how shortsighted are those who 
think that because we did not reach final victory at the front 
that martyrdom and selfsacrifice are worthless he said 
immediately after the ceasefire in the eightyear iraniraq war 
last august khomeini apparently gave free rein to the pragmatists 
parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani and foreign minister ali 
akbar velayati seeking loans and technology to rebuild iran 
spearheaded a drive to soften irans radical image 
mahallati and larijani were instrumental in rebuilding 
diplomatic ties with the west the ties had been strained since the 
radical outbursts of the first days of the 1979 revolution iran 
saw the west then as backing the ousted shah it violently purged 
internal opposition and held 52 americans hostage in the us 
embassy for 444 days 
by last week khomeini was proclaiming that iran had drifted 
away from the values of the revolution 
he warned pragmatists that the government must do its very 
best to govern the people as best it can but this does not mean 
that it should drive them away from the great goals of the 
revolution which is the creation of a global islamic government 
khomeini first fired up the resurgence of the fundamentalist 
camp by condemning salman rushdie to death for the british authors 
novel the satanic verses saying the book was blasphemous and 
proof of the wests attempt to undermine islam 
when 14 western nations withdrew their top diplomats to protest 
the death sentence khomeini said it was proof of the futility of 
normalizing relations and parliament voted to sever ties with 
britain 
in his letter the radio said khomeini told montazeri in 
order that former mistakes may not be repeated i advise you to 
cleanse your household from unsuitable individuals and seriously 
prevent the comings and goings of the opponents of the system who 
pretend to be in favor of islam and the islamic republic 
montazeri has had close contacts in recent months with 
opposition groups such as the tiny freedom movement of mehdi 
bazargan bazargan irans first prime minister now is the 
governments most outspoken critic inside iran 
in advising montazeri to distance himself from the socalled 
liberals khomeini wrote i also gave you the same advice in the 
case of mehdi hashemi 
montazeri has been at odds with the government since december 
1986 when hashemi soninlaw of montazeris brother exposed the 
governments clandestine contacts with the united states in the 
armsforhostages deal 
hashemi was tried for treason terrorism and kidnapping and was 
executed by firing squad on sept 22 1987

lawyers for a juvenile facing murder and arson 
charges in alabama told a district of columbia superior court judge 
tuesday that sending the 17yearold back to alabama and a possible 
death sentence would violate the districts ban on capital 
punishment 
but paul alper assistant corporation counsel for the district 
government told judge stephen f eilperin he has no choice but to 
enforce an interstate agreement requiring states to extradite 
juveniles charged with crimes by other states 
failing to honor that agreement alper argued would quickly 
turn the nations capital into a haven for fleeing fugitives 
eilperin said he would rule thursday morning on alabamas 
petition to extradite the youth identified only by the initials 
om he also said he would issue an immediate stay of that ruling 
to give the losing side a change to appeal to the district of 
columbia court of appeals 
om is charged in the may 1988 firebombing of an apartment in 
gadsden ala which resulted in the death of 14monthold tamel 
jackson yul devoe guice 31 an uncle of om was arrested soon 
after the bombing and charged with murder and arson 
om was arrested by district authorities in december and has 
been fighting extradition ever since his grandmother alice guice 
thomas testified at a hearing last month that om who is black 
cannot get a fair trial from the white authorities of etowah 
county ala 
alper argued tuesday however that the fairness of the alabama 
judicial system is not at issue in the case 
we would be annoyed at the very least if the courts in alabama 
attempted to pass judgement on our system of justice alper said 
arguing that oms lawyers would have eilperin pass judgement on 
the quality of alabama justice 
gerald fisher oms lead attorney focused on the death 
penalty issue contending that the districts city council in 
banning the death penalty incorporated that ban into the 
interstate agreement governing juvenile extraditions 
but eilperin seemed reluctant to acceept that argument he told 
the boys lawyers several times that the major problem with 
their reasoning was that om is not facing the death penalty as 
long he is tried as a juvenile 
if alabama decides to try him as an adult this court is 
constitutionally obligated to send him back to alabama for trial 
eilperin said 
fisher argued however that alabama authorities cannot certify 
om for trial as an adult and subject him to a possible death 
sentence without him first being returned to the state 
an extradition order he said thus would violate the districts 
ban on capital punishment because it would clear the way for 
alabama authorities to try om as an adult should they so chose

mayor marion barry jr was fined 500 tuesday 
by the district of columbias office of campaign finance for not 
disclosing his partnership with a prominent local developer in a 
nantucket mass real estate deal 
marianne coleman niles who heads the campaign finance office 
determined that a promissory note the mayor signed in 1985 when he 
bought an interest in a nantucket building constituted an 
interestfree loan and should have been listed on barrys financial 
disclosure forms 
however niles concluded that barry did not violate the citys 
conflict of interest statute by entering into the partnership with 
developer jeffrey cohen despite barrys personal approval of some 
of cohens business dealings with the city 
top city officials are required by law to annually disclose any 
liability of more than 1000 that is owed to anyone except family 
members banks or other credit institutions the note obligates 
the mayor to pay 49000 over 10 years for a 10 percent interest in 
the building 
barry failed to list the partnership on his 1986 1987 or 1988 
disclosure forms 
this disclosure policy applies with full force to the mayor 
and every other district of columbia government official niles 
said in a release 
however niles concluded that barry may not have known that he 
was required to disclose the complicated loan deal and concluded 
the mayor did not willfully omit it 
herbert o reid barrys legal counsel wrote niles that barry 
will pay the 500 fine and amend his disclosure forms to include 
the loan but added that barry is operating with the clear 
understanding that he has not engaged in any wrongdoing 
john c white barrys spokesman said the mayor would not 
comment on the matter 
barry could have been fined up to 1500 500 for each failure 
to disclose and niles could have recommended that the us 
attorneys office investigate the matter 
the washington post reported in tuesdays editions that reid 
told niles that barry did not view the arrangement as a loan but 
simply an agreement to pay his 49000 share in installments 
barrys interest in the building was held in the name of another 
investor israel kogan a local obstetrician who served as the 
legal nominee kogan and barry formed an unregistered 
partnership named kb associates 
the building now valued at more than 1 million is owned by 
nine people including barry and cohen situated in the islands 
historic district it houses two antique shops and three apartments

the soviet union said tuesday it wants 
un military observers posted between afghanistan and pakistan to 
stop crossborder raids by the islamic guerrillas seeking to topple 
the communist government in kabul 
it is very important now to look into the situation on the 
border between afghanistan and pakistan soviet un ambassador 
aleksandr m belonogov said after meeting with secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar 
the government of afghanistan is suggesting that united 
nations military observers should be posted in the border area 
and we think this is the right idea 
the 50 military observers of the un good offices mission in 
afghanistan and pakistan monitored the soviet troop withdrawal from 
afghanistan that ended feb 15 
belonogov said the observers now should focus on what he said 
was pakistans policy of allowing the guerrillas to operate from 
bases in pakistan 
he said he believes the situation now demands much more 
attention by the good offices mission to the border area 
between afghanistan and pakistan 
us officials were unavailable for comment 
earlier in the day the state department declined comment when 
two lowerranking soviet diplomats suggested in washington that the 
united nations consider posting un border monitors 
belonogov said that he also drew the attention of the 
secretarygeneral to the inadequate situation with regard to the 
implementation of the geneva accords under which the soviet army 
left afghanistan 
those accords signed last april 14 require afghanistan and 
pakistan not to interfere in each others internal affairs 
we are proud that we honored our obligations under the 
agreements and that at the moment there are no soviet soldiers on 
afghan soil but at the same time we are concerned that these are 
not honored they are disregarded by pakistan said belonogov 
we are now witnessing deeper involvement by pakistan into the 
internal affairs of afghanistan 
the soviets and afghanistan accuse pakistan of letting the 
rebels maintain bases on its territory and launch crossborder 
raids they also say the united states violates the accords by 
supplying the guerrillas with weapons 
the rebels also received support from china and saudi arabia 
other rebels operating in western pakistan receive aid from iran 
afghan officers have accused pakistani officers of directing the 
current rebel seige of the afghan city of jalalabad 75 miles east 
of kabul

if the academy awards are best known for 
garish gowns and overlong acceptance speeches then oscaroriented 
pickets run a close third and wednesday nights awards ceremony 
will be no exception 
as the producers of the 61st academy awards hurried on tuesday 
to prepare the show protesters picketed the studios of mgmunited 
artists demanding an apology for the comic depiction of stuttering 
in the triplenominated film a fish called wanda 
if young children across the country are watching this film 
they really wont understand how the person who stutters is abused 
verbally and shamed by everyone around him said mark power a 
member of the advisory board of the national stuttering project 
i dont think a film maker would have a blind person walking 
into walls and have people kid him about that or make fun of him 
power said but its the same thing with stuttering people are 
born with the problem and theres nothing you can really do about 
it 
ironically another united artists release has been praised for 
its sensitive depiction of a disability rain man in which 
dustin hoffman portrays an autistic savant is this years most 
nominated film and is favored to win several major awards 
including best picture 
other protesters were expected to congregate at the shrine 
auditorium to take full advantage of the tremendous news media 
attention 700 members of the press will be on hand 
the rev r l hymers said he plans to demonstrate against the 
last temptation of christ which a variety of conservative 
christian leaders denounced last year for its depiction of a 
doubting jesus the film received only one nomination for director 
martin scorsese 
if they give him the academy award it will be approval of the 
spiritual pornography hymers said 
yet the shows production team was largely unconcerned with any 
controversies surrounding this years oscars as it headed toward 
curtain time 
every moment is a crisis but were sitting here perfectly 
relaxed and happy said show producer allan carr between the last 
oscar rehearsals tuesday this is as good as its going to be 
a fish called wanda is nominated for best original 
screenplay best supporting actor kevin kline and best director 
charles crichton in the bankrobbery farce kline taunts a 
character played by michael palin for his severe speech impediment 
the character loses his stutter at the end of the film when he 
runs over kline with a steam roller the movie was a boxoffice 
hit grossing more than 62 million according to exhibitor 
relations co 
the 4000member national stuttering project which says that 
more than 2 million americans stutter is asking mgm to add a 
disclaimer to a fish called wanda stating that the film did not 
intend to perpetuate negative inferences about people who 
stutter 
tracy lorie a spokeswoman for mgmua said the studio felt it 
had nothing to apologize for 
we didnt make a movie that is derogatory toward stutterers 
she said michael palins character is the most likable in the 
film 
john cleese who both cowrote and stars in a fish called 
wanda joked last week that the movies use of stuttering was why 
it received as many nominations as it did 
the best way to get nominated for something is to have someone 
in the film who is suffering from some kind of psychological or 
physical handicap cleese said 
carr the oscar show producer has added some new twists this 
year there will be no emcee instead presenters will be duets of

hundreds of students laid money at the feet 
of evangelist oral roberts tuesday after he said he must raise 11 
million by may 6 or creditors will start dismantling his university 
and ministry 
the 71yearold evangelist said scandals in other ministries 
have caused contributions to his ministry to decline from 5 
million a month to 27 million during the past two years 
speaking to a sometimes hushed and often raucous gathering of 
4300 oral roberts university students at a campus chapel service 
roberts described himself as a tough old bird intent on keeping 
the university going until jesus comes 
roberts son richard executive vice president of the school 
told students it was the greatest financial crisis in his fathers 
41year ministry 
after the elder roberts made an impassioned speech to students 
richard roberts laid a 100 bill on the stage at the feet of his 
father and mother evelyn mrs roberts suggested students might 
want to contribute too and hundreds filed down to the stage to 
leave checks change and bills in a pile 
the collection raised 8500 richard roberts said 
university officials declared wednesday a day of prayer and 
fasting on campus 
roberts first made his plea during a taping session monday for 
his weekly expect a miracle television program scheduled to 
air in part on sunday on 147 statons 
if we cant make our payroll i dont know what will happen to 
this man or this ministry roberts said during the taping 
people this is serious this is a lifeanddeath matter 
he lambasted the news media for the way they cover his ministry 
but school officials contacted reporters about his comments and 
made the unedited tape available for viewing 
the evangelists plea comes two years after he raised a furor by 
saying his life depended on raising 8 million to provide 
scholarships for his universitys medical students 
roberts announced on april 1 1987 that the money had been 
raised 
two years have passed and i have been silent he said 
during that time he said contributions to his ministry have 
declined by nearly half he said the ministry needs 10000 to 
15000 additional partners to boost monthly income to 33 
million 
with that amount coming in we can pay all bills and keep them 
paid roberts said 
he said he was laughed at mocked scoffed two years ago 
but said he was only repeating what god had told him about 
redirecting efforts in medical school missions work at the 
university 
roberts said he has fallen behind in paying for time on the 
television stations that air his program as well as for food 
services at the university supplies and other bills owed to 
hundreds of vendors 
now our vendors and suppliers have to have their money he 
said if we cannot pay the 11 million by the first week in may 
they will have to go to the extent of the law to collect their 
money 
if we dont pay it then they start coming in start 
dismantling he said 
richard roberts said the university has no plans to sell its 
commercial property including a hotel and three office buildings 
in tulsa

prime minister yitzhak shamir toured jewish 
settlements in the occupied west bank on tuesday and said he is 
still working on peace proposals he will take to washington next 
week 
israeli news reports interpreted shamirs visit to the west bank 
as a message to the us administration which has said jewish 
settlements in the occupied territories are an obstacle to peace 
in other developments two palestinians were reported wounded by 
israeli troops an israeli passenger bus was set ablaze and 
militant palestinians and israeli forces prepared for land day 
violence on thursday 
arab hospital officials said two palestinians were shot and 
wounded by israeli soldiers in the occupied lands at least 412 
arabs and 18 israelis have been killed since a palestinian uprising 
began in the west bank and gaza strip in december 1988 
in arab east jerusalem a firebomb burned an israeli bus but no 
injuries were reported 
leaflets distributed in the west bank and gaza and signed by 
various palestine liberation organization factions called for a 
general strike and attacks on land day 
palestinians mark land day from fighting in 1976 when six arabs 
were killed by army and police gunfire in riots over the 
governments seizure of arab land 
let us rain the occupiers and the settlers with thousands of 
stones and firebombs because this is the only language our enemy 
can understand said a leaflet distributed in gaza city 
the army moved reinforcements into the occupied territories in 
anticipation of land day violence in the 1988 land day riots four 
palestinians were killed and dozens were wounded 
shamir who wants more jewish settlement in the occupied 
territories was given bread salt and wine by dozens of cheering 
settlers in the har adar settlement near jerusalem in nearby givat 
zeev he was made an honorary citizen 
at a meeting in washington earlier this month secretary of 
state james baker iii reportedly urged israeli foreign minister 
moshe arens to halt plans to expand jewish settlements as a move to 
improve the climate for peace talks 
but a coalition agreement between shamirs hardline likud bloc 
and the labor party stipulates building eight new settlements over 
the next four years the two parties recently agreed to allocate 
194 million for that purpose 
some 70000 jewish settlers and 17 million palestinians live in 
the occupied territories 
shamir who is to meet with president bush april 6 was asked 
about peace proposals he might make 
we are still in the process of discussion he said there 
is no point in publishing unfinished things its not clear these 
would be accepted

president najib has offered moslem 
guerrillas local autonomy in exchange for peace with his marxist 
government and he urged field commanders to discuss it with him in 
mecca the holy city of islam 
the hourlong speech in dari the afghan language was broadcast 
by state radio monday night and tuesday the foreign ministry later 
issued excerpts in english 
najib called repeatedly for an end to afghan fratricide and 
accused pakistani militarist circles of forcing the war on the 
afghan people 
at least 35 million refugees have fled to neighboring pakistan 
during the civil war which began after a communist coup in april 
1978 and the main insurgent groups are based there 
guerrilla political leaders lead a lavish life in pakistan 
while field commanders bear the hardship and risk of the war najib 
said 
he used the dari word for compatriot in referring to the 
commanders reserving enemy for their leaders in pakistan 
dear compatriots local commanders i invite you to peace 
because i recognize you as the main party of the other side he 
declared 
before it is too late please separate your path from the 
warmongers so they do not take advantage of your blood and your 
sweat 
his continuing effort to portray himself and his government as 
islamic rather than communist was evident in the offer to meet in 
mecca saudi arabia and his frequent references to the holy koran 
najib former chief of the khad secret police has tried for a 
year to achieve a negotiated settlement the guerrillas known as 
mujahedeen or holy warriors refuse to negotiate with what they 
call a godless communist regime 
on feb 15 the last soviet troops withdrew under a unmediated 
agreement after more than nine years of direct involvement in the 
war najibs conscript army wellsupplied with modern soviet 
equipment was left to fight the insurgents alone 
soviet supply flights arrive regularly in kabul and najibs 
government says they will continue until the united states and 
pakistan stop arming the guerrillas 
in his radio appeal najib said the soviet departure left no 
reason to continue fighting the guerrillas have said they wont be 
satisfied until najib and his communist party are removed from 
power 
for three weeks insurgents have besieged jalalabad a strategic 
city 75 miles east of kabul on the only paved road to the pakistan 
border 
kabul has been quiet but heavy artillery could be heard tuesday 
10 to 15 miles northnorthwest of the city some of it was in the 
direction of the salang highway which runs north to the soviet 
border and passes through guerrillacontrolled territory 
najib promised field commanders they could keep their weapons if 
they stopped fighting and have their own territory 
my brothers wherever you are you can establish your own 
county district and subdistrict and the state will act in those 
regions on the basis of your recommendations najib said you 
can appoint your own government 
his frequent comments about pakistani involvement in the war 
seemed intended to rouse the centuriesold resentment of outsiders 
since the red army left najib and his government have increasingly 
depicted pakistan as the source of evil for the afghan people 
at un headquarters in new york soviet un ambassador 
aleksandr m belonogov said tuesday that moscow wants un military 
observers posted between afghanistan and pakistan to stop 
crossborder raids by afghan guerrillas 
artillery or rocket fire could be heard and seen over a low 
ridge about 10 miles north of the kabul airport tuesday while three 
soviet ilyushin76 transport planes unloaded sacks of flour 
half an hour later a norwegian plane chartered by the 
international committee of the red cross landed with nearly four 
tons of medicine blankets and mattresses 
alexander lange the pilot said it was his fifth red cross 
flight to kabul from peshawar pakistan since feb 15 
he reported no trouble en route but said he flew his fokker 
f27 on a circuitous course that took more than two hours rather 
than passing over jalalabad on the 45minute direct route

federal agents seized 365 million and arrested 
85 people over a twoyear period to crush the biggest counterfeit 
currency ring in secret service history law enforcement officials 
said tuesday 
they estimated that 2 million in bogus bills is still in 
circulation 
as strange as it may sound they planned to take the currency 
to colombia and palm it off on drug cartels in exchange for 
cocaine assistant us attorney daniel de vita said at a news 
conference 
instead the ringleaders got a little greedy and started 
selling the funny money said de vita who prosecuted the case 
they got caught when the money surfaced in us casinos banks and 
shopping malls and even as far away as paris 
thirty of the suspects mostly mules couriers and gofers 
were arrested in new york and the rest in los angeles chicago and 
miami during the twoyear investigation said richard ward the 
chief agent in the secret services new york office 
asked why authorities had waited so long to announce the case 
ann driscoll a spokeswoman for the us attorneys office in 
brooklyn said they had been waiting for the last of the 
ringleaders to enter his plea 
that occurred march 13 she said since then the announcement 
had been a question of scheduling 
the spokeswoman said she didnt have figures on how many of the 
85 arrested were prosecuted or on the disposition of the cases 
because a number of jurisdictions were involved 
the five new york ringleaders including former used car 
salesman francisco scocozza 55 a uruguayan living in queens were 
arrested between october and january they pleaded guilty to a 
charge of creating counterfeit currency and are awaiting sentences 
of up to 15 years in prison 
in all its believed that 80 million to 100 million in 10 
20 50 and 100 bills was cranked out at six locations in 
manhattan and queens the bulk of it in the basement of ringleader 
juan moranmunoz an argentine living in queens said de vita 
the balance of the money was dumped or burned when the suspects 
realized the secret service was onto them said us attorney 
andrew maloney sanitation workers found 18 million in choppedup 
bills in a bronx trash bin last july said ward 
of the estimated 2 million still in circulation maloney said 
we think most of these bills are of first quality to the 
unsophisticated person it could pass as real bills 
ward said the portrait on a suspected counterfeit should be 
compared to the one on a genuine bill

the city attorney filed suit tuesday against 
more than 100 alleged slumlords who trade buildings like cards at 
a card game in order to stay a step ahead of the law 
the lawsuit filed in superior court by city attorney james 
hahn charges lenders and landlords with conspiring to make a 
fortune off poor tenants while sidestepping city building code 
regulations 
the civil case was filed under the federal racketeer influenced 
and corrupt organizations act or rico 
several tenants peered out of windows at a fourstory apartment 
building where hahn held a news conference to announce a crackdown 
on 137 lenders companies and individuals allegedly involved in the 
scheme 
the lawsuit alleges that for years the defendants have engaged 
in a common enterprise and plan directed toward maintaining slum 
buildings without the repairs to make them habitable while 
extracting from them the maximum amount of rent earnings and 
profit 
the landlords allegedly avoided prosecution for building code 
violations by selling the properties after the city filed suit to 
bring them up to code when ownership changes buildings must be 
reinspected before city officials can resume the enforcement 
process 
hahn said the 42unit apartment building where the news 
conference was held had changed hands eight times since 1984 
these guys trade buildings like cards at a card game hahn 
said clearly what they are doing is not normal business 
practice 
the lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive damages for the tenants 
at least 1 million in civil penalties and court orders to repair 
buildings and to prohibit the lenders from continuing alleged 
unfair banking practices 
it involves the ownership of 11 apartment buildings and 
residential hotels that house an estimated 1450 people 
the suit alleges that highland federal savings amp loan 
association and aampb loan co arranged exorbitant loans for decrepit 
buildings and extended credit to property owners with insufficient 
financial resources 
they lend to people who could never buy a house said 
barrett litt a public interest attorney who joined hahn and the 
legal aid foundation in filing the suit 
loans often were so huge that the revenues generated by tenants 
monthly rent went entirely for interest payments and the mortgage 
paid nothing toward the principal hahn said 
however hahn did not paint the landlords as victims of the 
lenders but as their coconspirators 
our evidence will show many instances of fraud and insider 
dealing in transfers that were designed to falsely inflate the 
value of property and subvert criminal prosecutions hahn said 
officials for the two loan companies did not immediately return 
telephone calls seeking comment 
the lawsuit names 135 companies and individuals who allegedly 
worked with the lenders by taking advantage of shell corporations 
or shelters to borrow large amounts of money against the slum 
buildings 
the suit charges the defendants with unfair business practices 
and alleges a number of violations committed against tenants 
including fraud conspiracy breaches of warranty and habitability 
and failure to abate a nuisance 
deborah dentler a legal aid attorney said tenants in most of 
the targeted buildings pay 350 to 550 a month for oneroom 
vermininfested apartments 
in one building she said toilets and showers were perpetually 
clogged and there were no light bulbs in hallways tenants must 
confront drug addicts cockroaches crawling over their children 
mice and deteriorating plumbing fixtures she said

the very wilderness that made prince 
william sound a rich habitat for birds marine mammals and fish is 
hindering efforts to retrieve animals contaminated by the nations 
biggest oil spill 
i dont want to encourage people by saying were going out to 
save all those birds pamela bergmann head of the us interior 
departments regional response team said tuesday its just not 
going to happen its even going to be tough to count the bodies 
a bird recovery center set up shortly after fridays 
101million gallon oil spill had not seen a single bird by 
tuesday afternoon bergmann said 
bergmann said beaches in many places are too rough for rescuers 
to land a boat let alone chase down and capture oilcoated birds 
the oil is spreading southwestward away from valdez where cleanup 
crews are based in the hours it takes for a bird to be captured 
and returned to valdez its chances of survival are greatly reduced 
even under favorable conditions rescue officials figure they 
are lucky if half the captured birds survive an oil spill alaskas 
chilly waters are likely to drive down the survival rate as 
oilcoated birds deprived of their insulating layer succumb to 
hypothermia 
some will sink theyll bash up against a cliff or eagles 
will pray on them bergmann said toxins in the oil pose a threat 
to the eagles and other predators she said 
a body count of dead birds is about all anyone can hope to 
accomplish said jon lyman alaska department of fish and game 
spokesman that count stood at fewer than 100 tuesday 
marine mammals such as sea otters also are at risk at least two 
dead otters have been spotted a dozen killer whales were seen 
surfacing in the slick during the weekend but officials said the 
oil does not pose as a great a danger to them 
rescue officials are discouraging volunteers who usually are an 
integral part of bird rescues in oil spills along more populated 
coastlines not only is the terrain more rugged but officials fear 
volunteers might not be prepared for encounters with the bears that 
prowl the sounds forested uninhabited islands 
bergmann said she has had to tell wouldbe volunteers that there 
is no place to stay in valdez no boats to take them out and little 
they can do 
environmental groups are growing impatient with the situation 
we have got to make the attempt not just sit here 
twiddling thumbs said cindy lowry alaska representative of 
greenpeace

prosecutors and police came under sharp 
criticism tuesday following dismissal of criminal charges against a 
mother and grandmother accused of forcing two young children into 
prostitution 
the case against katherine hubert 29 of el cerrito and glenda 
phillips 48 of concord fell apart when huberts children 
admitted they made up the story that has kept their mother in jail 
since january 24 
hubert remains charged with a single count of felony child 
endangerment the dropped charges carried possible prison terms of 
more than 400 years 
huberts 12yearold daughter had claimed she was forced to have 
sex more than 100 times with men while her 9yearold brother 
alleged he was made to perform more than 60 sexual acts with women 
municipal court judge bessie dreibelbis agreed to drop 58 of 59 
criminal counts against hubert and also dismissed the single 
pandering charge against phillips 
public defender oscar bobrow said refusal of the district 
attorneys office to drop the remaining count was outrageous 
and irresponsible 
whats going on is the district attorneys office is losing 
face bobrow said following mondays decision they need 
something to hold onto 
bobrow criticized the prosecutors office for filing unsupported 
charges and the police department for making several arrests in 
connection with the case 
however deputy district attorney pat sepulveda said the one 
remaining charge of child endangerment is not related to the 
prostitution allegations and is based on evidence of parental 
neglect and lack of supervision the children have been in foster 
homes since may 
hubert was released from jail monday night after she posted 
3000 bail a hearing on the lone charge is scheduled for 
wednesday 
while the tremendous inconvenience to all parties caused by 
these allegations is regrettable justice has been served by the 
early resolution of this case said district attorney gary yancey 
in a prepared statement 
yancey said the children had lied to prevent their mother from 
gaining custody of their two younger sisters ages 2 and 4 the 
childrens guardian told prosecutors last weekend that the children 
admitted concocting the prostitution story 
when the charges were filed both children had given consistent 
accounts in separate interviews one of the suspects had confessed 
to a molestation and medical evidence indicated they had been 
sexually abused said sepulveda 
charges against several people accused of being customers have 
been or will be dropped or reevaluated sepulveda said one man 
who had spent almost two months in jail was released friday 
prosecutors said 
police lt ray howard defended the departments handling of the 
case 
you cannot go into a crime investigation of this nature 
feeling the victims are lying to you howard said that belief 
coupled with the fact that we do have evidence that some sexual 
trauma did occur led us to make the investigation 
bobrow said hubert was delighted at the developments and that 
she had always contended the allegations were false

the extent of rebel influence on the balloting

287567 council members from more than 860000 candidates it

a judge tuesday disqualified the san diego yacht 
club as the winner in last years americas cup challenge and 
awarded the international sailing trophy to the defeated new 
zealand club 
state supreme court justice carmen ciparick said san diego 
violated the spirit of the race by using a 60foot catamaran to 
defend against the mercury bay boating clubs singlehulled yacht 
which is about 90 feet at the water line 
san diegos catamaran is the stars and stripes a 
multihulled boat that is lighter faster and more maneuverable 
than the new zealand 
skippered by dennis conner the san diego crew sailed to easy 
victory over the mercury bay club in waters off san diego last 
september 
calling the contest a gross mismatch the judge ordered the 
138yearold silver cup turned over to the new zealanders 
patrick goddard commodore of the san diego club said a 
decision on whether to file an appeal will be made in the next 
several days after the boards of the san diego yacht club and its 
event organizer the americas cup organizing committee are 
briefed by attorneys 
until that decision is made the cup will remain with the yacht 
club goddard said 
the leader of the new zealand syndicate michael fay expressed 
no surprise at the decision 
it had to come sooner or later he said from wellington new 
zealand we were always strong in our belief in what the cup 
meant and i think the cup has come through 
fay said the americas cup itself was the real winner and the 
ruling would be good for the integrity of the event 
in her 14page decision the judge said the court is mindful 
that forfeiture is a drastic remedy in the instance of a 
competition such as the americas cup with its large economic 
significance and prestige 
nonetheless the parties neither seek or suggest any 
alternative relief upon the disqualification of a competitor nor 
is any alternative relief feasible under the circumstances 
the judge said the 102yearold deed of gift which governs the 
race does not specify the size a boat must be or the number of 
hulls it must have 
but she said the conclusion is inescapable that george 
schuyler who established the race contemplated the defending 
vessel to relate in some way to the specifications of the 
challenger 
therefore ciparick said it is clear that a catamaran may not 
defend an americas cup competition against a monohull 
the cup was first won in 1851 by the yacht america in a race 
against several boats of the royal yacht club in england in 1857 
the america syndicate deeded the cup to the new york yacht club 
with a trust document establishing the competition and its terms 
the deed was revised by schuyler in 1882 and again in 1887 
the new york group kept the cup for 131 years before losing it 
to the royal perth yacht club of australia in 1983 at newport ri 
the san diego club led by conner won the americas cup in 1987 
in australia from the perth group 
the mercury bay group of auckland new zealand led by fay 
first came to court in july 1987 arguing it should be allowed to 
challenge san diego in a oneonone race for the cup in a boat 
larger than the 12meter yacht that had been used in americas cup 
contests since 1956 
the judge agreed on dec 21 1987 and ordered san diego to 
defend the cup against new zealand san diego was to use the 
12meter boat which runs about 45 feet at the waterline 
but conner instead decided to use a catamaran fay asked the 
judge to find san diego in contempt for preparing to sail such a 
vessel but she refused to bar the catamarans use 
after losing the san diego race fay asked ciparick to void the 
result 
in awarding the cup to the new zealanders the judge wrote 
it is hoped that further defendertrustees will place the 
interests of the cup and its spirit in a paramount position she 
wrote the court urges mercury bay to fulfill its obligations as 
trustee in the spirit of friendly competition that george l 
schuyler intended 
fay said talks would be held with the challenger of record the 
royal perth yacht club he said he expected challengers to gather 
in auckland new zealand in early 1991 with the finals in april 
while pleased with court judgment fay said he was still 
disappointed his boat did not win in the water 
that was the disappointment that we could never get that to 
happen san diego went off on a tangent if you can call it that 
and even when we asked them to delay the race they didnt seem to 
want to play the game he said

a woman prepared to cut her sons 
lifesupport system after a judge ruled tuesday that an assailant 
who may face murder charges if the youth dies did not have the 
right to stop her 
sylvia lane mother of victim mark weaver said her son had no 
wish to be kept alive artificially and she would remove his 
feeding tube on thursday 
noel pagan who served three years in prison for stabbing weaver 
in 1985 had gone to court to keep weaver alive because pagan could 
be charged with murder if the victim dies 
i dont know how any judge could not have ruled in our 
favor ms lane said i dont see how he could have any right 
to decide what happens to the victim of his crime 
pagan currently is on probation while serving a suspended 
sentence for the attack 
the state attorney generals office said it will not decide 
whether to file charges until after the death 
until theres a death theres no cause of death spokesman 
david cheever said tuesday 
robert mullen pagans attorney said his client had agreed 
that it was not in anybodys interest certainly not in the 
familys interest and not in mark weavers interest to appeal the 
ruling 
probate judge dana childs said pagans interest in preventing 
weavers death has nothing to do with the purposes of this 
proceeding 
mullen said he met monday with prosecutors to try to talk them 
out of filing additional charges 
pagan 29 stabbed weaver 26 on a lewiston street in 1985 and 
the victim lapsed into a coma when his neck wounds prevented oxygen 
from reaching his brain 
weaver who doctors say is in a permanent vegetative state 
has been under his mothers care at her portland home 
childs said feb 27 that ms lane was within her rights in 
removing her son from life support ms childs said at the time 
that she would do so on thursday

president roh taewoo ordered a major 
shakeup involving 49 senior generals after military hardliners 
criticized his failure to suppress dissidents officials and news 
reports said wednesday 
roh was reported replacing several rightwing hardliners in key 
security posts with generals loyal to him many senior commanders 
being retired or transferred to lesser posts were allies of former 
president chun doohwan 
a defense ministry spokesman who refused to be identified in 
keeping with official practice said a major shuffle was ordered in 
the armys high command he would not elaborate but details 
appeared in all seoul newspapers tuesday 
the shakeup had been expected next month it follows reports 
that hardliners in the government and military were unhappy with 
what they saw as rohs failure to curb antigovernment radicals and 
his efforts to build ties with communist nations 
a further shakeup of divisional commanders was expected to be 
announced in the coming weeks 
opposition parties said tuesday the realignment was needed to 
prevent military meddling in politics the army has been a major 
force in south korean politics and twice seized power in the 
nations 40year history 
roh a former general who won presidential elections in december 
1987 has tried to pursue a moderate policy and portray himself as 
a populist but the government has not won the broad support roh 
sought 
ministry officials said spring changes in the army high command 
were normal but the number of posts said to be involved was much 
larger than in routine shuffles 
indications of hardliner unhappiness with roh had been 
increasing administration minister kim yongkap quit the cabinet 
this month after attacking the government for not suppressing 
dissidents and radical students 
last week the commandant of the south korean military academy 
lt gen min byongdon failed to salute roh at graduation 
ceremonies and made a speech criticizing government efforts to 
establish ties with communist nations 
roh wants to ease the confrontation with communist north korea 
by building relations with its allies 
this week senior generals issued an unprecedented statement 
demanding that leading dissident moon ikhwan be punished for 
illegally visiting north korea moon reportedly met monday with 
north korean leader kim il sung to discuss reuniting the korean 
peninsula divided after world war ii 
the two koreas are bitter rivals and kim ordered the 1950 
invasion that started the korean war the seoul government said 
moon was trying to undermine its authority and warned he would be 
arrested if he returned home 
the government is reportedly split between hardliners demanding 
a harsh crackdown on dissidents and moderates loyal to roh who 
favor pragmatic and conciliatory policies 
chun roh and other senior generals took power with military 
backing in 1980 chun and roh were close allies but then roh 
distanced himself from chuns authoritarian rule in 1987 
the reports said 
lt gen koo changhwae called a roh loyalist will be 
appointed commander of the important capital garrison command 
responsible for military security in seoul he will replace lt 
gen kim jinyoung identified as a chun loyalist who will be 
moved to army combat school 
lt gen min head of the military academy who criticized roh 
would be retired 
lt gen na jungbae will be named deputy commander of the 
koreanus combined forces command which oversees most south 
korean troops and the 43000 us troops based in south korea a 
us general heads the command 
lt gen lee chinsam will be named head of the 1st army a 
major combat command 
roh loyalist maj gen cho nampung will be promoted to 
lieutenant general and kept on as head of military intelligence 
the defense security command

members of a us church group said tuesday they 
were lucky to escape alive from a machetewielding rockthrowing 
haitian mob that rushed their pickup truck on a crowded street near 
portauprince 
its a miracle we got out said roger mercer a member of 
the free methodist church in alpena mich who drove the truck 
it was obvious to me it was a planned attack because of the way 
they were prepared for us 
the 12 members of the church group involved in the sunday night 
incident all from northern michigan except for one floridian 
arrived at miami international airport on tuesday night 
mercer whose left eye was swollen shut and whose head and left 
foot were bandaged rolled off the plane in a wheelchair he said 
his brotherinlaw john freel who was in the passenger side of 
the pickup was shot in the arm louis haber of zephyrhills fla 
was knocked unconscious by a rock and others were hit by rocks but 
not seriously injured their vehicle was demolished he said 
the americans were treated at the st croix hospital in leogane 
a small town 18 miles southwest of portauprince 
the rev abner rabouin a haitian minister of the free methodist 
church said earlier in haiti that the the truck struck two 
haitians as it tried to maneuver through a crowd of about 1000 
revelers at a lenten celebration 
the minister said a rumor passed through the crowd that the 
truck was running down haitians provoking the mob attack rabouin 
said two haitians hit by the truck suffered broken legs 
mercer gave a harrowing account of the attack which came 
shortly after the group left a celebration at another town and were 
headed to gurim where the members were helping build a church 
the truck was inching through a huge crowd of revelers in the 
road when some men broke the trucks mirrors pounded on the hood 
and started throwing rocks at them mercer said at that point i 
knew i was in trouble he said 
mercer said another man was ready to heave a huge rock at the 
truck when he started to drive at him 
my objective was to get him off balance and it did just that 
i had no intention of hitting him he said adding that he 
wasnt sure if he struck the man 
when he tried to accelerate and escape mercer said another 
truck came from behind and cut off the church groups vehicle 
i rammed the truck from the rear spun him around and kept on 
going he recalled 
but another crowd of revelers ahead slowed the truck and the 
attack continued these machetes nearly carved the door off 
mercer said of the hourlong attack they were saying we were 
killers 
there were many angels there to protect them rabouin said 
otherwise they would have been killed 
elmore l clyde director of the free methodist churchs world 
missions headquartered at winona lake ind said the group was on 
a twoweek trip to build a church in leogane 
according to clyde the americans had gone to an easter service 
at another town and were returning to leogane when the attack 
occurred 
rabouin said haitians in a car that preceded the americans 
truck spread the rumor that the truck was deliberately running down 
people 
he called the rumor baseless and said the americans did 
everything they could to avoid hitting anyone 
he dismissed as abolutely untrue a report that occupants of 
the truck had pulled out revolvers and fired in the air 
rabouin said it took about two hours for the truck to arrive at 
a military outpost where the mob dispersed when a soldier fired 
into the air 
the free methodist church has operated a mission in haiti since 
1964 and has built 30 churches in the impoverished caribbean nation

once italian filmmakers dominated the worlds 
screens stars like sophia loren and anna magnani set hearts 
throbbing or tears flowing then came a rapid decline and the 
italian movie industry hit bottom there are signs of a 
renaissance however here is a report 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
in the dusty square a crowd of villagers stares 
wistfully at the movie palace that once brought them love and 
death its sign is chipped its facade blackened its windows 
smashed like broken teeth 
suddenly a demolition expert presses a switch and the theater 
explodes in a cloud of dust to make room for a parking lot 
the scene from the recent film new paradise cinema by 
giuseppe tornatore is intended to symbolize the death of italys 
once highly acclaimed cinema 
the image reflects the grim reality italian cinema has faced for 
more than a decade shrinking audiences shuttered theaters a drop 
in quality but although italian filmmaking remains troubled 
recent signs indicate that reports of its death may be exaggerated 
the italian cinema in the past two years has had a small 
recovery says carmine cianfarani president of the italian 
motion picture association we have huge possibilities at least 
on paper 
for years italians set the pace for moviemakers around the 
world roberto rossellini and vittorio de sica captured the 
brutality of life in neorealist films like open city and 
bicycle thief the 1960s brought the fantasy and metaphor of 
federico fellini michelangelo antonioni and pier paolo pasolini 
no one is predicting a quick return to those glory days but 
movie production is up for the third straight year after hitting an 
alltime low in 1985 and wellknown directors who had to scramble 
for financing are now being courted at home 
1989 began in a positive way cianfarani said all the 
major directors are at work from fellini to ettore scola from 
sergio leone to the taviani brothers from lina wertmuller to 
marco bellocchio 
in addition to the masters a younger generation of filmmakers 
is beginning to emerge after a long period in which italys 
directors were turning steadily grayer 
the reason for the flurry of activity is money coming from a 
host of television stations competing fiercely for the italian 
audience and hungry for films 
the possibilities have opened up incredibly with television 
said cristina comencini 35 a slender gingerhaired director the 
daughter of wellknown director luigi comencini she recently made 
her own debut with an acclaimed film the zoo 
theres a bigger circulation of money she said this has 
allowed many young people to make their first film 
but television is also seen as a mixed blessing many people 
fear its influence is lowering film quality and television is 
considered the main culprit in the collapse in movie attendance 
television in italy is destroying the cinema declares lino 
micciche a prominent film critic in the mid70s we sold 500 
million tickets now were under 100 million thats not a 
decrease its a disaster 
for most of this century the cinema was a focal point of life in 
italian cities and villages italians grew up laughing with the 
comedian toto crying with anna magnani lusting after sophia 
loren and being outraged by films like la dolce vita that 
portrayed the emptiness of their society 
this love of spettacolo spectacle gave italy the highest 
percapita movie attendance in the west and the biggest production 
of films after the united states 
but all that changed after italys constitutional court 
deregulated television in 1976 almost overnight new stations 
popped up all over the country television went from showing two 
movies a week in 1976 to a bewildering total of 2000 
our theaters have been emptied because the public could see 
too many films free at home above all italian ones complains 
silvio clementelli head of the national producers association 
the television explosion crippled an industry already hurting 
from the withdrawal of us producers who had flocked to italy in 
the 1960s to take advantage of special financial laws and produced 
blockbusters like ben hur and cleopatra 
with the financial squeeze production began to center on easy 
comedies pseudoamerican adventures and a handful of proven stars 
like marcello mastroianni or ornella muti many films were pushed 
out of theaters by technically superior american movies with big 
promotion budgets 
in italy you see very little italian film said luigi 
filippi a spokesman for the italian general association of 
entertainment 
the economic situation was so grim that bernardo bertolucci had 
to find a foreign producer and capital to make his oscarwinning 
the last emperor which was filmed in english in china 
but if television has caused a crisis it is providing some 
compensation competing stations particularly the staterun rai 
and magnate silvio berlusconis three commercial networks are now 
paying top dollar for the rights to films and often adding another 
chunk for a share of boxoffice profits 
one of the trickledown effects of their investment is growing 
attention to new filmmakers 
in the past year we have begun to talk about the socalled 
young italian cinema said micciche we are discovering that 
young peoples films do exist 
indeed in recent months three major films by new directors have 
come out its happening tomorrow by daniele luchetti 
massimo guglielmis rebus featuring charlotte rampling and 
mignon has come to stay by 28yearold francesca archibugi 
who gave birth to her first baby on the set 
other beginners like comencini and tornatore new paradise 
cinema are also winning acclaim even though their films are 
less widely distributed 
the road is still long for relatively unknown directors many 
have trouble getting their films into one of the dwindling number 
of theaters and with filmmaking depressed in recent years few 
bankable young stars have developed 
there arent any more sophia lorens said comencini all 
the great actors are of the older generation 
some observers say young directors also lack the inspiration 
provided by the idealistic postwar period or the 1960s 
this moment in italy is one of passage says micciche the 
young generation is unable to find new truths new ideals because 
the society doesnt know what they are we are so cynical 
while it has provided new opportunity the flood of television 
money may have drawbacks some directors are abandoning sweeping 
panoramas complicated plots and other things that dont adapt 
easily to television 
despite the problems producers and directors are hopeful that 
the small upturn will continue 
cinema may never be popular mass entertainment again thats 
what television is said comencini 
but its still an area where you can create new things 
different things

january was shot edited and transmitted not by news crews but 
by a video public relations agency 
if we do it right it looks like their own tape said gail 
cottman whose pro video news service produced the clip her 
10000 fee included contacting more than 100 television news 
outlets distributing the piece via satellite and making followup 
calls to see where it was broadcast 
parts of the story including the ships christening and an 
onboard interview with actor jimmy stewart screened on 
entertainment tonight and cnn it was retransmitted to more than 
500 local stations that take newsfeeds from abc cnn or group w 
pro video reported 
as television news expands more public relations agencies are 
moving past typewritten press releases and still photos they 
target tv newsrooms with videocassette news releases and 
promotional tape available via satellite 
the most interesting things i see companies doing is putting 
up satellite feeds on the day of an event they put it up there for 
people to grab said cbs news west coast bureau manager jennifer 
siebens 
when honda offered visuals of its first usmanufactured cars 
being shipped to japan from portland ore ms siebens passed up 
the reverseimport story if we took their feed we would be 
conceding total control of the story to the subject of the story 
she said 
such ethical concerns divide news directors some argue against 
ever using promotional clips within newscasts others use them but 
identify who supplied them and still others broadcast the clips on 
newscasts without any hint to viewers as to who supplied them 
there is absolutely no consensus among our members said 
ernie schultz president of the radiotelevision news directors 
association in washington dc weve got 1200 news directors 
and 1200 positions everybody is different 
we believe that if we do a story the viewer should be 
confident that whatever hes seeing is 100 percent cbs news that 
we have been there as an independent set of eyes on the story 
said ms siebens 
sometimes news directors have little choice a few months ago 
cbs and other networks showed drexel burnham lambert chief 
executive frederick h joseph reacting to the firms settlement of 
alleged federal securitieslaw violation 
but joseph wasnt interviewed or taped by news staffers 
instead his comments were issued as a video press release in the 
late afternoon by drexel cbs noted the source when it broadcast 
the edited tape 
ms siebens said cbs identifies publicity videos for viewers 
such as file footage of a factory assembly line cbs newsfeeds 
likewise identify sources for the local stations receiving them 
but ms siebens doesnt know if stations pass the identifications 
along to viewers 
radiotelevision news directors association ethics dont require 
newscasters to mention if the tapes were supplied by the subject 
being mentioned only that stations dont pass off tapes as their 
own 
we are not prepared to say that every time that you put 
something on the air that you have not originated that you have to 
name the source said schultz the strength of our position is 
that every editor uses his or her own judgment 
but broadcasting clientsupported videos on news shows blurs the 
line between publicity and news critics contend publicity videos 
allow companies to put their best visual foot forward avoid 
questions from probing reporters and promote story angles favorable 
to their products 
if they try to push anything corporate or push a product 
were not going to take it said jake wirtshafter a news 
assistant with abc network news in los angeles who fields 
publicists messages he said they are lucky to get three items a 
month on one of our network feeds 
a reporter can take information from a public relations piece 
and sort it out said wirtshafter but once we put it up we 
cant do that if we show something that makes their client look 
good we cant balance it out 
cottman averages two clientsupported releases a week she 
produces both video news releases with narration that stations can 
air as their own as well as news tapes without sound for which 
stations can provide their own narration from information provided 
by pro video 
in five minutes of tape the station gets everything it 
needs said cottman they can deal with the story as they 
choose to show it

challenges in melding the fundamental tenets of his church and the

yesterday the missionaries christianized 
africa today the blacks are africanizing christianity 
cardinal joseph malula of zaire 
when pope john paul ii makes his fifth journey to africa april 
28may 6 he will address a roman catholic flock that has grown by 
22 million since his first trip in 1980 
the popes fourstop trip madagascar the french territory 
reunion in the mascarene islands zambia and malawi dramatizes 
his resolve to stimulate the fastest growing segment of his church 
from a tiny european missionary movement a century ago the 
catholic church in africa has become a powerful indigenous 
institution of 75 million adherents the vatican expects their 
numbers will increase to 100 million by the year 2000 
it is safe to say that in no other continent during the last 
50 years has christianity shown so much growth and diversity such 
a cheerful but perplexing flood of people confidently doing their 
own thing often in seemingly strange and contradictory ways 
wrote adrian hastings in his book african christianity 
the churchs influence extending far beyond the number of its 
followers is especially felt in education many of todays african 
leaders are products of missionary schools including the 
jesuiteducated robert mugabe the marxist president of zimbabwe 
africans also play an increasingly influential role at the 
vatican underlined by the growth in the number of african 
cardinals from one to 17 in the past 30 years two of the cardinals 
are based in rome including bernardin gantin of benin head of the 
powerful congregation of bishops 
african prelates have also made their presence felt in worldwide 
church affairs at the 1987 synod of bishops in rome on the role of 
the laity african bishops led the way in blocking proposals by 
us bishops to allow women to serve in nonordained ministries 
but the african church also faces special problems namely in 
trying to adapt african traditions to a faith imported from europe 
while upholding its laws on polygamy superstition and priestly 
celibacy 
the african church is also increasingly worried about the spread 
of islamic fundamentalism in countries such as sudan and nigeria 
other churchstate difficulties include conflict with the 
marxist government in mozambique and tensions with south africa 
over apartheid which the vatican recently called the most 
systematic form of racism in the world 
in spite of the problems africa appears as a source of joyful 
hope for the church the vatican missionary agencys information 
bulletin said in its 1988 review of missionary activity around the 
world 
that assessment is certainly shared by the pope who visited 20 
countries during his african pilgrimages in 1980 1982 1985 and 
1988 
in january john paul announced a special synod of africas 480 
bishops to discuss various issues facing the church saying he 
hoped the assembly would further bolster the faith of those 
beloved people to whom i feel so close the date and site of the 
synod have not yet been fixed 
in another sign of the churchs expanding presence in africa 
the ivory coast is building a huge basilica only slightly smaller 
than st peters in rome at a cost of at least 130 million 
vatican officials however say the pope has no plans to attend its 
inauguration later this year some have interpreted this as a show 
of disapproval of a display of opulence 
a dominant issue for the church has been the process of 
africanization incorporating traditional african customs and 
culture in church services liturgy teaching theology music and 
art 
this movement grew out of the reforms of the second vatican 
council in 196265 and drew inspiration from the encyclical on 
the evangelization of peoples by pope paul vi who made the first 
papal visit to africa in 1969 
the missionaries who evangelized africa provided churches 
schools and hospitals but they often showed disdain for african 
culture 
vatican officials say the church in recent years has gone a long 
way in adopting the use of tribal drums native dance music and 
the vernacular liturgy 
the pope has frequently encouraged the trend but stressed that 
the basic foundations of faith and teaching cannot be compromised 
you are certainly aware of a danger that of allowing the 
growth of a philosophy and a theology of africanism that would be 
exclusively of native origin and lacking any real and profound 
connection with christ he told visiting bishops from zaire in 
1983 
one persistent problem has been polygamy a practice outlawed by 
the church but still common in much of africa during the popes 
tour of southern africa last september he lectured the 20yearold 
king of swaziland and his four wives that family stability is based 
on monogamy

the church has also been hard pressed to interpret the 
relationship between superstition and religion in a continent where 
some church ministers have been accused of practicing witchcraft 
and voodoo 
the primate of zambia archbishop emmanuel milingo was recalled 
to rome in 1982 because of his faithhealing practices he was 
relieved of his position in zambia and assigned to a lowranking 
roman curia post 
according to the latest church statistics africa has the 
highest number of catechists religion teachers in the world 
216000 but it has only 18000 priests less than 8 percent of the 
total in europe 
officials say the shortage of priests is partly due to the 
churchs insistence on celibacy which runs contrary to the stress 
on family and children in african culture 
to illustrate the dilemma a vatican official recounted how an 
african cardinal was scolded by rome for proposing three candidates 
for bishop all of whom had fathered children the cardinal wrote 
back to the vatican finding angels is your job 
on a political level the role and influence of the church often 
depends on its size in each country ranging from catholic 
strongholds such as zaire burundi and rwanda to sierra leone where 
they are latecomers in a moslem majority 
the pope and the african church have often spoken out against 
human rights violations and called for peace reconciliation and 
negotiations to settle various civil wars and conflicts 
this sometimes places the church in an adversary role in 
mozambique for example the church was rebuked for urging direct 
peace talks with rightwing rebels 
in burundi three years ago the government nationalized some 
seminaries banned catholic youth groups and shut down catechism 
classes on grounds that the church was trying to discredit the 
nation the situation has improved since a military takeover in 
1987 church officials say 
while islam has always been a main challenger for converts 
moslem fundamentalism comes as a more recent threat to the church 
the vatican review of missionary activity listed fanatical 
propaganda on the part of groups of radical moslems as one of the 
churchs main challenges in africa 
it specifically named sudan where the moslemdominated 
government in the north is fighting christian rebels in the south 
and nigeria where it saw dangerous tension and violence created 
by islamic fanatics 
fundamentalists in sudan and nigeria favor islamic law the 
vatican criticized its imposition on nonmoslems in a major 
document on racism published in february 
nigerias cardinal francis arinze president of the vaticans 
office for relations with nonchristians said in a recent 
interview with the italian catholic monthly 30 giorni 30 days 
it is true that in some african countries especially among young 
converts people dont understand why the church dedicates so much 
time and effort to dialogue with moslems when islam in their own 
country appears so little disposed to dialogue i understand the 
difficulties of these christians and in a certain way i can say 
they are right 
one of the harshest public attacks on the church came from 
libyas col moammar gadhafi 
africa is not christian he declared during a visit to 
rwanda in 1982 christians are intruders to africa christians 
are agents of colonialism you must wage a holy war so that islam 
may spread in africa god willing islam will triumph in africa 
over the religion of colonialism christianity

africa got its first native cardinal 29 
years ago today it has 17 including the head of one of the most 
powerful posts at the vatican 
cardinal bernardin gantin of benin 66 is prefect of the 
congregation of bishops which directs the worlds 4000 roman 
catholic bishops and plays a major role in the selection of bishops 
under the guidelines of pope john paul ii 
gantin who has held the position since 1984 and is the first 
black prelate to head a major vatican office has been mentioned as 
a possible papal candidate 
the other vaticanbased african cardinal is francis arinze of 
nigeria who runs the office for relations with nonchristians an 
important issue in africa where many catholics live sidebyside 
with moslems 
another prominent african prelate at the vatican is archbishop 
emmanuel milingo the former primate of zambia who was recalled to 
rome in 1982 and stripped of his native post because of controversy 
over his alleged faithhealing practices he now has a post with 
the vatican office for migration and tourism 
pope john xxiii named the first black african cardinal laurean 
rugambwa of tanzania in 1960 
the number of african cardinals has gradually increased under 
john paul who last spring elevated three more prelates in 
mozambique cameroon and mauritius 
all the african cardinals are black except for those from 
algeria and south africa 
most of africas 480 bishops are black reflecting the steady 
africanization of the church a process encouraged by the pope 
it is not the church imported from outside he said after 
his first visit in 1980 it is their church the church lived 
authentically in an african way

once again capitol hill is bracing for a 
bitter legislative battle over control of the nations sugar bowl 
as usual on a noisy battlefield its sometimes difficult to tell 
the good guys from the bad guys 
supporters of the current federal sugar policy which includes 
protective quotas on imports of cheaper foreign sugar and price 
guarantees for american producers are heartened by the bush 
administrations views so far 
but the newest assault is just starting and is expected to 
intensify as congress begins to develop legislation to replace the 
1985 farm law when it expires next year 
current sugar policy was set by the 1981 farm law and reafirmed 
in the 1985 legislation the reagan administration had 
unsuccessfully sought basic changes in the sugar program but 
bushs people so far have indicated a holding pattern 
for example the american sugar alliance which say it backs 
americas beet cane and corn farmers in the struggle 
applauded when agriculture secretary clayton yeutter said during 
his senate confirmation hearing that the admininstration is not 
about to make major changes here in sugar policy until and unless 
other countries make them 
were not going to unilaterally disarm in sugar any more than 
were going to unilaterally disarm in anything else yeutter 
said we absolutely cannot do so until our major trading partners 
are prepared to deal with the market distortions that they 
provide in sugar throughout the world 
but some consumer advocates and lobbyists want changes in the 
present sugar law particularly a reduction in the price supports 
guaranteed domestic producers of cane and beet sugar 
sen william v roth jr rdel and sen bill bradley dnj 
have introduced legislation that would overhaul the sugar program 
including a reduction in the government price support loan rate for 
raw sugar to 12 cents per pound over the next four years from the 
current 18 cents 
the bill also would set a floor on sugar imports and would 
increase those floors annually by 500000 tons 
like other agricultural subsidies the price support for our 
domestic sugar production has bloated the market says roth 
this legislation will save the consumer who now pays almost 
three times the world market price of sugar 3 billion annually in 
sweetener purchases at the grocery store 
the rothbradley measure is identical to one introduced in the 
house by reps thomas downey dny and willis gradison rohio 
leading the support for an overhaul of the sugar program is the 
sweetener users association which represents industrial users of 
sugar and other sweeteners 
tom hammer president of the association says recent consumer 
price reports show a rapid rise in sugar costs and adds that this 
could have been headed off by a less protectionist us sugar 
policy 
the us sugar subsidy program has failed to maintain stable 
prices hammer says domestic sugar growers are completely 
insulated no matter how low the market price may fall the rest of 
us consumers and industrial users have no protection whatsoever 
from phenomenal increases in sugar prices 
hammer said the current program is mandated by the 1985 farm 
law which says the program must operate at no cost to the 
federal government as a result costs are passed on to consumers 
as a hidden tax estimated to be in excess of 3 billion a year 
eiler c ravnholt chairman of the proprogram american sugar 
alliance says the price of sugar on the world market is an 
inaccurate inappropriate and unfair standard by which to compare 
us costs and needs 
ravnholt who also is vice president of the hawaiian sugar 
planters association says the current program does what it was 
designed to do assure the survival of the domestic sweetener 
industry and provide consumers with plentiful supplies at 
reasonable prices 
in the 1985 law he said congress once again recognized that 
protecting the american sugar producer from unbridled foreign 
competition remained a historic necessity it is the nature of the 
world sugar market which has made protection essential and which is 
the basis for continuing the support by the us government 
rekha mehra a policy analyst at resources for the future a 
nonprofit independent washingtonbased research institution 
says us sugar producers have had a varying degree of government 
support for almost 200 years but that reform cannot be avoided 
much longer 
the current program includes a price support loan for sugar and 
a market stabilization price or msp as with other commodity 
programs sugar processors can get the loan rate by committing raw 
can sugar or refined beet sugar as collateral 
if prices are favorable the processor can repay the loan and 
sell the crop commercially if not the sugar is forfeited to the 
governments commodity credit corp which must store and dispose 
of the surplus the 1985 farm law however said the program must

the minimum price support was set at 18 cents per pound for cane 
sugar with beet sugar somewhat higher in relation to the cane 
rate and one of the effects of the higher price for beet sugar has 
been to stimulate production would prefer to sell raw sugar 
commercially rather than forfeit it to the government basically 
the msp is the support level plus allowances for interest freight 
and a small marketing incentive 
but mehra added the key instrument enabling the program to 
function without cost to the government is still the import 
quota by adjusting how much cheaper foreign sugar can enter the 
united states the market price is kept at or above the msp 
by far the largest group of losers from the us sugar program 
is consumers she said they pay more both for direct sugar 
consumption and for sugarcontaining products

peter v ueberroth the financial wizard who 
made millions for the olympics and baseball is discussing a 
purchase of strikebound eastern airlines the associated press 
learned monday 
an offer from ueberroth may be presented to the board of 
directors of eastern parent texas air corp in the next few days 
airline industry and baseball sources said on condition of 
anonymity ueberroths term as baseball commissioner ends saturday 
i know peters been trying to put together a group to 
finance a purchase of eastern one source said 
ueberroth did not wish to comment on the matter his spokesman 
rich levin said here monday night 
eastern spokesman robin matell contacted for comment at his 
miami home said ive heard about it but we just dont comment 
on rumors 
texas airs board is holding a regularly scheduled meeting 
tuesday and wednesday said a source close to the company 
texas air spokesman art kent in houston said the company would 
have no comment on the matter 
there are a lot of those rumors going around kent said 
if and when any agreement is reached to sell eastern im sure all 
the parties involved will issue a statement 
ueberroth was approached last fall by officials of easterns 
unions to consider taking over the troubled airline which filed 
for bankruptcy protection march 9 five days after the start of a 
machinists union strike that was supported by airline pilots 
the unions have said they would make concessions if ueberroth 
took over possibly in return for ownership of part of the airline 
telephone calls for comment to the office of the machinists 
local for eastern in miami and union officials were not answered 
monday night 
since the strike began eastern has been flying only about 10 
percent of its normally scheduled 1040 flights most of those 
flights have been on the shuttle between new york and boston and 
washington and on its latin american routes 
ueberroth met with eastern officials during baseballs winter 
meetings in atlanta last december then traveled to miami for 
further talks a baseball source said in addition ueberroth and 
california investor kirk kerkorian have discussed a possible buyout 
with texas air chairman frank lorenzo a source said 
however another source said it was not clear whether kerkorian 
was involved 
minneapolis banker carl r pohlad who owns baseballs minnesota 
twins is a director of texas air and owns 12 percent of jet 
capital corp texas airs holding company lorenzo owns 487 
percent of jet capital pohlad reportedly brought ueberroth in to 
negotiate the purchase of the airline 
pohlad and other texas air directors have urged lorenzo to sell 
eastern since the strike began sources said at the time of the 
bankruptcy filing eastern had about 300 million in cash and was 
losing about 4 million a day according to papers filed with us 
bankruptcy court in new york 
kerkorian who is a friend of ueberroths is majority owner of 
mgmua communications co last fall mgm pictures inc a 
subsidiary offered to hire ueberroth as chief executive officer 
but ueberroth turned down the deal 
kerkorian also owns mgm grand air a firstclassonly airline 
that flies primarily between new york and los angeles 
a call to kerkorians los angeles office asking for comment was 
not returned 
a bid by ueberroth could compete for easterns attention against 
an offer by takeover strategist carl icahn who has publicly 
expressed interest and has been supported by easterns unions 
icahn is chairman and owner of trans world airlines inc 
ueberroth 51 is known as an ironwilled administrator who 
talked down to foreign officials during his five years as president 
of the los angeles olympic organizing committee and then bullied 
baseballs owners 
the 1984 los angeles olympics expected to lose money or at best 
break even made 230 million 
he was elected baseball commissioner in march 1984 and took 
office that october baseball lost money for 11 consecutive years 
before he took office but then made 209 million in his four full 
seasons according to financial statements obtained by the ap 
during his time in baseball ueberroth stayed active in 
business he is a director of several major corporations and as a 
board member of ef hutton inc engineered the companys sale to 
shearson lehman brothers inc earning 850000 in fees 
ueberroth was vice president of trans international airlines for 
two years when in 1963 he founded a small travel agency in southern 
california eventually he built first travel corp into the 
secondlargest business of its kind in north america

strong winds monday delayed efforts to 
control a huge oil spill in prince william sound and the president 
of exxon shipping said the company was a little overwhelmed by 
the magnitude of the cleanup 
federal investigators piecing together the sequence of events 
leading up to the spill said they planned to interview the captain 
and other bridge officers of the tanker exxon valdez 
the captain joseph hazelwood was not on the bridge when the 
vessel left shipping lanes to avoid ice rammed a charted reef and 
ran aground early friday the third mate who did not have proper 
certification was in charge exxon shipping co president frank 
iarossi said 
investigators said at a news conference that the results of drug 
and alcohol tests on crew members will be made public when 
officials receive them possibly in two or three days 
hazelwood of huntington ny has had drinking problems in the 
past according to reports 
yes theres a previous history going back five years or 
more iarossi said sunday in response to reporters questions 
about alcohol abuse by hazelwood personally what happened five 
years ago to somebody is not germane to this accident 
however the new york times reported tuesday that hazelwood was 
convicted last september in new hampshire of drunken driving and 
that his license was revoked a second time 
the new york department of motor vehicles said his license 
remains revoked 
in 1984 hazelwood was arrested in suffolk county ny on long 
island on a drunken driving charge two sources connected with law 
enforcement who spoke on condition of anonymity told the associated 
press 
hazelwood pleaded guilty in 1985 to driving while intoxicated 
and received a conditional discharge and a fine of about 510 the 
sources said under a conditional discharge a persons criminal 
record is cleared if there are no other arrests over a certain 
period 
suffolk county police officer peter kelley confirmed the 
essential details of the sources account 
hazelwoods license was revoked then but was restored in 1986 
after he completed a state program the times said 
telephone calls to hazelwoods home monday were not answered 
a national transportation safety board spokewoman in washington 
dc said hazelwood third mate quartermaster and bridge lookout 
are among those who will be questioned 
ntsb officials said it was questionable whether the drug and 
alcohol tests will be of much value 
drucella anderson an ntsb spokeswoman said there were 
indications the tests may have been administered as long as 10 
hours after the accident 
i dont know how good the tests will be said rachel 
halterman another spokeswoman for the ntsb in washington the 
board plans to open a formal inquiry in anchorage sometime in the 
next three weeks 
the 987foot tanker carrying 12 million barrels of north slope 
crude oil apparently struck a glancing blow against a rock kept 
going and hit rocks a second time then ran aground iarossi said 
about 240000 barrels spilled through the hull creating an oil 
slick that has since covered about 100 square miles according to 
the coast guard the oil is slowly heading south toward the gulf of 
alaska but must pass numerous islands before it reaches open sea 
at about 101 million gallons the spill is the biggest such 
accident on record in the united states 
the spill closed the port of valdez the southern terminus of 
the alaska pipeline and crude oil prices rose sharply on monday 
meanwhile gusts up to 50 mph idled most aircraft including one 
that was to spray chemicals to break up the oil slick 
four to sixfoot waves whipped the slick into a frothy mix that 
coast guard cmdr steve mccall called chocolate mousse 
the spreading oil stained another island as it stretched 40 
miles southwest of bligh reef the beaches on at least three 
islands just got clobbered mccall said 
as the oil washes into inlets along the islands it poses a 
greater danger to animals and microorganisms but also will make 
cleanup easier mccall said 
and as the oil gets whipped up chemical dispersants may no 
longer be useful mccall said instead cleanup crews intend to 
rely on containment booms and skimmers and burning 
iarossi said the wind damaged some of the containment booms used 
to corral the oil including some around the stricken tanker 
the vessel remained stuck on bligh reef about 25 miles from 
valdez iarossi said the wind pivoted the ship 12 degrees to the 
north and that the crew said the new position felt much more 
stable 
workers continued pumping operations to remove the 1 million 
barrels of oil left on board the exxon valdez by monday evening 
about 120000 barrels had been transferred to the exxon baton 
rouge iarossi said exxon hoped to have about 95 percent of the 
remaining oil off the vessel in three or four days 
he said he cannot guarantee that all the oil will be removed 
from the tanker nor that all of the slick will be cleaned up 
frankly we are a little overwhelmed iarossi said we 
still have a major problem ahead of us but we feel we are 
gaining 
mccall said the port of valdez will be reopened to limited 
traffic tuesday to get to the port vessels will have to operate 
outside normal shipping channels to avoid the spill he said 
to help them steer through unfamiliar waters ships will be 
required to take on local pilots farther offshore than normal he 
said 
nearly a dozen oil tankers were anchored more than 30 miles from 
valdez waiting to be allowed in 
the alyeska pipeline service co has reduced the normal daily 
flow in the transalaska oil pipeline from 2 million barrels to 
about 800000 barrels because of limited storage capacity in 
valdez the port has been closed since the exxon tanker ran aground 
gov steve cowper was critical of the time it took exxon and 
alyeska pipeline service co to begin the cleanup alyeska operates 
the oilloading terminal at valdez 
people should have anticipated such a spill as this cowper 
said at a news conference in juneau 
fishermen held a news conference earlier in the day to complain 
that exxon was not taking adquate steps to warn cleanup workers and 
nearby villagers about the health threat from the oil and new plans 
to burn it with jelled gasoline 
a spokeswoman for the cordova district fishermens union said 
use of chemicals to disperse the oil is accceptable only under 
limited conditions and that burning the oil should be ruled out 
the fishing industry objected to the two methods on 
environmental grounds but iarossi said conventional methods such 
as containment booms and skimmers are inadequate to deal with such 
a large spill 
a man from tatitlek said many of the nearby villages 100 
residents suffered nausea and severe headaches after burn tests 
were conducted last week 
the whole village is getting sick said norman vlasoff 
cowper declared prince william sound ordinarily teeming with 
fish marine mammals and birds a disaster area he said he would 
seek federal money to help with the spill 
pamela bergman a spokeswoman for the us department of 
interior said at least 90 contaminated birds and two sea otters 
had been spotted but wildlife officials feared there were many 
more that went undetected she said 
i think sorting out the money is something that will occupy 
lawyers for years to come cowper said adding that alyeska and 
exxon should share the blame and all costs and that damages should 
include any loss of income suffered by fishermen

more than 33000 nuclear plant mishaps 
ranging from stuck valves to radioactive leaks have been reported 
by utilities to the nuclear regulatory commission in the 10 years 
since the partial meltdown at three mile island according to a 
study released today 
a decade after the accident at three mile island the nand the 
nuclear industry have forgotten the lesson of tmi saan 
claybrook president of publcitizen the advocacy group whicred the 
report the plants pose a continuing danger to the publics 
health and safety 
but nrc spokesman joseph fouchard who characterized the study 
as pinging the industry said nuclear powerlants are safer than 
they were ago 
there have been fewer challenges to the system fewer 
automatic shutdowns the amount of waste geneed at these plants has 
gone down theyre cleaner and the amount of cumulative radiation 
exposure to employees has gone down fouchard said all of the 
fety indicators are going in a positive direction 
the study nuclear power safety 19791989 chartsincrease 
at the beginning of the decade in the ner of reported nuclear plant 
mishaps these are or breakdowns of plant systems and procedures 
which may pose a threat to public safety the operating 
utilitycidents to the nrc by filing a licensee event report or 
lethe nrc has a system for grading the severity ofc citizen did not 
take this into account 
in 1979 there were 2310 reported mishaps at the nations 67 
nuclear reactors including the partial meltdown r increased to 
3804 in 1980 to 4060 in 1981 and to 4500 in 1982 by 1983 e 
number of reported incidents exceeded 5000 at 82 operating plants 
the group found 
in 1984 however the nrc changed its system for reporting such 
events and the tonumber of lers dropped to 2460 that year 
according to public citizen 1985 with 3050 lers was described 
by the nrc as one of the worst years in the history of the nuclear 
power industrarked by 645 emergency plant shutdowns and 38 fines 
totaling nearly 4 million levied against utilities 
since then the number of nuclear plant mishaps has apparently 
leveled off although even the nrcs data is incomplete and thus 
these figures probably do not reflect the entmishaps each year 
the report said 
for example in 1984 the first year that the new repting 
requirements were in effect the nrc estimated that betweeent of 
reportable mishaps were not reported the study said 
if the nrcs assessment is correct the ler counsimply reflects 
the mishaps which the industry chooses to report while the actual 
number of poy significant safety events may be much higher 
public citize the number of lers has remaine relatively constant 
since 198560 in 1986 and 2955 in 1987 incomplete data for 1988 
reveled 2296 mishaps at the nations 108 licensedtooperate 
reactors 
total mishaps for the 10 years 33475 
the report is findings from public citizens annual nuclear 
power safety reports and preliminary data being e groups 
forthcoming 1988 report the data were obtained under information

a 59 million telephone rate cut and 138 
million refund ordered by state regulators prompted gte corps 
general telephone southwest to annouce it will eliminate about 600 
jobs in texas and defer filling 400 vacancies 
in addition a spokesman from gtes corporate headquarters in 
stamford conn said monday the cutback means the regional 
division will put off plans to relocate the headquarters of its 
telephone operations division 
al galletly a gte spokesman in stamford said the reassessment 
of the 40 million headquarters decision was for financial reasons 
and declined to comment when asked if it was in retaliation for the 
rate decision 
plans called for about 2500 gte employees to be relocated to 
the north dallas area by the end of 1989 with another 1500 hired 
locally or transferred from other facilities by the projects 
completion 
el buddy langley president of general telephone 
southwest said that in addition to cutting regular employees the 
phone company will release more than 100 people who are working for 
gte as contractors and reduce its capital investment budget by more 
than 100 million 
he said the company would defer or eliminate further 
modernization of its telephone switching centers and networks in 
texas that had been scheduled for completion in 1989 
the company also will abandon plans for buying another facility 
in irving for 40 reduce vehicle orders 5 million and defer or 
reduce expenses for training building repairs and other items by 
up to 3 million he added 
langley said gte has petitioned for a rehearing of the public 
utility commission rate decision and that a hearing on the motion 
is set for april 5 in austin 
the puc in february voted to lower gte southwests rates by 59 
million and require the telephone company to refund 138 million to 
customers over two years 
the refund resulted because the commission set the effective 
date of the rates retroactively to jan 1 1987 
gte had requested an 814 million rate increase 
gte southwest said the commission failed to recognize its 
aggressive efforts to improve service and modernize and that 
could have a chilling effect on future utility investment in 
the state 
a 59 million annual reduction would decrease residential rates 
by an average of more than 17 percent according to puc figures 
gte southwest serves 12 million residential and business 
customers in texas arkansas oklahoma and new mexico

several hundred salaried general motors corp 
workers are trying to block a proposed racial discrimination 
settlement calling it inadequate 
about 600 employees met monday to discuss their dissatisfaction 
and sign petitions asking us district judge john feikens to 
refuse to approve the settlement feikens had asked members of the 
suit to respond to the settlement by march 31 
the recent settlement would cover more than 10000 current and 
former salaried workers in michigan ohio and indiana who sued the 
automaker in 1983 claiming they were denied raises and promotions 
given to white colleagues with similar jobs 
the offer could cost the automaker 20 million to 40 million 
attorneys said it includes payments to former employees and raises 
for some current gm workers 
gm would acknowledge no wrongdoing under the proposed settlement 
the settlement is entirely totally inadequate said 
napoleon quick a leader of concerned black salaried employees 
which organized mondays meeting 
members of the group said the settlement among other things 
doesnt provide money for damages or lost salary which affects

federal officials hailed a cash 
settlement between the government and unisys corp on fraud 
charges but the nations second largest computer company said it 
felt vindicated by the dismissal of charges 
us attorney james wilson announced monday that unisys made a 
700000 payment to the government in return for federal 
authorities throwing out the indictment 
the charges last october against unisys and its predecessor 
sperry corp stemmed from a 526 million contract to upgrade the 
air forces worldwide computer system it followed a fouryear 
investigation by authorities 
as part of the settlement the company also agreed to abandon a 
claim against the government by sperry for more than 800000 in 
disputed unpaid invoices wilson said 
we feel this is an overall victory an outstanding victory 
he said about the settlement 
convictions in the case would only have resulted in maximum 
fines of 50000 wilson said he said the settlement was not an 
admission of guilt on the part of the companies 
a spokesman for unisys said the settlement was a business 
decision reached to avoid continuing litigation and the company 
continued to deny any wrongdoing j peter hynes said the dismissal 
of charges vindicates the company 
we have said all along that there was no criminality 
involved said hynes in a telephone interview from the companys 
blue bell pa headquarters 
he said the settlement was just a convenience to get the whole 
situation behind us and continue working with the air force which 
is a valuable customer 
unisys and sperry were accused of overcharging the government in 
1983 for an unspecified portion of a 500000 invoice involving the 
computer contract 
unisys was formed as a result of a merger of burroughs corp and 
sperry in september 1986 
wilson said uncertainty about the criminal liability of 
successor corporations following mergers played a part in the 
government choosing to settle government prosecutors appealed 
after us district judge joel dubina dismissed the case against 
unisys in december because the company did not exist until 1986 
in the settlement filed march 21 dubinas dismissal order was 
thrown out as part of the legal work leading to the agreement to 
drop charges against both companies 
the death of a key government witness also was a factor in 
dismissing the indictment wilson said

oil prices receded slightly this morning one 
day after a major alaskan oil spill incited a rally that pushed 
crude to the highest level in 19 months 
traders attributed the decline partly to profittaking and 
uncertainty about the longterm impact of the spill which forced 
the temporary closure of an important oilloading port 
they also said more uncertainty about prices and supplies was 
raised by the start of an organization of petroleum exporting 
countries meeting this morning in vienna austria 
the price of the may contract for west texas intermediate oil 
the benchmark us crude fell to 2020 a barrel on the new york 
mercantile exchange on monday the contract rose 38 cents a barrel 
to close at 2053 
it was the highest nearmonth closing price for the key grade 
since aug 14 1987 when it closed at 2057 
refined products traded on the mercantile exchange also weakened 
in price after sharp runups monday the april contract for unleaded 
gasoline fell 068 cent a gallon this morning to 5907 cents and 
home heating oil fell 083 cent a gallon to 5675 cents 
the price surge stemmed largely from the accident off the 
alaskan port of valdez where an exxon corp tanker ran aground 
spilling an estimated 101 million gallons of crude oil into prince 
william sound 
the accident forced the closing of the port the southern 
terminus of the alaska pipeline that carries all crude oil from 
alaskas north slope 
the shutdown temporarily cut us crude supplies by a quarter 
and it was this development that incited heavy buying of energy 
futures 
the markets reaction was a little overdone despite the 
interruption in north slope supplies said madison galbraith 
senior energy specialist with merrill lynch energy futures

in a drive to modernize its fleet trans world 
airlines inc announced plans today to buy up to 40 jets from 
airbus industrie in a deal worth more than 36 billion 
it was one of the biggest orders for new aircraft and followed 
multibillion dollar purchases announced recently by american 
airlines and delta air lines 
twa chairman carl icahn said the airline will place firm orders 
for 20 a330300 twinengine widebody aircraft and take options on 
an additional 20 
airbus a consortium backed by britain france west germany and 
spain will begin delivering the 301seat aircraft to twa in late 
1994 or early 1995 depending on engine selection 
commenting on the deal in a prepared statement icahn said 
this concludes an aircraft evaluation study begun more than two 
years ago and reaffirms our commitment to twas longterm growth 
and prosperity 
the airbus jets are being purchased under a fleet renewal 
program aimed at replacing twas l1011 and 747100 aircraft he 
said twa intends to operate the a330 on major north american and 
transatlantic routes 
the a330 which offers the most advanced technology available 
today also gives us the option to expand the airline to take 
advantage of market opportunities icahn said

nonsense said the professor pure myth the 
myth of the green eyeshade 
he was referring to repeated stories in the business press that 
the financiallyoriented executive a once popular breed of 
manager is about to become a management fossil 
the truth he said is that the breed is alive well and 
multiplying the misunderstanding he said is based on inaccurate 
assumptions and superficial analyses as well as on oldfashioned 
notions of financial people 
to begin said professor eugene jennings who pioneered studies 
of routes to executive success it is assumed that the heyday of 
the financially oriented executive was in the 1950s when it 
actually was in the 70s 
those with an understanding of numbers came into their own he 
says when corporations discovered somewhat belatedly that they 
were in the business of enhancing shareholder value that was even 
more of a factor than was the rise of computers 
in the 1950s and 1960s he says fewer than 15 percent of chief 
executive officers were financially trained companies then were 
functionally organized around manufacturing or sales for example 
rather than around finances 
in the 1970s there developed a corporate culture more oriented 
to numbers chief financial officers controllers and the like 
proliferated one reason being that corporations divided themselves 
into smaller business units 
hewlett packard for example now has 50 business units 
american telephone amp telegraph has 19 and some corporations such 
as general electric have more than 100 units of varying 
independence all needing financial leadership 
the financial groundswell continues says jennings a professor 
of business at michigan state university 
even plant managers today are aware of such data as the real 
return on invested capital he says once they worked only 
against a budget now they work against a financial plan they 
understand cash and capital needs 
jennings who often serves as adviser to top officers and 
boards tells of a very large corporation that surveyed 39 plant 
managers in 1979 to determine their understanding of elementary 
accounting and finance 
fewer than 30 percent achieved what he calls a decent score 
spurring the company to send all plant managers to an extensive 
financial seminar in addition it added to their objectives a high 
return on invested capital 
result in 1986 the same plants were surveyed and more than 70 
percent of the managers received a decent score 
in our largest corporations today you cannot tell what plant 
and general managers were formally educated in accounting and 
finance from those whose college major was engineering or 
marketing said jennings 
he calls this the institutionalization of numbers and he 
provides some numbers from his own research to document the 
phrasing 
the number of individuals holding the title chief financial 
officer in large corporations has more than doubled since 1979 
the number of titled controllers has nearly tripled 
there are onequarter more chief executive officers with 
financial background and experience than in 1979 
the number of chief financial officers with formal education in 
accounting has doubled in 10 years 
keeping tabs on such things is the professors life work he 
began his studies of what he calls corporate mobility patterns in 
the late 1940s when he published his first book the mobile 
manager now considered a basic reference 
it is for this reason among others that he feels compelled to 
set the record straight on the premature demise of the 
financiallyoriented breed of corporate executive and he seeks to 
deflate these other popular myths 
financiallyoriented executives are in place strictly for the 
short run to correct immediate or temporary problems 
if this is so he says how do you explain the reign of roger 
smith as chief executive officer of general motors who has been 
entrusted with a 65 billion rebuilding program 
financial executives are not creative do not make good general 
managers and are riskaverse 
all wrong he says none more so than the last because they 
know the numbers they are in fact more apt to understand prudent 
risk says the professor 
they have tunnel vision they see all through a narrow prism 
unfounded he says he maintains that about half the very 
largest companies with new advanced product lines in electronics 
consumer goods fast foods chemicals and retailing are headed by 
financiallyoriented executives 
all such notions are oldfashioned and dated he said all that 
is are part of the the massive master myth of the green eyeshade

purchase of strikebound eastern airlines sources said 
another wellknown figure former defense secretary frank 
carlucci is being mentioned as a candidate for the airlines 
bankruptcy examiner 
news of ueberroths interest came as takeover specialist carl c 
icahn was reportedly resuming talks with easterns unions about a 
possible takeover 
a federal judge in miami meanwhile scheduled a hearing for 
thursday on easterns efforts to force its rebellious pilots back 
to work the pilots support for the machinists strike that began 
march 4 virtually grounded miamibased eastern and forced it to 
seek bankruptcy protection five days later 
an offer from ueberroth may be presented to the board of 
easterns parent company texas air corp in the next few days

spokesman art kent in houston said the company would have no 
comment 
there are a lot of those rumors going around kent said 
if and when any agreement is reached to sell eastern im sure all 
the parties involved will issue a statement 
ueberroth was approached last fall by easterns unions to 
consider taking over the airline the unions have said they would 
make wage concessions if ueberroth took over possibly in return 
for part ownership 
easterns demand for 125 million in concessions from its 
machinists triggered the strike 
telephone calls to the office of the machinists local for 
eastern in miami and union officials were not answered monday night 
capt jack bavis a spokesman for easterns pilots union said 
ueberroth would provide greater job security at the airline than 
the current management 
ive got my fingers crossed bavis said 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo met with bavis on march 11 to 
approve discussions between ueberroth and the carriers unions air 
line pilots association spokesman hank weber said in miami today 
discussions have been ongoing since that time weber said 
were viewing this with cautious optimism because frank lorenzo 
has been in this position before it is an option we didnt have 
before 
ueberroth met with eastern officials in december during 
baseballs winter meetings in atlanta then traveled to miami for 
further talks a baseball source said ueberroth also has discussed 
a possible buyout with lorenzo other sources said 
the wall street journal today said ueberroths offer ranged from 
300 million to 500 million

eastern since the strike began sources said at the time of the 
bankruptcy court filing eastern said it had about 300 million in 
cash and was losing about 4 million a day 
ueberroth 51 is known as a strong administrator who bullied 
baseball owners and whose hard negotiations with foreign officials 
as president of the 1984 los angeles olympic organizing committee 
helped the games turn an unprecedented 230 million profit 
he has been a director of major corporations as a board member 
of ef hutton inc he engineered the companys sale to shearson 
lehman brothers inc earning 850000 in fees 
ueberroth could face competition from twa owner icahn who has 
publicly expressed interest and has been supported by easterns 
unions 
icahn is meeting again with union officials to discuss a 
possible takeover and hopes to use union concessions to persuade 
easterns creditors to let him take control said brian freeman an 
investment banker with close ties to the machinists union 
the list of possible bankruptcy examiners includes carlucci and 
top securities fraud lawyer leon silverman sources said 
us bankruptcy trustee harold jones who is administering

baseball bosses casino kings astronauts and 
corporate raiders the saga that is eastern airlines now features 
a virtual honor roll of big names and big egos from the big leagues 
from baseball commissioner peter v ueberroth and developer 
donald trump to former defense secretary frank carlucci and 
takeover artist carl icahn glamour names from business and 
politics are being mentioned for key roles in either saving or 
buying the beleaguered carrier 
the cast of characters isnt surprising for an airline that has 
been run by a world war i flying ace an apollo astronaut and its 
current highprofile chairman who has been reviled by unions as 
the boris badenov of the airline industry 
the namedropping potential has grown almost daily during the 
25day eastern strike as the soap opera of the 60yearold airline 
has moved from boardroom to picket line to bankruptcy court 
theres a little emotional sentimental factor in it said 
robert serling an aviation historian in tuscon ariz trying to 
explain part of easterns allure it is an old very respected 
carrier thats played a part in the countrys air transportation 
history since the 20s 
ueberroth who steps down as baseball commissioner saturday is 
being mentioned as a possible eastern buyer a former vice 
president of trans international airlines ueberroth also founded a 
small travel agency that later grew into giant first travel corp 
the continents second largest such business 
ueberroth has turned around unprofitable operations before 
leading the 1984 olympics to an unprecedented 230 million profit 
and boosting baseballs drooping attendance and earnings 
trump the multimillionaire casino and real estate developer 
made an artful 365 million deal last year for easterns northeast 
shuttle since the strike trump has said he wants to cut his price 
by a third 
icahn already owns trans world airlines and is a union favorite 
to acquire eastern talks between eastern and icahn were held last 
year and icahn has restarted negotiations with unions 
carlucci whom president reagan appointed national security 
adviser after the irancontra debacle and later became defense 
secretary is among the candidates for a different kind of cleanup 
job the bankruptcy examiner who would scrutinize deals between 
eastern and its parent texas air corp 
another candidate for examiner is leon silverman an attorney 
for jailed stock speculator ivan boesky 
the board of texas air itself includes carl pohlad owner of 
baseballs minnesota twins and a longtime business associate of 
texas air chairman frank lorenzo pohlad reportedly brought in 
ueberroth to negotiate an eastern sale 
eastern once one of the worlds four largest carriers always 
has been a place for glamour names it was run by eddie 
rickenbacker the world war i flying ace from 1935 until he was 
ousted by the companys board in 1964 
later piloting eastern was frank borman an air force colonel 
who commanded the apollo 8 moon orbital mission borman who

boost grain futures prices tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
but soybean futures fell for the third straight day as rain soaked 
the midwest 
the modest rally in the grain markets followed a sharp 
acrosstheboard drop in prices in the previous session 
traders said mondays price break apparently brought the soviet 
union into the cash market 
most guesses are that they bought 2 million tons for april 
through june shipment said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter reynolds inc in chicago there are all the earmarks of 
business actually being done the only real question is how much 
was done 
rainfall in the midwest where dryness from last years drought 
still lingers kept pressure on soybean prices 
soybean oil futures fell sharply on selling inspired by 
weakening chart signals the contract for may delivery of soybean

kirk kerkorian makes most of his 
news these days trading in movie and casino companies but the 
investor whos among those rumored to be interested in eastern 
airlines made his first fortune in airplanes 
kerkorian who controls mgmua communications co and the luxury 
airline mgm grand inc got his start in business by building a 
charter airline after world war ii over the years he has showed 
varying degrees of interest in western air lines and pan am as well 
now sources close to strikebound eastern say kerkorian may be 
interested in bidding on the airline 
kerkorians staff wouldnt comment tuesday on media reports 
concerning eastern 
the 71yearold investor whose personal wealth is estimated by 
forbes magazine at 950 million shuns publicity but the complex 
financial maneuvers of his tracinda corp investment company are 
frequent news particularly in hollywood where almost weekly 
rumors swirl over the fate of debtburdened mgmua 
kerkorian controls about 80 percent of the movie company which 
he assembled out of parts of the old metrogoldwynmayer and united 
artists studios in the last year he has proposed bringing in 
outside investors to run the mgm half then suggested he would sell 
the ua half then recapitalized the whole company with 180 million 
of his own money 
all or part of the company that made oscar nominees rain 
man and a fish called wanda is officially up for sale now 
but most observers expect kerkorian would try to structure a deal 
that lets him keep a piece of mgmua 
another kerkoriancontrolled company mgm grand inc combines 
two of kerkorians longtime interests airplanes and las vegas 
casinohotels the company which reported a 62 million profit in 
1988 owns the desert inn and sands and runs a threeplane 
allluxury airline between los angeles and new york featuring 
boeing 727s adorned with a version of the mgm movie lion 
kerkorian who was born to armenian immigrants in fresno 
ferried planes to britain for the army during world war ii 
in 1947 he started the nations first nonscheduled air 
service linking los angeles and las vegas in a pattern typical of 
his later business dealings he sold trans international airlines 
bought it back and then sold it again in 1968 eventually making 
more than 100 million 
the eastern rumors would put kerkorian in a situation similar to 
his last flirtation with a big airline that was in 1987 when pan 
american world airways unions offered 230 million in wage 
concessions if kerkorian could buy the airline from parent pan am 
corp 
pan am rejected kerkorians offer to pay 75 million cash and 
assemble 400 million in junk bond financing and assume the 
airlines 1 billion in debt 
kerkorian began assembling his present empire in 1968 with the 
profit from the trans international deal he bought the flamingo 
hotel in las vegas built the international hotel amp casino and 
bought 31 percent of western airlines and 48 percent of mgm 
it is mgm that has served as base for most of his later dealings 
he split the company into separate casino and movie operations 
combining the movie business with ua in a series of transactions 
those included one with ted turner that in effect gave the 
atlanta media entrepreneur mgms 3000title movie library for 15 
billion

jc penney co inc attempting to freshen its 
image will air new commercials during the academy awards program 
wednesday night aimed at focusing attention on the 87yearold 
retailers latest fashions 
in a series of four 30second spots the retailer will highlight 
mens and womens apparel and other merchandise such as jewelry 
and home furnishings penneys advertising agency nw ayer said 
the ad for mens fashions features a man clad in a 
europeanstyled suit and silk tie walking down an alley the 
voiceover says people buy more mens suits shirts slacks and 
ties at jc penney than at any other department store and that 
suits us just fine 
the womens clothing commercial shows a woman in an updated 
version of a classically tailored oatmealcolored suit riding on 
what appears to be an oldfashioned ironwork elevator 
as she descends light coming through the door illuminates what 
shes wearing and the following is heard people buy more womens 
fashions at jc penney than at any other department store now 
theres a fashion statement 
jim hradecky the creative director of nw ayers dallas office 
said the commercials are a bit different for penney which normally 
gears advertising to sales or special events such as the promotion 
of a new line of merchandise 
these are neither they are fashion oriented said hradecky 
who wrote the commercials 
he said the commercials which are designed as a supplement to 
the retailers regular television ads are significant because they 
promote penney as an authority on fashion 
penney has been a sponsor of the oscar presentation ceremony in 
past years in 1988 penney debuted one new ad during the show and 
used reedited versions of existing ones 
in october 1987 penney announced plans to alter its retailing 
strategy 
it has placed added emphasis on womens clothing and expanded 
its apparel offerings it also stopped selling various hard goods 
such as home electronics in its retail stores while continuing to 
provide them through its catalogs 
kay baker a penney spokeswoman said the commercials appearing 
wednesday night contain what she called a new lifestyle 
approach that the retailer had been planning to test in its ads 
but she said penney does not intend to abandon its historical 
strategy of concentrating its ads on events and sales 
the academy awards presentation which attracts more than 25 
million viewers is used by many advertisers as a forum for airing 
their latest promotions

takeover specialist t boone pickens 
countering such sizebased corporate rankings as the fortune 500 
and business week 1000 on tuesday released his own list of 
companies rated by shareholder friendliness 
united shareholders association a group formed by pickens to 
lobby in favor of shareholders rights and against takeover 
defenses rated 1000 companies based on their lack of obstacles to 
takeover price and dividend performance and degree of management 
ownership 
the group claims managers with a personal stake in a company 
perform better and it claims companies without such antitakeover 
devices as poison pills and golden parachutes represent better 
values than those with them 
usas corporate 1000 ratings point out which managements are 
attuned to shareholder interests sort of the good the bad and the 
ugly of corporate america pickens said 
the texas oilman who has chased some big companies like 
phillips petroleum co and newmont mining corp and is considering 
running for governor said the list wasnt intended to be a stock 
tip sheet but he is billing it as a consumer guide and 
owners manual for corporate america 
kathryn rudie harrigan a professor at columbia business school 
criticized pickens emphasis on stock price and dividend 
performance 
companies that do things to pretty up their stock prices are 
not necessarily managing for the long run they are probably 
cutting into not just the fat but also the muscle they need for 
longrun competitiveness she said 
according to pickens the 20 best companies are price circle 
k aon southwest airlines tca cable tv gap autodesk

future 
foreign exchange dealers in europe said the us currency 
recovered quickly from concerted dollarselling by the central 
banks of west germany and other countries traders estimated the 
central banks sold nearly 200 million 
the absence of the influential bank of japan from the markets

banks were doing

gold futures prices plunged to a 5week low tuesday as 
investors reacting to a surging dollar moved their money out of 
precious metals and into interestbearing instruments 
on other markets energy futures fell sharply reversing most of 
the previous days gains soybeans slipped while grain futures 
advanced cattle futures were lower and pork futures were mixed 
gold settled 810 to 930 lower on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in april at 38350 a troy 
ounce it was the lowest settlement price for a gold contract on 
the exchange since feb 17 when gold finished at 38080 an ounce 
after trading that day as low as 380 a 27month low 
silver futures settled 152 cents to 174 cents lower with may 
at 5848 a troy ounce 
gold prices typically rise and fall with inflation fears 
reflecting the metals tendency to hold its worth even as the 
dollar falls in value 
a stronger dollar is viewed as antiinflationary it makes us 
goods more expensive overseas and makes foreignmade goods cheaper 
in this country reducing demand for usmade goods and slowing 
the economys growth 
the rapid rise of shortterm interest rates during the first 
quarter of this year has contributed to the dollars strength and 
drawn investment dollars into governmentbacked securities and 
certificates of deposit 
several recent government reports on wholesale and retail prices 
seemed to suggest that inflation was on the rise but tuesdays 
activity in the currency and preciousmetals markets indicates 
confidence among investors that the federal reserve board is 
succeeding in stifling inflation by forcing interest rates up 
i think the markets perception is that these high real rates 
of return on the dollar are going to continue and may even 
increase and i dont think thats real positive for the gold 
market said john norris the head of preciousmetals trading for 
citibank in new york 
a further drop in golds price below the feb 17 low of 380 an 
ounce would likely trigger an even steeper selloff analysts said 
but i dont think thats going to happen said peter 
cardillo commodity trading adviser with josephthal amp co a new 
yorkbased futures brokerage i think theres enough support to 
hold at this level and we should begin to see some european bargain 
hunting 
oil prices fell sharply on the new york mercantile exchange on 
profittaking off of mondays strong gains which had pushed crude 
oil to its highest price in 19 months 
mondays runup was linked to the massive alaskan oil spill and 
the shutdown of the port of valdez the southern terminus of the 
alaska pipeline the port was reopened on tuesday 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 69 cents 
lower with may at 1991 a barrel heating oil was 131 cents to 
254 cents lower with april at 5504 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 30 cent to 107 cents lower with april at 5868 cents

a rumored soviet purchase of us corn helped boost grain 
futures prices on the chicago board of trade but soybean futures 
fell for the third straight day as rain soaked the midwest 
wheat settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with may at 428 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents higher with may at 273 a

former manhattan us attorney rudolph giuliani 
who led a crackdown on whitecollar crime during his fiveyear 
tenure said tuesday he will travel to japan next month to offer 
advice on prosecuting insider trading and other securities fraud 
the japanese government is currently embroiled in a stock 
scandal of its own that has implicated government officials and is 
putting pressure on prime minister noboru takeshita 
giuliani whose office brought about 50 securities fraud 
indictments in his term that ended in january said he was 
contacted by private attorneys in japan and will lecture to 
officials in tokyo april 1314 
i think its very very important for the united states that 
in other countries that are part of the world market that we have a 
similar set of rules he said otherwise were at a competitive 
disadvantage 
giuliani a possible new york mayoral candidate now in private 
practice said he will meet with more than 10 japanese investment 
firms and us firms with offices there as well as government 
agencies securities officials and law enforcement organizations 
he said he will discuss us insider trading and other securities 
fraud laws and cases 
japan home to the worlds biggest stock market modeled its 
postwar laws on securities fraud after those in the united states 
but rarely enforced them markets in some european countries and 
hong kong are loosely regulated and insider trading and other 
financial scandals recently hit france and mexico 
many of them have statutes and laws some similar to ours 
some a little different giuliani said 
the major problem theyre undergoing is the same problem we 
were undergoing in the 40s 50s and 60s not enforcing them 
not knowing how to enforce them and not having educated the 
institutions on the importance of the rules he said 
the current scandal in japan involves the sale of thousands of 
shares of unlisted stock by the recruit co to politicians and 
other prominent people at bargain prices the buyers reaped 
windfalls when the shares were publicly traded later 
at least 17 senior politicians including takeshita and former 
prime minister yasuhiro nakasone have been linked to the scandal

the nations largest oil spill has cost 
alaska more than 10 million in lost revenue because of reduced 
flow through the transalaska pipeline and more losses are 
expected officials said tuesday 
alaska the nations secondlargest oil producer relies on the 
industry for more than 80 percent of its revenues state officials 
said they dont expect any cashflow problems from the spill but 
are monitoring the situation 
the 60 percent cutback in pipeline flow since fridays tanker 
spill at valdez harbor has cost the state treasury about 24 
million a day in lost taxes and royalty payments said cliff groh 
special assistant to the state revenue commissioner 
alaska expects to lose less than 20 million before the pipeline 
can resume full production which may occur before the end of the 
week said david ramseur a spokesman for gov steve cowper 
cowper and the state legislature are in the final stages of 
preparing next years budget the governor has proposed a 
statusquo 23 billion spending plan and he is not expected to 
revise it because of the pipeline slowdown 
low oil prices over the past year have been a bigger problem for 
the state treasury depending on oil prices alaska faces a 300 
million to 600 million deficit next year and lawmakers are 
considering cuts in services and new taxes 
the oil industry also is feeling the income loss because of the 
pipeline restriction 
theres actually very little we can do to make it up said 
paul laird of bp exploration alaska inc the largest producer in 
alaskas north slope region which feeds the pipeline 
he said the pipeline was operating at capacity before the spill 
and cannot accommodate heavier flows to recover the lost revenue 
clearly were suffering financially just like the state is 
laird said 
bp america inc exxon corp and atlantic richfield co are 
responsible for more than 90 percent of north slope production 
laird said mobil corp unocal corp phillips petroleum co and 
amerada hess corp are the other north slope producers that share 
in the pipeline ownership 
the 800mile pipeline can move about 2 million barrels of crude 
oil daily but its flow has been reduced to 800000 barrels a day 
since fridays tanker spill 
the us coast guard reopened valdez harbor to tanker traffic 
tuesday morning and the pipeline could be back at full production 
by the end of the week said tom brennan of alyeska pipeline 
service co 
when the coast guard closed the harbor to tanker traffic friday 
alyeska reduced the flow of north slope oil to cope with limited 
storage space at valdez alyeska spokesman john ratterman said 
the harbor was shut to traffic until enough of the spill was 
cleared to allow ships to avoid the slick an arco tanker arrived 
at the dock tuesday and about 10 more were waiting to fill up 
the opening of the pipeline in 1977 helped push alaska to number 
two in us oil production running just 3 percent behind texas in 
the first two months of the year according to the american 
petroleum institute in washington 
there were a couple of months last year when alaska actually 
did pass texas said ed porter a senior economist at the 
institute texas is declining fairly rapidly and alaska until 
this year was still growing 
texas production started a sharp decline in 1986 he said and 
most people feel right now that alaska is at or near its peak 
texas produced an average of 2026 million barrels a day in 
january and february with alaska at 1959 million barrels the 
institute reported

business executives are forecasting a strong 
second quarter with profit expectations for the three months 
starting saturday at their highest level since 1984 according to 
survey results released tuesday 
business executives plans to increase prices are clearly 
having at least a shortterm impact on profit expectations said 
joseph w duncan corporate economist and chief statistician for 
the dun amp bradstreet corp which conducted the poll of 1500 
executives 
order books are strong but the ability to maintain high 
profit expectations throughout 1989 is questionable he said in a 
statement 
nearly half those polled said they planned to increase prices in 
the second quarter 
in the survey conducted feb 827 the executives in 
manufacturing retailing and wholesaling were asked if they 
expected an increase decrease or no change in secondquarter 
sales profits prices inventories employment and new orders 
expectations for higher secondquarter profits climbed to the 
highest level since 1984 rising nine points to 69 on dun amp 
bradstreets index of profit expectations 
the surveys indexes are calculated by subtracting the 
percentage of respondents predicting decreases from the percentage 
of those expecting increases 
the salesoptimism index rose six points to 74 from 68 in the 
first quarter and five points from the second quarter of 1988 
the index of companies expecting to increase prices rose to 46 
from 41 in the first quarter 
inflationary pressures are now pushing prices up after 
remaining fairly consistent for the past five quarters duncan 
said 
the employmentoptimism index decreased one point to 23 from the 
first quarter mostly due to a twopoint drop in expectations among 
wholesalers dun amp bradstreet said 
the index of companies exepectations for increased inventories 
rose three points to 29 a finding that duncan said could prove a 
problem later in the year if increased prices make it difficult to 
move goods 
the optimism index for new orders among manufacturers of 
nondurable goods rose six points to 71 while the index for 
durable goods manufacturers increased five points to 70

afternoon meeting with secretary of state james a baker iii said 
afterwards that no final agreement had been reached but the two 
sides agreed to continue to talk that was the firm objective 
but matsunaga added that no decision had been made on the timing 
of new meetings the ambassador said seiki nishihiro the deputy 
director general of the japanese defense agency who had also taken 
part in the discussions was returning to japan 
under the agreement originally negotiated last year by the 
reagan administration the new plane would be built jointly by 
general dynamics and japans mitsubishi heavy industries the plane 
would be modeled on the americanmade f16 fighter 
bush who disclosed last week that he had decided to go ahead 
with the project told reporters tuesday that the united states is 
pressing for more clarity in the revised agreement to be submitted 
to congress 
its going back and forth a little bit all i want to know is 
that the agreement is clear no point in having an unclear 
agreement bush said 
we have a lot at stake here the president added a lot at 
stake in terms of the common defense we have a lot at stake in 
terms of commerce we have a lot at stake in terms of technology 
and all im asking is to be clear 
the project has encountered stiff opposition in congress where 
critics have called it a 8 billion hightechnology giveaway to 
japan they say tokyo should purchase americanmade planes to help 
offset the 50 billion us trade deficit with japan 
even with within the administration there have been skeptics at 
high levels including commerce secretary robert mosbacher and us 
trade representative carla hills they have argued that without 
careful safeguards the deal could give japan free help in 
developing an aerospace industry of its own to compete with us 
companies 
bush suggested he still wants to go ahead with the project so 
long as there are necessary safeguards 
the united states will keep its word properly insisting on 
clarity in the agreement and thats about where we stand right 
now bush said he spoke after a meeting in the oval office to 
discuss the oil spill in alaska 
a us negotiating group made up of officials from the 
commerce defense and state departments have been meeting all week 
with japanese officials in an effort to come up with a final 
agreement 
matsunaga met tuesday morning with deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger the first official meeting between the sides 
since a negotiating session last thursday 
but state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said the fsx 
fighter was discussed only briefly because the meeting was a 
courtesy call planned before the controversy erupted 
one us official close to the negotiations denied tuesday that 
the agreement was unraveling suggesting that japanese officials 
were treating the talks more as a trade negotiation than a 
defenserelated one and doing a considerable amount of 
maneuvering for home consumption 
i feel well still get a deal said the official who 
insisted upon anonymity 
the japanese negotiate differently on trade on trade 
negotiation on trade negotiations they always go right up to the 
wall they set a deadline and then they negotiate past it to show 
theyve gone the extra mile the official said 
white house sources said that the president could move on the 
agreement with an announcement in a matter of hours once the final 
document has been readied 
the japanese say they need to have the agreement by friday to 
include the project in the budget for the new fiscal year that 
begins april 1 
asked if that deadline would be met bush said i dont know 
whether it will be done by then or not 
the reagan administration began negotiations on the fighter 
after japan refused to buy f16s off the shelf and indicated it 
wanted to build its own jet fighter 
the agreement reportedly will seek to protect sophisticated us 
computer codes that enable the planes computer software to fly the 
plane and control its sophisticated weaponry

a new daily tabloid will hit the homes and 
newsstands of st louis in september and its publisher will be a 
man who has been a top executive at the citys established 
newspaper publishing magnate ralph ingersoll ii announced tuesday 
the newspaper the st louis sun will be published seven 
mornings a week and compete headon with the st louis 
postdispatch a morning newspaper owned by the pulitzer publishing 
co 
the postdispatch has been the citys only newspaper since the 
st louis globedemocrat folded under financial strain in october 
1986 
this is a completely new newspaper ingersoll said at a news 
conference i assure you the sun will not just be a good 
newspaper it will be a great newspaper 
asked about the slant of the editorial page ingersoll said the 
paper would be a conservator of traditional values 
ingersoll said he will be chairman and editor in chief of the 
newspaper and will set up a residence in st louis to oversee the 
operation initially 
robert m jelenic executive vice president of ingersoll 
publications will be the president of the new company and thomas 
m tallarico 44 a senior vice president and general manager of 
the postdispatch since 1986 will be the publisher 
tallarico submitted his resignation to postdispatch publisher 
nicholas g penniman iv tuesday morning sending shock waves 
through that newspaper 
penniman said he was stunned when tallarico gave him the news 
penniman said it was his view that tallarico had taken on the job 
of burying the postdispatch 
we of course wont let that happen penniman said 
ingersoll owns the suburban journals 43 nondaily newspapers 
published throughout the metropolitan area he said the journals 
and the sun would be operated separately 
ingersoll said his company has invested more than 100 million 
in the st louis area with its nondaily publications and is 
committing millions more to establish the sun he would not divulge 
specific figures on the suns startup cost 
the organization has acquired colorcapable presses that can 
print 128 pages an issue the press run will be 200000 copies 
ingersoll said 
the paper to be housed in a new downtown office building would 
be able to operate successfully with less than 100000 circulation 
he said ingersoll said the sun will hire a staff of 75 to 100 
reporters 
ingersoll said he was not concerned that many cities have become 
onenewspaper communities due to lack of advertiser support for a 
second paper 
well be competitive with the postdispatch volume one 
number one ingersoll said the sun will be profitable in the 
second year of its operation and it will continue to grow 
tallarico said the sun unlike many other tabloids in the united 
states and europe would not emphasize sensational news 
st louis mayor vincent c schoemehl jr who was involved in an 
attempt to save the globedemocrat in 1984 called the announcement 
a very historic day 
ingersoll publications a privately held company that had 
revenues of more than 700 million in 1988 operates 40 daily 
newspapers and more than 150 nondaily newspapers 
circulation of the daily newspapers exceeds more than 125 
million its nondaily editions reach an additional 5 million homes

fishermen mobilized tuesday to protect 
untainted beaches and estuaries from the nations worst oil spill 
and the port of valdez reopened to tankers lined up to load north 
slope crude oil 
cleanup officials said they had abandoned hope of controlling 
the spill with mechanical skimmers or chemical dispersants and 
planned instead to rely on burning the oil which formed a long 
black bruise on the brilliant blue waters of prince william sound 
three top bush administration officials arrived late in the 
afternoon and quickly departed for a look at the polluted area 
president bush had asked transportation secretary samuel 
skinner environmental protection agency administrator bill reilly 
and coast guard commandant paul yost to take a hard look at where 
this disaster stands 
bush said the federal government may take over the cleanup from 
exxon if the officials conclude that not enough is being done 
asked whether he was satisfied with exxons efforts bush said 
theyre certainly making a good beginning here but there are 
some conflicting reports on that i dont want to prejudge that 
alaska gov steve cowper a democrat who has been highly 
critical of the cleanup flew to valdez and joined the officials 
upon their arrival he said he wants the federal government to 
designate clearly which agency is in charge when spills occur 
cowper said the oil industry hasnt shown the ability to handle 
tanker spills he said there is no guarantee that things would be 
better if another accident took place 
since the tanker exxon valdez ran aground friday spilling 
240000 barrels the oil has moved more than 40 miles 
contaminating beaches and marine life as it goes 
this oil spill has been 12 years in the coming said don 
cornett an exxon spokesman but he claimed that given the amount 
of oil transported during that period the industrys safety record 
actually is quite good 
with assistance from the state a fishermens group from nearby 
cordova dispatched a few dozen boats with cleanup gear to protect 
three important pink salmon hatcheries in the path of the rapidly 
spreading slick 
beaches have been fouled by oil on at least five uninhabited 
islands including back island reef island blight island and 
naked island and the slick was fast approached sensitive 
salmonspawning areas on the larger knight island to the southwest 
frankly we are past attempting to recover much oil said 
larry dietrick a spokesman for the alaska department of 
environmental conservation our primary efforts are now in the 
defense of very sensitive areas 
exxon said it planned to turn loose an army of workers equipped 
with rakes and shovels to clean up rugged remote beaches already 
contaminated but dietrick said there was no sign of that 
happening and the fishermen said they couldnt wait any longer 
as contractors scrambled to hire workers off the street for the 
backbreaking task of cleaning isolated beaches and coves the 
federal bureau of land management started mobilizing five fire 
crews totaling about 100 people to assist blm spokesman dave 
vickery said the crews should arrive in valdez on wednesday 
cornett said workers will rake and shovel oilsoaked debris into 
barrels for removal from the beaches and that rocky beaches will 
be washed down 
the shift to manual labor came as the size of the slick 
outstripped the means to contain it cornett said there were 12 
skimmers deployed early tuesday but they had managed to scoop only 
about 3500 barrels from the seas surface 
cornett said cleanup crews lost an excellent opportunity to use 
chemical dispersants on the spill sunday because the state 
department of environmental conservation and the federal 
environmental protection agency were hesitant to authorize use of 
the chemcials 
dec commission dennis kelso denied tuesday that the state 
delayed approval he said exxon told him calm water over the 
weekend would have rendered the dispersants ineffective 
coast guard spokesman todd nelson said tests showed that the 
chemical dispersants failed to contain the spill 
theres no way possible with technology that exists today that 
they could have contained that slick nelson said 
he added that reduced winds could allow the resumption of 
operations to burn oil near fouled islands were very optimistic 
about the burning its a lot faster than the mechanical 
containment nelson said 
exxon spokesman brian dunphy said more dispersal chemicals were 
sprayed tuesday although he did not know the quantity an 
environmental law firm trustees for alaska filed a freedom of 
information act request that the company disclose the products 
chemical components 
exxon shipping co president frank iarossi conceded that the 
cleanup is not proceeding well believe me that is an 
understatement weve got a mess on our hands 
the spill into the oncepristine sound forced the closure of the 
port of valdez which forms the southern terminus of the 
transalaska oil pipeline flow through the pipeline which 
supplies nearly onefourth of the nations supply of domestic crude 
oil was reduced to 800000 barrels a day from 21 million 
when the port reopened 10 tankers led by the arco sag river 
were waiting to enter port and load at the alyeska pipeline service 
co marine terminal coast guard lt ed wieliczkiewicz said 
wieliczkiewicz said the sag river arrived late in the morning to 
pick up 480000 barrels the omi columbia was expected to arrive 
later followed by the arco alaska 
the terminal can load up to four tankers at a time at a rate of 
100000 barrels an hour 
the huge vessels were steered into valdez by two tugs and each 
vessel was required to have a harbor pilot on board traffic was 
limited to daylight 
an oil company official who asked not to be identified 
predicted oil prices on the world market would have risen 
dramatically if the port had remained closed much longer prices on 
the spot market actually dipped slightly tuesday after rising 
sharply the day before 
meanwhile several more pumps were put to work transferring oil 
from the damaged tanker to a sister ship the exxon baton rouge 
cornett said that as of early tuesday about 200000 barrels had 
been removed the 987foot exxon valdez had approximately 1 million 
barrels remaining on board after it rammed bligh reef about 25 
miles out of valdez 
cornett said salvage crews are confident the 3yearold ships 
structural integrity is sound and that the vessel can be refloated 
and returned to drydock without any additional spills he estimated 
it would take about three more days to empty the exxon valdez 
cornett refused to comment on reports that the ships captain 
joseph hazelwood had a drinking problem he insisted it would be 
inappropriate since the matter is the subject of a halfdozen 
investigations by state and federal authorities 
hazelwood 42 was not on the bridge when the vessel left 
shipping lanes to avoid ice rammed a charted reef and became stuck 
on bligh reef according to iarossi the third mate who did not 
have proper certification was in charge at the time 
results of drug and alcohol tests on crew members could be made 
public later this week 
hazelwood has been arrested twice for drunken driving once in 
1984 near his home of huntington ny and once in 1988 in conway 
nh on sept 13 1988 in conway nh his drivers license has 
been revoked three times including once when he refused to submit 
to a breathalyzer test 
iarossi told the associated press he was unaware of hazelwoods 
recent convictions and the loss of his drivers license but he 
went on to note that two of the incidents occurred before he 
turned himself in for alcohol treatment 
iarossi said exxon was not involved in the treatment that was 
between him and his doctor 
hazelwoods mother margaret acknowledged in a telephone 
interview with the associated press that her son had a drinking 
problem 
i know he was rehabilitated mrs hazelwood said from her 
home in huntington exxon knows it
