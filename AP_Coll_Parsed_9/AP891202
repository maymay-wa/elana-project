tropical storm karen moved southwest away from cuba 
on friday after dumping heavy rain on the island 
tropical storm warnings for cuba were lifted by the national 
hurricane center in coral gables fla 
the storm moving in a clockwise loop could make a complete 
circle in the caribbean if it stays together long enough to meet 
with a big funnel trough located in the gulf of mexico forecaster 
bob case said 
that could cause the storm to move to the northeast in a big 
circle case said 
but there is a 5050 chance the storm will dissipate before 
then he said 
we dont see any major dramatic effect on land areas he 
said 
the system surprised forecasters by achieving tropical storm 
strength thursday when its winds hit 39 mph 
rainfall reports thursday from cuba included more than 14 inches 
at punta del este on the isle of youth more than seven inches in 
matanzas and nearly five inches in havana 
at 1030 pm est friday the center of the storm was located 
near latitude 178 north longitude 852 west or about 175 miles 
east of belize karens highest sustained winds were near 40 mph 
the hurricane season begins june 1 and ends nov 30 however 
hurricanes have been recorded in every month but april

denverbased regional phone company include voter registration 
forms at the bottom of one of the instruction pages the form can 
be clipped and mailed in an envelope to the county auditor 
state income tax booklets that will be sent out at the end of 
the year also will include voter registration forms under 
legislation enacted this year 
earl mix a us west vice president said iowa is the first state 
in which the forms will be included in telephone books he 
predicted other states would follow suit

japanese researchers have duplicated 
recent us cold fusion experiments and are reaching for the 
lead in the emerging technology one of the scientists who touched 
off the furor complained friday 
a us department of energy panel recently refused to back a 
national nuclear fusion program based on discoveries by university 
of utah electrochemist b stanley pons and a british colleague 
martin fleischmann 
physicists contend the utah research has been largely 
discredited because other experimenters have failed to fully 
duplicate pons and fleischmanns results 
but pons said friday that japan and india are making major 
investments in nuclear fusion research and development that could 
wrest leadership in the field away from the us 
in march pons and fleischmann said they had achieved room 
temperature or cold fusion by immersing in deuteriumrich 
heavy water rods of palladium inside electrically charged platinum 
coils the two said the reaction yield heat equivalent to 100 times 
the energy needed to produce the reaction 
theyve been duplicating our experiments since late march 
pons said the japanese and indians are doing just whats 
obvious theyre doing the research needed to find out if its 
feasible or not and theyre finding it is 
a bitter pons said if the us does lose its lead in nuclear 
fusion research the blame should rest squarely on the shoulders of 
the does energy research advisory board the board recently 
concluded there is no conclusive evidence that pons and fleischmann 
actually produced fusion 
weve tried to tell the country that research money is the 
only way to cover these developments properly and its pretty 
obvious thats not going to get done pons said we certainly 
cant match the scope of the work that the japanese are doing 
japanese physicists at japans nagoya university said in the 
november issue of the englishlanguage japanese journal of applied 
physics that fusion had occurred spontaneously between two 
palladium electrodes in a flask filled with deuterium gas 
the japanese said the major difference between their work and 
that of pons and fleischmann was the use of deuterium gas instead 
of heavy water 
however pons he and fleischmann already have carried out the 
same experiment as the japanese and have applied for a patent on 
the procedure 
japanese researchers point out their own experiments yielded a 
high level of neutron emissions up to 20000 times the normal 
background level that is one possible indicator of a fusion 
reaction 
topping that another group of researchers at osaka university 
this week reported detecting neutron levels 25 million times 
normal levels in a coldfusion experiment using platinum electrodes 
in heavy water 
in addition to the japanese and india fusion research also 
reportedly is under way in china and the soviet union

chinese students are dismayed at president bushs 
veto of a bill to let them remain here after their visas expire 
saying he seems to be exempting china from the human rights 
standards held for other socialist countries 
but several students expressed faith in bushs promise that he 
would help those who fear returning to their homeland through other 
means 
pei min xin a graduate student in government at harvard 
university and a prodemocracy leader said friday that bush caved 
into pressure from china calling the fierce chinese government 
opposition to the bill a bluff 
people like us have come to this country not only to study but 
to learn how democracy operates we have found that this single 
case is rather discouraging pei said when it comes down to a 
choice between human rights and geopolitical interests the leading 
democracy did not hesitate to choose the latter 
said brandeis university student shen tong the basic signal 
to me from the american government is that the government still 
holds different standards about human rights in china and other 
countries 
bush on thursday vetoed the bill which had been passed without 
opposition in congress the president said it was unnecesssary in 
light of other administrative proposals 
the bill affects about 40000 chinese students and scholars in 
the united states the chinese government has attacked the bill and 
has threatened to cut off all foreign exchange programs with the 
united states if it passes 
bush said he was directing attorney general dick thornburgh to 
take steps to administratively extend visa benefits to chinese 
students 
in a statement bush said the administrative steps will provide 
the same benefits and accomplish the laudable objectives of 
the congress while preserving my ability to manage foreign 
relations 
chinese students are particularly concerned about a chinese 
requirement that they return to china for two years before 
reapplying after their visas expire bushs directions to 
thornburgh include waivers of the twoyear requirement 
wuer kaixi a prominent chinese student activist who escaped to 
this country after the chinese crushed demonstrations in and around 
beijings tiananmen square believed bush would help students 
of course we hoped very much to have the bill pass but we 
were also glad and thankful to president bush that he did in fact 
try to help chinese students wuer said through a translator 
i hope bush will do what he promised 
bush may have been playing a diplomatic game supporting the 
democracy movement in fact while ostensibly following the wishes of 
the chinese government said patrick maddox associate director of 
harvards fairbank center for east asian research and a frequent 
vistor to china 
maddox said bush also may be assuming that the bill will be 
overridden by congress which would give a good plug to his 
chinese friends while letting the bill take effect 
pei said chinese students are reluctant to seek political asylum 
in this country because they eventually wish to return to their 
homeland i am a patriot living abroad waiting to go back to 
china he said 
pei who has studied in the united states for five years said 
he has learned his name is on a blacklist of prodemocracy 
students if he returned home now pei said i would face at 
least life in prison or execution right away

if presidents bush and gorbachev run out of 
issues at their seaborne summit they could try to settle stubborn 
disputes about bonds issued under the czar and damage claims 
against american troops in the soviet union 70 years ago 
the seemingly arcane bond issue is in fact a serious obstacle to 
the soviet unions hopes of borrowing money in the united states 
weve got a pile of obstacles that high said valery 
sorokin economic counselor at the soviet embassy holding his hand 
about two feet above a coffee table sorokin has compiled a 33page 
summary of problems that slow trade between the two countries 
negotiators have worked for over a year on the issue of bonds 
that the soviets repudiated when they took power after the 
overthrow of the czar sorokin said there has been little progress 
the soviets have made agreements with britain and switzerland to 
redeem such bonds held by citizens there for a few cents on the 
dollar 
one soviet official speaking anonymously estimated the bonds 
face value as high as 300 million they were issued by railroads 
and other privately owned business under the czar 
we get letters from americans every once in a while asking us 
what to do with them sorokin said in an interview 
a few dealers have been willing to buy them for small sums 
collectors have admired the certificates for their elaborate 
engraving they were not considered to have any other value so 
some were destroyed because they were creased or discolored 
the government that ruled russia just before the soviet takeover 
in 1917 was allied with the united states against germany in world 
war i it got 1926 million worth of loans from the united states 
the soviets repudiated those loans too and made their own peace 
with germany 
president woodrow wilson sent us troops to russia in a 
combined action with britain france and japan the soviet 
government under josef stalin and his successors diligently kept 
the memory of that brief conflict alive though it has been 
forgotten by most americans 
we have our claims too sorokin said 
with accumulated interest the wartime loan claim now amounts to 
almost 1 billion as long as it is not settled a law passed in 
1934 bars the soviets from floating commercial loans in this 
country 
on thursday members of congress asked bush to make a priority 
issue of waiving another obstacle to commerce between the 
superpowers the jacksonvanik amendment that law keeps tariffs 
high against soviet exports because of soviet restrictions on 
emigration now considerably eased 
trade between the two nations faces other restrictions as well 
one us law says no government agency can help the soviets get 
loans of more than 300 million not a large sum in world finance 
it makes an exception only for the commodity credit corporation 
which lends to purchasers of us farm products but because of the 
more farreaching jacksonvanik amendment the soviets have never 
been able to use that exception for their huge purchases of 
american grain 
a 1986 law bans gold imports from south africa as a sanction 
against race segregation laws and also includes the soviet union 
in the ban those are the worlds two biggest producers of gold 
a spokesman for mtb banking corp which opens an exhibit of 
coins in new york next week said it will show soviet silver and 
palladium coins but no gold ones 
they wouldnt let us bring in any samples said chris 
ullman not even a collection of historic coins from the 
hermitage museum in leningrad

two salvadoran officials are questioning 
whether an american woman who was arrested in san salvador after 
weapons and explosives were found in the back yard of the home she 
rented was willfully helping rebels 
ricardo valdivieso the salvadoran undersecretary of foreign 
affairs suggested friday at a news conference that jennifer j 
casolo may be a naive person who has been used by the leftist 
rebels and that unfortunately she was found in the house at the 
time 
col carlos amando aviles a spokesman for the salvadoran 
military told the same news conference at the national press club 
that he knows casolo and she is a very nice honest person that i 
consider a good american 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the western 
hemisphere subcommittee of the foreign relations committee said he 
was heartened by the statements about casolo a connecticut native 
i am encouraged by these statements and i hope they reflect a 
change in attitude by the salvadoran authorities that will result 
in the swift and favorable resolution of the case against jennifer 
casolo dodd said 
still salvadoran president alfredo cristiani indicated in san 
salvador that a judicial process was called for 
we feel that anybody that breaks the laws in this country no 
matter what nationality they are should be submitted to the 
judicial process cristiani said at a news conference 
if there is enough proof and apparently in this case there 
is in order to start a judicial process one will be started he 
said 
of former attorney general ramsey clark who was in el salvador 
to advise casolo cristiani said if he is involved in any way in 
the politics of el salvador then his permit visa will be revoked 
immediately 
casolo 28 has maintained she is innocent of any military 
connection with the rebels she works in el salvador as a 
representative of the san antonio texasbased christian education 
seminars providing tours for americans who come to see and study 
the country 
she was arrested a week ago after salvadoran officials acting 
on a tip from a captured rebel dug up the back yard of the house 
she had been renting for the past three months and found dynamite 
and thousands of rounds of rifle ammunition 
friends suggested she was framed by the salvadoran government 
but the bush administration took a different view 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said monday this 
is hardly a case of a someone having a few things flipped in their 
shopping bag on the way home and the justice department began 
reviewing the case to determine if she broke the us neutrality 
act 
fitzwater took a softer approach wednesday saying us 
officials were monitoring her case closely to assure she is well 
treated

despite the rapid political change in 
eastern europe and the role soviet leader mikhail gorbachev is 
playing there six former us defense secretaries are still 
skeptical of the permanence of the shift 
i think that we should recognize that although mr gorbachev 
is immensely popular in western europe and even in the united 
states that his popularity his position in the soviet union itself 
has weakened dramatically said james schlesinger who served 
from 1973 to 1975 in the nixon and ford administrations 
schlesinger said friday at the third annual report of the 
secretaries of defense that gorbachev is walking a fine line that 
could tumble him from power if his reforms become too politically 
and financially costly 
the soviet economy is in serious decline there is a 
possibility of a recession within the soviet union and mr 
gorbachevs position is precarious he may or may not survive and 
it probably is in our interest that he survive 
the others participating in the forum caspar weinberger melvin 
laird robert mcnamara frank carlucci and donald rumsfeld agreed 
that the soviet reform spirit might not last the panel discussion 
was sponsored by the nonprofit southern center for international 
studies in atlanta 
gorbachev and president bush were in malta to hold a weekend 
summit aboard us and soviet warships bush praised gorbachev 
friday as a dynamic new soviet leader whose policies of 
openness and other reforms are advancing the cause of world peace 
but weinberger who served as ronald reagans defense secretary 
from 1981 to 1987 warned the cold war is not over 
weinberger said the soviet union can transform soldiers into 
farmers and back again in a matter of days they can just as 
easily change their party leaders weinberger said 
he cited the reversal of what appeared to be democratic reforms 
in china when the army cleared tiananmen square of demonstrators 
the soviet union is quite capable of reversing these things 
like firing into crowds weinberger said 
still the former defense secretaries agreed that the opening of 
the berlin wall and relaxed travel in warsaw pact nations could 
lead to us troop reductions in europe and each said the united 
states should keep hands off any attempts at reunifying germany 
well be bringing americans home and youll be seeing that by 
the end of the year predicted laird richard nixons defense 
secretary from 1969 to 1973 
schlesinger said the changes sweeping europe are staggering 
the warsaw pact threat is quite different for that reason we 
can spend somewhat less than we have on our readiness posture in 
western europe and i stress somewhat less schlesinger said

scientists who began examining the 
carcasses of 100 laboratory monkeys imported from the philippines 
by a virginia firm say they have so far discovered three with the 
ebola virus considered the deadliest virus to humans before aids 
was discovered 
health officials also say they are monitoring the 25 employees 
at the virginia research firm that had received the monkeys in 
october even though they believe the disease would have turned up 
in the employees by now if any had been infected officials said 
none of the employees have shown any symptoms 
the monkeys had been shipped to hazleton research products of 
reston va a subsidiary of corning glass corp that uses primates 
for cosmetics and drug testing 
this is the first time the virus has been found in a nonhuman 
and the first time it had been found in the united states the 
discovery of the first infected monkey was announced earlier this 
week 
we dont know where they got the virus charles dasey a 
spokesman at the army medical research institute of infectious 
diseases at fort detrick in frederick md said friday 
were continuing to help hazleton and public health officials 
determine how far it has spread through the monkey colony he 
said 
in midnovember medical investigators helped hazleton determine 
that some of the monkeys suffered from simian hemorrhagic fever and 
that one monkey had the ebola virus all of the animals in the 
shipment were then destroyed authorities said 
since then 17 monkey carcasses have been sent to fort detrick 
for necropsies similar to autopsies in humans the first seven 
arrived wednesday and three including the initial animal had the 
virus 
ten more delivered friday have not been examined dasey said it 
was not immediately known when the remaining necropsies would be 
performed 
the ebola virus causes a contagious disease that is transmitted 
through body fluids and secretions though not through casual 
contact according to dr susan fishelhoch of the institute 
it was first identified in zaire in 1976 where over 500 people 
died 
the virus kills 50 percent to 90 percent of those it infects 
there is no vaccine 
health officials said friday that hazleton employees who had 
worked with the monkeys had worn surgical masks gowns and gloves 
on the job 
at this point i dont see where we have a health problem 
said barbara mitchell spokeswoman for the virginia department of 
health in richmond we probably would have seen something by now 
if someone was infected but were still taking every precaution we 
can 
mitchell said the 25 workers will be examined daily for the next 
three weeks in cooperation with the centers for disease control in 
atlanta

finances health care for the nations 33 million elderly and 
disabled 
the white house office of management and budget however wants 
to trim 81 billion from projected growth in the program through 
reductions in payments to doctors hospital reimbursement rates and 
other payments to hospitals for capital improvements and medical 
education 
an hhs source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the 
budgets of a number of programs including medicare are the

american health systems which represents private hospitals called 
the proposed cut ridiculous and said he doubted congress would 
go along

your uncontrollable cost increases means either reduced quality or 
reduced quantity either you cut services or the quality is going 
to suffer he said

care for the poor sullivan sought to expand eligibility to include 
pregnant women and infants up to 150 percent of the poverty level

the government dropped its sedition 
and racketeering case against three leading militants of the 1970s 
after three years and more than 2 million in trial costs 
us attorney wayne budd said friday he will not retry the case 
prosecutors claimed the radicals conspired to overthrow the 
government by force through a series of bombings and bank robberies 
given the amount of effort already expended in the 
investigation and prosecution and the effort that would be needed 
for a new trial i have decided that the best course is not to seek 
a retrial he said 
the federal jury cleared the three of sedition charges with a 
partial verdict monday then deadlocked on whether alleged bombing 
exploits constituted racketeering a mistrial on the racketeering 
charges was declared wednesday 
defendants raymond levasseur and richard williams will not go 
free because they are serving 45year sentences on convictions in a 
new york federal court on some of the bombings 
but the third defendant patricia levasseur has been released 
from prison after serving 3 years of a fiveyear federal term for 
harboring a fugitive her husband raymond 
i am grateful for my new life mrs levasseur said i 
think it was a very reasonable thing that the government is doing 
by not retrying this case and i want to thank the jury and the 
community that they come from here for having belief in my 
innocence 
defense attorneys were delighted 
im speechless after 2 years or whatever its been on this 
case its the right result and im a little bit overwhelmed that 
the government did the right thing in this case at this juncture 
said attorney kenneth king 
estimates of the trial costs ranged from 2 million to 10 
million much of it for the crew of us marshals brought in to 
maintain security 
the case began in may 1986 with an indictment against eight 
people on charges of seditious conspiracy racketeering and 
racketeering conspiracy each count carries a maximum term of 20 
years and 20000 in fines 
during the course of the case charges were dropped against two 
of the defendants who were already serving long prison terms two 
others pleaded guilty and charges were dropped against a fifth 
person after a judge suppressed evidence seized at her house 
by the start of trial in january only three defendants remained 
prosecutors claimed the three were members of an underground 
group which bombed courthouses and other facilities from 1976 to 
1984 in a plot to overthrow the us government they claimed the 
group robbed banks to finance their actions 
but the defense hailed the jurys rejection of the seditious 
conspiracy charges as vindication of their argument that the 
indictment in effect was for thought crimes and should never 
have been lodged 
the government has used the sedition statute only a few times 
since it was first invoked to punish confederates during the civil 
war according to arthur d wolf a professor at western new 
england college in springfield 
it was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft during 
world war i and to prosecute puerto rican nationalists accused in 
an assassination attempt against then president harry truman last 
april nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious 
conspiracy charges in arkansas

the defense department has ordered an 
immediate halt to all production spending on the v22 osprey the 
vertical takeoff plane the marines and members of congress want but 
the administration wants to cancel 
deputy defense secretary donald j atwood sent instructions 
friday to navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii to terminate 
forthwith all contracts financed out of the previous fiscal 
years 334 million for procurement said lt cmdr gregg hartung 
a department spokesman 
those contracts were for items that take a long time to supply 
the socalled long lead items 
though all 334 million had been obligated much of it remains 
unspent said hartung reading from atwoods memo 
congress this fiscal year refused the administrations request 
to kill the plane but did limit its appropriation of 255 million 
to research and development 
though the marines had placed a high priority on the osprey to 
ferry troops ashore from ships off landing beaches defense 
secretary dick cheney decided that the 27 billion needed for the 
desired fleet of aircraft could be better spent elsewhere and 
helicopters used for the ferry job 
backers of the plane to built near fort worth texas by a 
joint endeavor of boeing corp and bell helicopter textron argued 
that it could be enormously useful in easing airspace congestion 
around heavily used airports but critics retorted that if it were 
commercially valuable airlines and manufacturers would finance it 
themselves

the federal government halted operations at 
the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant to resolve safety questions 
including whether enough plutonium dust has accumulated in the 
pipes to cause an uncontrolled nuclear reaction 
energy secretary james watkins announced a major management 
shakeup at the plant and said it would not reopen until the 
government and the plants new contractor egampg inc are 
satisfied safety concerns have been met 
at a news conference at the plant 16 miles north of denver 
watkins said plutonium operations had been scaled back 20 percent 
and would be shut down altogether in the coming days 
watkins acknowledged that any longterm shutdown could seriously 
affect the united states nuclear weapons capability the plant is 
the only one of its kind in the united states that makes plutonium 
triggers for nuclear weapons other plants in the nuclear weapons 
industry that have been at least partly shut down in the last two 
years include the savannah river site in south carolina the 
plutonium processing plant at the hanford reservation in 
washington and the feed materials production center a uranium 
plant in ohio 
rocky flats has been plagued by safety accusations in recent 
years and is the target of a federal criminal probe that so far has 
not resulted in indictments earlier this fall doe terminated its 
management agreement with rockwell international corp and signed a 
new accord with egampg which is scheduled to take over fully jan 1 
after touring the plant watkins said although no major 
hardware problems were identified by the department of energy team 
conduct of operations standards of performance engineering 
support and management structure remain deficient 
among the safety concerns he cited was an october report issued 
by a team of independent investigators which found weapongrade 
plutonium in a pipe that serves as an exhaust ventilation duct at 
one of the plants main buildings 
initial reports indicated there was enough plutonium present 
about 12 pounds to cause criticality or a nuclear reaction 
but another study found there was less plutonium in the ducts than 
originally thought both reports said there was no evidence a 
reaction had occurred 
watkins said the criticality issue does not pose a public safety 
threat 
nevertheless because it is an important safety issue i am 
asking egampg to independently review the reports findings and 
produce their own action plan he said 
gov roy romer who was present at watkins news conference 
said the decision to shut down plutonium processing at rocky flats 
shows a new commitment by doe to safety he added 
its obvious that the proof is in the pudding and its my job 
as governor of colorado to make sure the citizens are safe 
rep david skaggs dcolo who earlier called for a complete 
shutdown at rocky flats said watkins seems to be taking a 
positive if somewhat uncertain step but in the right direction 
skaggs said it was unclear how the shutdown period at rocky 
flats would be evaluated and verified 
watkins admitted that doe made major mistakes at rocky flats 
we did not bring our management into the modern world and 
were going to do that now he said 
part of the shutdown period will be dedicated to safety 
training watkins said he said it would be necessary to regain 
public trust 
of course we have a credibility problem what we are trying to 
do now is regain it he said

a producer at nbcs today show says his 
deletion of an unfavorable reference to general electric co in a 
report on defective aircraft engine bolts had nothing to do with 
ges ownership of the network 
i definitely wasnt more careful because ge was involved 
executive producer marty ryan told the washington post in a story 
published today 
the original report said that ge a manufacturer of aircraft 
engines among other things accepted defective bolts from a 
supplier and for eight years did not require that the supplier 
certify the products quality 
the report broadcast thursday on the networks morning show 
mentioned other manufacturers but only the part pertaining to ge 
was cut the newspaper said ryan said an expanded spot about 
the ge allegations will air on the show next week 
ryan said he did not think the reporter peter karl of wmaqtv 
in chicago had journalistically covered all his bases the 
chicago station had prepared and originally aired the report 
ryan called the omission one of those things 
karl said he had been asked by today show producers whether 
he had contacted ge for comment on the report the reporter said he 
had done so on several occasions 
my view is that you make a mistake when you treat your 
employer differently than anybody else ron magers an anchorman 
at wmaq was quoted as saying

vishwanath pratap singh was sworn in as 
prime minister saturday to replace rajiv gandhi and the new leader 
said his first goal would be to bring dignity to india whose 
previous government was dogged by allegations of corruption 
president ramaswamy venkataraman who administered the oath of 
office at the presidential palace has given singh 30 days to prove 
his national front coalition can muster a vote of confidence in the 
new parliament 
gandhi now consigned to the role of opposition leader smiled 
as he approached singh after the 10minute ceremony he was one of 
the first to offer congratulations 
on friday singh also was elected parliamentary leader of the 
centrist national front and of the coalitions largest party the 
janata dal 
singhs selection came after lastminute conferences a 
fistfight and allegations of skullduggery within the front which 
is united by little more than antipathy to gandhi and the congress 
party 
it formed a cohesive opposition force to defeat gandhi in 
national elections nov 2226 
my first task is to restore the dignity of the country 
singh said friday we should make an india of which every indian 
will be proud 
the 58yearold former defense minister said foreign policy 
would remain largely unaltered and that the government would take 
the congress party into confidence on national issues 
the janata dal has 141 of the national fronts 144 seats in 
parliaments new policymaking lower house the other three seats 
went to smaller parties in the coalition gandhis party has 192 
seats and its allies have another 17 
the national front has also been promised support by the 
bharatiya janata party which has 88 seats and by a combination of 
leftwing groups which won 51 constituencies 
that would give the coalition and its tacit allies 283 seats 
enough to carry a vote of confidence in the government 
although the congress party has more seats than the national 
front it would have had more trouble forming a coalition 
gandhi became prime minister in 1984 after the assassination of 
his mother prime minister indira gandhi his aides predicted the 
new government will fall apart before its fiveyear term expires 
clearing the way for new elections and the congress partys return 
to power the party governed india for nearly all indias 42 years 
of independence 
the congress party said it would not stake a claim to form the 
government instead it appeared prepared to wait to see if singh 
could preserve a government with his ideologically diverse allies 
coalition members said thursday that singh a former defense 
minister was the only candidate for prime minister but singhs 
professed reluctance for the job spurred two other candidates 
chandra shekhar and devi lal to enter the fray 
a whirlwind of consultations began friday as singh and other 
leaders drove from house to house and office to office 
a few hours before singh was named prime minister riot police 
quelled fistfights between supporters of singh and chandra shekhar 
in the street outside chandra shekhars home 
ram jethmalani a senior member of the national front was 
punched and kicked by supporters of chandra shekhar when he got out 
of his car to begin a hunger strike aimed at persuading chandra 
shekhar to step aside in favor of singh 
the 78yearold jethmalani one of indias top criminal lawyers 
fell to the ground as the two sides traded punches 
chandra shekhar stalked out of the parliamtentary meeting after 
singh was chosen party leader 
singh was in gandhis cabinet until 1987 when he resigned amid 
reports his investigations into government corruption were proving 
embarrassing to the prime minister 
shortly afterward swedish and indian newspaper and radio 
reports disclosed the swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors paid as 
much as 50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a 14 
billion contract to supply the indian army with artillery guns 
gandhi vigorously denied wrongdoing and the charges have never 
been proved but they raised serious questions about the gandhis 
integrity and cost him popular support

researchers start clinical trials next month 
on a new vitamin a cream that researchers believe will smooth the 
small wrinkles from aging sundamaged skin without the irritating 
side effects of retin a 
dr thomas nigra chairman of dermatology at washington hospital 
center said the cream called pelretin has proven in animal tests 
to be able to restore wrinkled skin to a youthful look 
now he said friday the cream will be tested for six months on 
240 patients in three cities to see if it works on humans the 
results should be known in about a year but it may take up to four 
years before pelretin is approved for prescription use the 
researcher said 
the clinical tests were organized after pelretin was tested on 
rabbits and the rhino mouse a rodent that is genetically disposed 
to develop wrinkles early in life the results of the animal tests 
said nigra were dramatic 
pelretin said nigra is a first cousin to retin a a 
prescription cream that was developed to treat acne but which 
doctors discovered also is effective against skin wrinkling 
pelretin should offer an advantage over retin a because the 
early studies suggest it has a similar therapeutic response but 
with less side effects he said this is really a second 
generation of cosmetic pharmaceutical 
the side effects of retin a include a reddening of the skin 
scaling and flaking along with a burning sensation nigra said 
the doctor said pelretin has been through all of the studies 
to make sure it is a safe product to be used in human testing 
both retin a and pelretin contain a vitamin a compound that some 
researchers claim has been shown in tests to smooth aging damaged 
skin 
other dermatologists however claim that the creams only give 
the appearance of smoothing the skin and that the effects are not 
real 
nigra said his research with retin a demonstrates that the 
compound does remove some wrinkles giving what he called 
excellent results for 285 percent of patients who use the 
cream and good for 476 percent 
but he said about half of the patients who used the placebo also 
showed good results because we taught them how to take care 
of their skin 
nigra said laboratory tests have shown that vitamin a compounds 
do improve skin tone he said biopsies of skin treated with retin a 
show that it has a hormonal effect that causes skin tissue to 
thicken this in turn causes some wrinkles to smooth out 
volunteers for the clinical tests are being accepted at the 
washington hospital center and at hospitals in atlanta and san 
diego the study is to start jan 8 
nigra said the patients in the study must be white between 40 
and 70 years of age and have skin that has been moderately to 
severely damaged from a lifetime of exposure other races will be 
tested later he said although dark skins tend not to be easily 
damaged by the sun

nadia comaneci who vaulted gracefully into 
american hearts as a tiny gymnast performing airy gyrations in the 
1976 olympics has leaped what remains of the iron curtain to come 
live in america 
the 28yearold comaneci who defected from romania on tuesday 
flew here friday on the pan am plane liberty bell from vienna 
im very happy because im here in america and i wanted from 
long time to come here she said in halting english at a news 
conference at john f kennedy international airport i wanted to 
have a free life 
comaneci contacted a us embassy in europe on friday morning 
and was quickly granted refugee status said state department 
deputy spokesman richard boucher 
he added we certainly welcome ms comaneci 
asked how long she had thought about defecting she replied a 
long time i had it in my mind for a few years 
comaneci has traveled abroad frequently since becoming the first 
gymnast ever to score a perfect 10 at the olympics she won 21 gold 
medals altogether in olympic and other international meets during 
her career which earned her a life of privilege in a country that 
has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for most of this 
decade 
her defection tuesday to hungary was a blow to the hardline 
government of romanian president nicolae ceausescu who had named 
the gymnast a hero of socialist labor for her athletic 
accomplishments comaneci was held up as a role model for romanian 
youth 
when asked what political impact her defection will have on 
romania comaneci replied its not my business 
the refugee status means us officials believe comaneci has a 
wellfounded fear of persecution if she returns to romania where 
the government has rejected the reformist tide sweeping other east 
european countries 
comaneci was accompanied at the news conference by a man who 
appeared to be translating reporters questions for her she 
introduced konstantin panit by saying this is my friend who 
helped me to come here i want to thank him 
her former gymnastics coach bela karolyi left romania for the 
united states in 1981 and had encouraged comaneci earlier this week 
to follow his example 
i knew she was unsatisfied and unhappy about her personal 
situation he said i was very happy to know she chose freedom 
and decided to make this very difficult step 
karolyi said he suspects she will be bombarded by business 
propositions 
karolyi coached the then 14yearold comaneci during her perfect 
performances at the montreal games 
speaking from europe on friday karolyi said he planned to 
return to the united states on sunday to meet with comaneci 
possibly in indianopolis headquarters of the us gymnastics 
federation 
comaneci would be eligible to apply for permanent resident 
status in the united states in one year us officials who 
requested anonymity said 
comaneci accompanied by six other romanians crossed the border 
into hungary on tuesday and went into hiding she reportedly told a 
border guard she was leaving her homeland for the sake of 
freedom

roving bands of cunning red foxes are

the population seems to be exploding now for some reason and 
we are not sure why said larry sitton wildlife management 
supervisor of the state department of fish and game in los angeles 
this has resulted in a terrible terrible problem for native 
species pushing some to the brink of extinction red foxes have 
been spotted in torrance and el segundo and near the los angeles 
international airport they attack endangered birds such as the 
least tern and the clapper rail 
attempts to control the animal which is not native to the area 
have proved futile 
they are rather shy and wary of people said rudi mattoni a 
biologist the story about being foxy is no joke they are very 
difficult to catch 
sarah george a biologist with the natural history museum of los 
angeles county said no one really knows how the red fox a native 
of the sierra nevada got to this part of the state 
mattoni said despite her efforts up to 20 species of small 
animals have disappeared from the dunes just west of the airport 
because of the predators appetite 
remember how common it used to be to see rabbits on the 
runways mattoni asked well aint no more rabbits

the son of suspended navajo chairman 
peter macdonald appeared before a tribal court after special 
prosecutors asked for an arrest warrant to force his return to the 
reservation 
peter rocky macdonald jr pleaded innocent friday in navajo 
district court to conspiracy charges stemming from the tribes 1987 
purchase of a northern arizona ranch 
the younger macdonald had failed to show up at two other 
arraignments claiming that the tribal court had no jurisdiction 
over him because he no longer lives on the reservation and because 
the alleged crimes took place offreservation 
defense attorney donald benally told district judge robert 
yazzie the younger macdonalds failure to appear before was based 
on a misunderstanding 
but special prosecutor mark donatelli said the younger macdonald 
agreed to the arraignment when he realized that the tribal judge 
was planning to issue a bench warrant for his arrest and to start 
extradition proceedings against him 
i think he was just trying to see how far he could push the 
court donatelli said 
yazzie released the younger macdonald on his own recognizance 
but ordered him to have weekly contact with his lawyer 
the senior macdonald has been on paid administrative leave since 
feb 17 on wednesday he pleaded innocent to 107 criminal charges 
alleging he received more than 500000 in illegal contributions 
and kickbacks from 1986 to 1988 
the elder macdonald was charged by special prosecutors with 
conspiracy bribery fraud extortion and electionlaw violations 
the charges focus on the tribes purchase of the big boquillas 
ranch from nonindian middlemen who made a 72 million profit on 
the property

the us supreme court granted a 
request from both sides in an illinois abortion dispute to defer 
arguments in the case and a lower court was expected to approve an 
outofcourt settlement 
if it does so it would defuse tension from a case that had been 
viewed by legal experts as a likely opportunity for the high court 
to alter the 1973 roe v wade decision legalizing abortion 
because of this mornings action illinois is closer to having 
a set of regulations that guarantee the health and safety of women 
who choose to have an abortion illinois attorney general neil 
hartigan said in a statement friday 
the argument session in the case in which prochoice advocates 
opposed the states regulations governing abortion clinics had 
been scheduled for tuesday and many were awaiting the courts 
ruling with considerable anticipation 
the decision to defer arguments will keep the case on the 
supreme court docket in limbo until us district judge john 
nordburg acts on a settlement reached by the two sides and they 
ask the justices to dismiss the case 
the key issue in the illinois dispute is a set of strict 
regulations imposed on abortion clinics where most earlypregnancy 
abortions are performed 
opponents of the regulations including the illinois chapter of 
the american civil liberties union which successfully had 
challenged them in lower courts said they could severely have 
restricted the availability of abortions 
were gratified by the supreme court action in facilitating a 
settlement of the lawsuit said aclu attorney harvey grossman 
state rep penny pullen a leading abortion opponent said the 
courts move came as no big surprise 
i am not so sure whether our interests would have been served 
having mr hartigan argue the case in the supreme court anyway 
she said 
initially hartigan had sought to have the supreme court uphold 
the state regulations and the high court accepted the case for 
review last july 3 
that was the same day the justices announced in a missouri 
case a decision giving states greater authority to regulate 
abortions 
but hartigan a democratic candidate for governor in 1990 later 
sought a settlement in which illinois women would be guaranteed 
continued access to abortions 
the legal challenge to the abortion regulations was launched by 
dr richard ragsdale of rockford 
four years ago ragsdale won a preliminary injunction against 
the regulations in us district court in chicago contending that 
the states elaborate building codes for abortion clinics were 
medically unnecessary

president ghulam ishaq khan told a 
joint session of parliament today that one year after pakistans 
return to democracy high expectations have turned into despair 
he blamed most of poor public morale on the government of prime 
minister benazir bhutto 
in a toughly worded address to pakistans senate and national 
assembly ishaq said a year of trading abuses and inaction is 
starting to frustrate budding hopes 
ishaq 77 criticized ms bhuttos leftleaning government and 
its centerright political opposition for squandering opportunities 
to strengthen pakistans fragile democracy which followed 11 years 
of military rule 
instead of understanding and accommodation there has been 
confrontation at all levels and political horse trading he said 
a year ago there was a festive look faces were flushed with 
fresh resolve and new hope but now im honestly reflecting the 
feelings of millions of our people they are in the grip of agony 
and concern ishaq said in urdu 
ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party won the largest bloc of 
votes in november 1988 in the first free elections in more than a 
decade but an alliance of opposition parties won control of 
powerful punjab province 
ishaq said bitter squabbling between the two has given rise to 
the admonishment that the countrys legislators do everything but 
legislate 
he warned that democracy in developing nations has to be more 
than an intellectual exercise he said charges of corruption which 
have plagued ms bhuttos government and only incremental 
improvements in the quality of life will weaken he common mans 
faith in democracy 
in an interview after the presidents speech amnar piracha a 
peoples party lawmaker said 
we have to look at what went wrong and people may be 
upset but people have not lost faith in the democratic process 
she said ishaq who was closely aligned with his predecessor 
military president gen mohammad zia ulhaq has to rise above 
past affiliations and play a role in building relations between 
the federal and provincial governments 
the majority of the punjab lawmakers are also zia loyalists 
zia who overthrew ms bhuttos father in a 1977 coup died in an 
august 1988 plane crash which cleared the way for elections 
ishaq complained that ms bhuttos government has done little to 
carry on an islamization program launched by zia before his death 
zia was trying to introduce an islamic legal system linking state 
and religion 
ishaq also warned against parliamentarians changing allegiance 
in midterm which is illegal under pakistans constitution 
ms bhutto in november inducted three opposition members into 
her cabinet which generated opposition cries that her government 
was ignoring the rules the three however have maintained their 
original party affiliations 
on the positive side the president said ms bhuttos government 
has launched an economic renewal program that is making some 
progress particularly in keeping the inflation rate under control 
he said pakistans return to democracy has improved its 
international standing and brought economic benefits

deadly pancreatic cancer again has struck the 
family of former president carter prompting a leading cancer 
researcher to suggest regular testing for the entire clan 
gloria carter spann carters sister was released friday from 
emory university hospital in atlanta where the 62yearold plains 
resident was diagnosed with the ailment according to a statement 
from dr martin york 
mrs spann is the former presidents last surviving sibling his 
father james earl carter sr his brother billy carter and 
sister ruth carter stapleton each died of pancreatic cancer 
while only about 6 percent of pancreatic cancer victims have a 
family history of the disease those who do have it in the family 
are several times more likely to get it than the general 
population said dr henry p lynch a professor at creighton 
university school of medicine in omaha neb 
we recommend a cat scan of the pancreas or an ultrasound for 
people who are at very high risk such as jimmy said lynch who 
recently completed a study of 18 families with 47 members having 
pancreatic cancer 
lynch said research has shown that the carter family children 
could have a greater chance of developing pancreatic cancer a 
disease that has its onset after the late 40s 
part of the need for early screening he said is that when the 
cancer produce symptoms it may have been there growing more 
subtly for five or 10 years 
carters father died of pancreatic cancer in 1953 billy carter 
died of the disease in september 1988 at age 51 mrs stapleton was 
54 when she succumbed to the disease in september 1983 
carters mother miss lillian carter had breast cancer that 
had spread to other organs including her pancreas when she died 
in october 1983 at age 85 
mrs spann said in a statement released friday through the 
carter presidential center that she was not feeling any symptoms 
from the disease which was diagnosed during routine testing 
she said she was feeling great said center spokeswoman 
casie hughes in fact she and her husband walter are planning to 
ride their motorcycles to florida for the weekend 
researchers have found that pancreatic cancer is almost always 
fatal lynch said 
in spite of advances in chemotherapy radiation therapy and 
surgery most patients with pancreatic cancer do not survive more 
than a year he said

a continental airlines ad that ran in 
british publications pokes fun at boise the destination of a 
continental flight that crashed and killed 28 people two years ago 
the ad pitches 2for1 tickets from london to denver and other 
destinations 
admittedly there are a few places in the states that we dont 
fly to says the ad which ran about a month ago but be 
honest how often do you really need to go to boise idaho 
idahoans including gov cecil andrus boise mayor dirk 
kempthorne and victims of the denver crash on friday blasted what 
they called the airlines insensitivity 
fourteen idahoans died and 42 were injured in the nov 15 1987 
crash of flight 1713 
on friday james v odonnell continentals senior vice 
president of marketing programs in houston apologized and said the 
ad was changed immediately after he saw it 
im very sorry that it happened said odonnell who said 
the ad was crafted by a london agency unaware of the crash it 
was anything but intentional it was based on ignorance 
andrus slammed continental chairman frank lorenzo 
the ad is a cheap shot from a cheapskate andrus said 
unfortunately the real insult is that in 1987 a lot of people 
tried to fly from denver to boise on continental and many of them 
died or were injured the remark is grossly insensitive but then 
again what do you expect from frank lorenzo 
odonnell said the ad ran this fall in the london times the 
financial times the economist magazine and perhaps other 
publications it couldnt have run more than a handful of 
times he said 
dave daniel of melba was on flight 1713 and his wife tami was 
killed it just confirms your feelings about how callously and 
poorly continental is run all theyre thinking about is the bottom 
line he said 
continental pulled out of boise and seven other airports in 
september of 1988 saying it would focus on more profitable 
destinations continentals departure from boise came 10 months 
after the flight 1713 crash

president bushs decision to provide air 
coverage to the philippine government during its latest 
insurrection could further complicate the issue of future american 
military presence in the islands analysts say 
committing us planes to help president corazon aquinos 
government might make the six american military bases in the 
islands more of a terrorist target for some radical critics of the 
philippine government said one analyst richard fisher of the 
heritage foundation a conservative think tank 
but fisher said the quick us agreement to mrs aquinos 
request for help could also favorably influence her government 
in negotiations starting in about two weeks on a possible extension 
of the bases treaty set to expire in 1991 
recognizing strong political opposition to continuing the us 
military presence mrs aquino has not yet declared whether she 
favors prolonging the base arrangement many us officials predict 
a new treaty eventually will be approved 
john melegrito a prominent filipinoamerican said it would 
have been wrong not to accept us help against the rebels if 
philippines democracy were truly at stake and the question now 
is what will be the price it will add pressure on the government 
as it enters into negotiations an added complication 
the washingtonbased christian coalition for philippines human 
rights issued a statement of concern that the use of american air 
power in a coup situation may be used in upcoming base talks to 
signify continued philippine dependence on the us military 
presence it quoted manila analysts as saying reluctance of 
philippine pilots to fire on their rebel colleagues was one 
reason us planes were needed for air coverage 
melegrito organized a demonstration of more than 50 people 
outside washingtons philippine embassy friday that supported the 
aquino government and at the same time urged it to deal more 
harshly than in the past with plotters who have attempted at least 
five previous coups 
along with long live cory chants and slogans there were 
speeches and placards demanding no amnesty for traitors lock 
them behind bars 
congress was in recess but bipartisan support for president 
bushs decision to provide air support for the manila government 
came from those reached for comment 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called 
president bushs decision to provide air support prudent and in 
our national interest a country might be justified to use 
revolution and military insurrection to rid itself of dictatorship 
mitchell said but the philippines is a democracy 
if there are elements in the philippines who disagree with 
aquinos policies they have a means to change the government 
through election mitchell said 
president bush took the kind of measured action required in 
a situation where philippines democracy was hanging in the 
balance and the safety of the civilian population was at stake

asiapacific subcommittee

a treasure trove of artifacts looted from an 
ancient peruvian gravesite is going home after months of legal 
wrangling following raids on southern california art collectors 
us customs service agents delivered six crates carrying 123 
precolombian artifacts to los angeles international airport for 
shipment friday night customs spokesman mike fleming said 
the artifacts include one piece believed to be 8000 years old 
fleming said representatives of the peruvian government told 
us officials the objects of ceramic wood stone fiber and metal 
have an intrinsic value of 1 million but their historical value 
is priceless 
peruvian president alan garcia was scheduled to be on hand to 
receive the stolen national treasures upon their arrival in lima 
the artifacts were stolen from perus sipan tomb an ancient 
burial site more than two years ago said john miller another 
customs spokesman 
theyve compared the site in significance to king tuts in 
egypt because its a site they werent previously aware of and it 
included royalty miller said a lot of the site is intact and 
it will tell a lot more about how people lived and died 
some of the most valuable items displayed at a news conference 
friday include gold ear spools and a ceramic sculpture of a man 
cutting his own throat 
they were among 1300 seized in march 1988 raids on eight 
dealers and collectors one dealer was convicted of making a

an asian elephant who earlier underwent an 
unprecedented caesarean section died during emergency surgery at 
the san diego wild animal park 
a team of veterinarians worked on jean the 19yearold 
7000pound elephant for about three hours friday in hopes of 
alleviating complications caused by the death of the fetus in her 
womb but in the end there was nothing they could do to save her 
park spokesman tom hanscom said 
the elephant was destroyed with a fatal dose of anesthetic while 
still unconscious for the surgery he said 
jean had been fighting a severe abdominal infection caused by 
the dead 300pound fetus which was removed nov 20 during the 
first caesarean section known to have been performed on an elephant 
after the infection started veterinarians fed jean 
intravenously and gave her antibiotics and pain killers but her 
condition did not improve and veterinarians operated again friday 
night in a lastditch attempt to save the pachyderms life 
veterinarians attempted to repair the uterus they were unable 
to do so they also attempted to do a hysterectomy but were unable 
to do that because of its size and inaccessibility hanscom said 
jean had made the record books after being pregnant for more 
than 730 days surpassing the pregnancy of an asian elephant that 
gave birth at a zoo in germany after 720 days the normal gestation 
period for the asian elephant is between 618 and 648 days 
if there is any positive sign to the ordeal in our attempt to 
save her life we have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge that 
we can hopefully apply to the care of other elephants hanscom

work 
he told reporters he was feeling pretty good and that he 
slept fine just fine piece of cake 
white house officials said bush awoke at 7 am this morning 
and at a breakfast meeting was given a detailed report on the 
situation in the philippines by secretary of state james a baker 
iii white house chief of staff john sununu and brent scowcroft 
the national security adviser 
in manila renewed fighting was reported today as government 
warplanes and helicopters hit remaining rebel positions rebels 
were reported still holding an air base in the central philippines 
and hundreds were gathered outside armed forces headquarters in 
manila and in the citys financial district but the aquino 
government said the coup attempt had been defeated 
since arriving in malta early friday bush has divided his time 
between preparations for his meetings with gorbachev and updates on 
the attempt by rebel military officials to topple the government of 
corazon aquino bush at the request of mrs aquino ordered us 
fighter jets friday to provide air cover and help the government 
defend against the coup attempt 
bush was already over the atlantic ocean on his way to malta 
when mrs aquino asked for us air cover to halt rebel air attacks 
and keep the mutineers pinned down in two air bases they 
controlled a few hours earlier the rebels had bombed the 
presidential palace in the most serious effort to bring down mrs 
aquino since she came to power in 1986 
the president approved the request from aboard air force one at 
1230 pm manila time 1130 pm edt and the decision was 
relayed to mrs aquino an hour later from washington by vice 
president dan quayle said roman popadiuk deputy press secretary 
the process went well under very difficult circumstances 
popadiuk said noting that the request came late at night while 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii were both in flight 
in addition to the air force f4 phantom jets providing air 
cover 100 marines were sent from a us base to protect the us 
embassy in manila popadiuk said 
there are no reports of any injuries to americans or any 
attacks on americans he said 
in washington pentagon spokesman pete williams said no us 
planes had fired any shots or intercepted any rebel aircraft 
even limited us military intervention could give gorbachev a 
rejoinder to complaints bush planned to lodge about soviet military 
involvement in afghanistan el salvador nicaragua and elsewhere 
arkady maslennikov a spokesman for the supreme soviet 
criticized bushs decision 
any interference in internal developments especially by 
outside powers is destructive and leads to deterioration of the 
situation he said in any event the best thing is to allow 
the filipinos themselves to sort it out 
popadiuk said bushs motive was twofold a democratic 
government has asked for assistance we have american lives to 
protect

two southern pacific freight trains collided 
today knocked eight cars into a swamp and forced the evacuation of 
more than 50 people for fear hazardous materials were leaking 
but authorities quickly determined there was no leak and 
everyone was allowed to return home said capt sam zinna a 
sheriffs spokesman there were no injuries 
zinna said it happened as one train with 106 cars en route from 
houston to new orleans on the main line passed a spur line new 
orleans is about 15 miles to the east he said the train on the 
spur line was waiting for the main track to clear but was slowly 
backing and hit the rear cars of the passing train 
eight tank cars carrying flammable hazardous materials 
including liquefied petroleum gas were derailed from the main 
line and fell into the swamp along the tracks on their sides zinna 
said 
two empty flatcars on the rear of the spur line train were 
knocked off the tracks but didnt overturn he said 
people within one mile were temporarily evacuated he estimated 
50 to 75 people were evacuated from the area which has a sparse 
population 
the derailed tank cars will be unloaded into other tank cars 
before the job of righting them that will probably take all 
weekend zinna said

communist leaders paving the way 
for a new government have developed a blueprint for reform that 
charts a course for the future and dramatically alters the official 
view of the past 
vasil mohorita a member of the ruling politburo unveiled an 
action program friday for the party that meets some of the 
demands of opposition groups who have spurred historic change in 
the country 
in bratislava an estimated 60000 demonstrators friday 
celebrated the sudden changes in czechoslvakia the crowd braved 
freezing temperatures for 2 hours to cheer speakers invoking the 
need for unity in achieving democracy in czechoslovakia 
the politburo plan announced by mohorita changes the official 
communist party view that the warsaw pact invasion that crushed the 
1968 prague spring reforms was justified 
we are of the opinion that the intervention of five countries 
in 1968 was not justified and the decision to do it was wrong 
mohorita said at a news conference 
mohorita said no decision had yet been made on another 
opposition demand to end direct communist control of the workplace 
the draft also pledges the communists will not interfere with 
the media mohorita said 
the proposed government plan outlines the new position of 
the party following a vote by parliament wednesday scrapping 
constitutional provisions guaranteeing the party a monopoly on 
power mohorita said 
the program has to be approved by the partys central committee 
and be adopted by a party congress tentatively scheduled for jan 
26 
the central committee is scheduled to meet on dec 14 mohorita 
said and could vote to hold the congress sooner 
the party daily rude pravo reported friday that the politburo 
had ordered the creation of a special commission to reevaluate the 
1968 reforms and the circumstances under which the armies of five 
socialist countries entered czechoslovakia 
the commissions report would augment the decision already taken 
by the politburo mohorita said 
the news came a day after more radical reversals of previous 
policy czechoslovakia announced it would remove part of its border 
with austria and lifted virtually all restrictions on travel to the 
west 
the interior ministry said friday that work on dismantling the 
grim barbed wire watchtowers and trip wire along sections of the 
border with austria would likely not begin until the second half of 
december 
meanwhile senior government official frantisek pitra renewed 
talks with dissident vaclav havel on forming a new government that 
will include noncommunists the composition of the government is 
to be announced by sunday 
party chief karel urbanek backed the decision to review the 1968 
reforms which were introduced by liberal party leader alexander 
dubcek who was ousted in disgrace after the invasion 
mohoritas statement from the politburo paved the way for a 
possible reassessment of the reforms and invasion by the warsaw 
pact at meeting in moscow next week following the malta summit of 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
east germany poland and hungary have said the invasion was 
wrong the soviet union and bulgaria have not and gorbachev has 
said a reevaluation by the warsaw pact alliance could take place 
only if requested by czechoslovakia 
in milan italy on friday gorbachev did say the prague 
spring reform movement of 1968 was right at that time and is 
right now but he stopped short of apologizing for the invasion 
mohorita said there would have to be a new attitude toward 
former leaders but he did not say if that referred to dubcek or 
hardliners who took charge after the liberal leadership was ousted 
dubcek has been cheered as a hero by thousands of people at 
prodemocracy rallies the hardliners who ousted him were removed 
in a party shakeup last week following 11 days of demonstrations

the maxim gorky site of the first 
summit talks between president bush and mikhail s gorbachev is 
the soviets most luxurious cruise ship and the kremlin leaders 
floating hotel for the malta meeting 
todays summit talks were to have been held on the slava a 
soviet guided missile cruiser rolling at anchor within sight of the 
slightly larger cruise ship but rough weather prompted officials 
to shift to the gorky which was brought to malta to house the 
soviet entourage 
gorbachev and his wife raisa spent friday night aboard the 
630foot luxury passenger liner which is tied up to a pier in the 
windswept marsaxlokk bay 
the whitehulled ship which boasts 12 decks heated outdoor and 
indoor swimming pools and a sauna deck with medicinal baths is 
distinguished by the yellow hammer and sickle painted on a red band 
around the single smokestack 
the two presidents met in the card room on the promenade deck 
the gorky named for the soviets most famous revolutionary 
writer was built in west germany 20 years ago and purchased by the 
soviets black sea shipping co in 1974 it has been used since to 
generate hard currency by carrying west germans and other foreign 
tourists on north sea cruises 
westerners who have sailed aboard the ship say it offers very 
good service uncharacteristic of soviet tourist enterprises and 
relatively inexpensive cruises 
the luxury liner struck an iceflow in the arctic off norway last 
june forcing evacuation of the 575 passengers and most of the 377 
crew members norwegian vessels took the evacuees on board and no 
one was reported injured 
the ship underwent extensive repairs and refurbishing after the 
accident and is reported to have been modernized and fitted with 
even more luxurious compartments than it had before 
izvestia the soviet government newspaper reported at the time 
the gorky was one of the biggest and technically bestequipped 
passenger ships of the soviet maritime fleet

the armenian legislature has voted to annex a 
disputed region in a neighboring republic an activist said today 
in a move that defied the federal government and could cause 
further ethnic violence 
the lawmakers claimed the region the nagornokarabakh enclave 
on friday after the national parliament asked armenias neighbor 
the republic of azerbaijan to quell tensions over the area the 
activist said 
the armenian supreme soviet and the national council of 
nagornokarabakh informed the national government of the 
annexation the activist karen shakhbazyan said in a telephone 
interview 
the national government probably will not recognize the action 
taken in the armenian capital yerevan 
nagornokarabakhs population is predominantly ethnic armenian 
and christian but the mountainous region is located in azerbaijan 
which is mostly moslem despite being called a soviet autonomous 
region the enclave is supposed to obey the azerbaijani government 
in baku 
unconfirmed reports earlier in the week said three people were 
killed in violence stemming from the dispute adding to dozens who 
have been killed in the past 18 months 
shakhbazyan speaking from yerevan said many armenian deputies 
will boycott the second session of the national congress of 
peoples deputies which begins dec 12 in moscow 
he accused azerbaijan of imposing a new rail blockade on armenia 
like the one that halted shipment of fuel food and other goods 
this fall 
no trains had arrived from nakhichivan a small area of 
azerbaijan sandwiched between armenia and iran since nov 28 he 
said trains were arriving on schedule from the georgian republic 
in the north he reported 
the armenian population citing what they call years of willful 
neglect by azerbaijan began demanding in february 1988 that 
armenia annex nagornokarabakh area 
mosow has rejected that demand and in january it imposed direct 
rule through a commission headed by arkady volsky 
on tuesday the final day of the national supreme soviets fall 
session legislators replaced the volsky commission with a 
legislative oversight commission 
the supreme soviet also ordered azerbaijan to work with local 
officials in nagornokarabakh to restore order in the meantime 
interior ministry soldiers are to stay in the area 
azerbaijani activists have expressed displeasure with the 
decision as well 
ekhtibar mamedov leader of the azerbaijan peoples front 
political movement claimed there was a secret provision in the 
supreme soviet declaration that prevents azerbaijan from 
interfering in armenias affairs

hundreds of museums and galleries throughout the country 
observed aids awareness day by holding memorial services 
temporarily removing art masterpieces to symbolize the diseases 
ravages in the arts community 
the point of a day without art is to refer metaphorically to 
loss and to try to get more people as concerned with the loss from 
aids as it is often with say earthquakes and other tragedies 
that occur said philip yenawine director of education at the 
museum of modern art in new york and cochairman of the nationwide 
project 
some 600 art institutions participated in the friday observance 
organizers said a group of arts professionals called visual aids 
organized a day without art to coincide with the world health 
organizations second aids awareness day 
elsewhere nearly 80 people were arrested in a protest in 
washington and new england corporate leaders convened in boston to 
discuss how the business world can better respond to the aids 
epidemic 
in new york numerous art galleries closed for the day or 
temporarily darkened their halls at the metropolitan museum of 
art picassos portrait of gertrude stein was removed and a 
placard was put in its place to explain the loss the art community 
is experiencing because of aids 
elizabeth taylor chairwoman of the american foundation for aids 
research told reporters at the museum of modern art that the 
observance was just a small reminder of the plague and everybody 
in this world needs to be reminded time and time again 
at a 14th street subway station artist ross lewis encouraged 
people to put the names of dead friends on index cards and tape 
them to black paper with which he had covered a colorful mural 
about 100 demonstrators marched in front of the new york office 
of the immigration and naturalization service to protest the us 
policy of forcing hivinfected immigrants to get a special waiver 
at the university of maine museum of art in orono workers 
draped the artwork in black 
there are huge social losses and artistic losses in the art 
world because of aids said charles shepard museum director 
similar observances were held in atlanta where the arts 
exchange gallery was closed in pittsburgh where lights were 
dimmed for 10 minutes at the carnegie museum of art in seattle 
where large black shrouds were hung over many downtown sculptures 
and in los angeles where visitors to the museum of contemporary 
art and the county museum of art found the usual admission fees 
waived and were asked instead to donate to the aids project los 
angeles 
in new orleans the noaids task force displayed childrens 
artistic conception of aids one simply had the word choose 
between the words aids and life said lisa lee a member of 
the task force 
in washington nearly 80 demonstrators were arrested friday 
after they sat down on pennsylvania avenue in front of the white 
house to protest what they called the governments lack of 
leadership in the aids epidemic 
those taking part in the civil disobedience were among some 200 
people who attended an earlier rally criticizing president bush for 
what they said was the governments inadequate support for aids 
research and services 
at a conference at bostons world trade center business leaders 
attended a variety of seminars on how to deal with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in the workplace 
a lot more things like these need to be done said william 
baumhaur president of the fuddruckers hamburger chain and keynote 
speaker at the conference every business will be impacted by 
aids we cant ignore it 
as of the end of october the federal centers for disease 
control in atlanta had recorded 112241 cases of aids in the united 
states with 66493 deaths 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
most often through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by 
drug abusers infected blood or blood products and from pregnant 
women to their offspring

two events this past week called attention to a 
new headache of the technological era the cost of reducing human 
exposure to electromagnetic radiation 
on monday international business machines corp confirmed that 
it cut radiation from its new largecomputer terminals to comply 
with requests from european customers 
on wednesday a researcher from johns hopkins university said 
she had found a link between cancer and human exposure to 
electromagnetic fields from power lines 
the twin developments highlighted public concerns about whether 
electricity the lifeblood of modern society could be harming 
the people it is intended to serve 
most of the discussion so far has focused on whether 
electromagnetic radiation really is harmful and in what amounts 
but even if the early warnings turn out to be overstated a 
movement to reduce human exposure to it seems to be well under way 
the questions are what steps can be taken to cut exposure and 
how much will they cost the reassuring answer is that many steps 
can be taken easily and cheaply even daunting problems may prove 
easier to solve than many think 
louis slesin who began putting out microwave news in new york 
city a decade ago said the latest developments carry conflicting 
messages 
on the bad side he said the johns hopkins study indicated 
biological effects from alarmingly low levels of electromagnetic 
radiation 
but on the good side the new ibm displays show that cutting 
radiation at least in the case of video display terminals does 
not always have to be expensive an ibm official said this past 
week that the new displays were built about as inexpensively as the 
old ones 
ibm incidentally says it produced the new displays only to 
satisfy customer demands not because of any health concerns so 
far no other companies have followed suit 
ibms new terminals dont reduce radiation at a frequency of 60 
hertz cycles per second the frequency that has been implicated 
in several medical studies including the one at johns hopkins 
sixty hertz radiation is emitted by all kinds of electrical 
devices from hair dryers to coffeemakers to larger 
electricitypowered machines 
fortunately early studies indicate that any danger is mainly 
from longterm exposure at sufficiently close ranges the fields of 
most devices drop off sharply a few inches away and people dont 
spend all day with them 
electric blankets and electrically heated water beds would seem 
to be possible problems although underwriters laboratories says it 
has no reason to believe they are dangerous there may be better 
ways to stay warm at night advises a valuable new 45page booklet 
from the department of engineering and public policy at 
carnegiemellon university in pittsburgh 
likewise the hazard of video display terminals if any can be 
minimized by keeping an arms length from the screen and a greater 
distance from neighboring terminals 
there may even be relatively inexpensive ways to deal with power 
lines both the longdistance transmission lines and the 
highcurrent distribution lines that go straight into populated 
areas 
according to slesin one way to cut power lines fields is 
disarmingly simple anchor two wires side by side as in the 
average extension cord their alternating current fields should 
substantially cancel each other out 
utilities have gotten interested because the publics fear of 
electromagnetic fields has contributed to long delays in building 
transmission lines even longer than the notorious delays in 
building new generating plants 
power lines will be the knottiest problem of all said paul 
brodeur a new yorker magazine writer and author of the newly 
published currents of death a critical study of the 
electromagnetic radiation issue 
still brodeur said we live in a vey advanced technological 
nation now that the cold war appears to be coming to an end this 
is not all that big of a deal 
slesin agreed ill make you a bet that with a couple years of 
research the electrical utilities will be able to reduce magnetic 
fields from power lines at relatively low cost by restringing and 
rewiring the power lines 
i have great confidence in the ingenuity of american 
engineers slesin said we can solve problems if we decide 
theyre worth solving 
in other business and economic news this past week 
opec ministers meeting in vienna settled on a production plan 
that they hope will control surging oil output and head off an 
expected price slump its success depends on whether some major 
persian gulf producers such as the united arab emirates abide by 
their output limits 
the government revised its estimate of thirdquarter economic 
growth upward to 27 percent but many economists said they 
expected much slower growth in the current quarter according to 
another report personal spending fell 02 percent in september 
the first drop in more than a year

the federal reserve didnt come through with a 
widely expected cut in interest rates this past week but investors 
remained optimistic anyway and stock prices rose 
this was the first sign since the oct 13 minicrash that the 
stock market has accepted bad news with any grace said wall 
street analyst john d connolly of dean witter reynolds inc 
the renewed optimism grew out of the latest economic indicators 
that point to a fourthquarter economic slowdown and expectations 
that the federal reserve will cut shortterm interest rates to 
stimulate growth 
data on octobers personal spending and leading indicators and 
the outlook for november manufacturing growth all declined while 
last months jobless claims rose 
we now live under the perverse perception that whats bad for 
the economy is good for the market under the guise that the fed 
will lower interest rates said dennis jarrett technical analyst 
with kidder peabody amp co 
the fed jolted the financial markets monday by signaling that it 
was not intentionally lowering shortterm interest rates contrary 
to popular speculation the loud and clear message came in the form 
of the fed draining funds from the banking system which pushed 
shortterm rates higher 
the assumption that the fed was allowing shortterm rates to 
fall grew out of a sharp drop the previous week in the federal 
funds rate the interest banks charge each another for overnight 
loans 
the new thinking since monday is that the fed will lower rates 
albeit more slowly than expected thereby stimulating the economy 
and bolstering sagging corporate profits in the new year 
analysts said this weeks stock market activity pointed to a 
growing optimism following several weeks of uncertainty since oct 
13 when the dow jones industrial average tumbled more than 190 
points many investors had shied away from any kind of commitment 
though some bluechip stocks have been strong as reflected in 
the dow average the timidity was evident in the broader market 
which has languished stocks that have performed best are the 
larger capitalization issues companies with reputations for 
longterm uninterrupted growth 
theres still some apprehension but growing confidence 
said hugh johnson senior vice president at first albany corp 
the reason the market has been this good in the face of a slowing 
economy is because it anticipates that the slowdown wont last that 
long because the fed will take steps to lower shortterm rates 
further fueling the argument for lower interest rates is a 
growing consensus among economists that real gnp growth will slow 
to roughly 15 percent in the final quarter of 1989 from 27 
percent in the previous three months analysts said 
a surprise rally on friday ahead of the weekend ussoviet 
summit helped boost the dow jones average to a 274765 closing on 
the week up 7210 points from the previous week and the 10th 
highest finish ever 
volume on the big board averaged 16057 million shares a day up 
from a daily average of 12702 million the week before 
the new york stock exchange composite index closed the week up 
337 at 19366 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter 
market advanced to 457 up 047 and the american stock exchange 
market value index added 244 to 37558 
analysts said the outlook for the market is positive as the year 
draws to a close and some said they hope for a santa claus 
rally two stimulants may help fuel the upward momentum said 
alfred e goldman vice president of ag edwards amp sons inc in 
st louis 
professional money managers get a big inflow of corporate 
profit and pension fund money that gets invested goldman said 
secondly the christmas spirit makes people feel good 
however goldman and other analysts say the market might have to 
give more ground first markets just dont go straight up

one of worlds longest insurgencies 
formally ended today as guerrillas of the communist party of malaya 
pledged to lay down their arms and vowed loyalty to malaysia 
ceasefire agreements signed by the communists malaysia and 
thailand brought to a close 41 years of conflict that cost 
thousands of lives and at one time involved 70000 british and 
commonwealth troops 
analysts in thailand and malaysia said meager prospects for 
success changes sweeping the communist world and perhaps chinas 
reluctance to be linked to the insurgency led to the ceasefire 
under the agreements 1200 guerrillas who operate mostly along 
the rugged 375mile frontier are to lay down their arms and return 
to civilian life 
the communist partys generalsecretary chin peng pledged 
loyalty to the malaysian government we shall disband our armed 
units and destroy our weapons to show our sincerity to terminate 
the armed struggle he said 
a joint communique said the communists had agreed to terminate 
all armed activities and bring peace to the entire thaimalaysian 
border and malaysia 
the communique said thailand and malaysia will ensure fair 
treatment for the disbanded communists who began their war of 
liberation in 1948 when britain ruled what was then called malaya 
as a colony 
the government of malaysia will in due course allow former 
members of the disbanded armed units to freely participate in 
political activities within the framework of the federal 
constitution and the laws of malaysia the statement said 
the communists in turn pledged to respect the laws of the two 
countries and to participate in social and economic development 
chin peng said the agreements were consistent with the current 
historical trend where the peoples of the whole world are striving 
for peace and democracy 
on the eve of the ceremony police lifted a 41yearold curfew 
in many parts of malaysia because they said there was no longer any 
threat from the guerrillas 
the statement said two agreements were reached one between 
malaysia and the communist party and the other between thailands 
internal security operations command and the communists 
the ceremony took place in hat yai a southern thai city 30 
miles from the malaysian border 
chin peng who was last seen outside the communist world in 
1955 signed the agreements along with thailands army commander

in the late 1940s and 1950s the commonwealth mobilized 70000 
troops to fight the largely ethnic chinese insurgents and the 
britishled force drove them into the jungle along the 
thaimalaysian border 
the british effort ended in 1960 after the deaths of more than 
10000 on both sides but fighting on a lesser scale continued 
through the next decade culminating with several successful 
thaimalaysian border sweeps and a thai amnesty that enticed large 
numbers of guerrillas to surrender 
despite the peace agreement malaysia has no plans to do away 
with internal security measures that allow for indefinite detention 
without trial 
prime minister mahathir mohamad told reporters friday that the 
law had helped maintain peace in a multiracial country 
critics of mahathir say the law is used to arrest activists who 
oppose government policies about 65 people are being held under 
the law 
of malaysias 17 million people 55 percent are malays 37 
percent are chinese and almost all the rest are indians

toward democracy after four decades of rule by the nationalists 
who lost a civil war to communist forces on the chinese mainland in 
1949 it was the first election to include opposition candidates 
and will test the opposition democratic progressive party 
legalized at the end of martial law in 1987 
results were expected early sunday in all 722 candidates ran

legitimate government of all china

a top communist party official resigned today 
and accused the east german leadership of being incapable of 
overseeing the political and economic reforms demanded by the 
prodemocracy movement 
the resignation of central committee secretary hansjoachim 
willerding was another blow to embattled party chief egon krenz 
who has been trying to gain respect for the party as it faces a 
challenge to its 40year monopoly on power 
willerding stepped down a day after the east german public was 
told how top party leaders took bribes lived opulent lifestyles 
went on luxury vacations and squirreled away billions of dollars in 
swiss bank accounts 
willerding told the official adn news agency that he had no 
confidence the leadership could gain the authority to lead the 
drive for democratic change 
renewal is possible only when the communist party leads with 
unity and determination he said 
he called for swift action against former leaders who abused 
their powers 
willerding was named secretary of the powerful central committee 
and a nonvoting member of the ruling politburo less than a month 
ago after erich honeckers longtime government was forced to 
resign 
krenz 52 has been trying desperately to distance himself from 
the old guard of which had been a prominent member 
shaking their heads in disbelief and disgust members of 
parliament listened friday to a litany of corruption involving 
leaders who rigidly maintained a spartan society for their people 
while indulging in excess 
during a nationally televised session that ran late into friday 
night krenz declared his partys guilt but sought to separate his 
new leadership from the disgraced figures now ousted from power 
nevertheless he took responsibility for the partys alleged 
misuse of power in 40 years of uncontested rule 
gross political errors have been committed by my party 
krenz told the parliamentary session as leader of the politburo 
and the central committee i take responsibility for this 
the party newspaper neues deutschland commented today this is 
all the more painful and incomprehensible in that these people for 
decades handed out to others the bread of poverty 
the newspaper declared the old guard communists to be guilty of 
outright grabbing and misuse of power corruption coverups and 
acts for which there can be no understanding and no forgiveness 
heinrich toeplitz head of the commission investigating abuse of 
power told parliament that honecker and other ousted leaders spent 
huge sums on hunting lodges luxury homes and other indulgences 
toeplitz confirmed that accusations against the ousted leaders 
disclosed before his investigative commission suggest that 100 
billion marks 54 billion has been spirited out of the country to 
swiss bank accounts 
the official news agency adn said the full 163member communist 
party central committee would meet sunday to weigh necessary 
consequences on the situation in the party it could decide to 
expel honecker and others implicated in the corruption reports 
toeplitzs disclosures led to demands that foreign trade 
minister gerhard beil immediately explain the whereabouts of that 
money 
i cannot explain this right now and you wouldnt want me to 
be able to beil contended saying a broad investigation is 
needed 
he was stopped with shouts of why not and accusations that 
he and others held over from the former leadership were part of the 
problem 
former politburo members guenter mittag and guenther kleiber 
were singled out as having pocketed bribes and kickbacks for 
imported goods purchased at state expense 
mittag already has been ousted from the party 
krenz pledged that past mistakes will be corrected but 
anticommunist sentiment has been spreading rapidly in the nation 
of more than 16 million 
the city council of plauen demanded that krenz resign over his 
alleged role in faking results of municipal elections last summer 
that gave the communists an overwhelming majority 
krenz is facing growing challenges to his leadership from both 
the opposition and his own party because of his longtime 
association with the honecker regime 
krenz honeckers handpicked successor took power oct 18 
after most of the old leaders were ousted by a wave of unrest and 
the exodus of hundreds of thousands of citizens to the west 
since then the leadership has instituted sweeping reform 
including lifting travel barriers and opening the berlin wall 
the communists are struggling to regain political initiative 
before the dec 7 start of talks with the opposition on the 
nations future course the party has also scheduled an emergency 
congress for dec 1517 
at fridays parliament session the communists were stripped of 
their guaranteed leading role mandated by the constitution for 
40 years 
the legislature also passed a resolution regretting east 
germanys decision to join in the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of 
czechoslovakia that crushed the shortlived prague spring 
reform era 
the resolution offered apologies to the people of czechoslovakia 
and expressed solidarity with the process of reforms going on 
there czechoslovakias prliament abolished the communists leading 
role wednesday

vishwanath pratap singh who led an 
opposition coalition to defeat the gandhi government was sworn in 
today as indias prime minister 
singh 58 a former king who now heads the fiveparty national 
front coalition will preside over the first minority government 
india has had since it became independent from britain 42 years ago 
devi lal 75 also of the national front was sworn in as deputy 
prime minister 
singh a poet and painter must now name his other cabinet 
ministers and win a vote of confidence from the majority of the 525 
members of parliaments policymaking lower house he has 30 days 
to prove his support in parliament 
president ramaswamy venkataraman administered the oath of 
office and singh smiled as the crowd in an ornate chamber of the 
presidential palace burst into applause 
i will do my duty singh told reporters after the 10minute 
ceremony my government will be a government of the people 
former prime minister rajiv gandhi now consigned to the role of 
opposition leader was one of the first to offer congratulations 
i wish him well he said i hope he completes his fiveyear 
term 
singh was gandhis finance and defense minister until 1987 when 
he resigned amid reports his investigations into government 
corruption were proving embarrassing to gandhi 
one of gandhis last acts was to free a sikh member of 
parliament who was accused of plotting the 1984 assassination of 
gandhis mother prime minister indira gandhi united news of india 
reported 
the government today withdrew all charges against simranjit 
singh mann and four others the shots that killed mrs gandhi on 
oct 31 1984 were fired by two of her sikh bodyguards one was 
shot to death by other bodyguards the surviving gunman and a sikh 
government clerk convicted in the plot were hanged in january 
pakistani prime minister benazir bhutto today congratulated her 
new indian counterpart in a message to singh released to 
reporters she said pakistan would make its full contribution 
towards strengthening peace and stability in our region 
the two nations have fought three wars since 1947 and have 
thousands of troops on their borders 
for the past two years singh led the efforts to unite the 
countrys usually disparate opposition parties into a cohesive bloc 
against gandhis congress party he is modest and vacillating an 
unlikely leader for an ideologically diverse coalition in the 
worlds most populous democracy 
singh born to a rajah became king of the manda district in 
northern india but gave away his small kingdom to members of the 
lower castes long before royal titles were outlawed in 1971 
he capitalized on a desire for change in attracting factions 
from the left and right to support his coalition and oust the 
congress party for only the second time since independence 
indias first prime minister jawaharlal nehru his daughter 
prime minister indira gandhi and her son rajiv all carried the 
congress banner to power 
the only other show of opposition unity came in 1977 when mrs 
gandhi was defeated the anticongress coalition however only 
lasted 29 months 
given the fragilility of both his formal and informal coalition 
singh may have trouble enacting any major changes 
his national front is a centrist alliance but to win a vote of 
confidence in parliament he is dependent upon the allegiance of 
farright and farleft parties 
the nov 2226 elections gave the national front has only 144 
seats in the lower house of parliament far short of the 263 
majority needed to carry a motion 
but it has pledges of support from the hindu fundamentalist 
bharatiya janata party and several communist parties combined with 
the national front singh could muster 283 votes and probably a 
few more from independents and tiny parties whose have not declared 
their allegiances 
gandhis congress party has 192 seats plus the allegiance of 17 
more legislators from regional parties 
gandhi became prime minister after his mothers assassination in 
1984 winning a fourfifths parliamentary majority his early 
promises to root out corruption started to bear fruit under a 
series of tax raids conducted by singh 
after singhs resignation swedish and indian news reports 
disclosed the swedish arms manufacturer ab bofors paid as much as 
50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a 14 billion 
weapons contract 
gandhi vigorously denied wrongdoing and the charges have never 
been proved but they raised serious questions about the gandhis 
integrity and cost him popular support

rajiv gandhis election debacle had two 
main causes one of them he could have controlled his aloofness 
from the people who five years ago overwhelmingly endorsed him as 
their leader 
the other he was powerless to fight an impatient desire for 
change in a developing nation where voters think the fastest way 
to improve things is to throw out the old leader and usher in a new 
one 
the legacy of a powerful family brought gandhi to the prime 
ministers office but it was not enough to keep him there he 
repeatedly invoked the achievements of his famous forebears his 
grandfather jawaharlal nehru and his mother indira gandhi both 
also prime ministers 
but rajiv gandhi failed to preserve the initial wave of euphoria 
that propelled him into the prime ministers job after mrs 
gandhis assassination 
for only the second time in modern indias 42 years as a free 
nation gandhi and the congress party failed to win a majority of 
seats in parliaments policymaking lower house the lok sabha 
the nov 2226 elections failed to give anyone a decisive 
mandate but one thing was clear the congress party was no longer 
the overwhelming choice of the people although it won 192 votes 
more than any other single party 
a centrist coalition called the national front formed early 
this year at the instigation of onetime gandhi ally vishwanath 
pratap singh captured 144 seats in the new parliament 
singh managed to galvanize other opposition parties ranging 
from communists to hindu fundamentalists into an unwieldy but 
for the moment at least effective alliance together this motley 
crew commands 283 of the 525 seats the lok sabha or house of the 
people 
on saturday president ramaswamy venkataraman installed singh as 
prime minister 
almost until the very end the gap between the congress party 
and the people was so great that gandhi and his closest aides were 
unable to grasp the fact they were losing 
they woke up very late they didnt know that a campaign was 
going against them since 1987 they were hopelessly out of touch 
said vinod dua a political commentator who served as cohost of 
staterun televisions election coverage and analysis 
even as i was on tv seeing the results their spokesmen were 
saying they were going to win dua said 
singh who served as gandhis finance and defense minister 
before his tax raids and anticorruption investigations struck too 
close to home in congress park ranks resigned from the cabinet in 
the spring of 1987 a few months later he was expelled from the 
congress for antiparty activities 
gandhi meanwhile failed to recognize the mounting groundswell 
against him remaining confident voters would never again trust 
opposition politicians who were elected to power only once before 
for 29 months in 197779 
gandhis mother was ousted at that time but swept back to power 
in 1980 after the intervening government started bickering and fell 
apart 
ashis nandy a psychologist who switched to political science 
and is now an analyst at new delhis center for the study of 
developing societies said gandhi also failed to meet the rising 
aspirations of a third world country of 880 million people most of 
whom have yet to cast off the shackles of poverty disease and 
illiteracy 
this is a society where the middle classes have emerged as a 
great voter bank nandy said estimating their numbers at 200 
million to 250 million but this is still a minority its 
absolutely stupid the contempt for the other indians that this 
middle class shows 
and the middle class the people who read newspapers have 
money to spend are politically aware also began to tire of their 
government he said 
two years ago nandy predicted that india was headed for a 
series of oneterm leaders as a restless electorate looked for a 
changes in its life that did not come as fast as desired 
had there not been a mr singh the indian middle classes 
would have invented him nandy wrote in an article published by 
the indian express in august 1987 the moral of the story is 
this after riding through the first half of its term in style a 
regime in india today tends to lose credibility dramatically 
irrespective of the quality or nature of the leadership 
in an interview last week nandy noted that when gandhi came to 
power in 1984 he promised to root out the corruption endemic in 
india but after 2 years the corruption was still there so was 
the unwieldy bureaucracy the labrythine court system the 
illiteracy rate of 64 percent 
gandhi in taking credit for changes he had made such as 
loosening up the economy for investment and easing strained 
relations with pakistan also took the fall for things that had 
gone wrong or had not improved 
at the same time gandhi turned his back on the bosses in the 
party whose ticket had brought him to power his confidantes and 
aides included personal friends with no experience in politics 
he reshuffled his cabinet at least 20 times in five years never 
quite attaining a workable combination 
one of his closest aides who ended up managing the fraud and 
violencemarred election campaign in gandhis own constituency was 
a fellow pilot from the prime ministers days at indian airlines 
his speech writer was a man of biting wit who sometimes peppered 
the prime ministers addresses with barbs aimed at the very people 
he was supposed to be honoring 
his official spokesman was aloof and often unavailable to the 
reporters who covered gandhis daily activities 
and there were few places in the country where the 
cambridgeeducated gandhi and his italian wife sonia seemed to 
belong certainly not in his own dirtpoor constituency of amethi 
no matter how many electricity poles and blacktopped roads he 
pumped into it 
fluent and confident in english he sounded squeaky even 
hesitant in hindi mispronouncing words and throwing in english 
phrases he was outclassed at his campaign rallies by local orators 
who warmed up the crowds and tried to keep them from leaving before 
the prime minister arrived sometimes hours behind schedule 
the nehrugandhi dynasty brought rajiv to power but it didnt 
keep him there his mother suffered the same lesson in 1977 but 
she managed to rebound in less than three years and hold on until 
her assassination in 1984 
some doubt whether her son has the same stamina even if his 
nemesis singh falters

romanian leader nicolae ceausescu leveled 
unusual criticism at his ruling communist party and called for a 
program to modernize the food industry and improve consumer 
distribution the staterun agerpres news agency said saturday 
in recent weeks ceausescu has shown an increasing interest in 
improving the supply of food to the population in what observers 
speculate could be an attempt to appease the population and avert 
the reform demands sweeping the rest of eastern europe 
ceausescu made his remarks friday at the first meeting of the 
politburo since he was unanimously reelected party leader last 
week at a party congress at that congress ceausescu reaffirmed 
his opposition to reform 
ceausescu who rigidly controls government and party affairs in 
romania admitted at fridays meeting that a number of problems 
emerged in the area of trade and proper supplies to the 
population agerpres reported 
under ceausescus centralized command economy romania once the 
breadbasket of eastern europe rations basic food staples such as 
meat white flour cooking oil and bread fresh vegetables and 
fruit are scarce even in spring and summer 
ceausescu said a special program was required to modernize the 
food and light industries better organize the shopping network and 
to meet the comsumer demands agerpres reported adding that 
ceausescu said the shortages would be remedied within two years 
leveling unusual criticism at his party and its work ceausescu 
said the politburo and the central committee must be improved 
he said it was essential to strengthen the sense of 
responsibility order and discipline for the firm application of 
the laws and the party decisions agerpres reported 
ceausescu called on the party leadership to improve 
communication with local party leaders and not take any decision 
that has not been discussed with the whole party 
although ceausescu was unanimously reelected party leader 
there have been signs of dissatisfaction within the party 
romania is a oneparty state with no parliamentary opposition 
and all key government posts are held by communists 
the politburo also criticized economic shortcomings including 
factories operating at a loss and failures to meet export quotas 
at the politburo meeting ceausescu assumed the mandate of 
organizing an international conference of communist parties as 
soon as possible 
ceausescu had proposed such a conference during the party 
congress leading to speculation the hardline leader could be 
seeking outside support in the face of the reform movements 
elsewhere in eastern europe including poland hungary east 
germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia

the house government operations committee 
urged the bush administration saturday to clear the way for use of 
federal funds for research into the infertility problem plaguing 
millions of american couples 
government unwillingness to fund research has slowed the search 
for ways to improve in vitro fertilization and other hightech 
solutions to infertility according to the report issued saturday 
in vitro fertilization in which an egg is fertilized in a 
laboratory dish and then implanted in the womb has changed from 
a rarely used technique to an established medical procedure over 
the last decade the report said but it added that only 6 
percent of initial in vitro fertilization procedures result in the 
birth of a baby 
about 24 million american couples cannot have children because 
of infertility problems the report said 
right to life groups have opposed infertility research because 
it involves studying fertilized eggs 
five republicans on the 39member committee disagreed with the 
reports recommendation saying the issue goes beyond religion 
they said hundreds of infertility clinics have been 
established across the united states as part of a billiondollar 
industry serving people in need given the strong private sector 
involvement in fighting infertility perhaps this is not the best 
use of scarce tax dollars 
the decision in any case should be made by congress and not 
the administration they said 
for a decade government funding for in vitro fertilization 
research has been caught in a bureaucratic tangle involving an 
ethics advisory board that first gave its approval then went out 
of business and has never been reconstituted 
the report recommended that research on in vitro fertilization 
be exempt from review by the board and instead be subject to 
approval by the director of the national institutes of health it 
also recommended that the board be reconstituted to pass judgment 
on other controversial research 
the report said that as a result of the lack of effective 
treatment for infertility many couples who cannot conceive are 
exploited by health care professionals who claim to be 
specialists in the field but yield few successful pregnancies 
a 1988 report by the office of technology assessment said that 
more than half of the 169 in vitro fertility clinics in existence 
at that time had not produced a live birth but patients were not 
told of their lack of success 
patients pay an average of 9376 for two in vitro fertilization 
attempts the report said additionally because this is a method 
of last resort these patients have already spent an average 
13000 on previous infertility treatments it said 
most in vitro clinics have waiting lists of patients some as 
long as one to two years the report said 
the report also recommended an increase in federal funding to 
prevent sexually transmitted diseases that cause infertility the 
centers for disease control estimates that 125000 cases of 
infertility related to sexually transmitted diseases occur every 
year cdc also estimates that about half of these women want to 
have children 
the report is based on an investigation by the human resources 
and intergovernmental relations subcommittee which is chaired by 
rep ted weiss dny and was issued by the house government 
operations committee

israelibacked militia gunners shelled 
the southern market town of nabatiyeh on saturday killing three 
shiite moslem people and wounding nine police reported 
a police spokesman said the casualties occurred during a 
threehour barrage by gunners of the israeliallied south lebanon 
army militia in the crowded market town which has a population of 
about 100000 
the spokesman who cannot be named in line with regulations 
said the attack started after fighters of the mainstream shiite 
amal militia ambushed an sla squad on a road east of nabatiyeh 
sla casualties could not be determined but judging by the 
retaliatory artillery barrage it seems theyve had some 
fatalities the spokesman said 
the 2500strong sla backed by israeli troops patrols a narrow 
strip of south lebanon referred to by the jewish state as the 
security zone 
israel carved out the 328squaremile zone when it withdrew the 
bulk of its invading army from south lebanon in the summer of 1985 
ending a threeyear occupation of the region 
the zone serves as a buffer against crossborder guerrilla 
infiltrations into northern israel

the almost 1 billion american aid program for 
poland and hungary is spawning a whole new industry as government 
officials and private analysts assess opportunities in the eastern 
bloc 
its really exciting said jim flanigan a spokesman for the 
peace corps which is preparing to send its first volunteers to 
europe in 20 years 
perhaps 65 people mainly english teachers will go to hungary 
next summer and poland is expected to get volunteers as well 
the peace corps is one of many agencies with a stake in the 
support for east european democracy act passed by congress and 
signed last week by president bush the package provides 938 
million in benefits over three years with poland receiving the 
lions share 
the agriculture department will provide food aid and the 
treasury department has 200 million earmarked for economic 
stabilization 
the exportimport bank will extend credit to exporters the 
agency for international development will set up a scholarship 
program and the energy department will help retrofit a commercial 
powerplant in krakow the environmental protection agency will work 
to improve water quality in that city and the labor department will 
help poles establish job training programs 
perhaps the most novel parts of the aid program are the 
enterprise funds one for poland and another for hungary 
the nonprofit funds to be run by private citizens will make 
loans grants and guarantees to small businesses and agricultural 
units polands fund gets 45 million next year hungarys 5 
million 
with the iron curtain in shreds businessmen consultants 
bankers and academics are hustling to learn more about what the 
future holds 
weve had lots of calls lots of interest said myra leonard 
of the polish american congress a group that represents more than 
8 million americans of polish descent she said callers included 
wouldbe investors and consultants with an eye to conducting 
management seminars 
one of americas bestknown polishamericans former national 
security advisor zbigniew brzezinski has been bombarded by callers 
seeking his views according to his secretary 
so eager are people to bone up on the situation that a seminar 
at the conservative heritage foundation a think tank on what 
are us interests behind the crumbling iron curtain attracted a 
standingroom only crowd 
the next day former defense secretary frank carlucci chaired a 
panel discussion on business opportunities in eastern european at a 
conference put on by the american foreign service association 
at the agency for international development the lead agency for 
assistance officials are still working on details of how to 
operate the first aid program in european countries with state 
economies 
were still getting ourselves organized said one aid 
official 
the course to be followed by the united states will be 
determined in part by the recommendations of a presidential 
delegation that returns to the united states after spending five 
days in poland this weekend 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter headed the delegation 
which included commerce secretary robert mosbacher labor secretary 
elizabeth dole and aflcio chief lane kirkland 
while us government aid is important gregory flynn an expert 
of eastern european affairs at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace said government money is not going to be a 
major force in redevelopment 
more important he said will be the willingness of businessmen 
to make longterm investments 
moreover he said the europeans particularly the germans and 
the italians have an edge in doing business in the eastern bloc 
countries because they have experiences and contacts in the area

two moslem girls whose insistence on 
wearing islamic scarves to school kicked off a national debate 
announced saturday that they would take off the controversial 
headgear in class 
the 13 and 14yearold sisters fatima and leila achaboun said 
they would bow to the request by their principal at gabrielhavez 
college in the northern paris suburb of creil and take off their 
hijabs 
they gave no explanation of their decision to lower the hijabs 
to their shoulders while in the classroom a third student in 
creil 15yearold samira saidani continues to refuse to abide by 
the schools request 
wearing the hijab which covers the hair ears and neck has 
stirred debate over the separation of church and state in france 
the principle of secularity in public schools has been the law 
in france since the roman catholic church was officially separated 
from the state in 1905 
the controversy began in creil when the school principal ernest 
chenieres applied the 1937 law prohibiting all religious symbols 
in school and denied the three girls the right to attend class 
until they removed the scarves the girls refused 
similar cases arose in other french cities and the arguments 
became linked to the issue of immigration particularly attitudes 
toward immigrants from moslem countries in north africa 
on monday the council of state ruled that the girls could wear 
the religous headgear if it did not cause disruptions the ruling 
by the council frances highest administrative authority left the 
decision up to school authorities to judge on a casebycase basis

sometime in the future when yetunborn 
statisticians open a time capsule in alexandria va they will 
confront a slick wooden rulerlike stick coated with tiny numbers 
and lines 
it is a slide rule as anyone who had not made it to high school 
physics or chemistry by say the mid1960s might not know 
a slide rule says the encyclopedia americana is a mechanical 
device for making rapid mathematical calculations accurate to 
several significant figures 
to the american statistical association marking its 150th 
anniversary the slide rule was the perfect mathematical relic to 
symbolize the past a fancy solar calculator was encapsuled to 
represent the present and a computer chip to stand for the future 
the slide rule invented in the 1620s or 1630s by an english 
mathematician was nearly universally replaced by the calculator 
around 20 years ago has society lost something in the transition 
no says william eddy professor of statistics at 
pittsburghs carnegiemellon university slide rules are 
inherently slower and more painful to use theyre less accurate 
too because theyre analog as opposed to digital of all the 
things in the capsule it is the least statistical 
eddy was a member of the committee that chose what went into the 
time capsule which was implanted in a column in the asas 
headquarters last week in alexandria a washington suburb the 
capsule is to be opened in 50 years or a century that decision to 
be left to the statisticians of the future 
the 15000member organization believes itself to be the 
countrys oldest national professional association its members 
have included nurse florence nightingale telephone inventor 
alexander graham bell steelmaker andrew carnegie and american 
president martin van buren 
the committee conferred by mail and phone and spent a day last 
august in deliberations to select the one cubic foot of objects 
that went into the time capsule 
also encapsuled the transcript of a speech by former sen 
william proxmire dwis to the asas meeting last summer a 
15minute videotape on what is statistics the front section 
of last mondays new york times a copy of an 1875 letter from ms 
nightingale together with an annual sanitation report from 
india that she sent along a yellow and a blue asa tshirt and 
to prove statisticians have a sense of humor says eddy a 
batman button 
a few lottery tickets were thrown in too 
lotteries hold a great fascination for statisticians eddy 
said because they cant figure out why people play them given 
the odds

president bush and mikhail s 
gorbachev began a stormtossed summit today with five hours of 
talks and the white house said afterward the two men worked in a 
spirit of forwardlooking cooperation 
the president and his soviet counterpart recognized that 
economic and political challenges were ahead for eastern europe 
and vowed to consider the opportunities presented with sensitivity 
and firm initiative said the statement issued by white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater 
high winds and rough seas forced the two men to scrap plans to 
talk aboard a soviet naval vessel anchored offshore opting 
instead for a session on a docked soviet cruise liner that served 
as gorbachevs headquarters for the twoday summit 
bush returned to his headquarters on the uss belknap following 
the initial sessions the white house said an afternoon round of 
talks were put on hold because of the bad weather which kept bush 
from immediately leaving the belknap 
the white house said they talked almost continuously for 
nearly five hours including a session with aides and a session 
with only notetakers and then continued their talks over lunch 
president bush spoke for more than an hour to open the 
meeting laying out more than a dozen ideas for economic and 
political progress in ussoviet relations the statement said 
the discussion ranged from the economic situation in eastern 
europe to arms control and central america chairman gorbachev 
spoke at length of perestroika and the goals of his reform 
program it said 
the two men also arranged to have an afternoon of talks before 
getting together for dinner the summit concludes on sunday 
the white house said the opening talks included a very 
productive informal and substantive meeting 
the meetings were sparked by a spirit of forwardlooking 
cooperation during these increasingly changing times it said 
the white house said the discussion ranged from the economic 
situation in eastern europe to arms control and central america 
chairman gorbachev spoke at length of perestroika and the goals 
of his reform program it said 
the president emphasized his support for the success of 
perestroika he set forth his ideas as a broad framework for 
actions that would help the two nations work together for peace and 
prosperity it said 
the two leaders both in an affable mood met aboard the 
25000ton maxim gorky which is gorbachevs headquarters for the 
weekend summit to begin nearly 12 hours of scheduled talks that 
could bring down the curtain on the cold war 
i think weve got a very good beginning of the dialogue an 
excellent beginning secretary of state james a baker iii told 
reporters after bush and gorbachev completed their initial 
threehour session 
senior soviet officials said gorbachev wants the summit to 
produce a timetable for completing ussoviet treaties on reducing 
strategic nuclear weapons conventional forces in central europe 
and chemical weapons 
these officials who spoke only on condition they not be 
identified said gorbachev will convene a meeting of warsaw pact 
leaders in moscow on monday to discuss the results of the twoday 
summit bush will spend monday briefing allied leaders at nato 
headquarters in brussels belgium 
gorbachev and bush were smiling and in high spirits as they 
clasped hands across a long rectangular table measuring barely a 
yard across 
its so narrow that if we dont have enough arguments well 
kick each other gorbachev told bush 
asked by reporters if they would reach any agreements gorbachev 
replied da da yes yes agreement on what he was asked 
mnogovo which was translated as meaning a lot of things 
when bush was asked the same question the president echoed 
gorbachev mnogovo he said 
the two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a librarylike 
room known as the card room next to the ships lounge and 
nightclub on the maxim gorkys promenade deck 
they sat in deep captains chairs accompanied by aides on 
either side 
arms control eastwest trade and the breathtaking democratic 
reforms sweeping communist eastern europe dominated the agenda for 
the bushgorbachev talks both leaders said they hoped their 
discussions would strengthen longterm prospects for world peace 
and european unity 
gorbachev asked if he would discuss fastmoving political 
changes in east europe replied well be discussing everything 
including that 
the senior soviet sources said gorbachev wants a stategic arms 
reduction treaty ready for signing at his next planned summit 
meeting with bush in washington next spring or early summer 
they said the soviet leader also is seeking a bush commitment to 
attend a 35nation summit at the end of 1990 to sign a separate 
accord sharply reducing us and soviet troops in central europe 
the original site for the first summit session was the soviet 
guided missile cruiser slava anchored near the belknap in this 
harbor but white house officials said the meeting was shifted to 
the maxim gorky because galeforce winds would have made launch 
transfers treacherous 
the white house said there was no danger to anyone aboard 
belknap as a result of the high winds 
the 630foot maxim gorky is about twice as large as the slava in 
total tonnage built 20 years ago in west germany it was sold to 
the soviet union in 1974 and is used frequently for cruises through 
the north sea and scandanavian waters the vessel was repaired 
after it rammed an iceberg off norway last june with 900 people 
aboard but there were no injuries 
the two leaders are scheduled to meet sunday aboard the belknap 
flagship of the us sixth fleet which is anchored about 400 yards 
from the slava

fourteenyearold mamta who lost her 
parents and five brothers and sisters in the deadly gas leak at 
union carbides pesticide plant here tried to commit suicide two 
weeks ago by setting fire to her house 
she was rescued by neighbors and sent to an orphanage in another 
town 
many of the more than 20000 survivors of the worlds worst 
industrial accident share mamtas despair and five years later 
they still have not been compensated 
they have trouble finding work because their eyes and lungs were 
damaged by exposure to the white cloud of methyl isocyanate that 
passed over their crowded shantytowns on dec 3 1984 
instead they wait for their shares of the 470 million the 
usbased multinational union carbide gave the indian government 
in full and final compensation of the disaster that has killed 
at least 3598 people 
the government alleged the leak was the result of negligence by 
union carbide and sued it for 3 billion union carbide said the 
leak was sabotage by a disgruntled employee 
indias supreme court ultimately approved union carbides 470 
million compensation but many survivors bitterly contest the 
settlement as much too small 
the governments right to agree to the settlement as the sole 
representative of the survivors has been challenged delaying 
disbursement of most of the money 
meanwhile the deaths continue at least 269 people have died in 
the past year of ailments blamed on exposure to the gas sr 
satyam the madhya pradesh state governments commissioner for gas 
relief says 1960 deaths await investigation 
the government still has not reviewed all of the approximately 
570000 compensation claims 
some of the seekers were hundreds of miles from bhopal at the 
time of the leak but say they suffered mental anguish worrying 
about the fates of loved ones 
a survey by a team of doctors found that 70 percent of the 
people who inhaled the gas still suffer from severe respiratory 
disorders chronic eye diseases cataracts menstrual problems and 
neurological disorders 
the governments figures of the permanantly disabled are 
grossly underestimated the teams spokesman dr nishith 
vohra told reporters friday in new delhi 
dr gurbaksh rai dheer bhopals chief medical officer said 
there is no known treatment for the gas our treatment is 
symptomatic this has helped some of the victims to recover but 
many are showing no signs of improvement he said 
he said psychological disorders resulting from trauma are also 
common 
satyam cites mamta who tried to burn herself to death by 
setting fire to the family home 
her brother sunil vishwakarma 17 now sits brooding with his 
dog moti in the tinroofed house across the road from the closed 
union carbide plant 
the indian government has spent millions of rupees on relief and 
rehabilitation but survivors say the measures are inadequate 
the government began with dole of money grains and milk 
said shankarlal shrivastava a grocer but now all assistance has 
stopped he said 
we cannot exert ourselves because of breathing problems and 
it is difficult to find a job suited to our physical capability 
he said 
activist groups call the 470 million settlement grossly 
inadequate and organized demonstrations for more compensation 
after it was announced 
protests have become rare it is becoming increasingly clear 
that the amount will not be raised any further said alok pratap 
singh who heads the poisonous gas episode struggle front 
satinath sarangi of the bhopal group for information and action 
said the low compensation was offered because multinational 
companies feel life in the third world is cheap 
all we want now is that the charges of homicide against the 
company should not be dropped and its officials should be 
prosecuted he said 
how can we allow this killer company to be exonerated from the 
charge of killing our family members and making our lives 
miserable said razia bee 40 whose husband and two daughters 
died in the gas leak 
i just feel like dropping a bomb on the factory but i fear 
there are still poisonous gases inside she said 
narmada bai rajoria another widow said the victims want jobs 
not alms she said she returned an early stopgap award of 625 
which was given by the government as compensation for her husbands 
death 
i want employment so that i can support my family and live 
with dignity mrs rajoria said

bush and gorbachev met this morning on the 25000ton liner 
maxim gorky after galeforce winds caused both the soviet ship 
slava the original site of todays meeting and the uss belknap to 
drag their anchors 
bush returned to belknap after five hours of talks and was to 
return to the gorky for an afternoon summit session but the white 
house said the weather forced a delay in that second session 
this morning the white house issued a statement saying that the 
winds which built overnight make it difficult to disembark from 
launches at the slava and the belknap therefore this mornings 
meeting has been shifted to the soviet ship gorky at anchor at 
malta 
maltese meteorologist spiro agius said the winds should abate by 
sunday the final day of the summit it will definitely be 
improving tomorrow he said 
despite a little pitching from the heavy seas the winds did not 
present a danger to anyone on the belknap bushs headquarters for 
the summit and the site of his wrapup meeting on sunday with 
gorbachev the white house statement said 
in fact bush who slept aboard the belknap friday night said 
on the gorky that he was feeling pretty good asked how he 
slept he said fine just finepiece of cake 
the stormy conditions prompted raisa gorbachev to delay a 
sightseeing tour but she later went ahead with the visit 
including an inspection of a 16thcentury cathedral 
this is the type of weather that shipwrecked saint paul on 
these rocks we usually have this in february joe cassar 
maltese minister for housing told a rainsoaked crowd that had 
gathered to see the soviet leaders wife at santa lucia a suburb 
of valletta the capital city 
both the 12500ton slava and 8600ton belknap are anchored in 
the middle of the bay while the much larger gorky which has been 
gorbachevs base during his time in malta is tied up at a pier 
the high winds were blowing from the northeast marsaxlokk bay 
a large indentation in the southeast coast of malta is exposed to 
winds from easterly directions 
the hasty change in plans for the superpower meeting in the 
mediterranean came as the tiny windwhipped island nation was as 
ready as it would ever be for its weekend in the international 
limelight 
malta was hoping the summit would boost attention for the 
island but the bad weather probably was not the type of publicity 
the maltese had in mind 
on shore red soviet flags flapped in the stiff breeze 
on friday street salesmen were out in force to hawk 
commemorative tshirts and other souvenir and residents strolled to 
the edge of marsaxlokk bay for a look at the two anchored warships 
this may help your tourism bush had told prime minister 
edward fenechadami on friday following his arrival from washington 
it will probably bring positive economic effects said a 
21yearold woman who identified herself only as dorothy assessing 
the summits meaning for the 350000 maltese 
she and two companions had come out friday night for a glimpse 
of the warships we were bored she admitted 
on the other side of the bay in the fishing village of 
birzebuga albert roberts led a group of labor party workers 
preparing for a peace demonstration timed to coincide with the 
summit decorating a float that will be a part of a 60piece parade 
on saturday 
give peace a chance said signs on the float in both english 
and russian 
although bush and gorbachev were unlikely to see the parade 
itself roberts said malta is ready to show to the world that we 
hope for peace 
traffic circles and seaside roads were decorated with soviet and 
us flags and maltese security forces stood through the night in 
clumps of two or three on streets overlooking the harbor 
maltas entire 1200man military and most of its 1000 police 
officers have been assigned to the summit security job roadblocks 
and checkpoints made it hard to get around on the narrow island 
roads although it seemed anyone with a good story could get waved 
through 
although thousands of maltese had skipped work or classes to 
catch a glimpse of bushs arrival early friday most were already 
in bed by the time gorbachevs il62 rolled up to the airport 
gangway at 11 pm sharp during a gentle mist 
the prime minister and his cabinet broke from their line and 
walked over to the planes gangplank as sgt emmanuel gatt a 
32veteran of the maltese army and two other soldiers rolled out a 
red carpet for gorbachev and his wife raisa who walked arminarm 
down the steps 
after a 21gun salute a maltese armed forces band in dark blue 
uniforms with red piping on their pants played the soviet and 
maltese national anthems 
gorbachev thanked malta for preparing the summit for him and 
president bush 
although we will be meeting on naval ships i would like to 
assure you that we will be speaking about peace about how we can 
work for a better world he said

chin peng one of the worlds 
longestsurviving and most secretive communist guerrilla leaders 
laid down his arms saturday after a halfcentury of jungle warfare 
and the insurgency he started with the killing of three british 
rubber planters 41 years ago in what is now malaysia has formally 
ended in a southern thailand city known more for its sex trade than 
politics 
now in his late 60s chin peng signed an agreement ending the 
armed struggle of the communist party of malaya which has within 
its muchwithered ranks some 1200 weary jungle fighters who are to 
return to civilian life 
the communists agreed to lay down their arms and pledged loyalty 
to king and country thailand and malaysia promised to ensure their 
fair treatment 
the signing ceremony at hat yai a bustling center attracting 
thousands of tourists and smuggled goods from nearby malaysia 
marked another failure of communist effort around the world 
chin peng called the agreements consistent with the current 
historical trend where the peoples of the whole world are striving 
for peace and democracy 
chin pengs future appears uncertain some malaysian officials 
have expressed suspicion of his motives and the country appears 
unwilling to accept exguerrillas once officially known as cts or 
communist terrorists who sought power through the barrel of a gun 
dubbed the worlds senior surviving guerrilla by one western 
expert chin peng belongs to a now all but vanished breed who 
fought to create a marxistleninist order following the chaos of 
world war ii 
in world war ii the young chin peng was a courageous 
behindenemylines fighter against the japanese learning guerrilla 
tactics from his british comradesatarms in the jungles of malaya 
formerly a british colony and now a part of malaysia he also 
became a committed communist 
unusual ability an incisive brain reliable a frank man 
who possessed marked courage and commanded the natural respect 
of men without fuss or formality one of the british officers 
john davis said of him 
he was awarded the order of the british empire after the war 
soon however he became secretarygeneral of the communist party 
he was born in 1920 or 1922 in malayas perak state of chinese 
parents who immigrated to malaya shortly before his birth his 
father made a good living selling and repairing bicycles and sent 
his son to local english schools where he excelled 
the chinese were in many respects an underprivileged class in 
britishruled malaya and for a number of young people among them 
communism represented social justice and a shortcut to power and 
status 
in 1948 the party decided to wage armed struggle the opening 
volleys of which were fired june 16 when guerrillas walked into two 
rubber plantations in northern malaya and methodically executed 
three planters 
the country was plunged into 12 years of violence known as the 
malayan emergency it became one of the few successful efforts by a 
government to stamp out a communist insurgency within its borders 
later in the vietnam war the us government sought advice from 
some of the architects of the victory but conditions were far 
different in americas war 
at the height of the emergency some 70000 british australian 
new zealand fijian gurkha and other british commonwealth troops 
fought about 10000 guerrillas more than 10000 fighters and 
civilians died between 1948 and 1960 
although the casualties were relatively light the jungle 
fighting was agonizing and the communist attacks vicious tens of 
thousands of often innocent chinese were uprooted as a result of 
the ultimately successful strategy to separate the guerrillas from 
all sources of support 
clearly losing chin peng emerged from the jungle in 1955 to 
negotiate with malayan officials at a schoolhouse near the 
thaimalay border 
tunku abdul rahman shortly to become prime minister of an 
independent malaysia insisted on surrender and an amnesty but 
chin peng wanted his party included in a coalition government and 
the talks broke down 
the amnesty means surrender surrender means humiliation we 
will not accept surrender at any time chin peng said if you 
demand our surrender we would prefer to fight to the last man 
davis his wartime friend was present and the two men shook 
hands before chin peng disappeared into the jungle it was the last 
time he was seen by the noncommunist world until his recent 
emergence in thailand which brokered the agreement 
although the emergency was declared over in 1960 communist 
attacks continued their last major raids were in the mid1970s 
when guerrillas blew up the national war memorial in kuala lumpur 
thereafter communist strength was sapped through joint 
thaimalaysian military operations and a thai amnesty that saw mass 
surrenders in recent years 
chin peng reportedly spent most of his time in china making 
periodic trips to the rugged thaimalaysian border where the 
malayan communists were largely concentrated there also were 
reports of his death 
chin peng became a legendary figure the ruthlessness of his 
movement mingling with the personal respect he had elicited from 
his enemies 
cc too the onetime malaysian psychological warfare chief who 
matched wits with him described chin peng in a 1976 interview as 
having a scholarly monastic quality when he talked and acted 
it was with dignity 
if there is a communist who can be called gentlemanly it was 
chin peng he said

a fledgling faction of the democratic party is 
organizing under the title new democrats with plans to promote 
liberal candidates in coming elections 
the group claims the support of former presidential candidates 
eugene mccarthy and gary hart in its selfdeclared mission of 
wresting control of the party from political managers 
technocrats and media consultants 
mccarthy whose early success in the 1968 democratic primaries 
led president lyndon b johnson to abandon his reelection bid has 
accepted the position of director of the new democrats steering 
committee 
he said he hopes the group can help counter the notion that 
wearing a liberal tag is a political liability 
democrats not the republicans must shoulder the blame for 
liberalisms evolution into the dreaded l word of the last 
presidential campaign the former minnesota senator said in an 
interview 
gradually the word began to take on the characteristic of a 
noun at that point it was subject to all kinds of attacks by the 
conservatives mccarthy said 
but then in the 80s liberals began to attack liberalism and 
admit that it had these serious faults i think new york mayor ed 
koch said he was a sane liberal the implication being that all 
other liberals were insane 
hart a former colorado senator and frontrunner in the 1988 
presidential campaign until a furor over his private life sabotaged 
his standing has given his blessing to the movement but declined a 
leadership position the new democrats say 
the groups founder jesse yoder is a philosophy professor at 
the university of lowell in massachusetts who worked in mccarthys 
1968 campaign he said the group plans to field its first 
candidates for political office in 1990 including congressional 
races 
philadelphiaarea political activist and sports handicapper 
darcy richardson said he intends in january to become the first 
congressional candidate to run as a new democrat 
i think the new democrats label will draw some attention 
itll make people look twice and at least give us a hearing said 
richardson who has his eye set on pennsylvanias 13th 
congressional district seat currently held by republican lawrence 
coughlin 
the new democrats will try to unite the woodstock generation 
with the younger one politically weaned on reaganomics yoder said 
the groups positions include rolling back tax breaks for the 
wealthy immediate reductions in automotive and industrial 
pollution levels and higher pay for teachers 
people who were around in 68 are now the decision makers 
today and i think those are the people we will appeal to but of 
course well also be appealing to new people the students and 
others within the party who see the merit of emphasizing the 
envirnment the economy and education yoder said 
james thurber director of the center for congressional and 
presidential studies at american university is among the skeptics 
who say the new group is unlikely to ever put a democrat in the 
white house 
any faction trying to rescue the democratic party should be 
appealing to southern conservatives such as sens charles robb of 
virginia and sam nunn of georgia not liberals he said 
they will not be able to pull from the south if you cannot 
pull from the south you lose the election thurber said

washington attorney robert s bennett who has 
won acquittals for many white collar defendants is known as a 
tough but fair negotiator with a quick grasp of legal issues 
the senate may have had that reputation in mind when it chose 
the 50yearold bennett to look into the case of five senators 
under fire for their role in the 2 billion lincoln savings and 
loan controversy 
bennett whose office overlooks pennsylvania avenue five blocks 
from the white house was chosen by the senate select committee on 
ethics as its special counsel in the case of the socalled 
keating five 
he will provide legal advice on whether any or all of the five 
senators violated the rules when they met with banking regulators 
on behalf of wealthy campaign donor charles h keating jr in 1987 
at the time keatings lincoln savings and loan of irvine calif 
was collapsing and its failure is now expected to cost taxpayers 2 
billion 
the brother of national drug policy coordinator william bennett 
stocky animated bob bennett is described by fellow lawyers as a 
tough negotiator who can quickly grasp complex legal issues 
if i were one of the senators and had done nothing wrong i 
wouldnt worry said attorney e lawrence barcella jr but if i 
were one of the senators and had something to worry about id be 
scared to death 
bennetts role is to advise the committee on whether to launch a 
formal investigation of the five alan cranston dcalif donald 
w riegle jr dmich john glenn dohio john mccain rariz 
and dennis deconcini dariz 
keating had contributed some 13 million to the senators 
campaigns and political causes 
bennetts role could become even more powerful if the panel 
proceeds with a fullscale investigation and invites him to remain 
for bennett that would not be a firsttime experience he was 
the panels counsel in the abscam bribery case against former sen 
harrison a williams jr dnj williams resigned in 1982 
in his report bennett said the senators behavior was 
illegal corrupt and unethical 
william bennett four years younger than his brother said 
when bob got you in a headlock that was it you didnt get out 
the thing is concentration his brain is like a radar screen when 
bob sizes up the topic nothing interferes 
the presidents drug coordinator recalls that he once was 
roughed up by a neighborhood bully when he was about five 
bob went to the kids house and when the mother answered the 
door he was very polite william bennett said but when the 
boy came to the door bob said this is for hitting my brother he 
decked him in the doorway thats classic bob 
bennetts whose 55member law firm has one of the nations 
largest law practices representing white collar defendants 
current and former clients include former navy secretary john f 
lehman jr four defense contractors in the pentagon bribery 
scandal known as operation ill wind and the boeing co 
joseph e digenova the former us attorney for the district of 
columbia praised bennetts appointment 
he can look at something and smell it and know when 
somethings wrong said digenova hes the kind of guy who has 
judgment he knows when enough is enough

police saturday shut down an exhibition of 
paintings by young chinese artists sponsored by foreign 
journalists saying the exhibitors failed to obtain permission from 
the government 
police also said the oneday show was activity incompatible 
with your status as journalists said jaime florcruz president 
of the foreign correspondents club of beijing 
florcruz a reporter for time magazine said three uniformed 
police officers and a plainclothes officer gave the artists 40 
minutes to remove their oil paintings from a room at the great wall 
sheraton a uschina joint venture hotel 
the correspondents club was allowed to hold a show in 1988 at 
the hotel as a way for journalists to meet young artists 
however freedom of expression for artists writers and others 
has been strictly limited since the june crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement here 
everyone is just flexing their muscles during martial law 
said meg maggio also a time staffer and the organizer of 
saturdays exhibition of 40 works by six artists 
she said police never looked at the paintings many were 
avantgarde or abstract but did not appear to carry political 
messages 
ms maggio said she was aware that under martial law in effect 
in beijing since may the club needed authorization for the 
exhibit but she said there is no procedure we didnt know how 
to get permission 
florcruz said he called the beijing cultural bureau on friday 
but was not told how to obtain the needed authorization 
he said he told police the paintings were not for sale and there 
would be no commercial activity at the exhibit the police 
responded theres no room for discussion he said 
in november the ministry of culture forced the french embassy 
to cancel a nineday exhibit of the works of a 28yearold chinese 
artist 
we were told that foreign embassies are not allowed to sponsor 
exhibitions by artists whether singers painters whatever a 
french embassy official said on condition of anonymity 
culture ministry officials told french diplomats at the time 
that the ministry planned to distribute a circular informing 
embassies of the policy several embassies said they had not 
received such a notice 
since the military marched on beijing june 34 and crushed the 
studentled prodemocracy movement writers have been told they 
must discard bourgeois liberal tendencies and produce works in 
support of socialist ideas 
film directors who had done works about the darker aspects of 
life in china have stopped directing or have returned to 
governmentsanctioned films 
most of the young artists who a year ago astonished the nation 
with the first public shows of nude and avantgarde works have gone 
underground artists can earn little or no money for their works 
domestically and those who once sought foreign buyers have been 
censured 
the official china daily on saturday criticized some art stores 
and individuals who manage artwork sales without licenses doing 
illicit trade in black markets or profiteering through underground 
channels

winds and choppy seas aboard an american naval cruiser canceled 
his second round of summit talks and a dinner saturday with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev white house officials announced 
the summit was to resume on sunday 
putting a sunny spin on a rain splattered day the white house 
said we feel this has been a very productive day in terms of the 
fivehour meeting this morning there was no immediate word from 
the soviet delegation 
bush and gorbachev had held five hours of talks earlier in the 
day before bush returned to his ship to prepare for the second 
round and the dinner which originally was supposed to have been 
aboard the presidents command ship the belknap 
bush was unable to cross 500 yards of roiling waters to reach 
gorbachev resting on a luxurious soviet cruise liner tied up at 
shore 
a white house statement making fun of the frustration said 
the 60 miles per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship

james a baker iii brent scowcroft the presidents national 
security adviser and marlin fitzwater the presidents press 
secretary 
the meeting on ships in the mediterranean had been bushs idea 
for the beginning but the white house tried to share any 
embarrassment with the soviets 
we are disappointed that the soviet delegation was unable to 
join us for dinner on belknap due to the storm the statement 
said adding that us officials look forward to sundays scheduled 
meeting 
we also regret that we were unable to visit the slava for this 
afternoons meeting it added the slava a soviet naval cruiser 
was to have been the site for saturdays meeting but the talks 
were moved to a soviet cruise liner docked at the shore 
stating the obvious the statement said that bush and his

through the upheaval of democratic leadership 
the fight with the white house over capital gains and the 
endofsession pay raise house speaker thomas s foley has been 
able to maintain his dry sense of humor 
during his last daily news conference before congress adjourned 
last month the washington democrat took note of the first live 
telecast of the proceedings of the british house of commons 
i know youre going to think they are much more witty and much 
more stimulating in every way foley an ardent admirer of 
britains parliamentary system said of his british counterparts 
what i understand from reading the paper is that british 
television consultants have been suggesting that they behave like 
us congressmen which will make it a dull place indeed over 
there if they do 
foley went on to say that the speaker of the british house of 
commons recently asked him what number speaker he was 
i said i was the 49th foley said he said he was the 
634th they generally date the speakership from 1377 
and i said well thats what we call a putdown in the united 
states mr speaker 
and he said well eight of them were beheaded two of them 
on the same day 
after six months as speaker foley also has been able to impose 
his leadership style on a house that was soured by deep partisan 
divisions that climaxed in the resignation of former speaker jim 
wright of texas 
foley has preached the doctrine of cooperation not 
confrontation and reduced the bitterness and tension by working 
closely with republican leaders to create an atmosphere in which 
policy differences rather than personal or partisan differences 
dominate the debate 
as the first session of the 101st congress ground to a close 
house minority leader bob michel of illinois introduced a 
resolution thanking foley for the able impartial and dignified 
manner in which he had run the house 
part of the achievement has been getting the focus of congress 
back on the legislative agenda foley said in an interview i 
dont accept the notion that democrats should be confrontational 
and resist everything the administration does 
despite lingering grumblings from some democrats that foley 
needs to be more combative the speaker said he has no intention of 
changing his approach 
i am not a basher foley said just to be an opponent of 
the president every day of the week because im a democrat and hes 
a republican is not what i think the public had in mind that 
doesnt mean we will be a greek chorus of background for the 
administration 
foley gave the first session of congress a grade of b pointing 
with pride to legislation bailing out the savings and loan 
industry raising the minimum wage increasing funding for the war 
on drugs and overhauling existing oil spill liability laws 
foley also defended the pay increase which was coupled with 
what he called the most important ethics reforms since 1977 
i dont fool myself that this is always the most popular 
legislation with the public foley said of the pay raise 
foley said he was disappointed there was no final action on 
child care legislation and that both congress and the 
administration wasted time and energy on an illtimed 
illconceived proposal to cut capital gains taxes 
he said that how the united states reacts to the easing of 
tensions with the eastern bloc and carve up the peace dividend 
if the defense budget is cut will be top priority issues for 
congress next year 
but he said it was premature to talk about deep cuts in the 
defense budget 
the speaker said he too was caught off guard by the rapid pace 
of the developments in eastern europe and it is hard to 
contemplate where it will lead it is premature to say the cold 
war is over 
foley did not rule out the possibility of the united states 
committing money and resources to furthering the opening of 
eastern europe and suggested that congress may have to approve 
credits for food and fuel to prop up the soviet economy through 
the winter

president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev meeting at a stormcurtailed summit 
discussed the political upheaval in in eastern europe on saturday 
and vowed to respond to events with with sensitivity and firm 
initiative us officials said 
after five hours of talks that began with handshakes and smiles 
between the two leaders a white house statement said the meetings 
were marked by a spirit of forwardlooking cooperation during 
these increasingly changing times 
but galeforce winds and roiling seas forced cancellation of 
afternoon talks and a scheduled dinner bush was unable to leave 
the uss belknap and cross 500 yards of meditereanean sea to reach 
gorbachev resting on a luxurious soviet cruise liner tied up at 
shore 
both sides said the reason for the change in schedule was the 
weather 
referring to the talks held before weather intervened gennady 
gerasimov gorbachevs spokesman said things went well they 
talked about everything arms europe philosphical questions 
bush opened the morning meeting with an hourlong presentation 
proposing more than a dozen ideas for economic and political 
progress in ussoviet relations the white house statement said 
without elaboration 
it said the talks ranged from the economic situation in eastern 
europe to arms control and central america and added that 
gorbachev spoke at length about perestroika his program of 
economic restructuring and the goals of his reform program 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler stressed there 
was no other reason for the change in schedule except the 
weather 
a white house statement said the 60 miles per hour winds 
preclude any movements off the ship this evening but they have 
made for a very exciting afternoon sail 
bush and gorbachev had been scheduled to wrap up their talks on 
sunday and the white house said we expect that to be the case 
the weather aside the white house assessment of the talks was 
upbeat we feel this has been a very productive day in terms of 
the five hour meeting this morning said the white house 
i think weve got a very good beginning of the dialogue an 
excellent beginning secretary of state james a baker iii told 
reporters after bush and gorbachev completed their initial session 
they recognized that economic and political challenges were 
ahead for eastern europe and voewed to consider the opportunities 
presented with sensitivity and firm initiative said the 
statement issued later 
the first thing to do is eliminate those types of ships which 
you cannot board in this kind of weather gorbachev joked to bush 
as he welcomed him aboard 
we will have a secret agenda in this way to disarm the us 
sixth fleet the soviet leader said with a laugh the soviets are 
serious however in pressing the united states to agree to 
reductions in naval forces as part of arms control negotiations and 
to remove nuclear weapons from the mediterranean zone 
as the small talk ended bush said lets go to work 
bush braved the choppy seas in a small launch to get to the 
soviet liner and then ran into trouble when he returned to his 
command ship the cruiser uss belknap also anchored about 500 
yards from land 
his launch had to make four passes at the belknap before he 
could board 
the white house sought to minimize the effect the bad weather 
was having on the summit and put an upbeat spin on the talks 
saying that bush thought the talks were extremely productive 
senior soviet officials said gorbachev wants the summit to 
produce a timetable for completing ussoviet treaties on reducing 
strategic nuclear weapons conventional forces in central europe 
and chemical weapons 
these officials who spoke only on condition they not be 
identified said gorbachev will convene a meeting of warsaw pact 
leaders in moscow on monday to discuss the results of the twoday 
summit bush will spend monday briefing allied leaders at nato 
headquarters in brussels belgium 
gorbachev and bush were smiling and in high spirits as they 
clasped hands across a long rectangular table measuring barely a 
yard across 
its so narrow that if we dont have enough arguments well 
kick each other gorbachev told bush 
asked by reporters if they would reach make any achievements 
gorbachev replied da da yes yes on what he was asked 
mnogovo which was translated as meaning a lot of things 
when bush was asked the same question the president echoed 
gorbachev mnogovo he said 
the two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a librarylike 
room known as the card room next to the ships lounge and 
nightclub on the maxim gorkys promenade deck 
they sat in deep captains chairs accompanied by aides on 
either side 
bush who had spent the night on the stormbuffeted belknap 
said he had not been bothered by the rough weather piece of 
cake he said 
bush and gorbachev held three rounds of talks that the white 
house said amounted to almost continuous discussions between 1005 
am until 3 pm 
they began with an expanded meeting that included at least 16 
people and then held a oneonone session with notetakers that 
lasted about 1 hours that was followed by a working lunch after 
which bush returned to the belknap for some private time 
the rain and wind disrupted raisa gorbachevs sightseeing plans 
she at first canceled plans to visit a 16th century cathedral 
choosing to remain aboard the gorky but then later went ahead with 
the tour first lady barbara bush did not accompany bush to the

american consumers are likely to see 
broad changes in the way they do business with their bankers and 
investment firms in the early 1990s 
that was the prospect raised friday when wall streets main 
trade group the securities industry association proposed a 
radical revamping of the 56yearold law that defines what distinct 
services banks and brokers can offer 
that law the glasssteagall act of 1933 is designed to guard 
against conflicts of interest and threats to financial stability 
by for example keeping a safe distance between bank deposits and 
risky investments like stocks 
but in recent years financial deregulation in this country and 
increasing international competition have been steadily chipping 
away at glasssteagall 
banks have entered the securities business such as by opening 
discount brokerage offices and selling mutual funds brokers have 
encroached on bankers turf by creating central assets accounts 
that are not federally insured but feature checkwriting and 
credit cards 
late friday the sia endorsed a proposal to scrap glasssteagall 
and rebuild it from the ground up this approach could result in 
new services being available at banks or investment firms and it 
conceivably could wipe out some changes consumers have grown used 
to in recent years 
the critical question is not whether there will be a 
glasssteagall in the future but what will replace it richard 
breeden the chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
said saturday 
proponents of the change stress that they want to keep federally 
insured deposits separate from investments and securities deals 
that are exposed to market risks 
but they do envision single corporate entities formed perhaps 
through mergers with separate subsidiaries overseen by separate 
regulators that would offer banking and brokerage services 
advocates of the change say american financial companies of all 
kinds need a new framework to compete with foreign financial 
institutions of increasing size and strength with a growing 
presence in this country 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said of the sia initiative 
i think thats appropriate particularly from an international 
perspective 
many interested parties are still to be heard from on the 
proposal including the federal reserve and the banking industry 
and for the proposal to become reality congress would have to take 
a new look at the issue when it reconvenes next year 
we recognize how complex these matters are and that they will 
take time to work out said robert downey a partner at the 
prominent wall street firm of goldman sachs amp co who took over 
friday as the sias chairman for the next year 
our nations banks and securities firms need to be ready to 
compete internationally but we must avoid precipitating huge new 
risks for the federal deposit insurance system 
we do not want a repeat of the 160 billion bailout of the 
thrift industry

the solar maximum satellite a scientific 
window to the earth the sun and even distant stars for nearly 10 
years plunged to its fiery destruction saturday in the atmosphere 
over the indian ocean 
capt thomas niemann of the us space command in colorado 
springs colo said the satellite reentered the earths 
protective atmosphere at about 526 am est and broke up in what 
likely was a 500milelong path of burning debris over the indian 
ocean roughly halfway between the coasts of india and australia 
niemann said there were no reported sightings of the plunge of 
solar max which occurred during afternoon hours in that part of 
the world a reentry at night could have produced a spectacular 
fireworks display visible for hundreds of miles 
there was speculation that a chunk of the satellite involving 
an inchthick titanium plate about 5 feet high by 4 feet wide 
might survive the searing journey through the atmosphere but if 
it did its at the bottom of the indian ocean niemann said i 
think weve heard the last of solar max 
the solar max once given new life by the illfated space 
shuttle challenger succumbed to its decaying orbit after a 
research odyssey in which it traveled 14 billion miles in an 
orbit which normally ranged 300 miles from earth 
launched in february 1980 solar max was the first satellite 
designed to be retrieved by a space shuttle crew that came in 
handy in 1984 when the shuttle challenger drew alongside brought 
the satellite into the cargo bay replaced a failed electronics box 
and sent solar max back on its way 
that was the first satellite repair mission in space a month 
later solar max recorded one of the largest flare eruptions ever 
seen on the sun 
other achievements in solar maxs career 
in 1987 its gamma ray spectrometer was the first instrument to 
detect rays from supernova 1987a a distant star that exploded in a 
neighboring galaxy the magellanic cloud 
it detected 10 comets colliding with the sun the latest on 
sept 28 
its ultraviolet spectrometer detected increases in 
highaltitude ozone levels around the earth just north of the 
equator and decreases just south of the equator 
it recorded more than 12500 solar flares powerful eruptions 
on the sun and made it possible for scientists to measure sunspot 
magnetic fields above the visible surface of the sun for the first 
time 
the satellite orbited at an altitude of 300 miles originally and 
maintained its position with spinning wheels and magnetic torque 
bars but as solar max traveled 14 billion miles its altitude 
gradually lowered until it was subjected to intense heat from 
friction with thicker air 
there was no way to boost it to a higher orbit without help from 
another shuttle and the national aeronautics and space 
administration said it could not fit such a 25 million rescue 
mission into the shuttle schedule 
david douds deputy project manager for satellite servicing 
missions at the nasas goddard space flight center said the public 
got its moneys worth from the 77 million satellite 
it provided a real window into the dynamics of solar activity 
and total output of the sun douds said 
originally the space command had predicted the satellite would 
smash into the atmosphere at 612 am est over the pacific ocean 
and west of the galapagos islands but it had cautioned that the 
projection could be far off the mark because of variables such as 
the satellites attitude at reentry and waves in the upper 
atmosphere 
all along experts had said the chances of fragments hitting a 
populated area were remote more than 80 percent of solar maxs 
orbital path was over water in the united states only hawaii and 
extreme south texas and south florida were on its track

1945 just ahead of invading russian troops she never dreamed she 
would be invited back to her native land to be honored as the poet 
laureate of lithuania 
but thats what happened when the high school chemistry teacher 
became the 20th person the fourth woman and the only foreigner 
to hold the honor in lithuania once an independent country but 
under soviet domination since world war ii 
i was born in lithuania but we left when the russians were 
coming and now i am an american citizen so i am really a 
foreigner in my native land she said 
we left on foot she continued we just walked away the 
russians were only half a mile away and as we left we could see 
them we went to dresden and lived through the dresden firebombing 
i came to the states with 2 in my pocket i was 15 years old 
and a friend of mine had sent me the money 
the young immigrant arrived in baltimore as a sophomore in high 
school but went to work in a factory and finished high school in 
summers and evenings in just over a year she studied chemistry 
because she knew mathematics but not english 
i was in a shakespeare course and i could memorize it but 
didnt know what it meant she said in a recent interview i 
wasnt going to stay in the factory so i worked and went to school 
at notre dame of maryland and got my masters in chemistry 
education 
keblys 55 kept writing all her life in lithuanian 
i was a poet before i was a chemist she said i never 
write in english because i dont have the command of the language 
it has to be your mother tongue im strictly a lithuanian poet i 
teach in english and write in lithuanian 
keblys met her husband kestutis keblys at a lithuanian college 
student meeting in new york the two discovered they had lived in 
villages some 20 miles apart and had left at about the same time to 
spend much of their childhood in refugee camps then came to the 
united states and on to college 
all of keblys work has been published in chicago except her 
last book of poetry kelione a journey which was 
published in lithuania she writes under her maiden name vitalija 
bogutaite 
her husband describes her poetry as not nationalistic in a 
direct way but in a symbolic way she brings out concerns about 
national survival and the oppression of the war years

to time reveals some of her attachment to her native country 
when you will tear and divide 
the steaming loaf of rye 
remember that it too swayed and ripened 
in the fields of my homeland

participate in the festival an event that draws crowds comparable 
to footballgame crowds in the united states 
this summer she went with her husband to the festival and didnt 
know she had won the prize until she arrived its 500ruble prize 
worth about 350 at the time was about what a lithuanian doctor 
would earn in three months she said 
i didnt expect to get the prize she said saturday i 
just went to sit in and celebrate with them at the poetry festival 
when i got off the plane in moscow i was told i won the prize as

the army began disarming the 
communist partys paramilitary force on saturday putting thousands 
of rifles into warehouses at the demand of opposition leaders 
and czechoslovakias leading dissident warned the new coalition 
government being formed this weekend to implement democratic 
reforms without delay or face renewed opposition from millions who 
have taken to the streets 
the peoples militia the force created 40 years ago to protect 
the workplace from counterrevolution and later guarded the 
communists monopoly on power began surrendering weapons to the 
army the staterun news agency ctk reported all weapons were 
expected to be in army hands by sunday 
this is to honor a pledge by the new communist leadership that 
in the solution of the current political situation the 
paramilitary means of the party will not be used an unnamed 
politburo member was quoted as saying 
the action came one day after politburo member vasil mohorita 
agreed to turn over control of the communists militia to the state 
as a concession to opposition demands that the militia be disbanded 
there was no mention of the future of the militia 
the grayuniformed militia is a paid parttime force that is 
believed to have tens of thousands of members recruited from among 
workers it was last used in january to help riot police smash a 
weeklong series of demonstrations in prague 
in its terse dispatch ctk noted that the politburo spokesman 
made the announcement after concerns were expressed by segments of 
the population over increased movement of military vehicles on 
czechoslovak territory 
that was an obvious attempt to dispel any fears of army 
intervention to reverse the democratic reforms that have been 
promised 
the beleaguered communistcontrolled government last week agreed 
to appoint a new government by sunday that will include 
noncommunists for the first time since warsaw pact tanks crushed 
prague spring reforms in 1968 
playwright vaclav havel a leader of the civic forum opposition 
group said the rapid pace of change must continue 
if we are to structure our society in a democratic peaceful 
decent and loving way and avoid possible conflicts then it is 
necessary for the government to act quickly and not only declare 
certain things but really implement them he told the communist 
party daily rude pravo 
any kind of postponement or delay would turn not only against 
us that is in this case the civic forum but also against the 
government and the entire society havel said 
it would mean that all of us failed to manage the situation 
he added 
havel spoke after six tough hours of negotiations friday with 
czech prime minister frantisek pitra on the shape of the new 
government 
federal premier ladislav adamec agreed tuesday in talks with 
havel and other civic forum representatives to include 
noncommunists in the government an announcement was expected 
sunday government spokesman marcel jansen said 
because czechoslovakia is a federation of the czech and slovak 
republics formation of the new federal government will have to be 
accompanied by overhauls in the czech and slovak governments 
justice and education for instance two key areas in which the 
opposition seeks reforms are controlled by the republic 
governments 
civic forum spokesman jiri dienstbier told the associated press 
the opposition is not proposing specific candidates for the new 
cabinet but concentrating on outlining what characteristics the 
office holders should have 
communists members of previously docile allied parties and 
nonparty people are acceptable to civic forum if they have no 
obvious blemishes in their pasts and are willing to implement 
reforms now that will lead to free elections and genuine democracy 
dienstbier said 
civic forum established only 13 days ago is an umbrella 
movement of opposition groups its leaders have said they are not 
offering themselves for cabinet posts but have left open the 
possibility of accepting nominations 
i am a writer by profession and id like to stay one havel 
said when asked by rude pravo if he aimed for office i never 
had ambitions of being a politician i dont feel qualified for 
it 
id like to get back into the theater he said havels 
plays were banned for 20 years here until censorship was largely 
removed last week 
i firmly believe and hope that it will not be necessary for 
me to become a politician and that the common good which i always 
place above my own interests is not going to force me into 
anything of the kind havel said 
the formation of the new government will cap a week of historic 
changes brought on by 11 days of antigovernment demonstrations 
and a nationwide general strike monday that sent millions into the 
streets 
on tuesday adamec agreed to include noncommunists in the 
government 
on wednesday parliament formally removed the communists 
guaranteed leading role in politics from the constitution a 
politburo member said free elections would be held within a year 
on friday the communists dramatically reversed 21 years of 
policy condemning the 1968 invasion that crushed the prague 
spring reforms and paving the way for a formal reassessment by 
the warsaw pact in moscow later this month 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev swiftly followed the 
admission by saying the 1968 reforms were correct and democratic 
and that the sovietled invasion was an inappropriate response 
from moscow

george bush commanderinchief of 
the worlds largest navy was marooned on his own ship saturday as 
a fierce december gale bewildered the bestlaid plans of superpower 
leaders protesters and local tourism officials 
this is the type of weather that shipwrecked saint paul on 
these rocks we usually have this in february said joe cassar a 
government official on malta host country to the snakebit 
superpower summit 
winds gusting to 60 miles per hour and thundering foamtopped 
waves forced a postponement of a second round of talks between bush 
and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev until sunday as well as 
cancellation of a scheduled dinner 
the weather also played havoc at the fringes of the summit a 
big antinuclear parade was postponed until sunday and raisa 
gorbachevs schedule of sightseeing on the island was disrupted 
this wasnt what local tourism officials had in mind either a 
government travel brochure describes malta as the perfect winter 
holiday destination 
the sun worshipper who flees northern europes cold and damp 
winter weather finds in malta the perfect refuge the brochure 
says adding that the island s mild winter climate makes it 
possible to practice quite a variety of winter sports 
be that as it may seas that built overnight forced a change of 
sites for the opening session between bush and gorbachev 
instead of holding the morning meeting aboard the soviet cruiser 
slava the leaders met aboard a soviet luxury liner docked at a 
pier in a more sheltered part of the bay the liner the maxim 
gorky normally caters to west german tourists on north sea cruises 
bush crossed the choppy bay from his summit headquarters aboard 
the uss belknap to the gorky without incident on a canopycovered 
admirals barge but returning after lunch was more of a problem as 
the heaving launch had to make three passes before it could safely 
deliver bush to the us ship 
then the weather got worse bush a former naval aviator and 
speedboat enthusiast wound up stuck on the cruiser for the night 
the 60 mile per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship 
this evening but they have made for a very exciting afternoon 
sail said a statement by white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
fitzwater was stranded with bush as were secretary of state 
james a baker iii and national security adviser brent scowcroft 
they cannot get off of the belknap said bakers aide 
margaret tutwiler 
sig rogich director of advance planning for the white house 
was asked if he was disappointed that the elaborately staged scene 
of the ships and meetings had been disrupted by the weather rogich 
frowned slightly and nodded 
the original script called for bush to travel by boat from the 
8600ton belknap to the 12500ton slava to begin his talks with 
gorbachev 
conditions were not bad enough as to endanger anyone on board 
the heavy warships but the waves were rough enough to make getting 
on and off from smaller shuttle craft a major problem 
summit planners apparently considered moving saturdays meeting 
to land but finally decided to use the 25000ton gorky 
gorbachevs floating residence during the weekend it is moored at 
a pier about 1000 yards from the belknap 
moving the talks to the gorky in case of bad weather was one of 
several contingencies that had been discussed prior to the weekend 
said the assistant to the maltese prime minister who has been in 
charge of planning the maltese side of the meeting 
it is december in the mediterranean said richard cacchia 
caruana noting the weather is always undependable this time of 
year we made sure that both the soviets and the americans knew 
about it 
weve done the best we could in three weeks said cacchia 
caruana philosophically we really couldnt do anything about the 
weather 
fear of bad weather was one reason it was decided to hold the 
summit in marsaxlokk bay rather than further off the coast of 
malta he said 
cold air from western russia appeared to be the culprit for the 
low pressure system causing the strong easterly winds over the 
central mediterranean said maltese meteorologist spiro agius 
it will definitely be improving tomorrow agius added 
but maybe not 
forecaster david membrey of the london weather center said to 
expect the strong winds to continue through sunday afternoon

a formation of 
frenchbuilt mirage 2000 jet fighters highlighted a twohour 
military parade here saturday marking the 18th anniversary of the 
1971 merger of seven sheikdoms into the united arab emirates 
desert drummers and torch bearers marched through streets along 
with swordwielding nationals in bedouin robes and headgear as each 
of the emirates also held separate celebrations 
uae president sheik zayed bin sultan al nahyan attended the 
display of ground sea and air weapons at a seafront boulevard in 
abu dhabi about 5000 spectators packed a grandstand 
flanked by his top aides and rulers of the various emirates the 
leader clapped as the mirages swooped low overhead one mirage drew 
an ovation with aerobatics before formations of transport planes 
armed helicopters and interceptors paraded 
the mirage 2000s six in all were delivered a few days ago the 
first batch of a 22 billion deal signed with france in 1985 and 
involving a total of 36 mirages and various types of military 
hardware 
the arrival of the mirages was seen as a sign of improved 
relations with france after a disagreement over a demand that the 
aircraft be equipped with usbuilt sidewinder airtosurface 
missiles 
the parade was attended by french defense minister jeanpierre 
chevenement along with a number of arab cabinet ministers and 
military commanders 
units of the various arms of the 43000strong armed forces took 
part in the parade which also featured frenchmade gazelle and 
alouette iii helicopters crotale exocet and rapier missiles 
ferret scout cars saladin and saracen armored personnel carriers 
usmade hercules and buffalo transport planes and 
britishbuilt hawk jet fighters also were displayed 
it was the first military parade since 1977 armed forces chief 
of staff gen mohammed saeed albadi said the parades had been 
interrupted largely on account of sadness caused by the middle 
east wars and the recent eightyear conflict between iran and 
iraq 
a leading oilexporting nation the uae like its neighboring 
countries of the persian gulf has diverted sizable funds from the 
oil bonanza years of the 1970s to build a strong military 
traditionally armed by britain which controlled the former 
trucial coast sheikdoms from which the uae was formed in 1971 
the federation has spread out its military shopping 
aside from france it has concluded new arms deals with britain 
italy and egypt offering unspecified types of weapons 
albadi said the uae was in the process of strengthening the 
armed forces and will shortly introduce conscription 
the federation comprises abu dhabi dubai sharjah ras 
alkhaimah umm alquwain fujairah and ajman under the leadership 
of the bigger and richer abu dhabi 
the vast revenues from oil sales have helped turn large tracts 
into farmland build light industries and give its estimated 18 
million people one of the worlds highest per capita incomes 
15000 
mainly due to oil and gas sales the countrys gross national 
product increased from 181 billion in 1972 to 2452 billion in 
1989 according to central bank statements 
the federation mainly abu dhabi and dubai produces a total of 
26 million barrels of crude oil a day according to a recent 
statement by oil minister mana saeed otaiba it earned some 35 
billion this year from oil exports but suffers a budget deficit of 
500 million the deficits have been chronic since the world oil 
market weakened in the early 1980s 
sheik zayed in a speech appealed to iran and iraq to hasten the 
pace toward a peace treaty so that the gulf may reap the fruit of 
stability and security 
he also declared his undivided support for the palestinian 
uprising against israel in the west bank and gaza strip asking 
leaders of the world to help the palestinians regain their rights 
and stop the barbaric perpetrations of israel against the arabs in 
occupied territory 
he urged the people and leaders of lebanon to patch up their 
differences and push their country toward national reconciliation

black nationalist nelson 
mandela eventually will be freed from prison president fw de 
klerk said saturday but he refused to say when 
meanwhile police used dogs whips and batons to break up 
protest rallies in durban and cape town witnesses said while a 
march to a police station in the rural orange free state was 
allowed 
de klerk returned from a visit to the ivory coast which has 
demanded that mandela be released before it agrees to establish 
diplomatic relations with south africa 
as and when it is possible he will be released but i am not 
prepared to speculate on when de klerk told a news conference in 
yamoussoukro after a day of talks with president felix 
houphouetboigny in the ivory coast 
mandela 71 was convicted of sabotage and subversion in 1964 
and is serving a life term last year the african national 
congress leader was admitted to a hospital with tuberculosis and 
later transferred to a home on a prison farm 
de klerk said he was hopeful that south africa could establish 
relations with the ivory coast whose president has praised his 
reforms 
i dont think it is a dream it can become a reality he 
said 
houphouetboigny has made clear that though he favors closer 
economic ties with south africa and favors negotiations to end 
apartheid mandela must be released before full relations can be 
established 
police used whips and dogs to break up an attempted march by 
thousands of blacks against inadequate housing and rent increases 
in durban said a journalist who said children were trampled as 
the crowd fled in all directions shoppers and people posting 
christmas mail were dragged away to police vehicles 
police said they used rubber batons to disperse thousands of 
people who marched in the streets in defiance of a police order

a bomb was tossed from a speeding car 
saturday at the south lebanon home of information minister edmond 
rizk a foe of christian gen michel aoun causing damage but no 
injuries police said 
also saturday aouns command accused syrian forces of firing at 
a lebanese army helicopter hovering over thousands of aoun 
supporters forming a human wall around his headquarters in the 
presidential palace 
a communique said eight supporters were wounded by falling 
shrapnel from a syrian antiaircraft barrage which missed the 
helicopter 
gen aoun bestowed military medals on the eight injured 
youths the communique said it did not specify the seriousness 
of their injuries 
the syrian army command in lebanon did not comment 
the incident occurred a few hours before the arrival of eight 
french lawmakers to declare support for aoun who opposes lebanons 
syrianbacked president and has vowed to drive syrian troops out of 
lebanon 
rizk a maronite like aoun was in moslem west beirut when his 
house was bombed at 1030 am in his hometown of jizzine 25 miles 
south of the capital 
his wife and children who were at the house escaped injury 
according to police 
rizk was among the lebanese legislators who approved an 
arabbrokered peace plan for lebanon in a special parliament 
session in taif saudi arabia in october aoun opposed the accord 
because it does not set a timetable for the withdrawal of the 
40000 syrian troops in lebanon 
the accord cleared the way for election of a president 
rizk was named information minister in lebanons newly formed 
national reconciliation government which was entrusted with 
applying the taif accord to end 14 years of civil war 
rizks house was the first to be attacked in areas controlled by 
the south lebanon army a predmoninantly christian militia allied 
with israel 
there were similar bomb attacks on the homes of eight other 
legislators in the christian enclave controlled by aouns army in 
the past five weeks 
rizk blamed the attack on gen aoun and agents he recruited to 
undermine the whole of lebanon 
the rightwing french parliamentarians did not make any 
statements when they arrived at the shellwrecked presidential 
palace in baabda five miles east of beirut 
they held a brief meeting with aoun who refuses to give up the 
palace to president elias hrawi hrawi was elected by parliament 
last month after rene mouawad was assassinated by a bomb after 17 
days in office 
the french legislators then joined a dance with some of the 
thousands of christian youths camped in the woods around the palace 
since tuesday to raise the ante if syria decides to attack aoun 
last week 33 rightwing french parliament members visited the 
christian enclave for 24 hours to declare support for aoun 
the moslem voice of the nation radio said the final decision on 
how to evict aoun from the palace will be taken this week 
it said hrawi agreed to delay the move in an effort to prevent 
bloodshed 
but if aoun refuses to end his mutiny peacefully then the 
proper decision will be taken the radio said 
annahar an independent daily quoted hrawi as saying an 
assault to dislodge aoun has been delayed at the request of a 
number of arab and foreign states that he did not identify 
but at a news conference thursday hrawi said the day of 
judgment is very near hrawi a maronite christian like aoun 
stressed that he hoped aoun would leave the palace peacefully 
hrawis remark coincided with a buildup of syrian tanks 
artillery and commando forces around the 310squaremile christian 
enclave north of beirut an apparent preparation for an assault to 
dislodge aoun 
syrian troops were deployed in lebanon in 1976 under an arab 
league peacekeeping mandate to quell the civil war fighting aoun 
said they abrogated the mandate by siding with the moslems

new reformminded communist party leaders 
have condemned the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of czechoslovakia in 
which bulgarian troops took part the staterun news agency bta 
said saturday 
each of the five warsaw pact nations that joined in the invasion 
of their neighbor has recently criticized the operation soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev on friday called the invasion an 
inappropriate response 
the ruling party politburo and the government studied the issue 
and noted that the decision to crush czechoslovakias prague 
spring reforms was conditioned by the international situation at 
the end of the 1960s bta said 
bta said that situation was characterized by confrontation 
armament races and relentless ideological fighting the warsaw 
pact decision to send tanks and troops was influenced by deformed 
concepts of socialist society 
looking back from todays point of view bta said and 
from the positions of restructuring and new political thinking the 
action taken in august 1968 is assessed as unjustifiable and 
illegal 
history has proved it to be wrong and incompatible with the 
new course of the bulgarian communist party and the bulgarian 
state said bta which reflects government policy 
referring to the moves toward democratization in czechoslovakia 
bta said the dynamic processes which have been recently triggered 
in czechoslovakia are received in bulgaria with understanding and 
sympathy 
led by the soviet union every warsaw pact nation except romania 
took part in the 1968 invasion which crushed democratic reforms 
and led to the installation of hardline communist leaders 
the invasion recently has been condemned by leaders of hungary 
poland and east germany as well as czechoslovakia 
bulgarias longtime hardline communist party chief todor 
zhivkov was ousted on nov 10 and replaced by petar mladenov who 
is considered more moderate

a member of yugoslavias collective 
presidency said multiparty democracy is bound to prevail in this 
communistruled nation a zagreb daily reported saturday 
stipe suvar the croatian republics representative in the 
eightperson yugoslav presidency was quoted as saying communism 
is heading for the reconstruction of political freedoms that 
will certainly result in a multiparty system 
his comments were in an interview carried in the vjesnik daily 
newspaper 
i would prefer for two parties to emerge and to creatively 
compete he was quoted as saying adding that even if the 
present communist party were to disintegrate a new party would 
eventually emerge in its ashes 
he also blasted the republic of serbia for severing ties with 
the more liberal republic of slovenia the newspaper reported 
mass serbian rallies cannot make yugoslavia a happier place 
he was quoted as saying 
in an unprecedented move the leadership of serbia yugoslavias 
largest republic broke off all business and government contacts 
with slovenia wednesday after authorities there banned the rally by 
an estimated 40000 serbs they were reportedly seeking the ouster 
of slovenias liberal leadership 
yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous 
provinces each with its own government and party structure 
the decentralized system of government and a collective federal 
presidency were devised to prevent one republic from gaining sway 
over the others but it has often resulted in tensions and 
ineffective government by compromise 
in the interview suvar also described the current 
counterrevolutionary activities trial of azem vlasi a former 
leader of hardline serbias southern province of kosovo as 
unnecessary and harmful for yugoslavia he called for vlasis 
release 
in yugoslavias largest political trial in decades vlasi and 14 
other ethnic albanian defendants are accused of opposing serbia in 
its drive to strengthen its control over the impoverished province 
kosovo has been the scene of continuing unrest that left at 
least 28 people dead this year 
ethnic albanians who make up almost ninetenths of the regions 
19 million people are seeking greater autonomy for their 
province serbia exercises some control over kosovo though it is 
nominally autonomous 
vlasis trial has been sharply criticized in slovenia and by 
international human rights groups

hundreds of israeli troops 
seized uniforms hatchets and homemade swords on saturday during 
housetohouse searches in an area where the army had killed four 
armed palestinians 
at least 30 arabs were detained during the operation which came 
one day after soldiers clashed with seven members of a palestinian 
gang called the black panthers outside a barber shop in the casbah 
quarter of nablus four palestinians were slain during the clash 
in the gaza strip on saturday israeli soldiers shot and wounded 
23 palestinians during a sympathy strike for the four arab reports 
said 
maj gen yitzhak mordechai on saturday blamed the black 
panthers for killing 16 palestinians suspected of collaborating 
with israel and said its activities were directed by yasser 
arafats fatah faction of the plo 
since the start of the palestinian uprising underground groups 
known as strike forces and popular committees have been 
formed to enforce orders of its plobacked leadership some of 
these groups have gradually focused on violent interrogations and 
killings of suspected collaborators as a main activity 
in the past four months of his command mordechai said 130 
hardcore activists had been arrested from groups such as the black 
panthers and red eagles which have used weapons in attacks on 
israeli soldiers and killed palestinians suspected of having ties 
to israeli authorities 
the use of weapons contradicts plo policy against using arms in 
the nearly 2yearold palestinian uprising 
recent leaflets from the proplo underground criticized the 
slaying of alleged collaborators and disowned the renegade actions 
of unauthorized groups 
some 154 palestinians have been killed by other arabs while 624 
palestinians have been killed by israelis during the uprising 
the latest death came saturday when hamad jaber 20 of the west 
bank village of tayasir died of wounds suffered in a clash with 
troops three weeks ago 
mordechai spoke at the site of fridays shootout outside kamals 
salon a barber shop in the casbah quarter where 30000 
palestinians live 
bloodstains broken window panes and shards of porcelain coffee 
cup were seen an army officer said slain black panther leader imad 
nasser 29 was holding the cup when soldiers approached the group 
across the street two palestinian men in their 20s kneeled 
against a graffiticovered wall hands bound behind their backs and 
blindfolded 
army officers said more than 30 palestinians were detained 
saturday unofficial reports estimated the number of detainees at 
60 to 100 
i think the people of nablus will be be grateful to hear that 
this group is under control said mordechai who claimed to have 
documents linking the black panthers to senior fatah officials 
behind this group are highlevel plo officials supporting giving 
money and encouraging them 
there is no serious group left operating in this area said 
col raanan gissin deputy army spokesman who guided reporters on a 
tour of the casbah where a curfew kept residents off the streets 
reporters were taken to a secondary school where soldiers had 
collected dozens of knives and swords piles of uniforms outlawed 
plo flags slingshots posters of arafat wooden clubs and axes 
according to witness accounts from arab reporters israeli 
forces disguised as arabs and wearing arab headdresses arrived 
friday in a red mercedes with distinctive blue west bank license 
plates they surprised the black panthers in the barber shop and 
opened fire 
mordechai described that account as a tall story he said 
the soldiers were in uniform and arrived on foot after being 
alerted by an army lookout 
gissin said two palestinians were killed on the spot and two 
died of wounds later he said one of those killed tried to grab the 
gun of an israeli soldier bloodstains mark the spot where he died 
drops of blood were also visible where three black panthers were 
wounded 
in these kind of clashes you have to fire first if you want 
to survive gissin said the soldiers had no choice but to draw 
fast and fire first 
mordechai said the palestnians did not get off a shot but other 
officers said one palestinian weapon had a bullet in the chamber 
ready to fire

more than 13 years after a car bomb killed an 
investigative reporter for arizonas largest newspaper the murder 
case has been reopened even though the motive is as murky as ever 
when attorney general bob corbin leans back and puts his cowboy 
boots on the desk in his old weststyle office he can choose from 
a tangle of theories about who ordered the death of arizona 
republic reporter don bolles 
theres the mob casinos race track owners bankers even a 
jealous exhusband and there are plots within plots one theory is 
that the hit men collected twice from different people so far 
though only one man has been convicted and the masterminds 
whoever they were remain free 
corbin a republican whose office comes up for election next 
year has been attacked by potential challengers for not solving 
the case but he insists those attacks were not a factor in his 
decision to reinstate a murder charge last week against james 
robison a plumber accused of setting off the bomb 
corbin says he has new evidence but wont say what it is or 
where it points 
you dont need motive for a conviction he said it helps 
but i dont need to show motive 
bolles 47 died 11 days after the radiocontrolled bomb blew up 
his car in a hotel parking lot in june 1976 as he lay dying he 
was heard to say john adamson emprise and mafia 
emprise corp now known as delaware north companies ltd was a 
partner with the funk family of arizona in dogracing tracks 
john harvey adamson 45 who ultimately became the only man 
convicted in the case so far was a greyhound breeder and towtruck 
operator who drank heavily and used cocaine bolles had left a note 
at his desk saying he was planning to meet him to discuss a 
landfraud scheme involving highlevel politicians 
at trial adamson testified in return for leniency saying he 
planted the car bomb and robison triggered it on orders from max 
dunlap a man trying to ingratiate himself with land and liquor 
magnate kemper marley 
marley a target of bolles stories was never charged with the 
crime however and an appeals court threw out the robison and 
dunlap convictions dunlap was released though robison 67 
remains in prison on an unrelated assault conviction 
corbin decided to drop charges against robison and dunlap when 
adamson refused to testify in a retrial unless he got a better deal 
than he originally bargained for corbin arguing that adamson had 
broken the plea bargain brought him to trial and won a murder 
conviction and death sentence he hoped would persuade adamson to 
talk 
a federal appeals court threw out adamsons death sentence 
earlier this year however and corbin filed a new murder charge 
against robison last week without waiting for further appeals to be 
heard by the supreme court a preliminary hearing is scheduled for 
january 
separately a state grand jury is investigating potential 
obstruction of justice charges and has called in witnesses that 
could fit several of the scenarios 
several people including freelance reporter don devereux have 
theorized that bolles may have been killed because he was 
investigating industrial gold thefts and their ties to california 
bankers 
devereux and others have suggested bolles was looking at 
dogtrack skimming however and they cite his dying words 
still others have linked the death to a mafia diary that 
describes casino skimming but that some contend is a forgery 
and some including corbin at one time have pointed to a member 
of the funk family as a contingency suspect saying he resented 
his exwifes closeness with bolles whom she confided in 
some of the theories overlap and there are those who believe 
the hit men may have been paid originally by one person before 
persuading a second who didnt know about the first contract to pay 
for it too 
adamson declined to be interviewed last week and robison 
referred a reporter to his attorney who did not return calls 
the reopening of the case pleased those close to bolles 
his brother richard an author said id just like to know 
the truth 
john winters a bolles colleague who still covers the case 
said you at least have some activity going on in the case

at the sea goddess temple on saturday li 
yingshi tossed the wood blocks once twice three times 
thats it said the grizzled fisherman sea goddess says 
no voting today 
as he hobbled away a young woman in a blue dress took his place 
in front of the altar facing an image of the fetching goddess 
ive never voted before she said with a shy smile after 
tossing the blocks a buddhist ritual i needed advice 
indeed for the first time in taiwans history a legal 
opposition party has given voters something close to real choice in 
the first nationwide elections since martial law was lifted in 1987 
long lines formed at polling booths throughout the island 
weve been going full steam since 8 am said one police 
officer at a polling station near the sea goddess temple in 
northern taipei its just getting busier 
as he spoke three elderly women moved slowly out of the voting 
booth 
we choose the opposition said one as she stood between her 
two sisters clutching their hands we talked about it last night 
and decided to vote our mind the people must speak 
the opposition or democratic progressive party ran a spirited 
campaign against the ruling nationalist party which has governed 
taiwan since 1949 when it fled mainland china after losing a civil 
war to the communists 
the dpp finds its strength mostly among the taiwanese working 
class who were here when the mainlanders came over from china 
the opposition portrayed the nationalists as corrupt accusing 
them of votebuying and using staterun television to push 
nationalist candidates 
the nationalists depicted the opposition as a chaotic band of 
radicals ready to proclaim taiwans cultural and political 
independence from china 
the issue was an emotional one because china has warned it could 
attack taiwan if this island of 20 million proclaims independence 
it also cut to the heart of the nationalists claim on power ever 
since fleeing to taiwan the nationalists have said they alone are 
the legitimate government of china 
hugh g chang an 83yearold retired ministry of finance 
official fled to taiwan in 1948 to help set up a government for 
the beleagured nationalists and their leader generalissimo chiang 
kaishek 
after years of supporting chiangs martial law policies chang 
said he now he supports political liberalization 
but slowly slowly he said banging his cane on the 
pavement his grandson chang yinlien agreed 
instability is a bad thing said the 25yearold law student 
who voted for the nationalists with his grandfather in western 
taipei we want calm for taiwan 
their viewpoint is common among taiwans people strongly 
influenced by confucian ethics that worship harmony 
still some voters said they didnt agree 
a little turmoil may not be a bad thing said one voter 
after casting his ballot for the opposition its like marriage 
if you dont argue you never make up

the memory of four previous riots this decade hangs 
over miami as the racially charged manslaughter trial of a 
policeman nears its end but this time there is hope the bloodshed 
can be avoided 
ive got a very good feeling about it miamis mayor xavier 
suarez said friday after a visit to an school in a predominantly 
black neighborhood i think a couple of blacks on the jury 
thats very helpful the process is going to be viewed this time as 
complex but fair 
barring lastminute delays the case of officer william lozano 
31 accused of manslaughter in the deaths of a black motorcyclist 
and his passenger is expected to go to the sixmember jury later 
this week the trial was recessed on friday until monday 
lozano faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of clement 
lloyd 23 and lloyds passenger allan blanchard 24 lozano shot 
lloyd in the head killing him instantly blanchard also black 
died the next day of head injuries suffered in the subsequent crash 
four times since 1980 including the jan 16 shooting that led 
to the current trial racial disturbances were touched off by 
violent encounters between police and blacks or by the subsequent 
acquittal of the officers by allwhite juries 
willie sims a black member of dade countys community relations 
board says he has felt the difference participation in the legal 
system makes in the communitys reaction 
you have blacks on the jury you have a black prosecutor 
says sims it definitely goes a long way toward defusing the 
situation you reduce the perception of unfairness 
another difference is that the local media have given almost 
blanket coverage of the trial the school districts television 
station wlrn runs a complete tape of the days proceedings each 
night radio station winzam interrupts its programming with live 
broadcasts from the trial several commercial television 
broadcasters including cable news network nationally carried 
lozanos appearance live on thursday 
the media have acted more responsibly than before the previous 
riots asserts marvin dunn a prominent black sociologist and 
author of a book on the may 1980 riot that left 18 people dead 
that violence followed the acquittal of policemen accused of 
beating to death black insurance executive arthur mcduffie 
i just dont have a sense of any tremendous support for a riot 
in the wake of an acquittal dunn says in going around the 
community you dont hear the same level of anger as before the 
mcduffie riot there is an overwhelming sentiment in the 
community for peace 
another difference is that unlike 1980 the city police are 
ready this time if there is unrest 
the department has 700 new gas masks and two armored vehicles 
and has upgraded shields batons and other equipment says police 
spokesman david rivero police will move in quickly at the first 
sign of trouble 
we have a major plan where every policeman in this entire 
department has an assignment rivero says we are going to put 
everybody in jail who breaks the law 
but not everyone shares the optimism of local officials or 
feels that two black jurors will be enough to prevent violence in 
case of an acquittal 
at the nu lounge a bar only 100 feet or so from where lozano 
shot lloyd many patrons fear the trial will end in a replay of 
what they see as a long history of injustice 
since 1919 until today its been the same get the 
nigger says joseph williams 72 a lifelong resident of the 
community he mentions the mcduffie case and the 1982 shooting of 
nevell johnson a black in a video arcade only a few blocks away 
which both sparked rioting 
in 1984 violence broke out again when an allwhite jury 
acquitted miami police officer luis alvarez in johnsons shooting 
all these things make the guy in the street feel like a 
policeman can kill me because im black says ivory lewis a 
former policeman and now a longshoreman thats why people want a 
guilty verdict so they feel our childrens lives are worth 
something 
while attention has focused on black neighborhoods where the 
riots took place the case also has riveted the attention of south 
floridas hispanic community especially the 200000 colombians 
who constitute the regions secondlargest latin ethnic group 
after cubanamericans 
even in lozanos homeland of colombia news of the trial is 
carried in detail by the media and a fundraising drive has helped 
pay the expenses of his legal defense 
support for the policeman is widespread says dario restrepo a 
member of floridas official commission on hispanic affairs and 
governor of the colombian american chamber of commerce 
lozanos brothers and his wife are all law enforcement officers 
he notes a welcome relief to a nationality whose country has 
become synonymous with cocaine trafficking

president bush proposed to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev on saturday that nato and the warsaw 
pact conclude a treaty to reduce conventional forces in europe next 
year and sign the accord at an international summit meeting in 
vienna us officials said 
the proposal was part of a presentation on arms control trade 
human rights and other ussoviet issues that bush outlined at the 
opening round of talks with gorbachev at their stormtossed summit 
according to officials who asked not to be identified by name 
bush also suggested that secretary of state james a baker iii 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze meet next month 
in the soviet union to resolve several key issues blocking 
agreement on a separate treaty to reduce us and soviet longrange 
nuclear weapons by 30 to 50 percent the officials said 
that pact would be signed at a superpower summit to be held in 
the united states which bush suggested be held in the second half 
of june according to officials 
the recommendations extended to a call for the two summit 
partners to jointly propose berlin as the site for the olympic 
games in 2004 a gesture that would dramatize the improvement in 
eastwest relations 
on the negative side bush told gorbachev the continued delivery 
of soviet arms to leftist rebels in el salvador through surrogates 
was the single most destructive factor in the superpower 
relationship said the officials 
the us officials said gorbachev did not respond directly to 
any of bushs initiatives presumably the response at least in 
part would come on sunday during a final day of talks 
on the armscontrol front officials said that bush was willing 
to end production of us chemical weapons once an international 
treaty is put into operation to ban poison gas 
on trade issues the officials said bush told the soviet leader 
the united states would support granting moscow observer status in 
the general agreement on tariffs and trade a 97nation trade 
organization once the kremlin eases emigration restrictions as it 
has promised 
bush also proposed negotiations begin on a trade agreement that 
would also lift tariff and import controls against soviet goods 
entering the united states the official said 
the trade restrictions were imposed by congress in the mid1970s 
with the aim of forcing the exodus of soviet jews the official 
made clear that bushs offers were conditional based on completion 
of soviet legislation to establish freedom of travel completion of 
that landmark law is expected within a month 
one of the restrictive us laws known as the jacksonvanik 
amendment has for many years denied the soviet union the kind of 
access to us markets enjoyed by most other nations by imposing 
high tariffs the other legislation known as the stevenson 
amendment denies export credits to moscow 
apart from imminent action on emigration the soviet union is in 
the midst of reconstructing its economy under gorbachevs 
perestroika campaign 
a us official said that bush urged gorbachev to move toward a 
marketpricing system but he gave no indication how gorbachev 
responded to any of the presidents propositions but gorbachev is 
known to want soviet entry to the general agreement on tariffs and 
trade gatt 
bush proposed only observer status for the soviets not full 
membership it would be granted next year the official said 
bushs proposal for an international summit in vienna follows 
one by gorbachev last week to have the leaders of the united 
states canada and 33 european countries meet next year to ease 
eastwest divisions 
the treaty that would be signed is under negotiation in the 
austrian capital between nato and the warsaw pact it would reduce 
us and soviet troops in europe to 275000 each and also cut 
tanks artillery and other nonnuclear weapons from the atlantic 
ocean to the ural mountains in the soviet union 
the two key obstacles at this point concern what kinds of 
airplanes to scale back and whether to include a turkish port 
through which supplies flow to turkish troops on cyprus 
the strategic arms reduction treaty known as start is under 
negotiation in geneva between the united states and the soviet 
union 
bush said baker and shevardnadze should focus on such nagging 
problems as how many nucleartipped airlaunched cruise missiles to 
be permitted whether missiles not deployed on bombers submarines 
or in silos should be scrapped and measures to prevent the 
disguising of missile tests 
in the area of human right bush told gorbachev that all 
outstanding human rights cases should be resolved before that 
meeting an official said 
he presented a list of cases to the soviet leader the number 
was not disclosed

the leader of the ukrainian catholic church urged 
millions of faithful in the soviet ukraine on saturday to take 
advantage of new concessions allowing them to register with 
authorities 
we have prayed for this day for over 43 years and god has 
answered our prayers romebased cardinal myroslav lubachivsky 
said our suffering is coming to an end 
lubachivsky was referring to fridays announcement by government 
officials in the ukraine that ukrainian catholics could officially 
register their congregations like other religious groups the 
church has been banned since 1946 
the move came as pope john paul ii was holding historic talks at 
the vatican with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
i call upon our faithful in ukraine to avail themselves of 
this right and to begin to register our congregations with 
authorities as soon as possible lubachivsky said in a statement 
he described the decision by ukrainian officials as a first 
step toward complete legalization of the church which was 
suppressed by dictator josef stalin in 1946 and forced to merge 
with the russian orthodox church 
according to western estimates there are 4 million to 6 million 
catholics in the ukraine until recently they practiced their 
faith clandestinely but in recent months many have emerged to 
worship openly and demand official recognition 
the pope on friday urged gorbachev to assure full religious 
freedom for the ukrainian church and all soviet catholics 
estimated at 10 million gorbachev pledged that a new law 
guaranteeing religious freedom for all faiths would be adopted soon 
and he invited the pope to visit the country 
we extend our sincere and deep gratitude to the pope for his 
unwavering support of our church said lubachivsky former 
metropolitanarchbishop of philadelphia 
he urged ukrainian catholics to work patiently and according 
to the law with the authorities and to respect the churches now 
controlled by the russian orthodox church 
the russian orthodox have opposed legalization of the ukrainian 
catholic church they stand to lose hundreds of churches and 
thousands of followers they gained with the suppression of the 
catholics

a private investigator who secretly 
distributed bibles behind the iron curtain for nearly 15 years says 
hes happy that religious reforms in the soviet bloc may end his 
days as a smuggler for god 
ive been able to smuggle in 25 million in scriptures since 
the middle 1970s ted grevers said the days of smuggling are 
over 
president mikhail s gorbachev pledged friday to pope john paul 
ii that he would establish diplomatic ties with the vatican and 
guarantee religious freedom in the soviet union gorbachev said 
people have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs 
many christians behind the iron curtain have been praying for 
this for years grevers said i didnt think this was going to 
happen its a tremendous milestone 
grevers a former elder of the cascade christian church in grand 
rapids who owns fatman international private detective service 
says he has made about 30 trips behind the iron curtain to 
distribute bibles and medicine he says he has smuggled bibles into 
the soviet union east germany czechoslovakia hungary poland 
bulgaria romania and albania 
the bibles were taken in by car barge train some with 
tourists all material was given to me by various missions 
throughout the us and germany on an anonymous basis he said 
for instance some trucks going from the west to the east 
would be delivering food and other goods some drivers would be 
christians and help us grevers said there are many ingenious 
ways you can penetrate these countries 
grevers whose church is part of the disciples of christ 
denomination said he received most of his financial backing from 
amish and mennonite churches in northern indiana 
in the past year grevers said he and others have been allowed 
to mail bibles into the soviet union but romania and albania 
which have resisted the wave of liberalization sweeping the rest of 
the east bloc remain difficult to penetrate he said 
now were concentrating on shipping several truckloads of 
medicine through our church contacts he said the medicine is 
distributed to baptist union church in warsaw poland then sent to 
various christian denominations a jewish group a roman catholic 
convent and various nursing homes he said

eden pastora the daring sandinista 
guerrilla leader known as commander zero who switched sides to the 
contra rebels returns sunday to resume his fight this time on the 
political field 
pastora will join others who gave up the armed struggle and now 
are seeking power through nicaraguas feb 25 general elections 
i am going to nicaragua because everybody knows me and my 
military and political career i am going to tell the people what 
is best for them i am like the phoenix that rises from his 
ashes he said by telephone last week from costa rica 
however the arrival of the charismatic former sandinista vice 
minister of defense is expected to add little more than spice to 
the campaign 
pastora has pledged to support the small social christian party 
by attacking the two main political blocs the sandinista front 
and the national opposition union known as uno 
eric ramirez the social christian presidential candidate is 
expected to finish a distant third independent polls and political 
observers give sandinista president daniel ortega an edge over the 
unos violeta chamorro in his bid for reelection 
but adversity will not stop the fiery pastora who says he has 
survived because jesus is on his side 
his arrival represents an option for a solution that rejects 
war and marxism and seeks to rescue the true values of the 
revolution that overthrew anastasio somoza ramirez said 
others disagree 
the man is a guerrilla all he knows how to do is fight he 
has no political ideology said jaime chamorro assistant 
director of the opposition newspaper la prensa which backs his 
mother mrs chamorro is the newspapers director 
the sandinistas hope pastoras charisma has worn out 
pastora 52 has been working in costa rica on a fishing 
cooperative with members of his former guerrilla band since 1986 
when he gave up the fight 
he became known worldwide aug 20 1978 when he led 20 rebels 
in a daring assault on the national palace the rebels held scores 
of congressmen hostage until they obtained the release of 50 
sandinistas held in the prisons of thenpresident somoza 
among those released was a young rebel daniel ortega who went 
on to become president and tomas borge now interior minister 
a photograph of pastora smiling and holding a rifle aloft as he 
boarded the plane that took his comrades out the country was a 
great propaganda boost for the sandinista cause 
he led the sandinistas southern guerrilla front and in july 
1979 marched into managua with the victorious forces to become vice 
minister ofdefense and one of the most popular sandinista leaders 
but pastora always called himself a nationalist and never 
identified entirely with radical leftist colleagues in the 
sandinista leadership they in turn considered him a politically 
unstable man with more guts than brains 
in 1983 pastora disappeared from public view months later he 
announced he was taking up arms against the sandinistas accusing 
them of betraying the revolution and trying to establish a marxist 
regime 
pastora organized a guerrilla force along the costa rican border 
and admitted he was getting some covert funds from the us 
government 
a master of the surprise attack he briefly took over the 
pacific port town of san juan del sur 
in 1984 he was wounded in a bomb attempt at a jungle hideout in 
southern nicaragua during a news conference to which he had invited 
a large number of journalists 
the cia withdrew financial support from his group in 1986 he 
accused the united states of giving all its support to the contra 
groups led by former somoza national guard officers 
we want a movement that is free of influence from the united 
states and from moscow pastora said last week 
he dismissed mrs chamorro as an honorable woman worthy of all 
respect but not a politician she is being used by the extreme 
right just as she was was used by the extreme left 
mrs chamorro whose husband was murdered by the somoza 
government served on the first sandinista junta before resigning 
after a year 
pastora will be able to campaign but not vote because he did not 
register in october

just when quakefrazzled san franciscans 
were recovering their equilibrium the collapse of a construction 
crane and other accidents are rattling them all over again 
some are crying some are laughing so they wont cry 
quake jokes have been big on the comedy circuit since the oct 
17 shaker which measured 71 on the richter scale now crane jokes 
are starting to make the rounds after the 16story plunge of a 
giant crane last tuesday that killed five people and injured 21 
its hard to feel safe anywhere after a week when in addition 
to the crane accident a bus and train collided killing two and a 
street caved in from a broken water main 
oddball theories abound on the cause of the troubles 
astrologers claim the calamities were preordained based on the 
citys birth date of jan 30 1847 when the pueblo of yerba 
buena became san francisco 
san francisco is moving into a period of bad luck and 
disasters being injured in our tenderest places while being in a 
position of negative publicity and changes in our image said 
astrologer jayj jacobs 
the string of bad breaks continued friday when mayor art agnos 
was hit by a big wave and slammed into a beach in hawaii agnos 
who was on the island of maui to speak about earthquake 
preparedness and crisis management broke his collarbone and will 
need to wear a brace for two to three weeks mayors spokesman 
scott shafer said 
the mayor scoffs at suggestions the city is cursed but worries 
that a disaster a day will keep tourists away 
the recent accidents though spectacular did not result in a 
larger number of deaths or injuries than occur daily in many big 
cities but san francisco for all its glamour and international 
presence is a relatively small place the population is about 
onetenth that of new york and events are magnified 
crisis hotlines are so busy callers often are put on hold 
mental health clinics are packed with stressedout patients some 
afraid to go into tall buildings cross bridges or ride 
doubledecker freeways 
calls to the suicide prevention and related hotlines for people 
with problems such as drugs or marriage troubles were up 30 percent 
in the first couple of weeks after the quake reaching about 260 a 
day 
though the number of calls has since eased off the numbers 
dont tell the whole story because callers in the past week have 
tended to be more upset on average and each takes longer to help 
said eve meyer executive director of san francisco suicide 
prevention 
the calls weve been getting this week are more intense 
said meyer the events this week triggered memories of the quake 
and the fact that this is happening during the start of the holiday 
stress season is adding to the anxiety weve burned out a lot of 
volunteers in the last month 
if comedy is tragedy plus time as alan alda observes in woody 
allens latest film crimes and misdemeanors then san 
francisco is getting funnier every day 
humor is a defense mechanism says comedian mark pitta 
when the quake first happened there was nothing funny about it 
there was no way i was going to make fun of the bay bridge or i880 
collapse but after a grace period you could start telling jokes 
now so many things are happening its ridiculous 
pitta suggests that the networks are going to keep crews out 
here all the time just to wait for disasters 
the thousands of people complaining of feeling more vulnerable 
these days are experiencing a normal reaction but they should seek 
help if the fear gets too intense or lasts more than a couple of 
months psychologists say 
many people have had trouble sleeping or eating properly 
said rosemary martinez a social worker and psychological clinician 
at the mission crisis unit but when they are unable to leave 
home because its the only place they feel safe at that point they 
really need to be seen on an emergency basis 
recent immigrants the homeless and people dealing with personal 
tragedies are more severely affected psychologically by the 
disasters said dr allen turpin a psychiatrist who treats many 
soviet immigrants 
its been really traumatic for them especially the older and 
more recent immigrants turpin said they still cant sleep 
well it seems everything is still shaking 
their lives are unsettled and this exacerbates what theyre 
already going through 
one newcomer to the region has been closer to the disasters than 
most but shes vowing to keep on 
joyce vincentz a 25yearold new jersey native was aboard a 
commuter train that plowed into a chartered bus monday the next 
morning she arrived for work in the financial district minutes 
after the 240ton crane fell onto a busy street 
after each accident she called her mother in new jersey to 
assure her she was ok 
after the earthquake everybody in the east asked me if i was 
packing my bags she said i said no it will take more than 
an earthquake and then i was on the train so my mother asked 
if i was going to pack my bags and i said no it will take more 
than that

thousands of communist party members jeered 
party leader egon krenz on saturday and booed his promises of 
change as he appeared at a rally on the eve of meeting that could 
lead to changes in the leadership 
we dont believe you anymore party members shouted at krenz 
as he addressed the rally in front of the central committee 
building in east berlin 
the crowd booed and whistled when krenz promised the party 
leadership would thoroughly investigate disclosures of massive 
corruption and high living among top party officials 
too late they shouted 
krenz 52 has been trying desperately to distance himself from 
the old hardline leadership of which he was a prominent member 
he replaced party leader erich honecker on oct 18 and began a 
campaign to disclose abuse and purge the old guard 
however immediate reform efforts did not stop the exodus of 
thousands to the west and the huge street demonstrations and 
krenzs support in june for chinas crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators has been another obstacle in his effort to win over 
the public 
krenzs government bowed to pressure nov 9 by opening east 
german borders and the berlin wall to allow citizens to travel 
freely he has denied living opulently as other leaders did under 
honecker 
krenz earlier in the day spoke to his party organization in 
barth near rostock and repeated that he was ready to resign as 
party leader if that was what the party rankandfile wanted 
adn reported that several regional party leaders called for 
krenz and the 10member politburo to resign and that several 
thousand people also took part in oppositionorganized rallies in 
rostock and magdeburg 
late saturday 15000 people rallied in the town of plauen near 
the border with west germany to press for quicker reform and call 
for a referendum on german reunification adn said 
the activists also expressed support for a twohour warning 
strike set for wednesday to press demands for more rapid change 
adn said 
a senior communist who said he lost faith in the leadership 
resigned and party members at bergmannborsig a heavy industry 
factory in east berlin called for krenzs ouster 
as the chairman of an election commission responsible for 
faking election results egon krenz is unacceptable to us they 
said in a statement published by the party newspaper berliner 
zeitung 
krenz supervised this summers municipal elections which

president bush at a summit meeting 
abbreviated by stormy winds and high seas presented mikhail s 
gorbachev on saturday with a wideranging plan to speed work on 
arms control treaties and lower trade barriers to help moscows 
ailing economy us officials said 
the soviet leader made no immediate response to bushs 
proposals officials added although both sides said the first day 
of talks went smoothly 
things went well they talked about everything arms europe 
philosophical questions soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
after five hours of discussions 
later came the embarrassing announcement that weather had 
stranded bush aboard his ship the uss belknap within view of 
the luxury liner maxim gorky where gorbachev awaited him for 
afternoon talks the session was scrubbed along with dinner 
us officials said bush recommended that next years proposed 
summit in the united states the target date for signing a pact 
for deep cuts in long range nuclear weapons be held in late june 
and called for speedy work on a treaty to reduce conventional 
forces in europe 
they added that the trade proposals included granting the 
soviets observer status at a 97nation international trade 
organization conditioned on loosened soviet emigration policies 
bush also urged gorbachev to resolve the problems of divided 
families in 1990 and gave him a list of names of people that he 
recommended should be granted emigration rights officials said 
officials speaking on condition of anonymity said bush 
complained about the continued delivery of sovietmade weapons 
through third countries to leftist rebels in el salvador saying it 
was the most destructive element of superpower relations the us 
officials said gorbachev replied he didnt know how the arms were 
getting to the rebels 
the two leaders were smiling and in high spirits as they began 
their session clasping hands across a long rectangular table that 
measured barely a yard across 
its so narrow that if we dont have enough arguments well 
kick each other gorbachev told bush 
if the schedule holds the two leaders will end their summit 
early sunday afternoon and depart from this stormtossed 
mediterranean island with bush heading for brussels to brief nato 
allies and gorbachev flying to moscow to report to warsaw pact 
leaders 
soviet officials told that the united states was putting out 
its side of the story said they would wait until sunday to react 
publicly 
but earlier senior soviet officials said gorbachev wanted the 
summit to produce a timetable for completing ussoviet treaties 
on reducing strategic nuclear weapons conventional forces in 
central europe and chemical weapons 
bush recommended that secretary of state james a baker iii and 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze meet next month to 
resolve key obstacles to a treaty to slash longrange nuclear 
weapons by up to 50 percent officials said 
on another arms front bush said nato and the warsaw pact should 
conclude a treaty to reduce conventional forces in europe next year 
and sign the agreement at an international summit in vienna the 
officials added 
and bush said he would be willing to halt production of us 
chemical weapons once an international treaty is reach to ban 
poison gas 
on the economic front bush promised anew to lift trade 
restrictions against the soviet union once it enacts legislation to 
ease emigration barriers the officials said 
if that condition is met bush said the united states would 
support soviet participation as an observer at an international 
trade forum the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
he also called on gorbachev to join him in recommending berlin 
as the site for the olympic games in 2004 officials said a 
gesture that would dramatize the changes taking place in europe 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater stuck with bush on the 
belknap issued a statement from the cruiser saying the president 
thought the talks had been extremely productive 
gorbachev seemed unperturbed by the foul weather and scrambled 
schedule escorted his wife raisa on a tour of the maxim gorky 
the gorbachevs spent several minutes in a shipboard ballroom and 
then poked their heads into the adjacent library 
outside three wind surfers showed off by darting around the bay 
while bush was stranded 
a printed us statement said bush opened the morning meeting 
with an hourlong presentation proposing more than a dozen ideas 
for economic and political progress in ussoviet relations 
it said the talks ranged from the economic situation in eastern 
europe to arms control and central america and added that 
gorbachev spoke at length about perestroika his program of 
economic restructuring and the goals of his reform program 
the meetings were sparked by a spirit of forwardlooking 
cooperation during these increasingly charged times said the 
white house statement 
they recognized that economic and political challenges were 
ahead for eastern europe and vowed to consider the opportunities 
presented with sensitivity and firm initiative 
the first thing to do is eliminate those types of ships which 
you cannot board in this kind of weather gorbachev joked to bush 
as he welcomed him aboard 
we will have a secret agenda in this way to disarm the us 
sixth fleet the soviet leader said with a laugh the soviets are 
serious however in pressing the united states to agree to 
reductions in naval forces as part of arms control negotiations and 
to remove nuclear weapons from the mediterranean zone 
bush braved the choppy seas in a small launch to get to the 
soviet liner and then ran into trouble when he returned to his 
command ship the cruiser uss belknap also anchored about 500 
yards from land 
his launch had to make four passes at the belknap before he 
could board 
a white house statement later said the obvious the 60 miles 
per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship this evening 
but they have made for a very exciting afternoon sail 
asked by reporters if they would reach any achievements 
gorbachev replied da da yes yes on what he was asked 
mnogovo which was translated as meaning a lot of things 
asked the same question the president echoed gorbachev 
mnogovo he said 
the two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a librarylike 
room known as the card room next to the ships lounge and 
nightclub on the maxim gorkys promenade deck 
they sat in deep captains chairs accompanied by aides on 
either side 
bush who had spent the night on the stormbuffeted belknap 
said he had not been bothered by the rough weather piece of 
cake he said 
bush and gorbachev began with an expanded meeting that included 
at least 16 people and then held a oneonone session with note 
takers that lasted about 1 hours that was followed by a working 
lunch after which bush returned to the belknap

a londonbound pan american world airways 747 
with 133 people aboard lost cabin pressure at 37000 feet and dived 
for several minutes before returning safely to los angeles 
officials said 
the decompression of flight 120 friday afternoon began with a 
bang and was followed by a cold rush of air and automatic 
deployment of oxygen masks passengers said no one was injured and 
the cause was not immediately known 
we were very scared said jane hinckley a tourist from new 
zealand we went down so fast that we were pressed back flat 
against out seats we could hear the wind rushing and it suddenly 
got freezing cold 
the pilot whose name was withheld by the airline followed 
standard emergency procedures by diving to a lower altitude where 
the crew and passengers could breathe without oxygen masks 
the federal aviation administration and the airline were 
investigating said an faa regional officer who declined to give 
his name 
the airliner left los angeles international airport shortly 
after noon friday and was heading east at an announced cruising 
altitude of 37000 feet when it lost pressure passengers said 
the scariest thing was that we were dropping for three or four 
minutes and they never told us that we were going to level off 
said jal haemel a member of the us international sailing team on 
his way to a competition in the soviet union 
the jumbo jet eventually leveled off and the pilot informed 
passengers they would be returning to los angeles passengers were 
offered spots on a later flight friday night

president bush appealed to soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev during their summit talks saturday to 
halt the flow of soviet weapons to rebels in el salvador but us 
officials said the issue was not resolved 
gorbachev according to the officials said he did not know how 
the arms get to the central american country 
the united states alleges that the weapons including soviet 
antiaircraft launchers are channeled through the leftist 
governments of cuba and nicaragua a plane that crashed last 
weekend in el salvador carried a cache of soviet weapons the state 
department charged 
us officials at the summit declining to be identified called 
the dispute the biggest stumbling block to a further improvement in 
superpower relations 
secretary of state james a baker last week denounced the 
weapons flow as a relic of the cold war 
he had taken the issue up in september with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze in jackson hole wyo the soviets 
promised at that time to stop direct deliveries and to try to stem 
the flow us officials said 
the salavadoran rebels are using the arms in their war against a 
usbacked rightwing government 
the bush administration meanwhile refuses to stop providing 
weapons to rebels fighting a marxist government in afghanistan the 
state department has ruled out a tradeoff with moscow halting 
soviet arms for salvadoran rebels and us arms to the afghans

the search for a commuter plane that 
disappeared off rhode island last week was delayed at least 20 
minutes until somebody at the westerly airport noticed it was late 
a newspaper reported saturday 
eight people were aboard when the plane presumably crashed into 
block island sound while flying the 17 miles from the island to 
westerly on tuesday the coast guard gave up searching for 
survivors wednesday night after finding debris and two dead dogs 
from the plane 
national transportation safety board officials said 
investigators had not recovered the plane but were compiling 
various evidence including records showing the aircraft underwent 
extensive repairs for a crack three years ago 
officials planned to use sonar monday to scan the ocean floor 
for debris new england airlines president william bendokas told 
the providence journalbulletin the search was delayed because 
ticket agents at westerly did not realize the flight had not 
arrived until 7 pm when they called him at home and said it was 
20 minutes overdue 
the pilots commonly fuel and unload planes before checking in 
with the terminal desk he said bendokas said he called the 
federal aviation administration at 715 pm alhough robert a 
ferreira manager of the faa center at quonset point said his logs 
show the call coming in at 735 pm 
faa records from the agencys oklahoma city office indicate the 
airplane underwent repairs for a crack on july 1 1986 seventeen 
separate steps were taken to fix the hole said faa spokeswoman 
linda whitfield 
the company was doing more maintenance than required by the 
manufacturer on the 1969 model brittennorman islander said ntsb 
spokesman alan pollock in washington 
pollock said an examination of a dog that was accompanying one 
of the missing passengers indicated the animal drowned he would 
not speculate whether that meant the airplane broke up when it hit 
the water 
seas were 5 to 6 feet and water temperatures about 45 degrees 
making survival unlikely for anyone in the water 
the plane was not tracked on air traffic control radar and there 
were no radio calls for help before the crash ntsb spokesman ted 
lopatkiewicz said 
since older commuter planes normally dont carry the black 
box flight recorders that are on larger commercial airliners the 
ntsb said investigators were piecing together other evidence 
including the pilots background 
pilot john beck jr 46 had flown parttime for the airline for 
about six months bendokas said beck previously flew for the navy 
and for about 10 years with area charter operations he said

soviet spokesmen expressed 
satisfaction saturday after five hours of talks in which mikhail s 
gorbachev and president bush advocated a quicker timetable for 
completion of nuclear and conventional arms treaties next year and 
edged toward a chemical arms deal 
things went well gorbachevs spokesman gennady gerasimov 
told reporters who waited in vain aboard the soviet passenger liner 
maksim gorky for an afternoon session bush was forced to postpone 
the meeting and a dinner because gale force winds prevented him 
from leaving the uss belknap anchored a few hundreds yards 
offshore from the gorky which was tied ashore 
they talked about everything arms europe philosophical 
questions gerasimov said of the morning and luncheon talks 
bush suggested that the two men meet again in the united states 
in the last two weeks of june said a white house offical who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
and the us president reiterated his commitment which is 
shared by gorbachev that they should use the occasion to sign a 
treaty to slash superpower strategic nuclear aresenals by 30 to 50 
percent to 6000 warheads apiece 
gorbachev planned to brief his warsaw pact allies monday in 
moscow on the summit said soviet officials but it was unclear 
whether problems with the weather here would delay that meeting 
for the first time a noncommunist polish prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki likely will sit around the table with warsaw 
pact leaders 
gorbachev was pressing bush for greater speed on the strategic 
arms treaty said vitaly churkin a spokesman for soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
gorbachev also wanted a commitment from bush to attend a 
proposed 35nation summit of european and north american leaders in 
late 1990 to sign a pact now under negotiation to remove 30000 
us and 325000 soviet troops from central europe 
the white house spokesmen said that bush had proposed completing 
the deal and signing it at a summit of the 23 nato and warsaw pact 
alliance members at a summit in vienna austria last next year 
gorbachev also appeared successful in prodding bush toward an 
agreement to curb or eliminate us and soviet chemical weapons 
bush proposed at the united nations in september that the 
superpowers cut their chemical arms by 80 percent but the united 
states would continue to produce a new generation of chemical 
weapons 
the bilateral treaty would be intended to build momentum for a 
40nation accord to eliminate chemical weapons over 10 years bush 
said that the united states would destroy all its chemical arms by 
that deadline if all chemicalcapable nations did likewise and 
signed the accord but administation officials that american would 
retain 2 percent of its stockpiles through the 10th year 
the white house official said bush now was willing to drop the 
idea of continuing chemical weapons production and that the united 
states would stop making a new generation of chemical weapons as 
soon as a multilateral agreement to ban such weapons take effect 
the leaders also agreed to schedule two or three arms control 
meetings between between secretary of state james a baker iii and 
shevardnadze the first in the soviet union in january and the next 
at a multinational meeting in ottawa in february 
a soviet media commentator vladimir posner said it was 
possible that the summit would stretch into late sunday to cope 
with the interruption saturday but stressed he was not speaking 
for the kremlin 
such a delay might force postponement of the planned meeting in 
moscow of warsaw pact leaders convening amid sweeping changes in 
eastern europe that the soviet officials said would require a 
restructuring of the sovietled military alliance which was formed 
in 1955 in response to the creation of nato 
in the past gorbachev and other soviet leaders have met with 
the communist party leaders of the six warsaw pact members but the 
dissolution of the hungarian party and the creation of a 
solidarityled government in poland has complicated the process 
said the officials 
it is now up to the countries to decide who to send to 
moscow said a soviet official it will be the bosses as 
usual 
poland for example is likely to send president wojciech 
jaruzelski a former communist party leader and mazowiecki the 
solidarity official who last august formed the first noncommunist 
government in the soviet bloc the communists retain control of the 
defense and internal security minstries 
the reorganization of the alliance however will not be settled 
monday 
its a hot period now we need to wait until the situation 
sorts itself out in these countries said one official 
the future of the blocs must be discussed by bush and 
gorbachev said the official who minimized talk of a reunified 
germany along the lines proposed last week by german chancellor 
helmut kohl 
they should work on the basis of two germanies for the 
foreseeable future said the official that means as long as 
you can see 
bush has said he will not negotiate the future of eastern europe 
with gorbachev

the opposition made strong gains in the 
islands first multiparty elections and handed the ruling 
nationalist party an embarrassing defeat in the hometown of 
taiwans president according to election results sunday 
ballotrigging and noisy protests marred saturdays election 
the first national vote since the nationalist party lifted martial 
law in 1987 the nationalists have been in power since they fled to 
taiwan following their 1949 defeat by the communists in chinas 
civil war 
thousands of angry opposition supporters surrounded government 
office buildings in several cities saturday calling for recounts 
or demanding results protesters broke windows in one city 
the opposition democratic progressive party claimed a great 
victory with nearly all districts reporting the nationalists 
were garnering 55 percent of the popular vote while the opposition 
won about 35 percent the rest went to independents 
this is a setback for the nationalists said ting tinyu a 
professor of sociology they should have won 70 percent of the 
vote 
in 1986 elections the opposition won 22 percent of the vote 
campaigning as independents 
in the legislature the opposition won 21 seats it previously 
held 12 the nationalists won 72 seats 
in county and mayoral races the opposition won six posts up 
from two before the vote the nationalists won 14 one seat went to 
an independent allied with the opposition 
an opposition faction that ran on an illegal campaign platform 
calling for an end to taiwans claim on the communist mainland also 
polled well 
in a slap in the face to the nationalists opposition candidate 
you ching a 47yearold legislator won the executive post in 
taipei county president lee tenghuis hometown the president is 
a symbol of nationalist power 
one of the first things i will do is demolish the nationalist 
party headquarters you told a screaming crowd early sunday 
then you will be able to walk your dogs on the property 
tens of thousands of revelers celebrated yous victory in what 
the local press had dubbed the war of the century supporters 
set off firecrackers and danced in the streets near yous campaign 
headquarters in panchiao 
in all 722 candidates ran in the legislative mayoral and 
county executive races 
the nationalists cannot lose power in the election the 256seat 
legislature and the electoral college are dominated by elderly 
nationalists elected for life on the chinese mainland in the late 
1940s and frozen in office to support the partys claim to be the 
legitimate government of all china 
still the vote is of tremendous importance to this 
highlyindustrialized island of 20 million considered an economic 
miracle in asia 
it is the first nationwide election since 38 years of martial 
law ended in 1987 and the first with a legal opposition it is also 
the first to witness relatively open debate on taboo subjects such 
as taiwan independence and official corruption 
at least 20 of 32 candidates of the opposition new country 
alliance won seats in a variety of races one member the widow of 
a dissident who committed suicide to avoid prosecution for his 
beliefs got one of highest vote tallies in the election another 
woman whose husband has been jailed on political charges also won 
even those who chose nationalists had a preference for change 
two crusading reformers from the liberal wing of the party 
polled the highest in southern and northern taiwan 
reports of votebuying were widespread several voters in taipei 
on saturday told the associated press they had been paid for their 
votes the going rate was 19 
earlier saturday the central election commission said it was 
investigating scores of reports of voter intimidation and ballot 
rigging

in central taiwan and tainan in the south alleging that the 
nationalist party had cheated at the polls in tainan a rowdy 
crowd smashed windows at the government offices and beat government 
officials the staterun radio said 
protests also broke out in taichung in central taiwan but 
police said crowds dispersed sunday 
the oppositions campaign focused on the local rather than 
legislative elections 
we cannot control the legislature but we can rule the local 
governments said democratic progressive party secretarygeneral

as leaders of the american medical association 
prepare to meet to set policy on us healthcare issues some 
members are questioning how well the group is running itself after 
recent revelations about moneylosing deals 
the ama is coping with a controversy involving an executives 
pension losses in a highrisk stock market fund and a loan to 
another executive who defaulted 
the disclosures have shaken the conservative image of the 
chicagobased ama which with 300000 members is the nations 
largest organization for doctors 
its a huge embarrassment to us to the profession and to the 
organization said one east coast doctor and ama member who spoke 
on condition of anonymity we are concerned about our image 
because so much of medicine is based on trust 
a resolution calling for the amas top executive to step aside 
during an investigation is expected to go this week to the groups 
house of delegates the policysetting body is meeting in honolulu 
sunday through wednesday to consider a host of other issues as 
well including patients rights and funding for aids care 
last month four ama affiliates passed resolutions concerning 
revelations that executive vice president dr james h sammons had 
approved two moneylosing deals for other top association 
executives 
making the matter even more painful doctors say is that 
sammons is widely admired within the association as an eloquent and 
effective spokesman and has been credited with saving the ama from 
financial disaster when he took the job in 1974 
the amas board of trustees after receiving a report from the 
law firm doing the investigation issued its own report saturday 
concluding sammons had acted within the scope of his authority 
the report which will go to delegates for ratification this 
week also said the board will restructure its committees and hire 
a new outside auditing firm to try to provide the type of 
accountability sought in the affiliates resolutions the trustees 
declined to comment on the report 
in 1987 sammons approved a 353000 reimbursement to chief 
operating officer whalen m strobhar for losses he suffered in the 
black monday stock market crash sammons said he ordered the 
reimbursement after strohbar reported that his 14 million in 
pension funds was moved by mistake from relatively safe 
moneymarket funds to highrisk but potentially more lucrative 
investments 
two years later sammons reversed his decision after ama 
attorneys said the transfer of funds before the oct 19 1987 
market crash was not a mistake but a deliberate act 
when the deal was reported in a chicago suntimes investigation 
in october strobhar 57 resigned and agreed to repay with 
interest what he acknowledged was an inappropriate 
reimbursement 
in the second deal the ama lost 50000 on a 267000 loan 
sammons approved in may 1985 to help another top executive buy a 
luxury condominium while he was going through a divorce 
ama counsel kirk johnson said there was nothing unusual about 
the loan to richard a noffke 42 then deputy executive vice 
president in charge of real estate and other financial affairs 
but noffke defaulted on the loan forcing the ama to foreclose 
and costing it 50000 several months after the loan noffke lost 
his 187500ayear job in a management reorganization 
the revelations about strobhars stock market loss prompted the 
illinois state medical association to call for the investigation of 
ama financial practices as well as a review of the associations 
administrative structure 
the doctors societies of delaware and the district of columbia 
asked for a curtailment of the broad financial discretion of the 
chief executive 
the washington state medical association said sammons should be 
put on administrative leave until the investigation is closed

the investigation of a san francisco crane 
collapse that killed five people will explore possible criminal 
wrongdoing by a subcontractor for rehiring a crane operator after 
he made nearly catastrophic mistakes a newspaper reported 
saturday 
in oakland meanwhile it was reported that the subcontractor 
had been cited for safety violations four times in the past four 
months 
erection co executives will be questioned about the work and 
medical history of operator lonnie boggess who died in the 
accident hamilton fairburn deputy chief of californias 
occupational safety and health administration told the seattle 
postintelligencer 
any criminal involvement would depend on why they rehired him 
and what evidence they had at that time to feel assured that he was 
ok fairburn said 
newspapers have reported that boggess said in a sworn statement 
last summer in his divorce case that he was upset over a custody 
dispute and made job mistakes that nearly caused catastrophic 
injury to fellow employees 
boggess had tried to commit suicide twice during the past nine 
months and had been hospitalized for psychiatric observation twice 
since march according to court documents obtained by mcclatchy 
newspapers 
there also have been published reports that boggess had a 
history of alcohol problems as well as suggestions that he may 
have suffered a heart attack at the time of the accident 
boggess didnt report for work between april and october 
according to employees of his union 
if the firm laid him off because of his mental state it would 
have to show how he was able to return to work fairburn said 
the cab of the crane made a sudden 180degree turn tuesday while 
the cranes height was being increased from 16 to 20 stories at the 
construction site of a new highrise 
fairburn said investigators are focusing on human error as the 
likely cause of the crane collapse which showered tons of steel on 
the citys busy financial district 
it takes deliberate action to release the dead mans switch 
which locks the crane in place fairburn said investigators still 
havent ruled out a mechanical failure though he added 
the cab along with other parts of the crane has been taken to 
an undisclosed yard where it will be studied by experts 
fairburn said he is aware of published reports that boggess had 
a history of alcohol and drug abuse and has asked the coroner to 
speed a toxicology report coroners officials have said blood 
alcohol test results will be available in about two weeks 
tom hanley of the california osha office in oakland said state 
inspectors have cited erection co four times and fined it 1500 
since aug 4 for work on a 122 million 22story building in that 
city the tribune reported saturday 
the company was cited for not requiring a worker to wear a 
safety belt failing to provide adequate safety platforms for 
workers failing to post safety rules at the site and carrying out 
hazardous crane operations by lifting more than one steel beam at a 
time the first citation came after an ironworker fell 35 feet and 
was injured while welding at the site 
earlier this week the department of labor and industries in 
washington state where erection is based and boggess lived said 
the subcontractor had been cited 20 times for safety violations in 
the past three years including once for a fatal accident and four 
times for accidents involving injuries 
washington regulators have fined the company 117610 since the 
beginning of 1987 but erection is appealing six cases representing 
99770 of the fines

an affluent accountant whose wife was 
strangled last week was ordered to cooperate in the murder 
investigation by giving fingernail scrapings blood and hair 
samples to authorities 
the order friday by cabell county circuit judge dan ohanlon 
came several hours before a land company sued lyle b mcginnis jr 
42 charging he swindled the company out of more than 564 million 
since 1980 and set a fire in his office to destroy the evidence 
nighbert land co of maryland which handles coal leases in 
mingo county alleged that mcginnis also took 649000 from a 
corporate stock account he established for nighbert 
kathy mcginnis was found dead behind a st albans shopping 
center wednesday afternoon 15 hours after apparently being 
strangled at her home in huntington police did not find lyle 
mcginnis until 36 hours later when he was involved in a singlecar 
accident in eastern kentucky 
mcginnis did not return telephone calls left at his house or at 
his parents home friday cabell county sheriff ottie adkins said 
mcginnis has refused to talk to officers on the advice of his 
attorney 
police visited mcginnis in an ashland ky hospital after the 
accident to question him about his wifes slaying but allowed him 
to be released when he wouldnt answer questions 
his attorney was down there last night but he didnt want to 
make any comment adkins said friday 
the sheriff wouldnt say whether mcginnis was a suspect state 
police and sheriffs officials from west virginia and kentucky 
pored over mcginnis car friday to look for evidence 
nighberts attorney michael j farrell said mcginnis purchased 
an interest in the land company in 1979 or 1980 and was named its 
accountant in early 1980 beginning that same year he allegedly 
diverted money to himself his business or a joint account with his 
wife farrell said 
in addition the lawsuit said mcginnis failed to pay nighberts 
taxes since 1980 prompting federal officials to seize the 
companys assets internal revenue service agents were to look over 
the records aug 22 but the documents were lost in an aug 20 fire 
at mcginnis office 
mcginnis caused a fire to be set for the purpose of destroying 
nighbert records the lawsuit said 
the lawsuit seeks the return of 5 million and punitive damages 
of 10 million it also seeks any additional money that might be 
found and asks that mcginnis be forced to pay any federal or state 
penalties 
nighbert fired mcginnis in october farrell said 
nighbert obtained an injunction prohibiting mcginnis from 
disposing of any of his assets which farrell said included a jet 
and several cars court records show mcginnis in june 1986 paid 
495500 for an elaborate home just east of huntington and held 
other property in the county 
in the august fire mcginnis said robbers broke into his office 
tied him to a chair and set a fire there were signs of a scuffle 
but police did not close the books on that case

this dallas suburbs city council changed 
its mind and agreed to seek a sister city in the soviet union even 
though many residents made it clear they consider the cold war far 
from over 
council members voted 52 to endorse a program that will provide 
for student cultural and business exchanges with a soviet city to 
be determined later according to the dallas morning news 
i think the city council should be proud of themselves bob 
weidman president of the plano soviet sister city program inc 
said after fridays vote they came through and in my estimate 
did what was right 
nevertheless most of the more than 40 people who spoke on the 
issue before the council vote opposed the plan 
ray williams said he still believes communists are out to 
dominate the world despite the recent liberalization sweeping 
across eastern europe 
this is part of the most massive propaganda campaign which we 
swallow hook line and sinker williams said if plano becomes 
part of this program we are approving of the communist government 
by adding the city of plano stamp of approval 
councilman mike teague who opposed the measure said there has 
been too much sacrifice and too much loss to just forgive and 
forget 
im about as excited as anybody else about the berlin wall 
but whats been torn down can be built back up 
the council had rejected a similar proposal seven months ago 
several members who changed their minds said they were influenced 
by the national league of cities meeting last week in atlanta 
the preservation of the human spirit was stressed at the 
conference and a new spirit needs to be generated councilman 
mike meyer said this is a good chance for us to do that

a correspondent for a spanishlanguage radio 
network who was reporting from el salvador was last heard from 
early last week and a network official said saturday he feared the 
reporter was dead 
salvador valdez had not be in contact with cadena radio centro 
since tuesday said barrett alley president of the dallasbased 
network that provides programming for 26 affiliates in the united 
states 
if a foreign correspondent hasnt filed a story in four full 
days then theres a problem alley said 
the 44yearold reporter was staying at a hotel in san salvador 
but had checked out early tuesday after interviewing top government 
officials including president alfredo cristiani 
alley said valdez called in seven stories and was not heard from 
again 
we believe his last call may have been from somewhere other 
than the hotel said alley who was in los angeles for business 
the news agency has contacted the embassy of el salvador in 
washington and the press officer at the us embassy in el 
salvador but have yet to get any responses said alley 
officials with the embassy of el salvador were not available for 
comment calls to the embassy were not answered 
valdez left for the wartorn central american country nov 25 
after leftist rebels mounted an offensive in the nations capital 
of san salvador 
more than 70000 people have been killed in the conflict between 
leftist guerrillas and the ussupported government the majority 
of them civilians 
gilberto cortez news director for the agency said in a 
telephone interview from dallas he is trying to stay positive about 
his colleagues condition 
valdez had not registered with the us embassy there or with 
military authorities a standard procedure for journalists in 
foreign countries 
he had orders to register and he had all the proper press 
credentials cortez said what i believe is that maybe he got 
involved too deep with the information he is sending us 
cortez said valdez is the operations manager for the agency but 
was sent to cover reaction of the uprising because the agency was 
shortstaffed and valdez has extensive experience as a reporter 
valdez had interviewed a number of government officials 
including defense and health ministers over four days cortez said

in dallas he has worked for the radio network since its inception

the bosombaring models at yves saint laurent and 
the very proper late duchess of windsor had one thing in common 
perfectly coiffed tresses cared for by alexandre de paris 
his hairstyles add zing to styles shown at nearly every major 
fashion show in town from saint laurent to chanel and from 
jeanlouis scherrer to emanuel ungaro 
during the shows alexandre and 20 assistants turn out 
everything from snail chignons to lion locks on hundreds of 
models 
i have to know whats going on in the designers minds said 
alexandre during an interview in his office above the salon on the 
champs elysees i cant just play the matador with hair it has 
to be a logical part of fashion 
known as king of coiffeurs alexandre also performs at royal 
marriages such as princess carolines first big wedding in monaco 
he is on constant call for friends like elizabeth taylor and sophia 
loren 
he admires loren who actually does her own hair almost every 
day 
born louis alexandre raimondi to a family of vintners in the 
riviera seaport of st tropez alexandre started cutting hair in 
1938 when he was 15 working for antoine the cannes hairdresser 
who was known as coco chanels favorite 
alexandre was encouraged by the bushyhaired writer colette a 
neighbor and friend of his grandmother who talked about paris all 
the time i knew i had to go there 
after world war ii he met the begum and the duchess of windsor 
who insisted he come to paris and he transferred his salon 
alexandre kept jean cocteaus wavy gray locks in line the 
artistwriterfilm creator called alexandre the sphinx which 
became the hair stylists logo 
when he met the carita sisters the trio decided to set up shop 
in 1952 on the rue du faubourg sainthonore not far from the 
presidential elysees palace 
five years later he branched off and hired a staff of 150 
becoming alexandre de paris in 1980 he moved to the present 
salon 
with outlets throughout the united states and his own salon in 
houston alexandres turnover is about 7 million a year much of 
it from his accessory and cosmetics business 
in november he opened a small luxury accessory shop on the rue 
du faubourg saint honore with francois lesage the master 
embroiderer of haute couture 
the whirlwind of fashion shows royal weddings and openings are 
all taken in stride but some events are more memorable such as a 
wedding in 1951 in venice where he made a real splash 
id done princess ira von furstenburgs hair for her wedding 
and was walking the gangplank from the gondola to attend the 
ceremony he recalled suddenly i tripped and fell in the 
venice canal like a piece of lead 
alexandre spends much of his free time with his two children 
neither in the hair business and five grandchildren often 
spending holidays with them at his villa in st tropez 
but his obsession remains with tresses and he loves to give 
advice long hair is for young girls or women who can afford to 
have their hair done every day he said most women should wear 
something more modern easier to care for 
as for older women letting their hair go gray alexandre doesnt 
think much of it unless the woman has a lovely silvery sheen or a 
snowy white color as my grandmother did 
though alexandre is coiffeur to the stars he also finds time 
for ordinary customers provided they reserve well in advance 
a cut and restyling at the salon costs 35 dollars inexpensive 
by paris standards the price for styling by the master himself is 
higher and is set according to the client 
ive done the job so well on a few that their own husbands 
didnt recognize them he said

the energy department said friday it was 
resuming commercial sale of a key component of nuclear warheads 
after concluding that amounts listed as missing hadnt been stolen 
after all 
the material tritium has been sold for 25 years in small 
amounts for research and for making glowinthedark markings as 
for clock faces exit signs and airport runway markings in remote 
areas 
it is also used to boost the power of nuclear warheads and the 
power thermonuclear weapons 
twice this year the department suspended commercial shipments 
from the oak ridge national laboratory in tennessee the first time 
followed complaints of customers that they had not received as much 
as 40 percent of the material they were billed for the second 
time in october followed the loss of a substantial fraction from 
a trial shipment designed to test handling procedures 
the departments announcement late friday of the resumption of 
shipments said four investigations of the tritium shipping 
discrepancies have found no evidence to support the possibility of 
theft or diversion among the causes of the discrepancies were 
deficiencies in equipment measurement methods procedures records 
and management and technical oversight as well as the unique 
properties of tritium 
department spokesman phil keif said he was unable to assign a 
percentage of the 5 grams listed as missing from commercial 
shipments to the reasons given but we think it is explainable 
by those reasons 
we dont think tritium was stolen keif said 
tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen notoriously difficult 
to confine in piping and containers officials said in october they 
believed undetected leaks could be one cause of the missing 
material 
the department said it had revised its measurement techniques 
and saw no need to revise its handling regulations 
the nations tritium production and inventories are secret but 
there have been estimates that only about 4 grams is needed for a 
plutoniumpowered warhead

investigators want to know why the dead 
mans switch failed on a crane letting tons of steel pour down 
on a busy street and killing five people a state official said 
friday 
the brakes on the crane are its dead mans switch said 
hamilton fairburn deputy chief of the state occupational safety 
and health administration it takes energy to release brakes 
the cranes cab made a sudden 180 degree turn tuesday as the 
cranes height was being increased from 16 to 20 stories at the 
construction site of a new highrise 
there have been published reports that the cranes operator who 
was among those killed had a history of alcohol problems and also 
suggestions that he may have suffered a heart attack 
the crane is being studied by experts but fairburn said going 
over the wreckage would not be a quick job 
the crane capable of lifting 177 tons had to be perfectly 
balanced during the repositioning operation according to gordon 
marks a vice president with swinerton amp walberg co the general 
contractor for the project 
despite the necessary balancing both fairburn and company 
officials agreed that repositioning a crane is not considered 
dangerous 
no one in our firm has ever seen or heard of an incident where 
a crane collapsed while being raised from one position to 
another said ned gates the firms chairman 
historically its a very safe operation said fairburn 
both government and company investigators are trying to find out 
why the cab suddenly went out of control 
the cranes deadman arrangement isnt like it is on a 
motorcycle said the investigator there its the throttle 
you let go it shuts off with brakes that are locked in place you 
have to take deliberate action 
he said investigators must find out whether it was released by 
the operator or if there was some malfunction 
right now he said the probe is focusing on human error 
fairburn said he is aware of published reports that crane 
operator lonnie boggess had a history that included alcohol and 
drug abuse 
we have expanded our investigation to look into that and have 
asked the coroner to speed the toxicology report the alcohol 
concerns me because of the psychological and physiological problems 
associated with it he said 
coroners officials have said blood alcohol test results will be 
available in about two weeks 
there also has been speculation that boggess may have suffered a 
heart attack 
boggess sister genoa hefke said she spoke with a worker who 
was on the ground and in radio contact with boggess before the 
accident 
she said the worker told her that the radio suddenly went silent 
and that boggess 45 may have had a heart attack 
all of a sudden he stopped answering and then it started 
rocking back and forth she said 
but said fairburn a heart attack wouldnt account for the cab 
suddenly going out of control 
even if he had a heart attack and slumped forward it is 
relatively safe because the brakes are locked up they have guards 
on them so you cant slump over them again it would take 
deliberate action to release them

a congressional committee ignored 
government appeals friday and approved a bill to have voters decide 
if suspected drug traffickers should be extradited to the united 
states for prosecution 
telling the committee members not to make themselves 
accomplices of drug traffickers interior minister carlos lemos 
simmonds said approval of the measure would increase drugrelated 
violence 
he also suggested drug traffickers were responsible for the 
crash of a colombian jetliner monday all 107 passengers and crew 
were killed 
if adopted by congress and signed by president virgilio barco 
the bill would provide for a referendum to determine if the 
extradition of colombian drug suspects should continue 
the barco administration has sent nine suspected traffickers to 
the united states since it reinstituted extradition on aug 18 as 
part of an antidrug fight following the assassination of a 
presidential candidate drug traffickers were blamed for the 
killing 
lemos simmonds called the proposed bill monstrous and 
shameful he said a referendum would lead to a national 
bloodbath as drug traffickers would step up violence to intimidate 
citizens into rejecting extradition 
you are inviting colombians not to a referendum but to the 
slaughterhouse because the election will provoke tremendous 
violence deaths and intimidation he said 
he also said he feared more druglinked violence before the 
presidential elections in may 1990 
dont dirty colombia the minister told the 35member 
committee dont become the accomplices of drug traffickers 
the committee voted 2411 in favor of attaching the referendum 
bill to legislation to amend the constitution the house of 
representatives is scheduled to vote on the legislation monday 
the senate then will have to ratify the referendum lemos 
simmonds said he would ask barco not to sign the measure 
some members of the committee objected to the ministers 
suggestion they were pandering to drug traffickers several said 
the public had a right to decide if extradition should continue 
amid a wave of terrorist violence 
authorities have blamed drug traffickers for some 200 bombings 
that have killed 29 people and injured 238 across colombia in less 
than four months 
lemos simmonds citing examples of violence by drug traffickers 
spoke of planes that dont finish their journeys because they are 
blown up 
drug smugglers bring down aircraft he added 
he was referring to the avianca airlines boeing 727 that 
exploded minutes after taking off from bogotas international 
airport monday on its way to the southern city of cali 
lemos simmonds told caracol radio later that he based his 
statements on claims of responsibility for the jetliner crash by 
the extraditables a terrorist group linked to the medellin cocaine 
cartel 
a man saying he represented the group told caracol it blew up 
the plane in retaliation for a police raid on the hideout of pablo 
escobar a leader of the medellin cartel on nov 22 
caracol later said it doubted the calls authenticity 
government investigators said they have not determined the cause 
of the crash but it could have been from an explosive device

nearly 200000 aids cases have been reported 
worldwide to the world health organization the un agency said 
friday in a report published to coincide with world aids day 
the who report covers only people diagnosed as having the 
disease the number of notified cases seriously underestimates the 
true extent of the problem as many cases especially in africa go 
unreported the who report also does not include people infected by 
the hiv virus who have not developed the disease itself 
who headquarters in geneva were draped on friday with patchwork 
quilts bearing names and mementos of aids victims including baby 
jessica as a poignant reminder of the global tragedy 
who said in its aids update that 11000 new victims of the 
deadly disease acquired immune deficiency syndrome were 
registered by the end of last month bringing the total number of 
cases to 198165 
the united states reported 3025 of the new cases raising its 
midnovember total to 110333 about 56 percent of the world total 
the united states has recorded 18043 new victims so far this year 
according to the who report 
updated figures from france brought the total of cases there to 
8025 the second highest behind the united states brazil has 
reported 7787 cases and uganda which has not revised its 
statistics since april 7375 cases 
bermuda with 122 notified cases has the highest rate of the 
disease with 491 cases per 100000 people another popular 
holiday resort the bahamas follows with 380 cases per 100000 
the rate in the united states is 120 per 100000 
who said that kuwait the tiny comoro islands republic off east 
africa and san marino in europe reported their first case of aids 
jonathan mann director of whos aids program said that during 
the 1980s full blown cases of aids are believed to have numbered 
600000 and of those some 300000 were thought to have died he 
said more than 5 million people became infected with the hiv virus 
the world health organization predicts that by the year 2000 
6 million aids cases may have occurred if hiv spread accelerates 
especially in asia these estimates will be too conservative he 
told his audience in geneva 
aids is a disease in which a virus attacks the bodys immune 
system leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections 
and cancers it is most often transmitted through sexual contact 
other means include sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or 
syringes by drug abusers and transfusions of tainted blood or blood 
products aids can also be passed from mother to child at or before 
birth 
at a ceremony to mark the second world aids day at whos 
headquarters its directorgeneral dr hiroshi nakajima appointed 
princess chulabhorn of thailand as whos goodwill ambassador for 
the next two years 
chulabhorn who holds a doctorate in organic chemistry said she 
saw as her main task promoting whos health objectives among heads 
of state throughout the world 
the daylong event which focused on young people included panel 
discussions workshops with local schoolchildren and release of two 
new films on aids 
brightly colored quilts hung on the walls of the who building 
baby jessica was embroidered among pictures of teddy bears 
on one large piece of patchwork a huge patchwork map of africa

the american civil liberties union on friday 
decried a county sheriffs policy that forces homosexual jail 
inmates to wear pink bracelets 
it reflects homophobia said jim green an aclu attorney in 
west palm beach labeling peoples clothing based on a sexual 
preference seems an extreme response to a situation that doesnt 
warrant it 
for at least 15 years homosexual inmates at the polk county 
jail have been kept separate from other inmates and labeled with 
pink wrist bands the sheriff says its for their own safety 
all hell would break loose in the prison if homosexuals were 
allowed to mix with the general population said sheriff lawrence 
w crow jr if this system wasnt needed for their own 
protection id change it in a minute 
crow said homosexual inmates are often the targets of ridicule 
and beatings so jailers ask all inmates their sexual preference 
when they enter the facility 
if the inmate says he is homosexual he is given a wrist band 
and kept separate from the general population said sheriffs 
spokeswoman lynne breidenbach if we find out things later and 
have probable cause that hes a homosexual then we put the wrist 
band on 
ms breidenbach said different colored bands are used to 
distinguish inmates for other reasons such as green for 
escaperisk inmates she said there was no special reason pink was 
chosen to distinguish homosexuals 
its really an offred she said thats just the color 
that was available 
the county jail has 1199 inmates of which 25 to 35 are wearing 
bracelets identifying them as homosexuals breidenbach said 
aclu attorney green said he is studying possible civil action to 
have the practice stopped as unconstitutional he cited a case in 
indiana two years ago in which a federal court ruled against 
segregation of homosexual inmates 
kirk warren the sheriffs legal counsel said thursday the 
practice of labeling inmates is legal and in the best interest of 
the safety of all the inmates 
the sheriff while not acknowledging complaints from inmates or 
the aclu said he has been looking into switching the colored bands 
to bands that have bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets 
waving a scanner over the bracelets would tell staff members 
whether inmates have medical problems or are wanted in another 
county according to crow who said no immediate plans have been 
made to switch to the system 
while bands with bar codes would be an improvement theyre not 
a solution aclu officials said 
robyn blumner executive director for floridas aclu described 
the bar codes as more palatable than pink tags but she 
maintained that sexual orientation shouldnt have anything to do 
with inmate classifications 
predator inmates should be separated from victim inmates but 
sexual preference should have nothing to do with it she said 
gays who seek protection from others should be granted it 
blumner said but only at their choice not the sheriffs 
blumner said six lesbian inmates have written to her with 
complaints that being pink tagged has limited their privileges 
and brought harsh treatment from corrections officers 
crow denies the charges

investigators hope to make a map of two 
cemeteries where it is believed thousands of bodies might have been 
buried in already occupied graves a state official said friday 
attorney general fred cowans consumer protection division 
launched an investigation of the cemeteries in may after a tip from 
a gravedigger that old burial lots were being reused 
investigators have since unearthed old headstones at the eastern 
cemetery near downtown and at greenwood cemetery on the citys 
west side and have speculated that many old graves were not marked 
properly if at all the cemeteries are thought to contain about 
81000 bodies 
both cemeteries probably were full by the turn of the century 
said phil diblasi a university of louisville archaeologist 
the burial grounds are owned by louisville crematory and 
cemeteries inc founded in 1854 the corporation and three of its 
officers were charged with 60 criminal counts including theft 
corpse abuse and grave desecration 
burials in reserved graves have continued at both cemeteries 
since the investigation began cowan said 
investigators cannot provide any individual consumer with 
specific assurances about their particular family member who may be 
buried there cowan said im very sorry to say that but 
thats simply a fact of life

that the soviet ambassador here ordered the nicaraguan and cuban 
governments at a secret meeting in managua to stop shipping weapons 
to leftist rebels in el salvador 
the french newspaper le monde on wednesday quoted an 
unidentified leader of nicaraguas leftist sandinista government as 
its source

salvadoran rebels 
we have spoken with our ambassador and he utterly denies 
having made statements in this sense said igor rybalkin of the 
international department of the soviet communist partys 
policymaking central committee 
besides because of the very principle of our relations with 
countries like cuba like nicaragua this is excluded 
president daniel ortega of nicaragua has not denied the 
salvadoran accusation 
rybalkin said his government was concerned about the situation 
in central america and the regions conflicts will probably be 
discussed at the weekend summit between presidents bush and mikhail 
s gorbachev 
he said that althouth the agenda was open for the gorbachevbush 
summit its very possible and im even sure that the central 
american conflict is going to figure in their discussions

chancellor helmut kohl assured 
visiting us senators on the eve of a superpower summit that west 
germany will not forsake nato to reunite with east germany one of 
the senators said friday 
he strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified 
germany be neutral sen richard g lugar head of the american 
delegation said of the friday meeting with kohl 
asked whether he thought the west germans were committed to 
staying in the nato military alliance of western nations the 
indiana republican said without any reservations 
there is growing discussion in west germany about german 
reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms 
underway in east germany there has been speculation that west 
germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the 
kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification 
kohl on tuesday unveiled a 10point proposal with german 
reunification as its ultimate goal but the soviets who suffered 
millions of deaths fighting a unified germany in world war ii have 
said the idea of german reunification is dangerous and 
unrealistic 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are to 
begin a shipboard summit off malta on saturday the dramatic events 
in east germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the east bloc 
are likely to be a main topic of their talks 
lugar came to bonn with eight other members of the us senates 
arms control observer group he said the purpose of the trip was to 
visit with the germans on their judgments about all of these 
procedures that are going on

75minute closeddoor talks with kohl the senators also met with 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense minister 
gerhard stoltenberg during the day

procedure that depends on many events in germany and europe and 
that the soviet union and the united states have a role to play

jurors who turned in one verdict in the 
mcmartin preschool molestation case may be withholding five others 
for fear of disrupting work on dozens of remaining counts the 
judge said friday 
the panelists may be trying to avoid explaining their verdicts 
to friends and work colleagues while on a scheduled twoweek 
vacation that begins dec 16 superior court judge william pounders 
said 
on tuesday jurors handed in one sealed verdict but they may 
have reached a decision on five more of the 65 counts against 
raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey pounders said 
buckey 31 and his mother 63 are charged with molestation and 
conspiracy in connection with the alleged sexual molestation of 11 
students at their nowdefunct familyowned school in manhattan 
beach 
the 2yearold proceeding the nations longest criminal trial 
has cost los angeles county more than 15 million 
meanwhile the judge said he may not read the sealed verdict by 
dec 15 as he had previously considered 
the judge said he is considering sequestering the jury and 
waiting until all the verdicts are in before reading them earlier 
he had indicated he had tentative plans to read the verdicts 
piecemeal 
pounders previously had ordered the jurors to return verdicts as 
they were reached calling it an insane process but a way of 
avoiding a potential mistrial if one of the 12 panelists is unable 
to continue 
no alternates are available and the sealed verdicts become 
legal only when the jurors affirm their decisions in court 
the worst possible situation is to have verdicts that are not 
legally effective and then lose jurors pounders said friday 
however the judge said last month he could find no case law to 
support his plan to accept sealed verdicts one at a time and 
buckeys lawyer danny davis had objected to the procedure 
attorneys were to meet with the judge on monday to discuss when 
the verdicts should be read

veto of a bill to let them remain here after their visas expire 
saying he seems to be exempting china from the human rights 
standards held for other socialist countries 
but several students expressed faith in bushs promise that he 
would help those who fear returning to their homeland through other 
means 
pei min xin a graduate student in government at harvard 
university and a prodemocracy leader said friday that bush caved 
into pressure from china calling the fierce chinese government 
opposition to the bill a bluff 
people like us have come to this country not only to study but 
to learn how democracy operates we have found that this single 
case is rather discouraging pei said when it comes down to a 
choice between human rights and geopolitical interests the leading 
democracy did not hesitate to choose the latter

evidence of the aids epidemic is everywhere 
in this city from the political coalitions formed to battle the 
lethal illness to the millions being spent to care for its victims 
most residents know of someone who has aids the health care 
system is saturated local officials are pleading for federal funds 
and the gay community has rallied as never before 
san francisco has the nations highest percapita incidence of 
aids authorities expect that by the end of the year more than 
24000 residents will have been infected with the virus of 7416 
people reported with fullblown aids 4827 have died 
eight years after aids began to cut its deadly swath across san 
francisco changes are apparent 
instead of organizing to get government off our backs and out 
of our bedrooms gay activists have launched a powerful movement 
to make government work for them 
we realized that government did have a role to play in our 
lives said ron braithwaite president of the alice b toklas 
lesbian and gay democratic club 
as gay men and lesbians work together on aids they are forging 
an alliance some believe will exert unprecedented influence 
it has made us politically stronger wiser and better 
organized than we have ever been said jean harris an aide to 
board of supervisors president harry britt and chairwoman of the 
gay and lesbian caucus of the california democratic party 
the city has become an international model for lowcost 
patientoriented aids care that relies on an enormous base of 
volunteers but the cost of the epidemic is daunting 
total aids spending this year is estimated at 115 million 
according to mayoral aide susan ehrlich most of the 80 million 
from the private sector will come from private health insurers the 
city will add 76 million and state and federal government will 
provide the rest she said 
and officials expect an additional 30 million will be needed 
when the city formally endorses early care programs for people 
without symptoms 
the citys aids office has 75 employees and a budget this year 
of 25 million including state and federal funds to coordinate 
more than 200 different aids organizations and service providers 
when it was established in 1983 the office had one director a 
secretary and 150000 
at san francisco general hospital aids care will cost between 
15 million and 20 million this year executive director phil sowa 
said the 20 beds designated for aids patients are always full and 
20 overflow patients are hospitalized in different wards he said 
a crisis looms in the citys inability to provide sufficient 
posthospital care at skilled nursing facilities and boardandcare 
homes he said 
many speak of the talent drain as the city loses so many 
people in their prime the impact can be devastating 
who wouldve thought id be reading the obits at 40 every 
day said scott smith former lover and business partner of 
harvey milk the citys first openly gay supervisor who was slain 
in 1978 along with mayor george moscone 
smith said he cant bear to replace his outdated address book 
and leave out all the names that wouldnt move into the new one 
aids also has politicized a new generation of activists who 
scrutinize anything having to do with the disease 
organizations like stop aids now or else have staged 
controversial protests like blockading the golden gate bridge and 
disrupting the glittery opening night of the opera season to call 
attention to demands for faster action on drug testing and 
increased financing for aids care and research 
i think aids is one of the new exciting things to be radical 
about said eric rofes executive director of the shanti project 
a volunteerbased aids agency that serves 1200 a month 
in the gay community aids prevention and education remain a top 
priority 
some credit aids with triggering a trend toward longterm 
committed relationships between gay men while others say the 
health crisis simply speeded up a process that began before aids 
i believe that without aids the picture would look very 
similar in terms of more coupling and more adopted children 
said rofes 
public health experts worry that their greatest challenge in the 
gay community now is keeping the safe sex message alive 
researchers have noted a slight increase in the number of gay 
men who are engaging in unsafe sex again despite the high risk 
about half of the gay men in the city are believed to be infected 
with hiv 
having saturated their own community with prevention 
information gays are forming alliances with other highrisk 
groups including intravenous drug users 
fighting aids also has united gay men and lesbians 
although some doubt the durability of the alliance harris 
points to britts domestic partnership legislation as a byproduct 
of the aids epidemic and a signal of future struggles 
the proposal which was narrowly defeated by city voters in 
november would have recognized unions between unmarried livein 
lovers who register with the city and would have extended 
visitation and bereavementleave rights to city workers 
the proposal had strong backing from gays in the age of aids who 
had been denied hospital access to their dying lovers or were 
turned down when requesting time off to attend funerals harris 
said 
large corporations have developed aids education programs and 
provide referrals for employees seeking counseling or other 
services 
but many small businesses cannot get affordable health coverage 
according to scott hauge president of the small business network 
of san francisco who said one company with 200 workers faced 
acrosstheboard rate increases of 125 percent after two employees 
came down with aids 
weve demonstrated that the health care system in this country 
is very fragile and a lot of people are slipping through it said 
braithwaite of the toklas club 
signs of the aids epidemic are everywhere even in the chirp of 
personal electronic timers frequently heard in restaurants and 
movie theaters in predominantly gay neighborhoods theyre 
reminding aids patients to take the antiviral drug azt

is moscow ready for muni bonds 
an american financial consultant is trying to find that out 
jeffrey a sachs has signed an agreement with soviet officials to 
help develop the concept of public bond financing in the soviet 
union 
sachs says his plan is aimed at giving soviet residents a place 
to put their huge savings of rubles and at the same time aid the 
rebuilding of the nations economy 
any bond program would have to overcome intense skepticism on 
the part of the soviet people but sachs believes it is worth a try 
the whole essence of the program is to put the ruble to 
work he said in an interview last week 
sachs 37 runs a consulting firm in new york and used to be 
chief of staff for rep thomas j downey a new york democrat last 
summer he directed government affairs for the moscow peace 
festival a rock concert 
he is not to be confused with the harvard university professor 
of the same name who advises latin american debtor nations and 
polands solidarity movement 
the president of jeffrey a sachs associates inc said he 
developed his contacts with soviet officials while helping set up 
the make a difference foundation concert whose proceeds went to 
programs fighting drug and alcohol abuse 
i realized that in the soviet union public finance is a very 
logical place to begin developing an investment banking system 
everything is government there he said 
he said the soviets were taken with the idea including ones 
from the influential institute of the usa and canada 
in a letter to sachs in september georgy arbatov the 
institutes director and a member of the soviet parliament said 
the biggest concern was the nonconvertibility of the ruble into 
hard western currencies 
to tailor public finance bonds to soviet investors who may not 
be attracted by the prospect of earning more rubles since there is 
little to buy with them sachs proposes that the bonds pay 
interest in the form of foreign currency certificates these 
certificates could be spent in the countrys hardcurrency shops 
sachs also suggested to the soviets that they create a savings 
bond program which would pay interest in rubles rather than hard 
currencies such an issue would need to address concerns about 
inflation and compensate for any devaluations in the ruble sachs 
said in order to attract soviet investors 
these bonds would leverage the vast amounts of rubles soviet 
citizens have salted away and be a good use of the countrys 
scarce hard currency sachs said 
under the protocol of intentions sachs signed last month 
soviet officials including arbatov sachs agreed to assemble a 
group of us economic and investment advisers to help devise a 
demonstration project using a bond issue possibilities under 
consideration include housing a manufacturing plant and a hospital 
sachs said he has had preliminary discussions with several wall 
street firms which he declined to identify he said the protocol 
is the first step in a process that is expected to lead to a 
jointventure agreement with the soviets 
the protocol which also was signed by the deputy chairman of 
the commission on economic reform of the soviet council of 
ministers states that the development of a system of public 
finance in the soviet union is a critical component of economic 
reform 
one expert on the soviet economy was skeptical of sachss 
proposals 
bonds have a bad reputation among the soviet people said 
josef c brada an arizona state university professor 
brada said soviets were soured on bonds by a stalinera bond 
program used to help finance the government everyone had to buy 
these bonds they hated it he said in a telephone interview 
the bonds were repudiated by khrushchev who said the government 
would not make payments on them 
brada said soviets also would question any plan to index a 
bonds return to inflation or currency changes 
people see that real inflation is much higher than what the 
states index shows he said no one is going to believe that 
the indexing is going to be done honestly 
brada believes a better way to improve the soviet economy would 
be to devalue the ruble sharply and make it convertible into 
western currencies

big success has come in small packages for lewis 
galoob toys inc 
its tiny vehicles have been zooming off store shelves micro 
machines have ridden onto toy and hobby world magazines monthly 
lineup of fast sellers all year consistently finishing in the top 
10 places and frequently in the first second or third slots 
david galoob says the company is headed toward being a major 
player in the toy business in the 1990s analysts are impressed 
with its progress so far 
galoob provided an early look at next years toys friday in a 
tour of the companys new york showroom 
miniature has worked for galoob and we believe that it can 
work again the president and chief executive officer said in an 
interview the company is named for his father who founded it more 
than three decades ago and died in 1971 
many of the new toys galoob will roll out next year continue the 
smallsize theme that has helped the company stage a strong 
comeback from a 1987 industrywide slump galoob lost almost 25 
million that year but returned to profitability in 1988 by earning 
more than 6 million 
new models of the thimblesized micro machines will be added to 
the hundreds already available some will have a magnifying lens in 
place of a sun roof so children can peer into the teeny interior 
new playsets are being added to the carwash and service station 
already on the market 
ultrasmall vehicles inside regularsized micro machines will be 
brought out in 1990 a motorized train and track set also will be 
unveiled 
the existing collection which appeals to childrens acquisitive 
instincts includes commonplace and fancy cars from diminutive 
rolls royces to soupedup dodge vans the line also has ambulances 
fire engines trucks boats tanks planes and trains 
one 1990 addition to galoobs miniatures for girls is secret 
places a series of dolls in rooms with furniture and appliances 
that open to reveal even smaller but virtually identical versions 
new offspring of the successful bouncin baby miniature doll line 
will make their debut 
galoob started thinking small in 1987 when consumers soured on 
highpriced hightech toys 
keeping prices down a package of five micro machines can be 
bought for under 10 proved wise over the past two years when so 
much money was being spent on home video games children and their 
parents havent had much left over for other toys after buying 
nintendo games 
we were able to live and compete very well with the video game 
onslaught galoob boasts 
retail analysts say galoob is one of the only companies that has 
kept coming up with creative products despite the competitive 
challenge of video games 
while industry leaders like hasbro inc and mattel inc turned 
to classics like gi joe and barbie galoob has established a new 
category of miniature collectibles in the process micro machines 
have whizzed past mattels hot wheels and universal matchbox group 
ltds matchbox cars to become the most popular collectible vehicle 
line in the world 
the company expects to have 200 million in sales this year up 
from 140 million in 1988 it has managed to do it with less money 
to spend on research and development than its larger competitors 
such as no1 hasbro which analysts estimate will have 15 billion 
in 1989 sales 
it really is a challenge for us to compete with those 
gentlemen that have bigger dollars at their disposal galoob said 
after previewing next years toys analyst paul valentine of 
standard amp poors corp said he upgraded his investment opinion on 
galoob to a strong buy from neutral i was very impressed with 
what they had valentine said 
besides the miniature items one of galoobs 1990 toys is a 
stuffed animal with batterypowered illuminated eyes that small 
children can take to bed as a night light a talking doll that 
moves her lips also is waiting in the wings and will sell for about 
60 
we dont mind getting into higher priced hightech toys we 
just dont want to be dependent on them david galoob said 
how well galoob does outside the miniature category could 
determine whether it can make the transition to a bigtime toy 
company 
analyst walter kirchberger of painewebber group inc said the 
verdict is still out on whether galoob has done enough to diversify 
and protect itself if micro machines fall out of favor micro 
machines will account for more than half of galoobs 1989 business 
which was the case in 1988 as well 
it will be tougher for galoob to impress wall street next year 
because the company will face a much higher tax rate eroding 
aftertax earnings 
for earnings to be up in 1990 sales will have to be up quite 
a bit kirchberger said 
through three quarters of this year galoob has earned about 14 
million up more than threefold from a year earlier while sales 
totaled about 170 million up 80 percent 
eightyfive percent of galoobs manufacturing is done in china 
the company is trying to spread out to other asian nations and was 
planning to rely more on thailand and indonesia even before the 
june uprising in china david galoob said 
growth in the next decade will partly come through acquisitions 
and galoob says the company which is based in south san francisco 
calif has put aside 40 million for the purpose 
in the meantime he expressed confidence about business 
prospects despite weakness in the economy there are always 
children so the toy industry is sort of recessionproof

a judge on friday denied phoenixbased uhaul 
international incs request to order 2500 of a competitors 
biggest trucks off the road 
uhaul had asked judge paul g rosenblatt of us district court 
for a preliminary injunction against ryder system inc claiming 
that miamibased ryder had equipped a fleet of 24foot rental 
trucks with a loading device similar to one uhaul patented jan 
30 1973 the patent expires jan 30 1990 
the patented device uhaul maintained gives its trucks a 
competitive advantage of having lower rear decks making them 
easier for consumers to load and unload 
ryder told the judge it would suffer an 8 million loss in the 
fourth quarter if it had to remove its trucks from the marketplace 
the trucks were introduced in early 1989 
both sides claimed victory friday 
it was very favorable to the uhaul patent said thomas g 
watkins iii an attorney for uhaul 
watkins said rosenblatt refused to issue the injunction largely 
because the damage to ryder by having all 2500 of its 
infringing trucks parked outweighed uhauls need for such a short 
injunction 
we are gratified that the court has so far supported ryders 
position david r parker president of ryder truck rental said 
in a statement 
ryder contends it did not infringe on uhauls patent 
the 2500 trucks which each cost about 30000 represent about 
8 percent of ryders fleet of consumer rental vehicles ryder said 
uhaul on aug 23 filed a patentinfringement suit against 
ryder and on sept 15 filed for the preliminary injunction asking 
that the trucks be taken off the road a trial has yet to be 
scheduled in the case but is expected to go before rosenblatt 
during the first half of 1990

wall street leaders have declared an end 
to their lengthy battle to keep banks out of the stocks and bonds 
business proposing to repeal the law that has governed the 
nations basic banking structure since the depression 
directors of the securities industry association at the trade 
groups annual convention here on friday endorsed a proposal for 
new legislation to let subsidiaries of banks engage in a broad 
range of securities and securitiesrelated activities 
at the same time the sia said its plan would let brokers engage 
in consumer banking businesses and join banks in having access to 
the federal reserves banking system including the right to borrow 
from the fed in emergencies 
the move appears to herald one of the biggest breaks yet in the 
gradually crumbling wall separating banking and brokerage 
activities erected by the glasssteagall act of 1933 amid the 
financial crisis that followed the stock market crash four years 
earlier 
the barrier has been weakened chink by chink in recent years 
with the move toward financial deregulation and court decisions 
permitting banks to make increasing inroads into what had formerly 
been the brokers turf 
for example many banks now participate in new offerings of some 
kinds of securities offer discount stock brokerage and sell shares 
in mutual funds 
brokers for their part have also successfully launched forays 
into businesses once considered the domain of the banks 
in 1977 for example they began to offer central assets 
accounts that are technically not bank deposits but come with 
such features as checkwriting credit cards and lines of credit 
the banking industry itself has used such brokerage services as 
an argument for dismantling glasssteagall and allowing them 
greater authority to enter the securities insurance and real 
estate businesses 
nevertheless brokers have until now consistently sought to hold 
the glasssteagall line arguing that banks would enjoy several 
unfair advantages in any arena of unfettered competition 
they also say banks with their federal deposit insurance and 
links to the federal reserve system should not be allowed to 
expose themselves to risky ventures involving such things as the 
sale of stocks 
sia officials said that banking groups played no part in 
formulating their plan which was made after a lengthy board 
meeting late friday 
hardwick simmons of shearson lehman hutton the outgoing 
chairman of the sia said the securities and exchange commission 
which regulates wall street had been consulted and indicated that 
it applauded the initiative 
the sia said it would be holding talks with the next few weeks 
with the bush administration congress and regulators to work out 
details of what could amount to one of the most sweeping changes in 
basic financial legislation in 56 years 
one widely discussed possible result of any glasssteagall 
reform has been mergers between the biggest banks and brokerage 
firms 
sia did not address such specifics however most observers 
point out that after any merger banking and brokerage activities 
still would have to be conducted by separate subsidiaries of the 
same company because brokers are regulated by the sec while banking 
is regulated by a different set of agencies including the fed 
comptroller of the currency and federal deposit insurance corp 
we think that anything that leads to vastly increased 
financial concentration is not in the broader interests of our 
financial system said ken guenther spokesman for the 
independent bankers association of america which represents 
thousands of community banks 
asked about the lateafternoon development citicorp spokesman 
john maloney in new york said executives at the nations largest 
banking company would want to study the full resolution but he 
added its been a bad month for walls 
outside observers see a variety of possible motives for the 
sias change of strategy 
some believe that influential members of the securities business 
felt it was useless and costly to keep fighting pitched battles a 
good many of which were being lost 
also the proposal comes at a time when brokers are confronted 
with a barrage of other problems including high overhead and 
shrinking profits from many of their traditional activities 
when one prominent wall street figure chairman john gutfreund 
of the investment banking firm salomon brothers inc spoke to the 
convention on thursday he declared 
it is time for all the institutions in the financial services 
industry to find some common ground 
a major mission facing us financial institutions he said is 
to work to design the postglasssteagall world
