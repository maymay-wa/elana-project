west germany we refute them the agency quoted him as saying

president bushs capital gains tax cut which 
won a bitter fight in the house may face trouble in the senate 
because of concerns that it is illtimed and gives too large a tax 
savings to the nations richest people 
the senate has traditionally leaned strongly toward such 
reductions but some senators who have favored capital gains cuts 
in the past find the new proposal unacceptable because of the 
current budget deficit and its tilt to the wealthy 
sen lloyd bentsen chairman of the senate finance committee and 
longtime backer of lower taxes on capital gains said he will 
recommend that a capital gains cut not be included when the 
committee begins work monday on a deficitreduction plan 
bentsen dtexas said friday that an incentive for saving and 
investment is needed but a temporary cut followed by an increased 
rate would destabilize the markets its sheer budget gimmickry 
instead bentsen is proposing that taxdeductible individual 
retirement accounts be made available to more workers to encourage 
saving 
sen bill bradley dnj a member of the committee said the 
panel is likely to reject the capital gains reduction and accept 
the ira alternative 
senate majority leader george j mitchell dmaine said i 
think there is a reasonably good chance well be able to prevail 
in the senate and defeat the capital gains cut 
if that happened taxwriters from the house and senate would 
have to negotiate some kind of compromise that could include both a 
capital gains reduction and liberalized iras 
in a hardfought vote thursday the house accepted a plan 
supported by bush that would reduce capital gains tax rates for 27 
months the maximum rate now 33 percent would be cut to 20 
percent on jan 1 1992 the top rate would be raised to 28 
percent and investments indexed so that profits caused by 
inflation would not be taxed 
there is general agreement that cutting the rates would 
encourage investors to sell assets before the rates rose again 
generating about 94 billion in new revenue over three years 
bentsen insists this yoyo effect would do nothing to encourage 
longterm investment 
but the strongest political point about the capital gains cut is 
that by any reckoning most of the tax saving would go to those 
with the greatest wealth 
sen daniel patrick moynihan dny said the reduction would 
simply be mailing a check for 25000 to every republican 
contributor in the last campaign 
the joint committee on taxation estimates that people with 
incomes above 200000 who report capital gains would get tax cuts 
averaging 24906 apiece 
it is hard for me to understand why this whole discussion has 
to reach the level of rich versus poor treasury secretary 
nicholas brady told a senate finance committee hearing friday 
the rich are getting richer in this country and the poor are 
getting poorer said sen tom daschle dsd youll have to 
forgive us for bringing it up 
the jointcommittee staff which provides tax expertise to the 
house and senate estimates 80 percent of the tax saving from the 
capital gains cut would go to couples and individuals with incomes 
above 100000 a year 
brady contends that figure is misleading because the 
over100000 category includes many people of relatively modest 
earnings who once in a lifetime sell a small business or a home 
and show greater incomes in that one year 
the secretary estimated that 47 percent of capital gains are 
realized by people whose other income not including the gains 
is less than 50000 a year 
but bentsen said the jointcommittee staff found that only 18 
percent of the gains were taken by people who reported just one 
capital gains transaction including sale of a home or business 
a year 
brady also said more than 80 percent of the tax saving from the 
ira expansion proposed by bentsen would go to workers with incomes 
above 50000 a year

house and senate negotiators are telling 
federal arts agencies not to give any money to obscene art but 
theyre backing away from stronger standards proposed by sen jesse 
helms 
under a compromise reached friday the national endowment for 
the arts and national endowment for the humanities would receive 
budgets in the 1990 fiscal year provided they implement new 
standards in giving grants 
the provision is a weakening of a senatepassed measure backed 
by helms rnc that called for banning federal aid for art that 
is obscene or indecent or that denigrates a religion race 
ethnic background age group or handicap 
instead grants would be denied to art that depicts 
sadomasochism homoeroticism the sexual exploitation of children 
or individuals engaged in the sex act 
and borrowing from a supreme court ruling on obscenity the 
conferees said the art works denied funding would have to be 
utterly devoid of significant literary artistic scholarly 
scientific or political value 
the agreement cleared the way for house and senate agreement on 
a bill to provide about 11 billion for federal land and cultural 
programs for the next fiscal year which begins sunday 
the agreement sought to end a controversy over what arts groups 
say is close to censorship helms and his backers said it was a 
matter of whether works considered by many to be obviously 
offensive should be getting taxpayer money 
i dont know if its a victory for anybody said rep sidney 
yates dill the chief house negotiator 
im not fully pleased but its a way of resolving differences 
between the house and senate said sen james mcclure ridaho 
the senate by 6531 voted friday to urge the negotiators to 
adopt the toneddown prohibition on federal assistance 
a day before the senate had rejected helms by a surprisingly 
wide margin voting 6235 against a resolution backing his stand 
helms amendment had been adopted july 26 by voice vote with few 
lawmakers in the chamber 
yates said the compromise probably wouldnt have a significant 
impact on what art gets federal backing 
the endowment hasnt been known to approve very adventurous 
art in the past he said 
the endowments for the arts and humanities would get 250000 in 
the bill to form a commission to study how grants are awarded and 
determine whether criteria are needed for works to qualify for 
grants 
negotiators also agreed that grants this year to the two 
organizations that displayed the art works that sparked the 
controversy will be subjected to congressional review 
senators had sought a fiveyear ban on funding to the 
southeastern center for contemporary art in winstonsalem nc 
and the institute for contemporary art at the university of 
pennsylvania 
the north carolina center exhibited a photograph by andres 
serrano depicting a crucifix in a jar of urine the pennsylvania 
group showed photographs by robert mapplethorpe depicting children 
in erotic poses and homosexual and sadomasochistic themes

scientists say a strong hole in the earths 
ozone concentration in the stratosphere is developing over 
antarctica and could get worse as the south polar winter continues 
the ozone levels over antarctica have been decreasing by about 
15 percent per day through september scientists at nasas goddard 
space flight center in greenbelt md said friday a week before 
the ozone concentration had decreased by about 30 percent from the 
beginning of the month officials said 
dr arlin krueger of nasa said the rate of decrease in ozone is 
almost equal to the rate of decline in 1987 when a record ozone 
depletion was observed on oct 5 
the ultimate depth of this years ozone hole will depend on 
how long the current rate of decrease is maintained said kruger 
officials said a powerful polar vortex formed over antarctica in 
august with extremely cold temperatures these conditions are 
ideal according to current theory for the formation of polar 
stratospheric clouds which are thought to increase the depletion 
of ozone 
holes in the ozone above the antarctic develop only during the 
winter months when conditions are right depletions also have been 
detected over the arctic region during the cold season but they 
generally are less severe normal levels of ozone seem to restore 
themselves with the change of season 
ozone in the stratosphere forms a protective layer against 
ultraviolet rays from the sun an excess exposure to uv radiation 
is thought to be a major cause of skin cancer some studies also 
have found that an increase in uv radiation also can harm many 
plants and can depress the immune system in some animals including 
humans 
nasa scientists have been monitoring ozone levels over the 
southern hemisphere using an instrument on board the nimbus7 
satellite for more than 10 years 
earlier studies have indicated that stratospheric ozone can be 
broken down through a chemical action initiated by some manmade 
chemicals principally cholorfluorocarbons these compounds called 
cfcs are used for refrigeration and for making some plastics 
products 
some us manufacturers and users of cfcs have announced plans 
to stop making the chemical compound or to guard against releasing 
the chemicals to the atmosphere 
ozone a major component of smog is an atmospheric pollutant at 
ground level but it forms an important part of the radiation 
protection belt surrounding the earth in the stratosphere which 
begins about 9 miles above the earth and extends upward to about 
39 miles 
ozone is a substance composed of three atoms of oxygen it is 
created naturally during thunderstorms common atmospheric oxygen 
is composed of two atoms

the food and drug administration wants two 
companies to explain their claims that grain used in three new 
breakfast cereal can help lower cholesterol 
the fda said friday that it has serious concerns about the 
amounts of grain general mills and the kellogg co are using in the 
cereals and asked them to submit scientific data showing the levels 
of grain are safe 
general mills makes benefit cereal and kellogg makes heartwise 
and bran buds 
the cereals contain husks of psyllium which contains soluble 
fiber which the companies say is safe and has been shown to help 
reduce cholesterol benefit also contains sugar beet fiber and the 
fda asked general mills to submit data showing it also is safe 
spokesmen for both companies said their cereals are safe and 
that they would submit the requested data 
bran buds has been on the market for a year benefit is being 
sold in selected test markets but heartwise is not on the market 
yet 
proctor amp gamble co which uses psyllium in its metamucil 
laxative raised the question of whether psyllium is a drug or food 
additive the company had asked the fda to pull benefit off the 
market because the cereal had not been subjected to drugtesting 
requirements 
proctor amp gamble had asked the fda to let it make 
cholesterollowering claims for metamucil but was told more study 
was needed we hope the fda will take further action to eliminate 
the inconsistency in allowing these new cereals to make 
cholesterolreduction claims while metamucil cannot company 
spokesman bill dobson said reacting to the fdas action 
the fda outlined its concerns in separate letters to general 
mills and kellogg 
we recognize that recent recommendations concerning diet 
emphasizes the need for consumers to increase their intake of 
fibercontaining foods the fda letters said we generally see 
no problem when this increase is accomplished by the consumption of 
foods high in naturally occurring fiber 
in the case of an ingredient that is intended to be added to 
various food products to increase the levels of fiber in those 
foods however we believe there are some serious concerns that 
should be considered first 
the fda said there are well known safety concerns associated 
with use of psyllium including possible allergic reactions the 
agency noted that geneal mills has warned on its label about this 
possibility provides instructions for its use on the package label 
and advises consuming the cereal with adequate liquids and 
restricting consumption by children

the average prices farmers receive for their 
raw products are continuing to decline from last years record 
heights the agriculture department says 
the departments price index hit an 11month low in september 
falling 07 percent from august to leave the monthly average also 
07 percent below the level a year ago the usda said in 
preliminary figures released friday 
lower prices for cattle hogs and potatoes were mostly 
responsible for the decrease from the august average the 
departments agricultural statistics board said in its report 
higher prices for oranges milk lettuce and applies partly 
offset the decline for the other commodities during the month 
compared with a year earlier lower prices for soybeans corn 
tomatoes and oats more than offset higher prices for milk cotton 
potatoes and eggs the report said 
milk prices gained for the fourth consecutive month winding up 
in september at the highest level since february 1985 
feed grain prices were mixed but corn the major component of 
this index increased three cents per bushel from august the 
report said an 18cent per bushel decrease in the price of 
soybeans moved the oilbearing crop index lower 
no change was reported in the prices farmers pay to meet 
expenses those are adjusted every three months and the next will 
be reported in october the july prices paid index was up 06 
percent from april and 35 percent from july 1988 
department economists say net cash income of farmers gross 
cash income minus cash expenses is expected to decline 5 percent 
to 13 percent from last years record of 599 billion 
the 1988 drought forced commodity prices up and many producers 
were able to sell harvests at the higher prices thus more than 
offsetting reduced production also many farmers had grain stored 
from previous crops and were able to cash in as prices rose 
economists say the cash income decline this year is expected to 
stem from farmers larger cash expenses as they boost plantings 
and also because of lower federal subsidies 
consumer food prices are forecast by usda to rise an average of 
5 percent to 7 percent this year following a 41 percent increase 
in 1988 
based on the preliminary figures the september price index for 
livestock and livestock products as a group decreased 19 percent 
from august but averaged 33 percent above the yearearlier level 
crop prices overall rose 08 percent from august but averaged 
59 percent less than in september 1988 
the allfruit price index for september was up 22 percent from 
august and was 64 percent above a year ago the report said 
rising prices for oranges had the greatest impact on the index 
followed by apples peaches strawberries lemons and grapefruit 
prices of commercial vegetables dropped 10 percent from august 
averaging 16 percent below a year ago the report said 
the overall index of prices paid to farmers in september 
averaged 143 percent of a 1977 base used for comparison down from 
144 percent in august that was the lowest for the index since 
october 1988

egyptian president hosni mubarak saying a 
historic opportunity for peace in the middle east is at hand 
called on israel to open talks with the palestine liberation 
organization 
in an address friday before the un general assembly he also 
urged israel to swap territory captured in mideast wars for peace 
israel has steadfastly refused to negotiate with the plo 
calling it a terrorist organization dedicated to destruction of the 
jewish state 
mubarak called the plo the sole legitimate representative of 
the palestinian people he said the organization had adopted 
positive attitudes toward a peace settlement and deserves all 
welcome and support from the international community 
in another major speech to the 159member general assembly 
friday president virgilio barco of colombia said drug barons are 
at war with the world 
he appealed to all nations to sign the vienna convention on 
narcotics trafficking which provides penalties for drug users and 
dealers including seizure of ships on high seas and confiscation of 
properties 
a new world war is being waged by an aggressor unrestrained by 
the traditional rules of engagement or by the responsibilities of 
national sovereignty barco said 
barco is under death threats from colombian cocaine cartels 
security precautions for his un appearance included sharpshooters 
atop buildings bombsniffing dogs and reinforced un police 
barco said the demand for narcotics must be blocked 
those who consume cocaine are contributing to the assassination 
of the colombian people by criminals he said no doubt somebody 
a few blocks from this general assembly hall in one of this citys 
fashionable neighborhoods taking cocaine in the civilized calm of 
his living room would balk at this description 
he said that person is as guilty as the trigger men who have 
murdered colombian judges and policemen 
us secretary of state james a baker iii said friday that 
mubaraks peace plan for the middle east is negotiable 
the real question is what position the government of israel 
takes when the cabinet meets next week baker told a news 
conference at the us mission to the united nations 
the egyptian 10 points is not a competing proposal it is 
simply a method of trying to get implementation of the shamir 
proposal baker said 
he referred to israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir and his 
rightwing likud bloc 
likud rejects the concept of trading land for peace while its 
uneasy partner in the coalition government the centerleft labor 
party has indicated it would accept some territorial concessions 
in may shamir proposed elections among palestinians to choose 
representatives to negotiate with israel for limited 
selfgovernment in the israelioccupied territories 
the name of the game right now it seems to me is to get 
israelis and palestinians talking to each other baker said 
mubarak offered to host preliminary israelipalestinian talks in 
cairo to pave the way for shamirs election plan 
letting the existing opportunity slip by will be a grievous 
mistake exceeding all errors made in the past which led to loss of 
historic opportunities to contain the conflict and avoid its 
aggression mubarak said 
egypt is the only arab country to sign a peace treaty with 
israel and mubarak has been acting as a mediator dealing primarily 
with moderates in both the arab and israeli camps

former cia and kgb spies agreed 
after a remarkable meeting that one mans terrorist isnt another 
mans freedom fighter and called for a ussoviet effort to 
combat morally reprehensible violence 
practical steps must be taken to combat the danger of 
international terrorism and eliminate the conditions under which it 
has operated with impunity lt gen fjodor sherbak former 
deputy chief of the soviet kgbs second directorate said friday at 
the end of the weeklong conference 
ray cline deputy director of the central intelligence agency 
from 1962 to 1966 agreed 
we have a common interest in knocking this thing off this 
very dangerous phenomenon is tearing at the fabric of international 
civilization cline said 
the meeting of more than 20 members of the private ussoviet 
task force to prevent terrorism was held behind closed doors at the 
rand corp a santa monicabased think tank 
the group also included us and soviet academics and 
journalists as well as william colby a former cia director and 
maj gen valentin zvezdenskov former counterterrorism chief of 
the kgb the soviet secret police and intelligence agency 
participants announced 30 recommendations they will pass to 
their respective governments for future cooperation 
we reached common ground that there are some forms of violence 
that are absolutely unacceptable said augustus richard norton a 
professor at the us military academy at west point ny 
the old line that one mans terrorist is another mans freedom 
fighter is absolutely wrong he said one mans terrorist is 
another mans terrorist 
cline said there are clear definitions of illegal terrorist acts 
hijackings the taking of hostages and bombings of planes for 
example 
such acts are wrong legally and morally reprehensible he 
said 
we recognize there is such a thing as acts of terrorism that 
are directed against universal human values international 
relations national sovereignty and the greatest value of all 
human life said evgeny ljakhov an official of the soviet 
ministry of the interior which is roughly equivalent to the us 
justice department 
a complete list of the task forces recommendations was not 
released because they are in draft form and many will be more 
effective if they are privately conveyed to both governments said 
brian jenkins a rand corp expert on terrorism 
but a news release and conference participants said they 
included 
expansion of existing ussoviet nuclear crisis control 
centers to exchange information and deal with terrorist threats to 
use biological chemical and nuclear weapons 
increased cooperation to prevent and investigate airplane 
bombings and aid the release of hostages held by terrorists 
particularly in the middle east and southeast asia 
agreement by both nations to refuse to train terrorists or 
provide nongovernment groups with plastic explosives nuclear 
materials surfacetoair missiles or other weapons useful to 
terrorists 
cooperation to restrict the laundering of drug money to 
exchange information on drug production smuggling and distribution 
in latin america and southwest asia and to explore providing 
assistance to peru colombia and other nations on the front lines 
of the war against narcoterrorism 
joint efforts to restrict the ability of terrorists to cross 
international borders and gain access to funds 
greater cooperation in international law enforcement including 
a ussoviet agreement on extradition and prosecution of 
terrorists

the bush administration intends to sell 300 
tanks to saudi arabia in a move certain to renew strong debate in 
congress over the sale of american arms to arab countries 
secretary of state james a baker iii announced the plans 
friday saying the administration will go ahead with it despite 
israeli objections 
baker said the administration which has been trying to bolster 
its ties to arab countries it considers moderates will still try 
to find a basis for negotiations between israel and palestinian 
arabs 
israel registered its objections after baker notified foreign 
minister moshe arens defense minister yitzhak rabin and finance 
minister shimon peres of the intended sale israeli embassy 
spokeswoman ruth yaron said in washington 
the deal could complicate us negotiating efforts in the middle 
east and touch off a fight in congress which has the power to 
block the saudi purchase 
us arms sales to the arab world usually raise security 
concerns in israel and among its congressional supporters the 
purchase would go through after formal notification unless a 
majority of both the house and senate voted to kill it 
the tanks deal could be worth up to 1 billion depending on the 
equipment included with the improved version of the m1a1 intended 
for the saudis 
congress over the years has turned back several us arms sales 
to arab countries out of concern for israels security 
baker played a key and successful role as white house chief of 
staff in 1981 when the reagan administrations sale of advanced 
radar surveillance planes to saudi arabia cleared the senate by a 
narrow vote 
proisrael lobbyists have shown little inclination lately of 
confronting the white house on projected arab arms sales but the 
purchase of modern tanks could set off alarm bells 
baker and his aides are arguing that the saudis are politically 
moderate and would purchase tanks from other western countries if 
they could not get them from the united states 
but mrs yaron said her government urged the administration not 
to sell arms to arab countries that are officially still at war 
with israel 
mrs yaron said that after the white house formally notifies 
congress she was certain the house and senate will consider the 
element of security for israel

senators say that failure to provide the money 
to pay compensation to an estimated 60000 japaneseamericans 
interned during world war ii would amount to another act of 
injustice 
if we dont act we will have committed another act of 
incivility passing a law and then doing nothing sen pete v 
domenici dnm said friday in supporting a bill to waive budget 
restrictions and grant the money for reparations 
the senate voted 7422 to waive the budget restrictions keeping 
a promise made last year by making the compensation an entitlement 
under law 
congress last year authorized reparations for japaneseamericans 
who had been interned during the war but appropriated no money 
because of the budget crunch 
the 500 million reparations program will make 20000 payments 
available to each of the eligible japaneseamericans at the 
beginning of the 1991 fiscal year oct 1 1990 
no funds are provided for fiscal 1990 which begins sunday 
last years legislation authorized 125 billion for the 
payments but limited the amount that could be appropriated in any 
single year to 500 million 
the reparations payments were made part of a pending 173 
billion appropriations bill for the commerce justice and state 
departments which was approved by voice vote the money is not 
included in the house bill so housesenate conferees will have to 
work out the difference 
sen jesse helms rnc tried to block the senate action 
we cant afford to make these payments he said 
mistakes are made in every war helms said dismissing 
arguments that the united states must make the payments to correct 
a mistake that harmed an entire class of us citizens 
but other senators said guaranteed compensation was essential to 
rectify an injustice 
there are times here when we deal with fiscal reality but 
there are also times when we have to set fiscal reality aside and 
look at what is the right thing to do said sen warren rudman 
rnh one of the principal authors of the grammrudman deficit 
reduction act 
sen daniel k inouye dhawaii who is of japaneseamerican 
descent told the senate he had only rarely spoken in behalf of 
compensating the internees because of my own ethnic background 
however he said that because of that reluctance i may have 
done many of those japaneseamericans with whom i served in world 
war ii a great disservice 
inouye lost his right arm in combat in italy during service with 
a japaneseamerican infantry regiment and was awarded the 
distinguished service cross the nations second highest award for 
valor 
he said many of the men in his unit came from families who were 
detained in us internment camps and who volunteered to defend 
their country from behind barbed wire

lawmakers from the northwest say a compromise 
on logging in oldgrowth forests will protect the spotted owls that 
live in the forests and satisfy lumber interests 
we protected habitat and jobs rep les aucoin dore said 
after a tense day of closeddoor negotiations produced agreement in 
a housesenate conference committee friday 
i would say environmentalists came out with a pretty deal as 
well as the workers in the timber community said sen mark 
hatfield rore 
both the house and senate could act next week on the 11 billion 
appropriations bill for the interior department and related 
agencies that includes the compromise 
lawmakers have been searching for a way to ensure northwest 
mills of a steady supply of timber from the regions oldgrowth 
forests while the us fish and wildlife service decides whether to 
declare the northern spotted owl an endangered species 
such declarations require federal agencies to protect the 
habitats of the species in question the spotted owl lives almost 
exclusively in oldgrowth forests and each pair requires a very 
large area 
the compromise provides that 
federal timber sales in the region would be set at 96 billion 
board feet over the next 12 months about 1 billion board feet 
below current levels 
the forest service and bureau of land management would be 
required to minimize fragmentation of significant oldgrowth 
forest stands and no sales would be allowed in areas already 
identified as spotted owl habitat 
court challenges to individual timber sales would be allowed 
but they would have to be filed within 15 days of the sale offering 
and the courts would have to decide within 45 days 
roughly half of the 2 billion board feet in sales currently 
enjoined by federal courts would be released 
hatfield said the compromise would assure the industry of a 
steady supply of timber over the next year by insulating it from 
lawsuits and appeals which at one point had tied up half the sales 
planned in the region during the current fiscal year 
jim bloomquist of the sierra club said the compromise appeared 
to be something environmentalists could accept he cited a smaller 
harvest more protection for owls and virgin timber and elimination 
of a senate provision that would have imposed a 12month ban on 
federal court orders blocking timber sales 
it is a positive response to many of the concerns we had with 
the senate legislation bloomquist said 
while aucoin hatfield and other members from the region 
acknowledged the there still may be layoffs in the industry they 
said the legislation would minimize the economic damage to the 
region

shannon chevrier hoped to get federal 
aid to help cover the losses she suffered from hurricane hugo but 
instead she got a packet full of paperwork and was told it might be 
two months before she saw any money 
i expected something a little bit quicker miss chevrier 
24 said friday after visiting a federal emergency management 
agency center set up to help hurricane victims 
we dont need help two months from now we need it right 
away she said im out of work im out of money im angry 
the charleston woman one of hundreds of people who sought help 
at one of five emergency centers has not worked since the 
hurricane hit sept 21 the bookkeeping firm that employs her has 
been closed because the city is largely without power 
she called the government response too little too late i 
would expect in something like this the federal government would 
respond quicker 
president bush toured the stormdamaged areas for two hours 
friday and acknowledged afterward that theres been a critic or 
two of the federal relief effort to the critics i simply say 
i understand we are trying very hard he said 
fema set up the centers to help residents apply for cash grants 
lowinterest loans and jobless benefits they can also seek answers 
to questions about insurance claims how to claim losses on tax 
forms and register complaints about gouging 
but for many cutting through a tangle of government red tape is 
just the latest hardship spawned by the storm that crashed into 
charleston with 135 mph winds 
there have been complaints that there are too few centers and 
that the process is too slow the first centers did not open until 
thursday a full week after the storm hit 
i thought they were kidding about the paperwork its 
ridiculous said genie vanbenschoten 26 holding a packet of 
forms she needed to fill out and return 
those who came to one center friday were given applications and 
scheduled for an appointment some will not be seen until oct 10 
most of these people have lost everything i feel for them but 
this process is necessary fema manager shirley caraway said 
fema can provide loans of up to 100000 to repair or replace 
homes up to 20000 to replace personal property and up to 
500000 for businesses 
also available are funds for temporary housing rental 
assistance and individual and family grants for needs not covered 
by insurance 
fema said 2071 people had applied for federal aid at five 
disaster relief centers in charleston mount pleasant sumter 
myrtle beach and georgetown by friday afternoon another 5710 made 
appointments to return next week 
five more centers were scheduled to open over the weekend in 
lancaster manning camden kingstree and moncks corner 
ron ruffennach a fema spokesman said individuals income is 
used to determine whether they are awarded grants or lowinterest 
loans 
one fema center is handling about 60 people every two hours and 
officials said that by today they would handle 90 people within two 
hours 
those who need immediate help are referred to the red cross or 
salvation army which have representatives at the center the red 
cross can issue vouchers for food clothing shelter towels soap 
or other necessities 
some people expected immediate help from the government but 
fema officials said claims must be processed and verified before 
taxpayers dollars are released 
people filing emergency unemployment claims may wait for two to 
three weeks officials would not say how long it might take for 
small business loans to be forthcoming 
you dont come in today and get a check tomorrow said jean 
king of the south carolina employment security commission 
rumors and misinformation have been rampant said kathryn 
kidd of the university of south carolina sociology department who 
was assisting fema 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr was an early critic of the 
federal response 
we really need more disaster assistance centers riley said 
they were slow getting started and i think that shows maybe some 
weakness in the system

the soviets once called crime a product of 
capitalism meaning it wasnt their problem now officials 
acknowledge the soviet union has the fastestgrowing crime rate in 
the world and say they are alarmed 
lawbreaking was up 50 percent in some areas this year to cope 
the kgb secret police has been enlisted to combat racketeering and 
lawmakers endorsed an emergency anticrime program 
in crime increaseslamentably the soviet union is now no 
1 said gennady v dashkov an official at a moscowbased 
research institute affiliated with the state prosecutors office 
in the central russian city of gorky workers created vigilante 
groups called workers militias to combat crime in moscow new 
frenchbuilt armored cars now pick up the days receipts from large 
stores and savings banks 
despite such measures president mikhail s gorbachev told the 
supreme soviet legislature monday that the increase in crime 
continues 
one cannot fail to see that although law enforcement bodies 
have begun to operate more boldly and actively and the public has 
begun to support them more it is too early to speak of a 
turnaround gorbachev said crime is still on the rise 
soviet newspapers are peppered with the litany of offenses the 
firebombing of a moscow restaurant allegedly by racketeers bank 
heists in armenia and moscow and bands of roving toughs who beat 
up welldressed muscovites 
soviet car owners have long removed windshield wipers to thwart 
petty thieves but drivers report brazen robbers now steal the 
windshields themselves for resale on a black market in car parts 
the crime wave is a shock to many in part because the 
governments longtime penchant for distorting or concealing the 
seamy details of soviet life makes public acknowledgement of any 
problem the more startling 
in addition officials say the uncertainties and shifting social 
and economic rules of gorbachevs domestic reforms are a direct 
cause of the growing crime problem 
world practice shows that this situation is typical of any 
society living through a transitional period the nations top 
policeman interior minister vadim bakatin told the official 
soviet news agency tass recently 
bakatins deputy vasily trushin went on state television 
earlier this month to tell people the problem is nationwide and 
that crime is increasing in each of the countrys 15 republics 
in the first eight months of 1989 more than 15 million crimes 
were reported in the soviet union a 332 percent jump over the 
same period last year trushin said 
in the baltic republics of lithuania and estonia where crime 
had been rare reports of lawbreaking were up 50 percent he said 
most worrisome to soviets is the leap in grave crimes 
including violent offenses such as murder rape and robbery that 
once were considered afflictions of the united states and other 
western societies 
in the first eight months of 1989 grave crimes increased 
408 percent even faster than the overall soviet crime rate 
trushin said 
he said crime statistics are influenced by other social forces 
which for years were contained by the police state but are being 
vented in the less repressive climate instituted by gorbachev 
ethnic strife for instance has had a dramatic impact on crime 
statistics 
trushin said that in one week in the nagornokarabakh district 
scene of a longrunning jurisdictional dispute between the 
republics of azerbaijan and armenia 16 attacks on cars were 
registered along with one murder six cases of arson and 60 bodily 
injuries 
the official alarm about crime contrasts starkly with 
marxistleninist orthodoxy about the origins of illegal behavior 
in 1987 two years after gorbachev came to power the soviet 
book fundamentals of criminalists declared having appeared 
under exploitation of man by man crime can be eliminated only 
after doing away with exploitation hence in the ussr there 
are realistic objective conditions for eradicating crime 
soviet criminologists have now discarded that thinking perhaps 
in part because the present rise in crime could imply that 
gorbachevs economic and political reforms permit more exploitation 
a man kills his wife say out of jealousy dashkov said in 
an interview thats going to exist under socialism just like 
under capitalism 
like gorbachev he and other researchers at the allunion 
research institute on the problems of strengthening legality expect 
the trend to continue 
the rise will stop when soviet people are certain that 
tomorrow will be better than today that they wont be unemployed 
or without a place to live dashkov said 
two government periodicals squabbled last month over whether the 
united states or the soviet union has a worse crime problem 
interior ministry lt col v prokopenko said statistics showed the 
dubious honor still belongs to the americans 
there are only 59 murders per 100000 soviets compared to 89 
per 100000 in america prokopenko told the official weekly 
arguments and facts he said there were 91000 rapes in the united 
states last year or more than five times the 17600 rapes reported 
in the more populous soviet union

boots wallets and belts the 
conventional results of floridas annual alligator hunt have made 
room for a more imaginative batch of byproducts ranging from 
freezedried gator heads to gator spread 
with the end of the second statesanctioned alligator hunt 
tonight taxidermists hunting stores and souvenir shops are trying 
to outdo each other in providing an everwidening array of gator 
knickknacks 
you would be amazed said ernie santo of an orlando shop 
called gatorland alligator products are becoming more and more 
exclusive and more and more popular 
thats mainly because florida and louisiana are the only 
places to get gators santo said people love this stuff 
a popular item carried by gatorland is the freezedried gator 
head which sells for 7995 
just what anybody might want to do with such an offbeat item is 
left up to customers imagination 
in clewiston the heart of the monthlong hunt on the shores of 
lake okeechobee the field and stream shop has a gatorfoot back 
scratcher for 2495 and the skip shop in waldo offers key chains 
made from gator toes for 995 apiece 
statelicensed gator trapper mike rafferty says he couldnt keep 
up with demand for gator bricabrac after last years hunt 
this year he has expanded his product range 
ive come out with a gourmet food line he said ive got 
alligator spread smoked alligator and alligator fritters 
alligator meat he explained is low in fat and high in protein 
theyre good for you rafferty concluded 
the booming business in alligator byproducts represents a 
radical change for the reptile which only a few years ago was 
considered a prime candidate for floridas state animal 
but in 1982 the florida alligator lost out in that contest to 
the endangered florida panther and while it remains against the 
law to kill a panther gators have become fair game for selected 
hunters across the state every september 
the principle reason for that turnaround is that the gators have 
flourished under their protected status in recent years 
theyre a renewable resource according to lindsey hord of 
the florida game and fresh water fish commission in okeechobee 
and as long as they are theres absolutely no sense in the 
people of florida not taking advantage of it 
its my belief thats why gators were put here hord said 
for us to use and people sure are using them

el salvadors leftist guerrillas expect a 
complete halt in aid from nicaragua after last months central 
american peace accords but say they will maintain themselves as a 
fighting force anyway 
we expect the nicaraguans to comply with the peace accords not 
100 percent but 101 percent miguel saenz of the farabundo 
marti national liberation fronts politicalmilitary commission 
said in an interview friday 
nicaraguas president daniel ortega and the four other central 
american presidents signed a peace accord on aug 7 in which they 
agreed that no irregular forces would be allowed to operate from 
their territories 
the accord also called for disbanding nicaraguas ussupported 
contra rebels in exchange for democratic elections and other 
reforms inside nicaragua 
the sandinistas have to abide by the accords theyve signed 
they have a lot to gain saenz said 
saenz and salvador samayoa another front official also said 
they expected salvadoran president alfredo cristiani to offer an 
immediate unconditional ceasefire when he speaks to the united 
nations general assembly on monday 
they said a ceasefire in el salvador was impossible without 
agreement on measures to advance democracy and protect leftist 
activists 
if there are no guarantees a ceasefire is a fiction said 
salvador samayoa a member of the fronts politicaldiplomatic 
commission they will keep imprisoning our activists there will 
still be violence its all a kind of show 
the two officials said peace talks earlier this month in mexico 
city went well and that they were optimistic about a second 
session on oct 16 to 17 in costa rica even though they felt 
cristianis rightist government is stalling 
they really believe we depend on the nicaraguans said 
samayoa they figure if they stall the talks time is on their 
side well get weaker and theyll win 
if they stick to that we will have to show that their 
analysis is wrong through more confrontation samayoa said the 
two officials noted that the front launched an offensive this week 
that has affected 10 of the nations 14 provinces 
salvadoran guerrilla sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity have said there are 150000 weapons available for 
purchase in central america and that the guerrillas have the 
resources to buy them 
among the sellers these sources say are the gradually 
disbanding contra guerrillas who have been fighting the sandinista 
government in nicaragua since 1981 
samayoa said that even if the front cannot win el salvadors 
10yearold civil war militarily that does not mean a victory for 
the government 
supposing we cant win we can guarantee they wont be able to 
carry out their programs said samayoa its not just a 
question of winning but a question of governing and of 
reactivating the economy 
the war in el salvador has taken more than 70000 lives and 
wrecked the economy in the nation of 5 million despite a total of 
38 billion in us economic and military aid 
in a peace proposal made in mexico city the rebels demanded 
judicial reforms an end to repression maintenance of economic 
especially land reforms made since 1980 and a cleansing and 
shrinking of the army 
they also asked for democratic constitutional reforms and 
clearly defined ceasefire lines in a notable change from previous 
proposals the guerrillas did not demand a powersharing 
arrangement in advance of a settlement

a jury convicted the leader of the operation 
rescue antiabortion group of charges resulting from a protest at a 
health clinic during last years democratic national convention 
randall terry was convicted friday of criminal trespass and 
unlawful assembly charges 
the state then asked judge john bruner to impose the maximum 
sentence of 12 months in prison and a fine of 1000 for each of 
the two counts at terrys request though the judge postponed 
sentencing until thursday 
terry who remained free on a personal recognizance bond told 
reporters that the trial had been a classic example of a 
miscarriage of justice a kangaroo court 
how could i expect justice in a court that protects 
murderers he added a reference to repeated rulings from the 
judge that abortion was not on trial 
chief assistant solicitor robert lee obrien who prosecuted the 
case told bruner after the verdict that terrys conduct throughout 
the trial led the state to believe he will continue engaging in 
unlawful activities of this nature 
he urged the judge to impose the maximum combination of jail 
time and fines but said that if he intended to waive a jail 
sentence the judge should order that the fines collected before 
allowing terry to leave the courts jurisdiction 
terry appealed for a delay before sentencing to allow me time 
to get my house in order he promised to return saying im a 
national leader theres no place to run i wouldnt want to run 
anyway it would be a disgrace to the cause 
in closing arguments terry who represented himself without a 
lawyer said he was a wouldbe rescuer of unborn children obrien 
called him a man intent on pressing his own moral values on others 
terry is among 60 antiabortion demonstrators on the trial in 
fulton county state court but only a handful are expected to be 
tried in the next few weeks 
more than 1200 arrests were made during at least 20 protests at 
various abortion clinics organized by operation rescue during the 
summer and fall of 1988

three soldiers convicted in the beating of a 
palestinian were released early in a case viewed as a test of the 
armys commitment to punishing troops who use brutality against the 
arab uprising 
the palestinian hani elshami later died in a second beating 
by other soldiers a military court said his case has been one of 
the most contentious and publicized in the 21monthold palestinian 
revolt against israeli rule of the occupied lands 
the government announced the pardon on friday just hours before 
the start of rosh hashana the jewish new year the soldiers who 
were sentenced to nine months for brutality had three more months 
to serve 
israeli liberals warned that releasing the three men could 
encourage further abuse by soldiers faced with the task of putting 
down the revolt 
its a sign to other soldiers that this act is not really so 
bad yossi sarid a parliament member from the leftist citizens 
rights movement party told israel radio 
maj gen matal vilnai chief of the armys southern command 
cut the soldiers sentences resulting in their immediate release 
he barred them from returning to the elite givati infantry brigade 
in which they had served 
the action is only a reduction of the actual prison time an 
army statement said vilnai does not erase the crime and the 
conviction which remain attributed to these soldiers 
defense minister yitzhak rabin who reportedly asked vilnai to 
cut the soldiers sentences told israel radio that bad publicity 
over the case had hurt army morale 
the three men and a fourth soldier initially were charged with 
manslaughter in the death of elshami 42 who was beaten with 
rifle butts and a broomstick at his home in the gaza strips 
jabaliya refugee camp on aug 22 1988 
they were found innocent of the charge in may by a military 
court which ruled elshami died after a later beating by other 
soldiers the defendants were convicted of brutality and no 
charges have been brought against any other soldiers in the case 
the fourth defendant was freed earlier after completing his 
sixmonth sentence 
the soldiers contended they were following orders 
also friday prime minister yitzhak shamir said in a newspaper 
interview that israel can live with the intefadeh the arabic 
word for the uprising that began in december 1987 
shamir told the davar daily the government has not used all its 
means to crush the revolt 
if israel is always convinced that it cannot compromise or 
give in to these demands it will continue to stand in this fight 
and it can continue for a long time we are stronger they are the 
sufferers he said 
in the occupied gaza strip shefta khalil abu tarr 70 was 
beaten to death in the town of khan yunis by fellow arabs who 
accused him of collaborating with israeli authorities arab 
reporters said 
the killing brought to 122 the number of arabs killed by other 
palestinians as suspected collaborators since the uprising began 
575 arabs have been killed by israeli soldiers or jewish settlers 
and 40 israelis have been slain

team the st louis cardinals he was mr anheuserbusch mr 
budweiser mr cardinal and he was mr st louis said fred 
kuhlmann chief operating officer of the cardinals 
busch was hospitalized on aug 29 for routine tests and returned

busch made anheuserbusch the brewing giant it is today and he 
built the cardinals into one of baseballs most successful teams 
at the time of his death he was the honorary chairman of the 
board of anheuserbusch president and chief executive officer of 
the cardinals and a civic leader 
at the start of each baseball season busch would ride atop the

million needed the company now owns the stadium 
he was clearly one of the legendary leaders of st louis

resulted in bringing busch stadium into downtown st louis formed 
the basis for three decades of growth in downtown st louis he 
will be sorely missed

the company in operation despite the fact that its chief product 
had been proclaimed illegal

and salt syrup refrigeration cabinets soft drinks and car and 
truck bodies 
with the death of august a busch sr in 1934 control of the 
company passed to his two sons adolphus busch iii died of cancer

the infant mortality rate in the nations 
capital jumped nearly 50 percent during the first half of this year 
because more babies were born to women addicted to cocaine a 
published report says 
it is like a bomb has gone off said an unidentified health 
official who participated in a meeting on infant mortality with 
washington dc mayor marion barry this week no one in this 
area knows what to do i dont know what to do about social 
pathology and decay in half the city 
preliminary data that health officials presented to the mayor 
shows that 169 infants died during the first six months of 1989 
sources told the washington post in a story published in todays 
editions that translates to an infant mortality rate of 323 
deaths per 1000 live births triple the national average of 99 
deaths per 1000 in 1988 and highest in the country 
the district of columbias infant mortality rate during 1988 was 
232 deaths per 1000 live births according to the national center 
for health statistics 
city officials predicted in january that infant mortality would 
continue to rise because of the epidemic use of crack cocaine 
which causes the uterus to contract cutting off oxygen and 
inducing premature labor 
top private medical professionals asked barry for more city 
assistance in caring for babies abandoned in hospitals by 
drugaddicted mothers as well as help for the women themselves and 
other children affected by illegal drugs 
health officials said the cutoff last year of congressional 
funding for abortions in the city can be blamed for some of the 
increase because many cocaineaddicted mothers continued 
pregnancies they might have aborted 
before the funding cut the city was paying for more than 3000 
abortions annually the 1990 district budget recently approved by 
congress would restore the citys right to fund abortions but 
president bush has threatened to veto the measure 
we find the argument that abortion prevents infant mortality 
incomprehensible douglas johnson a spokesman for the national 
right to life committee said friday abortion is infant 
mortality 
the mayor declined to discuss the details of the meeting 
participants included city public health commissioner reed v 
tuckson john dandridge jr executive director of dc general 
hospital and representatives of some of the districts private 
hospitals

attorney general dick thornburgh will have to 
take action to drop criminal charges against an irancontra figure 
if he wants to protect secrets from being disclosed at the mans 
trial according to an appeals court ruling 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals in 
richmond va on friday rebuffed thornburgh and said he could not 
otherwise intervene to challenge secrecy rulings in the case 
against joseph f fernandez a former cia agent 
the appeals court held that only independent counsel lawrence e 
walsh could appeal rulings allowing the disclosure of government 
secrets in the trial 
the court said thornburghs only recourse to protect the secrets 
would be to exercise a politically unpalatable option the attorney 
general had sought to avoid filing a motion that could lead to 
the dismissal of charges 
thornburgh had sought to intervene to prevent the disclosure of 
the location of cia facilities in central america that the trial 
judge held could be made public as part of fernandezs defense 
the appellate panel said thornburgh can still file an affidavit 
blocking the release of the documents in open court a move that 
could force dismissal of the charges against fernandez by us 
district judge claude hilton of alexandria va 
the appellate court agreed with walshs contention that allowing 
the attorney general to appeal secrecy rulings in the case would 
undermine the independent counsels ability to prosecute the case 
we are of course gratified by their decision and we will 
proceed with the case walsh said in a statement 
thornburghs spokesman david runkel said were reviewing 
the various options which the department has at this time 
those options include seeking a rehearing of the case by the 4th 
circuit or appealing the ruling to the supreme court runkel said 
in addition there is the option of discussing this with the 
independent counsel to see if he could resolve the issue there 
he said 
fernandez who headed the cias station in san jose costa rica 
is accused of lying to agency superiors and a presidential 
commission that investigated the irancontra affair about his role 
in helping north set up a covert arms supply network for the 
nicaraguan contras

south carolina desperately needs to 
build 65 miles of protective sand dunes in just over two weeks to 
prevent further damage to a coastline already devastated by 
hurricane hugo gov carroll campbell said 
if we dont do this now im afraid were going to forego the 
coast campbell said friday its mindboggling but we can do 
it 
the state faces a race to beat a onceinadecade high tide that 
begins in midoctober the high tide is expected to cause more 
beach erosion and further damage to already fragile structures 
along the coast 
carroll and legislative leaders discussed the coastal plan after 
president bush brought sympathy and part of a 11 billion federal 
aid package during a twohour tour of stormdamaged areas 
bush bypassed charleston and toured the suburb of summerville by 
car seeing decimated trailer parks dozens of roofless buildings 
smashed cars pine forests mowed down by hugos winds later he 
rode a helicopter over the coastline and over some of the hardest 
hit areas of downtown charleston 
the hurricane was tough it was devastating bush told 
reporters 
but the spirit of the people of south carolina came through 
loud and clear he said you couldnt help but be impressed to 
hear people say were going to bounce back 
the president acknowledged that many residents have criticized 
the federal governments relief effort as too slow but said we 
are trying very hard 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said bush directed the 
federal emergency management agency to open four more 
disasterrelief offices in charleston mayor joseph riley had 
criticized fema for having only two offices in the city 
of the 11 billion in hugorelated emergency assistance bush 
signed shortly before arriving 200 million will go to south 
carolina 
the governor said he discussed the dune project with bush 
federal funds would cover threefourths of the 65 million needed 
for the project 
from oct 1417 and again from nov 1215 daily high tides will 
be more than 7 feet above the average low tide level or 2 feet 
higher than usual thats because the moon is making its closest 
approach to the earth in years 
the world thinks our coast is gone thats what they see on 
television weve got to restore the beach and get it up for next 
summer campbell said 
if the us army corps of engineers and the south carolina 
coastal council say the project is feasible were going to 
launch it right away campbell said much of the work could be 
done by 2000 members of two us army engineer battalions in south 
carolina he added 
the state department of corrections meanwhile turned down an 
appeal from soul singer james brown to be released from prison to 
give a benefit concert to raise money for relief efforts 
corrections spokesman francis x archibald said friday 
i simply want to do what i can to help restore these peoples 
lives feed the hungry and house the homeless brown said in the 
statement issued from the state park correctional facility near 
columbia sc where he is serving a sixyear sentence for 
aggravated assault and failing to stop for police 
offers of food and supplies continued to flood in from around 
the country meanwhile and charleston cut back its curfew by two 
hours a day leaving it in effect from 8 pm to 6 am 
south carolina electric amp gas co said 2000 workers from 33 
power companies in nine states were helping to restore power but 
nine days after the storm hit about 200000 residents remained 
without power about half of them in charleston

zsa zsa gabor convicted of battery 
for slapping a police officer and two other misdemeanor charges 
said her fame and outspoken selfdefense led to the verdict which 
she called ridiculous 
i know its zsa zsa gabor the diamonds she loves to talk 
up shes not a milquetoast said the actress whose courtroom 
outbursts and often outrageous outofcourt commentary on such 
topics as police brutality and lesbianism had attracted news media 
from around the world 
the jury returned guilty verdicts friday against miss gabor on 
charges she slapped a motorcycle officer during a traffic stop and 
was driving without a valid drivers license and with an open 
container of alcohol in her car 
the hungarianborn star of such movies as queen of outer 
space and picture mommy dead was acquitted on a fourth count 
of disobeying beverly hills police officer paul kramer as she drove 
away while he was still checking her motor vehicle record on june 
14 
i cant believe in a country as great as ours that a 6foot4 
policeman can beat up a lady of 5foot4 uses dirty language like 
you were a streetwalker i think russia cant be worse than 
this or communist hungary either i think its ridiculous 
but juror kevin goodman a 29yearold los angeles attorney 
said we felt a lot of weight as jurors in coming to the right 
decision we werent in a dealstriking mood there was no 
compromise 
municipal court judge charles rubin who tried to limit 
publicity by imposing what miss gabor called a gagging order 
commended the jury for its work and hailed the trial as a model of 
american justice 
the trial was scheduled for one week but took three 
miss gabor who claims to be 66 years old faces up to 18 months 
and five days in jail and a fine of 3500 sentencing was set for 
oct 17 
rubin also fined miss gabor 500 for violating his gag order by 
telling reporters that kramers fellow officer scott thompson had 
lied on the witness stand while testifying for the prosecution 
thompson was called to buttress kramers account of the 
incident which began after he pulled miss gabor over for expired 
registration tags on her white rollsroyce corniche as he checked 
for other violations she drove off 
miss gabor admitted she slapped the officer after he stopped her 
a second time she said she reacted in selfdefense when he pulled 
her from her car but he said the attack was unprovoked 
the actress dismissed the possibility friday that she would be 
incarcerated 
prosecutor eldon fox also said he would not recommend the 
actress be jailed he said he would ask that miss gabor be ordered 
to pay los angeles county for the cost of her trial estimated at 
30000 
i want the 30000 restitution to the court for this media 
circus he said 
the star often arrived for the trial in the 215000 rolls that 
had caused her so much trouble in the first place on the first 
day she brought her hairdresser with her 
at one point she told throngs of reporters her mother feared she 
might be sent to jail adding besides they are all lesbians in 
jail and im so scared of lesbians can you imagine being in jail 
with all those women 
she later apologized for the remark

there was hope that 2600 east germans 
confined to bonns embassy in czechoslovakia might be allowed to 
live in more tolerable conditions until they can flee to the west 
the government said 
but there were no indications that they and 600 other east 
german refugees waiting in bonns embassy in warsaw poland would 
be given permission to emigrate any time soon 
the west german government encouraged by the recent 
expressions of the prague government expects at least a bearable 
compromise in the humane interests of those involved klein said 
he referred to prospects for alternative housing in prague but 
declined to give details in order not to damage these very 
difficult negotiations 
since sept 10 more than 23000 east germans have fled to the 
west through hungary after that east bloc country opened its border 
to austria west germany offers automatic citizenship to east 
germans 
but czechoslovakia has said it will not allow the same kind of 
mass migration westward poland has pressed the two germanys to 
work out a solution rather than following hungarys action which 
has stirred conflict in the sovietled warsaw pact 
polish foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski said friday that 
a solution to the refugee situation in warsaw could come very 
soon 
he talked to reporters after meeting with west german foreign 
minister hansdietrich genscher in new york where both were 
attending the un general assembly session 
health conditions have deteriorated at the embassy in prague 
where refugees sleep three to a cot in tents jamming the muddy 
compound many refugees including hundreds of children are 
suffering from colds flu and other weatherrelated illnesses 
foreign ministry spokesman hanns schumacher said no serious 
infections were reported yet but swift measures were needed 
klein said pictures of the embassy grounds appearing worldwide 
testified to the human tragedy of thousands of east germans 
driven to flee by the hardline leadership in east berlin that has 
rejected calls for reform 
more than 100000 east germans have fled to west germany so far 
this year 
botho saynwittgenstein president of the west german red cross 
returned from prague on friday he said authorities were showing 
willingness to deal with the crisis in a humanitarian spirit 
prague is considering an appeal to house refugees in other 
buildings 
prague government spokesman miroslav pavel said the embassy 
situation has slowly become a problem of public order in the 
czechoslovak capital 
we cannot overdramatize or build refugee camps while awaiting 
other resolutions pavel said but he said emergency shelter was 
being considered 
the more liberal polish government has allowed east germans in 
warsaw to move about the city freely 
east berlin lawyer wolfgang vogel visited prague and warsaw this 
week and offered assurances the refugees could emigrate later if 
they first returned to east germany but fewer than 10 percent of 
refugees took up his offer 
east germans need no special permission to visit prague and 
wouldbe emigrants disillusioned with widespread shortages and 
harsh restrictions on travel and free expression appealed to the 
west german embassy to help them 
west german border authorities said 447 more east germans 
arrived in southern bavaria state in the 24 hours before friday 
noon and 200 to 300 register daily in budapest for travel to west 
germany 
the number of refugees in warsaw rose from 400 to 600 in one 
day many have risked daring escapes across the oder and neisse 
rivers

jim bakker testified that his dream of a 
christian retreat was a vision from god but the demands of fund 
raising turned it into a nightmare 
in the middle of the night i woke up bakker said friday in 
his first day on the witness stand for his fraud trial it was a 
vision or a dream i dont know god gave me the concept of the 
heritage grand partner center and i began to sketch it 
the ptl founder said his biggest burden was raising funds to 
build the heritage usa retreat and theme park near fort mill sc 
but he denied overselling partnerships in the project 
prosecutor deborah smith asked bakker why he told television 
viewers in 1984 that 50 percent of the 25000 partnerships at the 
heritage grand hotel were taken when computer records showed fewer 
than 4000 had been bought 
you were creating a false sense of urgency werent you mr 
bakker ms smith asked 
bakker said ptls computers typically ran six months behind 
adding if you believe the computer records of heritage usa i 
could sell you land under water in florida 
bakker is accused of fleecing followers of 158 million by 
overselling lifetime partnerships at the ministry the 1000 
partnerships entitled bearers to three nights lodging annually in 
ptl facilities 
defense attorneys have claimed that the partnerships were not 
sales transactions and that the money paid for them were gifts to 
the ministry 
earlier in the trial the prosecution presented several ptl 
partners who said they sometimes were turned away when they tried 
to use their lodging benefits prosecutors contend bakker pocketed 
37 million of proceeds to fund his lavish lifestyle 
on friday us district court judge robert potter said bakker 
did not have proof to back up his calculations that there was room 
for 211062 lifetime partners the judge refused to allow a chart 
displaying the calculations to be presented to the jury 
bakker faces 120 years in prison and fines of more than 5 
million if found guilty on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy 
the evangelist often responded to prosecutors questions by 
saying he could not recall had not been informed or that he 
believed what he told television viewers 
when bakker said he could not recall getting a 50000 christmas 
bonus in 1986 smith said had your lifestyle become so 
extravagant that you wouldnt have noticed a 50000 bonus 
i did not look at my checkbook for several years bakker 
said 
bakker also testified that fund raising at the ministry became a 
nightmare 
i think fund raising was my most burdensome job he said 
it never left me you never ever ever get away from the 
pressure that you have to raise funds for next week next month 
next year he said 
bakker who was briefly hospitalized during the trial after he 
was reported to be suffering from hallucinations took the stand 
after his lawyers had presented more than 70 witnesses in his 
defense 
neither his wife tammy faye nor his two children were in the 
courtroom 
in a low voice bakker described the roots of his ptl ministry 
which he resigned in a sex and money scandal in 1987 he then 
described his vision to build the 2400acre heritage usa 
bakker testified that he had confidence in god to supply 
money for heritage usa when he left ptl he said the ministrys 
budget was 160 million a year which i think boils down to 3 
million a week 
he also described his supervision of ptls television network 
the inspirational network when i left ptl it was the largest 
christian network in the world he said 
tv is the most powerful medium in the world today he said 
at another point i felt the message of jesus christ should be 
propagated over that medium

misdemeanor counts on friday 
from the start her curbside arrest and handcuffing on june 14 
for slapping motorcycle policeman paul kramer miss gabor couldnt 
believe she would be treated like common folk instead of the 
princess she insisted she was 
after all she said shes a hollywood glamor queen actress and 
housewife 
when she struck kramer in the slap heard round the world she 
asked who do you think you are kramer responded who do you 
think you are 
i am the daughter of a freedom fighter the flamboyant 
actress told reporters during her trial i am a horsewoman she 
frequently intoned i am a princess i am zsa zsa 
every girl should have one in 1978 was zsa zsas last film 
role other movie credits include moulin rouge boys night 
out and picture mommy dead 
television viewers are familiar with miss gabors frequent talk 
show appearances as one of the celebrity squares on hollywood 
squares and on the munsters reruns shell be on this 
seasons first episode of the munsters today 
miss gabor believed older than the 66 she claims has a 
cosmetics and jewelry business commands about 5000 for her tv 
appearances and has extensive real estate holdings 
she pulled out all the stops throughout her trial drawn to 
microphones as if they were diamonds 
she blasted the prosecutors napoleon complex insulted gays 
and lesbians dismissed witnesses as punks or drug users and 
pulled courtroom antics that ranged from sobs and laughter to 
stomping out of court in a huff

gabor as a spoiled aristocrat who didnt know the meaning of truth

said she was going to europe 
when the jury began deliberations the prosecutor said he was 
offended by the behavior of the media reporters converged daily on 
the unpredictable miss gabor for her latest observation

symbiotic relationship between the media and the defendant in this 
case its sort of like they feed on each other 
miss gabor said in the first week of her trial that she was 
afraid to go to jail because jails are filled with lesbians the 
controversy lingered throughout the trial with miss gabor 
attempting to clarify the remark and insisting she didnt mean to 
offend gays 
she also talked often about that gorgeous officer kramer 
but didnt conceal her dislike for him 
hes a vulgar policeman and hes a liar she said i 
should have scratched his eyes out i think that cop is not too 
bright i think he must be very spoiled because hes very sexy 
hes gorgeous hes sexy but i dont like that man 
kramer was hospitalized during the trial after crashing his 
motorcycle into a police car while chasing suspects through beverly 
hills miss gabor suggested the crash was a staged sympathy ploy 
miss gabors husband who told a reporter it would be ok to 
call him prince or freddy got into a spat with the actress over 
her constant reference to kramer as gorgeous miss gabor slapped 
her husbandprince and broke his glasses

us justice department officials say grand jury 
indictments of five reputed members of a neonazi skinhead 
group are a warning that lawmen are giving highest priority to 
crushing crimes of hatred 
the indictments involved allegations of vandalism at a jewish 
temple and the jewish community center in dallas and attacks 
against blacks and hispanics at robert e lee park the alleged 
attacks occured last summer and fall officials said 
james p turner acting assistant attorney general in the 
justice departments civil rights division in washington announced 
the indictments on friday four of the five men are in custody 
federal authorities said 
the five belong to a dallasbased group called the confederate 
hammerskins officials said 
the skinhead subculture emerged in london in the 1960s segments 
of the movement took on nazi overtones in 1985 and since have been 
supported by and associated with the white supremacist aryan youth 
movement and white aryan resistance 
these indictments involve interference with basic civil rights 
because of a persons race religion national origin or ethnic 
background turner said racial hate crimes are crimes against 
the very idea of american freedom and democracy 
turner added that president bush and attorney general dick 
thornburgh have made it clear that these prosecutions of this type 
rank right up there with the war on drugs as a federal law 
enforcement priority 
the indictments bring to 16 the number of confederate 
hammerskins associates charged in the grand jury investigation that 
began in february following months of hate crimes in north texas 
and surrounding areas seven have pleaded guilty to charges in 
connection with violence last summer and fall 
the white supremacy group first appeared in dallas less than two 
years ago when sean christian tarrant one of the defendants 
formed the hammerskins 
the threecount indictment names tarrant jon lance jordan 
michael lewis lawrence christopher barry greer and daniel alvis 
wood it alleged two separate conspiracies to commit acts of 
violence 
each of the two charges carries a maximum sentence of 10 years 
imprisonment and a 250000 fine 
lawrence jordan and wood also were charged with using a firearm 
in a violent crime 
jordan remained at large saturday said barry kowalski an 
attorney with the justice departments civil rights division 
mark briskman dallas regional director of the bnai brith 
antidefamation league said he believes that the federal 
prosecutions will drive a stake into the heart of the vampire 
i think that this sends a very clear message to bigots and the 
organized hate community that these kinds of activities are not 
going to be tolerated he said

the death of ferdinand e marcos was expected to 
be the end of a saga for his followers but they say its turning 
into the beginning of another one when and where hell be buried 
president marcos death is not the end of the story for me 
said aide arturo aruiza a colonel in the philippine army who 
advised marcos for more than 20 years my job is with the 
president now i must stay with his body 
long before the chronically ill former philippines president 
died of cardiac arrest thursday at the age of 72 the 20 or so 
members of his staff were pondering life without him 
some such as aruiza hoped to return to the philippines others 
are seeking residency in the united states or staying on with 
marcos widow imelda 
but now with the fate of marcos body uncertain many employees 
said they had put their plans on hold 
what will i do ill wait for my appeal said spokesman 
leoni tan who has appealed an immigration judges denial of his 
request for political asylum here it looks like ill have plenty 
to do for maam he said referring to mrs marcos 
marcos corpse has been lying in a bronze casket in the living 
room of the family home since thursday hundreds of people have 
viewed the body with the novena to continue through friday 
there are no plans for burial mrs marcos says its the only 
way to ensure it would return to the philippines if the opportunity 
arises 
my plan has always been to bring him back she said i 
have committed myself to what is ferdinands right to rest in peace 
in his motherland 
initially president corazon aquino said marcos return even 
dead could destabilize the administration shes headed since a 
popular revolt ousted marcos in 1986 
but later mrs aquino softened her rhetoric slightly saying 
she might consider the return later if political conditions were 
right she also said she might consider allowing mrs marcos and 
her three children to return 
there is nothing that would prohibit the temporary display of 
a body in a private home if it does not create a health hazard or a 
nuisance hawaii attorney general warren price said a court 
ruling might be required to define temporary he added 
neighbors in the usually tranquil neighborhood of makiki heights 
hope marcos is buried somewhere soon 
we dont mind an appropriate memorial service two weeks is 
fine two years is too long said john steelquist chairman of 
the neighborhood board 
steelquist said the neighborhood was worried marcos would end 
up like his mother dona josefa edralin who died in the 
philippines in may 1988 but has never been buried because marcos 
could not return to preside over the funeral 
several promarcos filipino arrived friday to pay their 
respects others such as joan still a tourist from cleveland 
tenn visited out of curiosity 
mrs marcos was very warm i offered my prayers and she 
thanked me for coming mrs still said i feel like he did 
wrong but maybe he asked god to forgive him 
in the philippines officials said marcos death might encourage 
his family and former associates to settle claims made by the 
philippine government out of court to avoid costly legal battles 
marcos attorney john bartko said the family remains anxious to 
resolve the dispute since it could allow their return to the 
philippines however he said there were no plea bargaining talks 
taking place regarding mrs marcos us criminal case 
mrs marcos pleaded innocent in a new york court to federal 
racketeering charges alleging she and her husband stole nearly 200 
million from their impoverished country and stashed it in the 
united states 
a lawyer for the philippines said a 5 billion civil fraud and 
racketeering lawsuit brought against marcos in los angeles would go 
forward

hours after president wojciech jaruzelski 
nominated the east blocs first noncommunist prime minister 
romanias leader proposed warsaw pact action aimed at defending 
socialism documents show 
the documents published friday in the polish press said 
romanian president nicolae ceausescu summoned polands ambassador 
at midnight aug 19 and told him as a communist party a 
socialist country we cannot consider this an internal affair of 
poland alone 
in a response sent to romania after the meeting the polish 
communist party rejected romanias protest as unfounded and an 
unjustified attempt at undermining our countrys credibility as 
an ally a document said 
two documents one appearing to be a polish diplomatic report 
about the incident and the second the response of the communist 
polish united workers party were published by the prosolidarity 
gazeta wyborcza newspaper they were picked up by the polish news 
agency pap 
polands communist party criticized publication of the documents 
on aug 19 jaruzelski nominated solidarity journalist tadeusz 
mazowiecki as prime minister czeslaw kiszczak had resigned from 
the post after a futile threeweek effort to form a communistled 
government 
making it possible for solidarity to come to power is 
discordant with the scientific revolutionary concept of socialist 
construction and serves the most reactionary circles said a 
statement read to polish ambassador jerzy wozniak in bucharest by 
romanian communist party secretary ion stojan 
romanian communists turned that same night to leaders of the 
other warsaw pact communist parties to express grave concern and 
to jointly act in favor of preventing a serious situation in 
poland in favor of defending socialism and the polish nation 
pap said 
there was no indication what type of united action ceausescu 
envisioned a similar justification was used in the 1968 invasion 
of czechoslovakia in which soviet bloc troops crushed the prague 
spring reforms of alexander dubcek romania was the only member 
of the bloc that did not join the invasion 
the late soviet leader leonid brezhnev had invoked the brezhnev 
doctrine allowing moscow to intervene militarily if the kremlin 
considered communism in danger in other warsaw pact countries 
warsaw pact countries did not move to interfere with 
mazowieckis government soviet leaders said the naming of the new 
government was a matter of internal polish politics

the cockpit voice recorder shows the pilots while conducting a 
preflight checklist found the cockpit gauge showed the rudder was 
properly centered the new york times reported in today editions

the national transportation safety board earlier this week said 
the trim actuator operated from the cockpit and which helps 
position the rudder had been found in the extremeleft position 
on the wreck

him to take over the controls from the copilot and abort the 
takeoff

the collision between an amtrak train and a 
firetruck was the third in five years at a rural crossing but one 
official said the crash that killed two firefighters was 
unavoidable 
state and federal investigators declined to speculate on the 
cause of thursday evenings wreck but they said there was no sign 
the train crew was at fault 
there is no indication that there was any improper action on 
the part of the trains crew that in any way led to the accident 
amtrak spokesman michael stewart said 
the amtrak crescent carrying 379 passengers and a crew of 20 
was en route from new york to atlanta and new orleans when it

are investigating the accident in which 12 of the trains 16 cars 
and two locomotives derailed 
the track was reopened friday afternoon 
a preliminary investigation by amtrak showed the train was 
traveling at 77 mph at the time of the collision just below the 
speed limit of 79 mph stewart said 
local authorities said it was the third collision in five years 
at the crossing on a private road near virginia 28 the previous 
two did not cause any injuries 
the crash highlighted the danger of the crossing authorities 
said there is a railroad crossing sign at the junction but no 
crossing bar or warning light 
it was an unavoidable accident fauquier county deputy 
sheriff robert mosier said the crossing sits on a steep grade 
so the driver couldnt stop to look he had his lights on and the 
siren running next to his ear not to mention the sound of the 
trucks motor 
state police spokeswoman lucy caldwell said the firetruck 
carrying five firefighters was responding to a report of a car fire 
near a home on the other side of the tracks 
stewart said the train sounded its horn when it approached the 
crossing 
firefighters mark miller 23 the driver of the truck and matt 
smith 22 the frontseat passenger both of catlett died at the

a lawyer for neighbors of the fernald uranium 
processing plant says he hopes a judges approval of a 78 million 
settlement leads to early monitoring of health risks in the area 
if early detection of cancer saves even one life its worth 
it said stanley chesley who led lawyers for 14000 plaintiffs 
in the 4yearold classaction lawsuit 
us district judge s arthur spiegel filed an order friday 
saying he found fair and reasonable a settlement to the suit 
offered by the us department of energy owner of the feed 
materials production center the settlement will support longterm 
medical studies of residents within five miles of the plant 
the 38yearold facility located 18 miles northwest of 
cincinnati processes uranium for use in nuclear reactors and 
weapons 
the energy department offered june 30 to settle a 300 million 
claim by neighbors who said radioactive pollution from the plant 
inflicted emotional suffering and reduced their property values 
spiegel ruled that the settlement is limited to those two issues 
chesley has said lawyers expect medical monitoring to last 30 to 
40 years and track such ailments as lung cancer and kidney disease 
claims by individual residents were certified as a classaction 
lawsuit in september 1986 
spiegel rejected the governments contention that the settlement 
protects the energy department from claims by neighbors for the 
cost of cleaning up radioactive contamination of their property he 
said the neighbors are free to file such claims 
henry gill jr the energy departments chief lawyer in the 
case declined to comment friday from his washington office saying 
he had not seen the judges order 
spiegel dismissed objections to the settlement by ruetgersnease 
chemical co and delta steel corp commercial neighbors of the 
fernald plant spiegel ruled that the companies lack legal standing 
to object to the settlement because they dont own the property on 
which they operate in the fivemile radius set as a requirement for 
participation in the lawsuit 
william kennedy a lawyer for ruetgersnease also declined 
comment from his philadelphia office saying he hadnt seen 
spiegels order 
spiegel appointed three people to serve as courtsupervised 
masters and trustees to oversee implementation of the settlement

despite optimism over prospects for a superpower 
treaty to cut longrange nuclear weapons the chief us delegate 
said hundreds of disagreements must still be resolved 
talks on the treaty resumed friday and ambassador richard burt 
told reporters after a oneonone meeting with his soviet 
counterpart yuri nazarkin that the spirit of jackson hole has 
moved to geneva 
he referred to last weekends talks in wyoming between secretary 
of state james baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze those meetings ended with senior aides on both sides 
saying a strategic arms reduction treaty was within reach 
burt said however his team must read the fine print of the 
soviet proposals that prompted the optimistic assessments 
detailed negotiations begin monday with a full meeting of both 
delegations 
the new round of talks is the 12th since negotiations began in 
march 1985 
asked about prospects for completing the treaty by the 
superpower summit scheduled for late spring or early summer next 
year burt replied that it would be a major mistake for us to 
negotiate against an artificial deadline 
he said shevardnadzes remarks in wyoming apparently mean 
that moscow dropped its linkage between a treaty and an accord on 
defense and space issues 
the soviets said in wyoming that they would drop a demand that 
the united states curb work on a spacebased missile defense 
program before a treaty on longrange missiles is completed 
we need to understand very clearly what the soviets are and 
are not proposing here burt said 
he made plain that washington was not enthusiastic about the 
soviet offer to take the issue of submarinelaunched cruise 
missiles out of a treaty the united states does not believe these 
missiles can be effectively monitored he said 
we have heard some soviet ideas and as secretary baker has 
said our first reaction is positive our job here is to read the 
fine print and fully understand what the soviets are telling us 
the draft treaty text covers more than 450 pages he said 
there are hundreds of disagreements on a range of issues some 
of them are big important questions and some are small technical 
disputes burt said

three more ethnic groups in the east bloc gained 
representation in the pen international writers association and 
soviet delegates attended the associations meeting for the first 
time 
concluding its weeklong congress friday pen accepted ukrainian 
czech and slovak chapters as members 
a 65year quarrel ended in may with the admission of the first 
chapter from the soviet union based in moscow pen had kept out 
the soviet union citing that countrys persecution of writers and 
other intellectuals moscow had regarded the authors group as 
anticommunist 
for the first time two soviet delegates from the moscow chapter 
attended the canadian congress held in toronto and montreal 
the ukrainian chapter will be based in kiev in the soviet 
ukraine but based on language will accept ukrainian writers from 
anywhere mykola vingranovsky its representative said in a 
statement that the chapter will work to keep the ukrainian language 
alive in modern life 
a lithuanian chapter also was admitted in may to join latvian 
and estonian chapters that existed in exile 
pens international secretary alexander blokh said the baltic 
chapters are not considered part of the soviet union for pens 
administrative purposes 
it is not a country that is represented it is a literature 
he said in an interview 
the czech chapter dormant since the 1968 soviet intervention 
was reactivated and the new slovak chapter was recognized 
separately at its request 
czech playwright vaclav havel a rights activist sentenced to 
nine months imprisonment in february said in a message to the 
congress that the separation was in the interest of both 
literatures no matter how close they might be 
czechoslovakia denied havel a passport he was represented by an 
empty chair thursday at a discussion to which he had been invited 
bulgarian hungarian polish and east german chapters also exist 
while pen expressed cautious optimism about the new contacts it 
expressed concern about threats to freedom of expression in the far 
east 
thomas von vegesack chairman of the international pen writers 
in prison committee told the congress we have had a long long 
list of writers and journalists who have been jailed in china 
he said the latest word was 33 new cases of writers imprisoned 
in china since the prodemocracy demonstrations 
a resolution passed this week said pen was appalled by the 
events of tiananmen square and reports of torture routinely used 
against those arrested 
von vegesack reported that his committee had a list of 358 cases 
throughout the world with 78 people released and 127 new cases 
since march 
this is the highest figure the committee has had on its list 
in five years he wrote 
he noted that before glasnost europe was the continent with the 
most cases today most of our new cases are in the far east 
he wrote 
von vegesack told reporters he knew of 41 writers and 
journalists arrested in south korea 
a resolution passed by pen said it was distressed by reports of 
the disappearance of dissidents and asked the burmese 
government to cease what pen views as the persecution of writers 
pen founded in 1921 has about 11000 members in more than 90 
chapters organized along language lines it is an international 
association of poets playwrights editors essayists and novelists 
the association is holding its convention in canada for the 
first time the canadian englishspeaking chapter acted as host in 
toronto the group then traveled to montreal on wednesday where the 
frenchspeaking chapter was host 
a pen resolution expressed anxiety that a possible 
plebiscite on puerto ricos political future as drafted up to now 
ignores the linguistic and cultural reality of the puerto rican

showed goddard had the support of 54 percent of the citys 
registered voters with only 10 percent for republican party 
chairman burton kruglick the strongest opponent about 32 percent 
were undecided 
the son of former gov sam goddard who heads the state 
democratic party the 42yearold mayor burst onto the political 
scene early in the decade when he led successful campaigns against 
a state gasoline tax and for district elections for city council 
members 
first elected mayor in 1983 goddard has gained national stature 
in recent months as president of the national league of cities 
but his challengers kruglick and norris inman a real estate 
broker claim goddard has supported grandiose plans that taxpayers 
neither want nor can afford 
kruglick 64 said his research showed nearly half the voters 
felt that the city had no direction was too political and was 
highhanded 
goddard scoffs at the idea of a voter backlash 
there are a few people who want to stand up on a street corner 
and shout but believe me most people i talk to are neutral or 
very enthusiastic about what weve done he said recently 
the city election is legally nonpartisan but kruglick 
recently endorsed by president bush maintains that a republican 
challenger was needed because goddard is a highprofile democrat 
with designs on the governors office 
inman who never has held public office was defeated by a 21 
margin in his only other campaign a bid for the city council in 
1987 
goddards support for a proposed amphitheater in a northwest 
phoenix neighborhood that wanted no part of it was defeated when 
the city council rejected the proposal 
a proposition on tuesdays ballot would prohibit future councils 
from spending more than 3 million for amphitheaters or sports 
arenas without voter approval 
goddard also was on the losing side when voters resoundingly 
defeated multibilliondollar proposals to expand the 
masstransportation system and to develop the dry salt river bed 
through phoenix 
goddard supports city financing of a downtown baseball stadium 
another issue on the ballot 
voters will decide whether the city should spend no more than 
100 million toward the cost of either a footballbaseball stadium 
or a baseballonly stadium if the measure is approved property 
taxes would be raised a maximum of 10 cents per 100 valuation

a middle school principal who says he put boxing 
gloves on two brawling eighth graders to let them blow off steam 
and avoid suspension has himself been suspended by irate 
administrators 
principal frank romero said last weeks boxing match followed a 
spate of fights between the two students over the past month the 
brief bout was a healthy and therapeutic release of aggression 
designed to keep them from being suspended from stockard middle 
school in dallas he said 
but his superiors in the dallas independent school district said 
the 27year educator violated discipline policies by allowing the 
fight they suspended him for six days with pay 
romero said he was told after the fight that district policies 
required him to paddle the students or suspend them not let them 
box but he was unrepentant 
theres nothing in the policy books that says you cant have 
the kids box he said im not trying to hurt kids im trying 
to save kids its easy to expel them but its difficult to keep 
them in school after that 
at a school board meeting this week five parents rallied to 
defend the principal who has been recognized for having rid the 
school grounds of drug dealers 
i think what he did was right pta president sarah vargas 
said 
chad woolery assistant superintendent for secondary education 
declined to comment on romeros suspension except to say it 
involved questions over following policies 
romero 56 said he feared a recent rash of fights between the 
two boys would escalate into a gang war he said two assistant 
principals and a teacher witnessed the afterschool boxing match 
sept 20 
i brought them into the office and they had another fight in 
the office as soon as we turned our backs he said i asked 
them if they wanted to box they said yes 
both boys began boxing with regulation gloves for what was 
supposed to be two rounds of two minutes each but they tired in 
less than a minute romero said both 14yearolds displayed a 
changed attitude immediately he said 
they shook hands they hugged their dignity was not marred 
said romero who will return to work monday

lebanese legislators who have survived 
a 14yearold civil war gathered today for peace talks but they 
divided over the deployment of syrian forces and moslem demands for 
greater political power 
king fahd in an opening address read by foreign minister prince 
saud al fasisal called on the christian and moslem lawmakers to 
set aside their differences and end fighting that has killed more 
than 150000 people 
now that the situation has shifted from the arena of warriors 
to the negotiators table it is high time we moved from trading 
artillery shells and accusations to hasten the peacemaking the 
kings message said 
fahd is a member of a threenation committee mandated by the 
22member arab league to end the bloodletting and reconcile 
lebanons feuding factions 
an arab leaguesponsored peace plan included a sept 22 
ceasefire that ended the latest round of fighting between syrian 
forces and christian army units under gen michel aoun who heads 
the christian cabinet more than 920 people have died in the last 
six months of intensive shelling in lebanon 
fahd king hassan ii of morocco and president chadli bendjedid 
of algeria formulated the sevenpoint peace plan that includes a 
national reconciliation charter of political reforms that the 
lebanese parliamentarians will debate 
the fahd speech delivered at the conference palace in this 
mountain resort said the blueprint is a realistic and practical 
basis for a solution to the conflict that broke out in 1975 
the taif meeting is the first by lebanons parliament outside 
the country 
by holding the talks on neutral ground the arab league has 
sought to reduce sectarian pressures on the legislators which have 
been a major factor in the collapse of earlier initiatives 
the fahd message to the parliamentarians said the night of 
lebanons tragedy has gone on much too long and the dawn will 
come sooner or later the decision is up to you lebanon and all 
lebanese will be the winners if you agree among yourselves the 
world is closely following your historic meeting 
some of the lebanese deputies who arrived in taif late friday 
said the meeting would last threeto10 days 
conference sources said 63 of lebanons 73 surviving legislators 
33 christians and 30 moslems were attending the taif 
conference three shiite moslem and seven christian deputies failed 
to show up 
no one has refused to come but some gave medical reasons for 
not attending saud said 
twentyfive of the deputies in the 99seat parliament have been 
killed or died of natural causes since the last elections in 1972 
another seat was held by amin gemayel whose sixyear term as 
president expired on sept 22 1988 the war has prevented 
elections since then and lebanon has no head of state 
christianmoslem differences split the government into the rival 
camps 
before the deputies left the lebanese capital beirut on friday 
lebanons acting prime minister salim hoss said the taif meeting 
could be the last chance for peace in lebanon 
parliament speaker hussein husseini told reporters upon arriving 
in taif we are determined to reach a unified concept on the 
issue of political reform to achieve national reconciliation 
while agreeing to the meeting christians said they would not 
discuss political reform unless syria agreed to a timetable for 
withdrawing its 40000 troops from lebanon they arrived under a 
1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate but soon allied with moslem 
militias in fighting the christians 
syria has said it will not consider a withdrawal until a united 
government emerges in lebanon and the moslems are given a larger 
share of power in constitutional reforms 
the proposed reforms call for lebanons maronites the dominant 
christian sect to surrender the privileges they have held since 
independence from france in 1943 they would share power equally 
with the countrys moslems 
in 1943 the christians were considered the majority but 
moslems now comprise an estimated 55 percent of lebanons 4 million 
people 
the latest outbreak in fighting began in march when aoun 
blockaded illegal militiarun ports saying they deprived the state 
of more than 100 million yearly in lost revenues the 
syrianmoslem alliance responded by blockading the 310squaremile 
christian enclave in and around beirut

flower arrangements 
in past years the square teemed with people admiring the 
displays and posing for souvenir snapshots this year however 
only groups who have permission are allowed into the square 
tiananmen has been closed to the general public since june 34 
when troops shot their way into the capital to crush the popular 
prodemocracy movement and retake tiananmen from the students 
this morning thousands of people including foreign tourists and 
lowlevel officials from the countryside arrived at the square in 
a caravan of buses kindergarten children played games amid the 
flower arrangements while men flew long kites in the warm autumn 
breeze 
rows of red flags fluttered in the square and atop the landmarks 
that border tiananmen the great hall of the people the wall of 
the forbidden city and the history museum

her classmates practicing in large circles in the field below said 
the dancers were selected on the basis of their dancing ability and 
political purity 
but nearly the entire school was involved in the sevenweek 
prodemocracy movement and the student who did not give her name

participated in the movement

noncommunist guerrillas said 
they launched a major offensive in cambodia that captured two towns 
and 10 other positions from the provietnamese government 
the claim came soon after vietnam said its last troops had 
pulled out of cambodia where they fought the guerrillas for more 
than a decade the battle is now being waged by soldiers of the 
government vietnam installed 
also today a vietnam news agency report monitored in bangkok 
thailand said cambodias government in phnom penh plans to hold 
general elections at the end of the year whether or not a political 
solution to the insurgency is found 
a spokesman for the khmer peoples national liberation front 
abdulgaffar peangmeth said 5000 guerrilla fighters attacked five 
towns and other positions along highway 69 which parallels 
cambodias western border 
gen dien del acting commander of the front said his fighters 
knocked out tanks overran 10 army positions flanking the highway 
and seized a district capital thmar puok the vietnamese army left 
that town six days ago 
at the town of banteay chmar which dien del said was also 
seized the front captured a warehouse with 1000 weapons he said 
dien del said the attackers sustained light casualties and 
inflicted heavy losses on cambodias forces estimated at 4500 
soldiers he said one sovietbuilt t54 tank was destroyed two 
disabled and a fourth captured 
his claims could not be independently verified 
our intention is to test the strength of the government of 
president heng samrin and force phnom penh to the negotiating 
table the general said 
a western diplomat said that if true the fall of thmar puok 
would be a major victory for the front 
a western relief official based in the border town of 
aranyaprathet said heavy shelling could be heard near the key 
border town from early morning 
he said the fronts vast refugee camp of site 2 30 miles to the 
north was closed to relief workers for fear of possible 
retaliation by government gunners site 2 is the largest camp on 
the border housing 140000 people 
we will know more in the next couple of days the relief 
official said at the moment it is difficult to judge how much is 
true and how much is propaganda he spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the general also discussed the assault on sisophon located at 
the junction of highways 69 and 5 and at the southern end of the 
38milelong and 10to25mile deep area the front says it is 
attacking 
he said sisophon was listed as among the five major objectives 
of the offensive and was attacked for psychological warfare 
reasons 
he said there would be no attempt to capture it earlier front 
officers said their troops had already entered sisophon the 
northernmost town is banteay chmar the other targeted towns are 
svey chiek and kandoun 
the diplomat said the front may have timed the push with drives 
by its guerrilla coalition partners the communist khmer rouge and 
a group loyal to resistance leader prince norodom sihanouk in 
other areas along the thaicambodian border 
the front claims to have 16000 fighters the strongest 
guerrilla group the khmer rouge fields up to 40000 according to 
western estimates 
vietnam which invaded cambodia and ousted the khmer rouge in 
late 1978 said it completed withdrawal of its troops on tuesday 
but the guerrillas say thousands of vietnamese have stayed behind 
some diplomats say the poorly trained and equipped cambodian 
army may not be able to beat back the guerrillas without vietnamese 
support 
the khmer rouge has recently claimed a series of battle 
successes against cambodian army units which they say were 
supported by vietnamese troops

senate votes to bar counting of illegals in census 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the census bureau would be barred from 
counting illegal aliens in next years census under a measure 
approved by the senate in a decision that could affect the 
redrawing of congressional districts 
an occupying army would qualify for being counted in the 
census under current rules sen orrin hatch rutah said friday 
as the senate approved the legislation on a voice vote and attached 
it to a 173 billion money bill for the commerce state and 
justice departments 
a move to table or kill the measure was defeated 5041 
the 435 seats in the house of representatives will be 
reallocated among the states following the 1990 census with the 
most populous states as always getting the most seats 
thus lawmakers from states with few illegal aliens would like to 
see them omitted from next years count 
the measure sponsored by sen richard c shelby dala would 
bar the use of funds contained in the commerce department 
appropriation for counting the illegals in the census 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said some states would 
lose congressional seats because they have few illegals 
this policy simply does not make any sense dole said 
sen pete wilson rcalif said however that a number of 
urban areas are making sizeable expenditures on schools and health 
care because of their high concentration of illegal aliens federal 
aid to these areas would be decreased if they were not counted 
wilson said

the worlds biggest cocaine bust prompted 
renewed calls for more antidrug aid to southern california which 
the regions top federal narcotics agent called the cocaine 
capital of the united states 
the 20 tons of cocaine was worth 2 billion wholesale and could 
have brought up to 20 billion on the street if heavily diluted and 
sold in smokeable rocks authorities said friday 
that would be more than double the 94 billion the senate 
approved this week to fight the war on drugs next year and enough 
dope to provide the 3 million residents of los angeles a rock a 
day for three months 
authorities speculated that the huge size of the haul could 
indicate that colombias crackdown on drug lords may have forced 
them to combine their distribution networks 
the raid thursday night at a warehouse in a quiet 
lightindustrial area 25 miles northwest of downtown also yielded 
at least three arrests extensive records of dealers and at least 
10 million in cash stuffed in boxes 
in addition to the three men arrested in los angeles the las 
vegas sun reported today that three others were arrested by dea 
agents at an expensive las vegas hotel friday in connection with 
the drug seizure the men one of them a former mexican customs 
official were arrested for investigation of importation and 
distribution of narcotics the newspaper said 
dea night duty officers in los angeles and washington dc 
said they could not comment on the report and las vegas police 
said they had no information about any additional arrests 
ive been on this job for 25 years and ive never seen so 
much dope in one place i couldnt believe it said john m 
zienter the drug enforcement administrations special agent in 
charge for los angeles 
this narcotics seizure of the largest amount of cocaine in the 
world should put to rest any further speculation about whether or 
not los angeles has in fact become the cocaine capital of the 
united states zienter said 
dea administrator jack lawn said the seizure is an example of 
the tremendous magnitude of the cocaine problem throughout the 
united states 
but he and other officials in washington said it was unclear if 
most cocaine now enters the country through los angeles 
local officials renewed their call for more federal drug agents 
the los angeles dea office has 110 agents miami and new york have 
more than 300 each 
hey washington listen to us we need your help police 
chief daryl gates said we want you to send double the number of 
dea agents out here we need more customs and we need more border 
patrol 
mayor tom bradley said los angeles had beefed up its police 
force to the highest levels ever and still needed help 
the federal drug agents who uncovered this drug house should 
be applauded bradley said now its time for the government to 
send even more personnel to wage a winning war 
the 40000pound seizure packed in cardboard boxes easily 
topped the previous us record of about 8700 pounds in fort 
lauderdale fla in 1987 it also surpassed the world record a 
12ton seizure in colombia 
by comparison a total of 184 tons of cocaine was seized in 
miami in the nine months ended june 30 and 22 tons in los 
angeles dea spokesman frank shults said 
many mysteries remained including why so much cocaine from 
rival colombian drug cartels was found in the same warehouse 
the transporters were moving both cali and medellin dope 
dea spokesman ralph lochridge said thats unheard of in large 
shipments like this 
he speculated that colombias crackdown on drug lords might have 
forced the two former competitors to team up 
the two cartels could be forming an alliance to use on 
particular channels through the border he said it could be a 
sign of their trying to regroup from whats going on in colombia 
the three men arrested were to be arraigned monday on drug 
charges they were not identified and lochridge said that although 
they claimed to be mexican their accents were south american 
lochridge said more arrests were expected but he declined to 
elaborate 
drug agents said they were led to the warehouse by an 
unidentified person some reports said a witness saw trucks 
unloading at the warehouse 
the cocaine seized would have been distributed across the 
country by los angelesbased drug gangs said ira reiner los 
angeles county district attorney he added that the seized records 
offered a list of leads that was endless 
these arent just drug runners reiner said these are the 
major drug dealers they dont get any bigger than this until you 
get to colombia 
gates said the bust would dent the local narcotics traffic 
but the unfortunate part of it is it wont be a major dent 
that gives you some sense of the flow of narcotics coming in and 
how much work there is to be done in stopping that flow he said

an antipapal activist threatened today to disrupt 
the first visit to the vatican by the anglican church leader 
archbishop robert runcie 
the activist the rev ian paisley delivered a written protest 
about runcies trip shortly after the anglican leader held his 
second meeting at the vatican in two days with pope john paul ii 
if i spoil the party ill have done very well paisley told 
reporters as he gave the protest to the archbishops press 
secretary at the english college residence for seminarians where 
runcie is staying 
paisley is a northern ireland loyalist and head of the free 
presbyterian church in northern ireland which is vehemently 
antiroman catholic 
paisley who is also a member of the british and european 
parliaments refused to say what kinds of protests he planned 
during runcies fourday visit which ends monday 
last year paisley interrupted a speech by pope john paul to the 
european parliament by screaming i renounce you as the 
antichrist 
runcie spiritual head of the state church of england and leader 
of the worlds 70 million anglicans met for 55 minutes this 
morning with the pope head of 850 million roman catholics 
they were expected to discuss efforts to reunite the churches 
that split in the 16th century over the vaticans refusal to annul 
the marriage of henry viii and catherine of aragon 
no details were released about the talks which also involved 
runcies advisers and members of the pontifical council for 
promoting christian unity 
later today the pope and runcie were to pray together at 
vespers and deliver speeches touching on reunification efforts 
which have been troubled by the anglican churchs ordination of 
women 
in the letter to runcie made available to reporters paisley 
said your endeavor to deprotestantize the church of england and 
make it a mere annex of rome strikes at the constitutional liberty 
of the united kingdom and is destructive to the integrity of the 
throne the position of the queen and the protestant succession 
the letter accused runcie of high treason for the anglican 
leaders recent remarks that the church of england might recognize 
papal authority in a united church 
runcies statements on papal leadership echoed a view stated 
several years ago by a vaticananglican commission working on a 
framework for church unity 
nonetheless the comments drew fire from evangelicals in the 
church of england who base their teaching strictly on the bible 
and oppose unity with rome 
in a brief speech today runcie told john paul he was wearing a 
ring that was given by pope paul vi to anglican archbishop michael 
ramsey in 1966 he described it as a sign not unlike an 
engagement ring 
it is a token of commitment runcie said i wear it today 
as we rededicate ourselves to the search for visible and 
sacramental unity between anglicans and roman catholics throughout

as dr elizabeth morgan enjoys her first days 
of freedom after 25 months in jail in a bitter parental visitation 
rights battle her exhusband is stepping up efforts to locate 
their daughter 
im catching my breath now and im beginning to adjust to 
being out morgan says but things like the weather noticing 
the weather thats just one thing i couldnt do when i was in 
jail 
morgan 42 was jailed on civil contempt of court charges in 
august 1987 for failing to produce her daughter hilary for 
courtordered visits with dr eric foretich her 46yearold 
exhusband and the girls father 
morgan alleges that foretich sexually abused the girl now 7 
foretich who denies those charges claims that morgan is mentally 
ill 
hilary remains hidden at an undisclosed location and morgan has 
vowed that she will go without seeing her daughter until the girl 
turns 18 if necessary to protect her 
on wednesday foretich announced that he was establishing a fund 
to pay for efforts to search for his daughter and he once again 
called upon morgan to produce the child 
hilary is the ultimate loser in all of this foretich said 
i want to see her safe returned with her rights restored 
foretich says he is establishing the fund because the costs of 
his extensive legal battle with morgan and fees charged by previous 
private investigators have left him financially strapped he also 
claims that his oncethriving oral surgery practice has dropped 
off and he blames negative publicity surrounding the case 
morgan was freed on monday after president bush signed a bill 
designed to limit civil contempt of court jailings in district 
child custody cases the legislation moved at lightning pace 
through the house and senate as lawmakers responded to morgans 
plight with an urgency like that reserved for matters of national 
emergency 
but the bill contained a provision that calls for it to pass out 
of existence after 18 months which means morgan could wind up in 
jail again particularly if foretich makes good on his pledge to 
keep fighting for his visitation rights 
i would go back to jail morgan says not to be cavalier 
but after this experience i could do it again though of course i 
wouldnt want to 
after morgan was freed monday elaine mittleman foretichs 
attorney said future legal action against morgan is likely 
she remains in contempt of court and this law doesnt change 
that mittleman said thats not being vengeful thats just 
what the law is about 
meanwhile morgan has had her hair styled and been to the 
dentist since her release scheduling those mundane chores around 
interviews with scores of reporters 
she says she is restricted to the washington area for the next 
week because her fiance federal appeals court judge paul r 
michel has a heavy workload 
after that she says we plan to disappear to take some time 
together 
we both need that 
foretich in contrast can only plot his next legal move and 
hope that private investigators he has hired can come up with a 
clue to his daughters whereabouts 
he is also anxious like morgan to drop out of the harsh glare 
of public scrutiny 
i do not have any desire to be a media person foretich said 
at his press conference i would like to return to private life 
and i hope that this is once of the last times that i have to talk 
to you 
we need to get over this episode of heinous allegationsand 
get back to family love caring the things that are really 
important

shaken by a series of traumas culminating 
in the indictment of former premier andreas papandreou greece is 
careening toward elections in november with no political party 
clearly in control 
an unlikely alliance of conservatives and communists has been in 
charge since early july when voters ousted papandreous 
scandaltinged party but left no other group with enough votes to 
form a government 
since then the interim governing coalition has devoted nearly 
all of its time to cleaning up scandals from papandreous 
eightyear government the coalition shackled by fundamental 
disagreements over economic and foreign policy has been able to do 
little else 
conservative new democracy leader constantine mitsotakis the 
main power behind the government says the cabinet will resign oct 
6 and hold elections on nov 5 he said a caretaker cabinet will 
take the country into the elections 
mitsotakis has been pressing for quick balloting in the hope his 
party which won the most votes in the july balloting but was 
unable to form a government will win the majority in parliament 
the slaying of his soninlaw and conservative party spokesman 
pavlos bakoyannis by a shadowy leftist urban guerrilla gang on 
tuesday may strengthen mitsotakis bid 
the killing brought an outpouring of grief from all parts of the 
political spectrum it could help the 71yearold mitsotakis gain 
the support of many undecided voters who represent more than 10 
percent of the electorate 
papandreous situation should also help the conservatives he 
will have to campaign while under indictment and facing the 
possibility of imprisonment if found guilty by a special court of 
supreme court judges 
papandreou 70 former dean of the economics department at the 
university of california at berkeley before returning to greece to 
enter politics 26 years ago has denied any wrongdoing during his 
tenure as head of a panhellenic socialist movement government 
he is accused of authorizing a 210 million embezzlement at the 
bank of crete and of creating an illegal wiretapping network that 
monitored the phones of his political friends and foes 
the government has been cautious not to appear vindictive 
premier tzannis tzannetakis a new democracy deputy said in an 
interview with the liberal daily eleftherotypia it was not at all 
pleasant that the former premier would stand trial 
but what could we do certain things were discovered could 
we just let them go by 
in an address to parliament on wednesday papandreou said the 
charges were based solely on the testimony of the banks former 
chairman and owner george koskotas 
koskotas is in a us jail where he has been fighting 
extradition since he fled greece last november in interviews from 
prison he has charged that papandreou blackmailed him in 1987 into 
embezzling from the bank and funneling the money to the former 
premiers socialist party 
papandreou indicted along with four of his cabinet ministers 
has been silent since thursday but his spokesman telemahos 
hytiris said papandreou remained politically combative 
he will participate in the election campaign and believes 
sincerely that the results will be beneficial to his party 
hytiris said 
despite health and legal problems papandreou has made it clear 
he will not step down as the partys leader 
when he was still in office and under fire for his alleged role 
in scandals papandreous government spokesman said he would be 
president of his party for life papandreou told parliament 
wednesday that only he can guarantee the continuation and unity 
of the panhellenic socialist movement the business world has 
reacted with optimism despite the scandals and coming elections 
the stock market surged to a record high friday with a 10 percent 
increase during three days of trading 
the wretched performance of papandreou and his party in 
parliament and the conviction that new democracy will win an 
outright majority in the elections contributed to this said 
financial consultant constantine harokopos 
in contrast with papandreous socialist experiments and foreign 
policy new democracy advocates a free market policy and closer 
ties with nato and the united states 
the government announced in september that the public debt would 
represent 105 percent of the gross national product in 1989 and 
that servicing the 53 billion debt would cost more than a fifth of 
the gnp 
inflation is running at 15 percent almost four times the 
european community average 
mitsotakis has said that if his party wins a majority in the 
300member parliament he would negotiate a new defense agreement 
with the united states to maintain us military installations in 
greece he said he also would extradite suspected palestinian 
terrorist mohammed rashid to the united states 
a previous defense treaty has expired and the us bases must be 
removed by mid1990 unless a new agreement is reached 
rashids extradition has been approved by the greek supreme 
court but the final decision rests with the justice minister that 
post is held by leftist lawyer fotis kouvelis who has said he will 
not be responsible for such a decision 
the united states charges that rashid was responsible for the 
inflight bombing of a pan am jumbo jet over hawaii in 1982 a 
japanese teenager died in the blast and 15 other passengers were 
injured

vietnam and cambodia two 
nations joined by bloodshed and a border share the same 
aspirations for ending their isolation from the rest of the world 
in vietnam there is a fresh burst of optimism the government 
says its troops have finally ended a decade of fighting in 
cambodia and people here believe they may be entering the first 
period of peace in half a century 
in cambodia there is only more dying and a grim realization 
that the killing will probably intensify 
im happy that our troops have come home so no more of our 
soldiers will die said a sales clerk in a vietnamese store 
but im worried there may be more unrest in cambodia as a 
result 
cambodians fear a standoff between the three guerrilla groups 
and the forces of prime minister hun sen 
cambodian officials say phnom penh residents are stockpiling 
food because of worries that the khmer rouge the strongest of the 
guerrilla groups may cut supply lines to the capital as they did 
in 1975 when they encircled the city and overthrew the 
ussupported government 
its complex said a cambodian government technician in 
phnom penh whose older brother was killed by the khmer rouge im 
glad were taking responsibility for our own defense but im also 
nervous about what will happen 
in the long run however vietnams military pullout from 
cambodia could force a host of countries to reevaluate their 
policies toward indochina and lift hanoi and phnom penh out of 
years of diplomatic and economic isolation 
china and many western nations cut ties with vietnam after it 
invaded cambodia in late 1978 and removed the khmer rouge from 
power they refused to recognize the government vietnam installed 
in phnom penh 
during its 3year rule the khmer rouge murdered hundreds of 
thousands of people in an attempt to cleanse the old society 
and create a radical communist state 
evidence that all of vietnams troops have left cambodia would 
boost the growing credibility of the hun sen government and remove 
the chief reason that china thailand and other nations give for 
supporting the guerrilla coalition 
vietnam insists its last 26000 soldiers withdrew from cambodia 
on tuesday leaving only a few advisers but chinese and thai 
officials charge that thousands of vietnamese soldiers remain 
disguised as settlers or cambodian troops 
no internationally accepted group monitored the withdrawal 
because a conference in paris last month failed to agree on 
arrangements for a team of observers 
gen pat akkaniput of thailands supreme command says there are 
wellfounded suspicions of a continuing vietnamese military 
presence in cambodia 
let this game of withdrawal finish and then we will watch 
he said in a bangkok interview 
thailands position is crucial for the future of the guerrillas 
who are based along the thaicambodian border and armed largely by 
china thailand sees the khmer rouge as the main buffer between 
thailand and vietnamese forces 
pat said his nation will stop aiding the insurgents only after 
the vietnamese withdrawal is verified all outside military aid is 
halted and a ceasefire is called until then he said thai policy 
is to maintain military pressure on phnom penh while keeping 
communication open with hun sen open 
some analysts disagree with pats charge that vietnamese troops 
remain in camobodia 
they say vietnam is staking its credibility and its future 
economic growth on the claim of withrawal and that it is unlikely 
vietnam would do otherwise 
i frankly dont think it would be possible to send troops back 
because the vietnamese people would oppose it said a 
vietnamese foreign ministry official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity before troops could be sent by orders from the top 
but now too many people are against it 
in kuala lumpur malaysia on thursday vice president dan 
quayle called for increased support for prince norodom sihanouk and 
son sann leaders of the two noncommunist factions in the 
guerrilla coalition but declined comment on whether the united 
states had begun providing them with military assistance 
earlier in the week us state department officials said it was 
still too early to normalize relations with vietnam 
vietnamese leaders say supporters of the insurgents now should 
reduce their aid to the guerrillas 
we have created a favorable condition for a political 
settlement by withdrawing from cambodia said gen vo nguyen 
giap a key strategist during vietnams war with the united states 
now other countries must stop their military support 
vietnam says the khmer rouge forces numbered 170000 when it 
invaded cambodia in 1978 now it says the three guerrilla groups 
field a total of 50000 fighters including 17000 khmer rouge 
western analysts estimate 30000 to 40000 khmer rouge are 
facing 150000 cambodian government troops the khmer rouge are 
generally regarded as far better trained and more experienced than 
the government troops the guerrillas have little popular support 
however 
despite the resignation of khmer rouge leader pol pot from his 
last official post in june many believe he still holds power and 
that the group has not changed its murderous ways 
vietnam says 23000 guerrillas have entered cambodia from thai 
bases in recent weeks to launch an offensive near the gemmining 
region of pailin in western cambodia 
hun sen has acknowledged the insurgents have captured some 
territory in the area although heavy casualties have been reported 
in the fighting hun sen told reporters he did not see any 
possibility of pailin falling to the insurgents

the bush administration has offered to step up 
its military cooperation with the strategically located asian 
citystate of singapore pentagon officials say 
weve told them that were prepared to send a small number of 
fighter aircraft there on a temporary basis said a highlevel 
pentagon official who spoke on condition he not be identified by 
name 
singapore with a population of 26 million in an area about the 
size of chicago is positioned on one of the worlds most strategic 
waterways the strait of malacca with access to both the indian 
ocean and the south china sea 
the united states has strong economic ties with the increasingly 
influential nation which has a predominantly chinese financial 
center 
the us offer comes as the administration is preparing to enter 
potentially difficult talks with the philippines on extending the 
lease of six us military bases the pact is due to expire in 
september 1991 
president corazon aquino said thursday she has accepted 
president bushs offer to begin the talks but she said there can 
be no certainty the negotiations will produce agreement 
any agreement must be ratified by twothirds of the 23member 
senate where opposition is strong at least 12 senators have 
called publicly for the bases to be closed while others have 
demanded that us payments increase dramatically 
vice president dan quayle said during his visit there this past 
week that he was confident the two sides would reach agreement and 
guarantee the longtime involvement of the united states in the 
philippines 
the pentagon official stressed that the united states has no 
interest in replacing its philippine bases with those in singapore 
primarily because the facilities there are limited by the size of 
the tiny nation 
about 40000 american troops civilian employees and military 
dependents are stationed at the six us philippine installations 
including clark air base and the subic bay naval base 
singapore would make available facilities on a military base 
that is being vacated by new zealand the official said 
the united states would use the facilities to position aircraft 
there make ship calls and do some repair work the official said 
it would involve a small number of people 100 or less the 
official said 
the united states is aware that such a development is not 
necessarily desired by singapores neighbors malaysia and 
indonesia the official said 
however even the small amount of cooperation is expected to 
please the singapore government the official said 
its really not as much as they would like the official 
said 
singapore said publicly over the summer that it was interested 
in hosting the americans 
in june a military survey team visited the island and submitted 
a report to the joint chiefs of staff and other agencies on the 
feasibility of increased military cooperation 
the two nations have a military agreement allowing for us 
navy ships to make port calls and air force planes to refuel some 
joint military maneuvers have been held 
singapore has had a strong anticommunist heritage and is a 
staunch regional supporter of free enterprise its 1987 per capita 
income of 7400 ranks it 19th in the world

you now have just one year to cash your 
federal government check 
until now a government check was good indefinitely but a new 
law going into effect sunday requires recipients to cash their 
checks within 12 months 
americans are sitting on more than 25 billion of us 
government checks more than a year old according to andy 
montgomery a spokesman for the treasury departments financial 
management service 
there are nearly 6 million of those checks out there in 
boxes desk drawers attics you name it he said some are 
decades old 
the financial management services said that 427 pre1956 checks 
averaging 6542 were presented for payment during 1988 many of 
them it said were found by recipients or their estates who came 
to the service to determine whether the checks were still good 
the oldest check was issued to a woman in nebraska on april 15 
1919 for 101 in interest on world war i liberty bonds she was 
not identified 
the largest check was made out to a michigan man for 8606 in 
unspecified compensation on april 9 1954 the smallest was a 
2cent tax refund issued to a massachusetts man on april 19 1946 
to remind recipients of the new time limit for cashing 
government checks checks dated oct 1 and later will bear the 
phrase void after one year the new law also requires that 
checks written prior to oct 1 be cashed no later than sept 30 
1990 
the financial management service emphasized however the time 
limit does not affect the governments liability but if the time 
limit is exceeded the person holding the cancelled check will have 
to apply to the agency that wrote it for a replacement rather than 
just take it to a bank and cash it 
the new law also allows a oneyear period during which a claim 
involving a lost or stolen check may be filed 
at the same time the treasury department has 18 months to begin 
recovery from a financial institution of funds involving a forged 
or unauthorized check 
financial management service commissioner w e douglas said the 
new law brings the federal government more in line with business 
and local government practices 
not only is it a poor business practice to keep the 
governments books open forever it is also expensive to maintain 
the records he said and its the taxpayers who have to pick 
up that tab

hundreds of black and mixedrace 
people picnicked and swam at whitesonly beaches near cape town and 
port elizabeth today as clergymen declared that god meant the sand 
and water for everyone 
anglican archbishop desmond tutu wearing a yellow sunhat with 
the slogan free the beaches and a tshirt saying just call 
me arch confronted police who had initially ordered some of the 
crowd of 1500 to leave the beach in the conservative seaside town 
of strand 20 miles east of cape town 
some families left during the discussion but most stayed 
opening their picnic lunches swimming and wading in the water 
while 100 white people watched from the roadside police took no 
action 
i hope that the inhabitants of the strand will realize that we 
have liberated them tutu said they dont have to watch 
whether black people are walking on their beaches any longer they 
will enjoy the liberation of being able to share 
he said the black beachgoers were making sure they had staked 
their claim properly they walked around and wet their feet in 
gods water 
about 1000 people of all races gathered peacefully under heavy 
police supervision in port elizabeth in the eastern cape province 
dancing and singing as a sign was erected declaring the end of 
apartheid on pollock beach reserved for whites for about 35 years 
seven buses brought black people from townships 10 miles north 
of port elizabeth where the city council has asked that all 
beaches under its jurisdiction be desegregated the provincial 
administrator who is appointed by the national party government 
has refused 
former mayor graham richards erected the sign on a post in the 
sand while a crowd gathered to hear prayers speeches and poetry 
readings other black and white beachgoers swam and sat in the sun 
this mass nonracial picnic reminds us who we are that we are 
gods family it is human selfishness and greed that makes beaches 
for whites only said the rev david vika of the 
interdenominational ministers association 
the homemade sign in black lettering on a white background was 
made to look like the nearby municipal posts which declare the 
beach is for whites only but the new sign said we the people of 
port elizabeth hereby declare pollock beach open for the use of all 
people by order 
a magistrate gave permission for the port elizabeth 
demonstration which was planned to last all day but no approval 
was sought for the protest at the strand and police initially 
tried to stop the black and mixedrace families from getting to the 
beach 
police pulled their vans up on the sand and gave the people a 
few minutes to leave then took foreign television crews and local 
photographs away to a nearby police station where they were set 
free 
tutu told a news conference later he was afraid when police took 
the journalists away they planned to use force against the crowd 
tutu said that when thousands of blacks tried to get to the strand 
beach on aug 19 police used whips and dogs to drive them away 
police maintained a high profile standing on the beach and 
watching the crowds until the afternoon but many began smiling 
and waved as they left when the crowds thinned out according to 
the south african press association 
on friday 20000 antiapartheid demonstrators marched in 
southeastern king williams town to protest apartheid and police 
brutality no violence was reported during the demonstration which 
received official permission

lebanese lawmakers meeting in saudi 
arabia seek to end more than 14 years of civil war in their 
homeland a task that has defeated wouldbe peacemakers since 1975 
on the face of it the meeting between lebanons christian and 
moslem legislators appears to have as little chance of success as 
earlier efforts to end a war in which more than 150000 people have 
been killed 
the maronite catholics the main christian sect that has 
dominated the government since independence from france in 1943 
say they will not agree to political reforms until there are 
guarantees of a withdrawal by syrias 40000 troops in lebanon 
the syrians not party to the saudi arabian meeting but present 
in spirit say they will not pull out until the christians share 
power equally with the damascusbacked moslems 
the syrians entered lebanon in 1976 under an arab league mandate 
to quell the civil war they failed but have used that 
increasingly tattered mandate to justify staying in lebanon 
even if the legislators meeting under arab league auspices do 
reach agreement there are no guarantees that lebanons christian 
and moslem warlords will heed any accord 
to be sure the initiative the most intensive arab effort so 
far mounted to snuff out the civil war has achieved a ceasefire 
that halted six months of artillery battles between the syrians and 
christian forces led by gen michel aoun 
many lebanese are weary of a war that has dismembered their 
country but major obstacles that have been insurmountable in the 
past remain key lebanese leaders on both sides have criticized the 
arab leagues peace plan 
more significantly there are the regional powers who have 
repeatedly intervened in lebanon fanning the flames of war when it 
suited their purposes 
syria israel iran iraq libya and the palestinians have all 
turned lebanon into a proxy battleground for their feuds 
it is this gordian knot of foreign meddling as well as the deep 
rooted hostility among lebanons militia leaders that has stymied 
the peacemakers in the past leaving tiny lebanon prey to the wider 
strategies of more powerful states 
aoun isolated and outnumbered had little choice but to accept 
the ceasefire but believes there can be no peace while the 
syrians remain in lebanon 
he says he is prepared to make concessions but has pressured 
christian legislators to give nothing away until the arab league 
guarantees a syrian withdrawal something it has not been able to 
do 
syrian president hafez assad stubbornly determined to hold onto 
lebanon after a series of political setbacks that have undermined 
his prestige clearly stonewalled the arab league into not making a 
syrian withdrawal an issue 
it is glaringly obvious that the arab league statement does 
not even employ the word withdrawal in relation to future syrian 
troop movements said charles snow an analyst with the respected 
middle east economic survey 
in this as in virtually all its other proposals the 
initiative represents little more than an openended endorsement of 
syrias stated aims in lebanon 
syria long the main power broker in lebanon considers its 
neighbor to be vital to its strategic interests as a buffer on its 
vulnerable western flank against israel 
assad has also linked a withdrawal to a pullout by the israelis 
who occupy a border strip in south lebanon and to the return of 
the golan heights captured by israel in 1967 and later annexed 
all efforts to persuade the israelis to abandon these 
territories have failed and there is nothing to indicate that 
anything has changed 
iraq syrias archrival in the arab world has backed aoun for 
no other reason than to take revenge on assad for supporting iran 
during the eightyear iraniraq war and to bog down the syrians in 
the lebanese quagmire 
iraqi president saddam husseins objective is nothing less than 
undermining assads prestige in the arab world and within syria 
where he faces severe economic woes to bring him down 
aouns iraqi backers are doubtless willing to fight to the 
last maronite in lebanon to cripple assad snow commented 
saudi arabia a member of the threemember arab league committee 
mediating to end the lebanese carnage could pressure assad to back 
off because it is the only arab state still bankrolling radical 
syria 
but the saudis remain suspicious of saddams revived regional 
ambitions following the persian gulf ceasefire and look to syria 
as a counterweight 
druse moslem leader walid jumblatt has declared that the 
proposed reforms do not go far enough in stripping the maronites of 
their traditional powers 
the military battle is not yet over he declared 
nabih berri leader of the shiite moslem amal militia and a 
major syrian ally also says the proposed reforms are not 
enough because they envision splitting power equally between 
christians and moslems 
the 12 millionstrong shiites long downtrodden but now 
lebanons largest sect demand the greatest share of power 
syria has used its alliance with iran to put pressure on aoun 
tehran and damascus have publicly proclaimed solidarity but 
syria is a secular socialist state that has ruthlessly crushed 
islamic fundamentalist dissidents who have much in common with 
predominantly shiite iran 
the tehran times daily which often reflects the thinking of 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani stressed that syria must 
make sincere efforts to establish political justice in 
lebanon a clear statement of support for the shiites or fighting 
with vaster dimensions would erupt again 
the syrians must admit that there is a difference between 
fighting against zionism and imperialism and occupying a 
neighboring country it declared 
rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalled pragmatists apparently 
hopes to restore irans relations with the west and appears to be 
trying to rein in revolutionary radicals who back shiite militants 
in lebanon holding most of 16 western hostages 
the americans hope rafsanjanis emergence will herald the 
release of eight us captives and dont want to antagonize iran or 
syria much to aouns chagrin 
rafsanjani is supported by some lebanese shiites but the 
hardliners holding the hostages remain loyal to tehrans 
antiwestern radicals who could use them to keep lebanon on the 
boil to jeopardize rafsanjanis efforts

decision by us district judge charles r richey permitting 
citizens to sue the president to block destruction of the tapes is 
of extreme significance to the presidents ability to carry out 
his constitutional duties 
in addition department lawyers argued in the motion filed 
wednesday the decision has farreaching impact for the 
government as a whole because of the widespread use of computers 
making that determination for literally hundreds of thousands 
of computer entries is simply not feasible the department said 
at issue is whether such tapes might contain information that 
must be preserved under the presidential records act passed in 
1978 the white house maintains that it gave employes adequate 
guidelines to determine whether specific computer messages were 
important enough to be preserved as presidential records 
richey however said that at least some of the messages that 
had been slated for destruction may qualify for retention under 
the pertinent recordkeeping statutes 
the department is asking richey to have the decision sent 
directly to the us court of appeals instead of having further 
proceedings in the trial court which is hearing a lawsuit filed on 
the nexttolast day of the reagan administration 
the national security archives a washington nonprofit group 
that researches national security issues sued to prevent the 
scheduled destruction of 12 days worth of electronic messages in a 
system used by more than 300 employee in the national security 
council and other agencies of the executive office of the president 
investigators used such computer tapes to reconstruct evidence 
in the irancontra affair 
lawyers for the national security archives have said that if the 
appeal is not granted they will ask the white house to describe 
the general contents of the tapes through the legal process of 
discovery in preparation for a trial 
if the appeal is granted and the appeals court overrules richey 
the justice department said the parties would be spared the 
burden of unnecessary and particularly troubling discovery 
the department said the steppedup appeal process is 
especially appropriate because of the threat to the presidents 
authority 
requiring defendants to await a final decision after further 
prolonged litigation would be disruptive of the presidents 
ability to carry out his duties under the constitution the 
department said 
the department lawyers said that as far as they could find out 
this is the first case ever to consider whether the president is 
subject to suit under the administrative practices act as richey 
said he is 
the act has in the past been used to enable individuals to 
challenge arbitrary and capricious actions by agencies of the 
executive branch 
the justice department said in its motion that the plaintiffs in 
the case apparently seek to establish whether for each computer 
entry each individual employee faithfully applied statutory 
criteria to determine the record status of entries and then 
preserved record information 
other plaintiffs in the suit include the american library 
association the american historical association the center for 
national security studies of the american civil liberties union and 
several individuals 
the plaintiffs have until oct 9 to reply to the motion

a local television viewer wants so badly to 
see the last temptation of christ he is suing a cable company 
that decided not to show the controversial film 
felix h olim of suburban midwest city filed suit friday in 
federal court here to force multimedia cablevision to show the film 
on cinemax when it is telecast for the rest of the country he also 
wants 1 million in damages 
multimedia announced monday it would not telecast the last 
temptation in oklahoma kansas and north carolina when it appears 
on the premium channel 
the suit says multimedia infringed upon the religious rights 
of its 90000 subscribers by deciding to preempt the program 
whoever wishes not to view this or any transmission always 
has the option of choosing another channel or turning off his 
set olim said 
cinemax will broadcast the movie nationwide monday and on four 
other dates in october 
the oscarnominated last temptation sparked national 
protests when it was released 14 months ago because it portrayed 
jesus as confused over his identity and purpose and subject to 
human desires 
meanwhile oklahoma state university regents postponed a showing 
of the film by a student group on the stillwater campus while they 
attempted to decide if it is appropriate for a statefunded campus 
plans for the showing had prompted at least threat of violence 
an american civil liberties union attorney said the group would 
sue the university if the showing of the film is blocked and gov 
henry bellmon has told the regents it would be inappropriate to 
censor the film 
but state rep bill graves warned showing the film might violate 
a 1910 oklahoma law prohibiting blasphemy

quicker than robin could say holy copyright 
infringement batman counterfeit copies of the smash movie 
surfaced in thailands black markets 
although japan and hong kong have cracked down on video piracy 
the rest of asia remains the worlds hub for such counterfeits 
copyright experts said saturday at a seminar sponsored by the third 
tokyo international film festival 
video piracy the illegal taping of copyrighted videos cost the 
us film industry 740 million last year 
copyright experts and government officials from japan and hong 
kong reported recent successes in controlling video piracy within 
their borders 
but china where a videocassette recorder costs 22 times an 
average workers annual income is only now beginning to face the 
problem said dai qun director of the office of the film bureau 
china has 26000 theaters where videotapes are shown to the public 
it also has 26000 legitimate movie houses 
in thailand video piracy is uncontrollable because copyright 
laws are not enforced said lursak thavornvanit director of the 
thai intellectual property protection organization 
batman appeared on the thai black market just days after its 
us release he told an audience of 400 video makers and 
distributors 
its very difficult for anyone to do a legitimate business 
because the pirates are so good and so efficient at managing the 
market and no one can afford to pay for the legitimate tapes he 
said 
pirated videos which first appeared in 1983 have been 
illegally duplicated or dubbed either from legitimate copies or 
from movie or television screens they are sold or rented in video 
stores at a fraction of the cost of legitimate copies or shown in 
public places such as hotels and restaurants without payment to the 
copyright owners usually the films producers 
in tokyo a legitimate video tape rents for about 7 while a 
pirated copy costs about 2 nevertheless japans video watchdog 
group says the number of shops offering pirated videos has 
plummeted in the last two years 
between 60 percent and 70 percent of the 12000 video stores in 
japan sold pirated videos in 1987 but that number has declined to 
30 percent mostly because of tougher enforcement of copyright laws 
and a beefedup law that makes it illegal to possess pirated tapes 
said tomohiro tohyama legal director of the japan federation 
against copyright theft 
the criminal penalties under the revised copyright law are 
imprisonment for up to three years or a 7200 fine but no 
violators have ever gone to jail 
still tohyama thinks the law has been effective it is almost 
impossible to find a shop these days stocked 100 percent with 
pirated videos that wasnt true two years ago 
tohyama said his organizations main goal to halt all home 
taping of videos could take as long as 20 years the japanese 
public simply doesnt understand copying videos is stealing even 
though it is intangible property 
american movies are popular fare in japan the us film 
industrys largest export target last year almost three times as 
many us films were shown as japanese films according to the 
motion picture association of america 
the top four grossing films in japanese history are et 
star wars jaws and ghostbusters according to 
industry statistics 
elsewhere in asia rambo can be seen in isolationist burma 
and the last emperor was widely shown in china 
some south korean filmmakers are so threatened by the weighty 
competition of american movies that they allegedly ordered the 
release of snakes and tear gas into theaters showing us films 
videotapes of such us blockbusters a rambo smuggled in by 
boat through vietnams long coastline are popular black market 
items there

notwithstanding charges it is being too timid 
the bush administration is resisting calls for the united states to 
directly spend billions of dollars to aid polands historic attempt 
to transform its economy from communism to capitalism 
its not that president bush doesnt want the poles to succeed 
in an address last week to the 152nation international monetary 
fund and its sister organization the world bank bush hailed 
developments in eastern europe as stunning 
there is no greater opportunity before us all today than the 
challenge of poland he said 
we must do more he said 
on the other hand bush mentioned no specific figure for us 
aid beyond the 219 million already announced 
sen alan cranston dcalif called the presidents proposal 
pathetically timid and senate majority leader george mitchell 
dmaine said the administrations timidity is puzzling and 
dismaying 
bush is saying he wants to provide assistance to a newly 
reformed system but the bottom line is wheres the beef where 
is the money said joseph pelzman professor of economics at 
george washington university 
the president reportedly is considering additional us aid but 
the administration seems inclined to channel most western help 
through the imf and world bank 
the key word in bushs speech last week was we he was 
speaking to the world not just to americans 
the united states might kick in some more food aid from time 
to time and put aside some scholarships but in terms of cash aid 
its going to work through the world bank and imf said economics 
professor howard wachtel of american university 
a treasury official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
friday the bush administration believes that the world bank and 
imf have particularly important roles to play in supporting 
economic reform in poland both through policy advice and financial 
support 
academic experts on the subject say there are a number of 
advantages to this approach both political and budgetary 
it is a way to provide burden sharing and there is nothing 
wrong with that pelzman said 
western european democracies have as much if not more reason 
than the united states to help poland succeed 
another advantage lies in the technicalities of how the imf 
raises its money the fund assesses each member a quota which the 
countries supply from their reserves the quota can be withdrawn on 
demand so it doesnt count as spending for us budget purposes 
additional direct us aid unlike an increase in imf quotas 
would mean the administration and congress would have to cut 
elsewhere to meet the requirements of the grammrudman deficit 
reduction law 
indeed imf officials who are seeking agreement by the end of 
the year to double the funds resources from 120 billion to 240 
billion are hoping us desire to aid eastern europe will help 
persuade the united states to accede to a substantial quota 
increase 
but perhaps the most important factors in the administrations 
thinking are political both international and domestic 
if the united states charges too strongly into poland it could 
rattle the soviet union already nervous about the solidarityled 
government that took office aug 24 
also polish officials are beginning what at least initially 
will be a jarring reform program causing widespread unemployment 
and other disruptions as inefficient staterun enterprises are 
forced to operate in a competitive system for the first time 
the imf in exchange for its assistance normally insists that 
countries follow through on promised reforms it acts as sort of an 
international enforcer thats in line with what the united states 
wants but the administration is not eager for the flak that 
accompanies the tough cop role 
one of the reasons congress is so keen on aiding poland is the 
millions of americans of polish descent who closely watch 
conditions in their native land 
having the imf take the lead gives the united states political 
cover it puts the imf out front they take the flak if there are 
criticisms to be taken wachtel said 
you dont want to make the americans look as if they are the 
ones making the polish population eat less added pelzman 
but theres a danger in relying too much on international 
organizations more accustomed to dealing with third world countries 
with underdeveloped free enterprise systems than with centrally 
planned economies operating with no experience in free markets 
wachtel said 
the imf and world bank can make some very big mistakes if they 
simply parachute in their standard program where its not suited 
he said

secretary of state james baker iii is close to 
making his decision on the fate of the bugriddled us embassy 
building in moscow with one key option being to construct an annex 
for topsecret business officials say 
but some members of congress might balk at that idea as empire 
building said rep olympia snowe rmaine a congressional 
expert on the embassy debacle 
it would look like were rewarding the state department for 
exorbitant mistakes in the past she said they have to justify 
the need for a new building she said 
officials at the state department said bakers decision on the 
multimilliondollar fiasco could come this week 
baker is nearly ready to make a decision the intelligence 
community has signed onto a plan said one department official 
speaking on condition he remain anonymous 
but he said baker has not approved the proposal which would 
then be sent to president bush before it is transmitted to congress 
bakers dilemma which he inherited from the reagan 
administration is what should be done with the buginfested 
redbrick building that has never been used by american diplomats 
listening devices and eavesdropping equipment were discovered in 
the building in 1985 13 years after the united states and the 
soviet union signed a construction agreement that allowed soviet 
builders to do the job 
over the past four years state department officials have 
floated a number of possible options for the building known in 
washington circles as the nob or new office building 
they include razing the building and replacing it with a secure 
facility ripping out only the top floors to make them bugfree or 
constructing a new annex as a place for secret talks and 
transmissions 
in april two key department officials ambassador nicholas 
salgo and ivan selin undersecretary for management told baker 
that constructing an annex would be cheaper than the estimated 500 
million that might be needed to tear down the nob and replace it 
the annex idea follows a recommendation by james schlesinger 
the former defense secretary who prepared a report on the embassy 
for the reagan administration he also suggested making the top 
three floors of the existing building secure 
a month before bush was elected former president reagan 
advocated razing the building saying the united states had no 
choice but to do so 
but congressional sources also speaking on condition of 
anonymity say the annex solution now appears high on the 
departments agenda 
rep neal smith diowa chairman of the house panel that 
appropriates money for the state department said one possibility 
being discussed is for the united states to buy the socalled 
change building the place russian workers changed clothes 
that is situated between the old us embassy building and the new 
building 
the change building would be torn down and replaced with a 
secure annex the bugged building could then be used for other 
purposes perhaps a cultural center a visa office or an office for 
visiting american business executives 
the department has not asked for additional money for the 
embassy building in the 1990 fiscal year 
if baker endorses building an annex members of congress will 
have some tough questions for the department snowe said for one 
they will want to know what the department intends to do with the 
extra space 
what do we do with the existing building what do we do with 
the building they are in now she asked 
another difficulty is the ussoviet reciprocity agreement that 
would give the soviets the right to demand additional space in 
washington she said the united states barred the soviets from 
occupying their new embassy in washington after the moscow problems 
were uncovered 
other congressional sources said there are sure to be questions 
about how to protect those who worked in the annex those dealing 
with sensitive material would be easily identifiable they said 
regardless of bakers decisions officials said it would take 
several more years before the situation is resolved

more than a week after a school bus careened 
over the unguarded lip of a 40footdeep pit killing 21 students 
visitors stop to pray and light candles at the site 
ernestina garcia brought 20 candles each in a paper sack that 
glowed at the edge of the chasm filled with about 12 feet of 
stagnant water 
we usually do this at christmas and i thought it would be a 
nice thing to do for the kids she said one evening last week 
her friend rose mary rios was back the next morning exactly a 
week after the sept 21 crash happy to see that the candles had 
burned all night 
neither woman had children on the bus but both knew victims in 
the small south texas community of alton where the tragedy is 
still too horrible for some to believe 
its going to take some time said mayor san juanita zamora 
it will take time 
activities at mission junior high and mission high school where 
the victims and 59 survivors attended were returning to normal by 
the end of the week football resumed with a junior high game 
thursday afternoon 
then friday the community was shaken again when 15yearold 
elizabeth flores died at mission hospital becoming the 21st 
fatality she had been in a coma and on lifesupport systems since 
the accident 
but friday nights football games went on keeping the students 
busy and moving ahead with life are the best remedies said head 
football coach sonny detmer of mission high school 
its a terrible thing it had to happen but at least it 
happened during football season the coach said if it had 
happened any other time of the year it would have been depression 
until football season started again 
you cant tell them to forget it because theres no way 
theyre ever going to forget it detmer said you just tell 
them to go on 
counselors in the region mobilized and will continue to help the 
students their teachers and families and others in the grieving 
community officials said 
weve had several teachers who i would say took it harder than 
the kids said john abbenante junior high principal 
he started the week with an emotional talk over the schools 
public address system while tearful teachers and counselors 
embraced shaken survivors and their friends 
more and more survivors came back to school some by bus as the 
week progressed he said but a few found it impossible to stay all 
day 
juan v granados 12 who escaped through a window in the bus 
has started going to school in his fathers car and didnt know if 
he would become a bus rider again 
maybe he said 
some of the scores of rescuers also have had trouble coping with 
the sight of so many young people dying a group counseling session 
with the charter palms hospital of mcallen helped said shawn 
snider an emergency medical technician with the alamo fire 
department who cannot remember any of the dead childrens faces 
a dramatic associated press picture transmitted around the world 
showed snider and another rescuer as one of them tried to 
resuscitate a student pulled from the murky waters snider said the 
boy did not live 
when i looked over that cliff and saw all that yellow the 
submerged bus it was like somebody hit me with a 2by4 and i 
started shaking said snider who thought he was used to seeing 
trauma victims everybodys dealing with it everybodys having a 
hard time 
red cross volunteer anna rubio said the organization would be 
around for a long time helping victims families citing a parent 
who has not worked for a week and will need gas money the 
organization is using a trailer at alton elementary for its 
operations 
daniel rodriguez father of 16yearold victim ana delia 
rodriguez said his main concern was obtaining a headstone for his 
daughters grave 
valley cocacola bottling co owner of the truck that went 
through a stop sign and knocked the bus into the pit offered to 
pay funeral and medical costs for victims and survivors 
at least one lawsuit has been filed against the company with 
others in the works according to lawyers 
the national transportation safety board is winding down its 
investigation but probably will not have a report out for nine 
months said chief investigator bob barlett the ntsb has concluded 
that the trucks brakes worked well enough to halt it at the stop 
sign in alton 
no charges however have been filed against the truck driver 
25yearold ruben perez of mission on administrative suspension 
from his duties 
no guard rail separated the pit from the roadway 20 feet away 
and no road signs warned of its presence but authorities said that 
was not unusual in south texas the pit was one of thousands dug in 
the southwest to mine caliche a sandy gravel mixture that occurs 
naturally in desert areas and is used for construction 
hidalgo county officials are talking about ways to make the pits 
safer 
residents are discussing a memorial at the site which along 
with candles has been marked by several wreaths other reminders of 
the tragedy are a childs red tennis shoe two tshirts the 
remnants of notebook paper and a blue ballpoint pen floating on the

the new head of the nations secondlargest 
republic pledged in an interview published saturday to attack acute 
housing and food shortages that built up during the 17year rule of 
his conservative predecessor 
the communist party daily pravda also printed an interview with 
president mikhail s gorbachev in which he gave lukewarm thanks to 
outgoing ukrainian leader and conservative politburo member 
vladimir v shcherbitsky indicating the differences that colored 
the mens relationship 
the tempo of renewal in various spheres of life in the 
republic is clearly insufficient new party leader vladimir 
a ivashko told pravda in his first published comments since being 
chosen thursday to replace shcherbitsky 
the people are very dissatisfied said the new chief of the 
republic that is home to 50 million people the soviet breadbasket 
and an important coalproducing and industrial area 
he ticked off a halfdozen priorities that included improved 
housing food supplies consumer goods health care the 
environment and nuclear energy problems linked to the chernobyl 
nuclear power accident in 1986 and the construction of another 
nuclear plant in the crimea 
ivashko also pledged to allow the full development of ukrainian 
culture a sign he is likely to be more inclined toward compromise 
with those who are pushing for preservation of the ukrainian 
language and demanding more economic and political autonomy 
the ivashko 56 seen as a supporter of gorbachevs reforms 
said one of his main tasks will be to work out a program of the 
ukraines economic independence within the framework of the soviet 
economy 
shcherbitsky 71 the last politburo holdover from the regime of 
president leonid i brezhnev was intolerant of dissident 
however under gorbachevs reform policy ukrainians began 
making the same demands as other ethnic activists in the soviet 
union and in early september they held the founding meeting of the 
rukh political movement the grassroots political movement 
professes support for gorbachevs reforms but that in some cases 
goes further in demanding democratic reforms and local control 
echoing gorbachev ivashko said one of his most important tasks 
would be to strengthen the party so that it does not lose 
initiative at a time when many informal political groups are 
placing demands before it and the government 
there had been many reports in the past several years that 
shcherbitsky was being forced out by gorbachev but he held on to 
his job until he and two other politburo members were eased out of 
the countrys ruling body on sept 20 ukrainian party leaders 
chose ivashko in secret balloting on sept 28 
in rather brief remarks about shcherbitsky gorbachev told 
pravda the retired leaders many years of party work deserved a 
high evaluation 
gorbachev who took part in the ukrainian party meeting at which 
shcherbitsky retired said party leaders praised the former leader 
as a person who worked very hard and was not satisfied with what 
was achieved 
gorbachev indicated that shcherbitskys age and health were 
among the reasons he was relieved 
shcherbitsky told pravda that ivashko had all the necessary 
qualities to run the ukraine and that he would justify the trust of 
party leaders

cambodian guerrillas claimed 
saturday to have scored their biggest victory in 10 years with the 
capture of three towns and 10 other government positions 
specific claims could not be confirmed by independent sources 
but western sources at the thaicambodian border confirmed that one 
guerrilla faction the khmer peoples national liberation front 
made major gains against cambodian government forces 
we will know more in the next couple of days at the moment it 
is difficult to judge how much is true and how much is 
propaganda a western relief official based in aranyaprathet said 
on condition of anonymity 
the claims came less than a week after vietnam said its last 
troops had left cambodia where they fought the guerrillas for more 
than a decade 
abdulgaffar peangmeth spokesman for the liberation front said 
5000 fighters launched attacks against five towns and other 
positions along highway 69 which runs parallel to the 
thaicambodian border in northwestern cambodia 
a second guerrilla faction loyal to resistance leader prince 
norodom sihanouk said it had joined the liberation front in a 
general offensive and had taken part in some of the fighting on 
saturday 
a sihanouk spokesman bounthy ung said the khmer rouge the 
communist faction in the threefaction coalition had not joined 
in the fighting 
the groups are fighting the cambodian government in a loose 
coalition led by sihanouk 
the western relief official said heavy shelling could be heard 
during the day near aranyaprathet a key border town 
the acting liberation front commanderinchief gen dien del 
said the insurgents damaged a number of tanks overran 10 phnom 
penh army positions flanking highway 69 and seized the district 
capital of thmar puok which the vietnamese army had left just six 
days ago as part of its withdrawal from cambodia 
bounthy ung also said the fighters had taken phom srok a 
district seat about 40 miles inside cambodia from the thai border 
dien del said the insurgents also seized banteay chmar and found a 
warehouse containing 1000 weapons and other military hardware 
the general said his forces were closing in on two other towns 
svey chiek and kandoun and had surrounded sisophon at the 
strategic crossroad of highway 69 and national route 5 which leads 
to phnom penh 
dien del said the guerrillas intended to test the strength of 
the cambodian government and force phnom penh to the negotiating 
table today is a very big day for the kpnlf it is the largest 
victory in 10 years 
he said the attackers suffered few casualties 
a western diplomat who requested anonymity questioned whether 
the guerrillas would be able to hold onto their gains 
the liberation front reportedly using conventional war tactics 
rather than guerrillastyle ones in the attacks is armed with 
lightinfantry weapons and newly acquired 84mm antitank rockets 
the sovietsupplied cambodian army has tanks and heavy artillery 
we have less war material than the government dien del 
said but we have more experience better morale and better 
training we have been fighting for 10 years 
the liberation front claims to have more than 16000 fighters 
the strongest guerrilla group the khmer rouge fields between 
30000 and 40000 according to western estimates 
vietnam which invaded cambodia and ousted the khmer rouge in 
late 1978 said it completed the withdrawal of all its troops from 
the country on tuesday but the guerrillas say thousands of 
vietnamese have stayed behind 
the khmer rouge recently claimed a series of battle successes 
against cambodian army units officials in phnom penh have admitted 
some setbacks near the town of pailin in western cambodia but 
insist their forces can keep control of the area 
when it was in power between 1975 and 1978 the khmer rouge 
killed hundreds of thousands of people in an attempt to impose a 
radical agarian society

the speaker of lebanons splintered 
parliament told the assembly saturday that they have no choice but 
to find a way to end their nations 14year cycle of bloodshed 
christian and moslem lawmakers gathered in this mountain resort 
for their first meeting in more than a year are divided over the 
presence of syrian troops backing moslem forces in lebanon and 
moslem demands for greater power 
speaker hassan husseini a shiite moslem told the deputies that 
failure to resolve their differences would mean a total loss of 
hope in the devastated country where fighting has been halted by 
a fragile truce 
we have no choice but to succeed he told the 
parliamentarians 
king fahd in an opening address read by foreign minister prince 
saud al faisal in taifs conference palace called on the feuding 
christian and moslem parliamentarians to cooperate in finding a 
settlement to the conflict in which more than 150000 people have 
been killed since 1975 
now that the situation has shifted from the arena of warriors 
to the negotiators table it is high time we moved from trading 
artillery shells and accusations to hasten the peacemaking the 
kings message said 
the saudi monarch said lebanese must rule their own nation 
most of lebanon except an 320square mile christian enclave 
north of beirut is under the control of syria which has 40000 
troops in lebanon israel occupies a security zone of lebanese 
territory along its border 
fahd is a member of a threenation committee mandated by the 
22member arab league to bring peace and reconcile lebanons 
feuding factions 
fahd king hassan ii of morocco and president chadli bendjedid 
of algeria formulated a sevenpoint peace plan that calls for 
political reforms which the lebanese parliamentarians will debate 
the taif meeting the first by lebanons parliament outside the 
country was designed to reduce sectarian pressures on the 
legislators that have been a major factor in the collapse of 
earlier initiatives 
lebanese deputies who arrived in taif late friday said the 
meeting would last from three to 10 days 
before the deputies left beirut friday lebanons moslem 
government leader moslem salim hoss said the taif meeting could 
be the last chance for peace in lebanon 
conference sources said 63 of lebanons 73 surviving legislators 
33 christians and 30 moslems were in taif in saudi arabias 
western mountains 
three shiite moslem and seven christian deputies failed to show 
up no one has refused to come but some gave medical reasons for 
not attending saud said 
twentyfive of the deputies in the 99seat parliament have been 
killed or died of natural causes since the last general election in 
1972 the fighting has prevented elections since then 
a ceasefire in lebanon took effect a week ago halting six 
months of fierce artillery battles between the syrian army which 
backs the moslems and christian forces led by gen michel aoun 
more than 900 people were killed and nearly 3000 wounded in the 
fighting that included some of the most ferocious bombardments of 
the war most of the casualties were civilians 
the ceasefire and the lifting of blockades by both sides was 
the first phase of the ambitious sevenpoint arab league peace 
plan 
it envisages political reforms that will give lebanons moslem 
majority equal power with the christians led by maronites who 
under an unwritten agreement have dominated the government 
parliament judiciary and army since independence from france in 
1943 
the plan also proposed increasing the number of seats in 
lebanons parliament to 128 divided equally among christians and 
moslems since independence the christians have had a 65 edge in 
the house 
in 1943 the christians were considered the majority but 
estimates now give moslems at least 55 percent of lebanons 4 
million people 
the peace plan also proposes a syrian pullback from moslem areas 
of beirut to the bekaa valley in east lebanon within two years 
provided political agreement can be reached complete withdrawal 
would follow a security pact between syria and lebanon 
some christian legislators pressed by aoun have said they will 
not discuss political reforms until syria agrees to a timetable for 
a complete withdrawal 
syria has its troops in lebanon under a 1976 arab league 
peacekeeping mandate aoun claims the syrians have abrogated that 
mandate by siding with the moslems 
syria considers lebanon its western neighbor vital to its 
security 
the peace plan envisages the lebanese legislators electing a new 
president to replace amin gemayel a maronite whose sixyear term 
expired sept 22 1988 
in the dying minutes of his presidency gemayel appointed aoun 
to head a caretaker military government by naming a maronite as 
premier gemayel broke the unwritten covenant under which the 
president is a maronite the premier a sunni moslem and the 
parliament speaker a shiite 
moslems rejected aouns appointment and supported the 
syrianbacked cabinet led by hoss a sunni moslem

the colorful case of the city of beverly 
hills vs zsa zsa gabor adds a footnote to the history of a 
favorite hollywood genre the reallife courtroom drama 
slapping a macho cop in a traffic incident hardly matches the 
murder rape and paternity charges against other celebrities in 
past years but the beverly hills shenanigans still commanded 
worldwide media coverage 
miss gabors conviction friday on three of four misdemeanor 
counts runs counter to the trend in hollywood trials most of which 
the stars have either won or walked away from with light sentences 
miss gabors sentencing is set for oct 17 
juries are often awed by celebrities and wind up deciding in 
their favor court observers say 
the prosecutor in the twilight zone case said he thought the 
jury was overwhelmed by the defendants celebrity and acquitted 
producer john landis and four others landis was tried for the 1982 
helicoptercrash deaths of actor vic morrow and two small children 
six bailiffs were needed to shield miss gabor as she made her 
way each day to the thirdfloor courtroom through an international 
platoon of reporters eager to gobble up the actress daily sound 
bite commentaries on the trial and life in general 
the prosecutor deputy district attorney elden fox called the 
affair a media circus 
this sells newspapers or tv time fox said there is a 
great deal of public interest in finding out how their 
celebrities cases are resolved as opposed to richard ramirez or 
somebody else who doesnt quite have the celebrity status 
a los angeles jury is debating whether ramirez the convicted 
night stalker killer should receive the death penalty jurors 
will resume their work monday 
one indication of the movieland influence in the gabor trial was 
the stage marker on the sidewalk in front of the courthouse 
the tape marking spelling zsa zsa in red letters showed the 
defendant exactly where to stand before the battery of news cameras 
each day to achieve the best angle and lighting 
hollywoods first notorious trial actually took place in san 
francisco one of the silent screens most famous comics roscoe

on april 12 1922 his career never recovered he died at 46 in 
1933 
the 1935 divorce trial of mary astor and dr franklyn thorpe 
caused a sensation because of an alleged diary which chronicled her 
affairs with top movie figures the diary was never introduced as 
evidence and the actress denied it existed miss astor went on to 
star in the maltese falcon and many other films 
swashbuckling errol flynn was charged in 1942 with statutory 
rape of two teenage girls accounts of the revels aboard flynns 
yacht were trumpeted by newspapers famed hollywood defender jerry 
giesler won an acquittal for flynn whose career flourished with 
the notoriety 
young joan barry came to hollywood in 1940 to crash the movies 
and ended up in charlie chaplins bed after chaplin abandoned his 
protegee she turned up at his house with a gun and police ran 
her out of town this led to a paternity suit as well as federal 
charges for infringing miss barrys rights 
even though tests proved he couldnt be the father chaplin was 
ordered to support the baby with gieslers help he beat the 
federal charges largely because of the scandal and his 
leftleaning politics the federal government revoked chaplins 
entry permit while he was on a trip abroad several years later and 
he exiled himself to switzerland 
when robert mitchum was arrested in 1948 for smoking marijuana 
giesler again came to the rescue mitchum received two months in 
jail and emerged to find his career was in like flynns 
producer walter wanger a motion picture academy president and 
pillar of the film community suspected his wife actress joan 
bennett was having an affair with her agent and shot the man 
warning that vigilantism was not tolerated in beverly hills the 
judge gave the producer a light sentence 
in 1958 lana turners daughter cheryl crane plunged a butcher 
knife into her mothers lover johnny stompanato during a violent 
argument between the two adults giesler was the first person the

he wore a blue suit a white shirt and a 
brilliant red tie that seemed to shout usa today 
he also wore a diamondstudded usa today ring third finger left 
hand which his first wife said was much more appropriate than 
the simple little gold wedding band i put on his finger on june 16 
1946 
but al neuharth the man who helped build gannett co into a 
giant and who designed and led the first general interest national 
newspaper to profit deserves to gloat a little 
neuharth 65 and recently retired paused somewhere between 
the oprah winfrey show and donahue to talk about his 
autobiography confessions of an sob and explain why he 
admits to some of the dumb things i did 
i spent a lifetime putting a microscope on other people i 
would have felt sleazy if id just written a book bragging about 
everything that worked he said a lot of people said why show 
all the warts and i said the bible says the truth shall set you 
free and i feel a lot freer 
the book makes no secret of neuharths hardnosed business 
tactics such as taking advantage of a competitors conversation he 
overheard 
i believe in practicing the sobs golden rule 
expect others to do unto you what you would do to them 
the modern translation cover your ass 
he still works on a typewriter an oldfashioned royal used to 
beatings a word processor could not endure he carried it with him 
from college to the miami herald and the detroit free press when 
he moved to gannett and the democrat and chronicle in rochester 
ny it broke down 
they couldnt get the damn thing repaired so we put out an 
allpoints bulletin for this model and we got five of them for the 
average cost of 11 apiece they found them in old furniture stores 
in little towns we cannibalize them for parts 
when someone suggested he ask his two children a journalist and 
a lawyer to write their impressions of him as a father he took it 
a step further and suggested his two wives write their own chapters 
of him as a husband 
they did his first wife of 26 years loretta helgeland was a 
cheerleader like neuharth in high school in south dakota she 
remembers when they had only 12 cents in the bank 
a year and a half after their divorce he married lori wilson a 
former florida state senator it lasted eight years her chapter 
begins al neuharth is a snake 
on the winfrey show scheduled to be broadcast this week ms 
winfrey asks her why did you call him a snake according to 
neuharth she replied well i didnt want to insult a chameleon 
by calling him a chameleon 
no he says he will not marry again ive had two good 
marriages 
with 100000 copies on order his book has entered a second 
printing 
outspoken to the point some consider outrageous neuharth 
recently wrote a column urging airlines to get aging women and 
flighty young men off their cabin crews and bring back shapely 
young sky girls one veteran female flight attendant called him 
a neanderthal 
hes reticent on politics though he keeps his own votes a 
secret and insisted his papers not take sides 
when usa today came out for one side in the philippine 
elections neuharth blew his stack how dumb can you be 
especially for a national newspaper i think it hurts your 
credibility 
in florida where he makes his home one can register as 
democrat republican independent or none of the above when 
george wallace ran as an independent he switched to none of the 
above 
retirement he says came easily because he planned for it 
he has switched from gin martinis to vodka he still plays 
tennis jogs looks fit relaxed he remains as chairman of the 
gannett foundation which takes a couple of days a week and is on 
a committee to raise 40 million to restore mount rushmore 
but even in retirement neuharth has fourcolor daily legacy in 
his thoughts 
i think there may be room for another national newspaper but 
it would have to be quite different from usa today i mean we were 
there first and the franchise was a little fragile for a while but 
after seven years and with the base weve got and unless our people 
screw it up were in pretty good shape

faster than relief from the government the town of cary has 
adopted a small south carolina town devastated by hurricane 
hugo

aid to come through 
four fire stations in the north carolina town of 45000 will be 
collection points for donated goods in operation help our 
neighbors a convoy of town vehicles and volunteers cars will 
make the 220mile trip to deliver the supplies and help clean up 
and repair the town 
south carolina is wiped out said jonathan b graham a cary 
construction management official a lot of people here are 
sitting at home saying what can i do the worst the area 
around cary in eastern north carolina not far from raleigh got 
from hugo is some heavy rain and wind 
stan godwin carys construction superintendent visited 
summerton on saturday to see what equipment volunteers should 
bring the convoy is tentatively scheduled for next weekend but

summertons plight came to carys attention through helen and 
bert miner a cary couple whose daughter and soninlaw live in 
summerton the miners already have made two trips to the south 
carolina town in a pickup loaded with food and other supplies 
the red cross was putting all its efforts into charleston

president carlos salinas de gortari begins 
his first official visit to washington at a time when usmexican 
relations are stronger than they have been in years 
salinas said he hopes the closer ties will translate into 
economic gains 
mexican nationalism no longer has to feed on antius 
feelings said an official close to the president 
antiamericanism is no longer a valid issue in the mexican 
political debate 
salinas and his wife cecilia were to travel to camp david on 
sunday as guests of president and barbara bush before official 
visits to washington and new york he will receive an honorary 
degree from brown university before returning to mexico on oct 6 
bush and salinas are perceived in mexico to have a personal 
friendship unmatched in the history of relationships between us 
and mexican presidents 
there is a relation of mutual respect that allows 
cordiality salinas said thursday night 
bush has a very important characteristic that appeals to 
salinas he is not an ideologue the official close to salinas 
said on condition of anonymity bush has gone out of his way to 
show special consideration for salinas 
mexicans see the invitation to camp david as a special honor it 
will be only the third time a mexican president has been there 
ten months into his term salinas has become the symbol of a new 
image for mexico a country regaining selfconfidence after nearly 
eight years of economic crisis a country eager to resume economic 
growth and assume an international role in commerce and foreign 
affairs 
the salinas and bush administrations worked closely in july to 
renegotiate a large part of mexicos 107 billion foreign debt and 
the deal was closed after us treasury secretary nicholas brady 
lobbied commercial bankers in his office 
the mexicans hope for a respite through debt and interest 
reductions that will make more money available for salinas 
development projets he also hopes for improved trade agreements 
with the united states and more foreign investment 
salinas 41 has gained respect here and abroad by his dramatic 
blows against corruption including the jailing of previously 
untouchable labor bosses and by ordering the arrests of several 
top drug traffickers 
us officials have said they are very pleased by salinas war 
on drugs even though many agree with mexican officials who say the 
real problem is us demand 
mexico has seized more than 24 tons of cocaine this year 
salinas said at a news conference thursday he said the amount was 
significant but that a lot of drugs are getting through 
in foreign affairs salinas has departed from the antiamerican 
position of previous administrations a policy that appeals to 
mexicans who still remember that the united states took over half 
of their nations territory following the mexican war in 1845 
the mexican government no longer feels inhibited from agreeing 
with the united states in some foreign policy matters said a 
salinas aide 
salinas has taken drastic steps to improve the economy 
reducing government controls selling governmentowned companies 
opening new fields to domestic and international investors and 
forcing inefficient mexican manufacturers to compete with 
lowercost foreign producers 
now he hopes that his campaign on drugs and economic reforms 
will help him gain us trade concessions 
we want trade reciprocity salinas said referring to the 
opening of mexican markets to us products from refrigerators to 
compact discs 
he expects to return from his visit with bilateral agreements on 
products such as textiles and steel although us officials have 
said theyre not sure those agreements will be ready for signature 
salinas also will meet with investors and top industrial 
managers during his trip he has invited foreign and domestic 
investors to participate in companies previously run by the 
government such as the telephone system 
salinas claimed his economic policies have encouraged the return 
of more than 25 billion held by mexicans abroad and said his 
government has approved new foreign investment projects worth 2 
billion since march 
mexicos economy is growing this year at a rate of 25 per cent 
far better than the 1 percent projected and inflation is 
expected to be no higher then 30 per cent a drop from 517 percent 
last year salinas said 
the president is much stronger politically than he was when he 
took office dec 1 according to opinion polls in the capital 
where salinas institutional revolutionary party lost by a wide 
margin 
however his election was marred by charges of widespread fraud 
and he still faces domestic pressure to approve electoral reforms 
that could break the grip his party has had on mexican politics for 
decades

hundreds of black and mixedrace 
people declared the end of apartheid on two whitesonly beaches 
saturday by picnicking swimming singing and praying under the 
watchful eye of the police 
protesters at the strand a conservative seaside town 20 miles 
east of cape town made sure they had staked their claim 
properly they walked around and wet their feet in gods water 
said anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
wearing a yellow sunhat with the slogan free the beaches 
and a tshirt saying just call me arch the 56yearold tutu 
jogged on the beach he then held a prayer service after persuading 
police not to use force on the crowd which ignored police orders 
over loudspeakers to disperse 
organizers had refused to seek permission to hold the 
demonstration 
some families left after the police removed foreign television 
crews and local photographers but most stayed opening their 
picnic lunches swimming and wading in the water as the crowd grew 
to 1500 
about 100 whites watched from the roadside many criticizing the 
protest as they talked among themselves 
police took no action many officers even began smiling and 
waving as they left when the crowds thinned in the afternoon 
i hope that the inhabitants of the strand will realize that we 
have liberated them tutu told a news conference later they 
dont have to watch whether black people are walking on their 
beaches any longer they will enjoy the liberation of being able to 
share 
another 1000 people gathered in the eastern cape province city 
of port elizabeth where former mayor graham richards erected a 
homemade sign declaring pollock beach reserved for whites for 35 
years was open to all 
the city council has tried to end beach segregation but the 
provincial administrator appointed by the governing national 
party has refused 
the wood sign resembled nearby municipal signs declaring the 
beach is for the use of whites only the new sign said we the 
people of port elizabeth hereby declare pollock beach open for the 
use of all people 
seven buses brought black people from townships 10 miles north 
of port elizabeth many black youths chanted and danced around the 
beach some carried banners and placards whites paid them little 
attention and mixed freely on the sand and in the water 
this mass nonracial picnic reminds us who we are that we 
are gods family it is human selfishness and greed that makes 
beaches for whites only the rev david vika of the 
interdenominational ministers association said at a prayer service 
after the sign was posted in the sand 
a magistrate gave permission for the port elizabeth 
demonstration which was rained out by midafternoon 
no approval was sought for the protest at the strand but police 
had been quoted in the cape town newspapers as saying they would 
take no action as long as the demonstration was peaceful 
there was no explanation for their change of mind when they 
drove vans onto the beach and ordered the crowd to leave within 
three minutes 
tutu said he was afraid that when police took the journalists 
away they planned to use force against the crowd 
on aug 19 tutu recalled when thousands of blacks tried to get 
to the strand beach police used whips and dogs to drive them away 
the rev john freeth anglican archdeacon of the athlone 
mixedrace township said saturday evening 
the police deserve credit for withdrawing there were no nasty 
incidents it was a peaceful picnic against racial discrimination 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
28 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services

federal drug enforcement officials say they 
have no evidence that drug trafficking played a part in the mystery 
flight crash and gunshot wound of thomas root last july 
but a miami spokesman for the fbi paul miller said the bureau 
is continuing to investigate the activities of the alexandria va 
communications lawyer in the days preceding his bizarre odyssey 
according to the fort lauderdale fla sunsentinel 
con dougherty spokesman for the drug enforcement 
administration said in washington on saturday that the question of 
drug involvement obviously was looked into and nothing was 
found to draw the interest of headquarters 
roots cessna crashed into the atlantic near the bahamas july 13 
when it ran out of fuel several hours after takeoff from washington 
national airport after his rescue hospital authorities discovered 
a gunshot wound in his abdomen root said he had blacked out 
shortly after takeoff but didnt suffer the gunshot wound until 
his pistol was accidentally triggered by the impact of the crash 
the dea interviewed root after his fateful flight when it 
learned that virginia authorities had earlier discovered under 
warrant several weapons and a quantity of ether which the lawyer 
kept in the manassas va hanger that housed his singleengine 
plane but all the guns were licensed no drugs were found and he 
was not charged with any crime as a consequence of that april 24 
search 
just to clear the air we wanted to talk to mr root regarding 
the receipt of that search warrant said mario perez of the 
deas washington field office his explanations were forthcoming 
we found none of the essential elements to continue an 
investigation 
perez said root told the dea that as a gun fancier he kept his 
collection at the airport so as not to tempt the small children in 
his home and neighborhood root has said publicly that he used the 
ether a medical compound sometimes used in processing cocaine to 
clean oil and residues from his plane 
roots wife kathy expressed relief that her husband had been 
cleared by the dea officials were certainly glad that what his 
friends and family knew to be true all along has been determined to 
be the case by the federal government she said 
the national transportation safety board has yet to report on 
its separate investigation into the crash though the legwork has 
been completed and the sunsentinel quoted miller as saying the 
fbis 11week investigation of roots activities before the flight 
would continue

hurricane hugo but said today that red tape held up their flight 
to the caribbean 
we heard there were no medicines and people were going into 
comas said dr william osborne medical director of southside 
health care center which is sending the team so we volunteered 
to go 
he said military officials in washington and puerto rico were 
trying to track down what happened to the military plane osborne 
thought he had arranged to carry the eight doctors two nurses a 
respiratory therapist a pharmacist and a social worker to st 
croix 
were just trying to do something thats right and were being 
held up by all this red tape he said theres a possibility we 
may not go if we cant get the plane this weekend some people have 
other commitments

was delaying the military jets arrival 
he said if the medical team cant leave this weekend he may 
spend the week gathering more supplies and go next weekend to st 
croix where hugos fury killed four people and left most of the 
islands 55000 residents homeless hungry and desperate 
osborne said friday that the group had been planning the trip 
since monday they expect to spend three days treating patients and 
assessing the islands medical needs 
if we do deem there is more need we can come back and rally 
the entire black community to assist in the efforts with the 
intention of returning at a later date osborne said that is 
our hope 
kim butler a social worker at an atlanta hospital and a native 
of st croix worked out details with civil defense officials in 
miami who put her in touch with officials in st croix 
the southside staff spent monday and tuesday bundling up several 
boxes of antibiotics antiseptics insulin syringes bandages and 
gloves and shipped the package off to st croix wednesday 
the team will take more supplies with them including tetanus 
immunizations and medication for heart and blood pressure 
conditions osborne said 
the group chose to go to st croix because members saw a greater 
need there than in south carolina which also was raked by hugos 
desructive winds 
we felt enough people were helping in charleston osborne 
said this island was totally devastated

below the tillamook county landfill an 
algaelike mush lines a stream that slowly empties into what was 
once olof hallstroms dairy pasture 
hallstrom suspects the water is the source of health problems 
that dogged his cows and eventually affected him his wife and four 
of their five children 
hallstroms quest to right was he considers an injustice has 
taken him to the us supreme court which will hear arguments 
wednesday in his lawsuit to force tillamook county to clean up the 
landfill 
for the softspoken 59yearold farmer and inventor the 
decision by the high court to hear the case is another step in a 
persistent fight that began years ago with his father 
he knows whats right and hes stubborn about it but hes 
stubborn in a very gentle way he smiles and doesnt move said 
hallstroms attorney kim buckley 
the case turns on a narrow point of law involving notice 
requirements but environmentalists who support hallstroms 
arguments say it could have a broad impact on citizens ability to 
seek enforcement of the nations environmental laws 
hallstrom and his wife mary live on a hill overlooking the 
tillamook river on the rainy oregon coast spread out below is 
whats left of the 200acre dairy farm that hallstroms father 
olof sr established in the late 1920s 
and above the pasture on the hill opposite the hallstroms home 
is the site where in 1980 the county developed a landfill on 
ground residents had used for years as a dump 
hallstrom contends dead animals transformers full of toxic oil 
herbicides lead paint and other materials were left at the dump 
which was used for open burning in the 1940s 
it wasnt until he read a 1973 issue of a dairy trade magazine 
that hallstrom suspected the landfill was causing his problems 
i had lost quite a few cows and really not knowing what the 
cause was hallstrom said 
he began testing runoff and found toxic materials on his land 
including arsenic selenium boron copper cyanide manganese 
zinc and phenols at levels exceeding state and federal standards 
doctors said exposure to such substances could be the reason he 
his wife and his grown children must take medicine every day for 
thyroid conditions and one daughter must take medicine for her 
adrenal gland 
buckley said diseasecausing bacteria salmonella cholera and 
others also have been found in water running into the hallstroms 
pasture 
hallstrom said he gave up use of the pasture for dairy cattle 
and there never was any investigation of whether milk from his herd 
was contaminated hallstrom now keeps a few beef cattle on his land 
and owns a small manufacturing business 
the county began drawing warnings from the state department of 
environmental quality about contaminated water flowing outside the 
landfill soon after it opened it was closed in january because of 
increasingly strict environmental regulations said jon oshel the 
countys public works director since 1982 
oshel says nobody knows what was dumped at the site before it 
became a county landfill but that its impossible to dispute 
hallstroms contentions 
anyone who wanted to haul anything hauled it up there oshel 
said 
hallstrom and his wife sued in 1982 under provisions of the 
federal resource conservation and recovery act one of at least 13 
laws that give citizens the right to seek environmental enforcement 
included in the laws are provisions for giving enforcement 
agencies 60 days notice of the intent to file a lawsuit 
tillamook county challenged the lawsuit on the ground that the 
hallstroms failed to fulfill the laws requirement that they notify 
the department of environmental quality and the federal 
environmental protection agency but a us district court judge in 
portland found the notice requirement was flexible and could be 
modified 
the lawsuit proceeded to trial and the hallstroms won an order 
that the landfill be cleaned up but the 9th us circuit court of 
appeals in san francisco reversed the ruling citing the failure to 
notify 
the hallstroms appealed to the supreme court which apparently 
agreed that differing interpretations of the notice requirement by 
federal appeals courts around the country ought to be resolved 
also at stake is about 95000 in legal and expert witness fees 
the hallstroms have amassed 
the sierra club defenders of wildlife inc the national 
audubon society the natural resources defense council and the 
wilderness society have filed arguments supporting the hallstroms 
the groups argue that rigid interpretation would impede citizens 
seeking enforcement of federal environmental law

faye thompson went to a federal aid 
center saturday for a loan to rebuild her auto repair shop and 
patch the roof of her house torn open by hurricane hugo what she 
got was an application and instructions to come back oct 12 to 
fill out forms 
my house wont be standing by oct 12 said mrs thompson 
42 as a steady drizzle fell i need help right now theres too 
much red tape what good is this piece of paper going to do for my 
roof 
nine days after hurricane hugo passed a political storm still 
rages over how quickly the federal government responded to a crisis 
in south carolina where damage has been estimated at 3 billion or 
more 
the anger has focused on the federal emergency management 
agency which reports directly to the president and has a budget of 
600 million a year 
a chief critic has been sen ernest f hollings dsc who has 
accused the agency of strangling aid attempts in red tape and has 
called femas hierarchy a bunch of bureaucratic jackasses who 
would do best to get the hell out of the way 
president bush who flew to south carolina on friday for a brief 
look at the damage defended the administrations response to the 
disaster saying he was satisfied the federal government has 
moved and moved expeditiously 
charleston mayor joseph p riley jr a democrat accuses the 
agency of being slow to respond 
the system is not designed to cope immediately and urgently 
with a major disaster he said they didnt bring in enough 
people enough resources 
as one example he said fema officials asked for a written 
assessment of the need for portable generators even though 
everybody knew of widespread power outages 
fema already was in the caribbean attempting to assist victims 
of hugo as the storm roared toward the mainland spreading the 
agency a bit thin 
hugo killed 33 people in the caribbean 28 deaths on the us 
mainland are blamed on the hurricane and its remnants 
in south carolina some 50000 people were displaced by the 
storm 270000 lost jobs and at least 135000 still had no 
electricity saturday 
gov carroll campbell warned that the state must build 65 miles 
of protective sand dunes to prevent further damage to the 
coastline the tide is expected to rise to 2 feet higher than usual 
in midoctober a onceinadecade high because the moon will be 
unusually close to the earth the tide could further erode beaches 
the governor said he discussed the mindboggling dune 
project with bush federal funds would cover threefourths of the 
65 million needed for the project 
campbell requested federal disaster aid the day after hugo 
struck the state sept 21 a fema representative in charleston took 
an aerial survey of the coast and bush signed the disaster 
declaration before noon the same day 
but the first fema office didnt open until thursday a week 
after hugo battered the region one of the first five fema centers 
is located in a former toy store and was opened before electrical 
power was restored five more open this weekend 
fema spokesman bill mcada said the agency waits at least four 
days before it opens aid offices to give victims time to contact 
their insurance agents 
the centers help people get grants for repairs to homes or 
businesses and aid for those who lost jobs to the storm assistance 
also can be given on tax questions insurance claims and price 
gouging 
under one program fema reimburses individuals and families who 
qualify for temporary housing for up to two years those who dont 
qualify under that program can apply for up to 10000 in grants 
those who need immediate help with food clothing and shelter 
are directed to the american red cross 
residents looking for help are disheartened to find that jobless 
pay may take two to three weeks to process and they may not 
actually receive their loans for two months 
were doing the best we can said fema manager shirley 
caraway i feel for the people but this process is necessary 
its something they have to go through its their tax dollars 
local officials gave the federal agency mixed reviews 
richard wern mayor of st george in the hardhit rural county 
northwest of charleston said he had no contact with fema and no 
nearby aid center though hundreds of people were waiting in line 
in his town for food and water 
they need money to repair their water systems and their 
wells he said that would help them become more 
selfsufficient more quickly 
but in coastal georgetown city administrator mitch sizemore 
said femas help in paying for repairs to the municipal power 
system is going to be tremendous 
sizemore said some of the disappointment in fema may be based on 
unrealistic expectations among elected officials unfamiliar with 
the agencys mission calling it a reimbursement agency that 
moves in after the initial response by local governments 
riley said the federal government should crosstrain employees 
in all departments to handle emergencies so thousands of workers 
could be shipped to disaster areas to process requests fema has 
350 people in south carolina handling claims 
gregg chappell whose department oversees femas disaster 
assistance program admitted the scope of hugos destruction 
overwhelmed the agency 
we need to deal with this type of disaster this huge 
disaster differently than we do the normal disaster he told 
cnns newsmaker saturday 
but the concession meant little to ron gibson who has been 
living out of one suitcase since his house and clothing shop on 
sullivans island was badly damaged in the storm 
i havent been able to work i sit in the dark in frustration 
and stand in these long lines gibson said there has to be a 
better setup if it means expediting things quickly and settling up 
later do it

a top colombian cocaine trafficker wanted 
in the united states has been arrested in ecuador and may be 
extradited to colombia within a few days a senior government 
official said saturday 
evaristo porras ardila regarded as a leader of the medellin 
drug cartel was detained thursday in tulcan a town on the 
colombian border and turned over to ecuadors drug police force 
the official said 
we are going to extradite him to colombia after the 
investigation is completed said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
a spokesman for the colombian embassy said the united states 
wants to extradite porras ardila and try him on unspecified drug 
trafficking charges 
but porras ardilas name is not on a list the us justice 
department compiled of the top 12 most colombian traffickers being 
sought by us courts and no information was immediately available 
on charges pending against him 
another colombian official who also demanded anonymity 
described porras ardila as one of colombias eight most 
important narcotics traffickers he is said to have his base in 
leticia in colombias amazon jungle region 
porras ardila has been linked with the assassination of 
guillermo cano director of the colombian newspaper el espectador 
sources said he has been arrested twice in colombia but was 
released by judges both times 
tulcan the ecuadorean town where porras ardila was arrested 
thursday is 90 miles northeast of quito 
earlier this month ecuador extradited to colombia two drug 
traffickers who entered the country illegally in a small plane with 
300000 in cash 
for the last two years colombian drug cartels have increased 
their presence in ecuador a small nation of 10 million people 
making it an important transshipment point for cocaine smuggled to 
the united states and europe 
president virgilio barco of colombia ordered a crackdown on the 
drug cartels in his country after sen luis carlos galan a leading 
presidential candidate and outspoken foe of drug trafficking was 
assassinated aug 18 
the traffickers responded by declaring war on the government 
and they said in a communique earlier this month that they would 
prefer a grave in colombia to a jail cell in the united states the 
top traffickers sought by the united states are believed to have 
fled colombia to evade arrest

when the national elks lodge changed its 
voting rules over the summer people such as thomas j montgomery 
were supposed to find it easier to become members 
but montgomery a retired state worker and decorated world war 
ii veteran was rejected last month by the elks lodge in the los 
angeles suburb of van nuys in a vote many people blamed on racism 
i feel like a small boy that stubbed his toe said 
montgomery 69 of pacoima it hurts too bad to laugh and im too 
old to cry 
two months after the elks lodge abandoned what many considered a 
discriminatory voting system black applicants still find it 
difficult to become members of the 121yearold benevolent and 
protective order of elks 
montgomery was one of three black applicants denied membership 
in two california lodges in september reigniting a controversy 
over the elks membership practices a lodge in salinas rejected a 
black police officers application prompting at least 20 elks to 
resign 
officials with the virtually allwhite 16 millionmember 
organization maintain that the elks are not racist and that 
applicants were turned down for other reasons 
national elks spokesman robert yothers called the rejections 
isolated incidents that have been blown out of proportion 
he wouldnt say how many blacks are in the organizations 2300 
lodges or whether other blacks in other states had been accepted 
or turned down since the rule change 
earlier this year a lodge in lompoc 140 miles northwest of los 
angeles rejected two black applicants with community anger and a 
state attorney generals investigation hanging over their heads 
lodge officials decided to join civil rights activists in 
pressuring the national lodge to change the voting rules 
under the old rules a prospective member could be rejected or 
blackballed by only three no votes regardless of how many 
members vote for approval critics said this system gave too much 
power to a racist minority 
the elks voted at their national convention in new orleans in 
july to abolish the blackball system in favor of a twothirds 
majority the lodge kept its secret ballots and its allmale status 
the lompoc lodge on a second vote sept 12 accepted the two 
black applicants who had been rejected but on the same night the 
van nuys lodge turned down montgomery and another black applicant 
jules s bagneris the lodge also rejected a white applicant jack 
sheffield 
all three sponsored by lodge member and state sen alan 
robbins were again rejected on a second vote sept 19 prompting 
angry responses from local politicians and the threat of a city 
investigation 
state rep howard l berman called on the internal revenue 
service to revoke the taxexempt status of the van nuys lodge he 
said the public should not be forced to subsidize racial 
discrimination 
los angeles mayor tom bradley urged robbins to resign from the 
lodge robbins said he is staying at the behest of the men he 
sponsored who want to reapply after the mandatory sixmonth 
waiting period 
i recognize that in the process of trying to achieve any gain 
theres going to be some pain and struggle involved said 
bagneris 29 a minister and unsuccessful city council candidate 
im willing to go walk the road now so that in five years from 
now it will be an easier road for someone else 
in salinas however many elks members decided not to stay and 
fight after the lodge on sept 13 rejected policeman brandon hill 
among those turning in their membership were the lodges exalted 
ruler scott erdbacher along with the citys mayor a municipal 
court judge a school superintendent and several of hills fellow 
officers 
they didnt want a black person in the lodge that was all 
there was to it said erdbacher a lawyer i am outraged by 
this 
while elks officials deny that racism was at work yothers said 
that the group would look into the rejections in van nuys and 
salinas 
if it is determined or can be determined that people were 
rejected because of race and if we can identify who cast the 
ballots against them action will be taken he said but 
rejecting somebody on the basis of race is clearly against 
everything the elks stand for

the pen international writers association plans 
to increase its eastwest contacts to take advantage of easing 
political tensions brought about mainly by the soviet unions 
political reforms 
we have the feeling that we have now a historical moment 
alexander blokh pens international secretary said at the 
conclusion friday of the organizations 54th world congress 
he said writers from western and eastern european nations now 
can meet across what was yesterday the iron curtain in full 
confidence in full friendship 
the next pen world congress will be held in november 1991 in 
vienna austria before that the association plans to arrange 
regular meetings in vienna so that writers from the east and west 
can exchange information they might have missed during the past 40 
years of limited contacts 
there might be new misunderstandings we have lived very 
different lives blokh said we think we should use this 
magnificent opportunity to get to understand each other in depth 
a soviet russian chapter based in moscow was admitted to pen in 
may ending a 65year division with moscow and it sent delegates 
to the canadian congress 
a second soviet chapter for ukrainian writers and based in 
kiev was accepted during last weeks congress separate czech and 
slovak chapters also were recognized 
pen the international association of poets playwrights 
editors essayists and novelists was founded in london in 1921 and 
now has some 11000 members in 95 chapters 
but while optimism was expressed about soviet president mikhail 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness there also were words 
of caution 
czechoslovak playwright vaclav havel denied a passport by his 
government to attend the congress sent a message asking pen to 
care for the frail foundations of our reawakened czech and slovak 
centers 
havel also asked the associations members to hope with us 
that the czechoslovak authorities who have so far approved will 
not change their mind about the pen chapters 
the associations writers in prison committee reported that the 
number of cases on its list has reached a fiveyear high 
it is a tendency that is very dangerous and unhappy swedish 
publisher thomas von vegesack the committee chairman said friday 
he said that in may 1987 just before the glasnost campaign 
started the continent with the most cases of jailed writers was 
europe but most new cases now are in the far east 
von vegesack said 78 releases and 127 new arrests have been 
reported since march bringing the number of cases to 358 
he also said the committees most recent information from china 
was 33 new cases of writers imprisoned since the prodemocracy 
demonstrations in june 
blokh called the absence of delegates from the three chinese pen 
chapters the great sadness of the convention 
a resolution called on the chinese government to cease the 
persecution of writers intellectuals and others to prohibit the 
use of torture and ensure that current detainees are treated 
humanely to guarantee the internationally recognied right to 
freedom of expression for all citizens and to release immediately 
and unconditionally those who have been imprisoned for exercising 
that right

washington apple growers grossed an 
estimated record 4936 million in the past year despite the scare 
over the chemical alar calling into question the 95 million 
federal bailout of the industry 
but industry leaders said the gross sales do not tell the full 
story because wholesale prices to farmers often lagged below the 
cost of production 
still news of the record sales counting the 95 of the 
bailout itself was a surprise to staff members of the washington 
congressional delegation who sought the bailout 
the previous record was 488 million in 1986 
thats the first weve heard they had a banner year said 
gretchen white a staff member for us rep sid morrison rwash 
who represents the nations largest applegrowing region in central 
washington 
us sen brock adams dwash who also pursued the bailout 
plans to study the sales figures said doug levy deputy press 
secretary 
he feels very strongly that the right thing was done levy 
said there was no question a crisis followed the alar scare 
levy pointed out that the 95 million came from existing 
federal funds kept in reserve to stabilize troubled agriculture 
industries the money comes from duties on foreign imports 
the 4936 million estimate was based primarily on marketing 
figures reported in july before the bailout payment was made said 
mary beth lang spokeswoman for the washington department of 
agriculture however it includes estimates of apples sales for the 
final portion of the crop year ending in september including those 
apples sold through the buyout 
washington producers received about 91 million of the buyout 
with the rest going to growers in michigan new york and elsewhere 
in the country ms lang said 
she noted the departments january forecast had estimated a crop 
worth 588 million and said the alar scare contributed to the 
lower figure six months later 
washington produced the secondlargest apple crop in its history 
last year about 65 million 42pound boxes and wholesale prices 
were below the cost of production during much of the second half of 
the year 
we have been expanding production and have expanded cost 
factors said chris schlect head of the northwest horticultural 
council an organization of washington and oregon tree fruit 
growers that lobbies congress 
he said that makes it inaccurate to look at raw sales figures 
and make yearbyyear comparisons 
the us department of agriculture in august authorized the 95 
million emergency purchase of apples stockpiled in warehouses in 
six states under the program warehouses diverted the fruit to the 
poor or to charitable organizations and were paid 
at the time warehouses were bulging with record inventories of 
fruit after summer sales slumped in the wake of the alar scare 
that controversy began in late february when a private consumer 
group said eating apples treated with the growth regulator 
increased cancer risk in children 
the apple industry and federal environmental protection agency 
and the food and drug administration disputed the report as an 
exaggeration of the risk but sales dropped the epa has proposed 
new standards for use of the chemical 
industry officials argued they would not be able to sell the 
stockpiled apples through normal channels in time to clear 
warehouses for the 1989 crop which is being harvested now 
schlect defended the program saying it stablized the industry 
and set up the prospect of a better 19891990 crop season 
in terms of gross sales apple growers made 42 percent more from 
the 1988 crop than from the weatherplagued 1987 crop which was 
still the largest in history the 1989 crop currently being 
harvested is estimated to be the largest freshmarket crop in state 
history at 75 million boxes washington will grow an estimated 60 
percent of the nations apples this year

more than 50 years ago edith spargo picked 
leatrice roys name on a pen pal list secretly hoping leatrice was 
a boys name 
even though spargo was wrong the friendship endured and the two 
kept writing they say they have no idea how many letters they 
traded neither saved the letters saying they didnt tell of 
extraordinary events 
for the first time in 45 years they talked to each other in 
person last week at roys home in a reunion that fanned memories 
and brought tears 
the correspondence began through a school program in october 
1938 in her sixthgrade class in belmont nc edith then 12 
picked leatrices name from a list in a school newspaper 
in her first letter spargo said her first question was a 
gender inquiry 
if she was disappointed that leatrice was a girl the feeling 
didnt last almost 51 years later she still writes at least once 
a month 
its just natural because weve done it so long said 
spargo 63 of asheboro nc 
roy 65 said she doesnt remember how her name got on the pen 
pal list in north carolina when the two began writing she was 14 
and a pupil at spring street junior high school 
when the spargos arrived last week it was the first time the 
women had seen each other since the july 4 weekend of 1944 at that 
time spargo then 18 and living in new jersey with her husband 
came up to new hampshire roy was 20 and not yet married 
we cried roy said her eyes filling again i couldnt 
believe it was happening i couldnt believe finally we were 
getting together

chilly chuggers jumbo burps and double gulps 
are the contenders in a soda battle that convenience stores are 
hoping consumers wont find hard to swallow 
the starvin marvin chain sells the 32ounce chilly chugger and 
at highs stores customers are offered the 46ounce jumbo burp 
seveneleven however is the leader with the mammoth 64ounce 
double gulp 
even fastfood giant mcdonalds has recognized the move toward 
gluttony and introduced its supersize 32ounce soft drinks 
convenience stores have been trying to widen their customer 
base and the easiest way to do that is to get more out of the 
customers you have said donna lawrence a spokeswoman for the 
national association of convenience stores in alexandria va 
while fountain drinks account for only 28 percent of sales at 
convenience stores they carry a 64 percent gross profit margin 
seveneleven introduced its 64ounce serveyourself double gulp 
nationwide this summer even 7eleven officials arent sure why 
anyone would want to drink a halfgallon of soda which is the 
equivalent of more than five 12ounce cans 
its an odd product said steve barnickel owner of a 
baltimore 7eleven franchise its just something we have in case 
someone wants to buy it i think its too much soda

the body of gen juan manuel de 
rosas whose 19th century rule left political anomosities that are 
still present was returned from france saturday in a move to heal 
todays divisions 
the casket wrapped in the blue and white argentine flag and 
with a red poncho and a cavalry saber on top arrived aboard an air 
force plane from paris and was flown by helicopter to rosario 188 
miles north of buenos aires 
we cannot construct a true fatherland atop hatred between 
brothers president carlos menem said in a televised speech at a 
rosario monument marking the spot the argentine flag first flew in 
1812 
rosas who exercised iron rule over a confederation of newly 
independent and rebellious provinces from 1835 until his ouster and 
exile in 1852 is considered a hero by nationalists and a tyrant by 
liberals 
in welcoming rosas we are saying goodbye to an old wornout 
anachronistic and absurd country a country of failure hatred and 
false illusions said menem who took office on july 8 
standing beside the president were some of rosas descendants 
government officials roman catholic church leaders and military 
officers 
menem said he was willing to pay all the political costs 
so that we can join hands open our hearts and put resentments 
behind us 
argentines are bitterly divided over menems announced plan to 
pardon military officers accused of human rights abuses during the 
campaign against leftists by military juntas that ruled argenina 
from 1976 to 1983 
at least 8900 people disappeared during the violent suppression 
and it is believed virtually all of them were killed 
menem denied published reports that he would use the ceremonies 
honoring rosas to declare the pardons 
thats not among my plans he told a buenos aires radio 
station i already said the pardons would be ordered before the 
end of the year perhaps before the end of the month im talking 
about october not september 
the pardons are fiercely opposed by human rights groups who 
accuse the former military rulers of genocide those groups some 
leftist political parties and a faction of menems peronist party 
launched a campaign friday to obtain a million signatures opposing 
any presidential pardon 
menem is expected to announce pardons for some or all of the 18 
generals and admirals facing trial on charges of human rights 
violations 
rosas a wealthy landowner headed the federalist party in 1828 
when the united provinces of the river plate were trying to 
organize into the country that would become argentina 
he was governor of buenos aires province from 1829 to 1831 and 
was asked by the legislature to return in 1835 he ruled with 
dictatorial powers until his removal in 1852 
defeated by gen justo jose urquiza rosas sought refuge aboard 
an english frigate and fled into exile he died in 1877 at 
southampton england where he was buried the body was exhumed 
sept 21 for transfer to paris and then buenos aires

two days of racially charged hearings on police 
brutality and a report detailing widespread segregation in the 
nations thirdlargest city show the new mayor must still heal some 
old wounds 
richard m daley was elected mayor april 4 amid fears by black 
activists that he would bring back the machine politics of his late 
father richard j daley who was mayor for more than 20 years 
before his death in 1976 
the younger daley emphasized empowerment of minorities in his 
spring campaign and after defeating black challengers in the 
primary and general election he named minorities to 11 of his 21 
cabinet positions 
but now daley finds himself on the defensive some black 
politicians say the mayor is indirectly sanctioning racism by not 
doing enough to stop it 
the racial issue resurfaced last week in two days of special 
hearings called by a city council committee to look into 
allegations of police brutality against blacks 
theres been no demonstrable change on the part of white 
leadership in this city to end racism said bob starks associate 
professor of inner city studies at northeastern illinois 
university its the same stuff and its seemingly getting 
worse 
but daley maintains that whats getting worse is irresponsible 
political rhetoric from black politicians who are looking ahead 
to the 1991 mayoral election daley is filling the remaining two 
years of the term of the late harold washington the citys first 
black mayor who was just a few months into his second term when he 
died in november 1987 
daley has denounced the alleged police brutality 
i will not ever tolerate police brutality bias or bigotry in 
the city of chicago daley said everyone should join together 
to help alleviate this problem 
also last week a human relations task force made up of business 
and civic leaders released a report saying racism in chicago was 
fueled by a shocking lack of contact between the citys ethnic 
groups 
the report based on a 15month investigation of the citys race 
relations concluded that racial divisions threaten to make 
chicago an increasingly unpleasant place to live and are 
antithetical to the citys economic growth and prosperity 
at the city council hearings thursday and friday blacks who 
alleged they were the victims of police brutality accused officers 
most of them white of unprovoked beatings false arrests 
intimidation and insulting them with racial slurs 
among them was a 55yearold grandmother callie bryant who 
testified that she and her daughter were beaten up in 1987 by seven 
white police officers who gave her the sign of the ku klux klan 
two teenage boys testified that in august they were picked up 
by white officers roughed up and then dropped off in a white 
neighborhood where they were attacked by white youths 
the poice departments record was defended by police 
superintendent leroy martin a black appointee of washington 
im the head of this police department and if this police 
department is bad its because im bad as superintendent martin 
said when this police department is attacked i must defend it 
when its wrong i must correct it

an emergency quarantine aimed at protecting 
the endangered desert tortoise goes into effect sunday closing 59 
square miles of the mojave desert to offroad enthusiasts hikers 
and grazing sheep 
were losing about 50 percent of the adult tortoises a year 
out there right now said lee delaney head of the federal bureau 
of land managements area office in ridgecrest if that 
continues it would be a few short years before we dont have a 
tortoise population 
blm workers and volunteers were out saturday ringing the area 
with signs to notify the public of the oneyear quarantine delaney 
said friday 
a number of factors are preying on the tortoise which was 
designated an endangered species in august by the us fish and 
wildlife service the quarantine will help researchers determine 
how and if the problems can be alleviated delaney said 
a respiratory disease is blamed for half of the tortoise deaths 
and more than half of the remaining adult population is showing 
signs of the illness delaney said it is hoped the closure will 
prevent the disease from spreading 
the endangered species designation for the tortoise affects 
desert areas in nevada and utah as well as california 
in nevada where the tortoise is the official state reptile the 
designation is wreaking havoc on the construction boom in las vegas 
the city and several other parties have sued in federal court in 
washington dc claiming restrictions on building should be 
confined only to areas where the respiratory disease is a problem 
delaney said stress caused by noisy and intrusive allterrain 
vehicles also is believed to be taking a toll on the animals and 
vandals have been shooting them in large numbers 
the tortoises also are suffering from poor nutrition because of 
drought conditions that have reduced vegetation and made drinking 
water scarce 
predatory ravens also have been picking off newborn tortoises 
delaney said 
you just wonder if the poor old tortoise isnt on his way out 
and there isnt anything we can do about it he mused 
but he and jim st amant senior cochairman of the nonprofit 
desert tortoise council say the preservation effort is worthwhile 
once theyre gone we dont get a second chance said st 
amant also a biologist with the state department of fish and game 
he noted that the tortoises welfare is considered an indication 
of the quality of the desert habitat and losses of the reptile 
could indicate other species are at risk 
the tortoise population has dropped sharply since the 1970s 
when the density was estimated at about 250 breeding tortoises per 
square mile 
in some areas were down to about 70 per square mile 
delaney said 
the quarantine area is north of mojave a desert city 70 miles 
north of los angeles bordered on the northwest by koehn lake the 
area includes a 28squaremile desert tortoise preserve 
people caught in the area will be cited for trespassing 
officials have said and fines will vary depending on several 
factors 
sheep will be barred from the area in an effort to help increase 
vegetation and preserve the topsoil 
pilot projects also will be tried during the quarantine 
including one irrigation effort possibly involving pipelines run 
from wells on private land 
delaney said he was surprised by the support the tortoise 
preservation effort has garnered even from offroad vehicle groups 
affected by the closure members of one group have volunteered to 
help post quarantine signs he said

with three days left before the oct 1 start 
of the new federal budget year senate chaplain richard halverson 
began the chambers deliberations thursday with a timely prayer 
benevolent lord grant to thy servants laboring under the 
urgent necessity of the fiscal deadline relief from tension he 
intoned 
few others detect a sense of urgency among lawmakers working on 
spending and deficitcutting legislation failing once again to 
complete their budget work by the start of the new fiscal year 
members of congress have demonstrated that they care little about 
meeting fiscal deadlines 
that attitude is widely expected to be demonstrated again oct 
16 that day the grammrudman deficitreduction law will 
automatically trigger spending cuts in many federal programs unless 
6 billion in savings are enacted into law an action that few 
people believe congress will take 
those automatic cuts split evenly between defense and domestic 
programs were written into law with the belief that the slashes 
would be so draconian that their mere threat would drive lawmakers 
to settle their differences and finish their work 
this year fear of those cuts is hard to find 
the talk around here is incredibly unfocused and unconcerned 
about the cuts complains sen pete domenici rnm ranking 
republican on the senate budget committee 
many legislators believe that even if the cuts take effect they 
will eventually be rolled back as they have in the past and 
noticed by few if any voters 
there will be some bad publicity and some ill effect but 
ultimately it will be nullified and well move on says rep tim 
penny dminn a fiscal conservative who believes the process must 
be made stricter 
technically the cuts temporarily take effect oct 1 defense 
department programs will have 43 percent of their budgets 
withheld while domestic agencies will be pared by 53 percent the 
difference arising because many domestic programs like social 
security are exempted 
if legislation is not enacted by oct 16 trimming the deficit to 
110 billion those temporary cuts become permanent 
but the permanent reductions do little to frighten lawmakers for 
several reasons 
the cuts can be rolled back by congress at any time as happened 
in 1987 when they lasted two months 
they would be barely noticed if they lasted only several weeks 
because agencies can juggle their budgets by delaying purchases or 
hiring and many lawmakers prefer them to the alternatives the 
capital gains tax reduction bush champions higher taxes that some 
democrats have suggested or deep cuts in specific programs 
people have said lets have it and see how bad it is 
said rep william frenzel rminn ranking republican on the house 
budget committee 
lawmakers clearly have higher priorities than obeying budget law 
deadlines or avoiding spending cuts among them are enacting new 
programs and protecting favored existing ones from spending cuts 
for example the tax bill the house will continue debating this 
week designed to save 166 billion would earn new revenues and 
cut spending on some government programs 
but it is also loaded down with provisions extending federal 
child care services restricting dialaporn companies and other 
pet causes sought by lawmakers many of these are so controversial 
that they can slow or perhaps even kill the entire bill 
chief of these is the bush capital gains plan which democrats 
fought bitterly and unsuccessfully in the house last week and 
will continue to oppose in the senate the fight has left deep 
wounds 
that poisons the well for the relations you need if youre 
going to tackle this seriously said house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif 
so far congress has sent bush just one of the 13 annual 
spending bills for fiscal 1990 
lawmakers are expected to spend the next few weeks on the 
remaining 12 measures and even longer on the tax bill 
their fearlessness about triggering spending cuts and their 
stubbornness to defend programs dear to them will do little to 
spur rapid work it also leaves many people convinced that 
budgetprocess reform would do little good 
i can think of nothing i could do that would keep politicians 
from doing what they think is politically imperative at any given 
point in time says carol cox president of the committee for a 
responsible federal budget a bipartisan watchdog group

a us air force transport plane on saturday made 
a candy drop to sweeten a history lesson for about 100 german 
children during a reenactment of the berlin airlift 40 years ago 
the airlift provided about 2 million tons of food coal and 
other goods to berliners after the soviets in east germany cut off 
overland access to west berlin 
the airlift began on june 26 1948 and ended sept 30 1949 by 
the time the blockade was lifted more than 277000 planeloads of 
supplies had been delivered to berlin 
on saturday sacks attached to parachutes floated onto the 
tarmac at west berlins templehof airport as a us air force c130 
made a candy drop to mark the 40th anniversary of the last day of 
the airlift 
candy bars and other treats were given to about 100 german 
children present for the reenactment said christina goodwin a 
spokeswoman for the us air base at templehof 
candy and raisins also were dropped by allied pilots during the 
airlift helping boost the morale of berlins children 
about 250 airlift veterans from the united states attended 
saturdays ceremonies according to ms goodwin 
they were really excited about being back here its a 
terrific trip down memory lane for them she said 
the americans included former pilots crewmembers ground crews 
radar control officials and others who had taken part in the 
airlift she said 
west berlin mayor walter momper in his address said the cold 
war must be forever past and that berlin should become a region 
of peace and good neighborliness 
the soviets blocked berlins western sectors in 1948 during 
disputes with the other occupying powers the americans french 
and british over western plans for close economic ties with west 
germany

when a farmers corn and soybean fields are 
separated by 500 feet of rushing water and the nearest bridge means 
a 45mile drive theres only one way to go the darwin ferry 
the ferry is believed to be the last one operating on the wabash 
river it soon will be carrying combines and grain trucks across 
the river between eastcentral illinois and indiana for the harvest 
with the ferry its not that big a deal said danny gard as 
he piloted the ferry toward a muddy dock while taking his pickup 
truck to indiana to inspect fields you dont really think about 
farming on both sides of the river 
gard drove off the ferry and through his fields as a pair of 
cranes stood in a small pond surrounded by sorghum and dry soybean 
leaves swirled into the air in the breeze he eased his truck back 
onto the ferry and headed for home 
this is the hard part guiding it into the dock said gard 
it never fails there are 90 people there watching you if you 
miss 
it is difficult to hire a ferryman for the seasonal work so 
often the farmers have to operate the boat themselves 
the ferry a flat yellow boat with a ramp on each end usually 
carries one piece of farm machinery at a time during busy seasons 
farmers are lied up at the dock for the fiveminute trip 
wires connect the ferry to overhead cables that span the river 
from state to state the cable system keeps the ferry from straying 
off course in strong currents and brisk winds 
power is provided by a gasoline engine rescued from a tractor 
more than 35 years ago it is mounted on a small boat permanently 
hooked to the side of the ferry the little boat rotates 180 
degrees so it can push the ferry forward or backward 
i dont know how many times its been in the river said 
gard firing up the gasoline engine whenever the old ferry sank 
the push boat sank right along with it 
there were plenty of mishaps with an old wooden ferry that 
served until 1986 
former captain clarence lathrop recalled a time when the cables 
snapped and the ferry was carried downriver 
somebody had to come and bring us back up said lathrop 
itd take a couple of motor boats 
a runaway grain truck once raced down the hill over the dock 
across the returning ferry and into the water 
a tractor and load of soybeans once was lost from the ferry and 
the unoccupied boat sank one winter and had to be repaired in the 
spring 
finally in 1986 gard said it sank big time the boat tipped 
the grain truck slipped off and the boat righted herself but she 
sank before she got back the grain was all gone but they pulled 
out the truck and it didnt have a scratch on it 
the old ferrys remains were laid to rest in a weed patch above 
the river the nine farmers who own and operate the ferry service 
had the new yellow steel boat built by a local contractor for about 
30000 in 1987 
we painted it said gard we even christened it with a 
bottle of champagne 
it would hardly seem like darwin without a ferry the first one 
was put into the wabash in 1818 riverboats used to stop at the 
town which was once a bustling hub of commerce but now is home 
only to a handful of people 
lathrop said at one time there were 50 ferries operating across 
the wabash but all except the darwin ferry disappeared 
only the need to farm on both sides of the river saved it 
some people might not like to take big equipment on the ferry 
but i just dont worry about it said gard

archbishop robert runcie the head of the anglican 
church who is discussing unification with the roman catholic 
church called saturday for all christians to accept the pope as a 
common leader presiding in love 
runcie made his appeal at an evening prayer service midway 
through his first official visit to the vatican there was no sign 
at the service of the antipapal militant the rev ian paisley of 
northern ireland who threatened earlier in the day to disrupt 
runcies fourday trip 
pope john paul ii who attended the service encouraged efforts 
to unify the two churches but said anglican ordination of women had 
seriously aggravated the differences between us 
anglican leaders have said they expect to achieve unity with 
catholics in the 21st century but the churches are still divided 
over issues ranging from the meaning of the eucharist to birth 
control 
addressing a crowd at the 17thcentury church of st gregory 
runcie said there was an urgent need to strengthen and spread 
christianity 
for the universal church i renew the plea he said could 
not all christians come to reconsider the kind of primacy the 
bishop of rome pope exercised within the early church a 
presiding in love for the sake of the unity of the churches in 
the diversity of their mission 
runcie who as archbishop of canterbury is spiritual head of the 
state church of england and leader of the worlds 70 million 
anglicans did not detail the role he envisioned for the pope 
however anglican leaders do not appear to want the pontiff to 
exercise as much authority over their church as he does over his 
own 850 million roman catholic followers 
anglicans who broke with the vatican in the 16th century over 
the popes refusal to give king henry viii an annulment are 
divided over whether to accept the pope even as a symbolic leader 
in his address at the prayer service the pope encouraged a 
commission created in 1982 to study creating a theological 
framework for unity 
but as we meet today we cannot but acknowledge that events in 
recent years have seriously aggravated the differences between us 
making the work of the commission more difficult said the 
pontiff 
john paul was referring to a decision by some of the anglican 
churchs selfgoverning groups to allow ordination of women as 
priests a practice not permitted in the catholic church one such 
church the us episcopalians ordained the first anglican woman 
bishop this year in boston 
earlier in the day runcie held his second set of talks with 
john paul runcies secretary for ecumenical affairs the rev 
canon christopher hill characterized the talks as extremely 
warm very frank 
also saturday paisley who heads the anticatholic free 
presbyterian church in northern ireland delivered a written 
protest about runcies trip to runcies press secretary eve 
keatley 
the letter accused runcie of high treason for recent remarks 
on the popes leadership 
paisley told journalists he hoped to spoil the party but 
refused to say what he would do

israeli politicians on saturday took an 
optimistic view of prospects for peace with palestinians as jews 
attended prayer services and festive meals for rosh hashana the 
jewish new year 
but violence continued in the israelioccupied territories 
where two palestinians were reported killed and 12 wounded 
troops in the occupied west bank shot to death a knifewielding 
masked man at a roadblock in the village of meithalun military 
sources said arab reports said the victim was with a group of men 
trying to block villagers from leaving for jobs in israel leaders 
of the palestinian uprising had declared a general strike on 
saturday 
in the west bank city of nablus soldiers shot to death 
20yearold silham mabruke and wounded six others during clashes in 
the area according to arab reports other arab reports from the 
gaza strip said soldiers shot and wounded six palestinians in 
scattered fighting 
the deaths brought to 577 the number of palestinians killed by 
troops or jewish settlers in the 21monthold uprising against 
israeli rule of the occupied lands forty israelis have also been 
killed and 122 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs as 
suspected collaborators 
israelis observing the jewish new year 5750 donned holiday garb 
and set out on foot for synagogues across the nation security was 
heavy 
rosh hashana is one of judaisms holiest days and many 
nonobservant jews also attend prayer services on the holiday 
which began friday at sundown and ends sunday at sundown 
the peace initiative is alive fermenting it is talked about 
and argued about prime minister yitzhak shamir said in an 
interview on armed forces radio 
egyptian president hosni mubarak telephoned shamir from new york 
during a meeting in new york with foreign minister moshe arens on 
friday and mubarak and shamir agreed to continue their dialogue 
israel radio reported saturday israel radio initially reported 
mubarak and shamir had agreed to meet but said later that was an 
incorrect translation from hebrew to english and the two leaders 
had only agreed to continue their dialogue 
mubarak wished shamir a happy new year in the rare conversation 
and said he did not want to see the unity goverment of israel 
divided over a proposal the egyptian leader put forth to promote 
talks between the jewish state and palestinians according to the 
radio report 
but shamir rejected mubaraks suggestion that israel trade 
territory for peace and negotiate with the palestine liberation 
organization which israel considers a terrorist group 
our peace initiative is based on the idea that the plo will 
not be a determining party they will not be a factor in the area 
they will be a bothersome party yes shamir said 
palestinians participating in the uprising in the occupied lands 
are demanding an independent state 
to whom should we return these territories to the 
palestinians then you are favoring a palestinian state shamir 
said 
israels peace initiative calls for palestinian elections 
followed by interim selfrule and negotiations over the permanent 
status of the west bank and gaza strip home to 17 million arabs 
shamir said his likud bloc and the rival labor party of defense 
minister yitzhak rabin and finance minister shimon peres oppose a 
palestinian state 
labor does however favor some territorial compromise 
a split developed recently between likud and labor partners in 
the coalition government over mubaraks invitation to hold talks 
in cairo with a palestinian delegation including several arabs 
expelled from the occupied lands peres accepted the participation 
of the deportees but likud rejected it 
the time has never been riper to start negotiations unless we 
want to live always by the sword peres told armed forces radio 
saturday he said israel would not accept a plo delegation as 
partners for negotiations but that there was no harm in the plo 
approving the representatives

a federal judge has approved the department of 
energys 78 million settlement offer in a classaction lawsuit 
filed on behalf of 14000 people who live near the governments 
fernald uranium plant 
us district judge s arthur spiegel ruled friday that the 
offer made by the energy department which owns the feed materials 
processing center was fair and reasonable 
the offer which was made june 30 settles a 300 million claim 
by neighbors who said the plant lowered their property values and 
inflicted emotional suffering the settlement includes money for 
longterm medical monitoring of potential health risks to nearby 
residents it also calls for the government to deposit the money in 
a courtsupervised fund by oct 15 
it was like everything fell into place and it was really 
good said lisa crawford of the fernald residents for 
environmental safety and health or fresh 
from the beginning we thought it was a good and fair 
settlement we never had any problem with it mrs crawford said 
mrs crawford and her husband filed the lawsuit in january 1985 
in september 1986 the lawsuit was certified as a classaction 
claim representing the residents and businesses within five miles 
of the plant 
spiegel rejected the energy departments contention that the 
settlement relieves the government from other claims that the 
plants neighbors might make for reimbursement of property cleanup 
costs he said the neighbors are still free to file separate legal 
claims 
the 38yearold plant located 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
processes uranium for use in nuclear reactors and weapons 
stanley chesley the lead lawyer for the residents has said 
lawyers expect the monitoring will last 30 to 40 years and track 
such things as lung cancer and kidney diseases usually associated 
with uranium pollution the monitoring must still be approved by a 
courtappointed master

was 92 
thomson died in his sleep about 5 am in the room at 
manhattans chelsea hotel where he had lived almost 50 years said 
his secretary jay sullivan 
thomson had a long career as a composer of operas ballets 
orchestral and choral works as well as film scores and incidental 
music for plays by authors from shakespeare to truman capote 
he won the pulitzer prize for music for his score to the 
documentary film louisiana story in 1949 the only time the 
pulitzer has been awarded for a movie score 
we all loved his music and rarely performed it said 
composer and conductor leonard bernstein most of us preferred 
his unpredictable provocative prose 
but he will always remain brightly alive in the history of 
music if only for the extraordinary influence his witty and 
simplistic music had on his colleagues bernstein said in a 
statement 
joseph w polisi president of the juilliard school said 
thomson helped give 20th century opera a very clearly american 
accent 
in 1988 thomson was one of 12 recipients of the national medal 
of arts an award created by congress four years earlier at the 
suggestion of president reagan 
he worked with several different styles deriving inspiration 
from such sources as baptist hymns and 19th century popular music 
born in kansas city mo thomson learned to play piano at age 
5 he worked as a church organist as a teenager 
in 1922 he graduated from harvard university and moved to 
paris where he studied with famed music teacher nadia boulanger 
and met the iconoclastic composer erik satie who was a great 
influence on him 
while in paris he met gertrude stein and wrote one of his most 
famous works the opera four saints in three acts with her as 
librettist in 1928 it premiered in hartford conn in 1934 and 
had a short but successful run on broadway that same year 
they also collaborated on the mother of us all an opera 
about susan b anthony which received its first performance in new 
york in 1947 
he settled in new york in 1940 and joined the staff of the new 
york herald tribune where he was music critic until 1954 
his newspaper pieces described as stylish bright and 
deliberately provocative were collected into four anthologies 
in 1982 he won a national book critics circle award for a 
virgil thomson reader 
thomsons latest book music with words is to be officially 
released oct 18 by yale university press sullivan described it as 
a howto book for composers people who are interested in setting 
words to music or music to words 
he always said it was something i should have written 50 years 
ago sullivan said he was very happy he got to see it before 
he died 
in an interview with the associated press before his 90th 
birthday the cherubic whitehaired thomson said ive got 
nothing wrong with me except im deaf and overweight you dont die 
from those 
thomson said the hearing problem kept him from enjoying musical 
performances more than 10 years ago but he continued to compose 
and kept busy on the lecture circuit 
he recalled that his first tribune music review said violinist 
jascha heifetz played silk underwear music but joked that when 
some other critic is unkind about his own music im convinced 
the writer is an ignorant pipsqueak and probably in the pay of my 
enemies 
thomson who never married is survived by a niece betty 
stouffer of longwood fla he will be buried in a family plot in 
slater mo sullivan said 
a memorial service is planned at the cathedral of st john the 
divine in manhattan on nov 25 what would have been thomsons

federal agents made three more arrests in the 
worlds largest cocaine seizure bringing to six the number held in 
connection with the 20 tons found in a suburban warehouse an 
official said saturday 
workers and business owners in the warehouse complex on an 
upscale treelined street said they were suspicious about the 
establishment called adrianas pottery warehouse adrianas 
prosperouslooking operators claimed to be in the velvet painting 
business 
but when authorities acting on a tip broke into the warehouse by 
knocking apart a 6 padlock they found 20 tons of cocaine the 
largest seizure in the world by a law enforcement agency 
its estimated value was between 2 billion and 20 billion 
depending on its final form for sale on the street 
three southern california men were arrested friday morning in 
connection with the case the other three all from los angeles 
were arrested later friday in their rooms at the flamingo hilton in 
las vegas 
a us drug enforcement agency source who requested anonymity 
identified the men arrested in las vegas as carlos tapia ponce 68 
his son hector eduardo tapia ponce 34 and hector tapia 66 the 
brother of carlos 
the source said carlos tapia ponce is a former mexican customs 
inspector who had worked in ciudad juarez mexico for 15 years 
the three were arrested for investigation of violation of 
federal narcotics laws and were booked into the clark county 
detention center arraignment was set for monday in us district 
court in las vegas 
the thursday night raid 25 miles northwest of downtown near the 
san gabriel mountain foothills also yielded extensive records and 
at least 10 million in cash bundled and stuffed in dozens of 
boxes 
it didnt seem like a good business said david barron the 
owner of a construction company that worked out of a warehouse next 
door they said they were dealing in paintings velvet 
paintings i didnt see a market for that in california 
nonetheless there were frequent truck deliveries to adrianas 
workers in the complex said they came as often as once a week in 
the last six months 
employees from adrianas would go from office to office asking 
people to move their cars to make way for the truck 
barron said he noticed adrianas operators seemed to be making 
an awful lot of money they were too welldressed to operate a 
warehouse business 
adrianas workers recently spread the word that the deliveries 
might start coming twice a week barron said some business 
operators discussed legal action or complaining to the police 
the 20ton cache was apparently bound for markets across the 
united states but authorities said it already had traveled about 
3500 miles along a route known among law enforcement officials as 
the trampoline 
the cocaine is moved from colombia to mexico and bounced up 
into the united states said mike holm a dea assistant special 
agent in los angeles 
the seizure easily topped the previous us record of about 
8700 pounds recorded in fort lauderdale fla in 1987 and 
surpassed the world record a 12ton seizure in colombia

the historic international 
agreement to allow thousands of east germans in czechoslovakia and 
poland to go west underscores the deep political changes at work in 
the soviet bloc 
in just one eventful night hardline czechoslovakia and 
reformminded poland have taken their places on the widening route 
of east german refugees heading to west germany 
goaded into changes and reforms by soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev the warsaw pact nations are taking a new approach to old 
problems 
in years past east german refugees in warsaw and prague would 
have had little hope of a successful exit an escape from east 
germany often involved a desperate swim a daring leap a frenzied 
dash or a heartstopping flight in a homemade glider across the 
border 
the scene was completely different this weekend west german 
television showed czechoslovak police standing by idly saturday 
afternoon as refugees carried their few belongings in sacks to the 
west german embassy to prepare for the westward journey 
hungary whose communist leadership has called for multiparty 
elections first opened the floodgates on sept 11 by removing 
border fences with austria that action launched an exodus that 
sent nearly 24000 east german refugees to west germany and left 
the hardline communist leadership in east germany furious 
emboldened by hungarys action east german refugees gathered at 
west german embassies in warsaw and prague where their numbers 
swelled to about 4100 they dug in their heels waiting for 
permission to emigrate 
the unusual agreement saturday came after weeks of diplomatic 
maneuvering including a round of talks that just ended in new york 
during the un general assembly session according to west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher he called it the most 
moving hour of my political work 
genscher stressed the roles of the west german and east german 
governments tactfully leaving out mention of czechoslovakia and 
poland 
the issue was sensitive in both countries czechoslovakia had 
pledged earlier to prevent the east germans from going to the west 
despite its reforms and the advent of a government led by a 
noncommunist poland had balked at agreeing to the refugees 
demands for fear of angering east germany a warsaw pact ally 
on saturday east germany said it had agreed to the transfer for 
humanitarian reasons and had consulted with both czechoslovakia 
and poland 
the official east german news agency adn wrote of 600 east 
germans in bonns embassy in warsaw being expelled adn also 
pointed out that east german trains would take the refugees across 
east german territory before they would go on to west germany 
the route a facesaving measure permitted east germany to say 
that it had allowed the emigrees to go to west germany from its 
territory not from czechoslovakia and poland 
still unknown is what will happen to other east germans who try 
in the future to escape to the west by way of warsaw and prague 
east germany said it expects west germany to resume normal 
international customs at its embassies after the transfer 
another unanswered question is the amount of pressure west 
germany placed on east germany to let the refugees go 
the west germans appeared to be playing hardball in new york 
last week when genscher skipped the usual niceties at a 
facetoface encounter with his east german counterpart oskar 
fischer

an appellate court has ordered the release 
of a 14yearold girl who was being held for contempt of court 
after she refused to testify against her father in a sex abuse case 
a threejudge panel of the appellate division of superior court 
ordered the girls release friday after her lawyers argued that the 
trial judge should have conducted a hearing on whether she was able 
to testify when she refused 
the panel set aside the order of superior court judge david g 
lucas who sentenced the girl to serve 60 days at the somerset 
county youth shelter said george n rover a lawyer for the girl 
lucas imposed the sentence thursday after the girl refused four 
times in court to testify against her father at his trial on 
charges of sexually abusing her 
you have acted intentionally and you have acted with purpose 
to defeat the functions of this court lucas told the girl after 
she refused a fourth time to be sworn in as a witness 
the girl has repeatedly recanted the allegations 
the appellate court also ordered a hearing to determine if the 
girl is competent to testify rover said he said the girl would 
live with her grandparents in somerset county 
the father is charged with two counts of aggravated sexual 
assault and one count each of sexual assault and endangering the 
welfare of a child he is free on 25000 bond 
timothy van hise the assistant prosecutor trying the case told 
jurors during opening arguments thursday that authorities learned 
about the case in december 1987 after the girl told friends about 
the alleged abuse van hise said the father was arrested that day 
and confessed to police 
her desire to stay with her father is not as important as his 
egregious criminal conduct van hise said you dont press or 
not press criminal charges because of the will of family members 
i have no quarrel with what judge lucas did i think he was 
compelled to take the action he took van hise said

more than 1000 former members of a 
notorious antiguerrilla police unit were demobilized saturday at 
their closed base in northern namibia the southwest african 
broadcasting corp reported 
journalists were not permitted into the base at oshakati where 
an estimated 1150 black and white officers of koevoet which 
means crowbar in the afrikaans language marched and were counted 
by members of a un mission the un force is monitoring the 
process leading to independence elections for southwest africa 
now a territory administered by south africa the territory also is 
known as namibia 
the south african press association said the former koevoet 
troopers had turned in their uniforms and weapons earlier 
they had been confined to the oshakati base since last month 
receiving retraining in ordinary police duties but they were 
allowed to go to their homes at night 
since april when the united nations began monitoring the 
transition to independence un observers have been calling for 
removal of members of the koevoet unit from the police force 
many koevoet troopers were accused of atrocities during the 
23year bush war between south africa and the southwest african 
peoples organization swapo supporters in northern namibia claimed 
koevoet members continued to harass and intimidate civilians after 
a ceasefire went into effect in april 
the united nations which is responsible for assuring that the 
nov 711 elections are free and fair adopted a resolution on aug 
29 calling for the complete demobilization of koevoet 
louis pienaar south african administrator of the territory 
disbanded koevoet as a formal unit and confined them to base he 
suggested they be allowed to remain in the police force until they 
were retrained but his spokesman gerhard roux said the united 
nations rejected the proposal 
roux said friday that pienaar was concerned that if the former 
koevoet troopers were responsibile for illegal behavior as 
policemen now they will be spread out around the country with no 
one to control them 
martti ahtisaari the un special representative for namibia 
said in july that 80 percent of the koevoet members could not write 
out a police report and were therefore unfit for normal police 
duties their skills must lie elsewhere he said 
in another development swapo president sam nujoma called on the 
united nations saturday to take further steps to stop the 
emerging culture of violence in the territory he spoke at the 
funeral of anton lubowski the organizations only white executive 
member who was assassinated three weeks ago 
nujoma who returned to namibia recently after some 30 years in 
exile said the failure of police to formally charge anyone with 
lubowskis murder smacks of a coverup police say they have 
arrested an irishman named donald acheson for questioning but no 
charges have been filed 
lubowskis body was cremated at a private service a week ago 
about 500 people attended the funeral service saturday at the 
katatura lutheran church in a black township near windhoek the

the remains of montenegros last king 
were returned to his homeland saturday for a ceremonial reburial 
representing the first time communist authorities have officially 
recognized yugoslavias royal past 
the ceremony will entail pageantry unseen in this former balkan 
kingdom since the 1860 coronation of the king nikola 
petrovicnjegos royal family members scattered across europe by 
decades of turmoil received enthusiastic welcomes as they arrived 
for the reburial 
nikola ruled montenegro today the smallest of yugoslavias six 
republics until 1916 when he was forced into exile by advancing 
austrohungarian troops 
his state funeral and that of his queen milena are scheduled 
for sunday her remains were returned with those of nikola 
the event represents a milestone in the official stance toward 
the nations history until recently the king was regularly 
denounced and ridiculed

would have landed in jail remarked a bus driver luka 
garlasevic in an interview 
remaining in exile after world war i nikola died in italy in 
1921 and his mountain domain was incorporated into the 
newlyestablished south slav kingdom by his nephew serbian monarch 
aleksandar i karadjordjevic 
montenegrin and serbian media have given prominence to the 
arrival of members of the former yugoslav royal family and their 
italian relatives who will attend the reburial 
members of europes aristrocracy not seen in yugoslavia since 
the abolishment of the monarchy and the communist takeover in 1945 
were at hand to observe the arrival of the kings remains saturday 
they were brought to the southern adriatic port of bar in 
montenegro on an italian military boat 
prince vittorio emanuele di savoia of italy prince dimitri 
romanov of russia and other relatives from elsewhere in europe were 
given warm welcomes on their arrival 
hundreds of onlookers crowded around three princesses of the 
karadjordjevic dinasty which ruled yugoslavia until the communist 
took power 
however princess jelisaveta karadjordjevic told the associated 
press that crown prince aleksandar pretender to the yugoslav 
crown could not come from london because of unresolved political 
questions 
she did not elaborate but apparently was alluding to 
communistimposed restrictions on all male members of the 
karadjordjevic family 
over 20000 people gathered at the harbor of bar to welcome the 
italian warship san marco with nikolas remains several 
montenegrins in traditional caps ringed the cortege as the coffins 
of the king and queen were driven off the ship by yugoslav navy 
vehicles 
the reburial of the remains in nearby cetinje which served as 
capital of nikolas realm was organized by montenegros communist 
authorities they will be granting his last wish 
the ceremony will be conducted by priests of the local orthodox 
church which nikola headed as bishop during his reign 
under yugoslavias communist rulers the orthodox church though 
allowed to carry on its activities has not been permitted any 
voice in public affairs 
the involvement of the church in the reburial appears to reflect 
a desire of the new montenegrin communist leadership to gain broad 
popular support after ethnic and economic protests last winter 
forced the entire ruling elite to resign 
nikolas achievements still evoke pride among montenegrins in a 
series of battles against ottoman turks nikola managed to triple 
the area of his small realm and keep it independent

a mormon church apostle on saturday 
apologized for the leaderships human frailties brought on by old 
age but issued a call for obedience to church decrees 
we are sorry for our inadequacies sorry that we are not 
better than we are we see as you see the erosion of age as it 
limits and enfeebles his leaders before your very eyes said 
elder boyd k packer 65 
the 15 members of the governing first presidency and twelve 
apostles of the church of jesus christ of latterday saints average 
69 years of age and serve under a system of apostolic succession 
until death 
packer and other members of the quorum of the mormon church 
convened the faiths 159th semiannual general conference with calls 
for obedience to revelation 
there are those within the church who are disturbed when 
changes they propose are not made or when changes are made with 
which they disagree packer said they point to these changes 
as evidence that the leaders are not inspired 
such critics are always irritated by the word obedience and 
always they question revelation it always has been so packer 
said 
the remarks seemed aimed to counter criticism from george p 
lee a member of the first quorum of the seventy and a navajo who 
was excommunicated a month ago in a dispute over for the doctrinal 
role of indians in the faith 
members of the churchs hierarchy also condemned drug use as a 
form of murder reaffirmed that women cannot hold the priesthood 
and said the safety of thousands of young missionaries amid 
political turmoil abroad is a paramount concern 
the mormons president ezra taft benson attended the gathering 
in the tabernacle on temple square but one of his counselors 
thomas s monson read the 90yearold churchs leaders address 
benson praised the faiths elderly and counseled their families to 
honor them 
elder james e faust of the twelve said that while he and his 
brethren make no claim to infallibility or perfection their 
responsibility is to receive revelation for the entire 67 
millionmember church

dissident parishoners of a 
predominantly polish roman catholic church say they have ended 
their 41week demonstration calling for the resignation of their 
pastor 
were frustrated and its time to stop said brian syc a 
spokesman for the group 
the protesters were calling for removal of the rev john bambol 
pastor at st michael the archangel church the group says it will 
continue to withhold financial support from the parish and attend 
other churches until its demands are met 
this is not a happy occasion vincent knapczyk another 
spokesman said friday we accomplished something we showed that 
people could unite if they think something is important for 10 
months demonstrators had gathered on the street outside the church 
to sing and protest 
when told about the end of the protest bambol said he didnt 
care what the group decided to do calling its demands senseless 
i didnt pay attention to those people they disturbed and 
harassed people in the church it will be a relief for the people 
in church bambol said 
the schism that divided the parish began in the summer of 1988 
and exploded in december when bambol called for the opening of the 
church to nonpoles his recommendation sparked an angry reaction 
from some parishoners who said the proposal threatened the polish 
character of the parish 
shortly after the protests began the rev roman palaszewski 
who was popular with many recent polish immigrants was ordered to 
leave the parish by the franciscan order some parishioners blamed 
bambol for the priests transfer and occupied the church for a week 
the sitin ended feb 18 when church authorities summoned 
police to evict the demonstrators the church then closed for three 
sundays 
palaszewski eventually was suspended by his superiors for not 
returning to poland as he was ordered to do the priest went into 
hiding and became the rallying point for the protesters 
since then palaszewski has traveled to the vatican to plead to 
stay in the united states he remains in poland awaiting a decision 
on his request syc said

with cheers and tears more than 800 east 
german refugees in warsaw heard a west german diplomat announce 
saturday night they could take a train to the west and go 
tomorrow to the octoberfest in munich 
the announcement followed a highly unusual eastwest accord that 
also allows about 3500 east germans in czechoslovakia to go to 
west germany the latest east german refugees will be following 
23000 countrymen who emigrated this month through hungary after 
earlier diplomatic talks 
the east germans in warsaw assembled late saturday at the west 
german embassy to prepare for their trip the embassy had been 
closed for more than a week to prevent additional east germans from 
taking refuge there 
applause interrupted the west german diplomat at virtually every 
sentence as he told the east germans they would leave warsaws 
eastern station by train at about 250 am sunday 950 pm edt 
saturday en route to their new lives in west germany 
and at 250 am the train pulled out with 809 refugees aboard 
for the journey to the west german border city of helmstedt the 
trip was expected to take about 10 hours 
the train would stop only once in east germany where the 
refugees would receive their emigration papers the diplomat said 
they were escorted by west german state secretary jurgen sudhoff 
and franz bertle head of the west german mission in east germany 
the diplomat told the crowd of jubilant refugees they would 
arrive in time to attend the traditional fall festival the 
octoberfest in munich 
tears streamed down the refugees faces as they hugged each 
other and left the crowded embassy hall to pack their belongings 
i am happy i am happy one young man said speaking through 
the bars of the compound gates 
the refugees arranged their overstuffed luggage backpacks and 
teddy bears they bundled up their children against the chill wet 
evening and finished assembling the few possessions they would be 
taking with them 
along the treelined streets a dozen buses from the state 
tourism agency were parked to take the refugees to the train 
station 
earlier in the evening those refugees who had been allowed to 
live near the embassy in a residential section of warsaw were 
escorted to the compound where others had waited out the 
diplomatic talks some had been there for more than a month 
poland where prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki has headed the 
east blocs only noncommunist government since sept 12 had taken 
a cautious approach to the delicate diplomatic problem 
while the reformoriented government wanted to see the east 
germans given passage to the west poland was sensitive to 
straining relations with east germany its neighbor and warsaw pact 
ally when he took office mazowiecki pledged to respect warsaw 
pact commitments 
on thursday after negotiations with east german envoy wolfgang 
vogel about 50 refugees in poland accepted their governments 
offer to emigrate legally if they returned home 
on saturday east germany said it had agreed to let the refugees 
in poland and czechoslovakia go to the west and that poland had 
been consulted in the decision 
during their stay the refugees in poland ate food bought for 
them at hotels and markets around warsaw trucks from west germany 
brought in bunk beds and other supplies and humanitarian agencies 
made donations

a coralencrusted battery and two 
pieces of aluminum found off a south pacific atoll did not come 
from an aircraft say members of a team searching for the wreckage 
of amelia earharts plane 
divers found the items monday leading to speculation they may 
have come from earharts plane which vanished 52 years ago with 
her and navigator fred noonan aboard during an attempt to fly 
around the world 
the searchers reported friday they had concluded the pieces did 
not come from an aircraft said spokesmen tom gannon in telephone 
interviews from suva fiji 
its back to square one i guess said gannon a retired air 
force navigator from this florida panhandle city 
gannon and tom willi a retired navy pilot are at a 
communications post in fiji linked with 28 members of the 
expedition on nikumaroro island about 900 miles to the north in 
the phoenix islands group 
willi and gannon persuaded the international group for historic 
aircraft recovery to search for earharts plane after they used 
1930s navigational techniques to plot a course indicating the plane 
may have gone down on or near nikumaroro a small jungle atoll 
expedition leader rick gillespie contacted willi on friday with 
a terse message saying that the items found were no longer 
considered aircraftrelated 
gillespie said he believed the battery was discarded by natives 
who settled on the island in 1938 a year after the plane vanished 
the atoll was abandoned in the 1950s after the islanders 
britishsponsored attempt to develop a coconut palm industry failed 
the searchers concluded that a 7footlong aluminum pipe was too 
big and heavy to have come from an aircraft and it seemed unlikely 
that a solid eggshaped chunk of aluminum found was an airplanes 
brake drum as gillespie first theorized willi said 
gillespie will continue the expedition and return with the 
search vessel to fiji on oct 10 gannon said

recommend that a capital gains cut not be included when the 
committee begins work monday on a deficitreduction plan 
bentsen dtexas said friday that an incentive for saving and
