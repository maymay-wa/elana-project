the opposition says gen manuel 
antonio noriegas appointment as chief executive is just another 
effort to perpetuate his dictatorship and makes democracy an even 
more distant dream for panama 
the generals handpicked legislature declared panama in a state 
of war on friday and named noriega chief executive to combat what 
it called us aggression 
to confront this aggression the job of chief of government of 
panama is hereby created and manuel antonio noriega is designated 
to carry out these responsibilities as maximum leader for national 
liberation the resolution said 
noriega chief of the panamanian defense forces and already the 
power behind the government is wanted in the united states on 
federal drug trafficking and money laundering charges 
washington has tried to oust him from power for 2 years with 
diplomatic pressure and economic sanctions but the general has 
weathered the us pressure as well as military coups attempts in 
march 1988 and in october 
the 510member assemblys resolution says noriega can appoint 
public officials control foreign relations convene the assembly 
and make decisions on whatever other matter or unforeseen 
circumstance affects the nations interests 
the republic of panama is declared to be in a state of war 
while the us aggression lasts said the resolution passed by 
acclamation by the peoples assembly 
noriega was sworn in on the spot 
this designation is a new imposition of a dictatorship that 
exists only to perpetuate noriegas power a statement from the 
democratic alliance of the civic opposition said 
the alliance said noriegas new title is a mere symbol 
noriega it said has been exercising unlimited power since 
the day he took command of the defense forces in 1983 and the 
appointment shows the dictatorial nature of his regime 
it said noriegas appointment was a step backward in the 
search for a democratic solution that would only serve to 
produce more and more complex problems for panama 
nonetheless the opposition reaffirmed its determinaton to 
keep struggling to achieve liberty and justice for the panamanian 
people 
in washington us deputy secretary of state lawrence 
eagleburger on friday called noriegas appointment a charade and 
nonsense 
as far as we are concerned at least there is no government 
in panama anyway he said 
as head of the government noriega holds the same title as the 
late dictator gen omar torrijos his mentor 
noriega claims the us indictments are part of a plot to renege 
on the 1977 treaties signed by president jimmy carter and torrijos 
that turn over operation of the canal to panama at the end of the 
century 
noriega has propped up a succession of powerless presidents 
while he controlled the country 
panama has not had an elected government since sept 1 when the 
last presidential and legislative terms ended 
elections were held may 7 to fill those spots but noriega 
annulled the balloting before all the votes were counted 
international observers said the opposition was winning by a 31 
margin 
noriega then named francisco rodriguez a friend since high 
school provisional president and appointed the nations mayors and 
county chairmen to the peoples assembly rodriguezs position was 
expected to become a largely ceremonial post 
assembly members were applauded for attacks on the united 
states one asked the government for guns for all citizens 
because what we have to do here is kill gringos and progringos

a drawing found behind the wall of an oklahoma 
closet is being auctioned as the work of pablo picasso but art 
experts and the woman it supposedly portrays say they doubt its 
authenticity 
the owner of the penandbrush piece jewelry engraver jim 
montgomery of norman okla said friday he had the work checked 
out by a forensic document examiner in oklahoma 
it is up for sale at a weekend auction here by kruse 
international an auburn ind auction house that specializes in 
the sale of vintage cars kruse art director jeff doner said he 
hopes for bids as high as 3 million to 5 million 
picassos former mistress the subject of the drawing doubts it 
is an authentic picasso and one expert said even if authentic it 
would be worth no more than 250000 
montgomery said he was given the work by a young couple he had 
helped financially the couple found the drawing of a young woman 
about 11 years ago tucked between two walls in the back of a 
closet in an apartment they were renovating in norman he said 
recently a friend suggested the drawing might be a picasso and 
montgomery decided to find out 
it started out being a lot of fun and turned out to be a 
tremendous amount of work said montgomery but i had to know 
montgomery had a scientific analysis done by ernest smith a 
forensic document examiner from oklahoma city he verified that the 
ink of the signature was the same as that of the drawing and 
matched the signature with real picasso signatures among other 
things 
montgomery acknowledged the drawing portrait of a young 
girl isnt listed in zervos an extensive catalogue of picasso 
works 
the drawing is said to be of francoise gilot the mother of 
picassos two grown children claude and paloma the late painter 
used ms gilot as a model from 1944 to 1953 when they lived 
together 
but the purported model doubts its authenticity 
if they would want to know if its correct they would ask my 
son or myself or my daughter ms gilot said in a telephone 
interview from new york 
the fact that they didnt ask anybody in the family is not a 
good sign said ms gilot a painter in her own right now married 
to jonas salk the developer of a polio vaccine 
art experts said friday that scientific analysis is generally 
only part of the verification process 
a check of the zervos catalogue ought to be the first step in 
checking out such a work said virgilia pancoast of the 
international foundation for art research in a telephone interview 
from new york 
the thing we would do beyond that the most crucial thing 
would be to go to a picasso expert for an opinion said pancoast 
director of the authentication service for the nonprofit 
organization 
it would seem reasonable to me that anyone attempting to sell 
a work for that price would have the documentation to back it up 
john richardson a friend of picasso who is writing a biography 
of the late artist also said an expert on the artist should have 
been consulted 
its no good going to a forensic expert in oklahoma city he 
said from new york you have to go to a picasso expert they must 
be desperate if they go to such a strange source for an opinion 
but both richardson and pancoast said the drawing could be 
genuine 
even if authentic the piece would be unlikely to reach seven 
figures richardson said 
a very high price would be 250000 he said

the christmas star said to have led 
the three wise men to bethlehem could have been a conjunction of 
jupiter saturn and mars a physicist says 
the three planets were in conjunction appearing from earth to 
have merged in 6 bc about the time of the birth of christ 
said gary henson a physics professor at east tennessee state 
university 
the combined light of all three of them would be brighter than 
any star henson said 
other astronomical phenomenon also have been offered as 
explanation for the christmas story including a supernova or 
exploding star a comet or venus which can shine very brightly at 
times 
one drawback to the conjunction theory henson notes is that 
the wise men were said to be educated in astronomy and should have 
recognized the lining up of the three planets or some other 
recurring astronomical event 
even many thousands of years ago they knew the motions of the 
planets henson said if it was one of those natural objects 
they should have been aware of it

to claim the jolly old elf as one of their own 
tigard city administrator pat reilly said santa like most 
republicans is an older man dedicated to family values 
the fact that st nick has lent his jolly image to marketing 
schemes indicates hes sympathetic to business interests said 
reilly his concept of merit pay gifts only for the nice also 
fits the republican image 
but bill knudsen director of tigard community youth services 
disagreed 
if santa were a true republican knudsen said hed live in 
balmy palm beach instead of the north pole 
an then theres that long white beard 
i mean maybe hed have a pencilthin mustache but everyone 
knows its illegal in america for a republican to wear a beard

visitors who drive hundreds of miles to 
see the tiny town named after st nick are greeted by a sorry santa 
who slumps and groans 
some residents say the condition of the 30foot fiberglass santa 
on the edge of town is embarassing others say its downright 
dangerous 
people stop there all the time to sit their kids on his boots 
and snap pictures said marlin rook wouldnt it be tragic if 
someone was standing there and santa claus fell on them 
santa is slumped forward on crumpled boots with only a steel 
cable to support his weight when the winter wind whistles by the 
notsojolly old elf rocks and moans 
the statue beside highway 245 is the most prominent of two santa 
clauses still standing of four the chamber of commerce erected in 
1981 one was blown over and another located near a high school 
had to be removed after students covered it with graffiti 
last year mrs rook and resident cammie pruss repainted the 
statue but in july santa began to slump forward since then hes 
steadily gotten worse 
now a property is considering loaning money for some of the 
needed repairs estimated at from 2500 to 3000 
a lot of people who live here have lived here all their lives 
and they dont realize how neat it is said mrs pruss who is 
from pittsburgh you dont see these statues of santa claus 
standing around everywhere

the army says it wont give the medal of honor 
to a wisconsin man because it could not prove his claims that he 
singlehandedly killed more than 500 japanese soldiers during world 
war ii 
congressional leaders who pushed for the investigation into the 
claims by david s rubitsky accepted the findings friday and said 
they found the probe fair thorough and conclusive 
lt col terry adkins told reporters the army could not even 
prove fierce fighting occurred dec 12 1942 as claimed by 
rubitsky now 72 
the milton wis man contends he was denied the medal because 
he is jewish 
i could not find any basis of this adkins chief of the 
armys military awards branch said of the antisemitism charge by 
rubitsky i just dont have the information to prove it 
at his home rubitsky said he had not been formally notified of 
the boards ruling im not going to make a statement until im 
damn sure what the facts are myself he said 
were very disappointed but were not giving up yet his 
wife katherine roethe said 
adkins said the decision not to award the medal came after the 
army examined scores of documents including testimony from 
japanese prisoners of war battle logs and interviews 
the officer told congress of the armys findings earlier friday 
and four lawmakers quickly issued a statement saying the 
investigation established as conclusively as possible after half a 
century that there was no mass killing of japanese attackers at 
buna in new guinea in 1942 
the statement was issued from reps les aspin dwis chairman 
of the house armed services committee and nita m lowey dny 
and sens robert w kasten jr rwis and herbert h kohl dwis 
what we are dealing with here is not a lie fabricated by the 
generals and mr rubitsky it is simply the unfortunate result of 
the passage of many years the fogging of many memories and the 
reliving of many difficult memories from a war long past the 
statement said 
rubitsky said he killed up to 600 japanese soldiers in the new 
guinea jungles during a 21hour siege according to adkins 
rubitsky said he believed his action saved his battalion from 
imminent attack and he killed wounded enemy soldiers with a bayonet 
and pistol 
adkins noting the latter claim would have been against the 
geneva war convention said his studies showed there were about 
1000 american troops and 500 japanese soldiers in the area called 
buna and the japanese were in a defensive rather than offensive 
stance 
rubitsky said there was fighting through the night but 
battalion logs indicated it was quiet tours by officers indicated 
little activity in fact adkins said the company commander was 
relieved for failing to follow gen douglas mcarthurs order of 
take buna or dont come back alive 
japanese records likewise dont support the contention that 
intense combat occurred adkins said 
joseph stehling a retired brigadier general signed an 
affidavit outlining rubitskys actions and saying he nominated 
rubitsky for the medal of honor retired gen herbert smith who 
died in september signed a similar affidavit 
another affidavit in the case signed by a military messenger 
said a colonel now dead had denied rubitsky his medal because 
rubitsky was jewish 
in a 1988 interview rubitsky said he had received numerous 
antisemitic phone calls and threats after deciding to fight for 
the medal

a federal safety official says a consumer 
group is misleading the public by criticizing child safety seats 
when in fact they are the single most effective safety device 
ever developed for an automobile 
jeffrey miller deputy administrator of the national highway 
traffic safety administration attacked the center for auto safety 
after the group issued a report friday declaring that millions of 
children are riding in unsafe child restraint seats 
center director clarence ditlow said more than half of the 27 
million child car seats sold over the last eight years are in use 
despite being recalled or failing compliance tests 
the center and parents of children killed or injured in 
allegedly defective child restraint seats blamed the federal safety 
agency for allegedly failing to issue recalls or enforce those it 
does issue 
children ride at risk because recalled seats are not replaced 
or repaired warning labels are approved that never reach owners 
investigations are dropped without recalls and compliance test 
failures are ignored ditlow told a news conference 
but miller said it is categorically false to suggest as mr 
ditlow does that half the seats on the road are dangerous 
the official acknowledged however that only 7 percent of seats 
subject to recalls are actually brought into compliance he said 
recall responses for all products are low and most of the 26 
recalls issued over the last decade involve minor problems 
he said laws requiring child safety seats in all 50 states and 
the district of columbia have pushed usage to 82 percent of 
automobiles with children 
they have saved thousands of lives since their introduction 
miller said at a news conference called to respond to ditlows 
report 
department analysts estimate that wide use of safety seats has 
reduced infant deaths in car accidents by about 70 percent 
miller and ditlow urged consumers concerned about the safety 
of child restraints to call the transportation departments auto 
safety hotline 8004249393 for information about any seat or a 
list of recalls 
ditlows report said 622 children were killed while strapped 
into child safety seats in the last decade the study did not cite 
how many children died because of unsafe seats how many died from 
the improper use of the seats and how many died in accidents in 
which no amount of protection would have saved the child 
among problems cited in recalls were belt fasteners that dont 
hold belts that are too loose buckles that pop open seat shells 
that crack seats that incline too far to hold the child and belt 
choking hazards 
a major child seat manufacturer evenflo said through spokesman 
bob potter that some seats the center named have been on the market 
for years with millions sold and have proved their safety benefit 
ditlow alleged at least 8 million seats have failed safety 
compliance tests but were not investigated or recalled by the 
government while an additional 34 million were investigated but 
not recalled of 56 million subject to recall he said only 
300000 were actually replaced or repaired 
the washingtonbased center for auto safety is a nonprofit 
consumer organization that has been critical of the auto industry 
and has accused the government of softpedaling several safety 
issues in favor of manufacturers

president bush will spare the social security 
administration more staff cuts next year amid complaints the agency 
is already understaffed and unable to provide high quality service 
according to government sources 
john sturdivant president of the american federation of 
government employees which represents agency workers said the 
decision to avoid more cutbacks is a signal that perhaps the 
administration has realized the severity of the problem 
we do not have the necessary people that we need to do the 
type of job we want to do sturdivant said this just keeps the 
problem from getting worse it doesnt solve the problem 
the office of management and budget had proposed that social 
securitys staff be cut from 63000 in the current fiscal year to 
58800 in fiscal 1991 but withdrew the plan at the urging of 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan a department 
source said friday 
sullivan and bush met thursday to discuss the hhs budget for 
next year and the president agreed not to seek staff cuts at 
social security said the hhs source and another government 
official who both spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush presents his proposed 1991 spending plan to congress on 
jan 22 
the social security administrations workforce has been slashed 
by 20 percent in the last six years as part of an effort to 
modernize and streamline operations but employees have complained 
they are overworked and unable to properly serve the public 
the decision to avoid further staff cuts was welcomed by sen 
david pryor dark the chairman of senate special committee on 
aging who said it showed a refreshing change of heart after 
reductions in the reagan years 
ssa services provide a view for millions of american of their 
government in action when service deteriorates as it has in the 
reagan years we hear about it pryor said he credited bush 
sullivan and new social security commissioner gwendolyn king for 
opposing further cuts 
eileen sweeney of the national senior citizens law center also 
welcomed news that further cutbacks would be averted but she 
warned that current staffing levels are inadequate 
at 63000 they do not have the staff to run the program 
sweeney said they have staff that are totally overworked

those health claims that have been multiplying 
on food labels as the american fitness craze has grown would be 
restricted under a plan by the food and drug administration 
the plan would limit claims of health benefits to areas where 
only scientific evidence shows an interaction between diet and 
health fda spokesman bill grigg said friday 
that means companies would be allowed to make claims based on 
evidence that dietary fiber and low fat may reduce risk of cancer 
and heart disease and low sodium may help reduce risk from high 
blood pressure he said 
grigg said any claims would have to make clear that the food was 
part of a total balanced diet 
the fda used to prohibit health claims on food but in 1987 put 
into effect a rule that it now says has proved to be too permissive 
and has allowed companies to make overly broad health claims 
over the last two years manufacturers health claims about the 
role their products play in reducing disease have proliferated 
the fdas proposal is being reviewed by louis sullivan 
secretary of the department of health and human services which 
includes the fda sullivan is expected to approve the plan and send 
it to the white house office of management and budget which 
reviews all regulatory proposals 
if omb clears the proposed rule it could be a year before 
public comment is gathered and a final rule published said grigg 
who added that to some extent the industry would probably follow 
it even before the rule was made final 
fdas proposal is a revised version of a 1988 proposed 
regulation that failed to win omb approval

for the sole purpose of putting out a hearttugging mailing and 
cashing in on the forthcoming checks said metzenbaum who is 
sponsoring legislation to tighten regulation of charities 
officials of leading charities and state officials said lax 
accounting rules have enabled selfdescribed charities to make it 
appear that they provide much more money to education and services 
than they actually do 
west virginia secretary of state ken hechler said one group

connecticut attorney general clarine nardi riddle said new 
accounting rules allow charities to shift a generous portion of 
their funds into administrative functions including fundraising

a charity may claim the mailing has the dual purpose of raising 
money and educating the public even an organization that raises 
10 million through a mailing and pays 975 million to its

the pentagon soon will approve plans submitted 
by 10 commanders for increased activities in the war on drugs a 
spokesman said friday 
defense secretary richard cheney received the reports oct 15 on 
how their commands could become more involved in the support to 
counternarcotics missions said maj david super we cant 
talk about any of the specific recommendations 
military sources said however that future plans included more 
use of awacs surveillance and control aircraft to detect planes 
carrying drugs air deployable groundbased radar systems naval 
combat ships and fixed and mobile sensors 
one marine corps reconnaissance team helping the border patrol 
in arizona exchanged gunfire with marijuana smugglers on horseback 
wednesday night officials said friday 
no one was injured in the wednesday night firefight which 
members of the us group estimated at 30 minutes in duration 
after the alleged smugglers fled on horseback marines and border 
patrol agents who were on foot confiscated about 570 pounds of 
marijuana 
the incident marked the first direct conflict involving marines 
since they began accompanying the border patrol about two weeks ago 
the marines corps referred questions to the immigration and 
naturalization service which did not immediately respond 
the militarys role under cheney is markedly different from his 
predecessor frank carlucci whereas cheney describes the 
militarys participation as crucial carlucci said in june 1988 
he was absolutely opposed to the assignment of a law enforcement 
mission to the department of defense 
meanwhile officials declined to comment on a report by cbs news 
that the pentagon had authorized plans by military units to capture 
fugitive drug criminals in foreign countries 
the washington post said in saturday editions that a justice 
department memo of nov 3 concludes that the federal law forbidding 
use of the military as police officers does not apply outside the 
boundaries of the united states 
the defense departments larger role in counternarcotics began 
last year with a congressional appropriation of 300 million that 
figure was upped to 450 million this year 
congress assigned the pentagon to be the lead and coordinating 
agency for detecting and monitoring aerial and maritime drug 
smuggling creating a network for the intelligence community and 
increasing the work of the national guard 
the los angeles times reported friday that air force analysts 
have suggested the service use highresolution spy satellites to 
provide glimpses of shifting ground bases for drug traffickers 
including their jungle laboratories 
it said navy budget planners recommended shifting some atlantic 
training operations to the caribbean where sailors could keep 
watch on drug trafficking from international waters off colombia 
with peace breaking out all over it might give us something 
to do the newspaper quoted an unidentified twostar general as 
saying 
cheney last month approved the formation of a new antidrug task 
force at fort bliss texas the new group joint task force 6 is 
to deal with drug activity along the southern border it joined two 
other task forces set up earlier this year to stem the flow of 
drugs 
the one at oakland calif detects and monitors aircraft and 
surface vessels suspected of smuggling illegal drugs into the 
united states from the pacific a statement said the one in key 
west fla conducts counternarcotics work in the caribbean 
in its report thursday night cbs news said one unit authorized 
to capture drug fugitives abroad was the armys delta force hostage 
rescue team 
the report said the us military became involved after an 
informant told the us government last summer that pablo escobar 
one of the kingpins of the colombian drug trade was hiding at a 
seaside villa in panama 
troops and helicopters were moved to a us base in puerto rico 
to prepare for an attempted capture labor day weekend but the plan 
was aborted out of suspicion the informant was incorrect it turned 
out escobar was not in panama that weekend cbs said 
us news amp world report magazine published a similar account of 
the escobar plan in last weeks issue

daniel taylor still remembers the 
warning a water department official gave him when environmentalists 
began a series of davidandgoliath court battles with los angeles 
over scenic mono lake 
its good that youre young the official said because 
youll be old when its resolved 
those environmentalists have reached or are approaching middle 
age but thanks to a series of favorable court decisions they have 
victory in sight says taylor western regional representative for 
the audubon society 
what once seemed a quixotic struggle to save a woebegone lake 
has gained the backing of court rulings and legislative action in 
recent years as southern californians began to come to grip with 
environmental concerns over their water and air 
the original question was will we win now its a question of 
when will we win said taylor 38 who became involved in the 
case in the late 1970s its clear that mono lake will not die 
mono was formed a million years ago in a volcanic area just east 
of what is now yosemite national park about 260 miles north of los 
angeles and due east of san francisco 
the lake which in its heyday covered about 80 square miles is 
best known for its high salt level and oddly shaped limestone 
formations tufa that stand cactuslike along part of its shore 
mark twain called the place the dead sea of the west 
naturalist john muir saw it as a country of wonderful contrasts 
hot deserts bounded by snowladen mountains frost and fire 
working together in the making of beauty 
congress created a national forest scenic area at the lake in 
1984 
but mono has been shrinking since los angeles began diverting 
water in 1941 using an aqueduct system to tap tributary streams 
the diversions have dropped the lakes level about 40 feet and 
reduced its size to about 60 square miles environmentalists say 
that if the trend continues the lake will be turned into an 
alkali wasteland unable to support monos brine shrimp or 
various birds 
but recent court rulings and legislation indicate the 
environmentalists may be able to claim victory 
there have been very important developments that signal that 
it really is a question of how soon rather than whether mono lake 
will be protected said martha davis executive director of the 
mono lake committee an environmental group created in 1978 that 
now has 20000 duespaying members 
theres also much more work ahead of us to really translate 
some of the legal and political victories of this year into 
permanent protection for the lake 
duane georgeson assistant general manager of the los angeles 
department of water and power says its a little early for 
anyone to claim a victory unless youre interested only in counting 
court orders 
but he says the city recognizes that at some point there will 
have to be some reductions in our diversions 
environmentalists won a major victory in 1983 when the state 
supreme court ruled that water uses could be altered to protect the 
public trust 
they scored this year when state courts said that los angeles 
licenses to export water from the mono lake basin must be revised 
to require the city to release fishsustaining flows in four 
streams that feed the lake 
also this year a superior court judge issued a preliminary 
injunction that in effect forced the city to stop taking water 
from the basin the injunction remains in force through march and 
environmentalists say they will seek to extend it 
the legislature with backing from environmentalists and los 
angeles voted this year to create a 60 million fund to find ways 
to replace water the city takes from the mono basin 
the author of one of the bills democratic assemblyman phil 
isenberg said the cityenvironmental group support for the 
legislation signaled the beginning of the end to an acrimonious 
50year water war 
los angeles has seen the handwriting on the wall he said 
psychologically this is a new la these are folks who dont 
like to be portrayed as rapers of the environment they would like 
to get out from under it

authorities said 
at a news conference at andrews air force base the lawmakers 
praised barco for his courage in the face of bombings and 
assassinations that have chipped away at that nations government 
you have to be there to understand the kind of fear that we 
saw said rep william hughes dnj 
they visited the site of last weeks deadly bomb blast that 
destroyed the colombian intelligence and security directorate and 
lawmakers visited a hospital where victims are recuperating 
all agreed that despite death threats against top colombian 
officials president bush should attend a planned feb 15 drug 
summit in the colombian city of cartagena to demonstrate us 
support for barcos war against drug lords 
rep benjamin a gilman rny called the bush visit a 
strong symbolic gesture that would improve colombian morale 
we will collect our forces in the congress to provide the type 
of resources that will be necessary to make this war victorious 
said rangel 
hughes said he assured barco the united states would assist 
colombia by restricting the flow of usmade assault weapons and 
cocaine processing chemicals to south america limiting 
moneylaundering activities in the united states and providing 
greater protection for witnesses willing to testify against drug 
lords 
aides kept the twoday trip secret because of concerns the 
congressmen could become the targets of cocaine traffickers

the bush administration will increase spending 
in fiscal 1991 for labor department job training programs and for 
enforcement of pension and workersafety laws 
the increases will be included in the budget request the white 
house sends congress on jan 22 for the fiscal year that begins 
next oct 1 sources told the associated press on friday 
the labor department lost in a bid for a major funding boost for 
a program designed to help dislocated workers but welcomed the 
overall spending and will not appeal the office of management and 
budget decisions to president bush said administration officials 
who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the sources said the bottom line for the labor department budget 
could change if some other major departments the defense 
department among them win their appeals to the president for 
funding above the levels decided by the budget office that would 
cause budget planners to look at other departments to recoup funds 
the spending agreement for the labor department includes planned 
funding boosts for the occupational safety and health 
administration and the pension and welfare benefits administration 
the figures are what the administration plans to request in 
budget authority actual appropriations are determined after 
congress adopts spending limits 
the pension and welfare benefits administration oversees the 
nations nearly 2 trillion private pension system and has been 
criticized by the departments inspector general who says the 
system is ripe for fraud because of inadequate oversight and 
incomplete auditing of pension funds 
labor secretary elizabeth dole asked for a more than 6 million 
spending boost for the pension agency according to the sources 
they said the budget office accepted a figure very close to 
the departments request and that as a result the agency would be 
able to hire 100 additional enforcement workers in fiscal 1991 
the department requested 157 million in additional funding for 
the occupational safety and health administration which has a 
budget authorization of 270 million for the current year again 
the sources declined to provide the amount approved by the budget 
office but said it was essentially what we asked for and would 
allow for the hiring of an undetermined number of new inspectors 
and other enforcement personnel 
also included in departments agreement with the budget office 
is 250 million in additional money for the job training 
partnership act which has a budget of about 17 billion this year 
all of the new money would fund a package of job training 
amendments pending before congress and endorsed by bush earlier 
this year those changes are expected to be passed early next year

terrance wear will remain as the president of 
the federal legal services corp after surviving a vote for his 
ouster pushed by liberal members of the agencys board of directors 
former rep john erlenborn rill named to the panel by 
president bush last month cast the deciding vote friday against a 
motion to dismiss wear after a daylong meeting in which the 
conservative presidents performance was examined 
the 11member panel discussed wears use of outside counsel and 
lobbying of the white house in connection with nominations for the 
board the panel also questioned wears hiring and payment of the 
agencys inspector general without prior board approval 
erlenborn and texas attorney j blakely hall who had previously 
served on the board were appointed during the yearend recess of 
congress thus avoiding senate confirmation 
fridays meeting was the latest in a continuing battle between 
two factions on the board which oversees the independent agency 
that offers legal help to the nations poor 
the agency has been the subject of controversy since 1981 when 
conservatives targeted it for abolishment 
now those conservatives buttressed by wear want to limit the 
agencys field attorneys activities in classaction lawsuits 
against the government over welfare and other social programs 
according to carolyn stewart of the national legal aid and 
defenders association 
conservatives held a 65 majority on the board until two 
vacancies recently occurred according to terry roach an 
independent consultant and longtime lsc observer 
the balance briefly tipped to a 54 majority in favor of the 
broader range of activities and one board member thomas smegal 
unsuccessfully tried to oust wear

range wars are nothing new to ranchers but 
hitandrun vandalism that the fbi blames on environmental 
terrorists is igniting new conflict in the west 
its a case of ecological terrorism fbi agent richard 
whitaker said of a growing number of incidents including 
castration of cattle sabotage of farm machinery freeing of farm 
animals and possibly death threats against a rancher and a 
government animal manager 
their basic goal is to eradicate the rancher whitaker said 
the attacks have become more prevalent in nevada california and 
arizona in recent months some ranchers say damage they previously 
thought was the work of pranksters or hunters may be a concerted 
effort by animal rights activists and environmental groups 
these things are terrorist activities says jim connelley 
president of the nevada cattlemens association these people 
have total disregard for the law they are criminal and terrorist 
in nature 
animal rights and environmental groups such as animal liberation 
front and earth first have been accused of the hitandrun 
attacks which have been stepped up in the last 18 months whitaker 
said in a recent interview here 
the animal liberation front best known for freeing research 
animals and vandalizing laboratories is seeking the elimination 
of the livestock industry spokeswoman margo tannenbaum said 
the reason why the animal liberation front is conducting 
economic sabotage to the poultry and livestock industries is to 
encourage those involved to quit and follow other pursuits she 
said 
earth first adherents may be responsible for some of the acts 
said spokesman lynn jacobs in tucson but jacobs denied knowledge 
of specific attacks by followers of the militant environmental 
group 
i dont advocate that anyone break the law unless they feel 
its the right thing to do jacobs said 
the fbis whitaker said any livestock operator is a potential 
target for militant vegetarians who shun meat dairy products eggs 
or cheese refuse to wear leather or wool and think others should 
follow suit 
among the incidents in nevada according to cattleman connelley 
are castration of bulls kept for breeding cutting of fences and 
water pipelines toppling of troughs and water tanks and damage to 
windmills and wells 
pam neal executive vice president of the arizona cattlemens 
association in phoenix said she received a death threat on her 
telephone answering machine a week after she testified at a 
congressional hearing in favor of multiple uses of public land she 
blames the threat on ecological terrorists 
darrell juve the arizona director of a us agriculture 
department program to kill predators and diseased animals said he 
also received a death threat and later a military practice 
grenade was tossed into offices near his 
ranchers want congress and state legislatures to make it a 
felony to disrupt food production in any way 
my assessment is that theyre totally misguided they dont 
have the foggiest idea of the benefits of the livestock industry 
connelley said of the activists we are the original ecologists 
were the ones who originally came west took it on ourselves to 
produce something from nothing we are dependent on the ecology 
some of these people are cooped up in an apartment in the big 
city and the closest they ever get to nature is a sunset magazine 
they tend to get a little misguided 
animal liberation front members prefer releasing animals to 
damaging equipment ms tannenbaum said each year they try to raid 
turkey farms before thanksgiving and rabbit farms before easter 
front activists released 300 wild horses from a federal bureau 
of land management lot in northern california and beef cattle from 
a feedlot in coalinga calif last year she said 
the group also claimed responsibility for freeing more than 600 
partridges in may from pens belonging to chukars unlimited a 
hunters group near elko nev that keeps the birds to be shot 
many of the released birds were killed by vehicles on a nearby 
highway

president bush will keep the airborne command 
post that flies continuously in case of nuclear attack despite a 
pentagon recommendation that the flights be grounded part of the 
time 
an administration official who disclosed bushs decision to the 
associated press on condition he not be identified said the 
president and national security adviser brent scowcroft discussed 
the matter after word of the pentagons plans appeared in friday 
editions of the new york times 
defense secretary dick cheney telegraphed the decision earlier 
friday telling reporters i dont believe well go forward with 
it i think well continue to fly it as we have in the past 
they decided that to end the flights would send the wrong 
signal at this time that we may be cutting back in military 
capability the official said 
the administrations plans to seek lower defense budgets have 
been known for weeks 
a decreased soviet threat and the prospect of saving 20 million 
a year were cited as support for the proposal to ground the command 
post known as looking glass 
the post carries a general of the strategic air command and 
supporting staff to issue battle orders in case of a nuclear war 
that kills or disables the president and other command authorities 
the looking glass planes have been flying since 1961 the air 
force proposed that they fly only part of the time with the 
general and his staff on ground alert the rest of the time 
the planes fly from offutt air force base in nebraska

the veil of secrecy over the governments 
38yearold program at the nevada test site has lifted some in 
part thanks to the efforts of two lawyers seeking compensation for 
radiation victims since 1970 
brothers alan and larry johns have unearthed topsecret 
government files that show workers were repeatedly exposed to 
dangerous levels of radiation but seldom told of the threat it 
presented 
the documents tell stories of the cavalier approach to radiation 
that prevailed in the early nuclear years attitudes that might be 
funny if it werent for the tragedy involved they talk of managers 
who told miners to drink beer to flush tritium from their bodies 
and workers so unconcerned about the radiation they received that 
they would hide their exposure badges so they wouldnt be pulled 
off the job 
that happened all the time johns said friday they would 
just pretend to lose them so they could continue working and not 
lose any money 
in 1961 the documents show miners yanked from tunnels used 
during nuclear weapons testing were told to drink as much beer as 
possible to rid their bodies of radiation 
that incident was retold by a miner in an affidavit and backed 
up by tunnel logs prepared by reynolds electrical and engineering 
co the prime contractor at the site 
it was their way to flush out the tritium said alan johns 
on thursday theyd give them a beer allotment and let them have 
all the beer they could drink they reimbursed one miner who turned 
in 25 in receipts for beer over a weekend and that was when beer 
was a dollar a sixpack 
from the time a 10kiloton nuclear bomb leaked a cloud of 
radiation that enveloped several hundred workers three miles from 
the blast site in 1970 the two attorneys have waged a protracted 
legal struggle on behalf of those who believe they got cancer from 
radiation released by nuclear bombs 
today they represent two cases involving 200 workers who 
allegedly died from cancer caused by the radiation and another 18 
who contracted the disease the suits continue to bounce between 
various courts with no settlement in sight 
its just like a treadmill it just keeps going from one step 
to another alan johns said the radiation program is the 
governments sacred cow theyve fought it every step of the way 
alan johns won a major ruling in the two separate cases in 
october when a federal judge in las vegas said the governments 
nuclear testing program can be held liable for not providing for 
the health and safety of employees at the testing facility 
if the ruling stands up on yet another appeal to the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals the widows of two men exposed to 
radiation in the 1970 baneberry nuclear test leak could get a new 
trial on their claims in the first trial in 1979 a judge found 
the government might have been negligent but was not responsible 
for the cancers 
while the cases have cost the two former prosecutors countless 
hours of time and made them almost no money over the years they 
have uncovered some nuggets on how the government conducted itself 
during the first two decades of testing at the nations nuclear 
proving grounds 
in 1953 two years after testing began in the barren desert some 
100 miles north of las vegas documents show that commissioners on 
the atomic energy commission predecessor of the department of 
energy advised lowering the governments annual safety limit 
which was 12 rems for radiation doses 
the commissions chief health officer advised against it saying 
it would require major changes in the way nuclear weapons were 
tested at the site 
the current safety level is now 5 rems 
granted things would be done differently today but thats the 
way life is said doe spokesman chris west the government was 
following the existing safety standards of the day as you learn 
more about the environment and health you change your standards to 
deal with the new information

the smithsonian institution for the first time 
in its 143year history is seeking corporate support for its vast 
educational and research activities as a permanent supplement to 
federal financing 
the smithsonian recently announced the creation of a corporation 
associate program intended to raise more than 1 million annually 
through corporate contributions or membership dues 
the founding chairman of the new fundraising venture which 
starts next year will be roberto c goizueta chairman and chief 
executive officer of the cocacola co 
cocacola pledged the maximum 25000 in membership dues under 
the new corporate program which allows companies to cosponsor a 
major special event at the smithsonian corporations choosing to 
pay annual dues of 10000 will be entitled to vip treatment at 
smithsonian events 
in the past corporate support of the smithsonian has been 
confined mostly to underwriting specific museum exhibits or 
projects the new program is intended to generate unrestricted 
funds for the whole range of smithsonian activities including its 
14 museums and art galleries the national zoo and various other 
educational and research facilities 
smithsonian officials said the institutions current

us national income figured on the basis of 
population rose slightly in 1988 but was far outpaced by japan 
the world bank says 
per capita income in the united states last year was 19780 
compared with 18580 in 1987 in japan the income rose from 
15840 to 21040 the world bank reported friday the bank gave 
all incomes in us dollars 
the world bank arrives at its figures by dividing the value of a 
countrys total production the gross national product by its 
population per capita income thus includes people without income 
such as children and nonwage income such as returns on 
investments 
the swiss continued to rank first in per capita income with a 
1988 average of 27260 up from 21310 in 1987 
mozambique ranked lowest among the 152 members of the world bank 
with a 1988 annual per capita income of 100 
the united states which in 1987 ranked second only to 
switzerland in per capita income was fifth last year behind 
switzerland japan iceland and norway 
much of the rise in the japanese income can be attributed to an 
increase in the value of the yen in comparison with the dollar as 
well as to increased japanese production elsewhere differences 
could be linked to shifts in the value of the dollar compared with 
other currencies the dollar has been rising in 1989 after a fall 
that began in 1985

a new study released says the economic 
expansion of the 1980s has least benefited us latinos 
nearly onefifth of hispanic families are living in poverty as 
the decade ends according to the study released friday by the 
national council of la raza 
the study found widespread poverty among hispanic families led 
by women deepening hardships for marriedcouple families and 
significant numbers of poor latino children 
hispanics made many gains in the 1980s politically and 
socially especially in visibility and growth said la raza 
president raul yzaguirre but unfortunately the economic picture 
for hispanics worsened at the same time 
la raza a nonprofit hispanic research and advocacy 
organization said hispanics were concentrated in lowwage jobs 
overrepresented in industries with declining employment and more 
likely to lose their jobs through plant closings 
hispanics also are the most undereducated group in the country 
with only 51 percent of latinos 25 and older completing four years 
of high school or more compared with 78 percent of nonhispanics 
the increasing number of hispanic families led by women is also 
a factor as those families tend to be poor the study said in 
1980 218 percent of hispanic families were led by women but by 
1988 womenled families accounted for 234 percent of hispanic 
families

marines working with us border patrol 
agents exchanged gunfire with a group of drug smugglers on 
horseback in the first battle between troops and smugglers since 
the military began border patrols officials said 
the marines did not shoot to kill and no one was injured in the 
halfhour fight wednesday night outside this border city officials 
said friday 
the marines were part of a 50soldier contingent who have been 
assisting border patrol agents primarily in surveillance since 
the program started two weeks ago lt col ron stokes said from 
marine headquarters in washington 
the contingent was on its way to an observation point about 
three miles from nogales when the horsemen were spotted stokes 
said 
the border patrol agent ordered the marines to fire a flare to 
light up the area stokes said with the ground lighted the men on 
horseback began shooting at the marines 
the marines armed with m16 assault rifles returned the 
volley firing over the heads of smugglers in order to try to 
scare their horses stokes said 
after the riders fled marines and border patrol agents 
confiscated about 570 pounds of marijuana 
bob maynes a spokesman for sen dennis deconcini dariz said 
the firefight underlined the reasons why federal troops should be 
involved against drug smugglers 
the willingness of drug smugglers to fire across an 
international border when no shots had been fired at them is a 
clear indication of the dangerous kind of individuals were dealing 
with maynes said 
the us immigration and naturalization service which directs 
the border patrol announced in october that it planned to use 
marines to aid in drug interdiction 
at the time hispanic rights groups voiced concerns that marines 
on the border would prompt increased violence and human rights 
abuses because marines are not trained in civilian law enforcement 
the mexican government also raised concerns 
the marines do not have the authority to arrest people or 
conduct searches and seizures stokes said 
local police said they were not notified of the gunfight 
capt tony estrada of the nogales ariz police said the 
confrontation was news to me until i received a call from a 
reporter 
both city police and the sheriffs department are normally 
notified by federal officials when shootings take place in their 
areas

redoubt volcano belched an 8milehigh 
cloud of ash that turned day to night in a town 200 miles away and 
apparently clogged all four engines of an airliner forcing an 
emergency landing 
the mountain 115 miles southwest of anchorage which ended a 
23year slumber with an eruption thursday erupted twice friday 
and could continue to spew ash said seismologists with the us 
geological survey 
the huge plume of ash was tentatively blamed for the failure of 
all four engines on a boeing 747 passenger jet that made a safe 
emergency landing here at 1225 pm friday the federal aviation 
administration said 
engines on the klm royal dutch airlines plane traveling from 
amsterdam stopped after the aircraft passed through volcanic ash 
undetected by radar faa spokeswoman mary lou wojtalik said 
the plane fell 13000 feet before all engines were restarted and 
flight 867 landed without injury to the 245 people aboard she said 
the massive ash cloud drifted at noon over the town of 
talkeetna a staging point for mount mckinley climbers that lies 
about 200 miles northeast of the volcano blotting out the sun and 
depositing 3 inches of ash on the ground 
it blotted out the sun said brad ault a dispatcher with 
the state troopers it was like night for about an hour 
redoubt erupted early friday morning and again shortly after 10 
am scientists from the us geological survey were unable to 
reach the remote site in lake clark national park by plane because 
of bad weather and had to depend on instruments that measure ground 
motion to track the eruptions 
the volcano is of a type that erupts explosively throwing ash 
and rocks skyward 
more eruptions are possible said usgs geologist don richter 
i dont like to use the word normal but a group of 
eruptions is typical of a volcano richter said 
fridays latemorning eruption shook the ground for miles said 
charlotte rowe a seismologist at the university of alaska 
fairbanks geophysical institute the corrosive ash fallout bypassed 
anchorage and drifted to the northeast as it had a day earlier 
much of the cloud which reached heights of 40000 feet or 
about 8 miles dissipated 
the alaska division of emergency services said any remaining ash 
was expected to move into canada then turn south 
talkeetna bartender shannon tobiason said most people remained 
indoors 
this place is covered tobiason said theres about 3 
inches of ash on the car windshields everything here is brown 
and there is a sulfur smell 
in anchorage the international airport remained open although 
some carriers suspended or reduced operations the faa continued to 
restrict flying in the area of the volcano the agency said the klm 
plane was where it was supposed to be when it passed through the 
ash

turned out to recreate the festivities surrounding the premiere of 
gone with the wind on the 50th anniversary of the release of 
the civil war movie classic 
some of the original cast was on hand for the gala 
repremiere friday night but the movie itself was the star of 
the show 
the crowd applauded everything from the title as it swept 
across the screen to the stars names as the credits rolled 
andy diskes of peabody mass who came dressed in a confederate 
uniform didnt care that he had seen the movie many times before 
this time was special 
i thought that by being here i could be part of its history 
he said 
ten surviving cast members all had minor roles were on hand 
olivia de havilland who played melanie wilkes sent a letter to 
be read to the audience in which she said stars clark gable and 
vivien leigh would live on through the film and ill be with you 
too 
gable who played rhett butler and miss leigh who portrayed 
scarlett ohara both died in the 1960s margaret mitchell the 
atlanta author whose pulitzer prizewinning novel became one of the 
worlds most popular movies died in 1949

miss mcqueen was barred from the 1939 premiere held in a 
whitesonly theater but on friday night she entertained the crowd 
with lines from her role and a song to the tune of the tara 
theme 
fans from as far away as australia came for the event but the 
crowd was far smaller than the hundreds of thousands who turned out 
for the dec 15 1939 premiere at loews grand theatre 
this time only a few hundred people gathered in cold cloudy 
weather to watch a recreation of the motorcade 
and the parade didnt head for the loews grand torn down after 
it was gutted by fire in 1978 its standin was the fox theatre an 
ornate 1920s movie palace restored in the 1970s 
before the screening the cast members helped cut a huge cake in 
the shape of the plantation tara joining them was daniel selznick 
son of the late gone with the wind producer david o selznick 
ted turner the media mogul who acquired the movie in 1985 when 
he bought mgmua entertainment corps huge film empire had little 
to say at the screening 
but thursday night at an anniversary ball at the georgia 
international convention and trade center he had a quip for those 
who disliked his practice of adding color to many classic 
blackandwhite movies

a lesbian has lost a lawsuit for joint 
custody and visitation rights to a girl born to her former lover 
through artificial insemination with sperm from the plaintiffs 
brother 
the plaintiff terri sabol sought the rights of a parent and 
even offered to pay child support 
ruling friday after a nonjury trial superior court judge dana 
henry said the case ventured into uncharted legal ground and 
added it is absolutely imperative that the legislature 
reexamine its laws 
im shocked really shocked said sabol 33 owner of a long 
beach hair salon and the only party in the case who was publicly 
identified 
the child was referred to as baby b and her mother was 
identified only as susan the trial was conducted behind closed 
doors as is usual in cases determining parental rights but the 
judge ruled in open court 
sabol will appeal said her attorney gloria allred 
we believe that persons who are gay and lesbian have the right 
to be parents ms allred said ms sabol became a parent in 
the only way that she could 
allred argued that her client deserved parental rights under a 
legal doctrine that recognizes a parentchild bond between a child 
and person who acts as a parent but is neither the biological or 
adoptive parent 
henry ruled sabol failed to prove such a bond existed 
the mothers lawyer glen schwartz said the ruling was 
consistent with state law 
testimony showed susan was the mother and steve sabol was the 
biological father 
sabol and her life partner decided in march 1985 they wanted 
a child part of the decision was that the other woman would carry 
the baby because sabol was in a better position to be the bread 
winner allred said 
sabols brother steve donated sperm for the artificial 
insemination procedure which was performed by sabol 
the other woman became pregnant in april 1986 and a girl was 
born dec 16 1986 the childs parentage made sabol the girls 
aunt 
allred said sabol supported her partner through her pregnancy 
and served as a parent until the womens relationship broke up in 
july 1988

gen augusto pinochet promised support to 
his newly elected civilian successor but said that the military 
would keep watch over the system he set up during his 16 years of 
iron rule 
pinochets nationwide address showed that the voters defeat of 
his governments policies in balloting thursday would not mean that 
the rightwing army commander would easily turn over total power to 
presidentelect patricio aylwin 
pinochet said we offer all our collaboration not only out of 
respect for those who triumphed in yesterdays elections but also 
out of loyalty to the countrys higher interests which have always 
guided my actions 
he added that the armed forces would rule until the last day 
of their mandate and then would assume a watchdog role to 
guarantee the institutional order of the republic 
a triumphant aylwin told hundreds of thousands of supporters 
friday night that he would insist on the obedience of pinochet and 
the armed forces once he takes office in march 
we want to see the armed forces dedicated to their 
professional duties disciplined obedient recovering the respect 
of all their countrymen aylwin said 
the election was intended to bring back democracy to the last 
south american country still ruled by the military 
pinochet who seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled 
elected president salvador allende was forced to call the election 
after losing a referendum in october 1988 chileans in that vote 
rejected a military proposal that he remain as president until 1997 
in washington the state department congratulated the people and 
the government of chile for the free and honest elections 
the high voter turnout and the orderly and peaceful way in 
which the elections were carried out testify to the strong desire 
of the chilean people to freely elect their political leadership 
the department said in a statement 
late friday there were sporadic clashes with police who 
dispersed small groups of rockthrowing youths with tear gas and 
water cannons police reported at least seven officers hurt and 
dozens of demonstrators detained in the skirmishes downtown which 
lasted well into the night witnesses saw several injured civilians 
taken off in ambulances 
aylwin led the ticket of a 17party centerleft coalition that 
has fought for an end to pinochets authoritarian rule pinochet 
however has vowed to stay on as army commander 
a special constitutional clause bars any new govermment from 
ousting pinochet from the army command for eight years 
aylwin has maintained that the military should limit itself to 
national defense and security matters 
in a news conference the presidentelect declared his 
government will not be a puppet democracy 
he also said he plans to meet with the armed forces before his 
inauguration 
one of the most delicate issues in future militarycivilian 
relations is expected to be an investigation of human rights abuses 
during military rule 
we dont have a wish of revenge but of truth and justice 
aylwin said friday he also said anyone who committed abuses may be 
brought to justice including pinochet 
the 74yearold general says he will not accept human rights 
trials of servicemen and has warned if one of my men is 
touched the state of law will be broken 
aylwin 71 a christian democrat and former senate leader won 
552 percent of the vote progovernment candidate hernan buchi 
finished with 294 percent and a populist businessman francisco

in what amounted to a public apology mikhail s 
gorbachev and soviet leaders today eulogized andrei d sakharov as 
a man of honesty and sincerity who suffered great injustice at 
the hands of previous rulers 
an obituary signed by gorbachev five other members of the 
ruling communist party politburo and 50 other leading officials and 
scholars was printed along with a picture of sakharov on page 4 of 
the party daily pravda 
such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and 
scientists and pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 nobel 
peace prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a 
funeral commission in a black box on its front page 
sakharov 68 died thursday night in his study just hours after 
urging fellow members of the congress of peoples deputies to 
create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its 
sevendecade strangehold on political power 
a distinguished scientist and public figure a man of honesty 
and sincerity has passed away the obituary said everything 
that andrei dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience his 
deep humanitarian convictions 
the obituary noted sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of 
gorky about 250 miles east of moscow from 1980 to 1986 
gross injustices were permitted in relation to ad 
sakharov it said 
it was signed by gorbachev and fellow politburo members nikolai 
i ryzhkov vadim a medvedev lev n zaikov alexander n yakovlev 
and vitaly i vorotnikov 
however the signatures of several other politburo members 
including kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov and leading conservative 
yegor k ligachev were missing absence of their signatures could 
signify that the disagreed with part of the obituary 
ligachev interviewed by the tass news agency on friday had 
said he disagreed with sakharov but respected him 
it was leonid i brezhnev now blamed by gorbachev for 
permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the soviet system 
who exiled sakharov for criticizing the soviet intervention in 
afghanistan 
gorbachev called sakharov in gorky in december 1986 and told him 
he could return to moscow 
the soviet leader told reporters at the congress of peoples 
deputies that sakharovs death was a great loss 
even though the two often tangled at the congress gorbachev 
said he respected sakharov he was not some sort of political 
intriguer the soviet president said friday 
gorbachev said he would attend sakharovs funeral monday 
afternoon in southwest moscows vostryakovskoye cemetery 
several hundred people gathered outside sakharovs apartment 
building friday evening holding candles and wreathing his 
photograph in flowers memorial services were scheduled sunday at 
the citys main youth center and on monday at the lebedev physics 
institute where sakharov worked and the academy of sciences of 
which he was a leading member 
the popular nighttime tv program vzglad showed a brief 
interview with his widow yelena bonner discussing the funeral 
arrangements 
the obituary also praised sakharovs vision as a scientist 
which made him the youngestever member of the academy of sciences 
at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the 
soviet hydrogen bomb 
but it said that sakharov realized the danger of the weapon he 
had helped create 
working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction ad 
sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide 
production and testing and stubbornly placed before the government 
the question of limiting such tests it said 
but at that time his appeals were not accepted it said 
he kept these same positions in the future

citing national security concerns a federal 
judge refused to release details about the us governments 
investigation into the bombing of pan am flight 103 for use in a 
lawsuit against the airline 
judge thomas c platt of us district court said friday the 
information may have to be withheld until criminal investigations 
here and overseas are completed which may delay the civil case 
for years 
i dont want to be responsible for another airline crash he 
said at a hearing 
pan am attorney anthony a dean argued that the case should be 
delayed until the court can consider all the evidence about the 
bomb which destroyed boeing 747 over lockerbie scotland on dec 
21 killing 259 on the plane and 11 on the ground 
lee kreindler the lead attorney for relatives of about 150 of 
the dead said it would be unfair to make the families wait that 
long for their day in court the plaintiffs are seeking amounts 
ranging from 1 million to 25 million 
platt said he felt it might be a waste of time to begin the 
trial without the government information only to have it released 
later 
pan am last month subpoenaed six government agencies including 
the fbi and the cia seeking documents to use in defending itself 
against the civil lawsuits 
platt said some of the documents he had reviewed contained 
information that he felt might jeopardize american interests 
he instructed justice department lawyer john connors who sat in 
on the proceedings to seek guidance from national security 
officials in washington and report back 
i want you to find out if you released what evidence you have 
now without mentioning names whether they would regard that as 
breaching national security platt said 
no date was set for connors to report to platt 
outside the courtroom dean said he felt the documents may show 
that parties other than pan am possibly even government agencies 
shared responsibility

so many exxon oiltanker crew members applied for 
a company offer to pay them to quit their jobs that a possible 
tankercrew shortage could occur a company spokesman said 
exxon sought the resignations of 76 licensed officers and 71 
unlicensed crew members to make up for a cutback in ships and crew 
sizes but nearly twice the number of unlicensed crew members 
applied for the buyout said spokesman tom gillette in houston 
the number of officers who signed up for the buyout wasnt 
available he said 
the company conducted the buyout by seniority on nov 22 when 
it named the 147 who would be bought out of their jobs said john 
hillman vice president of the seamans union at exxon 
but since the buyout other crew members and officers who were 
not named on the list have quit because they are fed up with exxon 
policies hillman said 
gillette said exxon may have to delay some of the buyouts since 
so many people have quit he did not say how many had quit 
about 800 people worked in the companys tanker operation before 
the buyout plan started 
gillette said he believes people are leaving the company for 
other opportunities and because the buyout offering as much as six 
months pay was so attractive 
exxon has cut the number of tankers it operates from 20 to 13 
because it curtailed shipments on the route from alaska to the gulf 
coast officials said 
the tanker exxon valdez spilled about 11 million gallons of oil 
into alaskas prince william sound on march 24 in the worst oil 
spill in the countrys history

top tv production team marcy carsey and tom werner their company 
makes nbcs the cosby show and abcs roseanne

tristar in 1985 and has been head of tristar pictures since 
march

art buchwalds attorney said paramount 
pictures stole a story proposal by the humorist and turned it into 
a hit eddie murphy movie that grossed 150 million without making 
buchwald a dime 
in opening statements friday at the trial of buchwalds lawsuit 
paramounts attorney denied the allegations and accused buchwalds 
lawyer of leading mr buchwald and other creative people down a 
primrose path to destroy this industry 
attorney pierce odonnell who represents the columnist said 
buchwald was victimized by the making of coming to america and 
deserves substantial punitive damages he is asking for 5 million 
odonnell told superior court judge harvey schneider he would 
prove that paramount took buchwalds 1983 script idea entitled 
king for a day and transformed it into the 1988 comedy which 
grossed more than 150 million 
murphy the attorney said has already netted 22 million from 
the film and paramount collected more than 50 million in 
distribution fees but the studio refused to pay buchwald and 
producer alain bernheim 250000 plus a small share of profits 
under their original contract 
an attorney for paramount robert draper ridiculed the idea 
that buchwalds script idea was plagiarized 
he said it was so different that it never occurred to ned tanen 
then head of the studio that there was any similarity between the 
two ideas both of which dealt with an african prince coming to the 
united states 
draper said murphy who is not a party in the suit has 
admitted that he saw buchwalds proposal but murphy said he 
couldnt tell whether it influenced him subconsciously in writing 
his own script for coming to america

solidarity leader lech walesa has endorsed 
a tough economic reform package that the government acknowledges 
will cause unemployment and cut incomes 
the solidarity trade union chairmans approval came two days 
before prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and his cabinet submit the 
plan sunday to parliament 
walesa received a threemember government delegation at his 
gdansk office on friday and said later he supported the 
presented proposals according to a statement released by an aide 
the statement said walesa also expressed the need for 
immediate and radical changes in ownership relations a 
reference to the more than 90 percent of polands nonfarm economy 
controlled by the state 
aleksander hall a cabinet minister in charge of contacts with 
political parties and top officials of the finance and labor 
ministries journeyed to gdansk to present the governments 
socioeconomic program to walesa 
walesa who put together the parliamentary coalition that 
allowed solidarity to take contol of the government from the 
communists in august rejected any office for himself but retains 
close supervision of the government and its programs 
on tuesday walesa caused a sensation in poland when he said the 
need for reform was so urgent that lawmakers should not review the 
package at all but simply give mazowiecki and his government 
special powers to carry out whatever reforms are necessary 
a poll in the solidarity newspaper gazeta wyborcza on friday 
said 50 percent of respondents favored walesas proposal while 16 
percent were definitely against the rest were uncertain 
however the government responded that it wants parliament to 
approve the program because it will require such extensive public 
sacrifices 
the aims of the program are to restructure the polish economy to 
encourage private enterprise and competition choke off rampant 
inflation that reached an estimated 900 percent in 1989 and open 
the economy to foreign trade 
mazowieckis cabinet met through the week to put finishing 
touches on the program which includes tax increases and sharp 
spending cuts to bring the state budget into balance 
government subsidies to enterprises are being cut credit is 
being tightened and coal and energy prices are going up to reflect 
world price levels the changes are expected to squeeze inefficient 
enterprises and force them into bankruptcies 
real incomes are expected to drop 20 percent industrial 
production by 5 percent and the gross national product by 2 to 3 
percent 
many workers are expected to become unemployed at least 
temporarily and the government is creating its first program of 
jobless compensation and retraining it also plans financial aid 
for children and pensioners 
a major aspect of the reform is making the polish currency fully 
convertible inside poland against hard currencies 
the package has been prepared in consultation with the 
international monetary fund which is poised to sign a letter of 
intent next week on an economic adjustment agreement with poland 
including standby loans of 700 million 
the loans are conditioned on poland carrying out its reforms 
once the imf has certified the polish program as meeting the imfs 
tough standards the world bank and western governments are to 
weigh in with other loans worth up to 35 billion

gonzalo rodriguez gacha was a pig farmer 
and bartender before he found a trade that made him one of the 
richest and most dangerous men in the world 
the cocaine baron the son of peasants had an estimated 1 
billion in drug profits stashed away at the time of his death frday 
in a gunfight with police 
rodriguez gacha 42 was one of the leaders of the medellin 
cartel which along with the cali cartel is responsible for 80 
percent of the cocaine smuggled into the united states 
rodriguez gacha had a grade school education and went from pig 
farming to bartending in the 1970s he became a hired killer for a 
colombian gangster trying to gain control of emerald mines 
he became feared throughout the tropical areas of central 
colombia killing emerald buyers and stealing their jewels 
he also became wealthy and surrounded himself with bodyguards 
and beautiful women 
about 10 years ago he became aware of the immense appetite for 
drugs in the united states and began using his emeraldwar profits 
to buy cocaine base from bolivia to be processed into pure cocaine 
by 1984 he had so much money he was giving some away 
when the southern city of popayan was devastated by a 1984 
earthquake rodriguez gacha was seen walking through the ruined 
city giving money to stunned survivors 
he and other major drug traffickers banded together to form the 
medellin cartel named after the northwestern city of medellin 
where smugglers traditionally had their headquarters 
rodriguez gacha had many ranches but perhaps his favorite was 
at pacho 50 miles north of bogota 
after the government declared war against the drug dealers in 
august when a presidential candidate was assassinated the army 
occupied the pacho ranch many peasants in the area told an 
associated press reporter at the time of the takeover that 
rodriguez gacha was generous 
they said he gave away thousands of dollars providing money for 
medical treatment and for seed and farm equipment when they could 
not get loans from the governments farm bank 
police acknowledged that rodriguez gachas popularity with 
peasants had made it difficult to trap him 
an american diplomat speaking with the condition of anonymity 
told journalists three months ago that rodriguez gacha and other 
traffickers had hundreds of people on their payrolls to help watch 
for police raids 
a vendor in a town square would be paid 50 a month to watch for 
security forces heading toward rodriguez gachas ranch the 
diplomat said and a police colonel might be paid 15000 a month 
for information 
but if rodriguez gacha was a saint to some colombians he was a 
monster to others 
authorities said he was behind the aug 18 murder of sen luis 
carlos galan one of the countrys leading presidential candidates 
who was shot down while addressing a campaign rally 
he has been linked to hundreds of murders of prosecutors judges 
and politicians 
rodriguez gacha also was responsibile for the killing in 1988 of 
jaime pardo leal leader of the leftwing patriotic union party 
authorities said more than 700 members of the patriotic union have 
been slain the past four years 
rodriguez gacha was accused of paying rightwing death squads to 
kill peasants suspected of supporting leftist guerrillas 
officials said rodriguez gacha was enraged by the guerrillas 
attempts to extort money from ranchers in areas where he owned 
property and vowed to exterminate them and any of their 
sympathizers

state environmental officials are questioning 
a decision to lay off workers cleaning up radioactive pollution at 
the governments fernald uranium plant after three supervisors 
received contaminated this week 
the accident happened as the supervisors were taking samples 
from concrete silos holding radioactive waste at the plant 18 
miles northwest of cincinnati the us department of energy which 
owns the plant said thursday the supervisors were exposed to 
radioactive radon gas 
some officials said the plants operators should have left such 
work to employees trained to handle the materials one hundred 
trained workers were laid off at the plant friday 
we dont want to interfere in the labor agreements between the 
company and the union but we need the information on the 
contamination and were concerned that the layoffs are affecting 
the speed at which we can do our work said graham mitchell 
fernald team leader for the ohio environmental protection agency 
the contamination occurred during the latest unsuccessful 
attempt to sample the contents of the silos the silos emit radon 
and are suspected of leaking waste into groundwater mitchell said 
cleanup plans are impossible until contents of the silos are 
analyzed 
westinghouse materials co of ohio the contractor operating the 
plant suspended production this summer to concentrate on cleaning 
up radioactive pollution 
ten union workers who had trained extensively for the sampling 
task were among those laid off said mel karnes an official of 
atomic trades amp labor council an umbrella group for the 14 unions 
at fernald 
so weve got three salaried individuals out there at 6 pm in 
the dark and cold trying to do it when theyve had no handson 
training karnes said 
the fernald plant had processed uranium since 1952 for use in 
nuclear reactors and weapons some of the wastes at the plant date 
from the manhattan project which produced the first atomic bomb 
during world war ii 
were very concerned that the trained cleanup people were laid 
off we think its inappropriate said catherine mccord a 
fernald expert with the epa in chicago 
department of energy teams from fernald and one from the 
departments oak ridge tenn laboratories on friday began 
investigating westinghouses 18hour delay in reporting the 
contamination incident 
theyre supposed to notify the emergency operations center in 
eight hours but in reality they should get to us sooner doe 
spokesman steve wyatt said it just didnt make very good sense

in an effort to placate the 
opposition government leaders today agreed to force former 
president chun doohwan to testify about corruption during his 
authoritarian rule 
the rare bipartisan agreement also barred two chun aides from 
politics indicated a release of political prisoners and included a 
proposal to restore honor and compensate victims of a 1980 
military crackdown of antigovernment protests 
the brutal suppression of the riots in the southern city of 
kwangju remain an open wound nearly a decade after it happened 
the results are not 100 percent satisfactory but i did my best 
to put an end to the dispute said opposition leader kim 
daejung who endorsed the compromise after seven hours of talks 
with president roh taewoo and two other opposition leaders 
no reason was given for the settlement which came as a surprise 
to south koreans who are generally unaccustomed to political 
compromise 
i am glad that i have been able to reach satisfactory 
agreement on the clearing away of the past issues roh told 
reporters after the talks 
roh also a former aide to chun had been dogged by the scandals 
from the previous administration and the united states had 
expressed concern over increasing political unrest 
roh is also under pressure because of a slowing of exports and 
the domestic market and newspapers today said he was expected to 
make major cabinet and party leadership changes 
under the agreement chun must go before national television to 
answer questions by lawmakers about corruption involving him his 
family and associates so far 47 people including a dozen members 
of chuns family have been convicted of corruption and power abuse 
the disgraced former leader surrendered 24 million in unused 
political funds before issuing a formal apology and going into 
rural seclusion last year 
the agreement bars two former army generals closely associated 
with him lee huisung and chung hoyong from politics and 
attempts to resolve a festering controversy about the riots in the 
southern city of kwangju 
chun chung and lee have been accused of using the 1980 uprising 
to seize power following the assassination of president park 
chunghee in 1979 
according to official count about 200 people were killed and 
more than 1500 were injured when the military crushed the 
antigovernment demonstrations 
officials said that under the agreement the government will 
accelerate actions to restore honor for citizens of kwangju 
who were labled as rebels by the chun administration 
they said a bill will be introduced in the national assembly to 
pay up to 500000 in compensation to families of each person 
killed in the crackdown 
the agreement also proposes the release of prisoners who are 
serving long terms for political crimes justice ministry officials 
said about 200 people are in prison after being convicted of spying 
for or helping communist north korea 
chun bowed to massive antigovernment demonstrations and agreed 
to step down following 1987 elections roh another chun associate 
was elected to succeed chun and took office in february 1988 
the opposition leaders said they would not raise other issues 
related to the chun adminsitration once all details set by the 
agreement have been implemented 
no deadline was officially set for implementation of the pact 
but presidential spokesman lee sujung said all problems should 
be settled before the end of this year 
government officials said the grand compromise was possible 
on the 11point agreement after roh accepted the key opposition 
demands for chuns public testimony and action against lee and 
chung 
chung is a legislator from rohs governing democratic justice 
party and lee is an executive of a staterun firm

the communist party fighting for its 
survival today said it fired party boss erich honecker to prevent 
civil war and to correct errors that had plunged the country into 
social and economic chaos 
the latest ringing denunciation of the old regime was read at 
the beginning of an emergency congress of the party which is 
considering radical moves in hopes it will retain some of its power 
in east germanys competitive elections in may 
the congress later released a letter by honecker in which he 
said he had deceived himself about the state of the economy and 
the mood of the people 
i take full responsibility for the situation that has 
arisen the ailing 77yearold former party chief told party 
officials in the letter written nearly a month ago he denied that 
he was guilty of corruption or misuse of office 
most of the 2750 delegates burst into applause as honecker now 
under house arrest was castigated for failing to heed mikhail s 
gorbachevs calls for reform he was blamed for committing errors 
that plunged the country into economic and social crises 
the party report said honecker had to be ousted oct 18 to 
prevent a civil warlike bloody conflict with those pressing 
for democratic change it also urged members to analyze past 
failings and criticized the party for failing to stand up to the 
corrupt party hierarchy 
it said however that the party should bear no collective 
guilt for the wrongs committed by the disgraced former leaders 
hundreds of thousands of east germans took to the streets and 
tens of thousands fled the country in revulsion of honeckers 
hardline rule in recent months despite democratic reforms that 
have included the opening of the berlin wall protests have 
continued as investigators have disclosed massive corruption and 
high living among the countrys former leaders 
the party has been stripped of its constitutional mandate to 
rule and more than 700000 members have quit in recent weeks 
dropping party membership to about 16 million 
also today the christian democrats one of the small political 
parties formerly aligned with the communists held its own congress 
and elected reformer lothar de maiziere to head its new drive for 
political autonomy 
 
the weekend emergency meeting follows two days in which two 
mainstays of communist rule the partys militia and the hated 
secret police were ordered dismantled by the government 
in discussing the report on the origins of the crisis delegate 
michael schumann said honeckers desire for selfpromotion 
outdistanced the political line he set for the party to follow 
exposing and punishing those who misused their offices have 
become major themes of communist reformers trying to win public 
trust and support at the polls 
in appeals for order and reason authorities have disclosed 
incidents of violence against secret police agents and communist 
party members and contended that unrest is mounting at an 
alarming rate 
but east berlin and other major cities visited in recent days by 
foreign journalists appeared calm and western diplomats with 
contacts nationwide suggest the official reports may be overstated 
under the new party platform the communists are seeking to 
redefine themselves as social democrats they may also vote today 
to change the name of the party to reflect its new direction 
in last weeks party congress gregor gysi a 41yearold 
lawyer was chosen the partys third leader in less than two months 
numerous grassroots reform movements have sprung up this fall 
and many of them intend to run candidates in the elections that 
will be the first to present the communists with any genuine 
competition in more than 40 years

throughout eastern mindanao the second largest philippine island 
and as far north as legaspi city 400 miles away said raymundo 
punongbayan director of the philippine institute of vulcanology 
and seismology 
punongbayan said the institutes observatory station in bislig 
570 miles southeast of manila reported cracks on the walls and 
slight damage to instruments he said a concrete wall of a nearby 
building collapsed crushing the 7yearold boy 
red cross and government officials had no other reports of 
damage or casualties in the remote area which has poor 
communication links with the capital manila 
in golden colo the us geological survey said the quake was 
centered in the pacific about 40 miles off northeast mindanao and 
160 miles from davao the city is 560 miles southeast of manila 
at least eight houses near the area also reported minor damages 
there were reports of widespread power outages in mindanao 
punongbayan added 
the governments philippine information agency said an abandoned 
onestory building in davao collapsed injuring a passerby 
we are fortunate that the earthquake struck a sparsely

damage if it had hit a city 
manila radio station dzxl said residents fearful of tidal 
waves fled their homes for higher ground when the tremor was felt 
lino abraham a researcher for the seismological institute 
office in bislig told dzxl that several aftershocks measuring 
about 3 on the richter scale were also felt he said the quake 
triggered landslides and the pacific swelled after the quake but 
there were no reports of tidal waves 
it was the biggest earthquake in that area since a quake 
registering 68 hit nov 7 1976 causing minor damage 
in august 1976 a quake measuring 79 struck near the 
southwestern coast of mindanao caused a tidal wave that killed 
about 8000 people a magnitude 71 earthquake in western mindanao 
the next day caused some injuries and damage 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake 
and each increase of one number means the ground motion is 10 times 
greater 
a quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in a populated 
area while one of magnitude 7 is capable of causing widespread 
heavy damage 
the quake that struck the san francisco area in october was 71

vietnam opposes the forced repatriation 
of boat people who sought refuge in hong kong and reserves the 
right to send them back to the british colony according to an 
official news report 
the vietnam news agency said on friday that a foreign ministry 
official delivered a note on vietnams position regarding the boat 
people to emrys davies britains ambassador in hanoi 
a foreign office spokesman in london said today taht britain 
would not comment because it had not received confirmation of what 
the note said 
a group of 51 vietnamese was flown from hong kong to hanoi on 
tuesday in the first forced repatriation of boat people 
vietnamese authorities accepted the group and said the refugees 
would not be mistreated but officials also criticized the forced 
repatriation program 
according to the vietnam news agency the foreign ministry note 
strongly rejected forced repatriation and said vietnam would only 
accept those who volunteer to return or who are not opposed to 
the repatriation 
it said the ministry official cautioned davies that any 
violation of these principles may hamper and even completely 
disrupt the process of cooperation to resolve this problem step by 
step as agreed to at a conference on indochinese refugees held in 
geneva in june 
according to the news agency the ministry official said that 
if vietnam discovers any case of forced repatriation it 
reserves the right to return them to hong kong 
many of the 44000 vietnamese who have sailed into hong kong 
since june 1988 are considered illegal economic migrants unless 
they can prove they fled their communist homeland to escape 
persecution thousands have demonstrated to protest the decision by 
britain and its colony to force the return of the refugees a 
decision condemned by the united states

ms mangano went into the coma after she suffered a heart attack 
during surgery for cancer said the luz clinic spokeswoman on 
condition of anonymity the actress had been suffering from cancer 
for several years 
film director pier paolo pasolini once called her a bitter 
beauty who shined like a pearl but was always distant in 
later years her career was overshadowed by that of her husband of 
34 years movie producer dino de laurentiis 
she was born in rome on april 21 1930 the daughter of a 
sicilian railroad worker and an english mother 
the trained dancer model and former miss rome played only bit 
parts until she landed the starring role in director giuseppe de 
santis 1949 film bitter rice considered one of best examples 
of the postwar italian neorealism movement 
filmgoers worldwide turned out to see the voluptuous actress 
cavorting in the fields of the po valley wearing a tight sweater 
shorts and thighhigh black stockings 
she then starred in movies for such directors as vittorio de 
sica pasolini mario monicelli and luchino visconti 
although ms manganos fame was overshadowed by two other 
haunting beauties of the italian screen sophia loren and gina 
lollobrigida she beat out the latter in auditions for bitter 
rice 
while she achieved stardom ms mangano never seemed comfortable 
in the role or even in making movies 
i agreed to appear in bitter rice more because i needed 
money than out of the desire to have a film career she once told 
an interviewer 
the actress once said i never liked myself neither when i 
was a roundish girl nor when i became a slender woman 
after a long absence from the screen she had a small role in 
the 1984 film dune and appeared in the 1986 film dark eyes

were in love i was 16 and he was 22 
as to her infrequent movie roles she explained at the time 
the truth is that making films is not my passion and i thought 
it was better for me not to work 
she separated from de laurentiis in 1983 and filed for divorce 
last year the couple had three daughters and a son who died in an 
air crash in alaska in 1981 
she spent the last few years living in in madrid with francesca 
her youngest daughter who is married to a spanish film producer

the communist party newspaper 
today confirmed that eight former leaders had either resigned or 
been removed from the partys policysetting central committee

several members of the central committee resigned 
the party daily rude pravo identified them today as former

hora said the politburo accepted all of the resignations on 
wednesday 
as part of the democratic reforms sweeping eastern europe 
czechoslavakias first government dominated by noncommunists in 41 
years took over sunday

a new democratic party some communists have been pressing the 
party to adopt reforms to be able to compete with the opposition

police who tracked down and killed a 
powerful leader of the medellin drug cartel called the slaying a 
splendid christmas present but warned that drug terrorism 
could rise as a result 
hours after gonzalo rodriguez gacha his 17yearold son fredy 
and five bodyguards were killed in a hail of gunfire friday 
authorities pledged to hunt down pablo escobar colombias cocaine 
godfather and its mostwanted criminal 
president bush called president virgilio barco to congratulate 
him and the countrys security forces for eliminating rodriguez 
gacha who has been implicated in hundreds of murders of 
politicians judges and peasants 
colombias medellin and cali drug cartels are believed 
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine that reaches the streets 
of the united states 
the operation was by far the biggest success of barcos 
16weekold war on drug traffickers authorities said gacha 
rodriguez in fact had ordered the aug 18 assassination of a 
leading presidential candidate the slaying that led to the 
governments crackdown on traffickers 
a bogota daily la prensa today quoted a journalist who was 
present at the raid as saying rodriguez gacha killed himself with a 
hand grenade after he was cornered by police 
the journalist was identified as silvio cohen a correspondent 
for barranquillas el heraldo newspaper la prensa said rodriguez 
gachas body was ripped to pieces by the grenade explosion 
however an official coroners report released today said bullet 
wounds to the head and body had killed rodriguez gacha apparently 
confirming the official version of his death 
just hours after the drug lords death gunmen fatally shot a 
police lieutenant in medellin the rcn radio network reported rcn 
said it was not known if the slaying was related to the drug war 
security forces tracked rodriguez gacha to a farm owned by 
escobar near the caribbean port of covenas 360 miles north of 
bogota rodriguez gacha and the others were wiped out in the fierce 
battle that ensued gen miguel gomez padilla the national police 
chief told a news conference in bogota 
the new york times reported in todays editions that police laid 
a trap for rodriguez gacha about 10 days ago the newspaper 
quoting senior police officials said gachas son who had been 
arrested earlier on a weapons charge was freed so police could 
follow him to rodriguez gacha 
about 1000 police and troops supported by seven helicopter 
gunships participated in the operation colombias leading 
newspaper el tiempo reported today citing police officials as its 
sources security forces began mobilizing for the raid late 
thursday el tiempo said 
a judge had released the traffickers son from jail on nov 23 
after holding him for three months police arrested the youth on 
aug 25 after raiding his hideout and discovering a weapons cache 
el tiempo quoted a police official as saying that authorities 
acted on information provided by farmers in the area gen carlos 
arturo casadiegos reportedly said the government would pay a 
581000 reward to the farmers 
none of the various versions of the events could be confirmed 
with bogota police today 
miguel maza marquez head of colombias investgative police 
said the traffickers death was a splendid christmas present 
rodriguez gacha was linked to many of the killings that have 
rocked colombia and killed 199 people since aug 18 
maza accused rodriguez gacha of ordering the killing of 
presidential candidate sen luis carlos galan a staunch opponent 
of the nations drug trade and the favorite to succeed barco

that killed 63 people outside the investigative police 
headquarters his cartel also was suspected in the nov 27 bombing 
of a avianca airlines jetliner near bogota which killed 107 people 
among the possible results of rodriguez gachas death is an 
increase in violence within the cartel itself to fill the power 
vacumn 
maza said the next step was to hunt down escobar we just need 
a little luck like we had today with rodriguez gacha maza said 
a former pig farmer who became a billionaire cocaine trafficker 
rodriguez gacha owned vast stretches of land in colombia 
he was fighting wars against the government as well as a rival 
cocaine cartel from the southern city of cali he was also battling 
other gangsters for control of the countrys emerald mines 
this guy wants to be the hitler of colombia a foreign 
diplomat said recently 
rodriguez gacha also financed and directed several rightwing 
death squads in recent years the death squads have killed 
hundreds of peasants suspected of supporting leftwing guerrillas 
officials have assumed that the drug lords are using a bombing 
campaign to try to pressure the government into abandoning its 
extradition policy decreed by the president as part of the latest 
crackdown 
the government has sent 10 middlelevel drug suspects to the 
united states in less than four months

while europe tries to come to grips with the 
idea of german reunification the two states are broadening ties so 
swiftly that reunification already seems under way 
washington and moscow insist they have a say in the process but 
neither bonn nor east berlin is paying much attention to the 
superpowers in the daily rush of changes 
not a day has passed in recent weeks without a visit or another 
series of agreements although east german communists loudly insist 
the contacts will stop short of a formal union 
the cooperation ranges from large industrial projects to plans 
for single subway tickets for west berlin and east berlin and 
completion of autobahn links broken off by world war ii 
for many countries though the memories of war and holocaust 
are still too fresh to make the prospect of a united germany a 
pleasing one 
the country would have 80 million people in the heart of europe 
and an economic might that would dwarf its neighbors fears about 
an emerging fourth reich have been voiced 
our neighbors are worried and their fears are justified 
says noted west german political scientist joachim perels 
josef janning an expert on eastwest relations at the 
university of mainz says fears of what reunification would bring 
are exaggerated but agrees west germany must consult with other 
countries on its policy toward east germany 
until recently politicians made perfunctory statements about 
unity but no one really took it seriously until a few months ago 
he told the associated press 
but now that the germans are discovering their own national 
policy there are justifications for fears bonn should not make 
any unilateral moves without consultations he said 
but some sort of german unity cannot be prevented not even 
the germans can prevent it 
chancellor helmut kohl angered some governments by proposing a 
10point plan for eventual reunification without consulting bonns 
allies 
european leaders have passed resolutions that hardly hide their 
fears of a mighty german state dominating europe us officials 
have said american and soviet interests and rights must be 
considered and secretary of state james a baker iii has urged a 
goslow approach to german reunification 
the soviets who have nearly 400000 soldiers in east germany 
have issued stern warnings against western intereference in east 
german developments and have clearly stated they are against 
reunification 
the leaders of the 12 european economic community countries have 
agreed that reunification must come through selfdetermination of 
the people in the two germanys and in consultation with other

american foundations are launching a series of 
initiatives to encourage the political social and economic changes 
sweeping through the soviet union and eastern europe 
efforts by foundations and private philanthropists range from 
assisting pig farmers in poland to fighting the spread of aids in 
the soviet union and arranging exchanges between us vietnam 
veterans and soviet veterans of the afghanistan war 
the recent initiatives were capped by last weeks announcement 
by the ford foundation that it was committing an additional 6 
million for grants to individuals and organizations in the region 
focusing on legal and political reforms economics and the 
environment 
franklin a thomas president of the major new yorkbased 
foundation said the changes offer it many important 
opportunities to contribute to the development of democratic values 
and pluralism in the region and to the integration of the soviet 
union and east european countries into the international system 
also last week the carnegie corporation of new york hosted a 
twoday conference of us foundation officials business 
executives government officials and academics to help map further 
philanthropic initiatives 
at least two american foundations dealing with the soviet union 
are pursuing programs with moscowbased affiliates that have gained 
official status under soviet law as independent philanthropic 
organizations 
one of them the san franciscobased foundation for social 
innovations usa was formed last june to work together with a 
foundation started two years earlier in the soviet union with 
sponsorship by the moscow newspaper komsomolskaya pravda a 
different publication from the oftenquoted pravda 
the groups have launched programs including an exchange of 
veterans of the afghanistan and vietnam wars as well as a project 
operated jointly with the esalen institute to help veterans and 
disaster victims cope with posttraumatic stress problems 
henry s dakin a san francisco philanthropist who has been a 
major contributor to the ussoviet effort said the foundation 
for social innovations also has organized an alaskasiberia project 
to help revive travel and peopletopeople contacts over that 
frontier 
the new yorkbased soros foundationsoviet union was founded in 
1987 by george soros a hungarian emigre who became wealthy as a 
money manager on wall street it has supported the launching of a 
soviet counterpart the cultural initiative with headquarters at a 
restored 17thcentury mansion in central moscow 
programs being undertaken by the sorosfunded organizations 
include bringing young soviet attorneys to this country for 
internships at american law firms assisting a 
wheelchairmanufacturing project in leningrad and providing 
americanmade disposable hypodermic needles to soviet hospitals 
this was a response to a growing sense of urgency in the 
soviet union about aids and ways of controlling it said anthony 
richter a soros foundation program officer 
concern about acquired immune deficiency syndrome has been 
heightened in the soviet union by recent incidents in which 
children in soviet hospitals were infected through the reuse of 
unsterilized needles 
in addition richter said the soros foundation has launched a 
very promising program to train soviet medical professionals in 
the use of americandeveloped methods for treating alcoholics 
soros also founded in 1984 a foundation dealing with his native 
hungary where that organization has begun projects to help 
independent organizations and small businesses get started and has 
broadened its program supporting englishlanguage instruction 
other american foundations currently funding programs in eastern 
europe include the rockefeller brothers fund the german marshall 
fund of the united states and the john d and catherine t 
macarthur foundation 
in poland the rockefeller brothers fund which has spent about 
4 million on eastern europe since 1983 assisted in the formation 
of a new warsawbased foundation for the development of polish 
agriculture 
john edie general counsel of the council on foundations a 
washingtonbased organization of 1200 grantmaking institutions 
said the polish group has really been a stimulation to the hog 
farmers they chose that because polish ham is a very popular 
export 
edie said american foundations were most interested in 
encouraging wider development of an independent sector in the 
soviet union and eastern europe because the more independent 
thinking and initiative there is in those countries the easier it 
is going to be for them to continue the direction theyre going 
toward

a team of experts from the united states 
britain and south korea joined saturday in urging a drive to reduce 
the numbers of europes 18 million unemployed 
europes longterm unemployed represent its greatest untapped 
resorde they said 
the group consists of economists olivier blanchard rudiger 
dornbusch and paul krugman of the massachusetts institute of 
technology mervyn king and richard layard of the london school of 
economics lawrence h summers of harvard university and yung chul 
park of korea university in seoul 
their report world imbalances was sponsored by world 
institute for development economics research set up in helsinki 
finland as part of the united nations university 
they suggested use of a swedish model to fight unemployment 
intensive placement conseling and retraining services for people 
who lose their jobs unemployment benefits that run out in 14 
months six months of public employment if no job has been found 
and a 50 percent wage subsidy lasting six months for employers who 
hire people who have been out of work for six months 
unemployment in sweden has never been over 35 percent and now 
stands under 15 percent the authors said 
for the united states they recommended an emphasis on increased 
savings low us savings and the accompanying high federal budget 
deficit create a worldwide shortage of capital threaten the world 
trading system and are a likely source of instability in the world 
economy they said 
in addition to reducing the federal budget deficit they 
suggested 
removing social security and its surpluses from the federal 
budget so that the apparent budget deficit is greater and public 
pressure increases to lower it 
restoring the individual retirement account and 
instituting tax incentives for savings such as a deduction 
for employees who as part of their wages will accept stock that 
cannot be sold for five years or a deduction for investment in 
special treasury notes that could not hesold 
they have a radical proposal for third world debt now close to 
13 trillion they would allow interest payments to be made in the 
currency of the debtor countries rather than in hard currencies 
like dollars or yen which are now required 
they said the effect would be to 
stop transfers of funds from debtor countries to creditors 
now running over 50 billion a year 
reduce the uncertainty of exchange rates thus encouraging the 
return of billions of dollars sent abroad for safekeeping by people 
in debtor countries and 
free the foreign currency held by debtor countries for 
purchases of goods in the creditor countries 
in the pacific they warned that a cut in the us budget could 
bring recession to east asia they recommended coordinating the 
policies of the united states and east asian countries on how 
production should be distributed among them 
to prevent the world trading system from breaking into regional 
blocs centered on the united states japan and the european 
economic community they urged 
quick reduction of the us trade deficit and reduction of 
surpluses in japan west germany and the industrializing countries 
of east asia 
easing of what they called the intransigence of the europeans 
on trade in farm products and 
further increases in imports into japan

president bush and french president 
francois mitjrrand today began a caribbean session expected to 
focus on fastpaced changes in eastwest relations 
bush and mitterrand both arrived separately at princess juliana 
airport on the dutch side of this small island and then flew 
separately by helicopter to the french section of the island to 
begin their talks 
presidental press secretary marlin fitzwater told reporters 
aboard air force one that the president was suffering mild 
laryngitis and a cold that he said the president was treating 
with aspirin a decongestant and throat lozenges 
asked why the president had travelled such a long way for so 
short a meeting with the french leader fitzwater told reporters 
both of them felt that they neeeded a facetoface meeting to 
discuss some of the more personal and private sides of the changes 
going on in eastern europe and their personal impressions of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and what is happening in 
the soviet union 
fitzwater added that president mitterrand asked for the 
meeting and president bush likes to meet with leaders in a 
facetoface situation it just made sense 
bush was to spend just over four hours on st martin before 
returning to washington in the evening 
us officials said mitterrand requested the meeting partly to 
discuss developments in eastern europe and also to reciprocate for 
the weekend he spent last spring at bushs oceanside retreat in 
maine 
bush had laryngitis friday night and canceled a trip to 
manhattan where he was to speak at the 80th convention of the 
naacp 
in a brief telephone call to the gathering friday night bush 
apologized for not being there and said i will use my office to 
speak out against racism and bigotry wherever it is found 
todays meeting at a secluded beach resort comes two weeks after 
bushs stormshortened summit with gorbachev off the mediterranean 
island of malta bush and mitterrand can expect better weather on 
st martin clear skies and temperatures in the 80s 
a discussion of gorbachev is expected to be high on the agenda 
mitterrand met with the soviet leader in kiev three days after the 
bushgorbachev summit 
undoubtedly theyll have some mutual reflections on those 
meetings fitzwater said 
mitterrand has also indicated he wants to brief bush on last 
weekends meeting of leaders of the 12nation european community in 
strasbourg france 
out of that will flow the larger issues of the changes going 
on in eastern europe the future of the nato alliance probably 
german reunification and all of those questions related to reforms 
in the soviet union fitzwater said 
european leaders at the meeting on the frenchgerman border 
endorsed the idea of a single germany but suggested a series of 
conditions to ensure that german reunification does not cause 
instability in europe 
mitterrand has stressed the need to take soviet concerns into 
account when discussing german reunification 
bush has voiced general support for ending the divisions in 
germany spawned by world war ii but says the united states should 
not press for a certain timetable and the eventual decision must be 
acceptable to both east and west germans 
the strasbourg session also produced statements by european 
leaders hailing recent changes in eastern europe and praising 
gorbachevs initiatives 
st martin is a 37squaremile island in the eastern caribbean 
shared by france and the netherlands 
bush and mitterrand were to meet for about three hours and have 
lunch at the resort then hold a joint news conference 
one administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said international terrorism also was expected to be discussed 
french authorities are under a heightened state of alert for 
what french interior minister pierre joxe has descried as an acute 
threat of terrorist attack during the holiday season 
on friday the state department expressed concern about the 
possibility that middle eastern terrorists may be planning a 
variety of attacks perhaps against us targets in western europe 
or west africa 
meanwhile the administration suggested friday that continued 
soviet adherence to a centralized planning course could 
jeopardize some economic incentives bush offered gorbachev 
fitzwater the presidential spokesman cited recent criticism in 
the soviet congress of peoples deputies of gorbachevs perestroika 
or restructuring and moves toward keeping multiyear planning 
methods

vice president dan quayle is predicting that 
within six months to a year events in china will vindicate 
president bush for his muchcriticized overtures to beijing 
in due time critics will see this as the right decision at 
the right time quayle said friday when asked about the 
widespread criticism of bush for sending two toplevel envoys to 
beijing last weekend 
in so doing the president opened the door to renewal of ties 
with china little more than six months after the chinese government 
used tanks to quell prodemocracy demonstrations killing hundreds 
possibly thousands of people 
the vice president would not give details but hinted that us 
officials in the wake of the weekend visit know of some forthcoming 
developments that will show an improved chinese posture on human 
rights and political freedoms 
china took a step backwards with the tiananmen square 
tragedy quayle said in the interview china hopefully will 
have the political reforms reinstituted and china will move 
forward my prediction is that the presidents bold initiative 
toward china will be fully appreciated within the long run by the 
american people 
bush quietly dispatched national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to 
beijing a week ago friday in a departure from the ban on 
highlevel contacts with china that he imposed after the tiananmen 
square massacre 
the visit was intended to begin discussions on normalizing 
relations but us officials have said that will not happen and 
the sanctions against china will not be lifted until china shows 
improvement in political reform and human rights 
quayle insisted that bush a former envoy to china knows what 
he is doing and had made a strategic and tactical decision 
as to what indications china has given that it might be open to 
us pressures for change he said watch what happens 
it takes time he said in the long run looking at the 
big picture looking forward having an idea of what the world is 
going to look like six months and a year from now the president 
will be fully vindicated in his decision i am hopeful that you 
will see progress in china 
as to why the administration is willing to deal with a country 
that has gone in the opposite direction while reforms sweep other 
communist nations quayle said china is probably ahead of the 
soviet union in economic reforms but he acknowledged as far as 
the political context the advancement of human rights of allowing 
peaceful dissent sensitivity toward civil rites china has got to 
move forward 
quayle was asked why the attitude is different toward china from 
what it is toward cuba and nicaragua two small countries that come 
under frequent and harsh attack by bush for being out of step with 
democratic movement in this hemisphere 
quayle said china is important as the worlds most populous 
country with nuclear capability and a common border with the 
soviet union 
the president is interested in advancing human rights in china 
and he knows full well that to advance human rights and make 
progress you have to be engaged rather than sitting on the side 
lines 
quayle also said that in looking at the coming year the 
administrations toughest foreign policy challenge will be the 
debate over central america particularly nicaragua 
the administration remains skeptical he said that the ruling 
sandinistas will hold fair elections in february as promised the 
elections will be an important factor in bushs decision whether to 
resume aid to the contra rebels who have been trying to topple the 
sandinistas for the past eight years 
quayle noted bush supports the diplomatic approach endorsed by 
congress and the presidents of the five central american nations 
but also that you dont rule out any options including contra 
aid 
the elections will be very important how theyre conducted 
if theyre held what nicaraguan president daniel ortega does 
during the election process on election day and thereafter he 
said 
domestically quayle said the administrations toughest 
challenge next year will be keeping the economy moving forward

for 11 years walter singer has been 
playing santa but he doesnt fill the red suit out as well as he 
used to hes lost 18 pounds since testing positive for the aids 
virus 
its not just gays or people sharing needles who get this 
disease said singer whose yearround civic generosity has 
earned him the title unofficial mayor for life 
anyone can get it even santa 
singer a retired businessman infected during a blood 
transfusion began taking the drug azt last may 
he has suffered fatigue and loss of appetite and dropped in 
weight from 183 pounds to 165 but he enjoyed riding on a float as 
santa in the towns festival of lights parade after thanksgiving 
and he plans to don the red suit and white whiskers again next year 
singer went public at a rotary club meeting last week hoping to 
call attention to the disease he is one of the subjects of a 
videotape about aids to be shown to 1 million rotary members 
singer a genuinely jolly man wont wallow in selfpity his 
style is to do something about a problem hes known his share of 
tragedy but says hes been pretty lucky too and wants to help 
when he can 
fifty years ago at 15 singer fled nazi germany with his mother 
and stepfather and settled in san francisco his father later died 
in a concentration camp 
he says he learned about the american way of life and 
voluntarism when he spent about a year and a half with a couple who 
took in refugees in the los altos hills 45 miles south of san 
francisco 
after high school he joined the army and spent most of world 
war ii taking care of german prisoners of war after the war he 
served 20 years in the reserves 
i felt i had an obligation to do something for my new 
country he said 
he and his wife marie had a son mark now 32 and a daughter 
who died 
singer worked as an art supply salesman then opened his own 
stationery store in 1976 and he stayed busy with the rotary and 
various civic groups to put something back in the town 
walters done virtually everything to help out this city 
said mayor dave reeder he and his wife are involved in 
everything he is one of those people who has always believed in 
and supported the community and is just a fine person 
the community honored him many times but singer wasnt into it 
for the awards he just liked to help he even came to resemble 
the image of st nick with his jiggling paunch 
in 1984 just before he turned 60 singer suffered a heart 
attack and underwent a fiveway bypass operation afterward he 
bled internally and had to have surgery again 
somewhere along the line i got six units of blood thats 
when the little bugaboo happened he said managing a chuckle at 
his bad luck 
it was early in the aids epidemic and screening for the virus 
in blood donors was not so sophisticated or as stringent as it 
would be later 
last march singer got a letter from the hospital saying he was 
one of 8000 patients who might have been exposed to the virus in 
may tests identified him as a carrier of the virus 
id read about aids in the paper he said but i thought 
this doesnt happen to walter its not a disease a person like me 
gets 
unknown to singer the president of his local rotary club 
lucien angius was dealing with his own aids tragedy his 
32yearold son in new york told him in january that he had an 
advanced case of the disease 
angius proposed an educational videotape about aids for 
rotarians in july but singer still didnt tell anyone about his 
own problem except his family 
singer retired in october on nov 25 angius son died last 
week singer decided to tell his story because he felt it would 
make fellow rotarians aware that they too could be stricken 
the response has been nothing but positive phone calls and 
cards so many people i knew some i didnt know called its been 
wonderful 
i think walter is a terribly courageous man to bring this out 
into the open and help the education process said reeder its 
a real sad thing but its opening up peoples eyes to the 
problem 
doctors have told singer he may have two to four more good years 
before the aids virus begins causing severe problems 
its not a pleasant way to go singer said but until 
then i plan a fairly normal way of life my wife and i want to 
travel see the us ill still do volunteer work i plan to keep 
busy 
ill be santa claus again next year and i hope for many 
years he said it gives me a lot of satisfaction to be able to 
entertain all the children

a select group from princetons silent 
generation busy accumulating privilege and power since the 
1950s has decided that wealth is not enough and is setting out to 
change society 
spurred by their least silent classmate ralph nader 120 
members of the class of 1955 at princeton university have set up a 
nonprofit organization to train future leaders shepherd 
undergraduates into public interest jobs and finance classmates who 
want to tackle societys ills 
they have already met with graduates in their mid50s from 11 
other colleges in the hope of triggering a national movement of 
civic involvement 
the 1950s era at princeton the expensive and exclusive grassy 
and gothic ivy league enclave in central new jersey gave rise to 
the tag the silent generation when a thin but highly 
publicized volume of essays revealed students more concerned with 
self than society 
we were known as the silent generation notwithstanding ralph 
naders work said stephen m boyd who heads princeton project 
55 after practicing law in paris and washington now he says 
the silent generation is finding its voice 
we did graduate in a time when no one questioned our 
institutions we were all pretty proud of them now after 35 
years our education system is failing the environment is in 
trouble families are disintegrating people are without houses 
the roots of the project were in consumer advocate naders 
objections to alumni traditions we were pampered flattered and 
stroked and asked to give money but never asked what we thought 
he said in an interview last week 
at a reunion last april nader suggested his class endow a 
center to get students involved in civic affairs through summer 
and yearlong internships in public jobs and networks to public 
interest work after graduation 
classmate charles w bray iii former ambassador and state 
department spokesman countered that naders idea was not ambitious 
enough that class members needed to involve themselves as well 
now incorporated the princeton project 55 plans to fund a 
nonpartisan center for civil leadership in princeton with an 
endowment between 5 million and 10 million 
fifteen proposed projects are being studied on issues such as 
affordable housing affordable energy and waste disposal the first 
might be launched next spring 
bray described a problem hed like to see tackled government 
spends 48 billion a year for the poor in cook county ill 
including chicago but 780000 residents remained below the poverty 
line in 1984 if the money were given directly to the poor most 
would rise above the poverty line but twothirds of that 48 
billion goes to us people who run organizations and live in the 
suburbs thats not working 
a lifelong advocate of change and organizer of the young and 
idealistic nader thinks hes found a catalyst for change where one 
would least expect it in the power structure 
historically change in this country has been driven by the 
young never by this generation nader said this group 
represents the power structure these people get their calls 
returned 
besides nader the project board includes two former us 
ambassadors a former atampt vice president a surgeon two 
professors two foundation executives a washington lawyer and two 
corporate presidents 
fiftyfive is the age when many corporations permit early 
retirement increasingly members of our generation are tired of 
their jobs and are taking that option boyd said but the golf 
and shuffleboard circuit is not of interest to us 
at a meeting this month they discussed their plans with 
representatives of the class of 1955 from alverno college the 
university of chicago fordham notre dame oberlin spellman 
stanford vassar the university of wisconsin washington 
university in st louis and yale 
after the meeting jack flynn began planning to survey notre 
dames class of 1955 to see if they would like to assist nearly 
2000 notre dame undergraduates who work on social concerns in 90 
cities 
catherine milton director of stanfords center for public 
service said she is checking to see if law medical and 
engineering graduates there are interested in copying a stanford 
business school program in which graduates provide management 
advice to nonprofit organizations 
nader said the princeton group wants to change whole systems 
that are failing this is not charity he said but as one who 
often has been on the wrong side of powerful interests he warns 
his classmates were not going to avoid collisions with power

enrollment of new students in college and 
university nursing programs rose for the first time in five years 
but this years increase is too little to overcome an acute nursing 
shortage according to a survey released sunday 
the american association of colleges of nursing said enrollment 
of firsttime nursing students in universities and fouryear 
colleges rose by 58 percent in the current 19891990 academic 
year about 60522 new nursing students are pursuing the 
baccalaureate degree both full and parttime this year compared 
with 57154 in the 19881989 academic year an advance copy of the 
survey showed 
combined baccalaureate enrollment including firsttime students 
and registered nurses returning for bachelor degrees is 89546 in 
the current academic year compared with 87700 a year ago an 
increase of 21 percent 
student enrollment may be in the early stages of an upturn 
said association director geraldine bednash but she added the 
road to reversing the nations acute nursing shortage remains a 
long one 
baccalaureate enrollment fell an alarming 319 percent from 
1984 to 1988 but ms bednash said enrollment increases this year 
reduced that fiveyear slide to 177 percent 
overall shortages in student enrollment and in the nursing 
work force will likely continue for several years ms bednash 
said 
in 1988 total graduations of firsttime nurses with 
baccalaureate degrees were 162 percent lower than the year before 
in 1989 graduations of firsttime students about 16003 were 
still 113 percent below 1988 figures 
officials said the survey is based on data received in fall 1989 
from 538 of the nations 623 nursing schools with fouryear 
bachelors degree and graduate degree programs the association 
with more than 400 member institutions nationwide said the report 
represents 124927 fulltime and parttime students in both member 
and nonmember institutions in 50 states the district of columbia 
and us territories 
this is the second consecutive year in which enrollment 
figures have shown some improvement said ms bednash she 
explained that nursing schools in the 198889 academic year had 79 
percent fewer baccalaureate students enrolled than the year before 
but the decline was greatly less than the 145 percent drop seen 
from 198687 
most registered nurses pursue continued education parttime but 
the survey indicated a dramatic 447 percent increase in rns 
those with hospital diplomas or twoyear associate degrees who 
returned to school fulltime during the last five years to earn the 
baccalaureate degree in 1985 there were 4151 rns who returned 
compared with 6010 in 1989 
the data reflect the growing numbers of nurses who are 
furthering their education fulltime to keep pace with the 
increasing complexities and treatment and technological advances in 
todays health care system said the survey 
ms bednash said the signs of change are promising including 
expanded interest in nursing as a rewarding and secure career as 
seen in increased student applications to schools of nursing 
for the current academic year qualified applicants totaled 
16962 compared with 14813 in 198889 an increase of 145 
percent the numbers of students accepted by schools of nursing 
this year at 14717 increased by 144 percent over last years 
total of 12861

three weeks ago while prague 
spring hero alexander dubcek stood triumphantly on a balcony over 
a sea of prodemocracy demonstrators on wenceslas square jiri ruml 
sat alone in a cell 
since then the editor of the underground lidove noviny 
peoples newspaper has been released and his life has been 
transformed from that of a dissident journalist jailed for 
defending civil liberties to head of a flourishing legal biweekly 
donations have been pouring in from all over the world to help 
the newspaper get on its feet including a 10000 grant from the 
parisbased fund for censorship which groups six western press 
associations 
the newspaper is founding a publishing house that will print 
magazines and books including an anthology of articles from lidove 
noviny in its samizdat days 
since his release ruml has worked nonstop editing the next 
edition of the newspaper giving endless rounds of interviews to 
foreign journalists and attending countless political meetings 
i dont eat i dont sleep i just prepare lidove noviny 
which at my age is not so easy said ruml 64 but finally we 
can do this and i will be leaving something good to the young 
people who take over 
banned by the communists the underground newspaper 
clandestinely printed only 450 copies that circulated among about 
10000 dissidents and supporters hungry for information rather 
than the propaganda published in the official press 
more than 500000 copies will be printed for distribution on 
wednesday the first since the prodemocracy revolution ended 
communist domination of the government 
among the first acts of the new oppositionapproved government 
sworn in a week ago was the firing of the official state censor 
now even the communist party dailies rude pravo and pravda 
carry news instead of pablum and propaganda each days pages 
offer reports on formerly taboo subjects like the secret police and 
corruption in the highest party circles 
only a month ago editors made weekly visits to the communist 
party press office to hear about the previous weeks errors and 
receive advice 
offensive passages were deleted offensive publications were 
confiscated before they hit the street and some journalists who 
operated too far from the party line like those editing samizdat 
journals wound up behind bars 
all that is changing 
it will be a challenge ruml said but i think we will be 
successful the best writers will want to work for us 
many of the best writers in czechoslovakia already have 
including playwright vaclav havel leader of the opposition civic 
forum and the most popular man in czechoslovakia his article 
goodbye samizdat will run on the front page ahead of rumls 
editorial everything is different 
three weeks ago ruml was in his 6footlong cell at ruzyni 
prison awaiting trial on charges of acting out of hostility 
toward the socialist state 
i was very isolated he recalled but on the night of the 
23rd i suddenly heard people shouting long live charter 77 an 
opposition group and then i heard another person shout that dubcek 
had given a speech on wenceslas square i knew something big had 
happened outside 
the next day he exchanged cigarettes for a newspaper and read 
about the enthusiastic welcome given dubcek leader of the prague 
spring reforms who was ousted and discredited after the 
sovietled invasion in 1968 
the newspaper also reported a groundbreaking meeting between 
then communist premier ladislav adamec and members of the 
prodemocracy opposition including rumls son 
so i thought to myself if he can sit with adamec why should 
i be sitting in this jail the next day i was out he said 
within hours he was addressing thousands of supporters outside 
the laterna magika theatre magic lantern headquarters for the 
civic forum 
his paper once shunned as the voice of hopeless dissidents 
became the noble voice of the new czechoslovakia 
we knew this would happen but it came sooner than expected 
still it was long long overdue

several thousand protesters saturday 
demanded an official funeral service for the victims of stalinist 
purges including a communist party chief who was hanged after a 
show trial 40 years ago 
the demand from members of the prodemocracy movement came 
during a rally in sofia commemorating the former party leader 
traicho kostov who was convicted of spying and stirring up 
hostility against the soviet union 
an unidentified speaker at the rally accused vasil kolarov who 
was premier at the time of conspiring to arrange kostovs 
execution on nov 16 1949 and of sending hundreds of people to 
stalinist camps in the soviet union 
others said kostov was killed because he resisted soviet orders 
on trade 
the crowd chanted we want the names of the killers 
expressing outrage over a stalinist terror campaign in bulgaria in 
the 1940s and early 1950s 
around the time of the kostov trial 1080 people including 
party and military officials were prosecuted the official news 
agency bta said friday no official publication has ever said how 
many poeple died in the purges 
the rally came amid swift political developments in bulgaria 
where hardline communist party leaders were ousted in the face of 
large prodemocracy demonstrations in one concession officials 
condemned the 1968 warsaw pact invasion of neighboring 
czechoslovakia saying history has proved it to be wrong and 
incompatible with the new course of the bulgarian communist party 
a resolution adopted at the rally saturday said a bust of kostov 
should replace a memorial to kolarov located behind the mausoleum 
of national hero georgi dimitrov in the center of sofia it also 
called for erecting a monument to all victims of the stalinist 
system in bulgaria 
the resolution demanded that a commission be formed to 
investigate and publish all crimes committed during the stalinist 
years in bulgaria 
kostov was bulgarias most prominent victim of show trials 
organized in eastern europe at the time at the request of soviet 
dictator josef stalin 
the aim of these purges was to liquidate those leaders who 
advocated a national road to socialism in their respective 
countries

babies are becoming luxuries with the cost of 
getting them through just the first year nearly double what it was 
a generation ago according to a business magazine 
in their first year of life babies cost 5774 in goods and 
services reports american demographics a magazine that analyzes 
consumer trends 
a department of agriculture study calculates the cost of a 
babys first year at between 5096 and 5602 but researcher mark 
lino says that analysis is being updated and the figures are 
expected to increase 
a life magazine report in 1958 calculated the cost of babys 
first year at just 800 worth of goods and services 
allowing for inflation that would be 2892 today 
and once parents opt for this luxury theres no turning back 
with the cost of raising a child through age 18 estimated at 
100000 reports blayne cutler a senior editor of american 
demographics 
nonetheless americans produced 39 million offspring last year 
according to the national center for health statistics that was a 
2 percent increase from the year before although short of the 42 
million births recorded in 1958 
in his comparison with the costs of 1958 cutler observes that 
parents today face expenses that wouldnt have occurred 30 years 
ago 
few families needed day care 30 years ago today more than 
half of firsttime mothers are back at work before their child 
celebrates a first birthday reported cutler day care costs 
todays parents an average of 53 a week 
car seats disposable diapers formula and sophisticated 
photographic equipment also add to the expense facing firsttime 
parents cutler wrote 
car seats are required by law infant formula is urged by 
physicians and disposable diapers are demanded by harried parents 
cutler said 
during the first year the average baby requires 3000 disposable 
diapers according to cutler these cost 570 
food and feeding equipment will cost parents 855 he estimated 
with a cost of 995 for furniture 352 for clothing 223 for 
bedding and bath supplies 396 for medicine and personalcare 
products and 199 for toys 
cutlers estimates for babys first year are close to but a bit 
higher than those calculated by the governments family economics 
research group 
that agency figures getting an urban baby through its first year 
would be least costly in the northeast at 5096 a baby would cost 
5138 in the midwest 5523 in the west and 5602 in the south 
those figures take a set of 1960 estimates and update them for 
inflation explained lino who is currently updating the figures 
we will be adding new items such as child care that is 
expected to be a big item he said in addition extra costs will 
be added in for such things as disposable diapers car seats 
higher transportation costs and other items he said 
over 18 years the west is the most expensive place to raise a 
child the department of agriculture figures 
while cutler used a national average of 100000 for 18 years 
lino calculated the cost of 18 years of parenting at 116995 for 
residents of the west 114483 in the south 110891 in the 
northeast and 105055 in the midwest

a university wants to recruit minority high 
school graduates with a special interest in volleyball even though 
their math and science grades may be just average 
a soontograduate high school senior wants to stay near home 
and pursue a career in nursing but doesnt know where to find 
information on the best vocational education courses 
richard frazier founder and chairman of collegiate research 
services inc likes to think he can help both with his new 
computer service acces the american career and college entry 
service 
sophomores and juniors at participating high schools complete 
free of charge a 45minute 23page survey that details their 
future education and career interests and preferences frazier said 
in a recent interview that the survey goes beyond standardized test 
scores grade point average and geographical location 
colleges universities and trade schools use the student 
profiles to try to determine who will likely succeed at their 
institutions 
nearly 14000 high schools had registered to participate by the 
end of november and the goal is to have 17000 high schools 
throughout the united states and american overseas schools around 
the world by january said frazier who wants to have about 4 
million students profiled in the oneline computer network 
by next fall information will be available to postsecondary 
institutions that pay fees ranging from 2000 to 6000 a year 
the goal is to have 4000 subscribers by late next year said 
frazier 
acces is for the entire student population he said there 
are very few programs offered that have benefits for every single 
student across the entire class thats what makes it unique 
frazier recalls his own unpleasant experience contemplating life 
after high school 
his admission application was rejected by brown university i 
was a very good student but scored poorly on college entrance 
exams he said 
i think gee if someone had taken the time to say here is a 
kid with good grades still working and attending a competitive 
high school perhaps i would have stood more of a chance said 
frazier who eventually enrolled in norwich university a military 
college in vermont before transferring to catholic university 
with acces he said were hoping to accomplish two things 
get these students involved early on in their high school years 
get them thinking and planning their journey beyond high school 
recruiters can find those students who usually are missed or 
overlooked because they have no plans to take college entrance 
tests or have bleak chances of graduating they said 
were giving these institutions a way to identify students 
they never had before and were giving them information in a 
manageable format said grogan 
acces was designed over a period of four years evolving from a 
service focusing on students with special needs assisting in the 
project was a national advisory council of educators business 
leaders and policymakers from such organizations as the national 
council of educational opportunity associations the committee for 
economic development and the national association of secondary 
school principals 
david dunaway of the secondary school principals group said that 
although the program is very intriguing the organization has 
declined to endorse the service until further review 
acces has the potential to be an outstanding product added 
dunaway principal of benjamin russell high school in alexander 
city ala he said his school has not subscribed because of 
concerns over the security of the information given by the students 
and the time needed for the students to complete the survey 
as for security frazier said only postsecondary institutions 
accredited by bodies recognized by the department of education or 
the council on postsecondary accreditation are eligible to 
subscribe to the network state employment and training agencies 
also can join so students can learn about job training 
opportunities or internships he said

can a bad review kill a good show 
a growing number of broadway producers writers and theater 
people say the answer is yes if its in the new york times 
the longsimmering debate boiled over recently when british 
playwright david hares latest drama the secret rapture 
closed shortly after times drama critic frank rich soundly panned 
it as coarse agitprop and so pallid an imitation of life 
rich was not the only critic to voice unfavorable opinion the 
daily news called the play too calculated too schematic new 
york newsday called it flawed but fascinating 
but as bernard gersten executive producer of lincoln center 
theater put it rich uses hydrogen bombs where ordinary 
oldfashioned artillery would do 
hare best known for his 1978 play plenty fired off a 
letter to rich calling him irresponsible and gratuitously 
abusive rich responded with a letter acknowledging the 
consequences of my reviews but considering himself honorbound 
to express his opinion 
the feud landed on the front page of the trade newspaper 
variety excerpts from both letters were printed in such diverse 
publications as the wall street journal and the village voice 
hares sentiments are not uncommon in the theater world where 
shows are becoming more expensive both to produce and to see the 
complaints are usually expressed privately but some people are 
speaking out 
katharine hepburn gave the producers of a few good men a 
favorable quotation to use in their advertising after rich trashed 
the drama last month 
its difficult and discouraging for any play to be mounted now 
it costs so much and people dont always go she told 
columnist liz smith so i wanted to say that people have to make 
up their own minds they have to read more notices than just one 
critic 
the 40yearold rich who joined the times in 1980 has clout 
that is unrivaled among critics in any other major art form 
when reviews are mixed said press agent merle debuskey 
youll find the show either succeeds or fails on what the times 
critic has said 
rich described this seasons prince of central park as a 
numbing evening of guileless amateurism the play folded 
after four performances he called rock star sting a stiff and 
his show a revival of 3 penny opera an inert gray mass 
despite a 45 million advance it closes new years eve after only 
a twomonth run 
but a rave from rich can translate quickly into box office 
dollars 
city of angels a new musical without big stars was taking 
in about 18000 a day in advance ticket sales before it opened 
according to general manager ralph roseman the day after it opened 
to mixed reviews but lavish praise from rich the box office 
take was 324700 
although impossible to quantify many in the theater world 
believe rich also has closed a good number of shows 
in his letter hare said much of the problem is richs 
unwillingness to pull punches when he writes a bad review 
it is not your job to make my play run he wrote but nor 
is it your job to close it and you did close it not by what you 
wrote but by the manner in which you wrote it 
yet a bad rich notice is not always fatal lewis allen producer 
of a few good men said the box office is struggling but alive 
for his show a drama about military justice 
rich has had little affection for andrew lloyd webber but the 
british composers phantom of the opera is still the hottest 
ticket on broadway and cats has been running since 1982 
rich declined to be interviewed for this story in his letter to 
hare however he acknowledged the influence of the times adding 
its credibility is a trust that all its writers work hard to 
preserve 
hare called on the times to find a replacement for theater 
critic walter kerr who provided a second opinion with his separate 
reviews for the sunday paper before retiring in 1983 
warren hoge the times assistant managing editor who oversees 
cultural coverage said he is very close to hiring a second 
frontline critic 
frank himself would love to have some of the pressure 
removed hoge said 
clive barnes the times theater critic for 10 years before going 
to the new york post in 1977 said he had his own runins with 
producers when he was in richs shoes 
barnes believes many producers are just looking for a scapegoat 
if their plays bomb you have to remember that most of these 
shows that get terrible notices are terrible shows

gov rose moffords decision to commute the 
prison terms of two convicted murderers and her sudden aboutface 
has voters talkshow hosts and politicians questioning her 
competence and political savvy 
the 67yearold democrat was elevated to governor last year from 
her largely ceremonial elected post as secretary of state upon the 
impeachment conviction of republican evan mecham the questioning 
of whether she is a lightweight or a leader comes as mrs mofford 
begins gearing up for an election campaign next year 
the immediate furor centers on commutations mrs mofford signed 
several months ago that became public only recently 
carl kummerlowe 62 whose commutation was signed in may had 
been sentenced to life in prison for bludgeoning a servicestation 
manager to death in 1969 dismembering his body and packing it into 
ice chests for disposal 
james hamm whose commutation was signed in july had been 
sentenced to life in 1974 for killing two drug dealers near tucson 
to steal their profits 
the board of pardons and paroles had recommended the 
commutations saying both men had been model prisoners who had 
rehabilitated themselves and deserved commutations so they could 
become eligible for parole earlier 
mrs mofford said she knew both were murderers but says she 
wasnt given the boards full report about them board officials 
say detailed files on the men were supplied to her office and that 
mofford aides apparently summarized them for her 
one lawmaker peter goudinoff says he thinks the storm will 
blow over by election time next november 
the real issues are down the road budget taxes and to some 
degree auto insurance says goudinoff a democrat who teaches 
political science at the university of arizona when the legislature 
isnt meeting 
but other lawmakers say mrs mofford has wiped out any progress 
she had made before the controversy 
everybody feels sorry for her said republican leo corbet 
chairman of the senate judiciary committee shes a nice lady 
but shes about 12 leagues over her competency level 
mrs mofford declined to be interviewed for this story her 
inhouse political expert special assistant rip wilson said 
theres no question the governor can be staffed better 
when she first became chief executive lawmakers and voters 
found mrs moffords lowkey style a welcome relief from the 
constant controversy that swirled about mecham whose sharp tongue 
alienated many minorities and other groups 
but lawmakers criticized her after this years first legislative 
session as someone more interested in cutting ribbons than running 
government 
in october when state agencies sought more than 1 billion in 
spending hikes for next year despite a looming state financial 
crisis republicans said the inflated budget requests were proof 
that mrs mofford couldnt manage her agencies 
in november mrs mofford called lawmakers into special session 
on auto insurance but abandoned it when the going got unexpectedly 
rough 
just last week mrs mofford stunned state labor leaders who 
form a key constituency when she accepted an award from an 
antiunion group the latest in a series of slaps at organized 
labor 
the commutations controversy might have blown over quickly if 
mrs mofford had stuck to her guns lawmakers say after all 
former gov bruce babbitt commuted the sentences of 26 convicts and 
even the archconservative mecham reduced a murderers sentence 
but mrs mofford did an aboutface when criticism of the 
commutations arose announcing tuesday that she would take the 
whole thing back if attorney general bob corbin said she had the 
authority to do so 
corbin did her one better announcing friday that he had found a 
technical loophole to void the commutations retroactively before 
they even got to mrs moffords desk he found the victims 
families had not been properly notified of the pending commutations 
the governor also made contradictory statements that left voters 
puzzled 
at one point for example she said that no murderer should be 
allowed back on the streets minutes later she said that she had 
known that kummerlowe and hamm were murderers before she commuted 
their sentences

the navys top admiral says the soviet union 
may be able to achieve much of what it wants in naval arms control 
by just sitting back and waiting for budget pressures to pare 
away the us fleet 
it is not in the interest of this country to have a weak navy 
or even a weaker navy adm carlisle ah trost the chief of 
naval operations said in an interview last week in his pentagon 
office 
the admiral reviewing the results of the recent malta summit 
firmly rejected any move towards entering naval arms control 
discussions with the soviets a stance taken by president bush in 
his talks with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
in the interview trost also took a tough line on impending 
budget cuts contending it would be difficult to expect the service 
to take on additional duties such as the war against drugs with 
fewer ships and personnel 
if we are to have the capability to respond as we are 
called on repeatedly we need the force we have now as the absolute 
minimum he said 
if not the admiral warned youre meeting the same 
commitments with fewer forces your ability to respond goes 
down the burden on your personnel goes up 
defense secretary dick cheney has been ordered to keep pentagon 
spending to 292 billion for the next fiscal year a level 2 
percent below the anticipated inflation rate 
and in order to keep expenses in line with anticipated tight 
budgets in the coming years of 1992 to 1994 the secretary has also 
ordered the armed services to come up with plans to cut some 180 
billion in projected spending over the coming years 
the admiral declined to comment specifically on reports that the 
service plans to meet cheneys directive by cutting ship strength 
from 562 ships to 500 including two to three aircraft carriers 
and navy and marine corps manpower by 40000 
but he noted that the soviets are keenly aware that economic 
belttightening is in washingtons future 
they do understand the political process he said they 
can look to achieve much of what they want to achieve just by 
sitting back and waiting 
trost said the soviets continue to press for naval arms control 
because their goal is to constrain the capability of the us 
navy which they have repeatedly stated is one of their greatest 
concerns 
at malta the soviets reportedly spelled out new more stringent 
conditions for an accord on submarinelaunched cruise missiles 
indicating they want a deal on those weapons concluded in tandem 
with a strategic weapons treaty that is supposed to be ready for a 
summit in june 
trost rejected soviet assertions that anticheating measures 
could be worked out to check for the presence of nucleartipped 
cruise missiles on ships or submarines the admiral said there are 
too many ways to cheat or break out of the an agreement by 
hiding the small lethal weapons 
the ability to verify such things as sealaunched cruise 
missiles is nil he said theres no chance of coming up with 
a good comprehensive system that covers everything at all times 
and guarantees against breakout 
the united states has also rejected the idea of allowing soviets 
on board their ships and submarines as too intrusive a way to 
check for the presence of the weapons 
verification is a major problem he said it cant easily 
be wished away 
the admiral who delivered the same message directly to soviet 
naval officers during a sixday visit to the their country in 
october said president gorbachevs push for curbs is a recognition 
of the strength of the us force as well as economic pressure 
what youre seeing is a reflection of an honest concern of the 
capability the deterrent affect of a strong us navy and 
the realization that competition with us is expensive the 
admiral said 
to those who would say that the soviet threat is lessening 
trost argues i remind them that the political statement of 
threat has gone away but the military capability remains 
even if we see a total reduction of soviet naval capability 
our requirement for a navy remains because we have a lot of people 
around the world who arent always friendly to us interests 
the admiral expressed some skepticism when asked about reports 
that president bush and other top members of the us adminstration 
have received intelligence reports for months saying the soviets 
had ordered defense cutbacks but the officials continue to warn of 
a growing soviet threat 
if there is such a nice concrete blackandwhite intelligence 
result id like to see it trost shot back

an unprecedented 580000 fine imposed on 
a pillow factory accused of hiring more than 100 illegal aliens in 
a rural town reflects how shrinking job markets in border states 
have dispersed immigrants officials said 
the civil fine levied wednesday against piedmont quilting corp 
in walhalla is the largest imposed by the immigration and 
naturalization service under a 1986 law that penalizes employers 
caught hiring illegal aliens 
the ins also pursued a criminal case and last week the 
company its owners and nine managers were indicted on charges of 
illegally recruiting and harboring 117 illegal aliens 
in a july raid immigration officials said they found 85 illegal 
aliens from mexico and peru working at the plant including a 
12yearold boy earning 4 to 5 an hour doing menial labor all 
were deported subsequent investigation raised the number of 
illegal aliens alleged to have been hired at the plant to 117 
walhalla population 4000 is near sumter national forest 
about 15 miles from the georgia and north carolina borders in 
northwestern south carolina 
police chief john gillespie said he contacted the ins after 
several plant workers stopped for traffic violations and other 
minor offenses could not produce proper identification 
fred alexander deputy district director of the ins regional 
office in atlanta said the agency tends to focus enforcement 
efforts on urban areas where we feel they are likely to do the 
most good 
but while the walhalla raid was unusual it may be readily 
explained by economic trends beginning with depressed job markets 
in texas and louisiana 
people are traveling east for jobs and this particular group 
found them in walhalla alexander said 
the ins does not plan to concentrate on the southeasts textile 
industry in the wake of the piedmont quilting case alexander said 
i think it is by far and away the exception rather than the 
rule said frederick b dent jr president of the 80member 
south carolina textile manufacturers association 
dent who also is president of mayfair mills in arcadia said 
even though his company cannot find enough workers it would not 
resort to hiring illegal aliens 
we would rather have jobs go unfilled than to break the law 
and incur the penalties and the public disgrace the piedmont 
problem brought dent said 
you hear of those things in new york and texas and border 
states but its the first time ive heard of it here said james 
walsh presidentelect of the south carolina needle trades 
association and manager of lexington sportswear i think its an 
isolated incident 
however possible violators of the 1986 immigration law 
probably have more of a likelihood of not being discovered in 
the south because the ins main resources and personnel are in 
texas and california said donald a young officer in charge of 
the agencys office in charlotte nc 
in the indictment handed up tuesday in greenville piedmont 
quilting owner alfred mizhir 55 and his wife gail mizhir 30 
both of spring lake nj face possible prison terms of 653 years 
and fines totaling 51 million if convicted on all charges 
the nine other indicted company managers or officers also each 
face up to 653 years in prison if convicted 
the criminal charges resulted from a sixmonth investigation 
that included the use of an undercover ins agent who posed as a 
plant worker immigration officials said 
ins officials reported working conditions were unsafe for 
children who were confronted by large machinery and 150pound 
bales of fabric used to make pillows quilts and comforters 
the administrative fine also covers the companys failure to 
comply with procedures to verify that the plants more than 400 
employees were not illegal aliens ins officials said 
the company which has 30 days to contest the civil fine has 
refused to comment attorney bill bannister who represents 
piedmont quilting did not return calls to his office friday

richard coddington flips tractors over 
rolls them down hills and wrecks them but the accidents he causes 
are all on a computer screen its all part of a research project 
to make the most deadly workplace the farm a little safer 
coddington and bob aherin agricultural engineers at the 
university of illinois developed the computer simulation so they 
could observe factors that lead to accidents on the farm 
agriculture leads the national safety councils list of the most 
deadly occupations there were about 1500 farm deaths and 140000 
disabling injuries nationwide in 1988 according to the 
chicagobased organization which had no individual state figures 
tractor rollovers are the leading accidental cause of 
farmrelated deaths in illinois accounting for about 30 percent of 
them according to the country companies insurance group of 
bloomington 
the goal is to find out what contributes to an accident and 
what protective devices will help the farmer said coddington 
i would think manufacturers would find this useful in designing 
new equipment 
the computer allows the researchers to specify things like the 
weight wheelbase and center of gravity of the tractor plus the 
slope of the hill they take into consideration factors like wet 
slippery fields 
id like to know if it is going to roll how long it will take 
and the total energy unleashed during the rollover he said 
coddington punches in some data on his keyboard during a recent 
test and a tractor appears on the screen its right wheels slide 
off the edge of a hill its left wheels lift off the ground then 
bounce back down 
it tried but it didnt turn over he said it tipped then 
rocked back 
the information is changed and again the tractor tips 
now as it goes past the point of no return it will roll 
over said coddington 
what can make the difference between a tractor that rolls over 
and one that stays on its wheels a lower center of gravity and 
wider wheel spacing can be designed by engineers but they stress 
that the care exhibited by the person behind the wheel is always a 
factor too 
manufacturers try to make their equipment safe and post 
warnings about hazards said coddington but people are crazy 
theyll use equipment in no way shape or form the way it was 
intended 
the computer simulation not only may help manufacturers design 
safer equipment but could increase farmers awareness of dangerous 
conditions the researchers say

its after school on a brilliant wintry day 
but there are no children romping in the snow at the woodside 
apartments where 5yearold melissa lee brannen disappeared from a 
christmas party two weeks ago 
at the school bus stop where perhaps one mother might have 
stood with a dozen children last month now three or four mothers 
wait says resident sally marquis whose 2yearold son daniel 
played with melissa for hours at the apartment complex party from 
which the little girl vanished 
those who arent there you can see them lined up at the 
bottom of the stairs keeping an eye on their youngsters from a 
distance without embarrassing those who think theyre grown up 
enough to wait alone she said 
the middleclass neighborhood around the modern woodside complex 
is tense scared resident susan kunze said 
usually you see kids out all the time at all hours but 
lately its rare that you see a kid out alone without a parent or 
at least a friend she said 
the kunze children diane 9 and joseph 10 know their 
quiet shy little friend melissa has disappeared they also had 
been taught at school and at home long before melissa vanished to 
be wary of strangers and to scream and run if someone tried to grab 
them id scream and kick him in the shins declared joseph 
but when a reporter theyd never met knocked on their apartment 
door the two flung it open with a cheerful hi they left it 
wide open as they raced to get their mother 
being wary of strangers is a lesson that takes time to seep in 
when 10yearold rosie gordon another fairfax county resident 
was abducted and killed last july everyone was shocked that it 
could happen says tammy brannen melissas 27yearold mother 
but people at the woodside apartments adjacent to the towering 
trees of fort belvoir didnt take any special precautions i 
dont think we ever associated it with happening to us she said 
ms brannen who was divorced 2 years ago and moved to her 
apartment in august 1987 seems numb 
it still doesnt really seem real she whispered during an 
interview last week at times it seems like shes over at my 
parents or at school and shes going to walk in the door at any 
minute 
fairfax county police officer michael proffitt said we like 
to think that since it doesnt happen that often that were 
somewhat immune from it but then were shocked back to reality 
that no one is immune from something like this 
the whole region is alert he says reflected by the hundreds of 
phone calls from concerned citizens unfortunately very few 
represent solid leads 
proffitt said melissas case has generated far more rumors than 
any other case in the county 
one false rumor broadcast by some radio and television stations 
was that melissas body had been found in a trash bin 
ms brannen was angered by that report and by reports that an 
apartment complex maintenance man had failed liedetector tests and 
had refused to help police although his wife said he was home late 
dec 3 immediately washed his clothes and cut out parts of his 
shoes with a knife later reports said the fbi and police had 
searched the mans home and emerged with boxes of possible evidence 
and were checking blood stains found in his vehicle 
if people hear that theyll quit looking for her ms 
brannen said 
police and hundreds of volunteers have conducted numerous 
searches of the area but they have curtailed those until they get 
new leads proffitt said 
despite the areas middleclass residential nature about 30 
miles south of washington dc fairfax county has had its share 
of trouble in addition to the rosie gordon slaying a thirdgrader 
was raped last year in an elementary school restroom 
that incident prompted the fairfax county public schools to 
institute a comprehensive childsafety program for the children and 
staff said assistant superintendent dolores bohen crisis 
counseling teams are routinely sent into schools when needed she 
said 
there are no solid numbers on how many missing children there 
are as these cases are not always reported and there is no central 
clearinghouse for the information 
scott mandel on loan from the corpus cristi texas sheriffs 
office to the center for missing and exploited children estimated 
that at any point 1 million to 15 million children are missing 
of whom the majority are runaways or socalled throwaways children 
kicked out by their parents most return the same day he said 
the next largest number are parental abduction cases involving 
50000 to 300000 children he said 
police confirmed that melissas father michael brannen a toy 
store manager in garland texas who has not seen the girl in two 
years was in texas when she disappeared police dont think her 
disappearance is part of a domestic dispute 
as for abductions by strangers he said the center had heard of 
511 cases during its first five years of operation ending sept 30 
of those 158 children had been returned alive 112 were located 
dead the rest are still missing 
ms brannen a single parent who was working as an accountant 
for a defense contractor and parttime for two jewelry stores 
rarely sleeps these days shes never alone family and friends 
answer the phone 
she castigates herself for not being more cautious about melissa 
although she estimates it took only two minutes at most for melissa 
to vanish 
you can say lots of i should have dones she says i 
shouldnt have taken her to the party 
the not knowing is the toughest part says mandel to 
get a feel for what its like a moment of what theyre going 
through is when you lose your child in a mall those 10 minutes 
turn into what some of these parents have gone through for 10 
years those moments of hell that you went through momentarily 
is what theyre living

watergate figure maurice stans offer to 
donate his family home and a new museum to the city has been 
rejected because officials dont want to be responsible for the 
upkeep 
stans the onetime cabinet secretary who pleaded guilty to minor 
campaign violations in the watergate case but was acquitted of more 
serious charges said he wanted to show young people in towns like 
shakopee that they can make it big outside their small communities 
he offered to turn over to the city the family home a small 
adjacent park and a museum that he would build 
stans was deputy postmaster and budget director under president 
eisenhower and secretary of commerce under president richard nixon 
as well as chairman of nixons campaign finance committee he was 
born in shakopee in 1908 and lived there until he was 17 
stans proposed half the museum be reserved for his memorabilia 
and the other half could be used by the city for other artifacts of 
shakopee a town of 10000 about 15 miles southwest of minneapolis 
in return he wanted the city to promise to maintain and staff the 
buildings 
city administrator dennis kraft said friday that the city 
council decided it did not want to make that kind of longterm 
financial commitment 
stans was indicted along with former attorney general john 
mitchell on 10 counts of perjury and conspiracy involving a 
200000 contribution from financier robert vesco they were 
acquitted by a jury 
stans later pleaded guilty in a separate case stemming from 
watergate to five nonwillful violations of campaign financing laws 
and paid a 5000 fine 
stans has continually held that he had absolutely no part in 
watergate 
earlier at least two members of the shakopee city council said 
that the trial and the fine would have no bearing on their decision 
on whether to accept stans gift

it wont be bristling with brawn but 
the men of smith college calendar will have plenty of academic 
appeal say students at the allwomen school 
what we were focusing on was their intellect and not their 
body said senior marie macri who thought up the idea as a 
fundraising project for the porcupine rag an annual humorous 
magazine she coedits 
the calendar expected to go on sale in february for 4 
features models from all over campus including professors 
security guards and a cook 
we were tired of hearing there were no men at smith college 
said caitlin hamilton coeditor of the rag 
also featured in the notyetcompleted calendar are harpo the 
pet poodle of smith president mary maples dunn and a shot of a 
nude bronze statue 
hamilton said the calendar isnt intended to make fun of the 
models or as an exercise in reverse sexism models had the final 
say on the pictures used and a statement attached to the calendar 
states its role as a tribute to the men of campus 
associate art professor craig fulton said he had no qualms about 
posing once he discovered the academic focus of the publication 
i think this shows the seriousness of the students at smith 
fulton said friday once the body goes the mind is left lets

soviet leaders eulogized andrei d sakharov on 
saturday as an honest and sincere humanitarian then dove back into 
a parliamentary battle with the very opposition movement he helped 
found 
in what amounted to a public apology mikhail s gorbachev and 
other leaders signed an obituary that appeared in saturdays 
newspapers saying sakharov who died thursday had been the victim 
of gross injustices 
a distinguished scientist and public figure a man of honesty 
and sincerity has passed away the obituary said in the 
governments highest public praise for sakharov since he turned in 
the 1960s from a prizewinning physicist into the dean of soviet 
dissidence 
everything that andrei dmitrievich did was dictated by his 
conscience his deep humanitarian convictions it said 
but within hours after the newspapers came out the leadership 
was back fighting the feisty parliamentary group that sakharov 
urged to become a fullfledged opposition just before his death 
the group which numbers about 400 of the soviet congress 2250 
deputies has denounced many government policies but shied away 
from actually declaring itself an opposition 
prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov hit back at the sakharov 
faction at saturdays congress session implying that it was 
plotting subversion by opposing his program for economic reform as 
too conservative 
he said it was no accident that the faction the 
interregional group rejected the government program as not 
radical enough and proposed putting off a decision on the economy 
that will take away the opportunity to stabilize the situation in 
the country he said 
the interregional group meanwhile pressed forward toward a 
compromise on whether it will become a true opposition as sakharov 
wished 
the faction will issue a declaration on its opposition to 
specific government policies on monday said historian yuri 
afanasyev one of the groups leaders 
afanasyev speaking to reporters in the lobby of the kremlins 
palace of congresses also broached the idea of starting a 
nationwide democratic movement named for sakharov 
during these days of mourning we have to think about how to 
fill in the enormous gap that was left in the democratic movement 
with andrei dmitrievich sakharovs death afanasyev said he 
represented such a powerful force that he took the place of several 
such movements all by himself 
for the second day crowds of mourners massed outside the 
10story gray building where sakharov lived 
about 150 people gathered on the snowy sidewalk in front of 48 
chkalova street weeping and reminiscing about sakharov and his 
ideals placing red and white carnations on makeshift shrines and 
lighting candles before his portrait 
thanks and forgive us the stupid ones read an entry in a 
notebook for mourners comments lying on a small table a candle 
stood atop a small box bearing the inscription the mind honor 
and conscience of our nation has died 
sakharovs body is to lie in state in the capitals youth palace 
on sunday and burial is planned the following day 
afanasyev complained that the congress had not properly honored 
sakharovs memory on friday with just a brief speech and minute of 
silence the government made itself look bad when faced with such 
a loss equal to the death of tolstoy churchill or gandhi 
the youth newspaper komsomolskaya pravda accused the deputies 
who made even that formal show of grief for sakharov of being 
hypocrites 
i could not shake off the thought that in that very hall and 
not so long ago sakharov stood on the tribune and ended his speech 
with people applauding derisively stomping their feet and 
shouting at him reporter pyotr voshchanov wrote what did he 
feel then and what do those people who tried to force him off feel 
now 
the official government obituary signed by gorbachev five other 
members of the ruling communist party politburo and 50 other 
leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of 
sakharov on page 4 of the party daily pravda 
such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and 
scientists and pravda emphasized the importance of the 1975 nobel 
peace prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a 
funeral commission in a black box on its front page 
missing from the obituary were the signatures of several other 
politburo members including kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov and 
leading conservative yegor k ligachev absence of their signatures 
could signify that they disagreed with part of the obituary 
the obituary praised sakharovs vision as a scientist which 
made him the youngestever member of the academy of sciences at age 
32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the soviet 
hydrogen bomb 
sakharov later sacrificed the perks and honors due a top 
scientist to pursue a human rights campaign that spanned three 
decades and made him the conscience of the nation it also resulted 
in him being subjected to internal exile forcefeeding and kgb 
harassment gorbachev freed him in 1986 after nearly seven years in 
exile in the remote city of gorky

one man was convicted of smuggling hashish and 
another of money laundering in the first britishsoviet drug 
investigation and officials say political reforms in eastern 
europe should lead to further cooperation 
a jury at chelmsford crown court east of london deliberated 13 
hours before finding the men guilty on friday three others had 
pleaded guilty in september and two were acquitted 
the operation was the first success of a 1987 agreement between 
prime minister margaret thatcher and soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev to exchange information and work together to fight drug 
trafficking 
operation diplomat began after soviet customs officers on the 
afghan border found 3 tons of highquality black afghan hashish 
concealed in a consignment of licorice root destined for britain 
soviet authorities allowed british officers to track the 16 
million worth of drugs to find the smugglers 
the hashish traveled through moscow and traced to the tilbury 
docks outside london where it arrived on march 31 several weeks 
later the drugs were taken to a london warehouse where police and 
customs agents arrested the british smugglers 
british customs officials say no soviets were arrested 
during the britons 11week trial vladimir skripnik a senior 
soviet customs officer became the first soviet law enforcement 
official to testify in a british court 
cooperation is only possible as a result of the changes that 
have taken place and are now taking place in the soviet union he 
said afterward this would have been impossible not long ago 
douglas tweddle britains chief customs investigator said 
further joint investigations were expected and that britain hoped 
for similar cooperation with other eastern european countries in 
light of recent political reforms 
operation diplomat is an excellent example of how such 
agreements can help both parties he said 
the jury convicted martin reeves 42 of smuggling nearly 3 
tons of hashish and andrew george 37 of laundering drug money 
judge brian watling delayed sentencing until he receives a 
request from britains customs and excise authorities for the 
confiscation of more than 8 million of their assets 
earlier james rose 53 who was described as the leader of the 
drug ring and alan small 54 pleaded guilty to conspiring to 
import hashish between august 1984 and april 1988 roses son 
richard 25 pleaded guilty to importing the drug

the drive across the bridge past 
impassive east german border guards was both without precedent in

the quiet motorcade to potsdam carried secretary of state james

committed the bush administration to a rescue operation for east 
germany as winter approaches 
in his 65minute meeting with hans modrow the reformist prime 
minister and a second session in a 19th century church with 
lutheran ministers who helped bring down the old discredited 
rulers baker heard a tale of a tenuous regime struggling to make

maelstrom of german politics the reunification debate and a 
uniquely dangerous display of what he calls people power 
tuesdays foray after breakfast with west german chancellor 
helmut kohl and a symbolic visit to the disintegrating berlin wall 
topped a busy fiveday trip to europe in which baker also advanced 
a new architecture for the north atlantic treaty organization 
and strengthened us ties to the 12nation european community 
baker neared the end of his trip saturday when he joined 
president bush on the caribbean island of st martin where bush 
was discussing eastwest relations with french president francois 
mitterrand 
the accelerating sweep of economic and political change in 
eastern and central europe calls for policy adjustments in the 
west especially from the united states from a cold war posture of 
confrontation 
the soviets are adjusting too on tuesday foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze will call on nato secretarygeneral manfred 
woerner at his brussels headquarters not for negotiations the 
former west german defense minister said 
when poland and hungary first broke away from orthodox 
communism the bush administration responded with what leading 
congressional democrats and many analysts considered to be undue 
caution even timidity 
congress forced increases in aid programs and pushed the white 
house to respond to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs bold 
arms control programs and need for western technology and economic 
advice 
one of the decisions taken while baker attended a twoday 
meeting of the north atlantic council in brussels was a call for a 
logical system of separating sensitive technology from other 
material that can safely be exported to the east 
we think its still important to protect strategic technology 
but we should rationalize the process to the extent that things 
that are available to some extent off the shelf are not locked up 
in a bureaucratic process particularly at this time of 
significant reform baker said friday at a news conference in 
brussels 
this time around as czechoslovakia bulgaria and especially 
east germany shed hardline leaders and marxist economics the bush 
administration is out front with the promise of the same kind of 
aid given poland and hungary if they keep it up 
there may even be a special food grant to assist the modrow 
government through the winter and to give it better than a 5050 
chance of surviving to hold the elections scheduled for may 
the ministers baker saw on tuesday told him the next stage in 
the east german revolution could be retribution against former 
party officials and the military 
while baker was in europe there were more reports of attacks on 
security officers and performers who had enjoyed privileges under 
the old order on tuesday while baker was in berlin and potsdam 
the novelist kristof hein said in an interview with the communist 
youth newspapers junge welt that east germans had to guard against 
creating new injustices 
otherwise he said in 20 years we will not only be 
commemorating the victims of stalinism but well also have to 
rehabilitate the victims of destalinization 
bakers public statements after seeing modrow harped on one 
theme that the political and economic changes must be brought 
about peaceably 
it is that as much as anything else that represents the 
political signal that we desire to send by being here today he 
said standing alongside the embattled prime minister in a crowded 
hotel driveway 
the trip to potsdam where the allied leaders in world war ii 
made preparations for dealing with a defeated germany and a 
partitioned berlin was not on bakers schedule when he set out for 
europe last sunday 
us ambassador richard barkley is credited with persuading 
baker at a meeting monday night to go to potsdam the next day to 
show support for the east german government 
baker sent a cable to moscow reassuring the kremlin the visit 
was not intended to be provocative and he crossed the glienicke 
bridge in a stately motorcade that attracted little attention from 
onlookers 
it was the same bridge the late american u2 pilot francis gary 
powers and celebrated jewish dissident natan scharansky crossed to 
the west after being freed from soviet prisons 
baker urged modrow to press ahead with political reform he 
softpedaled the explosive issue of reunification with west 
germany which has jangled nerves in poland the soviet union and 
france 
while economic reunification appears inevitable baker wants 
political union to be gradual 
in brussels baker urged the nato allies at the annual winter 
foreign ministers meeting to consider the new architecture for 
europe he had outlined in a speech tuesday to the berlin press club 
the plan is designed to transform the 40yearold military 
alliance as eastwest tensions ease into a mixture of political 
economic and military elements 
the allies liked several of the specific baker proposals they 
will consider setting up panels to monitor troop reductions in 
europe and taking on the role of referee for regional conflicts 
stopping next at the european commission baker won support for 
stronger us ties to the european community as it moves toward 
economic integration of western europe in 1992 
on a third front baker participated in decisions by a group of 
24 nations to commit 6 billion in economic assistance to poland 
and hungary over the next several years 
baker who had told his partners that pledges of aid are not 
enough was pleased with the overall western response 
but he said friday night in the final analysis it is going 
to be up to the people of these countries the people power that 
has generated these peaceful revolutions it is going to be up to 
them to determine whether or not it succeeds

germany the newspaper said 
die welt did not identify the reputed american agents nor did 
it identify the sources that provided the information in its report

information about a pending spy swap and would be unable to 
discuss the matter if he did

washington felix s bloch the diplomat suspected of spying 
for the soviets said saturday it appears he no longer has fbi 
agents trailing his every move 
it was strange said bloch a 30year state department 
veteran who came under fbi surveillance last spring but has never 
been charged with any wrongdoing it was as if they left from one 
minute to the next 
fbi spokesman charles steinmetz acknowledged there may have been 
some visual changes but the investigation continued 
we may have cut back but were still investigating he said 
saturday i have no comments beyond that but it is an active 
investigation 
bloch who spoke to a reporter in a washington grocery store 
near his home said i like my freedom he said the obvious fbi 
tail appeared to have faded away about a week and a half ago 
in july and august a host of journalists and camera crews joined 
the government agents in following bloch everywhere including long 
treks in the capital and up to new york to visit his relatives 
bloch 54 declined to comment further saying his attorney told 
him not to speak to reporters 
intelligence experts have said that even if roundtheclock 
wheellock surveillance were dropped a less obtrusive 
surveillance might take its place in that instance agents might 
regularly drive by or check back to see that a target was keeping 
to his usual schedule 
such less obtrusive surveillance could be accomplished without 
the targets knowledge these experts have said 
meanwhile the los angeles times in saturdays editions cited 
sources as saying the fbi has failed to find solid evidence to 
support espionage charges against bloch and has all but abandoned 
hopes of prosecuting him steinmetz declined to comment 
the state department put bloch on administrative leave on june 
22 saying the fbi was investigating him in connection with 
allegations of illegal activities involving agents of a 
foreign intelligence service 
intelligence sources have said bloch who served at us 
embassies in east germany and vienna passed a briefcase to a 
soviet agent last may in paris that same agent later was monitored 
giving bloch what us officials said was a telephone warning that 
he was under suspicion the sources have said 
other electronic surveillance is said to have picked up bloch 
telling his wife that he had accepted payments from the soviets a 
former viennese prostitute has told a federal grand jury that bloch 
spent roughly 10000 a year for her services over seven years an 
amount that investigators cannot find withdrawn from blochs 
acknowledged bank accounts 
in a september interview with the austrian daily die presse 
bloch said he would write a book to set the record straight but he 
repeatedly has passed up chances to deny the allegations saying 
instead the government has not been able to bring charges much 
less prove them

gov rose mofford says she agrees with the state 
attorney generals assessment and will tell the state parole board 
that her commutations of two murder sentences are void 
attorney general bob corbins opinion friday said the 
commutations of james hamm and carl kummerlowe could be considered 
void because the parole board that recommended them earlier in the 
year did not fully comply with a victimnotification law 
the attorney generals opinion confirms my original belief 
that these commutations were flawed and must be considered void 
mofford said in a statement 
hamm and his wife prisonerrights activist donna leone hamm 
would not comment on the ruling kummerlowe has refused to comment 
in the past and was unavailable because of an alleged disciplinary 
lapse that placed him in lockup 
kummerlowe 62 was sentenced to life for the 1969 killing of a 
servicesation manager who was bludgeoned to death dismembered and 
packed into ice chests 
hamm 37 was sentenced to life in prison in 1974 for two 
drugrelated murders 
the judge who sentenced kummerlowe said he should never be 
paroled and former gov bruce babbitt rejected the parole boards 
recommendation in 1986 that kummerlowes sentence be commuted 
both inmates were model prisoners who had rehabilitated 
themselves through service to others the parole board had said 
mrs mofford said she based her decision to commute the sentences 
earlier this year on that report 
corbin said friday that there were no arizona cases detailing a 
governors power to reverse commutations and that courts in other 
jurisdictions had split over the issue 
the victimnotification law requires notification to the 
victims family prosecutors and a judge before any commutation or 
parole hearing corbin said and there is no evidence that the 
notifications were sent out to all the necessary parties 
board chairman arter johnson a mofford appointee did not 
return calls immediately

irans divided military forces saturday 
completed their most extensive maneuvers in the persian gulf in a 
decade and proved they could work together tehran radio reported 
the broadcast monitored in nicosia quoted navy commander rear 
adm ali shamkhani as saying that some good and amazing results 
were gained in the maneuvers 
he said the exercise demonstrated that the regular armed forces 
could effectively coordinate with the revolutionary guards to repel 
any threat the radio reported 
the 350000strong revolutionary guards were formed during the 
1979 islamic revolution as an ideologically reliable force to 
counter an army trained under the late shah mohammad reza pahlavi 
but the regular navy army and air force were constantly at odds 
with the revolutionary guards during the eightyear iraniraq war 
which has been halted by a ceasefire since august 1988 
both forces have opposed efforts to merge them but president 
hashemi rafsanjani has combined the defense and guards ministries 
to streamline the chain of command and improve coordination 
the iranian air force and regular army also participated in the 
maneuvers which covered 7500 square miles of the gulf and the 
adjacent gulf of oman the radio said 
it said that more than 10000 men took part and that tens of 
navy destroyers missile craft troop carriers hovercraft jet 
fighters minedetecting helicopters and revolutionary guards 
vessels were involved in carrying out complex electronic warfare 
operations and amphibious landings 
tehran television also monitored in nicosia showed a number of 
patrol boats destroyers hovercraft and landing craft in the gulf 
on friday 
the radio said the revolutionary guards who have their own air 
and naval wings used for the first time two new types of 
iranianbuilt speedboats armed with small multiple rocket 
launchers 
the vessels classed as imam1 and imam2 were constructed by 
the revolutionary guards defense factories the report said 
rafsanjani said last month that his navy had acquired vital 
equipment that would enhance its capability 
he did not elaborate but western military analysts believe iran 
may have deployed chinesemade silkworm missiles on its ships none 
of the vessels shown in the television broadcast appeared to be 
armed with silkworms 
the analysts said irans navy is short of usmade shiptoship 
harpoon missiles and has been seeking a new seaborne system 
iran is believed to have testfired a shipborne silkworm 
missile in the gulf three months ago 
the 58000ton uss new jersey sailed through the strait of 
hormuz into the persian gulf just before the maneuvers began dec 9 
the battleship the biggest warship to sail into the gulf in 
recent times left the waterway tuesday for its regular station

one hundred fourteen members of the house 
asked the state department on saturday to launch an official 
inquiry into reports of arrests and torture of demonstrators in 
east timor following pope john pauls visit there on oct 12 
in a letter drafted by rep tony p hall dohio the bipartisan 
congressional group asked secretary of state james a baker iii to 
order the us embassy in jakarta to investigate the events 
surrounding the demonstration and its aftermath and to urge the 
indonesian government to allow any detainees to be examined by 
doctors selected by their families 
the letter said as many as 40 people may have been detained 
after a demonstration by nationalists who shouted slogans praising 
the pope and demanding independence from indonesia which occupied 
east timor in 1975 the former portuguese colony is predominately 
roman catholic 
we are concerned about reports that several of those arrested 
were tortured to extract confessions the letter said while 
such reports are difficult to verify they would fall into a 
wellestablished pattern in east timor and throughout indonesia of 
mistreatment and abuse of detainees in the period immediately 
following arrest 
state department spokesman mark dillen declined immediate 
comment on the request saturday on grounds that officials had not 
yet reviewed the letter

solidarity leader lech walesa led about 
1000 people saturday in marking the anniversary of the killing of 
scores of baltic coast workers by security forces during 
prechristmas food riots in december 1970 
the annual observance at the towering monument to slain shipyard 
workers just outside the famed lenin shipyard has in the past been 
an occasion for conflict betwen demonstrators and police 
but with solidarity now legal and leading polands government 
walesa used the occasion to tell the crowd including union 
delegations from around poland that the slain workers of 1970 and 
of the december 1981 martiallaw crackdown did not die in vain 
a similar message was sent to the gathering by prime minister 
tadeusz mazowiecki himself a longtime solidarity activist and 
political prisoner 
i deeply believe that in the poland which we are now building 
such a sacrifice will never be needed again mazowiecki said 
now walesa said poles must steel themselves for the difficult 
period ahead as the government submits a tough economic austerity 
program to parliament sunday 
urging poles to accept the painful measures he said the 
greatest polish tragedy would be to try to solve complicated 
economic problems of the country in the streets 
let our children enjoy what we will build for them and not 
have to sacrifice their lives to mend what their parents spoiled 
he said 
today to the fallen shipyard workers we must erect a different 
monument let it be a just democratic and prosperous poland 
scores of shipyard and port workers were killed in 1970 during 
riots and strikes that erupted in gdansk gdynia and szczecin when 
the communist leadership of wladyslaw gomulka announced sharp food 
price increases just before christmas 
walesa then a young shipyard worker participated in the 
strikes and later became active in illegal efforts to memorialize 
the victims whose exact number has never been known 
after the rise of solidarity in 1980 one of the unions first 
acts was to dedicate the monument of three steel crosses to the 
slain workers at the shipyard gate on dec 16 of that year the 
10th anniversary of the outbreak of the riots 
walesa recalled saturday that at that dedication he did not 
imagine that just a year later nine silesian coal miners would be 
gunned down in katowice in a second december the martiallaw 
crackdown authorities ordered to crush solidarity

bidders at an art auction here on saturday panned 
a penandbrush piece purported to be drawn by pablo picasso but 
two people expressed interest in buying the work privately said an 
auction spokesman 
officials at kruse international an auburn ind auction house 
specializing in the sale of vintage cars said last week that they 
expected to fetch bids as high as 3 million to 5 million for the 
previously unknown portrayal allegedly by picasso of his mistress 
the piece went up on the block this morning said pat 
scanlon a spokesman for kruse there were no bids it is now 
being offered for private sale 
the owner of the drawing jewelry engraver jim montgomery of 
norman okla said he was given the work 11 years ago by a young 
couple he had helped out financially 
montgomery said the works authenticity was verified 
scientifically by ernest smith a forensic document examiner from 
oklahoma city but art experts said the verification process needed 
to be much more detailed 
i suppose all the media attention could have scared away 
bidders scanlon said in a telephone interview the weather 
hovering around 5 degrees as the auction was held at a downtown 
hotel could also have been a factor 
the portrait of a young woman probably will be sold privately to 
one of two people who expressed interest after the auction scanlon 
said he refused to comment further on a possible sale price 
doubts about the pieces authenticity persist 
francoise gilot whom the piece is supposed to portray said 
friday that she was skeptical the work was real because she was 
never contacted about it 
ms gilot the mother of picassos son claude and daughter 
paloma modeled for picasso from 1944 to 1953 when they lived 
together 
if they want to know if its correct they would ask my son or 
myself or my daughter said ms gilot herself a painter now 
married to dr jonas salk a medical pioneer in polio 
the fact that they did not ask anybody in the family is not a 
good sign she said in a telephone interview from new york 
but montgomery defended his decision to verify the work through 
a document expert rather than art historians saying he had heard 
the process has been used in the past to verify such pieces after 
months of waiting for the appraisal he said he was satisfied that 
the work was indeed a picasso

this is a serious disease a lethal contagious disease and 
our hands are tied for investigation reporting and protecting 
those around us said dr pierre provost chairman of the state 
commission on medicallegal investigation if we treated 
syphillis like we treat aids humanity would have been dead a 
century ago 
last week officials in new york city said they plan to test for 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome during all autopsies and to use 
the results to find out who else might be infected 
but a leading aids activist said the new york program is 
outrageous and he will oppose any such plan in massachusetts 
the dead person cant tell them who the contacts are so the 
medical examiners going to speculate about who the guys 
girlfriends or boyfriends are said larry kessler director of 
the aids action committee 
kessler said he would not object to anonymous testing during 
autopsies for statistical research 
mary ann hart a spokesman for the department of public health 
said her agency was not ready to take a position on the issue 
tom mcnaught spokesman for state attorney general james 
shannon said his office is consulting the department of public 
health and the medicallegal investigation commission on the issue 
shannon is concerned with the states aids confidentiality 
statutes which require consent from anyone being tested for aids 
mcnaught said

president fw de klerk and 
the leader of the nations zulus appealed for blackwhite unity 
saturday a national holiday marking a 151yearold battle victory 
by the afrikaners over the zulus 
de klerk an afrikaner told supporters in the orange free state 
province that he wants to open negotiations with black leaders on 
the countrys future 
the time is now for us to all get together and get more 
consensus said de klerk who has sought to ease racial tensions 
since taking office in august 
rightwing afrikaners opposed to power sharing with blacks 
countered with several rallies demanding strict apartheid and 
continued white domination 
in boksburg an industrial town outside johannesburg and in 
mossel bay a southern coastal town blacks canceled demonstrations 
to avoid confrontations with rightist groups 
afrikaners were celebrating the 1838 great trek during which 
their dutchdescended ancestors left the britishruled cape colony 
for the uncharted african wilderness 
stories about hardships on the journey and battles with african 
tribesmen have taken on mythical proportions for the 3 million 
afrikaners who make up about 60 percent of south africas white 
population and control the government 
the afrikaners preparing for a major battle with the zulus on 
dec 16 1838 vowed to make it their holiest day if they won the 
fight they did and the anniversary is known as the day of the 
covenant 
zulu leader mangosuthu buthelezi told 3000 supporters at a 
stadium in soweto the huge township outside johannesburg that it 
was time to consider signing a new covenant 
not between us and god as our afrikaner compatriots claim 
they did in 1838 but a new covenant between us as white and black 
south africans buthelezi said 
he also appealed for unity among the nations 28 million blacks 
and an end to three years of violence in natal province that pits 
his relatively conservative inkatha movement and the united 
democratic front a national antiapartheid coalition aligned with 
the african national congress guerrilla movement 
the front supports sanctions protests boycotts and other 
confrontational methods that buthelezi opposes 
despite his differences with the front and the outlawed anc 
buthelezi said i will not negotiate with the south african 
government until the day anc leader nelson mandela is released 
from jail 
mandela the countrys bestknown black leader is expected to 
be freed within weeks he met de klerk on wednesday to discuss 
prospects for blackwhite political negotiations

a pregnant woman who was caught 
smoking crack cocaine thanked police for arresting her and urged a 
judge to put her behind bars to keep her away from drugs until the 
baby is born 
julia gallashaw 37 agreed to a plea bargain intended to save 
her and her baby due jan 28 from her drug habit by putting her 
in jail 
shes the one who wanted to stay in there until she had the 
baby palm beach county judge william bollinger said friday i 
wholeheartedly concurred 
gallashaw was arrested wednesday by a pair of police officers as 
she smoked crack from a homemade plastic pipe 
initially charged with felony cocaine possession and possession 
of drug paraphernalia gallashaw pleaded guilty thursday to a 
misdemeanor charge of attempted cocaine possession 
the plea bargain calls for her to serve 90 days in the palm 
beach county stockade and nine more months on probation she will 
be required to submit to drug evaluation and treatment court 
papers showed 
officers ed wagner and david burkhardt had asked in their arrest 
reports that gallashaw be jailed at least until she gives birth 
they said the woman thanked them as they took the pipe from her 
hands 
she was very appreciative for being arrested wagner said 
he and burkhardt were checking the hallways of a boarding house 
known as a drug hangout when they came upon gallashaw smoking crack 
in a secondfloor bathroom wagner said 
gallashaw told the officers she had smoked crack throughout the 
pregnancy as well as two others that ended in miscarriages 
she said she had sought prenatal care in the early stages of 
pregnancy but had trouble getting transportation to a clinic she 
said she couldnt stop smoking crack and feared she would miscarry 
again 
most police officers probably would call her scum and a 
criminal but we didnt feel that way wagner said she knows 
smoking would hurt her baby but she was so addicted she couldnt 
help herself 
women who use cocaine while pregnant risk a premature birth or 
separation of the placenta and their babies usually are smaller 
than normal have smaller heads and show signs of learning 
disabilities

president bush discussed the changes 
in eastern europe with french president francois mitterrand on 
saturday and said the united states would be very responsive 
to any request for emergency wintertime food aid from east germany 
bush said that except for some nuances he and the french 
leader are in general agreement on the big questions of how to 
react to the political upheaval sweeping eastern europe he did not 
elaborate 
at a joint news conference that wrapped up their oneday 
caribbean retreat mitterrand expressed satisfaction with 
usfrench relations he said secretary of state james a baker 
iii showed great understanding of the needs of europe when he 
pointed the way to a new role for nato in a speech last week baker 
suggested nato oversee reductions of troops and armaments and take 
news steps to build contacts with the east 
at the same time the french leader hinted broadly at 
differences over the issue of german reunification with west german 
chancellor helmut kohl 
said mitterrand mr kohl is a patriot and he obviously has 
reflexes which are not mine 
bushs voice was raspy from a cold and laryngitis as he and the 
french president fielded questions after holding private talks on 
this sunsplashed island in the west indies 
on another subject bush said he had no second thoughts about 
his muchcriticized decision to send two top aides to china last 
weekend for the first highlevel contact since beijing brutally 
crushed prodemocracy forces in tiananmen square 
he said he already seen an indication a couple of 
indications of positive results from chinese leaders but did not 
provide details 
bush also said he was delighted yesterday when the colombian 
government brought to bay the i think the man who is ranked the 
third most prominent narcoterrorist in colombia mr gonzalo 
rodriguez gacha gacha was shot to death in a gunfight with 
colombian police but bush did not directly refer to the mans 
death 
it was a very courageous effort on the part of the colombians 
i think we ought to salute them he said 
bush and mitterrand both said they had discussed the change in 
eastern europe where several hardline communist regimes have been 
swept away in recent months with the encouragement of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
bush was asked if he would be willing to consider emergency food 
aid for eastern germany whose citizens are among millions in 
eastern europe striving for greater freedoms after four decades of 
communist rule 
obviously if theres emergency food aid required there we 
have no request for that but if its required we would be very 
responsive and would like to think others in the alliance would 
be bush said 
baker joined bush for the talks at the end of his european trip 
which included a stop in east germany for a meeting with the 
reformist government leaders as well as opposition figures his 
trip to east germany was designed to bolster the government as it 
plans for elections in the spring 
as for eastern europe bush said 
we spent a lot of time talking about eastern europe and the 
dynamic changes taking place there and inside the soviet union and 
i would simply not go into detail on this answer except to say i 
feel very close to president mitterrands views here there may 
be some nuances of difference but in terms of the big questions of 
eastern europe i feel reassured that president mitterrand and i 
are viewing these the same way 
one of the nuances appeared to touch on the thorny issue of 
german reunification 
asked if the two men had an agreement to slow west german 
chancellor helmut kohls vision of closer ties between east and 
west germany bush said no 
mitterrand said he had used an analogy in discussing european 
changes with bush if the horses of the team dont move at the 
same speed there will be an accident he said 
bush also dismissed the possibility of improved ties with libya 
saying he had not seen hard evidence of a renunciation of 
international terrorism 
bushs decision to send national security adviser brent 
scowcroft and depury secretary of state lawrence eagleburger to 
china last weekend provoked sharp criticism in the united states 
but the president said he had no second thoughts 
he said each country needs to decide whether to maintain the 
sanctions against beijing that were implemented in the wake of last 
junes crackdown but that he would advise against lifting any 
measures in place 
even so the administration said several days ago it might lift 
a ban on the export of three communications satellites that would 
be launched by the chinese 
en route to st martin white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said both bush and mitterrand felt they needed a facetoface 
meeting to discuss some of the more personal and private sides of 
the changes going on in eastern europe and their personal 
impressions of gorbachev and whats going on in the soviet union 
european leaders at their meeting at strasbourg last weekend 
endorsed the concept of a single germany but suggested a series of 
conditions to ensure stability in europe 
the strasbourg session hosted by mitterrand also produced 
statements praising gorbachevs initiatives and hailing recent 
changes in eastern europe 
mitterrand has been among european leaders urging that soviet 
concerns be taken into account when discussing the issue of german 
unification bush too has urged a cautious approach arguing 
against setting a timetable and saying the eventual decision must 
be acceptable to both east and west germans 
despite their close relationship france and the united states 
still have some areas of disagreement 
france which has not been a member of natos military command 
since 1966 has resisted the alliances evolution into the 
principal western forum for dealing with changes in eastern europe 
regarding the sale of goods to warsaw pact nations that might 
have military application the united states has taken a more 
cautious approach than mitterrand or other european leaders have 
advocated 
the restrictions on such trade are policed by a parisbased 
organization called cocom the coordinating committee for 
multilateral export controls made up of nato nations and japan 
mitterrand also has endorsed gorbachevs call for a 35nation 
conference next year to discuss changes in eastern europe bush has 
not

a poll of east germans commissioned 
by west german media showed 71 percent of those surveyed oppose 
german reunification according to results available saturday 
the poll conducted by two respected west german public opinion 
research organizations asked 1032 east germans of voting age in 
early december about their political views 
it was commissioned by the weekly news magazine der spiegel and 
the zdf television network 
spiegel reported in its latest edition made available to news 
agencies late saturday that only 27 percent of respondents said 
they supported the building of a common german state while 71 
percent said they opposed it 
the magazine did not specify the polls margin of error or 
provide other details 
about half the respondents asked who they would vote for in the 
first free elections in east germany set for may 6 1990 said they 
were not sure yet spiegel said 
another 12 percent said they support the communists 7 percent 
said they would vote for the newly formed opposition social 
democratic party and 5 percent said they were behind neues forum 
the largest of the proreform movements 
communist premier hans modrow was reported to be the handsdown 
winner in popularity among east german politicians and west berlin 
mayor walter momper and west german president richard von 
weizsaecker were selected as the bestliked west germans 
spiegel said the poll had a shortcoming in that 23 percent of 
the respondents were communist party members while less than 13 
percent of the population belongs to the party 
but it said the poll results were confirmed as representative by 
the emnid institute of bielefeld and by the mannheimbased election

opposition leader vaclav havel 
said saturday he would serve as president only if alexander dubcek 
gets a top government role indicating the two may have agreed to 
avoid a fight over the presidency 
in a nationally televised speech the oncebanned playwright 
said he would accept the presidency only temporarily until someone 
can be elected for the fiveyear term by a freely elected new 
federal assembly 
he said he would only serve if next to me whatever his 
official function may be will be alexander dubcek i will not 
allow any dark forces to put a wedge between me and him and 
therefore between the czechs and slovaks 
dubcek leader of the 1968 prague spring reforms had been 
considered havels main rival for the largely ceremonial post the 
vacancy was created a week ago when hardline communist gustav 
husak resigned after swearing in the countrys first noncommunist 
dominated government since 1948 
the new government came to power on a wave of democratic reform 
triggered by mass protests in the capital and other cities in which 
millions demanded political change the communists have ousted 
hardline leaders surrendered their monopoly on power and allowed 
free travel 
rumors circulating widely in prague suggested that dubcek 
expelled from the communist party in 1969 following the sovietled 
invasion that crushed his reforms had agreed to accept the 
chairmanship of parliament in exchange for supporting havel 
it was unclear whether dubcek would support havel or simply not 
compete for president another presidential contender is cestmir 
cisar the candidate of the czechoslovak socialist youth union 
dubcek on his way to a dinner saturday given by visiting 
italian socialist leader bettino craxi said he and havel had 
been together from the very start 
leaders from czechoslovakias small socialist and peoples 
parties joined havel and dubcek at the italian embassy 
opposition civic forum spokesman petr kucera speaking at a news 
conference earlier said havel and dubcek had met saturday and 
both parties left assuming that agreement was reached for joint 
action 
kucera declined to say exactly when dubcek havel and a close 
circle of advisers met or provide details on what sort of action 
was planned 
havels speech directly addressed the communist deputies who 
dominate czechoslovakias parliament and under the constitution 
must elect a new head of state by dec 24 
if they dont want to risk strikes chaos and international 
shame i plead with them not to complicate the situation and not to 
expose themselves to the danger of being condemned by the public 
but to understand the call of this moment havel said 
very soon we should have someone suitable in the 
presidential castle preferably before the end of this year he 
said 
havel said the temporary presidents role would be to guide the 
country to free elections and oversee democratic reforms in the 
totalitarian system that has kept czechoslovakia in an iron grip 
for four decades 
the communistdominated federal assembly czechoslovakias 
parliament is scheduled to meet tuesday deputies arriving for the 
session will be confronted by students demonstrating their support 
for havel a symbol of czechoslovakias long battle for human 
rights 
since the triumph of the prodemocracy movement over the old 
communist leadership in a brief three weeks the ruling party has 
been in disarray 
on thursday the communists backed out of an agreement reached 
during intense negotiations the night before with the opposition 
and representatives from four smaller parties 
the failed accord called for extending the constitutional 
deadline to allow elections in parliament before the end of 
january it also called for the new president to be czech and 
unaffiliated with any party dubcek is a slovak 
dubcek has been seen by some communist deputies as the partys 
last best hope for keeping havel out of office he is the only 
figure to hold an equal place in the heart of anticommunist 
czechoslovaks and enjoys enormous popularity in his home republic 
of slovakia 
although expelled from the party for his reformist ideas the 
former communist party chief maintains his belief in socialism and 
has said he would run if called by the people 
regional civic forum representatives meeting saturday decided to 
ask noncommunist members of parliament to introduce a procedural 
amendment tuesday calling for a public vote broadcast live instead 
of the traditional secret balloting 
the opposition has begun a letterwriting campaign to pressure 
deputies to abide by the wishes of their constituencies and push 
the date of the vote to the next parliamentary session 
the most important thing is that people are tired of the 
political tension said civic forum spokesman josef vavrousek 
we have a new government with an unusual composition a 
parliament that is not trusted and no president we need a 
president to give our country stability 
the opposition is calling for the restructuring of 
parliament meaning the removal of discredited hardline communist 
deputies civic forum said 22 deputies have resigned and that 
others are under enormous pressure to do so the figure could not 
be independently confirmed 
however petitions are circulating widely in the capital 
demanding resignations 
excusing the confusion wrought by the stunning revolution 
vavrousek called the election of the presidency the second stage 
of a transition to a democratic state the first stage was aimed at 
the destruction of the totalitarian state 
you may have noticed its not easy to go from a totalitarian 
state to a democratic state in a democratic way

six months after opening underground is the new 
mandatory stop on the atlanta tour 
atlantans are bringing their relatives yuppies from around the 
southeast have integrated it into their weekend visits tourists 
and conventioneers ask for directions to it as soon as they get to 
town 
i think its kind of a tourist trap but its something your 
outoftown guests want to see said atlanta resident mary van 
ehrlich you take them to the top of the regency hotel you 
take them to stone mountain and now you take them to underground 
atlanta its one of the expected stops 
since the shopping and entertainment complex opened june 15 as 
many as 7 million people have trekked to underground said general 
manager william m coleman 
initial figres show only about 40 percent far less than the 70 
percent projected are from outside metropolitan atlanta coleman 
said 
the proportion of locals to outoftowners however is expected 
to drop during the traditional postchristmas retail slump this 
winter which is also a time when atlanta will have its biggest 
conventions in town 
but no matter where they are from those who venture into 
underground created in old storefronts that were once the heart 
of atlanta before a network of bridges over the railroad tracks 
literally raised downtown one level are spending an average of 
35 apiece coleman said 
gross sales volume for the 76 shops and pushcarts about 22 food 
court vendors and 17 restaurants and nightclubs reached about 36 
million through november about 20 percent above projections for 
the rouse co project rouse is the same company that developed 
bostons trendy faneuil hall shopping area and baltimores 
harborplace 
its very good but december will tell the tale because its 
such an important month for retailers coleman said 
although none of the original shops has gone out of business 
three nightclubs already have filed for reorganization in federal 
bankruptcy court a development coleman attributed to management 
problems and not sales volume 
some of the fast food vendors also have complained that their 
sales have dropped since the summer boom although other merchants 
say they had expected a slump in september and october 
i believe what is happening at underground atlanta is normal 
especially when many of the food operators there have little 
experience said retail analyst neil thall 
i see nothing indicative of a general problem with 
underground it takes a while for retailers at a large center like 
this to shake down said thall director of retail services with 
kurt salmon associates underground looks pretty healthy to me 
thats how it looks to ken piotrowski owner of the christmas 
factory and dante stephensen owner of dantes down the hatch 
both veteran georgia businessmen whose shops are doing considerably 
better than they had expected 
im doing 2 times the business i expected said stephensen 
whose nightclubrestaurant was one of the most popular in the 
original underground atlanta a complex that closed in the 
mid1970s after a decline blamed on petty crimes and transit system 
construction 
stephensen said he based his projections on graphs he kept 
during the 11 years he operated in old underground 
everything boomed in june july and august but we knew it 
wouldnt continue he said but the figures have eased back 
above projections for everyone assuming people made good 
projections 
piotrowski has been surprised by the amount of money people are 
willing to spend in underground and at his shop which features

marijuana smoking was the common link 
among a number of otherwise healthy young people who developed 
large fastgrowing cancerous tumors of the mouth and neck two 
doctors reported 
this was a rather shocking finding said dr paul donald a 
head and neck surgeon at the university of californiadavis who 
noticed the link in nine of his patients 
the patients included one man with a tumor bulging from his 
mouth to his chin a woman with a tumor under her tongue and a man 
with a huge mass on the side of his neck donald told a meeting of 
immunologists in clearwater on friday 
the surgeon said had seen such cancers before among people in 
their 60s who had been heavy drinkers and cigarette smokers for 
decades 
but the patients he treated had an average age of 27 one was 
just 19 
all had smoked marijuana during high school or college or 
during a tour of duty in vietnam some had smoked as few as two or 
three marijuana cigarettes a week others as many as six or eight a 
day he said 
the tumors in most cases were huge and fast growing donald 
said adding that he had to remove the jaws of several patients 
some lost part or all of their tongue 
one patient who smoked marijuana heavily in vietnam died but so 
far the others are doing well he said 
donald said he cannot prove that marijuana is the culprit in 
these cases but if its not he said its quite a coincidence 
sharing his concern was dr james endicott chairman of 
otolaryngology at the university of south florida in tampa 
although there is no conclusive evidence that marijuana caused 
the tumors theres something seriously wrong here endicott 
said 
its a phenomenon he said and its scary 
some of the cases he and donald have collected go back to the 
mid1970s endicott said he polled doctors in the tampa area and 
found about 50 patients under 40 with fastgrowing head and neck 
tumors all of those interviewed so far said they had smoked 
marijuana he said 
endicott has seen about two dozen of the patients including a 
31yearold woman who developed larynx cancer at 17 after smoking 
marijuana for two years she had a recurrence a couple of years ago 
but seems to be recovering he said 
a university research team is doing laboratory studies on 
patients tumor cells as part of a study that seeks to establish a 
cause of the cancers

here is a transcript of the news 
conference held saturday by us president george bush and french 
president francois mitterrand mitterrand spoke through an 
interpreter 
mitterrand ladies and gentlemen we have just completed our 
political conversation and we have spoken for several hours of 
those subjects which seem most important given the turn of events 
in the world you already have the lists i can imagine just in 
your own mind 
first of all the evolution of europe and naturally eastern 
europe and particularly eastern germany without forgetting 
others 
recent meetings with mr gorbachev the conclusions or what we 
could infer from these conversations enable us to compare point of 
views and our impressions and im waiting for the sound to be 
completely adjusted can you hear laughter 
and at the same time we dealt with all the subjects connected 
to the conference on their forms of disarmament and the forms of 
assistance name of the banks visavis eastern countries 
and moving from this major problem we dealt with it on other 
matters such as lebanon for instance and we considered the 
evolution of mind or attitudes visavis of problems arising for 
peace and the various pressing statements of the secretary of 
state mr baker what we both thought about it and what could be 
done to take into account the rapid evolution of events and 
situations it would be ridiculous to let themselves be superceded 
by events and at the same time one needs to assess them 
things move fast they moved very fast in these past few weeks 
and they might move very fast in the coming weeks and let us 
seriously consider what is going on from day to day without losing 
sight of a desirable perspective well this is a list its a pure 
description what im doing here as i would like to the 
journalists who came to st martin i would like to leave it up to 
you to stress those points youre most interested in 
but first of all i would like to say how very pleased i was to 
be able to receive president george bush its a very great 
pleasure and a very great honor for our country as we are here 
here at home in french land and theyre our neighbor and friend 
a personal friend as well came to talk with us and to talk about 
the experience required during these difficult days our feelings 
and our values 
and i must say that from most point of views we reached a 
harmony of views and were able to develop a policy a common 
policy not only amongst ourselves but with others and therefore 
i would like to repeat here how very pleased we were in st martin 
to be able to receive george bush not only because as the 
president but also because of the people he represents and it 
occurred very informally as you see as it always does i felt 
somewhat the same atmosphere of we had in kennebunkport in the 
home of george bush and it continued exactly in the same spirit 
and i would very much like this to go on for a long time thank you 
bush thank you mr president let me simply thank you for your 
hospitality everyone else in st martin and to say that as with 
our earlier talks not just in maine but in paris at the time of 
that glorious celebration off in the corner at nato i learned a 
lot i can say to this distinguished group that i feel that france 
and the united states regarding these dynamic changes that are 
taking place are very close together and i would also add that i 
think it is very important that france and the united states be 
close together as we discuss the changes that are taking place 
so sir thank you very much for your warm hospitality i have 
only one complaint put it this way one regret and that is that 
we have to leave this beautiful paradise on such a short time 
schedule but you were wonderful to come all this way and from the 
american side my sincerest thanks to you sir 
mitterrand well a lot of people are asking for the floor 
first of all as were in france here american journalists 
therefore obviously i cant recognize you yes sir 
q for both presidents i understand that one area of 
disagreement between the both of you was on the subject of export 
controls on highly sensitive goods shipped into eastern europe the 
socalled cocom regulations president bush i wonder if at this 
point since youre making overtures in other areas you feel its 
time to relax these regulations and also if president mitterrand 
would respond too if you and the united states are in more 
agreement today on this than you were before the meeting 
bush one i did not have a discussion with the president of 
france on that subject two we should and will review our cocom 
our participation in cocom our discussions in cocom there are 
certainly still legitimate national security interests that must be 
preserved and i dont think we have one iota of difference with 
france on that but i think it is timely that we take a new look at 
some of the commercial constraints

three resolutions promoting christianity were 
rejected by a committee of the arizona republican party on 
saturday raising the threat of a floor fight at the gops state 
convention next month 
the resolutions were among nine submitted to the partys 
resolutions committee in advance of the jan 27 convention all 
nine were rejected 
republicans from pinal county south of phoenix who drafted a 
christian nation resolution passed at the partys last state 
convention submitted resolutions this year promoting diligent 
bible study restoration of christian prayer in public schools 
and recognition of the united states christian heritage 
anetta conant who was representing pinal county cast the only 
votes in favor of the resolutions which were rejected by 301 
votes 
ms conant said she was not surprised by the defeat i 
expected it she said 
she said she expected all three resolutions to be introduced 
from the floor during the state convention but was not hopeful 
they would be passed because many delegates who believed in them 
would not have the courage to vote their convictions 
pinal county delegates won passage of a resolution declaring the 
united states a christian nation during last januarys state 
convention the measure was introduced from the floor after many 
delegates already had left the meeting 
state republican chairman burton kruglick who is jewish 
engineered passage of another resolution five weeks later 
attacking those who promote racism antisemitism or religious 
intolerance 
kruglick wrote members of the resolutions committee before 
saturdays meeting urging rejection of the new resolutions 
the message sent by these three resolutions is one of 
exclusion and a clear disregard for those of other than christian 
faith kruglick wrote 
dean cooley of phoenix cochairman of the resolutions 
committee said steps have been taken to keep surprise resolutions 
from being passed at the jan 27 state convention 
we have a new rule that a copy of each resolution will have to 
be in the hands of each person before a vote is taken he said 
the resolutions committee also unanimously rejected a measure 
supporting the constitutional principle of separation of church 
and state 
kurt davis the state partys executive director said the 
committee decided that issue is dealt with adequately in the 
national republican platform 
other resolutions rejected by the committee supported 
floridation of water supplies establishment of a national 
presidential primary and protection of employees from mandatory 
polygraph tests

mandatory water restrictions 
havent started yet in droughtparched south florida but 
complaints have 
environmentalists charge sensitive wildlife in the drying 
everglades are being shortchanged and golf course operators worry 
that the winter tourist trade may wither along with their greens 
the south florida water management district adopted mandatory 
limits thursday on lawn watering and home car washing for 4 million 
people from key west through miami and fort lauderdale to palm 
beach county to combat the worst drought in 27 years 
some parts of the southeast coast are 33 inches below normal 
rainfall levels for the last 14 months heading into the dry season 
which runs through may 
the restrictions take effect monday and the grumbling has 
already started 
in times of water shortage wildlife interests suffer first 
and benefit last said paul parks of the florida wildlife 
federation we dont have a true water allocation system that 
actually shares adversity 
district policy says all water users must share the pain of 
water cutbacks 
nevertheless rosa durando of the audubon society of the 
everglades is upset that half of the 61 billion gallons of water 
diverted in november from the loxahatchee national wildlife refuge 
was shifted to sugar cane and vegetable farms the other half went 
into storage at lake okeechobee a primary drinking water source 
what crop thats grown in america other than sugar has a 
guarantee first and above anybody else against the vagaries of 
nature she said 
but ed barber of the florida sugar cane league said the 
diversion was a drop in the bucket that amounted to only a 
threeweek water supply at rationed levels 
everybodys going to get hit hard barber said frankly 
it is such a serious situation that were not placing blame on 
anyone 
meanwhile golf course operators are concerned about the 
implications of the cutbacks for their business a 5 billion a 
year business in the sunshine state 
a complex set of rules allows the watering of greens only at 
night and different irrigation times for the front nine and the 
back nine on 18hole courses 
district officials say golf courses are among the biggest water 
users consuming 250000 to 1 million gallons a night an average 
household uses only about 250 gallons a day 
the aesthetics are going to suffer said steve kuhn greens 
superintendent at miamis famous doral country club things wont 
be as lush 
heavily used public courses fear the worst with the new rules 
were not going to be able to keep up said carlos mckeon 
superintendent of the dade countyowned palmetto golf course in 
suburban miami its possible our fairways could just dry up die 
and get infested with weeds

a world war ii veteran saturday criticized the 
armys investigation into his claims that he singlehandledly killed 
more than 500 japanese soldiers 
the army said it wont give the medal of honor to david rubitsky 
because it could not prove his claims 
ill admit that i am 72 years old and maybe i dont think with 
a full head but when i talked with the investigators i began to 
think that maybe they didnt think with a full head rubitsky 
said 
rubitsky said he would continue his fight for the medal which 
he contends he was denied because he is jewish 
being jewish has a lot to do with it he said you have to 
be jewish to understand it 
rubitsky who lives in milton 40 miles southwest of milwaukee 
appeared at a news conference with joseph stehling a retired 
brigadier general who has signed an affidavit supporting rubitskys 
claims 
rubitsky claims that he killed up to 600 japanese in the new 
guinea jungle during a 21hour siege in early december 1942 
stehling signed an affidavit saying he inspected the battle 
scene and there were more than 500 japanese wounded or killed by 
rubitskys actions 
i saw the dead bodies lots of them stehling said 
saturday im frustrated a little bit because they dont believe 
me 
retired gen herbert smith who died in september signed a 
similar affidavit another affidavit in the case signed by a 
military messenger said a colonel now dead had denied rubitsky 
his medal because rubitsky was jewish 
lt col terry adkins chief of the armys military awards 
branch that made the decision said friday the army could not even 
prove fierce fighting occured during the period 
adkins said the army examined scores of documents including 
testimony from japanese prisoners of war battle logs and 
interviews 
rubitsky said the decision implied he stehling and smith were 
liars 
theyre not only calling me a liar these men saw what 
happened they said they saw it they signed the affidavits 
rubitsky said 
rubitsky told reporters he has spent 16000 since he began his 
fight for the medal in 1986 including the money he spent to travel 
to washington to present his case 
i wouldnt have spent 16000 if i was lying about 
something he said 
rubitsky said he doesnt know if there is an appeal proccess 
but said he intends to pursue the matter 
rubitsky said he began seeking the medal in 1986 after a reunion 
of the 128th regiment when it was learned that he had never been 
recommended for the medal 
the medal never entered my mind he said i wanted to 
forget the horrible things that happened out there

bush may i may i just add one word mr president weve 
spent a lot of time talking about eastern europe on the dynamic 
changes taking place there and inside the soviet union and i would 
simply not go into detail on this answer except to say that i feel 
very close to president mitterrands views here 
secretary baker had a chance to go over these matters with 
roland dumas and i think there is there may be some nuances of 
difference but in terms of the big questions of eastern europe i 
feel i would say simply reassured that president mitterrand and i 
are viewing these the same way 
mr president would it be all right to take under the policy of 
dual recognition the man that thought he had been recognized here 
laughter 
q thank you well my question is to president mitterand 
laughter so during your visit to south america president 
perez of venezuela suggested holding an international conference on 
haiti and i would like to know whether you discussed it with 
president bush and if so did he agree 
mitterrand we did not at all discuss this as you think but 
this is an important subject and which might come up in our next 
exchange of correspondence and i am sure well have many of those 
in 1990 
q do you fear an increase of terrorist attacks either blind or 
striking american interests in europe and did you evoke any reason 
the reasons for better protecting ourselves against terrorism 
mitterrand well quite a lot of information seems to show that 
there might be some awakening reawakening of terrorists intents 
particularly in some regions of the near east but from there to 
actually go on to the act and even specify the intention i mean 
there may be a great distance and i cannot prejudge this i really 
dont know the duty of states is to protect ourselves against 
terrorism and nothing can be done which might weaken the moral 
psychological and practical defense of police and security against 
such danger from this point of view as many others we have had 
relations of work and trust with the us and we shall continue 
bush we add to that that the cooperation has been superb and i 
was delighted yesterday this was not discussed today but 
delighted yesterday when the colombian government brought to bay 
the i think the man who is ranked as the third most prominent 
narcoterrorist in colombia mr gacha and that was a very 
courageous courageous effort on the part of the colombians 
and we have all different kinds of terrorists this 
narcoterrorism is simply outrageous and unacceptable and when you 
see a president of a battled country and colombia fits that 
description doing its level best to bring them to justice i think 
we ought to all salute him 
q inaudible on east germany do you have any specific 
prescriptions to keep the situation from running wild apparently 
its quite different from what was going on in poland and hungary 
mr president perhaps some instant food aid as winter approaches 
is there some special way to treat the east german chaotic 
situation 
bush i dont know theres a special way but we spelled out at 
nato the four points that relate to german reunification the 
strasbourg declaration under the meeting headed by president 
mitterrand addressed themselves to that question 
obviously if theres emergency food aid required there we 
have no request for that but if its required we would be very 
responsive as i expect others in the alliance would be 
q mr president president bush do you now have a special 
relationship with the french government and president mitterrand 
that rivals the supposed special relationship with the government 
of mrs thatcher and can you discuss that for us 
some audience laughter 
bush well put it this way theres not supposed to be any 
rivalry of this nature we have a special relationship with the 
united kingdom i think everybody knows it id like to think i 
have a very special relationship with president mitterrand and i 
can tell you that the ability to pick up the phone no matter what 
the subject is as i have done on occasions and he has done on 
occasions and have honest exchanges of information has been 
extraordinarily helpful i think to both sides i can speak for the 
us so i hope it is a special relationship but perhaps i ought to 
let the president of the republic speak to that 
mitterrand well i mean were not sometimes sentimental 
competition i mean there is room enough for several friendships 
in life i dont see why without necessarily moving to excess i 
mean you know the poet who wrote of the enumerable heart well 
not enumerable but one may have ones heart open to several 
friendships audience laughs

a recently unearthed state department memo 
shows that former secretary of state george p shultz approved a 
1985 white house plan to expedite us assistance to honduras to 
encourage the hondurans to remain firm in their support of the 
nicaraguan contras 
congressional officials regard the document as further proof of 
a quid pro quo to expedite us aid to honduras in return for 
that countrys support for the contra rebels fighting nicaraguas 
leftist government a source said saturday at the time congress 
had banned military aid to the contras 
they believe it also shows that shultz knew about the 
arrangement contrary to his statements to congress the source 
said 
the key document a feb 7 1985 memo from former assistant 
secretary langhorne a motley to shultz was turned up in a new 
search related to the irancontra trial of former national security 
adviser john poindexter 
the classified document now declassified was sent to several 
congressional committees on dec 5 with an explanation that it had 
not been turned up in earlier searches because of a computer 
matching problem 
the committee also received memos dated feb 13 and feb 19 
offering progress reports on the plan one of those describes 
efforts to move forward with a 35 million installment of us 
foreign aid to honduras and fulfillment of the quid pro quo 
deal 
its very telling said one congressional source 
as initially reported by the washington post motleys memo 
describes a white house meeting in which officials agreed on a 
course of action to bolster honduran support of the nicaraguan 
rebels 
it was agreed said the document initialled by shultz as 
his sign of approval that some combination of efforts was needed 
to encourage the hondurans to remain firm 
it went on to spell out a plan for expedited economic and 
military aid to honduras including an envisioned letter from 
thenpresident reagan to roberto suazo cordova then president of 
honduras although the presidents letter would not be explicitly 
linked to the specific reassuring actions listed above our 
intentions and expectations would be made clear in an oral demarche 
presentation the motley memo said 
the plan ultimately approved by reagan also contemplated other 
meetings with suazo including one by thenvice president bush 
questions were raised during the irancontra trial of 
poindexters deputy oliver north as to whether bush in his march 
16 1985 meeting with suazo had delivered a secret arrangement for 
helping the contras through honduras 
bush told reporters on may 4 there was no such discussion 
honduras there was no quid pro quo everybody that attended 
the meeting says there was no quid pro quo the word of the 
president of the united states george bush is there was no quid 
pro quo 
shultz who was said by his office to be traveling and 
unavailable for comment has repeatedly told congress that he was 
opposed to conditioning us aid to honduras on its support of the 
contras and that his view prevailed 
motley told the post that the document actually supports prior 
contentions there was no such deal he acknowledged that us 
officials informed honduras about their concerns for the contras 
and in turn entertained honduran requests for expedited assistance 
but that he said did not constitute a quid pro quo because no 
american ever offered to trade a for b 
rep david r obey dwis chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommittee on foreign operations said the discovery of the 
motley memo illustrates the correctness of our continuing to 
pursue the irancontra affair it also illustrates why there is 
such continuing suspicion on the part of congress of how much of 
the truth we are getting 
poindexter who headed the feb 7 1985 meeting described by 
motley faces five felony charges for his role in the irancontra 
affair

the communist party changed its name saturday 
and appealed to reformminded members to set a new course for the 
discredited party 
at a closed session of an emergency congress more than 2700 
delegates decided to change the partys official name from the 
socialist unity party of germany to the socialist unity party of 
germanyparty of democratic socialism 
the congress also was expected to adopt a more democratic 
platform before it completes its session on sunday 
the communists have been under increasing pressure from mass 
demonstrations demanding democratic reforms and in the past two 
months have ousted hardline leaders opened borders and promised 
free elections 
the communists will face challenges when parliamentary elections 
are held may 6 and one smaller political party and an opposition 
group also met saturday to discuss their goals and strategy for 
attracting support 
elsewhere in eastern europe on saturday 
czechoslovakias opposition movement demanded immediate 
presidential elections be held by parliament suggesting the 
leading contenders alexander dubcek and opposition leader vaclav 
havel had reached an accord on who should have the post exparty 
leader dubceks prague spring reforms were crushed by a 
sovietled invasion in 1968 
havel offered another indication that an arrangement had been 
reached when he said later he would serve as president only if 
dubcek is given a top role in the government 
several thousand protesters in sofia bulgaria demanded an 
official funeral service for the victims of stalinist purges 
including a communist party chief who was hanged after a show trial 
40 years ago 
solidarity leader lech walesa led a group of about 1000 
people in gdansk poland in marking the anniversary of the killing 
of scores of baltic coast workers by communist security forces 
during food riots in december 1970 
in a related development president bush said the united 
states would be very responsive to any request from east 
germany for emergency wintertime food aid he made the comment at a 
joint news conference with french president francois mitterrand 
following their brief summit conference on the caribbean island of 
st martin 
the east german communist congress gave party leader gregor gysi 
a standing ovation when he announced the partys new name 
we want to be a party that is thoroughly reformed and 
therefore a new name communist premier hans modrow told 
reporters 
the delegates also burst into thunderous applause when michael 
schumann addressing a party report on corruption accused ousted 
hardline leader erich honecker of ignoring public desire for 
reform 
the ailing honecker in a letter sent to the party leadership 
nearly a month ago and released to the delegates saturday conceded 
he had deceived himself about the state of the economy and the 
mood of the people but he rejected widespread accusations that he 
was corrupt 
the corruption report blamed honecker 77 and former economics 
chief guenter mittag for what it called political and economic 
errors that led to the successful prodemocracy movement and the 
decline of communist power 
the party has given up its constitutional mandate to rule and 
more than 700000 members have quit in recent weeks dropping 
membership to about 16 million 
honecker had to be replaced as party leader the report said to 
prevent a civil warlike bloody conflict with prodemocracy 
activists 
it said the party should carry no collective guilt for 
wrongdoing by disgraced former leaders but criticized members for 
failing to stand up to the corrupt party hierarchy 
honecker has been in seclusion since he was stripped of his 
party leadership posts on oct 18 he was expelled from the party 
on dec 3 for suspected corruption and put under house arrest two 
days later 
kurt hager the former party ideologist told reporters at the 
congress he felt guilty but that the errors of the past were a 
collective responsbility 
honecker is very sick but its another question about what is 
going to happen to him the party leadership will be judged 
but you have to prove the guilt of individuals hager said 
a guest at the congress was rudolf bahro was a former party 
member arrested for his critical views of orthodox communism and 
expelled to west germany in the 1970s he recently returned to east 
germany 
bahro a 54yearold intellectual told reporters that the 
communist partys reform effort was halfhearted and that the 
party must establish new ties to the population to gain support 
several speakers said the party would have to start its campaign 
early if it were to have a chance in the may elections 
meanwhile the christian democratic union one of the small 
political parties formerly aligned with the communists completed 
its own congress saturday and elected reformer lothar de maiziere 
49 to lead it 
the party plans to emphasize its religious roots to gain support 
from east germans the majority of whom are believers 
democratic awakening one of the betterknown reform movements 
opened a founding conference in leipzig and outlined its political 
course for the may elections 
the fledgling opposition group said a german confederation 
within a european peace order was the main aim of its platform 
it was not clear if democratic awakening supports reunification 
of the germanys or only close cooperation between the nations it 
has drifted away from most of the other reform movements 
including new forum that say east germany should remain a 
sovereign state 
the communist leadership also opposes reunification 
also saturday a regional newspaper reported that the nations 
secret police force once had planned a detention camp for 
counterrevolutionaries 
the report in the paper thueringische landeszeitung quoted an 
unidentified army major as saying the plans were discovered during 
a search of a former secret police office in the community of 
tautenhain near gera 
the current government is disbanding the oncefeared secret 
police network as part of east germanys democratic reforms 
honeckers hardline leadership had referred to some reforms 
activists as s counterrevolutionaries

mitterrand and then to classify isnt easy theyre also 
very french a very interesting thing thats called the map of 
love well to you journalists well just the map of love in 
french is up to you to decipher this map its not mine but what 
i do certainly hope is that we keep very close friendship with the 
united states of america as we shall have with the united kingdom 
q would you have given that answer before january 20th 1989 
mitterrand before the 20th of january what happened on the 
20th of january laughter you seem to remember my own feelings 
more than i do myself i would have said even before mr bushs 
election is that what you mean i mean from what i am able to 
deduce because you need a triple translation to get to your 
meaning i got a long very well with mr reagan and now that hes 
no longer president of the united states of america and i would 
want to say anything that might seem slight or restrictive thats 
the way history was and now with mr bush we are working together 
and i think in a very good close understanding but to say more on 
what youre interested in sir that is well just kind of 
sentimental press im certainly not going to say any more 
yes sir 
q president bush general noriega of panama who has long been 
a thorn in the side of the united states has just this week 
declared war on the united states how do you respond to this last 
outrage of general noriega 
bush well i dont respond to it i notice that he was made 
supreme leader or something of that nature it has not changed our 
view of him at all he is a narcotics an indicted narcotics 
dealer and he ought to get out and the minute he got out the 
relations between panama and the united states would improve 
dramatically 
and not only is he a narcotics indicted narcotics dealer but 
he singlehandedly aborted the free will of the panamian people 
the will being expressed in open and free elections and mr 
noriega singlehandedly sent out his dignity battalions to beat up 
the elected vice president and to keep the will of the people from 
being fulfilled and that is unacceptable as we see the world

bush monsieur 
q president mitterrand id like to ask you if you discussed in 
any way china and what you think of president bushs decision to 
send his envoys to china recently and if i could follow on that 
mr bush if perhaps youve had second thoughts about the nature in 
which this was donein the secretive fashion and in the toasting 
of the chinese while your envoys were there 
mitterrand thank you for this question well i should have 
said in my presentation indeed we did talk about china and this 
was at the initiative of president bush who himself expressed the 
wish of being able to give us his views on this subject and the 
reason for what was done so i think now you might hear this 
bush i have no second thoughts at all and being somewhat 
familiar with china ive learned that you listen to everything 
thats said in a toast weve looked at every word and analyzed it 
and im strongly supportive of this mission by general scowcroft 
and larry eagleburger ive said that i initiated it and im not 
going to go further except to say that i hope that it will have 
positive results 
and weve already seen an indication a couple of indications 
of that but i think knowing china again i think time is 
required but this is a billion plus people and i do not want to 
hurt the billion plus people further and i think weve made the 
right step and only time will tell how this leadership in china 
views the mission 
 
q is there any agreement between france and the us to slow 
down mr kohl in his drive toward reunification laughter 
mitterrand i have your answer is there an agreement or 
conformity of view to slow down 
yes theres a great conformity of views particilarly to slow 
down the as to considering slowing down mr kohl thats a 
specific matter 
but we think that everything as was said in strasbourg is to be 
done in the respect of treaties and the principles of helsinki 
and that at present there are two states and if the evolution 
seems to strengthen and hasten it would be a good thing for the 
german authority to contribute at the same time to give up the 
construction which is indispensable for the new european political 
order community etc 
chancellor kohl was telling me this yesterday as we were 
together in switzerland and he says it constantly and there is no 
reason to doubt this 
that i did not set any timetable to the aspiration which is that 
of all germans and particular mind towards reunification therefore 
i am not precipitating events even though i do hope for this this 
is what mr kohl said 
in any case he is to conform with the treaties and agreements 
which preside today to the european balance and therefore i dont 
have any particular complaints chancellor kohl is germany hes 
a german patriot and he obviously has reflections which are not 
mine 
but the main thing when we are together and when we speak as 
responsible for our own countries we sketch an outline which we 
can agree and in any case i shall be meeting with chancellor kohl 
on the fourth of january and next he shall be coming to see me in 
france 
yes sir 
 
q mr bush about china do you believe that other countries 
that follow the united states lead on sanctions should now relieve 
those sanctions to lighten them and how would you feel if they did 
that against your wishes 
bush i think each country has got to make its own 
determination but i think basically if i had to answer yes or no 
id say id say no i think theyve got to wait and see how 
matters evolve thats what were doing and i think its prudent 
and for those who suggested that i have normalized relations 
with this power because of one visit they simply are wrong off 
the reservation on that so i think thats a matter for other 
countries to determine 
more

the nations new interim leader 
says an election will be held in january to replace the president 
who was assassinated three weeks ago as european mercenaries took 
control of the islands 
the announcement came friday the day after about 40 mercenaries 
relinquished control of the country to french troops 
said mohamed djohar the new interim leader invited six 
opposition parties including the opposition democratic front to 
take part in a free and democratic presidential election 
djohar said the election should be held in midjanuary under the 
supervision of international observers 
french soldier of fortune bob denard and the other european 
mercenaries left the islands thursday and friday with some flying 
from moroni to paris and some to johannesburg south africa 
france the former colonial power sent 200 troops to the 
islands after djohar requested military assistance under a mutual 
defense treaty to restore the countrys security south africa is 
involved because it has a major financial interest in the islands 
off southeastern africa 
south african and french officials were reported to be trying to 
find a final destination for the mercenaries a spokesman for the 
south african government said the mercenaries should leave as 
soon as possible 
the exact number of mercenaries who were in the islands was 
uncertain south african government sources said there were about 
45 
the sources said more than 20 mercenaries and 17 family members 
including denards comoran wife and their two children left the 
islands thursday night on a flight to paris 
denard and the 21 remaining mercenaries were flown to south 
africa on friday 
the independent south african press association reported that 18 
of the 22 mercenaries who came to south africa left the country by 
plane saturday night it reported that an unidentified spokeswoman 
for the department of foreign affairs confirmed the 18 had departed 
but did not give their destination she said denard was not among 
the 18 
a south african airways flight left johannesburg for paris on 
saturday night and it was believed the 18 french mercenaries were 
aboard 
south africa wants denard to leave the government sources said 
but he is still negotiating with authorities in france where he 
faces legal charges stemming from his involvement in a failed coup 
attempt in the west african country of benin in 1977 
the soldiers of fortune who led and trained the comoran 
presidential guard had disarmed the regular army and effectively 
controlled the islands since president ahmed abdallah was 
assassinated nov 26 
most comorans believe denard or his men carried out the killing 
denard has claimed he was in the room when abdallah whom he 
brought to power in a 1978 coup was shot accidentally by a 
bodyguard 
denard who had taken out comoran citizenship married a local 
woman and acquired substantial real estate and business interests 
was seen arguing with abdallah before the assassination denard 
also is believed to have played a role in an attempt to overthrow 
the president of benin more than a decade ago 
all was reported calm on the comoros on saturday and two of the 
four french warships that had taken up positions near the islands 
on friday withdrew to the frenchadministered island of mayotte 
the 50 french troops remaining in the comoro republic took 
control of stocks of munitions formerly belonging to the 
presidential guard djohar has asked the soldiers to reorganize the 
comoran military until now split between the elite presidential 
guard and the poorly trained and equipped regular army 
the transfer of control from the presidential guard to the 
french forces at moroni airport ended several weeks of efforts by 
france and south africa to dislodge denard and his men 
both french and south african officials stressed that none of 
the mercenaries had been paid one cent in exchange for their 
departure denard had reportedly requested millions of dollars as 
the price of his leaving 
the comoro republic is made up of three islands off africa a 
fourth island in the archipelago mayotte remains french most of 
the 450000 african arab and malay residents are subsistence 
farmers with annual incomes of about 300 
in another development saturday a comoran politician accused of 
leading a failed 1985 coup was released from jail 
authorities freed moustoifa said cheikh leader of the 
opposition democratic front who had been sentenced to life 
imprisonment for the november 1985 coup that failed to topple 
abdallah

a slight wind shift brought a haze of 
ash from redoubt volcano drifting down on alaskas largest city and 
the kenai peninsula on saturday triggering power outages health 
alerts and warnings to motorists 
the volcano 115 miles southwest of here quieted down somewhat in 
its third day of activity but still belched ash skyward ash 
drifted as far south as oregon and was expected to reach 
california and arizona by sunday 
the us geological survey described the amount of ash sent up 
saturday as low to moderate significantly less than was hurled 
into the air friday with redoubts largest eruption since emerging 
from a 23year sleep the volcano southwest of anchorage began 
erupting thursday 
until the wind shift saturday fallout had been bypassing this 
city of about 250000 residents the kenai peninsula south of 
anchorage also had escaped the mess but the peninsula towns of 
soldotna and nikiski seemed to get the worst of it saturday 
im looking out my bedroom window and it looks like im 
standing on a beach said linell mccrumb of soldotna across cook 
inlet from redoubt she said about a halfinch of coarse ash 
covered the ground 
it was incredibly dark mccrumb said she said the ash cloud 
was so thick she couldnt see sunrise 
the soldotna police department told people to stay indoors and 
a 10point advisory issued by the state included a recommendation 
that people with lung ailments not venture out 
police in soldotna and anchorage advised leaving cars parked to 
limit the chance of engine damage some businesses covered 
sensitive computers and other equipment for fear ash would filter 
into buildings 
anchorage international airport stayed open but were getting 
very little traffic in or out said sgt charles barton an 
airport safety officer he had no estimate of how many carriers had 
canceled or diverted flights 
mechanics planned to inspect a boeing 747 airliner that made a 
safe emergency landing at the airport friday after it flew through 
ash lost power to all four engines and fell more than two miles 
the engines of the klm royal dutch airlines jet with 245 people 
aboard were restarted before the landing there were no reports of 
injuries the federal aviation administration said 
down in the lower 48 states pilots reported ash from the 
volcano was in the skies over idaho washington and oregon at 
altitudes of between 3 miles and 8 miles the ash should continue 
to move south reaching utah nevada california and arizona by 
sunday morning the national weather service predicted 
the ash in the sky over anchorage on saturday came at a time 
when daylight is in short supply the city is so far north that it 
gets only about 5 hours of light at this time of year the 
shortest day of the year in the northern hemisphere occurs in less 
than a week 
for a time saturday parts of soldotna and kenai lacked even 
artificial light ash settled on insulators and lines knocking out 
power to about 15000 to 20000 homer electric association 
customers around 5 am said john sorrels an area superintendent 
for the utility 
weve got all of our crews out working but its hard for them 
to breathe and see even with masks and goggles sorrels said 
power was restored promptly in some places but outages 
continued to occur he said 
geologist tom miller of the usgs said redoubt went through an 
ashspewing period of tremor for just over an hour early 
saturday morning and experienced another one that began at about 
615 am saturday and tapered off about 2 hours later 
our assumption would be that this would be going on like it is 
for a period of several days then i assume we would get a period 
of quiescence miller said then we may go back through a 
similar period of what weve been experiencing 
the logistical impact of the volcanic eruptions was felt as far 
away as barrow the united states northernmost community the high 
school varsity basketball games in the arctic coast town 725 miles 
north of anchorage were canceled friday because flight 
interruptions in anchorage made it impossible for visiting teams to 
travel 
daily deliveries of newspapers flown from anchorage and 
fairbanks were halted and some teachers from schools in outlying 
villages found themselves stranded in barrow unable to get flights 
out for the start of christmas vacations

a california endurance swimmer who has 
crossed the bering strait plans to risk the treacherous icy waters 
along the southernmost tip of south america next month 
lynne cox 32 of los alamitos plans to leave sunday for 
washington dc to to work out the final diplomatic details of 
her swim through the beagle channel a waterway along the 
longdisputed argentinachile border 100 miles north of cape horn 
the 5 to 15mile channel crossing marks ms coxs most 
ambitious swim the pacific and atlantic oceans collide in the 
narrow channel creating strong erratic currents and choppy waves 
water temperatures range from 38 degrees to 45 degrees 
scientists say that most people die of hypothermia after 20 minutes 
in 38degree water but ms cox plans to spend at least two hours 
in the water 
the swim is to take place between jan 11 and jan 25 depending 
on the weather wind and water currents 
this is going to be more difficult more cold more remote 
and more of a real challenge than anything i have ever done ms 
cox said in a telephone interview from her home friday 
she already has attracted international attention for dangerous 
endurance swims that would leave most other longdistance swimmers 
cold 
in 1987 she overcame superpower politics and the 39degree 
waters off western alaska to swim about five miles across the 
bering strait from little diomede island in the united states to 
big diomede island in the soviet union 
the unprecedented crossing drew warm praise from soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev who helped clear the way for ms cox 11mile 
swim in august 1988 across siberias lake baikal the worlds 
deepest lake 
both swims were intended to promote sovietamerican friendship 
the beagle channel swim is designed to symbolically bring 
together argentina and chile two countries that have fought over 
land around the channel for a century 
i like the idea of reaching beyond borders in many areas the 
idea of reaching beyond political borders and also the 
psychological borders she said 
the swim also is a test of her physical abilities 
i did the bering strait this is sort of to reach beyond that 
to see how much further you can go she said 
ms cox who is in prime distanceswimming form of 180 pounds on 
a 5foot6 frame also has crossed the english channel and the 
strait of magellan 
she plans to leave for buenos aires argentina on friday where 
she will stay until dec 27 from there she plans to travel to the 
argentine city of ushuaia where she will slowly acclimate herself 
to the channels frigid waters 
right now im going through all the emotions you normally go 
through in a day she said youre excited youre afraid 
youre uncertain youre hopeful all sorts of emotions 
but i do know that when i first go down there and put my toe 
in that cold water ill say my god what did i get into this 
time

hotair balloon saturday to the cheers of a throng of poor children 
as a downtown mission gave away thousands of toys trees and food 
to celebrate the christmas season

traffic and were filled with children and their parents mostly 
only mothers as volunteers placed toys and food into sacks to give

christmas christmas

vietnamese refugees demonstrated saturday to 
protest the forced repatriation of their compatriots in hong kong 
and released 51 black balloons one for each person returned to 
hanoi 
about 150 people attended the rally the first of a series 
planned around the country by the vietnam refugee national council 
to protest britains decision to repatriate boat people last week 
britain argues that most of the vietnamese confined to squalid 
camps in hong kong were fleeing poverty when they left their 
homeland not persecution and therefore dont qualify for refugee 
status 
the deportations tuesday were the first of thousands expected in 
coming years about 12000 boat people in hong kong have qualified 
as refugees under united nations criteria and will be resettled 
but about 44000 others face repatriation 
the protesters and their supporters gathered in trafalgar square 
in the rain and sang the old vietnamese national anthem in use 
before the communists came to power in 1975 then they stood 
silently in memory of those who died fighting communist oppression 
and listened to a series of speakers 
repatriation is evil guitarist steve hackett of the rock 
group genesis told the crowd we urge the hong kong government to 
dismantle the fences and the compounds 
hackett is the organizer of a group of musicians called rock 
against repatriation which is making a special recording of the 
song sailing once a hit for rod stewart with proceeds going 
to improve camp conditions it is expected to be released jan 20 
the rev michael meadows who worked in the former south 
vietnamese capital of saigon told the protesters our government 
ought not to be too gullible in accepting assurances from the 
government of hanoi that these people will be properly treated on 
their return 
vietnam has a very poor record on human rights and we ought to 
think once or twice before accepting their assurances he said 
foreign secretary douglas hurd has said the british embassy in 
hanoi will monitor the treatment of those returning but opposition 
lawmakers said it would be impossible to do that with such a small 
staff 
vietnam has told britain it rejects any forced repatriation of 
boat people from hong kong and reserves the right to send them back 
to the british colony 
a vietnam news agency report monitored in bangkok saturday said 
a foreign ministry official on friday delivered a note on vietnams 
position to the british ambassador to hanoi emrys davies 
the agency said the note affirmed the policy of rejecting forced 
repatriation and and only accepting those who volunteer to return 
or who are not opposed to the repatriation 
a british foreign office spokesman said the vietnamese message 
did not represent a change in that countrys position and that 
there would be no change in british policy 
britain has been criticized especially in the united states 
for forcibly returning the refugees 
the house of commons will debate the deportations on tuesday 
the government has halted further repatriations until after 
christmas

the newark episcopal diocese ordained a 
homosexual activist as a priest saturday in the most open challenge 
of a 1979 church resolution discouraging the ordination of gays 
im floating on air it was wonderful the newly ordained 
rev j robert williams 34 said at a reception afterwards 
thats not very articulate but its all i can do 
about 150 people attended the ceremony at all saints church 
which lasted nearly three hours and was interrupted briefly by a 
minister opposed to the ordination 
the rev skip robokoff of fort lee gospel church jumped up 
during the ceremony and shouted homosexuality is an 
abomination before being escorted out 
three demonstrators picketed outside the church 
williams officially entered the priesthood when more than a 
dozen visiting clergy gathered around him for a laying on of hands 
his livein companion james skelly a member of the churchs 
choir draped a red and gold satin vestment over williams 
shoulders before the ritual 
bishop john shelby spong who heads the newark diocese gave 
williams a bible and communion vessels he told the audience that 
because of the ordination our anglican community is more honest 
open loving inclusive and christlike 
the congregation applauded for a minute after the ordination 
ended 
two people were permitted to voice objections during the 
ceremony 
elaine sullivan of passaic representing the conservative 
episcopal synod of america said she objected because it is not 
in conformity with scripture 
theodore arnheiter of st marys church in tuxedo park ny 
echoed her complaint 
james solheim director of the national episcopal church said 
afterwards that the issue of ordaining homosexuals is just not 
resolved its been called the most divisive issue for the church 
since slavery 
he said a church commission is studying the question and will 
make report before the next meeting in 1991 of the general 
convention the churchs governing body 
the presiding bishop of the 25 millionmember episcopal church 
the most rev edmund l browning of new york said in a statement 
that he hoped the ordination will encourage positive debate 
rather than polarization 
the synod a conservative body led by bishop clarence pope of 
the fort worth texas diocese that also opposes the churchs 
ordination of women had asked spong to refrain from ordaining 
williams pope said the ordination violates a 1979 resolution of 
the general convention 
the resolution drafted two years after the ordination of a 
lesbian deacon in new york caused a stir says it is inappropriate 
for the church to ordain a practicing homosexual 
there is argument among episcopalians about whether the 
resolution carries the force of church law the synod says the 
resolution is law spong and other bishops who dissented in 1979 
say it is not 
church officials acknowledge that other gay people have been 
ordained since ms barretts ordination in 1977 but say none has 
been as politically active in homosexual causes as williams 
williams a texas native who started a ministry for homosexuals 
in hoboken called oasis in all saints said hundreds of episcopal 
priests are gay but most keep their sexual orientation private 
he said he wants to minister mainly to members of the gay 
community 
williams a graduate of the episcopal divinity school in 
cambridge mass has had a relationship with skelly 39 a 
hospital administrator since 1985 
skellys exwife suzanne and their daughters victoria and 
vanessa also attended the ceremony

the government has drastically tightened 
security to guard against retaliation by drug traffickers angered 
by the killing of one of the top cocaine cartel leaders an 
official said saturday 
police shot and killed gonzalo rodriguez gacha 42 during a 
raid friday on his hideout on colombias northern coast 
military officials stationed armored cars along several of 
bogotas main avenues and beefed up army checkpoints police and 
army troops remained on alert as president virgilio barco consulted 
with his security advisers 
naturally weve taken security measures to prevent any kind of 
retaliation interior minister carlos lemos said in a radio 
interview 
the head of colombias investigative police gen miguel maza 
marquez told a news conference late friday that terrorism might 
even increase as a result of rodriguez gachas death he called the 
killing a triumph for the government but said the drug war was far 
from won 
officials blame traffickers for 203 bombings that have killed 
199 people since the drug lords declared total war on the 
government last august in retaliation for barcos policy of 
extraditing drug suspects to the united states 
maza said authorities are pursuing colombias top drug baron 
pablo escobar with renewed optimism after their success in 
tracking down rodriguez gacha who had been considered among 
colombias most ruthless criminals 
at marigot st martin president bush on saturday hailed the 
colombian governments action as a courageous effort 
i was delighted yesterday when the colombian government 
brought to bay the i think the man who is ranked the third most 
prominent narco terrorist in colombia mr gacha bush said 
during a news conference after meeting in the caribbean with french 
president francois mitterrand 
earlier in the week bush announced he would travel to colombia 
next year for a drug summit despite security concerns the united 
states has backed the colombian crackdown on drug traffickers 
also saturday white house spokesman marlin fitzwater returning 
from the caribbean with bush said the president did not make a 
telephone call to barco to congratulate him after the shootout a 
spokesman for the presidential palace told the associated press on 
friday that bush had made such a call 
authorities revealed new details saturday about the manhunt that 
resulted in the death of rodriguez gacha his 17yearold son 
freddy and five bodyguards near the port of covenas 360 miles 
north of bogota 
the manhunt began last month after a raid on one of escobars 
hideouts according to a communique released by the sucre state 
police whose members participated in the search 
police said escobar was on his farm near cocorna 125 miles 
north of bogota when they raided it nov 22 escobar escaped but 
police found documents that gave them information about rodriguez 
gachas movements the communique said 
authorities tracked the trafficker to a rural area between 
covenas and the town of tolu 
the communique said a police helicopter spotted rodriguez gacha 
and his entourage fleeing in a truck 
initially they wanted to shelter themselves on a farm called 
tolugas the communique said later they split up fled to 
different sites and attacked police following them with grenades 
and firearms 
the communique said police were forced to shoot back killing 
all seven of the suspects rodriguez gachas body was found 
gripping a submachine gun emptied in the battle the report said 
it did little to clear up conflicting versions of how police 
discovered rodriguez gachas whereabouts 
bogotas la prensa newspaper quoting a reporter who accompanied 
police on the raid said authorities located the trafficker last 
wednesday in the port city of cartagena where he was meeting with 
freddy 
other officials reportedly said freddy who was captured over 
three months ago was let out of jail intentionally on nov 23 so 
that police could follow him to his father 
la prensa quoted the reporter as saying police lost track of 
rodriguez gacha when aware that they were looking for him he fled 
the city in a small boat bound for covenas 
the owner of the boat later told police of the traffickers 
whereabouts in an effort to earn the 581000 reward offered by the 
government for information leading to his capture la prensa said 
it identified its source as silvio cohen a correspondent for 
barranquillas el heraldo newspaper 
el tiempo colombias leading daily quoted a police official as 
saying authorities had acted on information provided by farmers in 
the area 
a bogota police spokesman reached by telephone said he could 
neither confirm nor deny any of the versions 
la prensa reported that rodriguez gacha killed himself with a 
hand grenade after being surrounded by police but an official 
coroners report said rodriguez gacha and the other men died from 
bullet wounds to the head and body 
rodriguez gacha was the second most important leader of the 
medellin cartel which together with a rival group from the 
southern city of cali is responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine 
sold on us streets 
the other cartel leaders are escobar and jorge luis ochoa 
rodriguez gacha was perhaps the most ruthless of the three 
authorities blamed the billionaire trafficker for hundreds of 
deaths of political leaders judges journalists and farmers 
maza the investigative police chief accused him of contracting 
the aug 18 killing of luis carlos galan a leading presidential 
candidate whose killing provoked the latest government crackdown

a british newspaper reported sunday that police 
have enough evidence to charge several suspects in the bombing of 
pan am flight 103 a year ago 
the sunday times of london said scottish investigators told a 
secret fivenation meeting of security services that under scottish 
law charges are now possible against certain persons 
the weekly did not say when the meeting took place identify the 
source of information for its story or give further details about 
the number or identities of the alleged suspects 
it said leaders of security services in britain west germany 
the united states sweden and malta attended the meeting in 
meckenheim west germany 
the sunday times said police heading the investigation told the 
meeting that because of extradition obstacles some suspects might 
have to be tried abroad 
new yorkbound flight 103 originated in frankfurt west germany 
changed planes in london and was blown up over lockerbie scotland 
killing all 259 people on board and 11 on the ground 
lord frazer scotlands senior law officer on friday announced 
results of the first public inquiry into the bombing but said 
criminal proceedings were not imminent 
he said ahmed jibrils popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command a radical palestinian organization was 
among groups under investigation jibril has denied any involvement 
the sunday times said police have for some time suspected who 
the killers are but the painstaking assembly of evidence has been 
a long task 
it added police probably will wait until their inquiries are 
completed in three or four months before starting criminal 
proceedings 
frazer in an interview published in the edinburgh weekly 
scotland on sunday said any trial in the case almost certainly 
would take place in the united states 
frazer scotlands lord advocate told the newspaper that 
scotland would not compete with the united states to extradite 
suspects held in other countries the paper reported he said 
scotland would arrange a trial only if a country holding a suspect 
refused a us extradition request because the united states has 
the death penalty 
if on the other hand the united states was in that position 
to secure extradition when the united kingdom couldnt i want 
these people brought to justice and i wouldnt stand in the way of 
anything he was quoted as saying

controversies linked to his enormous wealth and jetset lifestyle 
in 1987 the us supreme court rejected alfassis appeal of a 
more than 77 million divorce settlement two years earlier 
alfassis former neighbors in beverly hills hoisted glasses of 
champagne as a demolition crew leveled a the sheiks fireravaged 
mansion which had featured fleshtone nude statues with 
redpainted genitalia 
dozens of cats now roam outside alfassis miami beach mansion 
following his recent decision to set aside 25 million to save the

and picture mommy dead

native land and push for democratic reforms there similar to those 
in eastern europe 
we do not have a democracy in saudi arabia and there are many 
problems we want to instruct people about the royal family and 
what theyve done to the country alfassi said

president bush on saturday signalled 
that his administration is ready to consider a major relaxation of 
trade restrictions on hightechnology exports to warsaw pact 
nations 
i think it is timely that we take a new look at the commercial 
restraints bush said at a joint news conference on this 
caribbean island after meeting with french president francois 
mitterrand 
bush made the comments when asked if he was willing to consider 
relaxing the longstanding trade restraints in light of the recent 
democratic movements sweeping eastern europe 
senior administration officials speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said that the united states is willing to give a full 
reevaluation to eastwest trade curbs that have multiplied over 
the past 40 years 
the reevaluation mentioned by bush would seek to separate items 
that had real potential military applications from commercial items 
that provide little realistic national security threat the 
officials said 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher has been in the forefront of 
the move to relax the trade restraints 
although these restrictions were designed to keep materials that 
could have military application from finding their way to soviet 
bloc nations critics contend they also impede shipment of hundreds 
of consumer products ranging from home computers to even some 
kitchen appliances that contain sophisticated electronic 
components 
european allies including france have been urging a relaxation 
in these restrictions for some time in part because east bloc 
nations have been able to freely buy the same goods from other 
nations particularly from asian competitors 
but the united states in the past has resisted any major 
revamping of the system 
and even saturday bush told reporters there are still 
legitimate national security interests that must be preserved and i 
dont think we have one iota of difference with france on that 
the set of trade rules of what can be imported into warsaw pact 
nations from the west is regulated by the parisbased coordinating 
committee for multilateral export controls or cocom for short 
this committee is made up of the united states its nato allies 
and japan 
bushs comments saturday were the first public sign that the 
united states is now willing to consider a major relaxation of the 
trade restrictions 
it previously granted mostfavored nation status to hungary 
supported a variety of economic incentives for poland and agreed to 
support the soviet unions longstanding application to participate 
as an observer in an international trade forum the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade

actor lee van cleef whose steely eyes and 
hawklike features won him a long career portraying archvillains in 
western movies died early saturday apparently of a heart attack 
authorities said he was 64 
van cleefs film break came when he was cast as one of four 
desperadoes faced down by gary cooper in the 1952 movie high 
noon he became a familiar gunslinger in socalled spaghetti 
westerns made by italian director sergio leone including the 
good the bad and the ugly 
among his hundreds of blackhat roles were parts in how the 
west was won the man who shot liberty valance and death 
rides a horse 
van cleef collapsed at his oxnard home around 1140 pm friday 
night said craig stevens a ventura county deputy coroner the 
coastal community is about 60 miles north of los angeles 
the actors wife barbara called paramedics and he was taken to 
st johns regional medical center in oxnard where he was 
pronounced dead at 1204 am stevens said 
its an apparent heart attack stevens said hes got a 
history of heart disease he had a permanent pacemaker 
in 1969 van cleef jokingly attributed his gunslinger casting in 
some 350 television movies and motion pictures to his predators 
nose 
i didnt speak a word in high noon he recalled in 1951 
stanley and earl kramer saw me in a play mr roberts and 
offered me the role eventually played by lloyd bridges in the film 
providing i would have my nose fixed i refused and wound up as one 
of the four villains 
nowpeople remember this beak he said 
born in 1925 of dutch ancestry in somerville nj van cleef 
dropped out of high school to join the navy where he served on 
submarine chasers and minesweepers he was discharged in 1946 
he worked several odd jobs as a farmer gas station attendant 
and painter before getting his first stage role in a production of 
our town by an amateur troupe in clinton nj 
new york producer and director harold anderson noticed van cleef 
in an amateur production of heaven can wait and helped find 
him a place in the road company production of the world war ii navy

before making his first film appearance in high noon 
his film career had stalled when he was recruited by leone to 
play in the 1965 western for a few dollars more starring 
clint eastwood as the man with no name 
van cleef changed hats for his role in the film playing what he 
called a nonangelic sort of character whos still on the side of 
the law 
in the followup film the good the bad and the ugly 
however van cleef returned to his villainous roots playing 
opposite eastwood and eli wallach he also appeared in the 
sciencefiction thriller escape from new york 
van cleefs extended work in italy and europe may have hurt his 
career said his agent tom jennings 
i think he could have been a greater movie star as big as 
charles bronson or clint eastwood had he come back from europe 
sooner than he did but he liked working abroad jennings said 
he wasnt the ambitious killertype star always going after the 
gold ring he did his own thing

as they try to sort out the outlook for 
investing and the economy in the 1990s wall street analysts have 
grown increasingly edgy in recent days about the national real 
estate market 
some of the concern surfaces in generalities for instance 
about the possibility that the long boom in residential real estate 
dating back into the 1960s might have peaked 
but it has also manifested itself in stockmarket specifics 
shares of many regional banks with big commitments to real estate 
loans and of the large national home mortgage companies have been 
falling sharply or at least lagging conspicuously of late 
it seems that regional banks are in the headlines as 
frequently as the big money center institutions recently says 
the value line investment survey in a justpublished report on the 
banking outlook 
the reason is that problems with real estate loans are 
surfacing particularly in the northeast southeast and southwest 
cities as distant and different as boston and phoenix fell 
victim to euphoria with regard to population and business growth in 
the 80s says value line analyst theresa brophy 
on the real estate front were not sure that the worst is 
over slower economic growth in the year ahead might cause other 
markets to weaken 
of course the national real estate market is really made up 
of many diverse local markets where conditions vary dramatically 
in the southwestern oil patch real estate suffered a 
wellpublicized bust in the 1980s even as prices of properties in 
some other parts of the country kept climbing 
through the industrial and agricultural midwest as well 
property values suffered from adverse economic conditions 
in some of those areas speculation now focuses on the chances 
for a rebound from depressed levels 
but an overall slowdown of late in the rise of real estate 
prices has nevertheless stirred worries among analysts who have 
been wondering what debt problems might arise in any kind of 
national business slump 
those concerns intensified on friday when the bank of new 
england in boston announced increases in its loanloss reserve and 
nonperforming assets and said it would report a substantial loss 
for the year 
an accompanying drop in stock prices overall friday left the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials at 273955 up 811 from the week 
before 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 53 at 19345 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market down 1238 at 44384 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 55 at 19347 
volume on the big board averaged 18554 million shares a day 
against 15155 million the week before 
many optimists on the economic outlook pin their hopes on 
declining interest rates to support the real estate market by 
lowering mortgage rates for buyers and allowing at least some 
existing homeowners to refinance at lower costs 
the federal reserve is not confronted with a sharply declining 
economy said richard rippe at dean witter reynolds inc but 
there are no grounds for complacency either 
the weakening signs are very clear and they do imply a risk of 
recession rippe maintained 
with wage and industrial price pressures moderate inflation 
should not be a major obstacle consequently we expect further 
moves toward ease over the next few months the federal reserve 
will want some additional insurance against the cumulation of 
downward pressures

lee iacocca t boone pickens and robert campeau 
swaggered triumphantly through most the 1980s admired feared and 
envied for their business brilliance wealth and foresight 
but the baying bloodhounds of economic reality treed them this 
past week the latest examples of how a weakening economy borrowed 
money and strategic blunders have humbled some of the decades 
biggest financial celebrities 
iacocca the chrysler corp chairman who led the rescue of the 
no 3 automaker from failure in the late 1970s once was hailed as 
a national hero when he announced early repayment of government 
bailout loans in 1983 iacocca boasted we at chrysler borrow 
money the old fashioned way we pay it back 
but over the past several months chryslers financial 
performance has deteriorated sharply and forced the company into a 
severe retreat because of brutal competition and the declining 
demand for cars and trucks 
in july iacocca proclaimed a 1 billion costcutting program 
earlier this month he scrapped a diversification plan and 
announced plans to sell chryslers aerospace division to raise more 
money 
this past week chrysler announced big rebates to unload 
backlogs of cars and trucks but the most telling element of the 
strategy was its firstever rebates on minivans formerly one of 
the automakers most popular sellers capturing more than half the 
market now chrysler is fighting to hold even part of that in the 
face of rivals from ford motor co general motors corp and japan 
for pickens the takeover strategist who epitomized the 1980s 
corporate raider and often denounced target companies for 
mismanagement this past week offered what critics called a 
sobering lesson in how he mismanaged his own 
the mesa limited partnership pickens energy company 
eliminated cash distributions to its unit holders the equivalent 
of eliminating dividend payments to shareholders and announced 
asset sales to repay debts including an interest in its prized 
kansas natural gas field 
pickens said the steps were necessary because of an unexpectedly 
prolonged depression in the price of natural gas mesas most 
important source of earnings 
but it was considered an ironic retreat by an outspoken defender 
of shareholder rights pickens had been borrowing money and using 
profits from his own takeover forays to maintain the cash 
distributions to mesas constituents 
for campeau whose multibillion dollar string of debtfinanced 
takeovers gave him an enormous retailing empire the past week was 
a christmas reminder that theres no santa claus when creditors 
call 
the canadian investor forced to put his crown jewel 
bloomingdales stores up for sale in september because of trouble 
repaying debts disclosed that he was having even more trouble 
despite an emergency cash infusion from lenders 
the announcement seemed to suggest that even the crucial holiday 
selling season might not tide over many of campeaus cashstarved 
stores it jolted the already weak market for highyield junk bond 
debt that campeau and other big takeover investors have sold to 
finance their expansions in the 1980s 
it also raised the prospect that campeau might put part of his 
holdings under bankruptcy court protection from creditors and by 
the end of the week that possibility seemed more like a 
selffulfilling prophecy 
heller financial inc one of the nations biggest lenders in 
the retailing industry said it no longer would extend credit to 
suppliers of campeaus stores 
in other business and economic news this past week 
chrysler wasnt the only automaker facing problems all of the 
big three and several foreign competitors announced slow us sales 
and some suggested they would have to idle thousands of workers 
unless orders picked up the sluggishness spread to europe where 
swedens troubled saabscania ab said it would sell a half interest 
in its passenger carbuilding business to gm 
most government statistics suggested much slower economic 
growth giving the federal reserve more flexibility to lower 
interest rates industrial production barely grew in november 
wholesale prices fell business inventories expanded in october and 
sales fell but the trade deficit for october surged nearly 20 
percent from a month earlier suggesting that americas appetite 
for foreign goods remains unabated 
prosecutors notched another courtroom victory in the ivan 
boesky insider trading scandal showing that juries increasingly 
are willing to convict wealthy defendants in complex securities 
fraud cases gaf corp and its vice chairman james t sherwin were 
found guilty of stock manipulation
