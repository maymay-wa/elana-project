the board of directors of the associated press 
approved unanimously a 1989 general assessment increase of 44 
percent for newspaper and broadcast members 
the increase takes effect jan 15 1989 for aps 1463 
newspaper and 5700 broadcast members 
william j keating ap board chairman and chief executive 
officer of the detroit newspaper agency noted that the increase 
was below inflation estimates of 5 percent to 55 percent for next 
year 
the increase continues the recent trend of assessment 
adjustments less than the general rate of inflation he said 
tuesday 
keating said stringent cost controls and new revenues from 
nonmember sources enabled the board to restrict the increase to 
44 percent and still fund major service improvements now under way 
keating said the aps proposed operating and capital budgets 
were examined by the board on a detailed linebyline basis 
the budgets provide for expansion of aps news staff mostly in 
the united states to help meet the needs of aps 28 percent 
increase in newspaper membership over the past five years keating 
said 
the budgets also provide support for the new highspeed 
photostream and graphicsnet systems as well as for total 
replacement of editing systems in all domestic bureaus 
the general assessment increase will be combined with the fifth 
step of the phasein of the circulationbased newspaper formula for 
those not yet on card with the new formula which was adopted in 
1985 changes in circulation will also be reflected in the new 
assessment for each newspaper member 
each member will receive exact figures on the assessment change 
in october keating said

mayor kurt schmoke removed the baltimore school 
board president on tuesday after he admitted lying to board members 
as a way of finding out who leaks stories to the media 
meldon s hollis who was appointed by the mayor to a oneyear 
term as board president in december will remain on the board the 
mayor appoints the nine board members who serve as volunteers 
hollis an attorney admitted earlier tuesday that he used poor 
judgment in planting three different versions of a story to track 
down news leaks and said that he would resign if the mayor asked 
him to 
whether or not i retain the public confidence is a 
matter for the public to decide for the mayor to decide and for 
the school board to decide hollis said at a news conference 
tuesday afternoon 
schmoke called hollis actions a terrible mistake in 
judgment 
my view is that the public can tolerate an official being 
wrong on an issue schmoke said what people generally find 
intolerable is an official lying to them 
tape recordings of holliss remarks monday to the foundation for 
community unity in service a political club show he said he 
leaked false information to school board members to see if they 
were lying to me 
i know whos doing the lying he said in the speech i 
know who it is i feed them the lies then they run out and lie to 
the press 
hollis said tuesday he could not recall using the word lie 
in describing the way he released information on how candidates for 
school superintendent would be interviewed earlier this year 
he said he believed leaks were undermining the selection 
process because some candidates threatened to withdraw if their 
candidacies were made public 
he said he had become a political target and the object of news 
leaks because of his attempts to uncover favoritism in the awarding 
of grants in the school system 
board member edward j gutman said tuesday that he was 
bewildered by hollis remarks 
i think theres something wrong with the man i dont even 
know what hes talking about gutman said the whole thing is 
getting uglier and uglier we are trustees with the most 
important responsibility in the city 
some board members hollis said walk out of meetings and tell 
you we have a deal and then before i can get to my office the press 
is calling me asking me did you all decide so and so 
i know who they are i know who is doing the leaking i know 
who is doing the lying thats ok it will be taken care of in 
time hollis said 
hollis acknowledged dissension within the board however he 
took issue with an article in mondays editions of the baltimore 
sun which said the school board was in a revolt 
problems arose last spring between hollis and board members when 
they were prevented from participating in the selection of a new 
school superintendent problems resurfaced in july when hollis 
decided to hire a new executive director and several board members 
said they felt the full board should have voted on the post

a new law prompted by 
larry moores slithering squeaking menagerie is forcing him to get 
rid of 146 of his snakes 
responding to neighbors complaints about living next door to a 
house filled with 150 snakes and several hundred rats and mice 
needed to feed them the municipal council voted monday to limit 
to four the number of snakes or rodents in a household 
they dont belong in a residential neighborhood in an urban 
setting 150 of anything is too much said alderman john keryluk 
i wouldnt want to live next door to a house where i know there 
are snakes or rodents in large numbers 
keryluk cochairman of the council committee that proposed the 
bylaw amendment said moore keeps his reptiles and rodents in cages 
the concern in the neighborhood is about the rodents or the 
snakes breaking loose he said what if an uncaring person were 
to break into his house and kick some of the cages apart 
alf miller who lives across the street from moore said he 
complained about the snakes 2 years ago after he found one in his 
yard 
it was over 6 feet long and had a head about the size of an 
orange miller said it was sunning itself half on the wall of 
my patio and half on the ground 
moore has a large variety of snakes but keryluk said he 
believes none is venomous 
moore did not return messages left on his home answering machine 
the amendment to the animal regulation bylaw which excludes pet 
stores and schools also prohibits venomous snakes

graeber and others hook pilots and engineers to monitors while 
they fly they hope to see whether crew members make more mistakes 
when such physical signs as body temperature and heartbeat suggest 
they are less alert 
much of that data is still being collected and analyzed but 
graeber said its clear that by the third night of such schedules 
as the san franciscolondonseattle tour the cockpit crew becomes 
increasingly lethargic 
dr mary carskadon of brown university has shown in the 
laboratory what graeber sees in the cockpit the effects of lost 
sleep accumulate over time 
most people particularly those who are trained as pilots are 
can cope with the effects of chronic sleep deprivation fairly well 
most of the time she said but a vulnerability is set up 
that puts them at risk for catastrophic events to occur 
experts say that when people are tired they become sloppy 
motivation flags inertia sets in they take shortcuts and ignore 
small details 
flying a big plane however is mostly a matter of paying 
attention to small details setting instruments following 
checklists getting weather reports watching dials 
its the errors of omission that occur because of lapses in 
attention that are the hallmark of fatiguerelated accidents 
said dr charles czeisler of harvard medical school such omissions 
would include not noticing an indicator thats not right 
anticipating a problem before it occurs thinking many steps down 
the line he said 
sometimes pilots and flight engineers fall asleep on long 
cruises especially over oceans this is not terribly dangerous as 
long as someone in the cockpit stays awake but sleep is 
contagious the sleep experts say their research has turned up many 
tales of entire crews nodding off 
another concern is microsleep a shadowy state in which people 
are half asleep with the brain waves of sleep intruding on those 
of wakefulness people in this condition can continue to perform 
duties while only vaguely aware of whats going on around them 
its much worse than being frankly fully asleep because 
they can continue to carry out routine tasks said czeisler if 
they were truly asleep someone else at least might notice 
these problems occur in part because jet travel ignores the 
circadian timekeeper the product of millions of years of evolution 
on a planet rotating once each 24 hours each day the clock 
oversees a symphony of changes in body temperature alertness and 
hormonal secretions all of them geared to roughly a 24hour cycle 
for most people the daily swing reaches its low point from 330 
to 5 am this is when they are sleepiest there is another less 
pronounced valley of drowsiness in the afternoon from 4 to 5 the 
body temperature is also lowest at these times 
consider the pilot who leaves california on a latenight 
crosscountry flight even if he slept during the day hes likely 
to feel sleepy early in the morning as his body temperature falls 
by the time he checks into a new york hotel his body temperature 
is rising again his body clock is telling him to wake up even 
though he is tired sleep is difficult he awakens feeling ragged 
and has to fly again 
the pilot who flies across multiple time zones faces the 
problem that his body continues at the old time zone said 
dinges he is forced to try to sleep when his body clock wants 
him to be awake and to be awake when his body clock wants him to 
sleep

a lawyer for edwin meese iii says the former 
attorney generals reputation has been impugned unfairly by a 
government ethics office memorandum on meese that declares that 
simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the mark of public 
service 
ethics office director frank nebeker said monday that meese 
failed to meet federal ethics requirements by hanging onto 14000 
in telephone stock and by assisting longtime friend e robert 
wallach 
nebekers based his memo on the results of a criminal 
investigation completed this summer by independent counsel james 
mckay although mckay declined to prosecute meese he concluded 
that meese probably broke federal conflictofinterest laws twice 
by handling matters affecting the telecommunications industry at 
the time he held the phone stock 
meese declared he had been vindicated because he had not been 
prosecuted 
but nebeker said a major purpose of this memorandum is to 
remind and inform that simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the 
mark of public service 
the critique was sent to ethics officers in the federal 
government 
james rocap a lawyer for meese said in a statement we are 
dismayed by nebekers memo that meeses integrity and 
reputation have been unfairly impugned 
rocap said nebeker apparently read the mckay report but not 
the rebuttal to it filed by meeses lawyers in it they said 
meeses behavior had met the highest ethical standards 
rocap also said nebeker had rejected a request to meet with 
meeses attorneys 
a letter last wednesday from nebeker to meeses lawyers said the 
findings would be based on undisputed facts and that the 
request for a meeting was therefore being denied 
nebeker said meese also may have violated a presidential 
executive order on ethics and accompanying regulations a question 
under review by the justice departments office of public 
responsibility 
the executive order says federal employees should avoid any 
action which might create the appearance of among other things 
using public office for private gain giving preferential treatment 
or adversely affecting the confidence of the public in the 
integrity of government 
there is no more clarion standard than that which exhorts 
an employee to avoid any action that adversely affects the 
confidence of the public in the integrity of the government 
nebeker said while mr meeses personal reputation could not but 
have suffered as a result of this investigation the publics 
confidence in the department of justice has also suffered one need 
only look at the wellpublicized personnel resignations in the 
department to see why this standard is at issue 
concerned over the impact meeses continued tenure was having on 
the justice department former deputy attorney general arnold burns 
and criminal division chief william weld resigned in protest in 
march 
nebeker noted that meese promised in 1985 when he became 
attorney general to sell the phone stock because it presented a 
potential conflict of interest meese listed the stock on 
subsequent financial disclosure forms as having been sold 
in reality meese without informing the senate or the ethics 
office transferred the stock to his financial manager w franklyn 
chinn who is under indictment along with wallach a san francisco 
attorney on charges of racketeering in the wedtech scandal meese 
finally retrieved the stock and sold it last year after he came 
under criminal investigation 
in addition meeses agreement with the ethics office stipulated 
that he would remove himself temporarily from any matter involving 
wallach a longtime friend of the attorney general who had 
represented him in an independent counsels investigation in 1984 
wallach was owed legal fees as a result 
but during the period meese had agreed to recuse himself from 
involvement with matters concerning wallach meese telephoned 
thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane to arrange a 
meeting for wallach in connection with a proposed 1 billion iraqi 
oil pipeline 
this office did not accept mr meeses ethics agreement 
lightly does not accept his failure to comply with it lightly and 
will not accept other nominees agreements lightly in the future 
nebekers memo said these agreements serve an important purpose 
not only for the individual involved but for the public this 
investigation of mr meese is a stark example of the results of 
inattention to such an agreement by an official

todays federal rules for pilot rest and duty hours come out of 
the era of the dc3 when propellerdriven airliners droned along 
at speeds less than 200 mph and took eight hours to fly from new 
york to miami 
revised in 1964 and again in 1985 many of the federal air 
regulations differ little from rules first issued in the 1930s 
crews for large airlines on domestic routes cant be scheduled 
to fly longer than eight hours between required rest periods they 
cant fly more than 30 hours in seven days 100 hours a month and 
1000 hours a year crews may exceed the eighthour limit if their 
scheduled flights are delayed by weather traffic or equipment 
problems 
commuter airline pilots may fly 34 hours in 7 days 120 hours in 
a month and 1200 a year 
crews must be given at least nine hours rest in a 24hour 
period however that can be cut to eight hours if the next rest 
period is increased by two to three hours based on an faa formula 
threemember international crews can fly up to 12 hours a day 
they must get 18 hours rest if they fly more than 24 hours in 72 
hours or 20 hours within 48 hours larger crews can fly longer 
twomember crews can fly only eight hours between rest periods 
however the rules dont speak to duty hours measured from the 
time a pilot reports to the airport usually an hour before first 
takeoff through the days schedule including sitting on the ground 
between flights to departure after the final flight such 
reckoning can stretch a crews time on the job to 16 hours 
west germany britain and the netherlands limit their pilots 
hours by calculating duty time the number of takeoffs and 
landings the time of day and the number of time zones crossed 
none of these factors is considered under us commercial 
regulations 
the latest faa rules are the result of socalled regulation by 
negotiation union and airline representatives met in 198384 
with faa officials and a mediator to work out minor changes in 
domestic rules 
these rules are often used by airlines and their unions as a 
baseline for schedules stricter than government guidelines 
our own rules go on beyond the far federal air 
regulations said george hof head of american airlines flight 
operations we find the far is a place to begin 
faa administrator t allan mcartor strongly denies federal 
regulations run second in safety to union contracts 
our standard is not the thinnest ice you can skate on he 
said 
yet in 1975 an faa investigation of a series of pan american 
crashes in the pacific raised questions about the adequacy of faa 
regulations 
dr stanley mohler then chief of the faas aeromedical 
applications division suggested us regulators look to the 
factors that the europeans use to set flying limits 
it was the feeling at the faa to leave it up to the unions to 
negotiate relative to their airlines specific type of flying 
said mohler now head of aerospace medicine at wright state 
university it seemed to make sense up until deregulation 
with deregulation airlines stretched into new markets added 
new routes and faced new competition efforts to cut costs and keep 
fares low put pressure on various parts of the industry including 
the pilots according to the airline pilots association the 
average pilot flies 13 percent more each month today than 10 years 
ago 
mcartor says he has an open mind to change the faa is 
supporting fatigue research being done by nasa on several airlines 
i dont know of any carrier that wont voluntarily do all they 
can to ensure efficiency in the cockpit he said but i dont 
believe we know all that we will know about this phenomenon as we 
understand it better the scheduling i think will reflect that

a consumer group says it will fight to retain 
federal rules requiring food processors to acknowledge when finely 
ground bone is used in hot dogs sausage and other meat products 
rodney e leonard executive director of community nutrition 
institute decried an agriculture department proposal issued monday 
that would require that such ingredients as ground bone be included 
on package labeling only when the material exceeds 10 percent of 
the meat portion of the finished product 
under current regulations socalled mechanically separated meat 
or msm can comprise up to 20 percent of the meat portion of certain 
products which include hot dogs luncheon meats sausage 
scrapple canned spaghetti with meat sauce and other items but 
labels must state that the product contains msm 
the department said that if the new proposal is adopted msm 
used in meat and poultry products would not have to be listed in 
the ingredients statement on the label as long as it does not 
exceed 10 percent of the meat and poultry portion of the finished 
product 
leonard said the proposed rule change was politically 
motivated by the outgoing reagan administration which he said 
could have made the proposal long ago 
they want to get all of the junk and crud and sleaze done 
before they leave office leonard said he said his 
washingtonbased consumer group would challenge the proposal during 
the usda hearing process 
msm is produced by putting the bones and attached meat remnants 
of a slaughtered animal through a grinder and forcing the mixture 
through sieves although most of the bone is strained out some 
small particles about the size of black pepper flakes wind up 
with the salvaged meat in the final mixture 
mechanically deboned meat has been approved for use in certain 
foods since 1978 however the industry complained that the 
stricter initial regulations called too much attention to the 
finely ground bone and the product failed to gain widespread use 
department officials said the proposal to allow up to 10 percent 
msm in products without labeling reflects a petition submitted to 
usda by four processors bob evans farms inc columbus ohio 
odom sausage co madison tenn sara lee corp memphis tenn 
and owen country sausage inc richardson texas 
the proposed change in regulations will be open for public 
comment until nov 8 those can be sent to policy office attn

an unlikely coalition of wealthy 
housewives and cattlemen is spearheading opposition to mexicos 
first nuclear power plant 
the plant laguna verde has been a pet project of the governing 
institutional revolutionary party for more than 20 years 
but the party which lost ground to the opposition in the july 6 
general election announced soon afterward that it was delaying the 
plants startup 
after july 6 nothing is the same said rebecca labastida a 
founder of the mothers of veracruz antinuclear committee one of 
several groups that have been working to get the plant mothballed 
or converted to nonnuclear fuel 
the coalition of urban housewives and cattle ranchers fighting 
the project includes members of the governing party 
a social consciousness is growing in mexico one point is 
nuclear energy said regional planner tomas berlin who just 
finished a book critical of laguna verde in it you will see a 
new face of mexico 
many residents in xalapa 140 miles east of mexico city oppose 
the plant which is located 40 miles outside the city on a winding 
road dotted with roadside stands laden with local honey cheese and 
fruit 
thick stands of sugar cane carpet the steamy coastal plain where 
white power pylons march down to the gulf of mexico and the green 
lagoon that gave its name to mexicos first nuclear plant 
inside the 13story unit one containment building uranium fuel 
rods wait in a dry concrete pool next to 657megawatt reactor from 
the united states 
the men who are building the plant say they are confident of its 
safety and are ready to turn on the first of two reactors 
the first unit is ready its a political decision now 
project spokesman hector luna lastra said recently 
critics say the reactor made by the usbased general electric 
co and its containment building are dangerous and obsolete 
the william h zimmer plant in ohio which had a reactor of the 
same design is being converted to coal fuel the owners sued 
alleging the reactor design was flawed and won an outofcourt 
settlement of more than 78 millon 
the union of concerned scientists says all similar plants should 
be phased out because the containment building could leak 
radioactive materials 
the nuclear regulatory commission has concluded there is a 90 
percent chance that it the containment building will break if 
there is a meltdown robert pollard a nuclear safety engineer 
said from washington 
laguna verde is all that is left of a grand plan for a 
nationwide network of 20 nuclear plants the idea died when oil 
prices plunged but laguna verde lived on despite a price tag that 
rose from 263 million to 35 billion 
the project was announced in 1968 construction began in 1973 
and for years the project moved quietly along providing thousands 
of jobs 
opposition to laguna verde began in april 1986 after the nuclear 
accident at chernobyl in the soviet union said patricia ortega 
another founder of mothers of veracruz the explosion and fire at 
the soviet plant killed 31 people and sent a cloud of radiation 
around the world 
the federal electricity commission countered criticism of 
lagunda verde with a public relations campaign but the opposition 
kept growing 
mothers of veracruz turned a group of traditional mexican 
housewives into a feisty band of activists that sent telegrams to 
public officials organized phone banks and printed booklets about 
nuclear energy 
waking people up waking people up thats been the hardest 
thing to make them realize you can do something mrs labastida 
said 
local cattlemen joined in some even offering to help pay to 
turn laguna verde into a nonnuclear plant last year cattlemen 
and housewives blocked traffic by linking arms across the road 
leading to the plant 
the plant has two reactors one ready to be started up the 
governing party didnt say how long it would delay that procedure

the united states should develop new proposals 
for ussoviet conventional arms control talks in case soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev succeeds in cutting back on military 
spending says a key congressman 
the plans should be prepared even though theres no indication 
gorbachev has yet been successful said rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee 
a central element of gorbachevs new thinking is that the 
western threat can be reduced by political means that is arms 
control which then reduces soviet defense requirements the 
report said 
for gorbachev arms control can cut the size of the western 
threat and a revised military doctrine can scale back the 
militarys response to that threat it said 
the panels defense policy subcommittee concluded monday that 
to date there have been no significant identifiable changes 
traceable to gorbachevs drive to scale back defense spending 
the study by the democraticrun panel was based on a series of 
hearings including testimony from the cia defense intelligence 
agency and other experts in government and private industry 
republican members of the panel issued a dissent disputing the 
majoritys implication that the soviets may be moving away from 
what the gop legislators said is a drive to achieve nuclear 
superiority over the west 
gorbachev has called for economic and military reforms aimed at 
shifting more spending into consumer goods and away from the huge 
soviet military structure aspin noted 
gorbachevs reform agenda for the military is driven primarily 
by domestic concerns not military or strategic factors the 
study said the equation is simple in order for his economic 
reforms to succeed gorbachev must shift resources from the defense 
sector to civilian use 
the current fiveyear plan began in 1986 and was developed 
before gorbachev took power in march 1985 aspin said at a news 
conference some changes may be seen in the soviets next fiveyear 
plan he said 
there is a growing consensus among the experts that gorbachev 
intends to shift some of the soviet unions economic capacity from 
military to civilian use said aspin 
what the united states ought to be doing is probing we 
should move cautiously and carefully but we should move he 
said we need some concrete proposals in conventional arms 
he was referring to the longstalled talks aimed at reducing 
nonnuclear weapons and troops in europe 
the upcoming year were looking at is a critical year aspin 
said its too bad the united states is in transition 
as the reagan administration winds down no new proposals are 
likely in addition a new administration will take six to eight 
months to prepare its plans no matter whether republican george 
bush or democrat michael dukakis is elected president aspin said 
us officials have a difficult time estimating soviet military 
spending since the soviets dont publish details about their 
programs 
the soviets appear to be spending about 18 percent of their 
gross national product on defense compared to about 6 percent for 
the united states the study said but the us gnp is much larger 
soviet military spending increased about 2 percent annually in 
the decade before gorbachev took power and has increased about 3 
percent in each of the past two years 
the study cited the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf 
treaty which includes strict verification procedures and bigger 
cuts in the soviet arsenal than in the us stockpile of weapons 
the gop minority led by rep william dickinson rala the 
ranking republican on the committee criticized part of the report 
this report accepts without the slightest qualification the 
idea that the soviet leadership has accepted the implications of 
nuclear parity implicitly meaning that the soviets reject the 
concepts of superiority preemption first use and victory the 
gop members said 
the apparent justification underlying this assumption appears 
to be a decade of both soviet public statements and arms control 
activities however neither can be taken at face value as evidence 
of a meaningful transformation in soviet nuclear doctrine the 
dissent said

for the past two weeks the 
15000 people of this town have been living in flood waters 
they say they have received almost no help from the government 
although the town is only 25 miles east of dhaka the capital 
even in normal times banchharampur is isolated like thousands 
of other towns and villages in this country that is now 
threequarters submerged by overflowing rivers 
there are no roads connecting the town to the outside world the 
trip from dhaka takes five hours by motorboat across winding rivers 
and through inundated rice paddies 
most people in banchharampur are weavers or landless farmers who 
have not been able to work since the flood waters from the titash 
river reached their houses aug 29 
firoz who delivers goods from the market when it isnt flooded 
and his wife hana said they tried to get medical help for their 
7yearold daughter rahima who had a fever 
government medical workers came here once but the crowd was 
too big and they left before we could see them firoz said 
townspeople said eight people drowned or died of diarrhea or 
dysentery caused by drinking contaminated water he said his family 
had received 44 pounds of free rie from the government and had to 
borrow money from other villagers to buy more a grain seller named 
farid said he had only two baskets of lowquality rice to sell 
the government and foreign relief agencies are struggling to 
reach millions of marooned flood victims by helicopter and boat 
but with at least 65000 villages spread across 55000 square miles 
an area the size of wisconsin the task is slow 
on sunday fresh vegetables reached banchharampur by boat from 
unsubmerged fields 12 miles away but the prices had soared by as 
much as 175 percent since the floods began june 13 
sattar his wife alia and their three children normally eat 44 
pounds of rice a day since the flood the family has been getting 
by on 22 pounds or less of rice a day alia said she uncovered a 
tin cooking pot displaying an inch of rice in the bottom 
this is all we have left we have no more money she said 
speaking in bengali through an interpreter 
the family has purchased rice with sattars last earnings as a 
porter and money from the familys only salable item a chicken 
alia managed to save when they abandoned their straw house where 
the flood water has reached the roof 
we stayed in our house until the water got as high as 
saliha alia said drawing her oldest child close to her 
saliha wearing only a pair of cotton shorts and a jewelry stud 
in her nostril stood about three feet tall alia who like many 
bangladeshis doesnt have a family name said she did not know her 
daughters age but the girl appeared to be about 10 
alia said her family took refuge with 20 other people in one 
room of a hostel built for college students where the water was 18 
inches deep the families piled wooden benches on top of each other 
in two tiers creating a wobbly wooden platform above the water 
the highest path through the village is a foot under water some 
people are living in houses where women wade waistdeep in water to 
cook food on boards propped just above the water 
but life in the village went on the governmentrun bank was 
open although the few customers stood ankledeep in water at the 
deed registry office clerks sat on platforms above the water with 
a black goat tethered in their midst

in the capitol hill office for new yorks 19th 
congressional district phones still ring mail comes in letters 
go out 
the only thing missing is a member of congress 
until aug 5 the district was represented by rep mario biaggi 
a democrat who for nearly 20 years represented the east bronx and 
part of yonkers biaggi who was convicted of racketeering last 
month in the wedtech trial resigned rather than face almost 
certain expulsion by his colleagues 
but even without an elected representative the work of the 
congressional office goes on house rules provide for keeping 
offices running in the event that a member resigns dies or is 
expelled 
constituents still get some services what they dont get is 
their own advocate who can sponsor and vote on legislation and 
perform work in committees 
in the case of biaggis constituents they lost their voice in 
congress last year when biaggi agreed to stop voting on the house 
floor after being indicted for accepting illegal paid vacations he 
later was convicted of that charge in a separate trial 
deputy clerk w raymond colley said that when a vacancy occurs 
in the house the clerk of the house becomes in effect the 
supervisor or manager of the vacant offices until a successor is 
elected 
the clerk usually selects one of the former house members 
senior staffers to run the office colley said robert blancato 
biaggis longtime administrative assistant was appointed to run 
the office upon the congressmans departure 
we are carrying on the way that not only mario biaggi would 
expect of his staff and the years of experience that we have but 
also using our own standards of what we believe we should do 
blancato said 
blancato said he still talks daily to biaggi who has returned 
to the bronx and that the business of the congressional office 
inevitably comes up 
i dont know if there are rules about discussing business 
blancato said his advice and guidance and counsel do i 
still need it for what i do everyday absolutely sure 
colley said such communications are to be expected and voiced 
confidence that blancato understands his role and what hes 
doing 
blancato said he has no sense of role reversal during 
conversations with biaggi 
every time i speak to him in a philosophical way even if 
it isnt in a literal way im stll speaking to my boss he said 
even the hurdle of sponsoring legislation is not insurmountable 
without an elected representative if the appointed administrator 
believes some problem requires legislation he can talk to the 
other members of the delegation from that particular state and ask 
them to support the issue colley said 
these are not unusual situations colley said we have had 
vacancies for various reasons over the years 
ten seats including one belonging to the delegate from american 
samoa have been vacated since the 100th congress began almost two 
years ago colley said most of those seats have been filled 
through special elections 
new york gov mario cuomo has called no special election to fill 
biaggis seat so whoever is elected on nov 8 wont begin serving 
until january 1989 
chances are good that biaggi will be reelected to the seat he 
vacated but he has said he would not serve if he wins it is 
expected that he would quit again and a special election would be 
held

the huge losses to 1988 harvests came mostly 
in june and july when drought and searing heat shriveled corn and 
soybean yields across much of the nation new agriculture 
department estimates show 
assistant secretary ewen m wilson the departments chief 
economist said total grain production this year is expected to 
drop to 191 million metric tons down 31 percent from 1987 
total supplies of grain for 198889 which include inventories 
at the beginning of the season are forecast at 366 million tons 
down 24 percent from last year 
wilson said at a news conference monday that crop development 
now has progressed to the point where production can be forecast 
with a reasonable degree of confidence 
the corn yield for example was estimated at 785 bushels per 
harvested acre down from 1194 bushels last year the largest 
droughtinduced reduction in yield on record he said 
from 1965 to 1987 the september estimate overstated corn 
production on nine occasions and understated it on 14 occasions 
wilson said in the case of soybeans the september estimate 
overshot final production in 12 years and understated it in 11 
wilson said rainfall in the last month has improved the 
conditions of pastures and ranges although more precipitation is 
needed to restore them to normal 
wilson said he is holding to an earlier prediction that consumer 
food prices will go up an average of 3 percent to 5 percent this 
year with about 1 percent of the rise caused by drought a further 
increase is expected in 1989 
the new usda estimates showed the corn harvest which is under 
way is expected to be at a fiveyear low of 446 billion bushels 
down 37 percent from 706 billion bushels harvested in 1987 even 
so that was down by less than 1 percent from the forecast a month 
ago 
in may and june before the drought tightened its grip usda 
projected the corn harvest at 73 billion bushels based on trends 
and an assumption of normal weather 
those projections were revised downward in july to 52 billion 
bushels assuming farmers got normal weather the remainder of the 
season in august the forecast was lowered to 448 billion 
bushels the smallest harvest since 1983 when drought and federal 
acreage curbs reduced output to 417 billion bushels 
the soybean harvest was estimated at a 12year low of 147 
billion bushels down 23 percent from 19 billion bushels produced 
last year but virtually unchanged from the august forecast 
estimates last spring called for about 188 billion bushels and 
the july projection was 165 billion bushels 
production of all wheat was projected at 181 billion bushels 
down 14 percent from 21 billion produced in 1987 and 1 percent 
below the august forecast 
in may and june usda forecast this years wheat output would be 
up slightly the july projection was 184 billion bushels and the 
august forecast was 182 billion bushels 
corn is the largest and most important crop grown by american 
farmers and as a feed ingredient is essential to the production 
of meat poultry and dairy products 
soybeans which provide highprotein meal and quality vegetable 
oil used in food processing also are vital to us food production 
no new estimate of winter wheat production was included last 
months forecast which was carried forward into the september 
report was 155 billion bushels down 1 percent from last year 
new estimates for spring planted wheat included durum 492 
million bushels down 47 percent from 1987 production and the 
smallest harvest since 1961 the new estimate was also down 10 
percent from august 
other spring wheat was estimated at 206 million bushels down 54 
percent from last year and 3 percent below the august forecast 
cotton production was estimated at 147 million bales down 2 
percent from august but only slightly below the 1987 crop the crop 
was projected at 137 million bales in july 
overall the departments agricultural statistics board said 
us crop production this year is expected to drop to 88 percent of 
a 1977 base used as a comparison that would be the lowest since 
1983 
crop production last year averaged 106 percent of the base year 
the record was 117 percent reached in 1985 1982 and 1981

the defense department is pursuing the 
development of nuclear warheads that would penetrate the earth 
before detonating and which could be a more effective weapon 
against soviet underground command centers 
pentagon officials said monday that defense secretary frank c 
carlucci had authorized development of the socalled burrowing 
nukes that have been under study for years 
military scientists are convinced they would be far more 
powerful against underground bunkers than other nuclear devices 
that explode on the surface even if they dont pack the same 
explosive power 
the new weapon which is highly classified and the 
responsibility of the air force is formally known as an earth 
penetrator 
the energy department disclosed in june 1987 it had begun 
preliminary development work on the warhead needed for a burrowing 
missile because it expected the pentagon to request one 
according to a defense department spokeswoman and other pentagon 
sources that request now has been formally made the energy 
department will be expected to step up its work on warhead design 
while the air force pursues missile development and integration 
work 
spokeswoman jan bodyani said the pentagons defense acquisition 
board last month recommended approval of an air force statement on 
the need for the weapon and carlucci subsequently approved it 
she said the final authorization was dated aug 19 and 
approves this program as a new start she would not discuss 
program details such as funding and anticipated deployment 
schedules 
another pentagon official who insisted on anonymity said 
carlucci had directed the air force to provide cost estimates and 
predicted performance data for a more rudimentary version of the 
weapon that could be produced by modifying an existing missile or 
bomb 
there will almost certainly be an interim earth penetrator 
this official said but the authorization clears the way for the 
broadbased research needed to produce a brand new weapon 
the reagan administration recently has begun spotlighting soviet 
construction of underground bunkers saying it appears the russians 
are convinced they can protect their leaders while waging a nuclear 
war 
earlier this spring the defense department reported in its 
latest edition of the publication soviet military power that 
such construction had been under way for 40 years and the bunkers 
could accommodate thousands of people 
a burrowing warhead would not have to penetrate more than a few 
feet before posing an increased threat to a bunker but its not 
easy to develop a warhead that can withstand the shock of 
striking and burrowing through the ground one official said

the viewing area from which reporters and 
spectators have watched 25 space shuttle launches at the kennedy 
space center will be offlimits to most onlookers when shuttles 
start flying again because of safety concerns officials say 
the air force and nasa on monday announced the new precautions 
at the cape canaveral fla space facility citing studies that 
have shown that the danger to persons on the ground is much 
greater than was understood should an accident occur 
the restrictions cover the viewing area that overlooks launch 
complex 39 where space shuttle discovery is being prepared for 
space 
a press viewing area 35 miles from the launch pads has been 
used by media representatives since the shuttle program began 
invited guests including astronauts families watched from a 
nearby vip area and kennedy space center workers and their 
families also were able to watch from certain areas 
under the new plans most nearby areas will be cleared just 
before and during the launch details of the plans were to be 
explained at a briefing today at the washington headquarters of the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
the plan drew protests monday from rep bill nelson rfla who 
said at the kennedy space center that the house committee on 
science space and technology had argued against such a change in a 
letter sent friday to president reagan 
i dont think an iron curtain should be placed about the 
kennedy space center when were getting back into space said 
nelson a member of the committee and chairman of its subcommittee 
on space science and applications 
the press has been very much a part of the manned space flight 
program for 29 years and to arbitrarily say that some of that press 
has to be excluded is not right nelson said 
nasa officials said the new rules were developed after studies 
of the challenger explosion in january 1986 and the loss of an air 
force titan 34d the following april 
air force range safety officers monitor each launch and have the 
responsibility of blowing up any rocket that strays out of control 
during the challenger accident the solidfueled rocket booster 
engines broke away and were destroyed by the air force range safety 
officer a study of this accident and of the titan 34d loss gave 
new understanding of the dangers to people near the launch pad the 
announcement said 
under certain conditions a solid rocket booster released from 
the vehicle as a result of an accident would follow an unknown 
ballistic trajectory rather than begin to tumble on course as had 
been previously thought the announcement said 
also the statement said it was learned that if outofcontrol 
boosters had to be destroyed in flight the boosters fragmented 
into thousands of pieces and the explosive properties of unburned 
solid motor propellant were greater than originally determined in 
laboratory tests 
because of this new information the statement said nasa 
and the air force have determined that the prudent action is to 
minimize the population at the closein viewing areas 
accredited journalists will be able to work in the area except 
for the hours just before the launch and the launch itself the 
statement said 
during the prohibited period only media with an immediate 
need for the facilities at the press site will be allowed the 
rest it said will view the launch from a site on a causeway the 
alternate site will be equipped with a countdown clock audio 
commentary and video monitors 
about 3000 members of the media have requested accreditation 
for the first postchallenger launch that of discovery which is 
expected to occur in about two weeks the exact number that will be 
permitted at the press site has not been disclosed 
the letter to reagan from the congressional committee headed by 
rep robert a roe dnj said in part although we have no 
doubt that the new assessments leading to this proposal are well 
intended the calculation of such risks is highly uncertain 
it asked the president to intercede and permit continued access 
to traditional viewing areas

political jockeying over family issues is 
taking a new turn in the wake of republican presidential nominee 
george bushs remark that women with newborns should not face loss 
of their jobs if they take a few weeks off 
house democrats jumped on bushs comment monday and urged the 
vice president to support a family leave bill that both chambers 
are expected to vote on this month 
we would welcome your support for and participation in the 
consideration of the bill so that it may be enacted into law this 
year five legislators backed by democratic leaders told bush 
in a letter 
the family and medical leave act would require employers of more 
than 50 to grant unpaid jobprotected leaves to parents of 
newborn newly adopted or seriously ill children seriously ill 
employees and workers who must care for sick parents 
democratic nominee michael dukakis a longtime supporter of the 
measure reiterated his view in a letter monday to rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo and sen christopher dodd dconn two of the 
bills chief sponsors 
the massachusetts governor said the bill would bring us one 
step closer to a more humane workplace for all americans 
in the letter to bush schroeder and four other house members 
said the reagan administration has opposed the family leave act 
since its introduction in 1985 by schroeder and rep william clay 
dmo 
however the press has reported a willingness on your part to 
reverse this historically held position and endorse family and 
medical leave legislation the lawmakers said 
last friday before a gop womens group bush departed from his 
text and also from the administrations hardline opposition to 
governmentmandated family leaves 
look we also need to assure that women dont have to worry 
about getting their jobs back after having a child or caring for a 
child during a serious illness he told the illinois federation 
of republican women in rockford ill 
bush did not elaborate on the remark at the time but his 
campaign is developing a more detailed proposal 
the letter to bush was signed by clay schroeder and reps pat 
williams dmont norman mineta dcalif and augustus hawkins 
dcalif mineta is chairman of a leadership task force on the bill 
and hawkins is chairman of the education and labor committee 
dukakis in his letter to schroeder and dodd left no doubt he 
agrees that jobprotected leave should be available to men as well 
as women and for personal illness as well as a childs medical 
crisis 
a father who needs a few weeks to care for his sick son a 
worker who has cancer or a mother who brings home a new baby 
they should not have to sacrifice their jobs dukakis wrote 
the house bill which counts 16 republicans among its 151 
cosponsors would require employers to make 10week leaves 
available to parents of newborn or newly adopted children medical 
leaves of up to 15 weeks would have to be available businesses 
employing fewer than 50 would be exempt for at least three years 
the small business community is fighting the family leave bill 
on the grounds that it would create hardships for their companies 
and that the government shouldnt dictate employee benefits 
the general accounting office the investigative arm of 
congress has estimated the bill would cost businesses less than 
200 million

michael dukakis never will win an award for 
stirring oratory but generally he can be expected to deliver his 
speeches aided by a teleprompter without major gaffes 
but even the unemotional dukakis had to step back from the 
microphone and laugh at himself after flubbing a line in a speech 
on national security monday at a union hall in philadelphia 
the democratic nominee had just finished railing against vice 
president george bush for his role in the irancontra affair and 
promised that a dukakis admininstration never would sell arms to a 
terrorist nation 
his text then called for the following line i dont question 
george bushs patriotism 
instead dukakis said i dont question george bushs 
terrorism he immediately realized his error and after taking a 
few seconds to laugh along with his audience delivered the line 
from the text

ohio sen john glenn also is not high on the list of great 
orators in the democratic party but he delivered a lively and 
emotional defense of dukakis before the same philadelphia audience 
criticizing reagan administration budget and trade policies that 
glenn said were responsible for the massive us trade deficit 
glenn said reagan had failed to use his enormous powers to 
protect us trade interests 
theyve talked like rambo and theyve acted like bambi 
glenn said to the roaring approval of the partisan audience 
glenn the first man to orbit the earth used his stature as an 
american hero to defend dukakis in the flap over his veto of a 1977 
bill that would have required massachusetts teachers to lead 
students in reciting the pledge of allegiance 
dukakis vetoed the bill after being advised it was 
unconstitutional but bush and other republicans have raised the 
issue in notsosubtle attacks on dukakis patriotism 
glenn declaring himself to be very irritated by the gop 
attacks stood in front of a huge american flag as he denounced the 
republicans 
that pledge of allegiance to the flag of the united states is 
your pledge its my pledge its our pledge and its michael 
dukakis pledge glenn said 
glenn also accused the republicans of ignoring the final six 
words of the pledge with liberty and justice for all

dukakis visit monday to philadelphia was without a major 
protest in stark contrast to an event he held here on labor day as 
part of his fall campaign kickoff 
a small group of antiabortion protesters gathered outside the 
union hall where dukakis delivered a speech on national security 
and a handful also met the democratic nominee outside a 
philadelphia television studio 
the relative calm came just a week after a dukakis event in a 
nearby neighborhood was disrupted by about 100 antiabortion 
protesters whose chants drowned out most of dukakis remarks to 
residents of a narrow street where he held an outdoor meeting 
the advance man who arranged the labor day event has since been 
fired by the dukakis campaign

an outgrowth of the hospitals 2yearold frozen meal program for 
recently released patients and the elderly ascolese said

parishioners who once admired their 
minister of nearly two decades expressed mixed emotions as he went 
on trial on charges he decapitated a handyman in an attempt to 
assume a new identity 
the criminal court trial of the rev david terry began monday 
with jury selection which is expected to take most of the week he 
is charged with firstdegree murder and arson and faces the death 
penalty 
james c mathenys decapitated body was found in a rolledup 
carpet in the burnedout remains of the emmanuel church of christ 
pentecostal oneness where terry 43 preached 
two days before this happened we would have given him our last 
dime said marsha brown 30 who with others in the congregation 
has been attending weekly services in a borrowed building in nearby 
gallatin i dont feel personally betrayed more let down than 
anything else 
its just a lot of mixed feelings about him terry right 
now said teresa matheny the victims exwife i hope he can 
tell the truth so that he will have a chance of getting forgiveness 
from god 
mrs matheny said she and the victim were close to a 
reconciliation when his body was found june 15 1987 
the congregation once closely knit was stunned by the slaying 
and the churchs burning 
some parishioners though have stuck by terry the congregation 
numbers about 40 about 20 members have left since the slaying 
mrs brown said 
i think as far as the evidence is concerned i believe hes 
guilty said marlane mcclanahan 35 who has not been attending 
services held by the current pastor the rev wayne cole im sad 
for him terry i guess im a little bitter but you have to keep 
the love of god no matter what 
he was a friend virginia howard 63 another member of the 
congregation said of terry we had known him since he was a boy 
our children and he grew up together there wasnt anything ever 
bad about the boy he just did good things were amazed that 
someone weve known and never knew anything bad against is guilty 
of this 
police say terry tried to fake his own death by putting his belt 
and other clothing on the headless body which also was missing 
part of the right arm and two spots where matheny had tattoos 
court documents allege that matheny 32 was killed in terrys 
attempt to assume a new identity and disappear with 50000 in 
church funds a drivers license with terrys photograph but issued 
in the name of a man dead since 1951 was later recovered with other 
false identification issued in the same name 
mathenys head and arm were cut off with butcherlike precision 
police said terry once earned extra money as a supermarket butcher

a windwhipped fire racing through 
the gold rush country of the sierra nevada foothills monday 
destroyed 138 homes and other structures and forced more than 8000 
people to evacuate 
some 4500 residents of the lake wildwood area where some 
houses cost 1 million were forced from their homes twice in the 
past two days as the outofcontrol wildfire raged through rugged 
terrain 
late monday hundreds more were ordered from the communities of 
smartville rough and ready and penn valley said state office of 
emergency services spokesman david sandino bringing to 3500 the 
number evacuated from that area in two days 
two firefighters were injured and others had to dive for cover 
as capricious winds drove the fire through timber and dry brush 
about 60 miles northeast of sacramento or about 150 miles 
northeast of san francisco 
the latest evacuations were ordered after the fires 70foot 
flames jumped a highway and headed southwest threatening hundreds 
of scattered rural dwellings 
there are hundreds here and they are pouring in said red 
cross worker elizabeth quirk at the nevada union high school 
evacuation center the school buses are bringing in senior 
citizens and there are campers and motor homes in the parking 
lot 
by late monday the blaze dubbed the 49er fire had burned an 
estimated 15000 acres or nearly 25 square miles of western 
nevada county flames threatened the high technology grass valley 
group the countys largest employer with 1000 workers 
authorities said the fire reached three sides of the companys 
grounds and that a storage shed had been burned 
the yuba county board of supervisors met in emergency session in 
marysville to declare the zone a local disaster area and expressed 
concern that the fire may threaten beale air force base near 
marysville 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base of 
the sr71 blackbird spy plane 
the blaze was fueled by droughtdry brush wood shake roofs and 
propane tanks which exploded like small bombs in the intense heat 
said state department of forestry spokesman charlie jakobs 
the destroyed structures were valued at 9 million according to 
the us forest service along with 84 homes 54 outbuildings also 
were razed said ann westling a forest service spokeswoman she 
said the figure represented only a preliminary estimate of losses 
and that it could climb higher 
two firefighters were burned when their truck was caught in 
flames one suffered leg burns was wrapped in wet gauze and taken 
by helicopter to a nearby hospital the other man was treated at 
the scene 
about 40 men in two fire crews were forced to use their portable 
fire shelters when wind shifted suddenly and swept the flames over 
them 
flames engulfed a bulldozer forcing the operator to wrap 
himself in an asbestos blanket and take refuge under the vehicle 
it was one of 11 fires that destroyed nearly 30000 acres of 
timber and brush in five rural california counties monday 
residents of this affluent mountain town of 4500 people 45 
miles northeast of sacramento and the tiny town of rough and ready 
were evacuated sunday and highway 49 was closed 
they were allowed to begin returning home monday morning but 
were ordered evacuated again later 
smartville evacuated later is about 15 miles west of the 
nevada citygrass valley area the largest communities in the 
region penn valley and lake wildwwood are about six miles west of 
nevada city 
a force that had grown to 1700 firefighters saved the majority 
of the resort homes but flames destroyed 13 large resort homes 
five boats and a dock nineteen other structures outside of the 
lake wildwood area were destroyed including several residential 
trailers and agricultural buildings 
it skipped through the community burning yards and oak trees 
between large houses some valued at 1 million 
in some places flames reached the town lake igniting marina 
railings several boats and a dock 
i was coming back from the bahamas sitting in san francisco 
international airport and i see my fathers house burning on 
television said insurance agent don sanzone 41 he said the 
3000squarefoot home was destroyed even though it was separated 
from the forest by pavement 
its amazing one burns down right in between others that 
dont and this one that burned had a tile roof said fes 
venardi 67 who lives two house away from one destroyed home 
i never thought this would happen sanzone said i didnt 
think there was enough underbrush but the wind was blowing so 
bad 
wind was estimated at 25 to 30 mph monday throughout most of 
northern california but higher gusts were reported on the fire 
lines 
the wind is our biggest enemy out here today said jakobs 
we had a solid front of fire about a halfmile long moving at a 
rapid rate through dense brush and timber 
the 49er fire reportedly started along highway 49 named for 
the 1849 gold rush towns it winds among about six miles north of 
nevada city by a transient burning toilet paper 
the fire spread southwest away from the nearest populated areas 
but pushed by gusting winds it quickly skipped in a matter of 
hours over nearly 10 miles of unpopulated foothills to the posh 
lake wildwood area 
a second nevada county fire burned along highway 49 in an area 
of brush light timber and scattered homes midway between grass 
valley and auburn 
most schools were closed in the region thick smoke made it 
unsafe to operate school buses and the red cross converted at 
least three schools into temporary evacuation centers 
the lake wildwood residents some of whom fought alongside fire 
crews were first pulled out sunday they were allowed to return 
early today only to be ordered out later said jakobs 
state department of forestry information officer john carter 
said about 5000 state federal and local firefighters were 
battling nine other timber and brush fires monday mostly in remote 
areas no homes were destroyed in any of those blazes

the new miss america says her title should give 
her a platform to help young people lost in an increasingly amoral 
society 
im an ambassador now for america gretchen elizabeth 
carlson told a news conference monday 
i feel that we are living in an amoral world that society has 
truly lost its bearings its moral values said the 22yearold 
from anoka minn 
crowned early sunday in atlantic city nj miss carlson said 
she wants to attend harvard law school and become a lawyer 
among the countrys problems are the divorce rate drugs 
violence sex issues she said 
all of these things are manifestations of the breakdown of the 
family actually i feel thats where it starts our morals and our 
values our society is lax 
in addition miss carlson has found that our children today 
are more narcissistic they are in love with themselves we are in 
an individualistic era 
one solution would be better education she said 
my concern about education is that there is not enough time 
being spent on curriculum she said i dont necessarily think 
it would involve more funds to help this problem i think we just 
need more stringent guidelines 
another solution is to teach about volunteerism she said 
miss carlson said she can help as miss america because people 
will listen to her she said her outstanding attribute is her 
intelligence 
a registered republican miss carlson said she voted in 1984 for 
president reagan but has not made up her mind about whether to vote 
for vice president george bush or gov michael dukakis in november 
miss carlson said she disagreed with a recent runnerup at a 
california pageant who turned out to be a feminist opposed to miss 
americatype contests 
she talks about exploitation it is exactly the opposite we 
are showing off what the young women of today truly are she said

archaelogists sifting through the rubble of 
a colonial barracks that housed hessian soldiers defeated by george 
washington in the revolutionary war have found some surprises 
prehistoric artifacts almost 4000 years old 
its really turning out to be a very exciting project 
project director ian burrows said monday it shows there are 
wellpreserved prehistoric remains right underneath trenton 
the dig by the hunter research associates archaeological firm 
began about four weeks ago in this state capital as part of the 
24 million renovation of old barracks museum 
the barracks a bunkhouse where soldiers lived joined to an 
officers house was built in 1758 it was used at various times 
through history to house british and american soldiers smallpox 
victims and single women and widows the original no longer stands 
and a reconstruction forms the museum 
however the structure is best known for its significance in the 
battle of trenton in 1776 in december of that year gen 
washingtons warweary soldiers crossed the delaware river into new 
jersey and defeated hessian troops stationed at the barracks 
it marked the first time hessians west german mercenaries who 
fought for the british were defeated by washington who went on 
to win several key victories 
the state hired burrows firm to determine the original layout 
of the building as well as to find the parade grounds where 
soldiers performed military drills 
but in the course of their work the archaeologists discovered 
artifacts and sites dating back nearly 4000 years 
for instance near the southwest section of the building 
workers found projectile points some resembling arrowheads and 
other artifacts dating back to 2000 bc said dick regensburg a 
prehistoric specialist working on the project 
historians are excited by the finds said museum director 
cynthia koch 
weve had a lot of prehistoric archaelogists from all over the 
state coming over to look she said 
near the southeast part of the building archaeologists 
discovered part of an indian hearth from between 500 and 700 ad 
workers also uncovered a piece of a clay tobacco pipe carrying a 
design that dates it to between 1000 and 1500 ad 
the findings suggest the area was a popular settlement used over 
and over by succeeding generations because it sits on a bluff near 
the delaware river and between two streams the assunpink creek 
and pettys run 
when people started to think about it it made perfect 
sense said ms koch 
as for the original renovation project burrows and his crew 
have found evidence of support posts for the secondfloor 
balconies a possible staircase in the front of the building and 
groundlevel windows which seemed to have been bricked up about 20 
years after the structure was built 
workers also found part of the parade grounds burrows said 
a musket ball and boot spur are among a number of artifacts 
dating back about 240 years found near the buildings foundation 
he said 
the archaeological evidence is very well preserved burrows 
said theres a lot of information in the ground

employees of the port at the pacific 
end of the panama canal stopped most operations in a strike to 
demand payment of bonuses and students protesting the delays 
clashed with police sources said 
luis asprilla secretary general of the workers association 
said the strike by most of the ports 800 employees paralyzed cargo 
and fueling operations monday and stopped food and water supplies 
to ships 
he said the strike would continue indefinitely 
panama canal operations were not affected 
asprilla said workers were demanding the government pay 
onethird of annual bonuses 
about 20000 government employees held a demonstration last 
thursday to demand payment of similar annual bonuses 
the government financially strapped in part by us economic 
sanctions has said it will make the payments soon but does not 
have sufficient funds now 
in a related incident a group of high school students 
protesting the late payments clashed with police outside a school 
monday witnesses said 
a leader of the parents association of the school the national 
institute said 20 students were struck by police police denied 
the report 
the education ministry closed the school indefinitely 
last week a cash shortage forced the cabinet to cut the pay of 
gen manuel noriega and other top officials from 125 percent to 30 
percent a government communique said the cuts would save about 
230000 a month 
panamas oncethriving economy has been hardhit by several 
months of political protests demanding noriegas ouster us 
sanctions imposed to force the general to leave and a period when 
banks were closed or handled only limited operations business 
sources say the economy is about half what it was in early 1987 
earlier this year the government had trouble meeting its 
payroll 
noriega who as commander of the defense forces is the power 
behind the civilian government is charged with drug trafficking in 
the united states 
he denies the charges and accuses the united states of trying to 
undermine the panamanian government as part of a plan to avoid 
turning the panama canal over to the central american country under 
treaties signed in 1977

voters settle primary contests in six states today including a 
highstakes democratic senate race in wisconsin bitter legislative 
battles in arizona and republican clashes in two states where 
mothers of small children were criticized for seeking office 
in wisconsin democrat william proxmires decision to retire 
after 31 years in the senate enticed four members of his party into 
the race including former gov anthony s earl who lost a 
reelection bid two years ago earl appeared to be the frontrunner 
until the entry of milwaukee bucks basketball team owner herbert 
kohl who spent 21 million much of it his own money on tv ads 
a poll published by the milwaukee journal on sunday showed kohl 
preferred by 43 percent of the voters earl by 40 percent edward 
r garvey an unsuccessful senate candidate in 1986 by 8 percent 
secretary of state douglas j la follette 5 percent and 4 percent 
undecided the poll had a margin of error of 6 percent 
the heavy spending by kohl became a major campaign issue 
especially since proxmire spent just 14510 in his last race 
la follette who reported spending 15536 ran a radio 
commercial that began with the sound of a toilet flushing his way 
of saying that a wisconsin tradition of personal campaigning was 
going down the drain 
a garvey commercial showed a frankenstein monster with a 
television on its shoulders and a kohl ad on the screen in the 
background film clips from horror movies showed citizens fleeing 
in terror 
the republican field was smaller but the fighting was just as 
intense with senate minority leader susan engeleiter pitted 
against former state party chairman stephen b king engeleiter 
labeled king an ultraconservative while he condemned her as a 
liberal and also questioned whether she could campaign for and hold 
an office like the senate while also taking care of two small 
children 
in the journal poll engeleiter held a 61 percent to 30 percent 
lead 
motherhood also became an issue in new hampshire where former 
state legislator betty tamposi and former state supreme court 
justice charles douglas are the frontrunners in a sixway gop race 
for the nomination to succeed republican rep judd gregg 
last week sen gordon humphrey a douglas supporter said 
tamposi should stay home and care for her toddler daughter 
humphrey apologized for his dumb remark after it was roundly 
denounced and deplored by virtually everyone 
gregg gave up his seat to run for governor after republican 
incumbent john sununu announced he was retiring gregg is heavily 
favored in the gop primary against robert shaw a former manchester 
mayor and political unknown william lawrence the winner will face 
democratic lawyer paul mceachern a staunch opponent of the 
seabrook nuclear power plant who narrowly lost sununu in 1986 
in neighboring vermont another longtime republican congressman 
is giving up his seat to run for higher office jim jeffords who 
is seeking the nomination to replace retiring republican sen 
robert stafford 
jeffords as popular with democrats as with republicans is 
favored in a primary over michael griffes a former grumman corp 
employee griffes has attacked jeffords independence which in 
1987 earned him the secondhighest antireagan voting record of any 
house republican as analyzed by congressional quarterly magazine 
former gop gov richard snelling donated 1000 to the griffes 
campaign but declined to endorse griffes saying the 35yearold 
political newcomer had not sufficiently established his 
credentials 
the winner of the race will face democrat william gray a former 
us attorney 
in arizona the main focus has been on state legislative races 
in which a number of gop candidates are ultraconservative backers 
of ousted gov evan mecham in some cases they are challenging 
republican lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict mecham for 
obstructing justice and misusing funds 
after his removal mecham predicted a revolution at the ballot 
box but he insists that those who keep talking about the mecham 
factor are trying to divert the attention of the voters from 
the real issue record tax and spending increases that were passed 
after his departure to bail the state out of a deficit 
the two other states holding primaries today are minnesota 
where voters are expected to nominate republican sen david 
durenberger for a third term and give democratic attorney general 
hubert h skip humphrey iii the right to challenge him and 
utah which has just one contested congressional race

authorities banned a television broadcast 
by the opposition because it contained a report on torture of 
dissidents political activists said 
the banned 15minute latenight segment is the only televised 
political program allowed to opponents of president augusto 
pinochet the sole candidate in a presidential referendum next 
month that could extend his rule for eight years 
also monday six people wounded during street violence sunday 
were reported in serious condition with gunshot wounds all were 
from cerro navia a northwestern workingclass suburb of santiago 
where gen pinochets motorcade was stoned by angry protesters on 
sundays 15th anniversary of the military coup in which he seized 
power 
national police responded by using tear gas and water cannon to 
disperse demonstrators who hurled stones and set up barricades of 
burning tires 
about 50 people were wounded and 400 arrested police said 
the governmentcontrolled national television council said the 
opposition program was rejected monday night because it did not 
abide by the electoral law which grants the government and 
opposition 15 minutes each of free time on national television to 
carry their message to voters in an oct 5 presidential referendum 
the free nightly broadcasts from 1045 pm to 1115 pm are 
the only television advertisements allowed to the opposition the 
government has ample access to the television which it controls 
the programs started one week ago 
a coalition of 16 parties opposing the reelection of pinochet 
said the program was censored because it included an interview with 
a judge rene garcia who told about the torture of political 
dissidents by security agents 
we reject the attempt by government officials to determine 
what chileans can and can not see on television the coalition 
said in a statement our struggle in the upcoming referendum 
includes the promotion of a complete freedom of expresion and 
rejection of any kind of censorship 
the governments 15minute program was broadcast normally monday 
night in addition the government has maintained for months a 
series of ads urging voters to support pinochet in the referendum 
the law prohibits political advertisement on television but the 
government claims it is not breaking the law it says its ads do 
not constitute political propaganda but an information to 
citizens on its works and achievements 
the national television council that censored the opposition 
program includes education minister juan guzman and several other 
government officials 
the councils secretary alfredo lustig appeared on state 
television to say that the opposition program was barred because 
the comments by judge garcia had not been authorized by the court 
in which he serves 
the opposition called the councils decision illegal and 
unconstitutional 
genaro ariagada secretary general of the opposition coalition 
denied the censored program broke the law 
the only one that has broken the law here is the national 
television council arriagada said this an abuse that every 
decent chilean citizen must reject 
when the time came for the opposition program to be broadcast a 
sign appeared on the screen saying it had been suspended because it 
did not abide by the law 
within minutes residents in a number of santiago neighborhoods 
started banging empty pots from inside their homes a traditional 
form of protest 
in the oct 5 referendum voters will vote yes or no on 
pinochet the single candidate nominated by the nations military 
commanders including pinochet himself as commander of the army 
about 72 million voters are registered for the oct 5 poll if 
approved by voters pinochet will start a new eightyear term next 
march if rejected an open election will be held within a year 
with pinochet remaining in power until then 
pinochet toppled the elected government of president salvador 
allende and took power sept 11 1973 allende a marxist died in 
the takeover

the british government citing evidence from the 
united states pressed for a un investigation of charges that 
iraq used chemical weapons against ethnic kurds 
we now consider the weight of evidence of the use of chemical 
weapons to be compelling said a foreign office spokesman who in 
accordance with british practice demanded anonymity 
the united states britain west germany and japan asked un 
secretary general javier perez de cuellar on monday to send a team 
to iraq to investigate the allegations that poison gas was used 
against the kurds the new york times reported in todays editions 
in a story from washington the newspaper cited unidentified 
diplomatic sources as saying the request from the four allies 
reflects a growing irritation with the iraqi government for 
ignoring un protests over prior use of chemical weapons during 
iraqs 8year war with iran 
the british foreign office said it toughened its stand monday 
partly because of us state department evidence of such attacks 
which led the senate on friday to vote for tough economic sanctions 
against iraq 
the measure still must be approved by the house and signed by 
president reagan 
last week the foreign office summoned the iraqi ambassador and 
expressed grave concern about the alleged attacks but at the 
time british officials maintained there was no firm evidence the 
charges were true 
there is now compelling evidence to trigger action said the 
foreign office spokesman 
he said that in terms of a recent un resolution the next step 
was an independent investigation by perez de cuellar before a 
decision on sanctions 
iraqi ambassador mohammed sadiq almashat has reiterated his 
governments denials of the charges and told britain to stop 
interfering in iraqs internal affairs 
british official sources have acknowledged a reluctance by 
britain and other western european countries to accuse iraq for 
fear they said of upsetting the delicate ceasefire in the 
8yearold war between iran and iraq 
the foreign office maintained monday it had changed its mind 
also because of other evidence including reports from western 
journalists in turkey where thousands of iraqi kurds many 
suffering chemical injuries have fled 
in a kurdish refugee camp near silopi turkey near the iraqi 
border refugees on monday showed reporters a 13yearold boy with 
severe burns on his face and neck that they said were caused by 
poison gas attacks 
the kurds claim iraq used the chemical weapons as part of a 
bloody offensive against the kurds an ethnic group in northern 
iraq that is seeking autonomy 
about 60000 kurds recently fled iraq to turkey citing poison 
gas attacks 
in cairo meanwhile egypt criticized the senate sanctions 
which a foreign ministry official contended were groundless the 
official cited a turkish anatolia news agency report claiming there 
was no case proving iraq used these banned weapons 
turkey said friday no evidence of the use of chemical weapons 
was found while screening sick and injured refugees

a publishing company closed its offices in 
the belief that millions of the faithful will be called to heaven 
today in a prelude to the second coming most religious scholars 
and ministers doubt it 
all such forecasts in the past have been wrong noted malcolm 
tolbert professor of new testament interpretation at southeastern 
theological seminary in wake forest 
nonetheless a woman who answered the telephone at the world 
bible society in nashville tenn monday said the office was 
closed to give employees time to be with their families the 
company published the book by edgar c whisenant that contains the 
prediction 88 reasons the rapture will be in 1988 
if anyone is left here theyll be here wednesday morning 
said a woman named lorraine who refused to give her last name 
the odds of anybody being right are certainly greater than the 
odds of winning the recent florida lottery tolbert said monday 
he noted that such predictions have been made countless times in 
the past 2000 years nobodys been right 
some evangelical and pentecostal interpreters of biblical 
prophecy believe the rapture is a sort of prelude to christs 
second coming 
but tolbert said people who believe in the theory support it by 
plucking various passages from the new testament 
people are treating the bible as sort of a smorgasboard 
and come out with a kind of unified approach that is not justified 
by any single passage in the bible he said so what you have 
is interpretations by people who are not biblical scholars 
whisenant a former rocket engineer predicted the rapture would 
come by tonight he used mathematical calculations and biblical 
interpretations to predict that it would occur in the 48 hours of 
this years jewish new year 40 years and 120 days after israel 
became a nation on may 14 1948 
the time of the rapture by noon edt was determined according 
to the hour of sunset in jerusalem said kaay general manager 
dianne mcarthur whose little rock ark radio station has been 
carrying whisenants rapture 88 ministries programs since march 
whisenant spent most of monday in little rock trying to spread 
his message 
he fully expects to be taken to heaven today ms mcarthur said 
whisenant will not talk with the secular press because god 
plainly told him not to sensationalize this she said 
whisenant a 56yearold selftaught bible student has 
predicted on broadcasts carried by more than 90 radio stations 
nationwide that jesus would rapture the church take the 
faithful to heaven 
but several ministers said the exact time of the second coming 
could not be pinpointed 
how do they know that asked the rev md battle of the 
praise temple church in raleigh because jesus said he didnt 
even know the minute or the hour i dont believe the rapture is 
coming by tuesday night of course jesus could come at any time 
the rev tom vestal of mount olivet baptist church in raleigh 
said i have had calls from all over the state from people asking 
do you think jesus is coming tuesday 
he said some of the callers were concerned that jesus really 
is coming before they have a chance to be married or have a family 
or see their children grown

blades of grass and wildflowers 
are sprouting through much of the blackened earth at yellowstone 
national park heralding a dynamic rebirth in the wake of the 
fires park researchers say 
the vegetation was spotted around grant village which was 
besieged by flames last month said john varley yellowstones 
chief of research 
in other areas of the park scorched pine cones from lodgepole 
pines yellowstones predominant conifer are slowly opening to 
spill their seeds to the earth he said monday 
however it is hard to say how quickly the burned areas will 
rebound from the devastating summer of 1988 varley said 
in the 16 years since us forest service and national park 
service officials adopted a letitburn policy for most 
naturally caused fires there have been approximately 140 wildfires 
in yellowstone that seared some 33000 acres said the researcher 
but those fires didnt fully prepare researchers for this summers 
blazes so predicting how the forests will rebound is not easy he 
added 
we have a considerable body of knowledge on the rate at which 
these things recover said varley were pretty confident that 
they would come back well 
to help make those projections a team of scientists and 
researchers will meet next month to study the aftermath varley 
said 
the fires have created a huge laboratory for varley and his 
colleagues that will show them yellowstones regenerative 
capabilities it also will show tourists the devastation of fires 
it is not dead stressed varley there are some tops of 
things that are certainly killed but again on the basis of the 16 
years that experience that weve had with fire and the research 
thereof we know that there will be a lot of sprouting we know 
that most of the living organisms are underneath the surface of the 
soil and still are alive and well 
the grasses and flowers that have reappeared around grant 
village said varley have done so without rainfall 
these plants are remarkably resilient to fire he said 
most of the species have insurance policies so to speak because 
theyve been putting up with fire for thousands of years some of 
the strategies are truly remarkable 
one example he said is the lodgepole pine its cones are 
covered by resins that are melted away by fire causing that cone 
to open up slowly after the fire passes 
and so in many of these areas in places that totally look 
like moonscapes then these seeds are being broadcasted out over 
the forest floor right now and thats the next generation that 
will be coming up varley said

the government said today it has 
agreed with hungary to open permanent missions the first 
diplomatic relations between south korea and a communist nation 
the move to normalize relations stopped short of full diplomatic 
recognition but south korean officials said they expected the two 
nations to establish diplomatic ties in the near future 
the seoul government is hoping the olympic games which begin in 
seoul on saturday will play a major role in helping to open 
relations with communist nations 
foreign minister choi kwangsoo went on national television to 
announce the two governments had agreed to open missions in their 
capitals of seoul and budapest to oversee trade scientific and 
cultural relations and consular affairs 
the two governments agreed to start negotiations on establishing 
full diplomatic relations a ministry statement said 
both governments expressed their determination to bring their 
negotiations to a success as soon as possible it said 
south korea has no relations with communist nations because of 
its bitter rivalry with communist north korea the north has 
opposed any ties between communist nations and south korea 
president roh taewoo who took office in february has worked 
to establish relations with communist nations to try to reduce 
tension with north korea and to boost trade 
roh wants to establish relations with the norths main allies 
china and the soviet union to reduce their support for any north 
korean threat to the south 
the exchange of missions is very significant in that south 
korea has secured a bridgehead for south koreas advance into the 
east european bloc said a senior official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
china the soviet union and most other communist nations ignored 
a north korean call to boycott the olympics the seoul government 
hopes the participation of communist nations in the olympics will 
play a major role in developing relations 
north korea said it will boycott the olympics because its demand 
to be a cohost of the games was turned down by the international 
olympic committee on the grounds that they are awarded to a single 
city 
north korea invaded the south in 1950 and sparked the bloody 
threeyear korean war the two sides technically remain at war 
since no peace treaty was signed and the north has staged a series 
of attacks on the south over the years 
south korea and hungary agreed last year to establish trade 
offices in the first such move between seoul and a communist nation 
the seoul government is anxious to develop trade with communist 
nations to open new markets and reduce its dependence on the united 
states as its main export market

managers at pilgrim nuclear power plant shut down 
since 1986 under a government order can handle a restart under 
careful supervision federal regulators concluded 
a nuclear regulatory commission inspection at pilgrim recently 
concluded with high confidence that boston edison co 
management controls programs and personnel are ready to support 
safe startup and operation of the plant an nrc official said 
monday 
the commission ordered the closing because of technical and 
management problems 
an inspection conducted aug 824 found no fundamental flaws 
that would inhibit reactor or public safety during plant operation 
said samuel j collins the nrcs deputy director of the reactor 
projects division 
inspectors reached their conclusions after carefully monitoring 
managers performance and qualifications said collin 
he said the problem of how to decide if managers could do a good 
job of running a nuclear power plant by judging their performance 
at an idled facility was partly solved by using a simulator 
the nrc is still evaluating whether the plant should be allowed 
to restart 
collins noted that intense supervision would be necessary under 
actual operating conditions we intend to stay very close to that 
station during any proposed restart program he said 
boston edison has proposed a fourmonth supervisory plan for the 
restart process said utility spokeswoman elaine robinson 
its a very careful wellconsidered approach to the restart 
process there will be very intensive nrc oversight but it also 
provides for additional senior management oversight she said 
the inspection consisted of interviews with licensee personnel 
plant tours observations of plant activities and selective 
examinations of procedures records and documents inspectors also 
observed plant activities on all shifts 
most of the senior management is new since 1986 but many 
department heads remained in place ms robinson said 
the previous management was often unstable fixing a problem in 
one area but then neglecting to maintain the improvement collins 
said 
the team they have now appears to be committed to the station 
and they have a pretty good track record in the industry collins 
said

unofficial results monday showed lt gov sb woo the winner by 
a slim 88vote margin over civic activist samuel s beard for the 
democratic nomination to challenge republican us sen william v 
roth jr in novembers election 
nearly 48 hours earlier beard was declared the victor in 
saturdays primary but on monday the unofficial statewide tally 
showed woo the winner with 20221 votes to beards 20133 
at beards request the new castle county board of elections 
voted unanimously for a recount the second tally was scheduled to 
begin wednesday morning and both candidates expressed anger over 
the delay 
the delay was due to the need to collect voting machines from 
around the state said william burke deputy administrative 
director for the department of elections for new castle county one 
of three counties in delaware 
woos win came after beard lost 2800 votes when a computer 
keypunch error was discovered 
meanwhile woo became angry late monday night when one of his 
staffers discovered the doors to the department of elections for 
new castle county were wide open 
woo was at the election departments office and could not be 
reached for comment but his wife katy said they believed the 
keys to voting machines were kept in the office 
attorney general charles m oberly iii said he was contacted by 
woo about the unlocked doors and ordered wilmington police to guard 
the door overnight 
election officials learned early monday that a computer keypunch 
operators error had recorded 2800 votes too many for beard 
according to paul t hart administrative director of the county 
elections department 
the discrepancy came in a district in new castle county where 
there are about 280 registered democrats in that district beards 
total was tallied at 2828 votes when he actually received only 28 
votes officials said 
woo a 51yearold physics professor at the university of 
delaware became the nations highest ranking chineseamerican in 
state office after being elected lieutenant governor four years ago 
in his first bid for elected office 
his opponent in that election battle robinson requested and 
received a statewide recount woo won by 429 votes 
beard had been heavily outspent by woo a native of shanghai 
china who enjoyed the financial backing of chineseamericans from 
across the nation 
beard 49 had support from most democratic organization leaders 
and labor he has served as chairman for job creation commissions 
under the last four presidents

a public defender faces a weeklong jail 
term for wearing green tennis shoes in court 
superior court judge william scholl ordered ralph malanga last 
month not to wear his green tennis shoes in court but malanga 
showed up in the shoes the next day 
if youre a member of the boston celtics its ok he told 
malanga but this is superior court 
the judge sentenced the lawyer monday saying the shoes 
detracted from the courts dignity he further prohibited the 
attorney from seeing other lawyers during his jail term 
malanga wearing brown leather shoes asked scholl monday to 
drop the matter saying the issue was moot because neither he nor 
anyone else is wearing sneakers any more 
he apologized but scholl was unmoved even when malanga told 
him that he was supposed to go to trial today representing a 
defendant in a firstdegree murder case 
the attitude of a lawyer to the court must be one of 
respect scholl said 
when a lawyer comes to court wearing green sneakers after he is 
told not to its no longer funny its contempt scholl said 
malanga said he probably would try to get the state court of 
appeals to stay the sentence then added maybe ill just let him 
put me in jail if he thinks thats appropriate

okla from a pay telephone atop the mountain marla and the other 
aunt saw a van matching the description of the kidnappers vehicle 
marla jumped back in her car to follow it while the other aunt 
stayed to tell the mother what was happening 
soon the van pulled over and the driver waved her by she said 
but i got out of the car and had the gun in my pocket and i 
walked up to the car and i saw the girl there and thats when i 
pulled the gun out and i told him to get out of the car and told 
him to get in front of the van and lie down 
he lay down in the ditch in front of the van 
she then told her niece to get out of the van and into her car 
and lock the doors she told passersby to call the police 
i just held him there until the police came when the police 
came i just walked over to the car and hugged the girl 
marla recalled that when police arrived she had to tell them 
she didnt know how to uncock the pistol the officer had her put 
the gun on the ground

saying the time has come for him to 
move on mayor henry cisneros vowed not to seek a fifth term but 
declined to rule out the possibility of running for a higher office 
in the future 
the 41yearold mayors fourth 2year term will expire next 
spring and cisneros said he will go into private life 
along with handing over the gavel to the nations ninthlargest 
city cisneros also will pass along some major civic projects he 
once said were the reasons he wasnt interested in seeking higher 
office 
when his term ends the popular mayor and one of the countrys 
leading hispanic politicians will have served his native city for 
14 years 
its been work and its been fun mostly its been the most 
engrossing and fulfilling thing ive ever done cisneros said at 
a news conference monday 
basically ive been at it for 14 years eight years as mayor 
and six as council member thats a long time to go at full 
throttle he said 
our country believes that eight years in a high office should 
be enough to get a job done presidents serve eight years 
governors serve eight years and eight years is a good round number 
for a mayor especially this one he said 
the charismatic bilingual mayor has served on several 
international commissions was interviewed by walter mondale as a 
potential vice presidential running mate in 1984 and was frequently 
mentioned as a possible cabinetlevel appointee 
last year cisneros said he would not be running for statewide 
office because he wanted to devote time to san antonio projects and 
to his son john paul anthony who was born with a congenital heart 
defect and stomach abnormalities 
earlier this year cisneros declined an offer to make a keynote 
address to the democratic national convention the former president 
of the national league of cities said he wanted to devote time to 
the city projects which include a controversial 160 million domed 
stadium proposal and a regional water plan 
cisneros was approached this year by several san antonio 
businessmen about the prospect of forming a business to handle 
business investments he said he has since received numerous job 
offers but declined to elaborate 
the mayors salary is less than 5000 with two daughters 
nearing college age and an ill infant cisneros supplemented that 
income by writing columns and giving lectures however he had to 
cut back on outside activities because of the health of his son and 
the timeconsuming city projects 
today is a little sad for me it has to be cisneros said 
monday but i expect to wake up tomorrow morning ready to make 
the most of the next eight months same pace same energy same 
devotion to the city until midnight of the day before the next 
mayor takes office

the craziest new gadgets may get the 
most attention at the second annual invention convention this 
weekend but organizers hope the show dispells the notion that 
inventors are wacky 
were trying to stress high tech this year spokeswoman suzy 
mallery said monday it seems everybody pictures inventors as 
some kind of longhaired weirdos and were trying to change that 
weve got some hightech stuff that will blow your mind ms 
mallery said 
a magnetic car that travels 200 mph a flying boat an automatic 
squeezehandle screw driver and a soundemitting chair that is 
supposed to provide the equivalent of eight hours of sleep in 20 
minutes are among the 300 inventions that will be on exhibit 
another thing organizers hope to change with the displays are 
the relatively small number of americans marketing their creations 
said steve gnass a beverly hills marketing consultant who runs the 
convention 
we think the convention is rekindling americas creative 
spirit gnass said inventors are the underpinning of our 
economic future politics have never really done anything 
revolutionary for people its been technology thats always put us 
ahead advanced civilization 
half of the us patents issued last year went to foreigners 
gnass said 
some 20000 people are expected to attend the fourday affair at 
the pasadena center ms mallery said 
the convention starts with seminars and panels thursday and 
exhibitions are open to the public saturady and sunday 
also on tap are more than 50 seminars for wouldbe inventors 
panel speakers will include yoshiro nakamats inventor of the 
computer floppy disc and jack ryan who dreamed up the barbie doll

rose boyer loaded her station wagon 
with family pictures and memorabilia and her husband bud sprayed 
water on the dry grass around their home while a mountain blaze 
flickered just up the hillside 
we stayed last night and i want to stay but a fire is one of 
the worst of my fears she said late monday night 
at least 15 homes have been lost in the affluent residential 
area and the fire continued to burn on the edge of the community 
about 60 miles northeast of sacramento on monday evening 
the outofcontrol mountain blaze has forced the evacuation of 
at least 8000 people at least 142 structures including nearly 
100 homes were destroyed according to officials who early today 
estimated the blaze had burned more than 20000 acres 
around the boyers home separated by a 30foot street and just 
one row of homes from the closest burning trees about a third of 
the homes were still occupied by residents who said they wouldnt 
leave until the last moment 
but boyer 48 said one sleepless night was all he and his 
46yearold wife could take 
we stayed last night but we didnt sleep at all didnt even 
try we stayed with the house all day he said it seems the 
fire came up backed down and now its back up again only closer 
for harry derrick 64 and his wife jean 63 the fire that 
brushed through this sierra foothill community was a stunning 
shock but not a new experience 
im going to think positively we went through it before and 
we will again mrs derrick said recalling being evacuated from 
a 1971 fire that came near their home in the los angeles suburb of 
chatsworth 
the derricks moved into their new retirement home here just a 
month ago i cant believe it mrs derrick said i dont 
even have the drapes up yet the paint isnt even dry this is just 
terrible 
for some residents the fire made a quick entrance into their 
community 
all of a sudden it was here said john bridges 30 it 
swept right past us even burned the brush under the deck but the 
house didnt catch i cant image all the things we would have 
lost he said 
bridges and a friend matt waldrom 28 said after the fire 
brushed past bridges home sunday night they joined about six other 
residents to help three professional firefighters 
i couldnt believe those guys waldrom said they told us 
exactly what to do and we saved maybe a half dozen homes and they 
told us watch out its coming 
it was half a mile away and two minutes later it was 100 
yards away and we got behind a building and it blew right by us 
ive never seen anything like it 
it was terrible bridges added but it was probably the 
most satisfying weekend of my life we saved some homes and i even 
saved my brand new truck

pope john paul began a tour of one of 
africas most prosperous and democratic countries today as the 
vatican announced a fifth papal visit to the continent next year 
south africa was not included 
botswana is an island of peace with itself and its 
neighbors the pope told an airport crowd of several thousand 
among them a choir of barebreasted schoolgirls in fact it can 
be rightly called an island of peace in a troubled sea 
the diamondrich nation maintains a westernstyle multiparty 
democracy in a region of oneparty blackruled states besides 
conflict over racial segregation in south africa southern africa 
is torn by guerrilla warfare and civil strife 
botswana has largely avoided involvement in these conflicts but 
south africa has made several raids against what it claims are 
guerrilla centers of the african national congress which is 
fighting to overthrow south africas government botswana has 
denied that it harbors guerrillas 
before the pope flew from zimbabwe for the second stop on his 
fivenation african tour vatican spokesman joaquim navarro said 
john paul had accepted invitations to visit madagascar and tanzania 
there has been speculation that john paul also would visit 
angola and possibly south africa on that trip expected next may 
navarro said neither country was on the program although he 
confirmed that angolan bishops had recently addressed an invitation 
to the pope 
on his current visit the pope has coupled condemnation of south 
africas apartheid policies with pleas for dialogue with south 
africa to solve regional problems 
according to navarro the vatican plays an active role in 
regional peacemaking efforts and sent french cardinal roger 
etchegarray a top aide to the region three times in the past 
year etchegarray met with officials of south africa angola and 
mozambique in may and presented them with a letter from john paul 
the pope concludes his tour with a visit to mozambique on 
saturday mozambique national resistance guerrillas in a statement 
issued in lisbon portugal said they would declare a unilateral 
ceasefire around the mozambican cities the pope will visit 
maputo beira and nampula 
but navarro stopped short of claiming a mediation role for the 
vatican 
the role of the holy see in affairs of the region is not and 
doesnt want to be a mediation role in the diplomatic sense of the 
word navarro told reporters it wants to create a climate in 
which dialogue can be possible 
john paul was scheduled to meet botswana president quett masire 
and give a mass at the national stadium in gaborone during a visit 
of less than 24 hours the expected crowd of 50000 at the stadium 
would be larger than the number of roman catholic church members in 
the country about 45000 
the pontiff was scheduled to leave wednesday morning for the 
mountain kingdom of lesotho where thousands of pilgrims from south 
africa were expected to attend ceremonies 
during a threeday visit to zimbabwe the pope appealed for 
reconciliation and human rights and for an end to racial and 
tribal discrimination he celebrated two masses held a rally of 
more than 30000 young people talked with diplomats and met 
catholic bishops and other christian leaders from the region

christian militiamen kidnapped defense 
minister adel osseiran on beiruts dividing green line today but 
freed him after the army threatened to move against them police 
said 
osseiran a shiite moslem was released in christian east beirut 
this afternoon and was on his way to the western moslem sector of 
the capital a police spokesman said the spokesman cannot be named 
under standing regulation 
the warning by army commander gen michel aoun a christian 
came an hour after gunmen of the lebanese forces the christians 
main militia seized osseiran 83 near beiruts dividing green 
line and took him to their seaside headquarters police reported 
the lebanese forces command denied it was holding osseiran it 
said in a statement that the militias security apparatus has been 
put on alert with orders to search every corner of east beirut 
for osseiran 
but the police spokesman said the militia command had initially 
offered to swap osseiran for christian parliament member farid 
serhal who it said had been kidnapped in west beirut on thursday 
the lebanese forces are the christians main militia 
the police spokesman said aoun has long been at odds with the 
lebanese forces over their growing dominance of a state within 
the state in east beirut and the christian heartland north of the 
capital that has eroded the authority of lebanons divided 
government 
the general simply cannot tolerate the abduction of his own 
chief the defense minister in an area that is supposed to be 
under direct army control the spokesman said 
the lebanese forces have claimed that serhal a maronite 
catholic was kidnapped by prosyrian militiamen of druse warlord 
walid jumblatts progressive socialist party at a checkpoint south 
of beirut last thursday as he was driving to jezzine 
the christians claimed he was was being kept at the bristol 
hotel in west beirut against his will 
the bristol acknowledged that serhal has been staying there 
incommunicado since thursday 
osseirans kidnapping heightened tension between christians and 
moslems amid a political deadlock in efforts to elect a new 
president the political wrangling has raised fears it could 
rekindle lebanons 13yearold civil war 
police said osseirans kidnappers made the demand for serhals 
return in a telephone call to the office of acting prime minister 
salim hoss a sunni moslem in west beirut 
the spokesman said the christian militiamen stopped osseirans 
black limousine at a lebanese forces checkpoint on the east side of 
the green line 
two militiamen entered the car and drove with the defense 
minister to the lebanese forces headquarters the spokesman added 
osseiran was kidnapped a few hundred yards from a sitin by 
serhals supporters to demand his return 
return deputy serhal the protesters chanted as the sitin 
blocked traffic across the nearby museum crossing which links the 
two sections of beirut 
serhal was among christian legislators who boycotted a 
parliamentary session called aug 18 to elect a new president 
because they opposed the candidacy of suleiman franjieh a former 
president who is backed by syria 
the session foundered because not enough legislators turned up 
to form the required quorum franjieh president from 1970 to 1976 
was the only serious candidate 
franjiehs followers accused the lebanese forces of forecefully 
preventing deputies from showing up at the session 
osseirans son ali was kidnapped in west beirut on june 17 
1987 with american journalist charles glass and their driver ali 
osseiran and the driver were freed that june 24 and glass escaped 
aug 17 1987

nbc officials have asked olympic advertisers to 
allow silent live coverage of certain events to continue during 
commercials in a corner of the television screen according to a 
report published today 
nbc sports executive producer michael weisman confirmed that the 
plan had been presented to certain advertisers and said some have 
indicated interest the daily news reported 
under the plan unprecedented in olympic coverage nbc would 
superimpose a silent picture in the lowerrighthand corner of the 
television screen during commercials in sports such as basketball 
volleyball cycling and longdistance track events the sport would 
occupy onequarter of the television screen 
nbc is hoping to avoid the harsh viewer criticism abc was 
subjected to during this years winter olympics when goals were 
scored during commercial breaks of hockey telecasts nbc has 
experimented with the technique during telecasts of majorleague 
baseball games 
some of these athletes have worked a lifetime to get to the 
olympics said weisman speaking from seoul where the olympics 
begin later this week it would be a shame if a great performance 
wasnt seen by the home folks because we were in a commercial 
break 
advertisers are paying nbc up to 330000 for a 30second 
commercial 
weisman said advertisers should consider the goodwill value 
of consenting to the proposal 
viewers will appreciate the gesture and so will the 
athletes he said

former white house adviser john d ehrlichman 
said today that frederic v malek took a bum rap in resigning 
from the republican national committee because of alleged 
antisemitism while he worked for president nixon 
in searching out what a white house memo described as a possible 
jewish cabal in the bureau of labor statistics in 1971 malek 
was simply carrying out orders from a nixon who was simply 
venting spleen ehrlichman said on the cbstv this morning 
program 
malek had been named deputy gop chairman by republican 
presidential nominee george bush but resigned sunday when the 
washington post reported he had compiled a list of senior jewish 
officials in the bureau of labor statistics on nixons orders 
nixon thought the labor department agency was reporting 
unemployment statistics with an unfavorable slant two jewish 
officials subsequently were demoted 
when all of the facts are looked at i think its a bum rap 
said ehrlichman who was nixons chief domestic policy adviser 
ehrlichman said the phrase jewish cabal written in the 
margin of a memorandum was straight vintage richard nixon 
this thing jewish cabal and all of that is kind of pure 
nixon venting spleen ehrlichman said most people on the staff 
really didnt pay any attention to that they didnt do anything 
about it and those things kind of blew over as kind of rhetorical 
excess 
ehrlichman said it was extremely unfair to malek who is 
the farthest thing from a bigot of anybody i know 
if you recognize it for what it is which is a fellow back 17 
years ago doing something the president of the united states 
instructed him to do and he had no discretion in doing i think it 
ought to just go away he said 
malek said in a statement sunday that he resigned to keep the 
bush campaign focused on the issues he admitted compiling data for 
former white house chief of staff hr haldeman but denied he had 
a role in any demotions 
bush strongly defended malek and denied that he was prejudiced

a federal judge refused to lift the suspension 
of a georgia southwestern college professor saying academic 
freedom was no excuse to make a racial remark 
if academic freedom or tenure gives one the right to use 
expressions in public that are patently offensive to a particular 
group then quite possibly the boundaries of proper conduct 
should be redrawn said us district judge duross fitzpatrick 
fitzpatrick also said in mondays rejection of a suit by allen 
towery that issuing an injunction in favor of the professor could 
inflame racial feelings at the college 
towery a tenured associate professor of english was suspended 
with pay in march after calling freshman ginevra dennis of atlanta 
a black bitch 
he admitted making the remark but said miss dennis had provoked 
him when the two argued over her request to withdraw from his class 
with a passing grade 
towery said monday evening of fitzpatricks ruling who could 
be happy with this theres not really anything else i can say 
miss dennis said she was relieved i thought he might be able 
to return even though he had been suspended 
she said she still believes towery should have been fired 
after a hearing in june a faculty committee recommended that 
towery be allowed to teach again during fall quarter georgia 
southwestern president william h capitan overruled the committee 
last month and suspended towery without pay for the quarter 
towery 50 then filed a lawsuit charging his suspension without 
pay was a violation of due process and that his career reputation 
and finances have suffered the suit asked 250000 in damages 
towery argued in a hearing his constitutional right of due 
process had been violated when capitan overruled the committee 
capitan said he based his decision in part on evidence not 
presented to the committee 
capitan testified that his work to relieve racial tensions on 
campus would be difficult if the professor returned to the 
classroom this month 
in his ruling the judge said that towery showed a lack of 
discipline when he used a particularly egregious expression in the 
presence of a young black woman whatever the provocation

a freighter carrying a cargo of 
beer sank in the north sea today off the dutch coast and all nine 
crew members were rescued from life rafts a coast guard spokesman 
said 
the ship sank at about 1245 pm in high winds some 28 
nautical miles north of the island of ameland 
it was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 
miles off the dutch island of ameland according to the coast guard 
spokesman who was not identified there were no casualties he 
said 
the coast guard official who spoke in a dutch radio interview 
identified the ship involved as the finnishregistered freighter ra 
and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer he did not give the 
ships origin or destination 
the nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking 
in high winds they were taken ashore by a west german helicopter 
from the island of borkum about 30 miles from the site of the 
sinking the official said 
a dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the 
scene 
earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry 
possibly one of the dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes 
between the coastal islands and the dutch mainland 
freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its 
vicinity to the ports of delfzijl in the netherlands and emden in

the problem of residential radon contamination 
appears to be more widespread than previously believed and serious 
enough to warrant testing for the deadly gas in every home 
nationwide the head of the environmental protection agency said 
today 
new surveys show particularly high levels of the invisible 
odorless gas in minnesota north dakota and pennsylvania the 
average home in those states contains radon above the epas 
guidelines according to figures released monday at a joint news 
conference of epa and the public health service 
discussing the findings on the abctvs good morning 
america epa administrator lee m thomas said the agency had 
believed radon was a major problem for several years but what 
this information shows us is that it is a problem in many states 
more states than we had thought in addition the estimates of 
concentrations are a little higher than we had thought 
epa has estimated radoncaused lung cancers could be killing 
20000 people out of the nations annual toll of 130000 lung 
cancer deaths 
and though epa hasnt changed its estimate that 10 percent of 
some 80 million homes have radon above the guidelines the new 
surveys in seven states and on indian lands in two more showed more 
than 29 percent of all homes above the guidelines 
combined with the results of 10 states surveyed last year that 
means one home in four of the 12 million in the two surveys was 
above the agencys guideline of 4 picocuries per liter said rich 
guimond head of epas radiation office 
we think weve documented the problem enough to recommend that 
every home be tested thomas told the news conference 
even if we are off by a factor of 10 the problem is severe 
enough so that we ought to do something about it said vernon 
houk assistant surgeon general attending the news conference to 
announce a formal public health advisory calling for radon testing 
houk said the health toll from radon probably exceeds by 10 
times outdoor air pollution and physicians should learn about it 
to advise their patients 
radon is a radioactive gas produced in the decay of uranium 
found in all soil and rock in at least trace amounts and present 
in the outdoor atmosphere normally at a concentration about 05 
percent of epas 4 picocurie action level homes tend to 
concentrate radon indoors 
radon kills by leaving its own radioactive decay products in the 
lung irradiating the tissues for a lifetime smoking itself the 
major cause of lung cancer increases the effectiveness of radon by 
15 times houk said 
if you have any detectable radon in your home dont permit 
smoking indoors houk said 
we have not characterized 4 picocuries as safe thomas 
noted and the agency is studying the adoption of using outdoor 
background levels as a goal for indoor programs at 4 picocuries 
epa believes a lifetime resident increases his or her chance of 
lung cancer by about 1 percent a risk level larger than any the 
agency tolerates in its other programs 
this extra risk is about equivalent to smoking half a pack of 
cigarettes per day guimond said 
epa has certified that about 1000 companies are qualified to 
test for radon and the test can be done for as little as 10 
thomas said 
the first thing someone confronted with an abnormal result 
should do is get it confirmed not unlike a lot of other things 
when you go to see your physician houk said 
if action is needed a majority of homes probably can be fixed 
for less than 1000 thomas said 
what can be done depends on the house some homes might require 
a simple sealing of cracks in basement walls others might require 
complicated systems to draw air from beneath basement slabs and 
discharge it outdoors still others might be cured by better 
ventilation stepping up the exchange of indoor and outdoor air 
houk noted that most mortgage lenders require homes to be 
checked for termites and said it is time to certify that our 
homes are free from radon when sold 
in minnesota and north dakota the survey identified an area 
similar in severity to the reading prong a wellknown narrow 
area of highuranium soils extending from about reading pa 
across northern new jersey into new york 
below is a list of the states surveyed after each state is the 
percentage of homes above 4 picocuries per liter and then the 
average concentration in that state surveys were designed to be 
statistically sound and the agency said there was a 95 percent 
chance the true percentages would be within 3 percentage points of 
the percentages given 
arizona 7 percent 16 picocuries per liter indiana 26 
percent 36 massachusetts 24 percent 34 minnesota 46 
percent 48 missouri 18 percent 26 pennsylvania 37 percent 
62 north dakota 63 percent 70 indian reservations in 
minnesota wisconsin and michigan 20 percent 29 
states surveyed last year were alabama colorado connecticut 
kansas kentucky michigan rhode island tennessee wisconsin and 
wyoming surveys are planned next year in alaska iowa maine new 
mexico ohio vermont west virginia and indian lands in new 
mexico colorado north dakota south dakota and iowa

the white house is turning on some 
electionyear rose garden charm to celebrate president reagans 
signing of a bill that strengthens the governments power to combat 
housing discrimination 
some 100 congressional leaders cabinet officers and other 
administration 
officials were scheduled to gather today at the white house to 
witness the presidential signing ceremony 
the effort is seen as a boon to the white house aspirations of 
vice president george bush whose staff was described as helping 
forge a compromise on the measure 
but members of both parties however had rushed to become 
cosponsors of the measure after the president signaled his 
willingness to sign it into law 
the original fair housing law passed in 1968 after the 
assassination of martin luther king jr gave the federal 
government only a mediation role in settling housing disputes 
under the new law the secretary of housing and urban 
development is empowered to go to court to seek stiff fines against 
property owners accused of discrimination 
the bill received final congressional approval in early august 
before reagan left on his traditional threeweek summer vacation 
however the legislations transfer to the white house was delayed 
so that a signing ceremony could be held after reagans return to 
washington last week 
the measure gives the federal government its first significant 
powers to combate housing discrimination 
the handicapped and families with children under 18 would be 
protected for the first time from housing discrimination the 
current law covered discrimination against racial minorities and 
legislation signed into law in 1974 barred discrimination on the 
basis of sex 
sen arlen specter rpa a chief sponsor hailed the new 
legislation as giving the government a tough remedy against 
housing discrimination 
specter credited bushs staff with being very active in 
negotiating compromise language that helped bring the bill to the 
floor 
other primary sponsors of the bill included sen edward kennedy 
dmass and rep hamilton fish rny 
opponents of the measure such as sen steve symms ridaho 
had criticized the measure as unfair housing bill contending 
it intruded on property rights and increased costs due to 
accessibility requirements for the handicapped and disabled 
other major provisions of the bill include 
the secretary of housing and urban development would try to win 
a conciliation agreement after a complaint is filed if that effort 
fails the secretary or any party could take the case to an 
independent administrative law judge in hud or to us district 
court 
if the administrative judge finds that someone has engaged or 
is about to engage in a discriminatory practice he shall order 
appropriate relief which may include actual damages an injunction 
or civil penalties 
the maximum fines would be 10000 for a first violation 
25000 for a second violation in a fiveyear period and 50000 
for two or more violations within a sevenyear period 
new buildings with four or more units must be constructed to 
they are readily accessible to the handicapped doors must be wide 
enough to accommodate wheelchairs switches and outlets must be in 
accessible locations bathroom walls must be reinforced to allow 
later installation of grab bars this would apply to dwellings set 
for occupancy 30 months after the laws enactment 
children could be barred from housing intended for the elderly 
such housing is defined as a community where at least 80 percent of 
the dwellings are occupied by at least one person age 55 or older 
and significant facilities and services are provided or those 
occupied solely by people age 62 and older

after gorbachev told workers at a synthetic fiber factory that 
the ruling politburo he heads was asked to turn special attention 
to a shortage of kindergartens a voice rang out 
we have kindergartens we dont have housing and the medical 
facilities are bad the tass news agency quoted one worker as 
shouting to gorbachev at the khimvolokno plant in the siberian city 
of krasnoyarsk 
on monday gorbachev heard similar complaints when he stopped in 
a tiny village yemelyanovo on his way to kransoyarsk from the 
airport to which he had flown from moscow 
we have no hot water you do what you can to wash one man 
shouted at the 57yearold communist party chief 
usually soviet citizens politely praise gorbachev and his 
policies or ask mild questions when he stops for chats as he tours 
the vast country but gorbachev came back from a sixweek vacation 
to a streetside discussion in yemelyanovo and at the krasnoyarsk 
factory filled with complaints about food and living conditions 
the evening television news program vremya led its monday 
evening program with a report of about 20 minutes on gorbachevs 
trip to the city about 2000 miles east of moscow it included the 
acrimonious exchange in yemeleyanovo 
as a crowd pressed closer and closer to gorbachev and his wife 
raisa shouting complaints and questions the general secretary cut 
in ok comrades i got caught your drift 
the soviet leader blamed local and national officials for 
failing to develop social services in krasnoyarsk and reiterated 
that he is committed to providing each soviet family with a 
separate apartment by the year 2000 
but some in the crowd were not satisfied 
there will never be that said one man apparently referring 
to the planned individual housing 
another man doubted the discussion would be covered by the 
officially controlled media 
mikhail sergeyevich will everything be shown on television or 
will half be cut out 
all of it will be shown the soviet leader responded 
one of the most vocal of the crowd members a blondhaired man 
in his 20s began the complaints by shouting about poor management 
of a local grain storage facility 
gorbachev asked for support for his reform policies as residents 
complained about long lines for meat sausage and other foods as 
well as a lack of hot water 
the most important thing is that you believe in our politics 
and in the leadership that is still being formed its still being 
formed at the regional and provincial levels gorbachev said 
he told the group that he was not interested in blind faith but 
in reasoned trust for his policies and the people implementing them 
were on the right path comrades he said no need to get 
lost were on the right path 
today gorbachev stopped at khimvolokno which tass said was a 
factory key to improving the supply and quality of consumer goods 
the plant is now under reconstruction because it as well as 
associated facilities are old 
social development has chronically lagged housing schools 
and hospitals now we must together restore that which we lost 
during those long years tass quoted gorbachev as saying 
tass said gorbachev would stay in the krasnoyarsk region which 
occupies onetenth of the soviet union until the end of the week 
krasnoyarsk also is the site of a soviet radar station that the 
united states says is an obstacle to arms control negotiations 
gorbachev did not discuss the radar site in comments distributed by 
the tass news agency and shown on soviet television 
he had been out of public view since july 30 when he met with 
the west german foreign minister soviet officials said he had been 
on vacation

the flight engineer of twa jet 
hijacked in 1985 testified today that mohammed ali hamadi 
joyfully pointed to the blood of a murdered us hostage and 
indicated his death was a great victory for the hijackers cause 
flight engineer benjamin zimmermann said the hijackers beat him 
and passengers after the athens to rome flight was seized june 14 
1985 he said he was kicked and pistolwhipped 
i would be hit on the side of the head with the gun butt when 
i would bend forward the blows would go down my back zimmermann 
testified 
the arab hijackers forced the jetliner to fly to beirut and held 
39 americans hostage for 17 days us navy diver robert stethem 
was shot and killed during the ordeal during the hijacking the 
jet first flew to beirut then to algeria and then back to beirut 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is on trial on charges of air 
piracy and murder 
zimmermann of cascade idaho said hamadi proudly pointed to 
stethems blood on the jets fuselage as he and hamadi walked 
around the plane when it landed in algiers from beirut 
when we went around the front the nose of the airplane mr 
hamadi joyfully pointed to the blood running down the door and 
with the pistol he pointed he indicated he was very proud of 
this gun and of him having caused this zimmermann testified 
he seemed to be demonstrating that he was capable of being a 
worthy soldier of the cause for some revolution zimmermann added 
zimmermann did not describe the cause however hamadi testified 
earlier in the trial his cause was the fight against israel and 
its allies including the united states the hijackers had 
demanded the release of shiite moslems held by israel 
after the hijacking israel freed 700 lebanese mostly moslems 
from prison camps in israel 
under questioning from chief judge reiner mueckenberger 
zimmermann said he was absolutely certain about the events that 
occurred outside the plane 
the judge indicated hamadi denied the incident took place 
zimmermann said the flight crew tried to keep the plane in 
algiers for as long as possible he said that as part of a stalling 
action he and hamadi left the plane to inspect the engines 
unfortunately i couldnt find anything wrong with airplane 
at least nothing noticeable to mr hamadi zimmermann said 
zimmermann said he was stunned by hamadis behavior as they 
observed the blood 
i wondered how he expected me to respond to him it was as if 
he wanted congratulations it seemed to be a great moment to him 
what that blood represented to him zimmermann said 
he also described the events that led up to stethems shooting 
zimmermann said that when negotiations for fuel with the tower 
in beirut went too slowly hamadi shouted get up get up to 
stethem 
the flight engineer said both hijackers then left the cockpit 
i heard a pop i heard someone exhale very loudly i heard it 
above the engine noises the shock of that noise was added to by 
the copilot on the radio stating that we needed fuel because they 
were killing passengers zimmermann testified 
the twa pilot john testrake testified monday that he believed 
hamadi shot stethem because the defendant seemed to enjoy violence 
the pilot said he did not see hamadi pull the trigger and said both 
hijackers may have been with stethem when the american was killed 
hamadi has admitted being one of the hijackers but has denied 
killing stethem 
also today mueckenberger expressed relief that a west german 
businessman was released monday after 20 months of captivity in 
lebanon 
i am extremely relieved that mr rudolf cordes has been 
released the judge said this happy news means an end to 
endless speculation about what influence cordes captivity would 
have on these proceedings 
mueckenberger said outside elements had never influenced the 
court adding it is not the job of the court to conduct 
diplomacy 
cordes and another west german alfred schmidt were kidnapped 
in beirut in january 1987 in the week after hamadi was arrested at 
frankfurt airport with explosives in his luggage 
hamads older brother abbas hamadi was convicted by a 
duesseldorf court of helping kidnap schmidt and cordes in a bid to 
free his brother 
schmidt was released sept 7 1987 in what his kidnappers said 
was a good will gesture 
in beirut cordes proiranian captors said his release was 
linked to mohammed hamadi in a statement the captors said that if 
hamadis release cannot be gained legally then we shall be 
obliged to again resort to violence

us ambassador to the united nations vernon a 
walters today called for an un investigation of iraqs alleged 
use of chemical weapons against ethnic kurds 
in london the british foreign office joined the us call 
asking the united nations to send a team to iraq to look into 
allegations that gas was used against the kurds most of whom live 
in northern iran and iraq and eastern turkey 
herbert s okun the secondranking diplomat at the us mission 
to the united nations met monday with secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar to make the request a spokeswoman for the us 
mission said today in new york 
okun acted on behalf of the united states britain japan and 
west germany said the spokeswoman who requested anonymity 
walters said the united states is extremely concerned about 
chemical warfare and backed a recent unanimous resolution by the 
un security council condemning its use 
we now have a case before us in the use of chemical warfare by 
the iraqis against the kurds and i believe that we will have to 
ask the un secretarygeneral to investigate this as he 
investigated the previous allegations against iraq 
the united states is determined that the use of chemical 
warfare will not become an accepted part of regional conflicts it 
is a danger in its own way as great as nuclear warfare and we 
intend to stop the proliferation of chemical warfare 
the british foreign office said it toughened its stand monday 
partly because of us state department evidence of such attacks 
which led the senate on friday to vote for tough economic sanctions 
against iraq 
the measure still must be approved by the house and signed by 
president reagan 
iraq has denied the charges 
british official sources have acknowledged a reluctance by 
britain and other western european countries to accuse iraq for 
fear they said of upsetting the delicate ceasefire in the 
8yearold war between iran and iraq 
the british foreign office maintained monday it had altered its 
stance also because of other evidence including reports from 
western journalists in turkey where thousands of iraqi kurds many 
suffering chemical injuries have fled 
the kurds claim iraq used the chemical weapons as part of a 
bloody offensive against the kurds who are seeking autonomy from 
iraq 
about 60000 kurds recently fled iraq to turkey citing poison 
gas attacks 
in tunis tunisia today the arab league said charges that iraq 
has used chemical weapons were fallacious and marked 
unwarranted interference in iraqs internal affairs 
in a statement issued at its headquarters the organization 
denounced what it called an israeliamerican media campaign 
against iraq 
in cairo meanwhile egypt criticized the senate sanctions 
which a foreign ministry official contended were groundless the 
official cited a turkish anatolia news agency report claiming there 
was no case proving iraq used these banned weapons 
turkey said friday no evidence of the use of chemical weapons 
was found while screening sick and injured refugees 
walters is touring asia to discuss issues to come up at the 43rd 
session of the un general assembly to convene in new york on 
sept 20 
he is leaving on wednesday for mongolia on the first visit ever 
by a member of the us cabinet to that landlocked sovietbloc 
country 
walters said he would meet the foreign minister and other senior 
officials during his oneday visit to ulan bator the capital of 
mongolia 
the united states and mongolia established diplomatic relations 
in january 1987 
while in china walters met with vice premier wu xueqian and 
foreign minister qian qichen after visiting mongolia he is to fly 
to south korea where he will be chief of the us delegation to 
the summer olympic games in seoul

released 775 iraqi war prisoners since the unsponsored 
ceasefire went into effect aug 20

democrat michael dukakis and republican george 
bush are running neck and neck in a pair of newly released national 
polls 
a cnnusa today survey of 1260 certain voters released monday 
found 48 percent preferred bush compared with 46 percent who 
favored dukakis but the margin of error of 3 percentage points 
negates the gop lead 
a second poll conducted sept 810 by the roper organization 
gave dukakis the lead 49 percent to 43 percent once again the 5 
percent margin of error meant the lead could fall either way 
the roper poll done for maryland public television and released 
monday night surveyed 619 likely voters nationwide 
the cnnusa today poll conducted last week by the gordon black 
corporation also suggested that the gender gap has narrowed 
considerably with women opting for dukakis over bush by a 4745 
margin fiftyone percent of men polled preferred bush however 
compared with 45 percent for dukakis 
bushs choice of dan quayle for his vice presidential nominee 
hurt him among swing voters and independents according to the 
poll but left republicans unswayed as a whole 
another group receiving considerable attention this year reagan 
democrats gave bush a slight edge over dukakis 5043 percent but 
negative voting seemed to favor dukakis with 34 percent of dukakis 
supporters voting against bush and 20 percent of bush backers 
saying they were in effect voting against dukakis 
the poll concluded that swing voters will have a substantial 
impact on the outcome of the presidential election 
it hinted at soft support among voters on both sides with one 
in six backing either candidate saying the other could do something 
to change their minds a full fifth of those questioned said they 
werent very committed to either candidate or had not decided who 
to vote for

republican george bush today promised a new era 
of individual economic empowerment and urged voters to reject 
democrat michael dukakis vision of an america shackled to the 
mistakes of the past 
the vice president criticized prophets of pessimism who he 
accused of ignoring the fruits of eight years of president reagans 
economic policies lower interest rates and inflation and creation 
of nearly 18 million jobs since 1982 
americans at every income level are certifiably better off 
than they were in 1981 bush told the executives club of 
chicago so the next time somebody tells you that america is 
declining tell em to put away the 1980 calendar this is 1988 
america is a rising nation again 
the gop nominee offered a flexible freeze on government 
spending without any tax increases and borrowing a phrase from 
former democratic presidential contender jesse jackson economic 
empowerment for the individual rather than government controls 
the strength of our economy comes from the people not from 
the government from the creativity and initiative of the 
individual not from official directives fiveyear plans and 
socalled industrial policies he said 
lets remember that today when the prophets of pessimism are 
again heard in the land the jobs say the pessimists theyre not 
good enough the trends say the pessimists theyre worrisome the 
international competition say the pessimists its too tough 
bush said 
he accused dukakis of espousing a big government philosophy that 
will lead to a growing bureaucracy less competitive industry and 
an america shackled to the mistakes of the past 
bush said dukakis is on a magical mystery tour promising to 
create a fund to rebuild america with a helping hand from 
washington 
but the vice president said this helping hand is reaching right 
for the voters wallets 
what will pay for that helping hand your money and who is 
being helped not you bush said 
this isnt a helping hand he said this is the same old 
heavy hand of government 
bush set the tone for todays speech during appearances smonday 
at a hispanicowned food plant in secaucus nj and a rally at an 
alton ill shopping center 
touring the goya foods plant bush told 100 employees that 
hispanic workers have been some of the biggest winners in 
americas economic comeback with their jobs increasing at three 
times the rate of the entire us labor force 
at the shopping center bush attacked the democratic 
presidential nominee for suggesting that the vice president was 
emulating the late joseph r mccarthy the inquisitorial 
anticommunist senator who questioned the patriotism of many 
americans in the 1950s 
at the same time bush suggested that he was a friend of the 
people and implied that dukakis wasnt 
he suggested that when i said hes a cardcarrying member of 
the american civil liberties union that that was mccarthyism 
bush told a crowd of about 7000 supporters 
dukakis actually used the term in reference to bushs attack on 
him for refusing to require teachers to lead their classes in the 
pledge of allegiance 
bush referred to an aug 17 new york magazine article that 
quoted dukakis saying he was a cardcarrying member of the aclu 
he said that not me bush said heatedly i am for the 
people hes that he says hes that 
i am the vice president of the united states of america a 
partner in an administration that has turned this economy around 
that has put america back to work that has strengthened our 
national security and that has enhanced the peace 
earlier monday the bush campaign announced the resignations of 
five members of his american nationalities coalition an ethnic 
outreach panel made up of volunteer advisers a newspaper 
washington jewish week reported last week that a handful of the 
groups 88 members had ties to antisemitic nazi or other fascist 
organizations or were blocking the prosecution of suspected nazi 
war criminals 
bush told reporters in alton that the campaign conducted a 
review of allegations made in the newspaper and we were unable to 
substantiate any of them 
nonetheless he said these individuals have done the right 
thing by removing themselves from the controversy and any further 
use by political opponents 
he said the five had left voluntarily and added with visible 
annoyance that the campaign were getting into a very peculiar 
deal where some people are accusing people i dont like it a bit 
those who resigned were philip guarino laszlo pastor florian 
galdau ignatius bilinsky and bohdon fedorak 
the resignations follow the departure last week of coalition 
member jerome brentar who had been an active supprter of john 
demjanjuk the former ohio autoworker who was extradited and 
convicted in israel of being a nazi war criminal 
on sunday frederic v malek resigned as the bushappointed 
deputy chairman of the republican national committee after 
acknowledging a newspaper report that while serving in the nixon 
administration he tallied the number of jews in a federal agency

after nearly two weeks of strikes but officials said it would take 
as many weeks to deliver a backlog of 150 million letters and 
packages 
the strike ended monday night after the union of communication 
workers reached an agreement with post office officials the two 
sides said they established a framework for further talks on 
differences over pay bonuses overtime compensation and the hiring 
of temporary staff 
the union which represents the 140000 post office employees 
involved in the dispute said it hoped all workers would be back at 
work by thursday 
about 1700 workers returned to post offices by midmorning 
today while more than 98000 other strikers continued negotiations 
garner said 
she said workers are on their jobs at tonbridge and sevenoaks 
both southeast of london and in other small offices around the 
country 
public mailboxes that were sealed during the dispute will be 
opened gradually she said 
post office officials said international mail and firstclass 
letters and parcels will receive priority as the backlog of mail is 
cleared over the next two weeks 
about half of britains 1500 post offices were closed during 
the strike and only one of the 82 major mail sorting centers in 
belfast northern ireland remained open during the strike 
post office spokeswoman jane garner said the agreement condones 
the use of temporary staff reasonable levels of overtime pay 
and some diversions of mail to offices which can best handle 
it 
the post office wants to pay bonuses to new workers in london 
and southeast england where the cost of living is high and 
recruiting employees is difficult 
the union which demanded that the bonuses be paid to all 
employees or not at all called a series of strikes that began with 
a 24hour work stoppage aug 31

presidency said today in a speech to the executives club in 
chicago that the democrat supports a biggovernment philosophy that 
will leave america shackled to the mistakes of the past 
in his remarks bush embraced reagan principles of less 
government but also praised the idea of economic empowerment a 
phrase often used by jesse jackson a democrat generally considered 
more liberal than dukakis 
bush said that in addition to his stands against new taxes and 
in favor of a flexible freeze on government spending the 
third principle is economic empowerment the strength of our 
economy comes from the people not from the government from the 
creativity and initiative of the individual not from official 
directives fiveyear plans and socalled industrial policies 
dukakis in a speech to the chicago council on foreign relations 
today said yes it would be naive to take soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev at his word but it would be dangerous to allow 
his words to go unanswered and untested in the court of public 
opinion around the world 
he praised reagan for the progress his administration has made 
on nuclear arms control but said too often the armsreduction 
proposals came from the soviet union and he questioned whether 
bush or his running mate indiana sen dan quayle had the judgment 
and experience to negotiate with the soviets 
george bush has been around washington a long time but if he 
couldnt stand up to the ayatollah or say no to noriega how will 
he measure up to gorbachev dukakis asked 
meanwhile five members of bushs coalition of american 
nationalities resigned monday amid charges of ties to antisemitic 
organizations they said in a statement they were leaving because 
we have been attacked unfairly by george bushs political 
opponents 
the resignations come on the heels of frederic v maleks 
decision to leave his republican national committee post after a 
published report said he had compiled a list in 1971 of jews at the 
bureau of labor statistics bush had appointed malek to the rnc job 
the two presidential candidates were deadlocked in the latest 
public opinion poll a cable news networkusa today survey of 1260 
certain voters conducted last week by the gordon black corp 
found 48 percent favored the republican ticket while 46 percent 
preferred the democratic slate 
the margin of error of 3 percentage points makes the race a 
virtual dead heat 
a second poll conducted sept 810 by the roper organization 
gave dukakis the lead 49 percent to 43 percent once again the 5 
percent margin of error in either direction meant the lead was 
uncertain 
the roper poll done for maryland public television and released 
monday night surveyed 619 likely voters nationwide 
stepping up his offensive on monday dukakis issued an unusual 
promise to support the stealth bomber a pledge that appeared to 
go beyond the candidates previous statements that he supported 
continued research on the project 
that bomber was started by a democratic administration it was 
supported by the democrats in congress and its going to be 
completed under my administration dukakis told workers at a 
general electric plant in ohio 
the massachusetts governor encountered boos and chants of 
bush bush from the employees at the plant where engines for 
the radarevading aircraft are manufactured those booing were in 
the minority and dukakis speech was not interrupted 
at a shopping center rally in illinois bush repeated his charge 
that dukakis is a liberal democrat and cardcarrying member of 
the american civil liberties union terms the democratic nominee 
used to describe himself according to the vice president 
recently the governor of massachusetts accused me of 
mccarthyism bush said and it was suggested that when i said 
he is a cardcarrying member of the aclu that that was mccarthyism 
when i say hes a liberal thats unfair 
shouting until he was nearly hoarse bush said it was dukakis 
himself who said in iowa im a very strong democrat a liberal 
democrat a progressive democrat a cardcarrying member of 
the american civil liberties union 
at the rally bush did not directly respond to dukakis 
criticism that republicans were attacking his patriotism using the 
tactics of the latesen joseph r mccarthy 
earlier in the day however in a taped interview with the usa 
today television program bush was asked what question would he 
pose to dukakis and responded do you think the vice presidents 
impugned your patriotism were you serious when you suggested to 
this man whos been in public life for 30 years he is guilty of 
mccarthyism 
dukakis answering bush in a separate interview said oh sure 
he has you dont run around suggesting to people that a rival 
for the presidency of the united states is less committed to the 
pledge of allegiance and what it means without impugning his 
patriotism

michael dukakis said today he would welcome an 
expanded soviet role in world trade if the kremlin makes 
longawaited progress in guaranteeing human rights ending regional 
conflicts and halting weapons shipments to terrorist nations 
the democratic nominee promising a hardline approach on 
ussoviet relations also questioned whether republican 
candidates george bush and dan quayle are tough enough to deal with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
george bush has been around washington a long time but if he 
couldnt stand up to the ayatollah or say no to panamanian 
leader gen manuel antonio noriega how will he measure up to 
gorbachev dukakis asked 
and if he truly believes that j danforth quayle is qualified 
to be one heartbeat away from the presidency how can we trust his 
judgment when americas future is on the line 
dukakis said quayle paled in comparison to the three vice 
presidents who have become president since world war ii 
dan quayle is no gerald ford he said hes no lyndon 
johnson and he sure aint harry truman can we stake our future on 
the hope that he is a match for mikhail gorbachev 
dukakis told the chicago council on foreign relations that the 
next president must understand the obstacles that exist to an 
improved relationship with the soviet union but he must not be put 
off by them 
he added we must act not react if we are to regain and 
maintain the initiative in world affairs yes it would be naive to 
take gorbachev at his word but it would be dangerous to allow his 
words to go unanswered and untested in the court of public opinion 
around the world 
dukakis said soviet actions have fallen short of gorbachevs 
words in reforming soviet society 
he called on gorbachev to reduce the soviet advantage in 
conventional forces in europe and promised a democratic 
administrations cooperation in negotiating further cutbacks in 
nuclear weapons 
dukakis urged the soviets not only to help end conflicts in the 
middle east and nicaragua but to support trade unions and 
alternative political parties in eastern bloc nations 
we must constantly remind the soviets of the regional conflict 
they created in eastern europe a conflict that has resulted in 
totalitarian rule over six proud nations for more than 40 years 
he said 
while gorbachev has publicly promised to help curb terrorism 
the massachusetts governor assailed the soviets for supplying 
military and economic aid to syria libya and the palestinian 
liberation organization and providing nuclear missiles to other 
countries 
as president i will work with our allies to persuade mr 
gorbachev that if he wants to join the international economic 
community he must first get out of the business of exporting these 
weapons to volatile regions of the world dukakis said 
he also accused gorbachev of failing to deliver on his promise 
to improve human rights in the soviet union it is not enough to 
pretend that rights exist when they do not exist dukakis said 
we in america should stand ready to respond to progress with 
progress dukakis said but we must be ready to meet 
stubborness with determination deception with the truth and 
aggression with the full power of a strong and united democratic 
alliance 
it was dukakis first major policy speech on sovietamerican 
affairs and was part of a threeday campaign effort to counter 
bushs charges that dukakis was weak on defense and naive on 
foreign policy 
he began the counteroffensive monday with an overview of his 
views on national security in philadelphia and later by touring a 
general electric plant outside cincinnati he reiterated his 
support for the stealth bomber whose engines are made at the 
plant but nonetheless was periodically interrupted by booing bush 
supporters 
it was a good audience dukakis said after the cincinnati 
event during which he did not acknowledge his detractors it was 
fun thats democracy 
from chicago dukakis was heading to michigan to visit a plant 
where the m1 tank was designed the democratic nominee supports 
the tank program 
dukakis attacked bushs judgment in light of the resignation of 
five bush campaign officials amid published reports of their past 
ties with pronazi and antisemitic organizations 
i think it raises continuing questions about mr bushs 
judgment dukakis said 
dukakis whose own polls show uneasiness among critical swing 
voters with bushs selection of quayle also criticized the 
republican senator in his philadelphia speech he called bush a 
failed leader in the war on drugs and derided bushs promise to 
appoint quayle as his point man in the drug fight 
were going to put someone who is tough and aggressive and 
experienced in charge of the war against drugs dukakis said 
after praising his running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen dukakis 
spoke at a gathering of about 250 people in a philadelphia union 
hall

thirty percent of highachieving 
teenagers said they have considered committing suicide and 45 
percent said they knew someone who had killed themself or had tried 
to a new survey found 
the 19th annual survey of high achievers conducted by polling 
teenagers listed in the directory whos who among american high 
school students found that 4 percent said they had tried to 
commit suicide 
since the survey began tracking attitudes toward suicide among 
high achievers four years ago the percentage who reported knowing 
a teenager who had attempted or committed suicide has grown from 
40 percent to 45 percent 
the percentage who reported having personally considered suicide 
has been relatively stable rising from 28 percent to 30 percent 
over the fouryear period while the percentage who report trying 
to commit suicide went from 3 percent to 4 percent the 
organization said 
the problem may be especially serious among black high 
achievers the organization said in a news release 
the survey found that 10 percent of the black highachievers 
polled this year said they had attempted suicide the survey 
results were based on responses from 2024 students 5 percent of 
whom were black the whos who organization said 
on other issues the new whos who survey found that drug use 
continues dropping among the nations brightest high school 
students with less than 1 percent reporting they smoke marijuana 
more than once a month thats down from 4 percent five years ago 
and 11 percent a decade ago 
alcohol use also is decreasing with 63 percent of the 
teenagers surveyed saying they never drink alcohol compared to 50 
percent in 1978 and 48 percent in 1983

opposition leaders today rejected 
elections that would be organized by the countrys oneparty 
government and repeated their call for an interim government to 
supervise the vote

on a 48hour fast for democracy reviving a tactic used decades ago 
in the struggle for greater freedom from british colonial rule 
tens of thousands of people marched in the capital demanding the 
interim government they included striking government employees 
uniformed students and about 3000 uniformed doctors nurses and 
staff members of militry and other hospitals 
the demonstrations were smaller than those the day before 
after weeks of political turmoil many people in this city of 
35 million have begun eating rice porridge or gruel instead of 
pure rice because prices have skyrocketed due to growing shortages 
strikes by transportation workers and a lack of fuel have 
restricted supplies from the countryside and there has been 
hoarding by worried residents a 44pound bag of rice that cost 
the equivalent of 170 a month ago now costs 580

minister tin oo said in their meeting with the governmentappointed 
election commission that they will not support or take part in the 
elections and will continue pressing for an interim government

military coup announced saturday it will end 26 years of oneparty 
rule and hold elections as early as the end of october

the countrys rapidly deteriorating security situation aung gyi 
said later 
aung gyi said he told election commission chairman ba htay a 
retired financial commissioner under a pre1962 civilian government 
after 26 years of this rule most people in the country do not 
know you and will not have confidence more so people do not trust 
any governmentappointed commission 
like the other four elderly commission members ba htay is 
regarded as politically neutral 
the three opposition leaders were later joined by a fourth 
antigovernment figure former prime minister nu in a meeting with 
student rebel leaders the students asked them to immediately form 
an interim government but were told that was not possible without 
cooperation from the current government 
on monday aung gyi aung san suu kyi and tin oo signed their 
first joint statement a letter to president maung maung demanding 
the interim government photographs of them eating together and 
signing the statement received prominent display in private and

a 1500yearold tomb uncovered on the 
northern coast of peru has yielded one of the richest collections 
of crafted gold and artifacts ever found in the americas the 
national geographic society announced today 
the tomb officials said was the burial place for a 
warriorpriest of the moche people a civilization that dominated 
the peruvian area from 100 ad to about the end of the 7th century 
this is the richest tomb ever excavated archaeologically in 
the western hemisphere according to christopher b donnan an 
expert on ancient peru 
walter alva director of the bruning archaeological museum in 
lambayeque peru said that the area near the village of sipan may 
be the burial site for a succession of highranking moche leaders 
and that other tombs with more treasure may be found 
i am sure that when we finish digging here we will know more 
about the life social and economic organization the metallurgical 
knowledge and religious practices of the moche alva was quoted 
as saying in an announcement released by the national geographic 
society 
officials said the moche peoples dominated the peruvian area 
prior to the time of the inca civilization the incas were the most 
powerful group in the area at the time of the spanish conquest in 
the 1530s 
the moche tomb was discovered after authorities learned in 
january 1987 that a number of remarkably fine gold and silver 
artifacts were being sold on the black market in peru police 
raided the home of a tomb robber and after a shoot out that killed 
one person recovered some of the treasures 
information gathered from the raid led to the sipan area and the 
tomb was found after careful excavation 
among the treasures found were a crown mask knives and jewelry 
of gold along with more than 1000 ceramic and copper artifacts 
in addition to the warriorpriest the tomb also contained the 
remains of two women and three other men all apparently part of a 
ceremonial entombment ritual 
excavation of the tomb was financed by the national geographic 
society under the auspices of the peruvian government

oil futures prices which are trading near 
twoyear lows could stabilize at higher levels amid speculation 
that saudi arabia might take the lead in curbing opec production 
traders say 
on the new york mercantile exchange this morning prices for 
nearterm contracts of crude oil opened slightly higher than 
mondays closing prices 
crude futures prices had skidded below 14 a barrel monday but 
then surged higher in the final hour of trading after saudi king 
fahd called for joint cooperation between opec and nonopec 
producers in establishing production limits 
on the new york mercantile exchange the october contract for 
delivery of west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us 
crude was trading between 1450 and 1458 a 42gallon barrel in 
early trading today compared with mondays 1449 closing price 
before the late rally monday the contract had dropped to 1375 
the lowest level since oil traded for 1373 on oct 29 1986 
contracts for refined oil products also were trading higher this 
morning wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery ranged 
between 4290 cents and 4350 cents a gallon compared with 
mondays closing of 4262 cents the october wholesale heating oil 
contract ranged between 4180 cents a gallon and 4205 cents 
compared with mondays settlement price of 4168 cents 
fahds statement could indicate saudi arabia the worlds 
biggest crude exporter was moving to take a leadership role and 
lower its own oil production said george konikowski an analyst at 
smith barney harris upham amp co 
two years ago when oil prices hit similar lows saudi production 
curbs helped reverse the markets decline traders said 
if the king says he doesnt want the market to go much lower 
you would think the saudis would set some limits said peter 
beutel an energy analyst with elders futures inc it looks like 
prices are going to stabilize in this range 
mondays early selloff was fueled by anxieties about the 
continuing world oil glut 
analysts said fahds statement came as the market was looking 
for positive news following a string of negative indicators that 
had steadily eroded prices 
fahds statement reported by the official saudi press agency 
following a weekly government cabinet session had a strong impact 
on the market because the king rarely makes public statement 
related to the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
brokers said 
before the statement was released analysts had focused on the 
inability of opecs 13 members to keep within their production 
quotas despite the worldwide oversupply of oil 
after predicting prices could drop below 13 a barrel by weeks 
end some analysts reversed their position by the end of mondays 
session saying such an assessment was now overly pessimistic 
opec members are scheduled to meet in vienna austria nov 21 
as more oil floods the market refiners have taken advantage of 
the bargain rates to pad their inventories before winter analysts 
said normally refiners build up inventories during the summer 
months but with refineries near capacity the extra oil is going 
into storage rather than refining 
everyone thinks prices are probably at the lowest theyre 
going to see through the remainder of the year said ken miller 
senior principal and engineer at purvin amp gertz inc petroleum 
consulting firm in houston

president pw botha announced 
today that south africa will donate 3000 tons of corn to feed 
refugees in malawi as he completed his first summit trip into 
black africa in his 10 years in power 
bothas announcement followed private talks in mzuzu malawi 
with the countrys longserving president hastings kamuzu banda 
malawi is the only african state maintaining full diplomatic ties 
with south africa where whites dominate the government 
on monday botha had a 90minute private talk in northwestern 
mozambique with president joaquim chissano whose marxist 
government has accused south africa of supporting an 11yearold 
rebel insurgency 
botha gave assurances to mozambique that this support had ceased 
and invited chissano to south africa to continue talks on increased 
cooperation 
the refugees who are to receive the gift of corn in malawi are 
residents of mozambique who have fled the fighting there 
in mzuzu botha and banda issued a joint statement reaffirming 
the friendly relations between south africa and malawi both also 
said south africa would negotiate a rescheduling of malawis debt 
on terms agreeable to both parties 
banda believed to be almost 90 has ruled malawi in 
authoritarian style since independence from britain in 1964 
opposition political parties are banned and banda maintains 
personal control over most government ministries 
in mozambique botha and chissano agreed to work at reviving the 
1984 nkomati accord in which south africa pledged to withdraw 
support from guerrillas in return for controls on african national 
congress exiles based in mozambique 
mozambique repeatedly has accused south africa of breaking the 
agreement 
chissano spoke of mutual hopes to end regional conflicts and 
said we are ready to take this process as far as possible 
mozambique in the past has accused malawi of allowing the 
mozambican rebels to operate from its territory relations between 
the two countries have improved since malawi agreed last year to 
deploy troops in mozambique to help protect a railroad line against 
sabotage

the sister of americas longestheld 
hostage in lebanon says she is pushing for a united nations 
resolution condemning international kidnapping by extremist groups 
peggy say said during a news conference monday that her brother 
terry anderson will celebrate his 41st birthday oct 27 and she 
would like to see the resolution passed on that date 
anderson chief middle east correspondent of the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 by a proiranian group in 
moslem west beirut 
say said she and the journalists committee to free terry 
anderson are also attempting to arrange an appearance by former 
french hostages on the donahue television talk show 
say said she has deliberately been quiet in recent months since 
moving from batavia to kentucky hoping that the lack of media 
attention might bear some positive developments in her brothers 
release 
i have to believe the end is near say said it could be a 
logical assumption that he could be here by the end of the year 
prospects appear more promising because of negotiations to end the 
war between iran and iraq she said 
after his release by the islamic jihad earleir this year french 
national marcel fontaine met with say and told her of her brothers 
condition that meeting produced the last reliable information 
about anderson say said 
say said she believes the reagan administration has negotiated 
vigorously for the release of other american hostages such as 
during the hijacking of the twa jetliner to beirut in 1985 but 
not for anderson 
i dont see the administration doing anything now she said 
what were being told is to devalue these hostages

a committee that has been looking over nasas 
shoulder as the space shuttle booster rockets were redesigned said 
today it is satisfied no safety issues stand in the way of a launch 
late this month or early in october 
the report however disclosed for the first time that a crack 
had been found in a strut among stored booster parts and that the 
implications of the occurrence of this defect on the upcoming 
flight are being evaluated 
but the committee in a report to nasa administrator james c 
fletcher said we have no basis for objection to the current 
launch schedule for sts26 the next flight 
the report was submitted by h guyford stever chairman of the 
national research councils panel on the redesign of the shuttle 
booster rockets a leak in the joint between the bottom two of the 
four segments that make up the booster was blamed for the 
challenger disaster 
during the redesign activity two booster components were 
found to have structural safety factors that did not satisfy 
specifications the report said a redesigned aft skirt on the 
booster has failed to meet the ultimate design load condition 
required in the specifications the report said but will not 
affect flight safety 
the other problem is the cracked strut that was found among 
stored parts 
we understand that the struts installed in sts26 had been 
inspected in accordance with procedures and proof tested and that 
the implications of the occurrence of this defect for sts26 are 
being evaluated stever wrote 
top space agency managers are meeting at the kennedy space 
center in florida for a flight readiness review today and 
wednesday presumably this was an issue on the agenda 
the nrc committees report was the seventh since it was assigned 
the task of monitoring the shuttles return to flight but was not 
as critical as others have been 
the committee said the five design features thought to have 
contributed to the challenger explosion have been fixed but the 
panel said it was disappointed to learn of nasas moneysaving 
decision to evaluate the redesign with special instrumentation on 
only the first three flights 
while not every test that the panel and others might have 
desired was conducted before the return to flight it is clear that 
the current test program has been considerably more extensive and 
thorough than the test program that preceded the first shuttle 
launch the nrc said 
as a consequence we conclude that nasa can have 
commensurately more confidence in the redesigned srm solid rocket 
motor than it had in the original design

jim and tammy bakker and a former aide 
took money out of ptl and were indifferent to the ministrys 
financial woes a ptl attorney says 
in a us bankruptcy court hearing expected to last all week 
ptl representatives are trying to regain 52 million they contend 
the bakkers and former aide david taggart took through 
mismanagement of funds cash advances on ptl credit cards and 
unjustified compensation benefits and fees 
as the trial began monday ptl attorney brad leggett said the 
bakkers and taggart were uninterested in money problems while 
taking money out at times faster than it was coming in 
peter bailey an accountant and financial director at ptl from 
june 1979 through july 1987 testified he routinely warned bakker 
of financial troubles 
bailey testified today that he was continually frustrated by a 
lack of financial integrity on the part of bakker and other 
ministry executives memos regarding cost reductions and a limit of 
expenditures were either ignored or inadequately addressed he 
charged 
bakker lawyer ryan hovis told judge rufus reynolds who is 
hearing the case without a jury that the continuing financial 
crisis ptl experienced under bakkers leadership was not unusual 
every ministry of this type in the nation had the same type of 
financial crisis he said 
the bakkers and taggart were not in court monday or today but 
hovis told reporters he plans to call them as witnesses when it is 
time to present their case 
meanwhile bankruptcy trustee mc red benton filed papers 
in court saying he couldnt meet mondays deadline to recommend a 
buyer for the ministrys assets he asked for an extension until 
sept 27 to continue negotiations 
in court monday ptl lawyers maintained that the bakkers took 
huge personal bonuses while bills werent being paid and used 
money that was raised to build hotels as general operating funds 
entered into court records were numerous memos from bailey to 
bakker recommending such things as cutting expenses reducing 
payroll and using competitive bidding for construction jobs 
bailey said some staff members were hesitant to approach bakker 
with information about financial problems he bakker was out 
there planning and building and he had a saying he didnt want 
to hear any bad news bailey said 
ptl lawyers used internal documents to detail the ministrys 
problems from 19841987 they cited bonuses given to the bakkers 
and taggart at the same time the ministry was having serious 
financial problems

a third of american adults questioned in a 
recent survey said they personally know a teenager who either 
committed suicide or tried to according to a report released today 
a separate study of highachieving teenagers meanwhile 
disclosed that 30 percent said they have considered suicide and 45 
percent know someone who has tried it or succeeded 
the national survey of 1000 adults questioned by the national 
association of private psychiatric hospitals found that 27 percent 
of those questioned said they knew a teenager who had tried to 
kill themselves and 17 percent knew a teenager who had killed 
themselves 
charles riter of riter research the annapolis md company that

32 percent of those questioned knew a teenager in one of the two 
categories 
john e meeks a child psychiatrist and a professor at george 
washington university school of medicine in washington said the

modern teenagers face severe problems 
teenagers frequently worry that adults dont take their 
problems seriously meeks said at a news conference

a judge ruled that only limited 
discussion will be allowed in the jurys presence about the sexual 
history of a 19yearold woman whose complaint of a gang rape led 
to the indictment of 10 men on charges ranging from kidnapping to 
sexual assault 
after lengthy pretrial motions by defense attorneys jury 
selection finally began late monday and continued today in the 
sexual assault trial of orlando garza 23 the first of several 
scheduled as a result of the womans allegations 
state district judge ricardo garcia granted a prosecution motion 
to block references to the womans sexual history in the presence 
of the jury without first determining whether such discussion would 
be admissible evidence 
defense attorney albert pena protested that prior sexual 
behavior touches on the very basis of the defense of consent 
pena told the jury pool they would have to ignore the extensive 
media coverage the case has attracted since the 19yearold woman 
said she was abducted and gang raped march 26 
the woman told authorities she was abducted while walking home 
from a relatives house and raped over four hours by as many as 20 
men she said the attack began at a ranch north of town where a 
cockfight was being held and that her attackers urged men at the 
cockfight to join in some did despite her pleas of help she said 
ten men were indicted on various kidnapping or sexual assault 
charges a 14yearold youth also has been charged 
garza of san diego also faces a later trial on a charge of 
aggravated kidnapping 
the judge denied motions by the defense to replace the jury 
panel the defense had tried to show that an inordinate number of 
the potential jurors were relatives of one of the prosecutors and 
residents of areas the county where the prosecutors family has a 
historical political stronghold

britain expelled the cuban ambassador and another 
envoy today after the junior diplomat wounded one man when he fired 
a gun at people he believed were following him 
with a wry smile and a wave ambassador oscar fernandezmell was 
driven from his official residence in north london to catch a 
flight to prague czechoslovakia within the 24hour expulsion 
deadline set by british officials 
the ambassador accompanied by his wife and 12yearold son 
picked up another diplomat believed to be the gunman third 
secretary carlos manuel medina perez at the embassy en route to 
heathrow airport 
police said antiterrorist squad detectives had traced one man 
who was slightly injured in the monday afternoon shooting and added 
they were satisfied he was not posing a threat to anyone 
in a statement scotland yard police headquarters said it would 
not release the identify of the injured man adding the police 
inquiry into the shooting was closed 
speculation grew about the group that medina perez described as 
a commercial attache in the diplomatic list claimed was stalking 
him 
the british radio reports quoted the cuban foreign ministry as 
saying on havana radio that the expulsion was arbitrary and 
unjust and that medina perez was being followed by a cuban exile 
who had tried to get the diplomat to defect 
the daily mail said he believed he was being trailed by an 
assassination squad the daily express the group were members of 
britains mi5 counterintelligence agency who watch cuban 
diplomats round the clock 
it added that medina perez said he opened fire in panic because 
he thought the group were agents of the government of south africa 
which supports prowestern guerrillas who oppose the cubanbacked 
marxist government of angola 
the government acknowledged a shooting incident on monday but 
provided few details 
in london a cuban embassy spokesman in a radio interview said 
the british retaliation was excessive 
the foreign office in a statement retorted we have reacted 
appropriately to a totally unacceptable and outrageous action on 
the streets of london 
the foreign office said medina perez told police he fired 
because he was afraid for his safety the foreign office said he 
was released from police custody after he claimed diplomatic 
immunity 
foreign office minister timothy eggar summoned fernandezmell to 
the foreign office after the shooting and told the ambassador that 
he and medina perez who also held the embassy post of commercial 
attache were being expelled 
in a later statement eggar called the expulsions an 
indication of how strongly we feel we are not prepared to have 
this kind of behavior in the streets of london 
the daily mail reported said medina perez barricaded himself in 
the official cuban apartment after the incident it said two police 
officers negotiated with medina perez from an adjacent balcony 
press association said medina perez fired up to five shots at a 
car with four people inside it quoted an unidentified witness as 
saying she saw the four run away one holding a bloodsoaked 
handkerchief to his head 
british authorities refused comment on the news reports 
in a nation where ordinary police do not carry guns weapons 
possession by diplomats is a grave issue it became particularly 
sensitive after a gunman fired from the libyan embassy during a 
protest demonstration in april 1984 killing a british policewoman 
after a police siege the embassy was shut and diplomatic ties cut 
on sunday vietnamese third secretary khang than nhan left 
london expelled by britain after the vietnamese ambassador turned 
in a gun he said khang waved sept 4 during a demonstration by 
britishbased vietnamese refugees 
the vietnamese ambassador first handed over a toy gun but later 
returned with a real one and apologized the foreign office said

an outofcontrol wildfire zeroed 
in on hundreds of rural dwellings in the rugged sierra nevada today 
after leveling nearly 100 homes and forcing the evacuation of at 
least 8000 people 
the warm dry winds that drove the fire across 40 square miles 
of terrain covered with timber and brush continued this morning as 
sleepstarved firefighters struggled to hold their own against the 
70foothigh flames 
we probably have as extreme a condition as anywhere in 
california or anywhere in the us today said operations 
director ed waggoner of the state department of forestry 
at least 149 structures including 92 homes were destroyed in 
an area about 60 miles northeast of sacramento authorities said 
some of the homes were valued at 1 million 
fire officials stressed that many more houses are still in 
extreme danger especially rough and ready a community of about 
500 residents all evacuated in the heavily wooded bottom of a 
steep canyon on the edge of the fire 
fire planning chief steve iverson said saving rough and ready 
was one of the top priorities today but he cautioned that it was a 
particularly dangerous area for firefighters because of the limited 
access on a narrow road 
if we have shifty winds were not going to sit around in 
there iverson said 
a preliminary estimate by the us forest service put the loss 
in structures alone at more than 9 million and the figure was 
expected to climb much higher 
i was coming back from the bahamas sitting in san francisco 
international airport and i see my fathers house burning on 
television said insurance agent don sanzone 41 
jim mowner a state forestry spokesman said the continued stiff 
winds and low humidity were hampering firefighting 
i would say the fire will burn actively overnight he said 
early today 
before dawn mowners prediction was borne out as department of 
forestry officials reported that the fire had grown overnight from 
25 to 40 square miles 
the only good news mowner said was that the fire was spreading 
into an area east of beale air force base where there were fewer 
homes 
that could help us he said weve been spending an awful 
lot of time and manpower protecting structures so the main fire 
has been burning relatively freely 
more than 1000 firefighters had been added to the lines monday 
and today bringing the total to nearly 2800 battling the blaze 
said forestry department spokeswoman karen finlayson 
the blaze began early sunday when a transient set fire to toilet 
paper the unidentified man was cited for burning without a permit 
and released authorities said 
about 4500 residents of the affluent lake wildwood area were 
forced from their homes sunday and monday as erratic winds shifted 
the blaze at least 3500 people have been evacuated from the 
nearby communities of smartville rough and ready and penn valley 
since sunday 
two firefighters suffered second and thirddegree burns their 
conditions were not immediately available 
the fire jumped highway 20 and headed southwest on monday 
threatening hundreds of scattered rural dwellings and forcing the 
latest round of evacuations 
there are hundreds here and they are pouring in said red 
cross worker elizabeth quirk at the nevada union high school 
evacuation center the school buses are bringing in senior 
citizens and there are campers and motor homes in the parking 
lot 
most schools were closed in the region thick smoke made it 
unsafe to operate school buses and the red cross converted at 
least three schools into temporary evacuation centers 
by early today the fire had burned an estimated 25000 acres 
or nearly 40 square miles of western nevada county 
flames threatened the hightechnology grass valley group the 
countys largest employer with 1000 workers the fire reached 
three sides of the companys sprawling grounds and destroyed a 
storage shed the company produces video equipment used at 
television stations and makes specialeffects software for 
national television broadcasts 
the yuba county board of supervisors met late monday in 
emergency session to declare the zone a local disaster area and 
expressed concern that the fire may threaten beale air force base 
near marysville 20 miles to the west of the fire and the home base 
of the sr71 blackbird spy plane 
the blaze was fueled by droughtdry brush wood roofs and 
exploding propane tanks said state department of forestry 
spokesman charlie jakobs 
the greatest concentration of damage was around lake wildwood 
where at least 15 homes five boats and a dock were destroyed 
nineteen other structures outside of the lake wildwood area were 
destroyed including several residential trailers and agricultural 
buildings 
another fire about 80 miles west of lake wildwood in the coast 
range of sonoma county blackened more than 10 square miles 
destroyed several structures and temporarily threatened pacific gas 
amp electric cos geothermal plants 
altogether almost a dozen fires destroyed nearly 30000 acres 
of timber and brush in california monday about 5000 firefighters 
were on fire lines statewide

airlines already pinched by deregulatory competition and a 
pilot shortage may have trouble staffing their cockpits and paying 
additional salaries if researchers say pilots should fly reduced 
schedules 
faa scheduling regulations have changed little since the 1930s 
when lumbering prop planes rarely crossed more than one time zone a 
day among those who think they can be improved is john lauber a 
sleep researcher on the national transportation safety board 
an arbitrary restriction on flight and duty time and mandatory 
rest time that doesnt take into account circadian factors is 
simply not 20th century he said we know that an hour of sleep 
is not an hour of sleep depending on when you take it one of the 
biggest improvements we could make in our regulations would be to 
recognize those factors and adjust schedules appropriately 
the experts contend that schedules should consider the time of 
departure the number of time zones crossed and the direction of 
travel the body adjusts more quickly when traveling west to east 
than east to west 
another part of the problem is the plane itself the modern 
cockpit is a fine place for involuntary slumber the lights are 
dim the seats are comfortable the air rushes past with a soothing 
hum 
planes are so automated that they quite literally fly 
themselves except while landing and taking off there is often 
little for crew members to do the newest planes dont even require 
a flight engineer so standard crew size is being reduced from 
three members to two some pilots and sleep experts complain that 
this increases the odds the entire crew will doze off 
the fewer people in the cockpit the fewer safeguards you 
have said dr martin mooreede of harvard a sleep expert at 
harvard medical school its easier for two people to nod off 
than three 
but delmar fadden a boeing administrator asserts just the 
opposite is likely if there are only two in the cockpit both 
know that they cant rely on a third person so they are more 
attentive to the tasks they are doing and are much less likely to 
allow themselves to go to sleep 
fadden who establishes design requirements for the boeing 747 
and 767 said we cant do a lot about the fact that the crew 
might be fatigued what we try to do is make the airplane tolerant 
of the crews reaction 
this means designing planes to be safe even when flown by bored 
drowsy inattentive pilots if something goes wrong such as a 
generator failure the plane automatically compensates without 
waiting for the crew to act 
fadden said some planes being built will monitor their crews 
alarms will sound if pilots do nothing for 20 minutes such a lapse 
of activity could mean the pilots are daydreaming or worse 
another possible solution used by the british during the 
falkland islands crisis is a drug to help pilots sleep before 
night flights bill storm a psychologist at brooks air force base 
in san antonio texas said the us military is experimenting with 
the drug temazepam 
all of these suggested changes are intended to lessen the chance 
that cockpit fatigue will combine with bad weather equipment 
failure and other random hazards to trigger a disaster 
we run a very safe air transportation system said lauber 
but we are pushing people harder we know from anecdotal data 
that people are not as alert as they should be they are falling 
asleep in some circumstances i think its appropriate that we 
reexamine the way we approach these things

a sixth member of an ethnic coalition 
supporting republican george bushs presidential candidacy resigned 
today as president reagan declared that there isnt one iota of 
discrimination among the groups members 
bush campaign spokesman mark goodin said the resignation of radi 
slavoff as national cochairman of bulgarians for bush was accepted 
today 
slavoff quit the campaign after the philadelphia inquirer 
identified him over the weekend as former head of the bulgarian 
national front which the paper said was formed after world war ii 
by members of the nazialigned bulgarian legion 
reagan told reporters at the white house he believed five other 
ethnic advisers resigned monday because they didnt want to harm 
the campaign 
the president was not asked specifically about the resignation 
of frederic v malek a key bush operative and deputy chairman of 
the republican national committee who was named in a published 
report about possibly antisemitic activities during the nixon 
administration 
asked whether he thought the bush campaign suffered from an 
appearance of antisemitism among some of the vice presidents 
supporters reagan replied no 
asked to elaborate he said because i know him bush and i 
know the people involved and there isnt an iota of discrimination 
in any of them 
reagan commented after a rose garden ceremony where he signed 
fair housing legislation 
bush and the five former officials of the ethnic coalition said 
the controversy was politically motivated 
we are resigning today from the coalition of american 
nationalities and removing ourselves from the controversy because 
we have been attacked unfairly by george bushs political 
opponents the five said in a statement monday issued by bush 
spokesman mark goodin the statement did not name the opponents 
in announcing the resignations goodin said the bush campaign 
conducted a review of the allegations and found nothing to 
substantiate the reports 
the charges appear to be politically inspired by individuals 
who wish to divert public attention from the issues of the 
campaign goodin said nonetheless we believe these 
individuals have done the right thing by removing themselves from 
the controversy 
asked about the resignations during a campaign stop in illinois 
bush told reporters nobodys giving in these people left of 
their own volition were not accusing anybody of anything 
the vice president added were getting into a very peculiar 
deal where some people are accusing people i dont like it a bit 
the controversy arose after publication last week of an article 
in washington jewish week which said the bush campaign committee 
included florian galdau described as the new york chief of the 
iron guard romanias antisemitic pronazi movement and philip 
guarino a roman catholic priest listed as member of an illegal 
neofascist italian group 
galdau honorary chairman of the committee and guarino the 
coalitions vice chairman were among the five who resigned laszlo 
pasztor described in the article as a hungarianamerican who 
served in hungarys pronazi antisemitic arrowcross as a youth 
also resigned 
the other two committee members to step down were ignatius 
bilinsky and bohdan fedorak their alleged activities were not 
immediately known 
in the statement the former coalition members said these 
sassolike attacks are aimed at neutralizing the strong support 
which george bush has and will continue to have in the ethnic 
community 
john sasso a top aide to democratic nominee michael dukakis 
was forced to resign last year after he circulated the socalled 
attack video against former democratic candidate sen joe biden 
of delaware sasso rejoined the dukakis campaign during the labor 
day weekend 
on monday dukakis attacked bushs judgment after the additional 
resignations 
i think it raises continuing questions about mr bushs 
judgment dukakis said also raising as an issue bushs selection 
of indiana sen dan quayle as his running mate 
the resignations came one day after malek a bush appointee to 
the republican national committee stepped down after a published 
report said that while malek served in the nixon administration he 
compiled a list of jewish employees in top posts at the bureau of 
labor statistics 
john d ehrlichman a former white house aide to president 
nixon said maleks resignation was politically exactly the right 
thing to do but that malek was the victim of a bum rap 
because he was only following nixons orders 
ehrlichman interviewed on cbstvs this morning show said 
nixons order to determine whether a jewish cabal existed at 
the labor department agency was pure nixon venting spleen and 
rhetorical excess that his aides usually ignored 
he said malek was the farthest thing from a bigot of anybody i 
know 
the decision by the five committee members also comes less than 
a week after the coalitions cochairman jerome brentar was 
dismissed following the disclosure that he had defended john 
demjanjuk the onetime cleveland autoworker convicted in israel as 
a nazi war criminal he was also reported to be active in groups 
that questioned whether the holocaust had actually occurred 
no replacements for the five committee members have been named 
goodin said

patches of foulsmelling mud emerged 
tuesday as flood waters filled with sewage and rotting garbage 
continued to recede and the government fought a losing battle 
against a diarrhea epidemic 
although vast sections of the nation remained under several feet 
of water land emerged in dhaka and other areas where millions of 
people were living in waterlogged homes and makeshift shelters 
because their houses were flooded 
the number of officially reported diarrhea cases rose sharply 
and a senior health ministry official warned of major health 
hazards 
the filth caused by flooding and the millions of gallons of 
sewage and tons of rotting garbage are posing a serious threat to 
the health of 6 million people in dhaka the official said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the governments press information department said 33054 new 
cases of diarrhea were reported across the country in the past 24 
hours thats more than triple the number of cases reported on a 
daily basis a week ago 
tuesdays report brought to 283703 the number of officially 
recorded diarrhea cases since aug 27 when the last round of 
flooding began the information department said the number of 
diarrhea deaths since then was 150 
the total number of flood deaths since june 13 when the summer 
floods started then receded before rising to new heights in late 
august was 893 according to a government reports but daily 
reports in dhaka newspapers said 1723 people died from drowning 
snake bites house collapsing and diseases 
the real number is impossible to ascertain given bangladeshs 
unwieldy bureaucracy and communications that were poor even before 
floods that covered threequarters of the nation 
the flood control center said all major rivers including the 
ganges brahmaputra and meghna continued to fall by 1 to 2 inches 
a day in most places this meant the rivers were still 16 to 27 
inches above flood level 
jay f morris deputy director of the us agency for 
international development toured floded areas tuesday and told 
reporters he knew the water was receding but its worse than i 
expected at this stage its one of the worst things ive ever 
seen in my life 
morris arrived in dhaka on monday aboard a transport plane 
bearing part of the united statess promised 150 million in relief 
materials 
morriss tour included the village of maosaid 15 miles northeast 
of dhaka where he distribuited about 350 food packets that were 
prepared by the care relief organization with funds from us aid 
families designated by care field workers received the packages 
after waiting five hours for morris arrival at a roman catholic 
church where flood waters lapped at the steps 
behind the church is a home for retarded girls operated by the 
sisters of charity the order headed by mother teresa of calcutta 
india winner of the 1979 nobel peace prize 
sister blaise a native of ranchi india said she and the six 
other indian and bangladeshi nuns had to tie the girls to keep them 
from falling into three feet of water that flooded their dormitory 
two weeks ago 
the dormitory is now above water but most of the village is a 
sea of ankledeep mud with pools of stagnated water 
sister marienoel said most people in the village were eating 
one meal a day because food stores were low and the nuns were 
taking rice and lentils from their dwindling stock to nearby areas 
where people had lost their homes

firefighters took 
advantage of a cold spell to make some headway against blazes that 
have devastated much of this famed park before hotter drier 
weather returns 
the fire people realize that things could heat up again this 
week said fire information officer sonya capek the fires are 
still a threat we are not out of it yet we know there is some 
more fire time left in the season but hopefully it wont be as 
intense 
temperatures were only in the 40s this morning while the force 
of some 8000 firefighters worked to strengthen existing firebreaks 
and prepare to protect the areas of mammoth hot springs and 
gardiner and jardine mont if necessary jardine and park 
headquarters at mammoth were evacuated before rain and snow fell 
over the weekend 
president reagan said today that the interior department policy 
of letting naturally caused fires burn in national forests had been 
scrapped in the wake of the yellowstone fires 
asked what he thought of the policy reagan told reporters i 
have questioned it i did not even know it existed frankly he 
said that interior secretary donald hodel has made it plain that 
we were withdrawing from this policy 
updated forecasts for the area said the sky would be cloudy 
through wednesday with highs rising to around 60 degrees and 
isolated showers expected late today 
in california a fastmoving fire continued to burn out of 
control today in the gold rush country of the sierra nevada 
foothills but firefighters said it was 30 percent contained 
that blaze which covered 40 square miles early today has 
consumed about 150 buildings including more than 90 homes and 
forced the evacuation of more than 8000 people 
the fire was spreading into an area east of beale air force 
base a less populated area and a forestry spokesman said 
firefighters may be able to spend less time protecting structures 
and devote more energy on containing the blaze 
but fire officials stressed that many houses were still in 
extreme danger especially in rough and ready a community of about 
500 residents in the heavily wooded bottom of a steep canyon on the 
edge of the fire 
elsewhere in california fires burned in a remote section of 
sonoma county north of san francisco and in del norte county near 
the oregon border 
fires also burned monday in montana colorado idaho utah 
oregon and washington state the interagency fire center in boise 
idaho which coordinates firefighting efforts in the west calls 
this the worst forest fire season in 30 years 
temperatures at yellowstone remained in the 40s monday keeping 
humidity at up to 50 percent 
but the weather was expected to begin clearing today and the 
mercury was expected to climb to 70 degrees by wednesday 
its a sleeping giant now said incident commander denny 
bungarz during a briefing we want to tie it down so when it 
wakes up it cant run on us 
the historic fires have charred 939270 acres of the 22 
millionacre park since june 
about 1000 marines from camp pendleton calif were to reach 
yellowstone today to bolster firefighters some of the first 
soldiers sent to yellowstone army troops from fort lewis wash 
were not to be released until at least saturday 
well have lots of people here so maybe we can nail this 
thing bungarz said 
firefighters worked monday to strengthen fire lines and attack 
hot spots as officials worked to establish a fire camp at mammoth 
hot springs 
the favorable weather allowed park officials to open all roads 
through the park except the northeast entrance leading to cooke 
city mont where workers were repairing roads 
despite the return of warmer weather the arrival of fall with 
lower temperatures and shorter days had officials optimistic the 
fires would make no more major advances 
we still expect fire activity but it wont be as intense or 
as much or as fast as it has been in the past said fire 
information officer sonya capek the days are getting shorter so 
the burning period is getting shorter 
officials were also hopeful that a heavy snow will throw a wet 
white blanket on the fires soon light snow fell on yellowstone 
sunday 
we can generally expect some pretty good snowfalls in 
september and early october said the parks chief researcher 
john varley we usually have a pretty good snowstorm around the 
equinox sept 21 and i think weve all got our fingers crossed 
that that will indeed come and put a further damper on the fires 
elsewhere in the yellowstone area firefighters in the 
bridgerteton national forest hoped to control a 38000acre fire 
by tonight 
in northwestern montana crews made progress in their battle 
against a 31500acre fire burning in and near glacier national 
park gov ted schwinden lifted a sweeping ban on all outdoor 
recreational activities that was imposed because of fire danger 
in colorado crews were pulled from fire lines monday when 
drizzle rain and snow fell on the last of the forest fires that 
have scorched more than 13000 acres

was reunited with his wife marlene today after she flew from bonn 
with senior government officials to take him home cordes said he 
felt born again

security officers to the foreign ministry in damascus at 5 pm and 
turned over to west german government envoys by foreign minister 
farouk alsharaa 
im rejoicing for being a free man again i feel im born 
again cordes said it is as if i have been granted a new life 
i am feeling perfect and im in a very good shape 
earlier cordes and his wife had an emotional reunion at the 
government guest house where he spent the night after his release 
she fell into his arms and they kissed each other for a long 
time an official who witnessed the reunion told the associated 
press 
he said mrs cordes turned to syrian army officers who escorted 
her from the airport to the guest house and said thank you

cordes 55 was released late monday in beirut by proiranian 
shiite moslem extremists who kidnapped him in january 1987 he was 
driven to damascus by brig ali hammoud syrias military 
intelligence chief in beirut 
cordes was the last west german hostage in lebanon where 17 
other foreigners are held captive asked today if he had seen any 
of the other hostages he said i havent seen any hostages i 
was alone 
cordes captors said his release was linked to a lebanese shiite 
on trial in west germany for the 1985 hijacking of the twa jet and 
the shooting death of us navy diver robert stethem 
in a note issued in beirut they said if mohammed ali hamadis 
release cannot be gained legally then we shall be obliged to 
again resort to violence 
cordes and his wife were expected to drive from the foreign 
ministry to the airport to take off in the canadianbuilt 
twinengined jet for the fivehour flight to a military airbase 
near bonn 
seventeen foreigners including nine americans are still 
missing in lebanon and it is believed most are held by proiranian 
shiite kidnappers longest held is terry anderson chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press anderson 40 was 
kidnapped in beirut on march 16 1985 
in bonn a west german government spokesman who asked not to be 
further identified said he knew of no deal with iran or with the 
kidnappers for cordes freedom 
the government has repeatedly denied that it paid a ransom for 
the release last september for alfred schmidt another west german 
who had been held captive in beirut 
chancellor helmut kohl said his government will use the 
countrys ties with iran and syria to try gain freedom for other 
hostages in lebanon and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher 
credited west germanys continuing ties with iran for helping to 
bring about cordes release 
cordes and schmidt were kidnapped in beirut in january 1987 in 
the week after hamadis arrest in frankfurt 
schmidt an engineer was freed sept 7 1987 
hamadi 24 has acknowledged in a frankfurt court to hijacking 
the plane but denies killing stethem in the murder and air piracy 
trial monday the captain of the hijacked jetliner john testrake 
testified that he believed hamadi fired the shot that killed 
stethem aboard the aircraft 
the kidnappers note one of three issued monday in beirut said 
the decision to release cordes does not mean in any way the 
abandonment of holy warrior mohammed hamadi 
his brother abbas hamadi 29 is serving a 13year prison 
sentence in frankfurt he was convicted in april of complicity in 
kidnapping cordes and schmidt in an effort to force west germany to 
free mohammed hamadi 
in another development lebanon radio and us officials said an 
american engineer who was kidnapped in lebanon on sunday 
overpowered his captors and escaped to damascus on monday with the 
help of syrian troops 
another version said syrian troops in lebanon rescued the 
engineer identified in washington as kenneth wells after 
overpowering the kidnappers 
the discrepancies could not immediately be reconciled 
gunmen abducted wells 25 who reportedly works in saudi arabia 
for litton industries and holds a black belt in karate

a handicapped woman who persisted with 
efforts to help the needy even while she was homeless has been 
honored by the same federal agency that had her evicted last year 
the department of housing and urban development honored dorothea 
bradley at a luncheon monday with a presidential recognition award 
for her community service 
the award covers 1987 the year she was locked out of her house 
where she used to distribute groceries to fellow handicapped 
residents 
ms bradley had lived rentfree in the pasadena home for five 
years but the owners defaulted on their lowinterest federal 
housing administration loan and a us marshal padlocked the door 
last november 
that left her a bit skeptical about hud 
when hud called to tell me i had won an award i said sure 
then i began to get letters telling me about it she said 
in july hud sent correspondence that offered congratulations 
from president reagan for her successful efforts to improve the 
nutritional wellbeing of lowincome handicapped persons 
after she was evicted ms bradley continued to help the needy 
distributing food from a room at the american friends committee in 
pasadena under a food giveaway program subsidized by hud 
ms bradley said she lived in her van for two months until a man 
who heard about her plight rented her a small house 
i never stopped helping the handicapped said ms bradley 
who suffers from an arthritic spine and lives on a monthly social 
security check 
despite the eviction ms bradley apparently harbors no 
bitterness the commendation letter from hud has an honored place 
in her home 
everyday when i sit down for dinner i look at it smile and 
know that they do care about me ms bradley said i didnt 
think anybody paid any attention to me or even cared

the california supreme court has refused to 
hear the appeal of a gay bathhouse that was shut down by a court 
order under a new los angeles county enforcement policy aimed at 
combatting the spread of aids 
the courts action monday left intact the first such order under 
the countys policy which requires any bathhouse in which anal or 
oral sex takes place to be closed as a public nuisance a previous 
policy prohibited anal sex without condoms in bathhouses but did 
not seek to close the establishments 
we were attempting to work with bathhouses have them serve as 
education centers said deputy county counsel steven carnevale 
we thought they would go away by themselves because they were 
losing business it turned out that they were much larger than 
anybody expected 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is spread largely through 
sexual contact and sharing of infected needles by drug abusers 
in may los angeles county officials sought to close macs 
bathhouse after an undercover investigation found numerous 
violations an injunction was issued aug 30 
after a state appeals court refused to intervene lawyers for 
macs appealed last week to the state supreme court 
attorney barrett litt argued that the order closing macs was 
excessive because an order forbidding specific sexual practices 
would accomplish the same goal while protecting the privacy rights 
of the bathhouses customers 
quoting a number of health experts litt said closing gay 
bathhouses would not reduce the risk of aids and would likely 
increase it sexual activities at bathhouses were safer than in 
the general population he said 
after the violations were found macs required every patron to 
sign a copy of the rules distributed cards stating the risk of 
specific types of sexual activities and started showing safe 
sex videos litt said 
the county still has about 10 bathhouses which are generally 
making goodfaith efforts to follow the rules prohibiting sexual 
intercourse carnevale said san francisco closed down its gay 
bathhouses

heavy combat in northern rebel 
strongholds killed or wounded more than 80 leftists guerrillas and 
government troops a military spokesman said today 
col galileo torres said guerrillas attacked the el paraiso 
garrison headquarters of the 4th army brigade in chalatenango 
province at 105 am with mortar fire 
nine soldiers and five guerrillas died in the attack 37 miles 
north of the capital of san salvador and 12 government troops were 
wounded he said 
torres head of the armed forces press office also said there 
were a series of clashes in northern morazan province between 
government units and guerrillas 
the rebels suffered 50 casualties in morazan and five soldiers 
were wounded he said in a telephone interview 
both provinces are strongholds of the rebel faribuno marti 
national liberation front where guerrillas move freely and even 
exercise some administration of towns and villages 
he said the fighting at el paraiso lasted two hours and officers 
on the scene believed quite a few rebels were wounded the 
bodies of five rebels and six m16 assault rifles were recovered 
torres said 
it was the first guerrilla attack on a brigade headquarters 
since a february assault on the 3rd brigade in eastern usulutan 
province 
a us military adviser the first to die in combat was killed 
at el paraiso in march 1987 when rebels penetrated the base 
killing 70 government soldiers there are several dozen us 
military advisers at bases in chalatenango 
torres said the fighting in morazan began at 4 pm monday and 
lasted until 3 am tuesday he called it a series of encounters 
between three government commando units of about 15 men each and a 
significant guerrilla column 
helicopters ferrying wounded soldiers and supplies were still 
coming under fire several hours after the main clashes ended he 
said and troops were still mopping up around gigante hill outside 
perquin 125 miles northeast of san salvador 
he said col emilio ponce commander of the eastern military 
zone told him at midmorning there was still no breakdown between 
dead and wounded in the 50 guerrilla casualities he said he did 
not know how many bodies had been recovered 
there was no way to immediately confirm the official casualty 
figures 
earlier this month the military claimed 25 rebels dead near 
tejutepeque in central el salvador but reporters at the scene 
confirmed only four dead precise casualties are also hard to pin 
down because the rebels try to remove their dead from the 
battlefield

the president of first nationwide bank 
complained to a congressional panel tuesday that his institution 
should not have been frozen out of negotiations in the largestever 
government rescue of a savings association 
robert e lackovic president of the san franciscobased first 
nationwide told the house energy and commerce oversight 
subcommittee that federal regulators cannot be sure they got the 
best deal in the rescue of american savings and loan association of 
stockton calif because regulators had negotiated exclusively 
since april with the investors who were eventually chosen to take 
over american 
the federal home loan bank board announced sept 5 that they 
were providing 2 billion in government assistance to the robert m 
bass group of fort worth texas to acquire american the largest 
insolvent sampl in the nation bass in its first venture into the 
savings industry is putting up 550 million 
first nationwide a subsidiary of ford motor co had 
unsuccessfully tried through most of 1987 and early this year to 
close a deal with the bank board as the governments negotiations 
with bass continued first nationwide failed in attempts to get 
back in the running 
first nationwide cannot help but be disappointed in the 
outcome of negotiations had we been given the opportunity to 
remain in the bidding the outcome may have been the same but the 
uncertainty as to whether the government indeed had accepted the 
best bid would have been eliminated lackovic told the 
subcommittee chaired by rep john d dingell dmich 
lackovic also criticized a provision of the bass deal which 
permits the investment group to use 15 billion of americans 
resources for a merchant bank to invest in corporate takeovers and 
other ventures not traditional for savings institutions 
we do not believe that congress intent was to permit a 
merchant bank to use lowcost funds from savings and loan 
institutions he said in many instances the troubled 
thrifts are the ones that deviated widely from their traditional 
role and have engaged in highly risky investments 
lackovic questioned the wisdom of the government in retaining 
about a 30 percent ownership interest in the new american 
can the board apply the same standards to thrifts in which it 
owns a significant share versus a competitor it regulates that is 
owned by private sector shareholders he asked 
also alluding to bass lack of experience in the savings field 
lackovic said it is vital that the bank board work with 
companies that have demonstrated longterm commitments to the 
savings and loan industry 
m danny wall chairman of the bank board has defended the bass 
deal arguing that the 15 billion is a relatively small piece of 
american and that a merchant bank was worth trying 
he also has said that maintaining and ownership interest in a 
rescued institution gives the government a chance to recoup some of 
its investments and he has said it is important to bring outside 
capital into the savings industry

thousands of documents relating to the slayings 
of 29 black children in atlanta must be returned to the fbi a 
judge has ruled 
us district judge richard c freeman instructed city officials 
to return files containing 2300 documents related to the 
investigation of the killings in 197981 
the files were released to the public in 1987 along with atlanta 
police files on the case the federal government then sued atlanta 
public safety commissioner george napper charging that he violated 
federal law when he released fbi documents along with the police 
files 
freemans order filed aug 31 said the issue was whether the 
city had acted properly in releasing information the fbi had shared 
only on the condition it remain confidential 
the court here is not concerned with whether the investigatory 
documents should be released to the public freemans order said 
the question before the court is who owns and is entitled to 
possession of the documents 
napper had released the police files in response to an order by 
fulton county superior court judge luther alverson who ruled in a 
lawsuit filed by several news media organizations 
wayne williams an atlanta freelance photographer was

the richest treasury of archeological 
artifacts ever found in the americas has been discovered in the 
1500yearold tomb of a warriorleader of a civilization that once 
dominated peru the national geographic society announced tuesday 
the tomb containing the remains of a man who apparently was a 
major chief of the moche people was excavated by peruvian 
archeologists who were tipped to the site by grave robbers 
it is truly the richestever find archeologically in the 
americas said christopher b donnan a ucla professor who has 
spent his career studying the moche people this should greatly 
accelerate the reconstruction of one of the greatest of the 
american civilizations 
the yearlong excavation of the tomb was conducted by a team of 
peruvian archeologists led by walter alva director of the bruning 
museum of lambayeque peru the work was funded by the national 
geographic society 
at a news conference tuesday alva said through a translator 
that the tomb was discovered after gold and silver artifacts began 
turning up on the black market in january 1987 some of the 
artifacts were confiscated by the customs office in los angeles he 
said 
police in peru raided the home of a suspected grave robber 
resulting in a shootout that killed one said alva artifacts 
recovered from the home were traced to a site near the village of 
sipan 
alva said the area adjacent to two eroding adobe pyramids 
appears to contain up to 10 tombs of moche leaders he said there 
are plans to excavate them all 
the moche people said alva created a civilization skilled in 
metal work and agriculture he said they built a complex irrigation 
system that enabled them to establish an advanced society on the 
dry coastal plains of peru starting in about 100 ad the 
civilization lasted about 1000 years he said and eventually was 
supplanted by the incas the incas in turn were conquered by the 
spanish in the 1530s 
alva said the tomb that has been excavated contains the remains 
of a warriorpriest encased in a wooden coffin and surrounded 
by thousands of articles made of gold silver precious stone and 
ceramic he said the man was about 40 and was at or near the 
pinnacle of power in the moche civilization during his lifetime 
decay of the bones made it impossible to determine the cause of 
death he said but there was no evidence of violence 
also in the tomb said alva are up to eight other human 
remains plus those of a dog and two llamas 
it appears he said that the servants and wives of the moche 
leaders were sacrificed and buried with them 
one of the skeletons was found above the others apparently 
placed there alva said as a guardian the skeleton is that of 
a young warrior alva said both feet of the guardian had been 
amputated apparently in the belief that it would keep the young 
warrior from fleeing his assignment to guard his leader in death

the defense department has ordered a cut in 
the required tour length for all military personnel stationed in 
panama as part of an effort to reduce the number of dependents in 
the troubled central american nation the pentagon said tuesday 
dan howard the departments chief spokesman said the policy 
change would reduce from 36 months to 30 months the required tour 
for servicemen accompanied by their families and drop from 24 
months to 15 months the tour for those deploying alone 
the latter reduction is considered the most important howard 
explained the department also is enforcing a change to its 
concurrent travel policy under which servicemen cannot bring 
their families to panama unless they have already secured housing 
on a military reservation 
since there is currently a waiting period of up to nine months 
for such housing the new tour length should encourage more 
soldiers just to go unaccompanied added maj kathy wood a 
pentagon spokeswoman 
panama is the home of the us southern command the 
organization responsible for all us military forces in central 
and south america about 10000 american servicemen are stationed 
permanently in panama and about 2200 others have been assigned 
there on a temporary basis since the spring to upgrade security at 
us bases 
according to wood the decision to reduce the tour lengths was 
made initially last week by the army gaining the approval of gen 
carl e vuono the chief of staff and army secretary john o 
marsh the defense department then reviewed the matter and ordered 
similar changes for the air force and navy which have much smaller 
contingents in panama 
over the past six months the pentagon has succeeded in reducing 
by 50 percent the number of military families living outside us 
bases in panama dropping the total still off base to about 1100 
the effort has taken on more momentum this summer because of what 
the united states describes as a deliberate campaign of harassing 
americans assigned to panama 
us officials in panama city said on aug 21 that american 
personnel had reported at least 240 incidents of harassment by 
panamanian authorities this year including attempts to extort 
bribes for traffic violations and the stoppage of mail 
the harassment comes at a time when the united states is 
continuing to press economic sanctions against panama in a bid to 
oust the countrys military leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
who has been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida on 
drugtrafficking charges

republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle 
ridiculed michael dukakis national security credentials today and 
joked that the democratic nominee lost his top naval adviser last 
week his rubber duck drowned in his bathtub 
quayle accused dukakis of lacking knowledge of defense and 
foreign policy matters even as the democratic candidate delivered a 
major policy speech in chicago on sovietamerican relations 
its sad for america to have somebody that doesnt have the 
understanding or qualifications in national security to be the 
democratic nominee for president quayle told an audience at 
bushquayle campaign headquarters for wisconsin 
he said he had a sad story to tell about the dukakis 
campaign 
the governor of massachusetts he lost his top naval adviser 
last week quayle said his rubber duck drowned in his 
bathtub 
dukakis press secretary dayton duncan responded quayles 
trying to call attention to his age quayle is 41 
on monday quayle blasted dukakis economic program telling a 
michigan audience that the democratic candidates heart may be in 
the right place but his handll be back in your pocket with 
higher taxes and government spending if he is elected in november 
dukakis would end the economic expansion of the reagan years and 
return us once again to those chilling days of nogrowth under 
jimmy carter quayle asserted at a speech in kalamazoo mich and 
in campaign stops aimed at bluecollar workers and their employers 
the republican vice presidential candidate travels to bismarck 
nd today and colorado as he continues this weeks swing through 
the midwest and west 
the trip began with a tour of an american instruments 
corporation plant in kalamazoo a city of about 100000 that has 
weathered tough economic times during the decade 
about half of american instruments 75 workers have participated 
in training programs through the job training partnership act 
which quayle helped write the 1982 federal law encourages 
businesses to train disadvantaged or dislocated workers and place 
them in local jobs 
in remarks to business leaders at the rotary club quayle 
sounded the good jobs good wages theme that has become a 
standard part of dukakis speeches 
he said stagnation and unguided economic policies had been 
the result of the last liberal state governor we plucked from 
relative obscurity and put in the white house a reference to 
carter 
but during the republican administration 17 million new jobs 
were created 12 million of them in occupations with wages 
averaging more than 20000 a year including 55 million with 
wages averaging closer to 30000 quayle said 
theyre good jobs at good wages and thats a record to be 
proud of quayle said 
the message for those who have not yet made it because of 
past disadvantage or discrimination quayle said is that america 
still can be the land of opportunity in which free men and women 
can prosper through their own efforts and their own hard work 
quayle also toured a milwaukee plant which makes heavy equipment 
for us weapons systems he drew cheers from the workers when he 
got behind the controls of a giant forklift and told the crowd i 
want my union card 
when someone shouted that he would have to pay his dues quayle 
whose campaign has been beset by a series of highly publicized 
controversies over his military service and academic record shot 
back ive paid some dues over these last few weeks 
quayle also responded later to comments by dukakis who said 
monday that george bushs answer to drug kingpins like panama 
leader manuel noriega is j danforth quayle 
the governor obviously doesnt know what hes talking about 
quayle told reporters weve conducted a very vigorous war on 
drugs quite frankly contrary to the governor of massachusetts 
who obviously doesnt believe that tough law enforcement provides a 
deterrence we do

three of the most prominent 
antiapartheid activists detained under stateofemergency 
regulations escaped from a hospital today and took refuge in the 
us consulate 
the three men have requested a meeting with us ambassador 
edward perkins 
two of the men are senior officials of the banned united 
democratic front publicity secretary murphy morobe a black and 
acting general secretary mohammed valli moosa an indian the other 
is vusi khanyile a black who was chairman of the banned national 
education crisis committee 
the us embassy in pretoria issued a statement confirming that 
the three had taken refuge at the consulate on the 11th floor of 
an office building in downtown johannesburg 
we were in frequent contact with these three men prior to 
their detention without charge and hold them in high regard the 
statement said we will not press them to leave against their 
will 
the statement said the united states does not offer asylum at 
its diplomatic offices but it said these premises are inviolable 
under international law and may not be entered by the host 
government without consent 
the embassy said it was discussing the situation with the 
activists and the south african government 
brig leon mellet a spokesman for the law and order ministry 
confirmed the incident and said the men escaped from johannesburg 
general hospital where they had been receiving physiotherapy no 
details of the escape were disclosed 
previously the three had been at johannesburgs diepkloof 
prison 
at the consulate there was no visible sign of security force 
deployments a private guard stood at the entrance while about two 
dozen journalists waited in the hall 
morobe 32 and valli moosa 34 were detained in july 1987 
after working clandestinely for the front since a state of 
emergency was declared june 12 1986 khanyile 37 was detained in 
december 1986 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge for 
varying periods during the state of emergency the government has 
not released comprehensive statistics but it said recently that 
802 people who had been held at least 30 days were still in custody 
many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated 
to the united democratic front a nationwide coalition of more than 
600 antiapartheid groups 
also detained were virtually all top leaders of the national 
education crisis committee a coalition of parent teacher and 
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum 
and policies in their schools 
the committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts 
that spread nationwide in 198586 but the government outlawed its 
subsequent campaign for peoples education 
the united democratic front and the crisis committee were among 
17 antiapartheid organizations banned in february from conducting 
any activities 
twice in recent years activists have taken refuge at diplomatic 
missions in south africa six front leaders stayed at the british 
consulate in durban for several weeks in late 1984 before emerging 
to face arrest for high treason the charges later were withdrawn 
in september 1987 south africa agreed to let a dutchman klaus 
de jonge return to the netherlands after being holed up at a dutch 
embassy office in pretoria for two years de jonge escaped into the 
office from police custody after being arrested for aiding the 
outlawed african national congress guerrilla movement

tumbled into the rio grande there wouldnt have been anything 
left of this bus he said 
the area had been hit by a powerful thunderstorm just a few 
hours before the accident and state police officer tr rodella

for

children were crying people were crying people were lying 
down sanchez said 
he said he and another man freed the infant and then began 
helping other passengers from the bus because they feared an 
explosion 
i feel fortunate he said i didnt even feel the pain 
until afterwards i was just concerned for that woman and her 
baby

55 mph when the crash occurred

israeli peace crusader abie nathan could be 
criminally prosecuted for holding talks with plo chief yasser 
arafat and offering a peace plan that calls for mutual recognition 
israel radio reported today 
the meeting prompted a political storm in israel 
rightwing legislators said nathan should to be tried for 
treason but leftwing politicians praised the meeting as an 
important step toward ending the 9monthold palestinian uprising 
in the occupied lands 
israel radio said nathan recently met with arafat in tunis and 
presented the plo leader with a peace plan that includes mutual 
recognition between israel and the plo a plo agreement to a 
100day moratorium on violence and an end to the palestinian 
uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
nathans plan also calls for the release of israeli soldiers 
missing or captured in lebanon in exchange for the israeli release 
of thousands of palestinians detained since the uprising began dec 
8 israel radio said 
according to the united nations more than 260 palestinians have 
been killed in the uprising and five israelis also have died 
nathan said arafat promised to consider the peace proposals 
after he meets tuesday with socialist members of the european 
parliament in strasbourg france according to israel radio 
nathan who founded the voice of peace radio station in 1973 
could face prosecution and a prison sentence of up to three years 
for his visit with the palestine liberation organization leader 
the meeting violates a 1986 israeli law barring unauthorized 
contacts with members of terrorist groups israel views the plo as 
a terrorist group 
four israeli leftists are serving sixmonth prison terms for 
meeting with plo members in romania in 1986 
nathan hopes to brief prime minister yitzhak shamir and foreign 
minister shimon peres on his encounter with the plo chief when he 
returns to israel israel radio said 
both peres who favors an international middle east peace 
conference and shamir who opposes such a forum have staunchly 
refused to include the plo in peace negotiations 
rightwing legislator yuval nehman of the tehiya party demanded 
that nathan be arrested on his return to israel for illegally 
meeting with an enemy the radio said but two israeli leftwing 
parties mapam and the progressive list for peace praised nathan 
for making an important step toward peace 
leftwing legislator yair zaban of mapam said nathan was an 
israeli patriot and urged the plo to recognize israel israel 
radio said 
nathans radio station beams mostly rock music programs from a 
ship anchored outside tel aviv in the mediterranean sea 
in its heyday a decade ago the socalled peace ship dodged 
bullets to broadcast peace messages from beirut during the 1973 
arabisraeli war 
two years later the vessel delivered 100000 flowers to the 
people of egypt as a gesture of peace

president reagan signed legislation tuesday 
putting new enforcement teeth in the openhousing law congress 
passed in the wake of martin luther king jrs 1968 assassination 
standing with members of congress in the white house rose 
garden reagan hailed the newly enacted bill as the most 
important civil rights legislation in 20 years 
singling out rep john lewis dga who had accompanied king to 
washington for the civil rights leaders i have a dream speech 
in 1963 the president said the legislation has brought us one 
step closer to realizing martin luther kings dream 
the measure which was passed overwhelmingly by the house and 
senate extends antidiscrimination protections to the handicapped 
and to families with children it also empowers the federal 
government for the first time to seek fines of up to 100000 
against individuals or organizations found to have engaged in a 
pattern of housing discrimination 
under the openhousing provision of the civil rights act of 
1968 the government was given only a mediating role in housing 
discrimination disputes 
discrimination is particularly tragic when it means a family 
is refused housing near good schools a good job or simply in a 
better neighborhood to raise children reagan said this bill 
is the product of years of bipartisan work and repairs a 
significant defect in civil rights law 
he said that while the 1968 law was wellintentioned it 
lacked teeth its concilation provisions were ineffective when 
used 
reagan said that he and housing secretary samuel pierce had 
devoted eight years to seeking improvements in the 1968 law 
to redress the absence of penalties and the inability of the 
government to initiate actions except when a pattern of 
dsicrimination could be proven 
under the bill he signed tuesday the department of housing and 
urban development will have authority to initiate enforcement 
actions and to seek penalties against individuals businesses or 
organizations that discriminate on the basis of race color sex or 
national origin in the sale rental or financing of housing 
it authorizes civil penalties which could be recommended 
following an agency administrative enforcement process of up to 
10000 or a first offense 25000 for a second and up to 50000 
for a third 
in instances where a pattern of discrimination has been alleged 
the government could seek up to 50000 for a first offense and as 
much as 100000 for subsequent offenses 
besides strengthening existing provisions in law dealing with 
racial discrimination the measure protects the handicapped against 
housing bias for instance a landlord could be considered to be in 
violation if he refused to make reasonable modifications in 
premises to accommodate the handicapped 
under the section protecting families with children from 
discrimination in the sale rental or financing of housing 
buildings that are now adult only could exclude children only 
if the managers or owners of these structures adopted a policy to 
rent or sell to the elderly only 
sen paul simon dill who took part in the ceremony said 
that today there is wide agreement after nearly two decades of 
experience that the fair housing act has not been invested with 
adequate enforcement remedies today we give the law the tools 
needed to make its promise a reality for all of our families 
reagan used the occasion to throw a bouquet in the direction of 
vice president george bush who was out on the campaign trail as 
the republican presidential nominee 
the civil rights act of 1968 included for the first time in 
our history a fair housing provision that was a major achievement 
one that many members of congress including a young congressman 
named george bush had to show enormous courage to vote for the

secretary of state george shultz said tuesday 
the united states has compelling evidence that iraq has used 
chemical weapons against its kurdish citizens 
but he said the united nations should conduct its own probe 
before being asked to condemn iraq for alleged genocide 
several members of the senate judiciary committee said however 
that an immediate security council session is imperative to make 
the case against iraq 
shultz contended that it is important that the world body 
investigate the facts independently 
not everybody agrees with what we say the facts are shultz 
told the committee he added that the government of turkey has said 
it can find no evidence among the kurdish refugees fleeing from 
iraq that chemical weapons were used against them 
what you want is for the united nations to form a team and go 
an see what the facts are shultz said 
shultz commented as senator after senator said the evidence the 
united states possesses appears to be solid and should be presented 
to the security council now to bring into focus the question of 
whether iraq is subjecting its kurdish minority to a deliberate 
campaign of genocide 
shultz said the united states reached the conclusion iraq is 
using chemical weapons against the kurds based on its own 
examination of kurdish refugees inside turkey and on other 
evidence which to me seems to be compelling 
i feel our evidence is quite convincing he said but 
were not in a position to make that public 
shultz noted that the un conducted an earlier investigation 
into accusations that iraq had used chemical weapons in its war 
with iran and concluded such weapons were in fact used

confessed twa hijacker mohammed 
ali hamadi proudly pointed out the blood of a slain us hostage 
and indicated he was happy the navy diver was dead an american 
witness testified tuesday 
flight engineer benjamin zimmermann described how he and hamadi 
walked around the front of the twa aircraft in algeria in june 
1985 and hamadi showed him the blood left by the shooting death of 
us navy diver robert stethem 
mr hamadi joyfully pointed to the blood running down the 
door and with the pistol he pointed he indicated he was very 
proud of this gun and of him having caused this zimmermann told 
the court 
stethem of waldorf md was shot to death during the june 1985 
hijacking of twa flight 847 his body was thrown onto the runway in 
beirut before the plane went to algiers in previous testimony 
flight 847 pilot john testrake identified hamadi as stethems 
killer 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem is on trial on air piracy and 
murder charges he has admitted to the court that he was one of the 
two hijackers but he denied killing stethem 
zimmermann of cascade idaho was the only witness tuesday he 
was the flight engineer aboard the athenstorome flight when it 
was hijacked to beirut on june 14 1985 he said he was kicked and 
pistolwhipped during the ordeal 
the arab hijackers held 39 americans hostage for 17 days during 
the hijacking the jet flew to beirut then to algeria then back 
to beirut 
as tuesdays court session began chief judge hainer 
mueckenberger welcomed the release of west german hostage rudolf 
cordes in beirut cordes was freed monday after 20 months of 
captivity 
cordes and another west german alfred schmidt were kidnapped 
in beirut in january 1987 soon hamadi was arrested at frankfurt 
airport with explosives in his luggage hamadis older brother 
abbas was convicted by a duesseldorf court of helping kidnap 
schmidt and cordes in a bid to free his brother 
schmidt was released sept 7 1987 in what his kidnappers said 
was a good will gesture cordes captors referred to the hamadi 
trial when they freed cordes on monday in a note issued in beirut 
the kidnappers said if hamadis freedom cant be gained legally 
they will again resort to violence 
this happy news means an end to endless speculation about what 
influence cordes captivity might have had on these proceedings 
judge mueckenberger said tuesday adding that outside elements 
had never influenced the court 
zimmermann said he was stunned by hamadis behavior in pointing 
out the blood i wondered how he expected me to respond to him 
it was as if he wanted congratulations it seemed to be a great 
moment to him what that blood represented to him zimmermann 
said 
when asked by the judge if he wished to comment on the 
testimony hamadi said there is a lot of conflicting testimony 
but i have nothing to say 
zimmerman said the hijackers beat him and other passengers 
during the ordeal i would be hit on the side of the head with 
the gun butt when i would bend forward the blows would go down my 
back he told the court 
zimmermann described the events that led up to stethems death 
he said that when negotiations for fuel with the tower in beirut 
went too slowly hamadi shouted get up get up to stethem by 
that time according to other testimony stethem had been severely 
beaten by the two hijackers 
zimmermann said the hijackers then left the cockpit 
i heard a pop i heard someone exhale very loudly i heard it 
above the engine noises the shock of that noise was added to by 
the copilot on the radio stating that we needed fuel because they 
were killing passengers zimmermann told the court he added in 
later testimony that he did not know which of the hijackers had the 
pistol just before the sailor was shot 
they exchanged the pistol frequently so it was hard to 
determine who had it when zimmermann said 
zimmermann echoing earlier testimony from the planes captain 
said the hijackers seemed welltrained and familiar with the 
aircraft 
someone had taught them about the airplane they knew where 
the crash axe should have been stored said zimmermann who added 
that he hid the ax after realizing that the plane was being 
commandeered 
testrake testified monday that he believed hamadi shot stethem 
because hamadi seemed to enjoy inflicting violence on the 
passengers and crew

salvadoran presidential candidate fidel chavez 
mena said tuesday the nicaraguan government continues to support 
the leftist guerrilla movement in his homeland 
chevez mena candidate of the ruling christian democratic party 
in el salvador said the insurgents nonetheless are a far less 
potent force than they were earlier in the decade 
while giving no specifics chevez mena said the leftist 
sandinista government in managua continues to give support in one 
way or another to the rebels and have not concealed their 
sympathy for the insurgents program 
chevez mena a former foreign minister and planning minister 
told reporters the sandinistas have shown no inclination to abide 
by the provisions of the central american peace plan they signed 
last year 
i have to regret how nicaragua instead of making their 
process more flexible becomes more radical every day he said 
he said the peace accord signed by the regions five presidents 
deligitimized the rebel forces because it confirmed the need 
for democratic solutions to the regions problems 
one measure of how much the insurgent threat has been reduced 
chavez mena said is that he can travel almost anywhere in the 
country practically without risk 
chevez mena expressed confidence that he and his party will 
prevail in presidential elections next march 
in contrast to other contenders including the rightist arena 
party chavez mena said he represents the great center of the 
salvadoran political spectrum that reflects the sentiments of most 
of his countrymen 
he said the arena victory in legislative elections last march 
was a punishment vote against the christian democrats based on 
the partys inability to move quickly enough to solve economic and 
social problems 
he acknowledged that unemployment and other social problems 
remain acute but said the salvadoran people will take the vote for 
president next year more seriously and will give the christian 
democrats another fiveyear term in office

the house passed legislation tuesday barring 
airlines aircraft manufacturers and other aviation companies from 
retaliating against employees who complain to the government about 
safety problems 
the measure prohibits employers from firing or taking other 
actions against workers who notify government agencies about what 
they believe are safety problems or who refuse to allow an 
aircraft to operate because they believe a hazardous condition 
exists 
the bill passed on a voice vote gained momentum this year 
after lawmakers heard from workers including pilots and other 
employees of eastern airlines who complained that pressure was 
placed by management on those who object to safety problems 
it is imperative employees feel they can come to the federal 
aviation administration or to congress with their safety concerns 
so the traveling public can be protected said rep glenn 
anderson dcalif chairman of the house public works and 
transportation committee 
the bills future is uncertain because there is no similar 
senate version there is a much broader senate measure that would 
protect all privatesector whistleblowers including aviation 
industry workers but that bill seems unlikely to pass this year 
the house bill would allow workers to appeal to the labor 
department if they believe they have lost their jobs or been 
punished because they complained about safety problems 
a party dissatisfied with the labor secretarys decision could 
appeal to an administrative law judge within the department and 
ultimately to the courts 
if a worker is found to have brought his complaint in bad faith 
the employee can be held liable for the companys legal fees up to 
5000

the jordan times liberal progovernment of amman sept 10 
the performance of both us presidential contenders before 
bnai brith last wednesday was a misfortune for american 
statesmanship the two gentlemen acted more like gladiators than 
responsible leaders of their respective parties 
their willingness to outbid one another in support of israel 
and its bankrupt policies shocked all of us who watched it with 
dismay and disbelief mr bush assured the jewish constituency in 
the united states and through them israel that under his 
administration the united states would neither accept an effective 
united nations role in settling the arabisraeli conflict nor 
accept a palestinian state in the west bank 
his reasoning was unfortunate and untenable interpreting un 
involvement in the middle east peace process as tantamount to 
imposing a solution on israel is most regrettable calling any 
future palestinian state a threat to israel is also unwarranted 
how can a truncated and demilitarized state pose a threat to 
israel a country with nuclear capabilities 
by insinuating that such a state would also threaten the 
security and stability of jordan mr bush went beyond the realm of 
reality 
gov dukakis sadly attempted to outbid mr bush in support of 
israel for by asserting that washington will never accept a 
solution to the arabisraeli conflict no matter how just and 
legitimate if it is rejected by israel mr dukakis has 
permanently mortgaged his countrys national interests to israel 
 
it is sad to see wouldbe statesmen so lose sight of all 
longterm interests their own included in the shortterm hunt for 
votes

children and monks joined thousands of 
striking civil servants who marched through rangoon on tuesday to 
demand the government resign and be replaced by an interim 
administration to supervise multiparty elections 
opposition leaders told a new parliamentappointed election 
commission that neither they nor the people will accept elections 
organized by the government 
international telephone and telex lines from rangoon were cut 
off tuesday but it was not known if they were deliberately 
disrupted since communications with burma normally are poor 
residents of the capital were hoarding food and cutting down on 
rice consumption as transportation strikes pushed up the prices of 
essential items about 75 people including two buddhist monks 
began a twoday prodemocracy hunger strike outside city hall on 
monday more than 1000 children ending a 36hour fast gathered at 
the rangoon general hospital shouting give us democracy and 
give us interim government 
tens of thousands of striking government workers students 
medical personnel children and monks staged peaceful 
demonstrations in rangoon tuesday against president maung maung and 
his ruling burma socialist program party 
opposition leaders aung gyi aung san suu kyi and former defense 
minister tin oo told the election commission they rejected the 
governments promise to end 26 years of oneparty rule and hold 
elections as early as late october 
the three told the commission that polling could not be held 
amidst the countrys political turmoil and violence aung gyi said 
and that they will not support or participate in elections 
organized by the government in a letter to maung maung on monday 
the opposition demanded an interim government 
the three leaders also said it would be unfair to hold the 
elections before opposition groups form parties and raise funds to 
compete against ruling party candidates staterun radio rangoon 
reported 
aung gyi said he told election commission chairman ba htay a 
retired financial commissioner under a pre1962 civilian government 
i know you and i respect your integrity and i am confident you 
want to hold a free and fair election but after 26 years of this 
rule most people in the country do not know you and will not have 
confidence more so people do not trust any governmentappointed 
commission like the other four elderly commission members ba 
htay is regarded as politically neutral 
in this city of 35 million strikes by transportation workers 
and a lack of fuel have restricted food deliveries from the 
countryside the resulting shortages and an increase in the price 
of staples such as rice have forced residents to eat porridge or 
gruel and to hoard food 
a 44pound bag of rice that cost 170 a month ago now costs 
580 said a western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
he said gasoline was selling for 16 a gallon on the black market 
compared to 1 a year ago

when former prime minister u nus clean antifascist peoples 
freedom league won a landslide victory over an armybacked party

military crushed dissent and pursued rigid policies that made 
burma once one of asias richest countries one of the worlds 
poorest nations 
in september 1987 students staged riots against the 
governments economic policies followed by widespread protests in 
march and in june after ne win resigned july 23 the party chose 
hardliner sein lwin to succeed him after only 17 days in office 
and massive antigovernment protests sein lwin was replaced on

a federal judge has thrown out a 4 billion 
libel lawsuit brought by the inventor of the nautilus exercise 
machine who claimed he was defamed in a 2020 news program 
nothing in the episode damaged arthur jones reputation us 
district judge elizabeth kovachevich said in a ruling last week 
jones said tuesday from his ranch near ocala that his attorney 
would appeal 
im not happy with the judges ruling in a case where 
were patently right and theyre patently wrong he said well 
take it clear to the supreme court if we have to 
the broadcast concerned jones attempts to save 63 baby west 
african elephants by flying them from zimbabwe to his ranch the 
elephants had been slated for slaughter to control the size of the 
herd 
in 1984 2020 broadcast a segment about jones efforts to 
save the animals in a march 1987 followup the abc show revealed 
some elephants were being sold from jones ranch 
reporter roger caras said several elephants had gone to small 
circuses a fate worse than death in an onair exchange with 
anchor barbara walters caras said jones should have kept the 
elephants for good as had been implied from the beginning 
jones was quoted as saying that he did not have control of the 
animals at the time they were being sold because he was selling 
business assets but the company buying the assets told abc it was 
not responsible for selling the elephants 
two weeks after the segment aired jones sued saying the show 
deliberately made him seem dishonest and cruel 
the court finds that a reasonable person would not have 
intrepreted the broadcast in whole or in part as being 
defamatory ms kovachevich wrote she found that the statements 
in the broadcast were either constitutionally protected opinion or 
not damaging to jones reputation

the most seriously mentally ill patients in 
the united states tend to get the worst treatment largely because 
so many good psychiatrists leave public hospitals to make more 
money in private practice two advocacy groups contended tuesday 
the lack of adequate services for the seriously mentally ill 
is the major failure of american medicine and social services 
the public citizen health research group and the national alliance 
for the mentally ill said in a report 
dr sidney m wolfe cofounder with ralph nader of the public 
citizen health group called for using the leverage of federal 
funding to force psychiatrists to devote a certain amount of time 
to working in public mental health facilities 
at a news conference and in a subsequent interview wolfe said 
medical schools in general are more heavily subsidized by federal 
money than other professional schools and that psychiatric training 
is the most heavily subsidized of the medical specialities 
its almost impossible to get competent psychiatrists in 
public practice in some states said e fuller torrey a 
psychiatrist and a coauthor of the report he said it would not be 
too much to require psychiatrists to devote four or five hours a 
month to public practice in return for having their education 
subsidized by tax money 
the report itself said the failure to provide adequate care is 
particularly striking since we now know that the majority of these 
people can be successfully treated and rehabilitated 
expanding on a ranking system first used in 1986 a new survey 
by the groups concluded that rhode island wisconsin new 
hampshire maine vermont and connecticut are the best at providing 
services 
lowestrated in the survey were hawaii arizona the district of 
columbia delaware wyoming idaho and mississippi 
but torrey said being at the top of the list was not much to 
crow about when most are giving third and fourthclass care 
states that are delivering secondclass care look pretty good its 
a little like being the smartest kid in the dumb class at school 
he said 
the report said in general it can be said that hospital care 
for the seriously mentally ill in state mental hospitals is 
somewhat worse than it was two years ago while outpatient services 
are modestly better 
rehabilitation services and housing for the seriously mentally 
ill remain on the best of days seriously deficient and on the worst 
of days abysmal it said 
the reasons for the general deterioration of hospital care 
center primarily on staffing deficiencies especially in nursing 
and psychiatry the report said in both cases the 
deficiencies are being exacerbated by the mushrooming of private 
psychiatric hospitals which are taking the best staff from the 
public sector with the lure of higher wages 
it attributed marginal improvement in outpatient services to 
increased public attention to the sorry plight of the homeless 
mentally ill an issue which has moved from the back alleys and 
grates of the city to the front pages of its newspapers 
the report said conservative estimates suggest that nearly 2 
million people in the united states are seriously mentally ill 
with 8 percent of them hospitalized 
approximately onethird of homeless individuals are seriously 
mentally ill the report said their visibility on americas 
streets is a poignant reminder of the debacle of 
deinstitutionalization and failure of federally funded community 
mental health centers 
laurie m flynn director of the national alliance for the 
mentally ill noted that her organization is made up of 70000 
families of people suffering from mental illness 
for us the lack of services is a personal and family 
tragedy she said 
the overall state rankings were based on a composite figure 
drawn by awarding points ranging from zero to five in each of four 
categories hospital care outpatient services rehabilitation and 
housing 
the report relied on questionnaires to state mental health 
directors various government surveys and visits to 35 states and 
the district of columbia the report said 82 percent of the state 
mental health directors returned ninepage questionnaires when 
guaranteed anonymity even though their national organization did 
not endorse the survey

data collection methods included questionnaires to state mental

when states have an equal number of points they were ranked 
according to per capita income with poor states ranked higher on 
the assumption that all other things being equal wealthy states 
should do better than poorer states 
the number in brackets is the 1986 ranking the groups said

some changes in position rather than actual improvement or

the senate bowing to a veto threat and the 
houses will today retreated from its position that the federal 
medicaid program should fund abortions for poor victims of rape and 
incest 
the senate voted 4743 to drop an amendment that would have 
liberalized the current policy of federal funds only when abortion 
is necessary to save a womans life 
in july the senate voted 7319 to expand medicaid to pay for 
abortions in promptly reported cases of rape or incest states 
would have had the option of retaining the current more limited 
policy 
the abortion controversy had been holding up a massive 140 
billion spending bill meant to keep the departments of labor 
health and human services and education in business during fiscal 
1989 which starts oct 1 
the bill contains money for college loans disadvantaged 
children job training and aids research and education among other 
things 
president reagan has repeatedly said he would veto the entire 
laborhhseducation appropriations bill if it came to him with the 
senate abortion provision the latest threat came in a letter sept 
7 to congressional leaders 
the house on friday refused 216166 to go along with the senate 
expansion 
three hours of often emotional debate preceded todays vote 
with some senators decrying abortion and others maintaining that 
poor women in desperate circumstances deserve access to a legal 
medical option 
the question is is a child conceived by rape any less of a 
human being than one who is not said sen jesse helms rnc 
one atrocity doesnt justify another rape doesnt justify 
murder 
sen lowell weicker rconn countered that it defies all 
common sense not to permit federal payments for the most narrow 
exceptions under the most extraordinary and dismal of 
circumstances 
fourteen states and the district of columbia pay for medicaid 
abortions but only receive federal reimbursement for 
lifethreatening cases the senate vote in july was the first time 
since 1981 that either chamber had approved more liberal 
eligibility

here are major provisions of the fair housing 
amendments act of 1988 which president reagan signed into law 
tuesday 
protection against housing discrimination would cover the 
disabled and handicapped and families with children under age 18 
current law already protects against discrimination because of 
race sex religion or national origin 
the secretary of the department of housing and urban 
development would try to win a conciliation agreement after a 
complaint if filed if that effort fails the secretary or any 
party could take the case to an independent administrative law 
judge in hud or to a us district court 
if the administrative judge finds that someone has engaged or 
is about to engage in a discriminatory practice he shall order 
appropriate relief which may include actual damages an injunction 
or civil penalties 
the maximum fines would be 10000 for a first violation 
25000 for a second violation within a fiveyear period and 
50000 for two or more violations within a sevenyear period 
civil penalties ranging from 10000 for a first offense to 
100000 for succeeding offenses would be authorized in cases where 
a pattern or practice of discrimination has been proved 
the administrative law judges ruling would be subject to 
review by a federal appellate court 
a us district judge could impose the added penalty of 
punitive damage 
new buildings with four or move units must be constructed so 
they are readily accessible to the handicapped doors must be wide 
enough to accommodate wheelchairs switches and outlets must be in 
accessible locations bathroom walls must be reinforced to allow 
for installation of grab bars this would apply to dwellings set 
for occupancy 30 months after the laws enactment 
disabled tenants would have the right to make reasonable 
modifications to a dwelling at their own expense the tenants would 
have to agree to restore the property to its original condition 
when they leave 
children could be barred from housing intended for the elderly 
but that would be the only exception to an openhousing policy for 
those 18 and under housing for the elderly is defined as a 
community where at least 80 percent of the dwellings are occupied 
by at least one person age 55 or older and significant facilities 
and services are provided or those occupied solely by people age 
62 and older

the house of representatives trying to juggle 
a political hot potato broke with tradition tuesday by opening its 
session with recitation of the pledge of allegiance 
speaker jim wright said the pledge which has become an item of 
controversy in the presidential campaign would be recited on the 
house floor at the beginning of each days session until congress 
adjourns next month 
but wright dtexas also lashed out harshly at republicans who 
have sought to make the pledge an issue saying such efforts are 
childish immature and meanspirited as a person can be 
rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss held his hand over his 
heart as he led about three dozen lawmakers in reciting the 31word 
pledge montgomerys podium was turned sideways from its normal 
position so he could see the large us flag that hangs behind the 
speakers chair 
the pledge was to be led on wednesday by rep jerry lewis 
rcalif with democrats and republicans alternating days through 
the end of the session the members in the chamber tuesday appeared 
to be roughly equally divided between the two parties 
rep john rowland rconn who brought the pledge squabble to 
the house chamber last week called it a historic moment and said 
he would press to make the recitation a daily fixture wright 
promised that such a rules change would be considered through 
normal channels 
i compliment the speaker for recognizing that the dignity and 
integrity of the house would be enhanced by the recitation of the 
pledge of allegiance at the beginning of each session day 
rowland said 
the pledge has become the centerpiece of an argument begun in 
the presidential campaign over whether democrats or republicans 
are more patriotic 
republican nominee george bush began the fight by criticizing 
democrat michael dukakis for vetoing a bill in 1977 that would have 
penalized teachers for not leading the pledge in massachusetts 
schools dukakis the governor said he vetoed the bill because it 
was unconstitutional and has labeled bushs attack a mccarthyite 
tactic 
wright also repeated his belief that attempting to use the 
pledge as a political weapon is mccarthyism a reference to the 
fervently anticommunist senator who impugned many americans 
patriotism in the 1950s 
the pledge wright said is like the daily prayer that opens 
house sessions its a personal matter and members are free 
not to do so if they choose i dont think its up to me to go 
around and see whose lips are moving he said 
republicans appeared to delight last week when rowland surprised 
the chambers democratic leadership and sought a sudden rules 
change to make the pledge permanent the move was defeated on a 
226168 vote largely along party lines 
without mentioning rowland wright today said the idea of 
trying to use the pledge as a wedge of division among americans is 
what i regard as mccarthyism 
he added to suggest that another political party is less 
patriotic is childish immature and meanspirited as a person 
can be 
rowland rose after the pledge was recited today to add that he 
agreed with wright that it should not be confrontational 
congress formally endorsed the pledge in a 1942 law and the 
words under god were added in 1954 by a second law but the 
31word sentence has not been a part of the chambers own routine

dan quayle ridiculed michael dukakis 
national security credentials tuesday with jokes about the 
democratic nominees rubber duck naval adviser and foreign 
policy dealings limited to his new hampshire neighbors 
at a rally of several hundred supporters in bismarck the 
republican vice presidential candidate said dukakis was 
dangerously naive on national security and the most 
antidefense candidate on a national level since george mcgovern 
earlier quayle told backers in the milwaukee suburb of 
wauwatosa it was shocking that dukakis found it necessary to 
receive defense briefings last weekend from members of congress 
he doesnt know enough about national defense said the 
indiana senator he has to stop in and ask members of congress 
that ive been working with for the past 12 years 
on a day when dukakis delivered a major speech on ussoviet 
relations in chicago quayle said the massachusetts governor 
doesnt have the understanding or qualifications to run for 
president 
want to hear a sad story about the dukakis campaign quayle 
asked 
the governor of massachusetts he lost his top naval adviser 
last week his rubber duck drowned in his bathtub quayle said to 
roars of laughter from his audience at bushquayle campaign 
headquarters for wisconsin 
dukakis press secretary dayton duncan responded in chicago that 
quayles trying to call attention to his age quayle is 41 
republican nominee george bushs running mate then headed for 
colorado on a western campaign swing that focused on jobs economic 
prosperity and a strong defense 
the republicans have tried to portray dukakis as weak on defense 
and foreign policy issues and have criticized his opposition to 
the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles and president reagans star 
wars plan for a spacebased missile defense 
you dont learn what you need to know about the national 
security of our nation in one weekend cram course said quayle 
referring to dukakis weekend meetings with sen sam nunn dga 
and rep les aspin dwis chairmen of the senate and house armed 
services committees 
the closest thing he dukakis has to foreign policy 
experience is dealing with the governor of new hampshire quayle 
said 
he accused dukakis of having a midnight conversion on 
defense presumably a reference to a recent apparent softening in 
the governors opposition to star wars 
he didnt just find religion he found his poll numbers 
quayle said 
he noted that zbigniew brzezinski national security adviser to 
former president carter had endorsed bush who named brzezinski on 
monday to a 13member panel of campaign advisers on national 
security 
dr brzezinski is willing to put his reputation his 
integrity to support george bush quayle said the reason 
he made that decision is because he knows the governor of 
massachusetts he knows what kind of a president he would be

voted to impeach or convict evan mecham last spring were challenged 
by candidates loyal to the ousted governor

policies angered fellow republicans faced newcomer michael griffes 
in the senate primary democrat william gray a former us 
attorney had no primary opposition 
proxmires retirement in wisconsin after 31 years in the senate 
sparked spirited races in both parties on the democratic side the 
latest newspaper polls showed earl and milwaukee bucks basketball 
team owner herbert kohl leading a fourway race that included 
former deputy attorney general edward r garvey and secretary of 
state douglas la follette 
kohl who had never before sought public office spent nearly 
21 million much of it on tv ads and drew criticism from his 
rivals that he was trying to buy the election 
republicans chose between state sen susan engeleiter a 
moderate and the more conservative stephen b king former gop 
state chairman 
in new hampshire gregg son of a former governor faced former 
manchester mayor robert shaw and political neophyte william

stafford a republican and proxmire a democrat were among six 
senators three from each party to retire this year democrats 
now control the senate by a margin of 54 to 46 
there was irony in the highstakes campaign to succeed the 
72yearold proxmire who had become famous for his lowbudget 
campaigns and congressional budgetcutting efforts in winning 
reelection 1982 proxmire said he spent 14510 some of it for 
postage to return contributions 
kohl a former chain store owner was by far the leader in 
spending followed by 431000 by earl 360000 by garvey and 
15500 by la follette as of aug 24 election board records 
showed 
in the gop race king 47 a former fbi agent and onetime 
chairman of the republican party of wisconsin sought to pin a 
liberal tag on engeleiter 36 a veteran of 11 years the 
legislature and the senates minority leader 
king stressed his opposition to a tax increase and abortion and 
his support for the death penalty engleiter who said she had the 
backing of a broader segment of the party said she had spent much 
of her legislative career fighting against increased taxes 
king criticized engeleiter for running for the senate when she 
has two small children at home 
motherhood also became an issue in new hampshire where sen 
gordon humphrey who endorsed douglas for congress created an 
uproar last week when he said tamposi shouldnt run because she has 
a 22monthold daughter humphrey apologized two days later 
douglas won endorsements from nationally known conservatives 
including sen orrin hatch of utah and rep jack kemp of new york 
in vermont griffes called himself the real republican in the 
race to succeed the 75yearold stafford who served as governor 
and congressman before entering the senate in 1971 
jeffords support of democratic initiatives over the years 
angered many of the gop faithful including former fourterm gov 
richard snelling who donated 1000 to the griffes campaign 
in 1981 jeffords was the sole house republican to vote against 
reagans taxcut package in 1987 he had the secondhighest 
antireagan voting record among republicans in the house as 
analyzed by congressional quarterly magazine he opposed the 
president on 71 percent of the key votes

havana radio on tuesday blamed a shadowy defector 
and british intelligence for an incident in which a cuban diplomat 
in london pulled out a gun and fired shots at people he said were 
menacing him 
britain ordered cubas ambassador oscar fernandezmell and the 
cuban embassys third secretary carlos manuel medina perez to 
leave the country monday in the wake of the shooting 
a statement by the the british foreign office expelling the two 
cubans said the government would not tolerate the use of firearms 
by diplomats 
the foreign office said medina perez told police he fired 
because he was afraid for his safety it said he was released from 
police custody after he claimed diplomatic immunity 
governmentoperated havana radio blamed cuban defector 
florentino aspillaga lombard for the shooting saying he tried to 
strongarm medina perez into defecting 
in a broadcast monitored in miami the radio station said 
aspillaga defected from the cuban embassy in prague 
czechoslovakia in june 1987 to put himself at the service of the 
us central intelligence agency 
aspillaga along with three men and a woman approached medina 
perez and tried to persuade him to defect the government radio 
said 
the traitor aspillaga threatened medina perez to make him 
desert said havana radio in response carlos medina perez 
drew the gun he was carrying and fired against the traitor and the 
whole group ran away

totally in the hands of the cia and under strict security measures 
could travel to great britain and carry on this type of action 
against a cuban diplomat without the cooperation of the british 
intelligence service and british authorities 
the radio called perezs expulsion deeply unfair and 
arbitary saying it was aimed at hiding cooperation between 
british intelligence and the cia in the affair

injured in the shooting and were satisfied he was not posing a 
threat to anyone scotland yard police headquarters said it would 
not release the mans identity adding the police inquiry into the

senate republicans proposed a series of 
education employment and health initiatives tuesday aimed at 
ensuring that hispanics have access to the opportunities and 
support systems already available to most americans 
but the democratic chairman of the congressional hispanic 
caucus rep albert bustamante of texas said there was not 
really any substance to that report and that its findings were an 
election yeartype of rhetoric 
they need a primer on understanding the issues because they 
always vote wrong on the issues im happy to see theyve at least 
put a position out there he said calling the 1980s really and 
truly a disaster for hispanics 
but another hispanic leader rita di martino of staten island 
ny board chairman of the the national council of la raza and new 
york state republican party vice chairman said the report dealt 
meaningfully with the issues affecting hispanics the nations 
fastestgrowing population group 
we have some very important people on this task force this 
is a first this is historic said ms di martino a member of 
the task forces bipartisan advisory committee 
sen orrin hatch rutah chairman of the panel said many of 
the recommendations could be accomplished with legislation while 
the executive branch would be encouraged to take action with 
through executive orders 
he said the task force had already backed efforts to provide 6 
million to fund national and local hispanic literacy programs 
bustamante challenged the senate republicans to do more and 
back up their promises with discretionary funds for programs and 
minority contracts benefiting hispanics 
the report said education is the most critical issue in the 
hispanic community unless literacy and dropout rates are turned 
around it said young hispanics will not be able to find jobs as 
the united states evolves from a manufacturing to a technology and 
servicebased economy with greater needs for workers with higher 
skills 
studies show hispanics are the least educated major population 
group in the country the study said 
the task forces recommendations include 
expanding national and local initiatives to reduce illiteracy 
and combat a high hispanic student dropout rate 
advocating programs at the federal state and local levels and 
in the private sector that provide managerial skills assistance to 
small minority businesses 
pursuing an aggressive trade policy with mexico to benefit 
businesses on both sides of the border 
improving the recruitment of qualified hispanics into 
managerial and professional positions in the private and public 
sector 
promoting health and disease prevention efforts with an 
emphasis on fighting aids and increasing the number of health care 
professionals serving the hispanic community and increasing 
hispanic input in health care policy issues 
supporting better access to bonding and insurance for small 
businesses

standing on south africas doorstep 
pope john paul ii called on the people of this desert nation 
tuesday to assist victims of racial discrimination who are 
deprived of their legitimate rights 
the pope on a oneday visit to diamondrich and bonedry 
botswana praised the nation as an island of peace in a troubled 
sea 
botswana a landlocked country of 11 million people has never 
fought a battle in its 22 years of independence despite bordering 
such turbulent places as angola mozambique southwest africa and 
south africa 
you are a peaceloving and friendly people who believe in the 
basic equality and human dignity of every man and woman the 
pontiff told about 2000 people who greeted him at the airport 
including a choir of barebreasted teenage schoolgirls 
later in a speech at the cathedral of christ the king the 
pontiff clearly referred to south africa and its apartheid policies 
of racial segregation without mentioning the country by name 
you have witnessed the plight of those who are subjected by 
law to discrimination the pontiff told the audience in gaborone 
10 miles from south africas northern border i gladly support 
your desire to be close to those who are unjustly deprived of their 
legitimate rights and lack decent living conditions 
the pope arrived tuesday from zimbabwe the first stop on his 
fivenation tour of southern africa 
he travels wednesday to lesotho a mountain kingdom surrounded 
by south africa where he is likely to make additional comments on 
apartheid the pontiff is not visiting south africa on this trip 
but the vatican has said he may do so in the future 
at an afternoon mass in botswanas national stadium john paul 
renewed his call for regional peace to a crowd of 50000 more 
than botswanas entire catholic population of 45000 several 
thousand of those attending were from south africa according to 
church officials 
what are the causes of humanitys fears the pontiff said 
it is the absence of justice and peace in our lives and in the 
world that so often troubles us and arouses our fears 
nation still lifts sword against nation there is much 
training for war he said 
south africa has raided botswana several times in past years 
killing alleged guerrillas of the african national congress 
the pope was serenaded by several hundred members of a womens 
choir and received gifts from catholic parishes around the country 
two parishes from western botswana brought crosses they had carried 
by foot and car across the kalahari desert which makes up 80 
percent of botswana 
botswana has a westernstyle multiparty democracy a rarity in 
africa diamond mines make it relatively wealthy on the continent 
but it remains heavily dependent economically on south africa 
on papal matters the vatican said tuesday the pope would return 
to africa next year with stops in tanzania and the island nation 
of madagascar 
there has been speculation that the trip expected next may 
also may include angola and south africa vatican spokesman joaquim 
navarrro traveling with the pope said neither country was on 
the program although he confirmed that angolan bishops had 
recently sent an invitation to the pope

mario biaggis campaigns for congress have been 
pretty dull affairs the last couple of decades hes won every one 
by a landslide this year biaggi hopes for something new he hopes 
to lose 
at least he says he hopes to lose nothing comes at face value 
in bronx politics a world where tempers run hot bad blood runs 
deep and rap sheets serve as the nearest thing to a score card 
what is certain is that the race for biaggis seat is one of the 
oddest in years even by bronx standards a month ago convicted of 
corruption biaggi quit his office now he just might win it back 
what weve got there are pretty unique circumstances said 
raymond smock historian of the house of representatives without 
checking he said the last case of an unwilling winner to spring 
to mind occurred in 1788 
of course biaggi has yet to win and his opponents in the 
democratic primary predict he wont people have a lot of 
affection for him said state assemblyman eliot engel but 
theyre not going to vote for him 
some will biaggis focus on constituent services made him 
immensely popular in his district which takes in much of the north 
bronx and yonkers he won each of his last six races with at least 
90 percent of the vote 
indeed his career came to an end at the jury box rather than 
the ballot box twice in the past year he was convicted of federal 
corruption charges and he was facing expulsion from the house when 
he tearfully quit last month 
in addition to resigning his seat i am withdrawing as a 
candidate for reelection he said at the time i will not 
campaign i will not run 
but neither of his opponents in the primary thursday is remotely 
as well known as biaggi even a strong sympathy vote conceivably 
could win him the nomination and because democrats outnumber 
republicans 31 in the district the democratic nominee generally 
wins the seat in any case there is only one candidate on the 
republican line mario biaggi 
the issue goes beyond biaggi the bronx democratic organization 
has been shaken by recent corruption convictions of party leaders 
if biaggi won and declined to serve the organization could 
reassert itself by naming its own candidate to run in a special 
election which are held without primaries 
borough president fernando ferrer who presents himself as a 
reformer was concerned enough this week to warn voters away from 
biaggi we in the bronx have worked hard to recover our lost 
respect he said lets not lose an opportunity to better the 
bronx by throwing away a vote 
one issue is why biaggi remained on the ballot at all he did 
not contest his opponents court challenge of his nominating 
petitions hoping said his lawyer to be thrown off the ballot 
but the state board of election already had ruled the petitions 
valid and without evidence otherwise the court upheld it 
biaggis federal prosecutor expressed a dim view of the suggestion 
that he move out of state as a ploy to disqualify himself and with 
no other legal reason for the court to remove him from the ballot 
he stayed on 
a victory by one of the challengers would make the matter moot 
engel a state assemblyman since 1977 has won all the key 
endorsements also running is a former assemblyman vincent 
marchiselli who has sought to link engel to the discredited party 
organization 
the fight has been hostile though traditional issues have 
hardly figured in it the race itself is the issue marchiselli 
charged that engel sought secretly to keep biaggi on the ballot so 
biaggi and marchiselli would split the italianamerican vote 
engel meanwhile charged that politicians who want the seat were 
conducting a whispering campaign to win votes for biaggi so the 
party would designate them to run in a special election 
biaggi who faces sentencing for his latest conviction next 
month is keeping quiet he declined to be interviewed and a 
spokesman bob blancato would refer only to the resignation 
statement saying he would not campaign 
at the juncture where we are that stands blancato said 
after thursday there may be a need for a new statement

an appellate court heard arguments tuesday 
that the federal communications commission decision to abolish the 
fairness doctrine for broadcasters both hurt and advanced the cause 
of free speech 
the requirement that television and radio stations present 
opposing viewpoints on controversial questions was a prevalent 
deterrent to broadcasters to air public issues fcc general 
counsel diane s killory told a panel of the us circuit court of 
appeals here 
elimination of the doctrine would best further the publics 
interest in recieving robust debate on controversial issues she 
told the threejudge panel which is reviewing last years 40 fcc 
vote abolishing the fairness standard 
the fcc found that because there were so many sources of 
information the 38yearold fairness doctrine was no longer needed 
to ensure the dissemination of all points of view in the debate on 
a public issue she said 
enforcement of the fairness doctrine prompted many broadcasters 
to avoid controversial issues so they would not be required to air 
all sides to a question and the result was bland speech she said 
but andrew schwartzman executive director of the media access 
project accused the fcc of ignoring abundant evidence that many 
broadcast outlets had not presented alternate points of view on 
controversial subjects 
there was a blatant predisposition to reach this result the 
fcc has flipflopped he told circuit judges patricia wald 
kenneth starr and stephen williams 
why shouldnt an agency that now says were concerned about 
core first amendment values get credit for that starr asked 
its one thing for the fcc to say its sensitive to first 
amendment concerns schwartzman said but he accused the agency 
of conducting a onesided and narrow review 
if it found that the regulation had a chilling effect on free 
speech the commission is free to tinker with the adminstration 
of the fairness doctrine he said its very convenient outcome 
for the fcc to say there is a very chilling effect we have to 
throw out the whole thing 
but killory argued that stricter enforcment would require the 
fcc to get into the editorial judgment of broadcasters 
the fairness doctrine requires broadcast stations to present the 
opposing viewpoint on a controversial issue in the event that the 
other side had purchased advertising to promote its arguments 
the doctrines constitutionality was upheld by the supreme court 
in 1969 but in 1984 the high court said it would review that 
decision if presented with new evidence that enforcement was no 
longer necessary 
the next year the fcc concluded the doctrine no longer served 
the public interest but said it would continue its enforcement 
because of uncertainty over whetherit was legally binding 
in 1986 the federal appeals court here found that the fairness 
doctrine was not codified as part of the 1959 communications act 
meredith corp then challenged the constitutionality of the 
fairness doctrine after the fcc found that a station it owned in 
syracuse ny had filed to present opposing views about the 
construction of a nuclear power plant 
the appeals court ordered the fcc to consider merediths 
constitutional challenge a review that resulted in the aug 4 
1987 vote to abolish the doctrine 
floyd abrams a prominent first amendment lawyer who represents 
meredith urged the panel to defer to oldfashioned commission 
expertise which found that the public is receiving information 
not because of the fairness doctrine but in spite of the fairness 
doctrine 
communications attorney timothy dyk predicted the case will 
turn on a constitutional issue i think this is a case for the 
supreme court 
organizations supporting the cc included the national 
association of broadcasters the reporters committee for the 
freedom of the press and the american newspaper publishers 
association

the cuban embassy charged tuesday that its 
commercial attache who was expelled along with the ambassador 
opened fire on a cia operative who had tried to get him to defect 
the commercial attache third secretary carlos manuel medina 
perez and the ambassador oscar fernandezmell left london 
tuesday on a scheduled flight for prague en route to the cuban 
capital havana 
in a statement read on the embassy steps first secretary 
roberto de armas charged that the central intelligence agency 
operative was a former cuban diplomat who defected in june 
florentino azpillaga lombard 
de armas claimed british and us secret services had worked 
together during the incident the british foreign office was 
enraged by the shooting because of its strict ban on diplomats 
carrying arms 
the traitor in a menacing way instructed senor medina perez to 
defect said de armas in reply to this he took out the gun he 
was carrying fired it and the group ran away 
london police said in a statement that antiterrorist squad 
detectives traced and interviewed a man slighted injured in the 
monday afternoon shooting and we are wholly satisfied he was not 
posing a threat to anyone 
we will not be releasing his details the statement from 
scotland yard police headquarters added following the action of 
the foreign office the inquiry is now closed officials at 
scotland yard refused to elaborate 
the foreign office told ambassador fernandezmell he must take 
responsibility for medina perez being armed but the ambassador 
told reporters at the airport that he found his swift ousting 
very strange 
the british domestic new agency press association said police 
sources confirmed that the wounded man was a security officer 
and part of a team keeping the diplomat under surveillance 
witnesses have said that medina perez who opened fire outside 
his apartment in west london shot at a group of three men and a 
woman who fled in a car he was stopped by police claimed 
diplomatic immunity and then told the foreign office he fired 
because he was in fear of his life 
the foreign office refused to comment on the reports that the 
communist diplomat was under british or us security surveillance 
we have reacted appropriately to a totally unacceptable and 
outrageous action on the streets of london said a spokesman who 
according to british civil service practice declined to be 
identified 
havana radio in a broadcast monitored in miami said aspillaga 
defected from the cuban embassy in prague czechoslovakia in june 
1987 to put himself at the service of the us central 
intelligence agency 
the radio called the expulsion of medina perez deeply unfair 
and arbitary saying it had absolutely nothing to do with the 
incident 
since a policewoman was shot and killed by a gunman firing from 
the libyan embassy at demonstrators in april 1984 the foreign 
office has taken a harsh attitude towards violations of its blanket 
ban on embassies having guns 
the cubans were expelled within days of a vietnamese diplomat 
being ordered out for brandishing a gun at demonstrators outside 
his embassy 
in normal circumstances british policeman are not armed a fact 
which heightens official anger at guntoting diplomats 
in his statement cuban diplomat de armas said the alleged cia 
operative could not have entered britain without collusion between 
the us and british authorities he demanded to know what had 
happened to the wounded man and why the british authorities refused 
to identify him 
it is possible now that both the british authorities as well 
as the british and american secret services will find themselves in 
an embarrassing situation when they explain what really happened 
said de armas 
the expulsions mean cuba has 12 diplomats left in london 
britain has five diplomats in havana

in pennsylvania where the seriousness of 
radon contamination first came to light when a man set off 
radiation alarms at a nuclear plant the state is moving to 
regulate companies that test homes for the deadly gas 
the steps are the outgrowth of nearly four years experience with 
radon an odorless colorless gas the environmental protection 
agency has now linked to 20000 lung cancer deaths a year 
nationwide the epa said monday every home in the country should be 
tested for radon because contamination is wider spread than 
previously believed 
radon is a radioactive gas trace amounts of which are produced 
in the decay of uranium in soil and rocks the gas is present in 
the outdoors normally at about 05 percent of the epas 4 picocurie 
action level homes tend to concentrate radon indoors 
radon kills people by leaving its radioactive decay products in 
the lungs irradiating the tissues for a lifetime 
pennsylvania will require companies testing for the gas to pass 
a stateapproved course in radon detection demonstrate at least a 
year of professional experience and agree to provide radontesting 
data to the government said jason j gaertner a state department 
of environmental resources official 
after sept 21 it will be illegal to provide radon services 
in the state unless they are certified he said tuesday 
its simply a health issue which needs to be investigated 
house by house gaertner said the problem levels are 
sprodadic but in being sporadic theyre spread across the entire 
country there arent really bad areas there are problem homes 
gaertner who works in the ders bureau of radiation protection 
said his office received a tremendous number of calls tuesday 
because of the epa report 
what we are really telling them is the same message we have 
been giving the public for a year now gaertner said that 
message based on der data from the past is that problem homes can 
occur anywhere in the state but most people after testing dont 
have a problem 
in neighboring west virginia the state health department said 
it had received more than 50 calls by midday tuesday from 
residents concerned about the effects of radon gas 
what the people are mainly concerned about is how they can get 
the radon kits to have their homes tested said rod kovack a 
radiological technician for the health department weve been 
furnishing them with a list of places where they can obtain the 
kits and along with that list weve sent a couple of pamphlets 
that the epa has put out for concerned homeowners 
the pennsylvania department plans to publish guidelines for 
contractors and homeowners on specific remediation techniques for 
homes with unacceptable radon levels gaertner said a companion 
booklet will offer tips on selecting contractors along with a list 
of statecertified contractors he said 
this will help the public in that the industry will be 
regulated he said we havent seen severe problems but you 
want to make sure problems dont occur that the firms have proper 
training and that they are following the proper methods for 
remediation 
of the 429 pennsylvania homes tested in the national survey 
released monday 37 percent had more than 4 picocuries of 
radioactivity per liter of air the level used by the epa as the 
trigger for more sophisticated tests that determine if remediation 
is needed the highest level was 114 in perry county 
those readings contrast to levels in the thousands of picocuries 
found previously in the uraniumrich reading prong geological 
formation of eastern pennsylvania northern new jersey and new 
york gaertner said 
those earlier findings were accurate but rare he said 
what it did was present a distorted picture of the radon 
situation he said the highest reading we have encountered 
outside the reading prong is no more than 800 and now we do a 
statistically random study and the highest reading is 114 
on dec 14 1984 stanley watras a field engineer for a 
subcontractor building philadelphia electric cos limerick nuclear 
plant tripped radiation alarms as he went to work 
investigators discovered his home atop the reading prong had 
radon levels 675 times the acceptable state guidelines he and his 
family were evacuated 
the discovery awoke scientists and officials to the severity of 
radon contamination in some areas and led to the creation of the 
radiation bureau in gilbertsville about a two miles from watras 
home

consumers planning to test their homes for 
radon in the wake of the report by the federal environmental 
protection agency can get some free help through state agencies and 
the epa 
stephen page of the epas radon program said homeowners or 
renters should get a copy of the citizens guide to radon 
available through state agencies or an area epa office the guide 
outlines steps consumers should take when using one of the several 
commercially available home testing kits 
before purchasing a home kit page said people should check 
with a list of 216 companies that have passed the epas proficiency 
test also it is important to carefully follow kit instructions 
because even a slight deviation can easily alter the results he 
said 
if the reading is 4 picocuries or higher page suggests a 
followup test 
bill belanger the epas regional radiation representative for 
pennsylvania said homeowners also can buy for 400 a continuous 
radon monitor that uses electronic detectors to count the 
disintegration of radon particles 
once the level is known several steps can be taken to alleviate 
the problem 
one method called subslab ventilation is used in homes with 
the highest levels and costs 800 to 1500 it involves poking a 
hole in the basement floor and inserting a polyvinylchloride pipe 
that leads to the attic or the outside where a fan carries away the 
gas this can reduce the radon level by as much as 99 percent page 
said 
two other relatively easy methods are sealing the sump pump or 
ventilating crawl spaces 
a third method caulking any cracks in the basement floor 
should almost always be used in conjunction with another method he 
added 
jason j gaertner a a pennsylvania department of environmental 
resources official in gilbertsville the states central office for 
radon issues said pennsylvania is one of two states with a radon 
certification program for companies providing radon services 
kits staff visits remediation and supplies companies are now 
applying for certification and by the winter the der should have 
published a list of certified firms

the senate surrendered to political reality 
tuesday and gave up its fight to permit federally funded abortions 
for poor victims of rape and incest 
facing strong house opposition a white house veto threat and 
the prospect of a 140 billion social spending bill held hostage to 
the abortion controversy the chamber agreed by voice vote to scrap 
its position 
the vote came after two roll calls in which members first 
refused 4644 and then agreed 4743 to kill a motion to insist 
on allowing federal medicaid payments for abortions in promptly 
reported rape and incest cases 
abortion was the only area of disagreement between the two 
chambers in the huge spending bill for the departments of labor 
health and human services and education 
the house rejected the senate view last friday voting 216166 
to continue the current policy of federal funds only when an 
abortion is needed to save a womans life 
sen lawton chiles dfla chairman of the subcommittee that 
handled the spending bill pleaded with his colleagues to accept 
defeat and help enact the overall measure 
were talking about a house that were 50 votes short in 
were talking about a president thats going to veto the bill 
were talking about a clock thats ticking chiles said you 
can stand on principle forever and youll have nothing if you 
dont know when you have to close that gap 
the senate voted 7319 in july to expand medicaid to pay for 
abortions in rape or incest cases that are promptly reported 
states would have had the option of retaining the current more 
limited policy 
the abortion provision was part of the 140 billion 
laborhhseducation measure for fiscal 1989 which begins oct 1 
the bill contains money for medical research job training college 
loans and programs for disadvantaged children among many other 
items 
in a sept 7 letter to congressional leaders president reagan 
reiterated his intention to veto the entire package if it came to 
him with the senates abortion provision 
the senate language would permit the use of federal funds for 
the salughter of unborn children depriving the innocent of the 
most basic of civil rights the right to life reagan wrote i 
urge the congress to vote to protect the lives of americas unborn 
children 
the rhetoric on the senate floor tuesday was equally intense 
sen barbara mikulski dmd a social worker said she vividly 
recalls the coathanger abortions suffered by poor women without 
access to the highpriced society doctors willing to perform 
underground abortions 
abortion is a legal medical procedure that is now available to 
women who are welloff denying it to poor women is discrimination 
pure and simple she said mikulski also said that making a woman 
bear the child of her attacker is grotesque and inhumane 
but sen jesse helms rnc argued that a child conceived by 
rape is not any less of a human being than one who is not one 
atrocity doesnt justify another rape doesnt justify murder 
sen lowell weicker rconn who launched the crusade for wider 
federal abortion coverage excoriated the administration for 
pressing congress to the wall on the issue 
theyre going to use their last gasp and their last piece of 
political capital to deny abortions to rape and incest victims 
weicker charged what a legacy for an outgoing president 
weicker who is up for reelection this year acknowledged in 
advance that he was beaten on the floor vote but he added i 
think its important that the record be established so people 
understand how they can respond on election day 
the national righttolife committee termed the senate and house 
votes a sharp setback for the proabortion movement groups and 
said the administrations support had been extremely helpful 
fourteen states and the district of columbia pay for medicaid 
abortions but only receive federal reimbursement in 
lifethreatening cases the senate vote in july was the first time 
since 1981 that either chamber of congress had approved more 
liberal eligibility

nearly half the nations highachieving 
teenagers knew someone who committed suicide or tried to and 30 
percent said theyve considered killing themselves according to a 
survey released tuesday 
a separate survey of adults found that a third of them knew a 
teenager who committed suicide or tried to 
you dont have to be a psychologist to realize all of the 
things that are crashing in on these kids today said paul 
krouse publisher of the directory whos who among american high 
school students which conducted the survey of teenagers 
the survey polled 2024 teenagers listed in the directory and 
found that 45 percent said they knew a teenager who had attempted 
suicide or succeeded four percent said they had tried it 
krouse said tuesday he believed the findings would be much 
higher in a survey of the general teenage population 
high achievers likely are less vulnerable than a general teen 
audience because they have much more success and they seem to be 
coming from more stable family backgrounds where there is more 
parental involvement he said 
a separate national survey of 1000 adults questioned by the 
national association of private psychiatric hospitals found that 
27 percent said they knew a teenager who had tried to commit 
suicide and 17 percent knew a teenager who had succeeded 
charles riter of riter research the annapolis md company 
that conducted the survey said there was some overlap between the 
two groups and that 32 percent knew a teenager in one of the two 
categories 
the other survey teenagers at risk an adult perspective 
found that 724 percent of those interviewed believe teenagers 
today face more serious problems than they did at the same age 
in the whos who survey the percentage of those polled who knew 
someone who had tried or committed suicide was down from 48 percent 
in 1987 but the polls margin of error was 2 percentage points 
krouse said 
the survey also showed the problem may be especially serious 
among black high achievers the company said 
it found that 10 percent of the black highachievers polled this 
year said they had attempted suicide five percent of those 
surveyed were black 
asked what factors contributed most to teenage suicide 86 
percent of the high achievers said a feeling of worthlessness 84 
percent said a feeling of isolation and loneliness 72 percent said 
pressure to achieve and 65 percent said a fear of failure 
most of those surveyed said they felt suicide prevention 
hotlines awareness programs for teenagers and their parents and 
private counseling in school would help combat the problem 
students with grade point averages of a or b can be nominated 
for listing in the whos who high school directory the most recent 
directory listed about 575000 students said spokesman michael 
sadowski 
the whos who survey also found that 
drug use continues to decline among the nations brightest high 
school students with less than 1 percent reporting they smoke 
marijuana more than once a month thats down from 4 percent five 
years ago and 11 percent a decade ago 
alcohol use also is decreasing with 63 percent saying they 
never drink alcohol compared with 50 percent in 1978 and 48 
percent in 1983 
about 75 percent said they had never had sexual intercourse 
fortyeight percent believe schools should dispense condoms to 
curb the spread of aids and 49 percent believe schools should 
provide other contraceptives to reduce the number of pregnancies 
twentyeight percent said they dont approve of abortion under 
any circumstances while 22 percent said they approved of abortion 
at a womans discretion 
thirtytwo percent said they support republican george bush for 
president 23 percent favored democratic nominee michael dukakis 
10 percent liked former democratic candidate jesse jackson and 30 
percent were undecided

the first marines sent to 
help battle forest fires that have charred nearly 1 million acres 
of yellowstone national park arrived tuesday as the wet weather 
that has helped quiet flames began to lift 
the marines will help bolster sagging firefighter numbers in the 
park and provide relief for fire crews that have been on fire lines 
for some time said bob valen of the national park service 
we knew we were losing our crews he said some of them 
have been out there way past the usual 21day assignement some 
need to get back to college so were rotating a lot of crews out 
about 550 marines flew into west yellowstone mont from camp 
pendleton calif to help the estimated 7200 firefighters still 
in the park battling fires that have plagued northwestern wyoming 
since early july 
however marines will have received only two days of training 
before they are placed on fire lines and will have to be 
accompanied by seasoned firefighters valen said putting 
additional pressure on fire personnel 
in all 1200 marines are being sent with 1400 army soldiers 
due from fort lewis wash to double the number of military 
personnel assigned to the fires 
by tuesday the fires had blackened 939270 acres of the 22 
millionacre park fires in the national forests and parks 
surrounding yellowstone in wyoming montana and idaho bring the 
total burned acreage to 14 million acres 
fires also burned tuesday in northern california where 8000 
people were evacuated from communities in an area northeast of 
sacramento oregon washington and utah which had its last big 
fire almost under control at 8500 acres washington states biggest 
fire in colville national forest was declared contained at 20126 
acres 
controversy has surrounded the yellowstone fires because of the 
park services let burn policy of not fighting most fires that 
start naturally in past years such fires have remained small but 
critics blame the policy for letting fires get out of control in 
this unusually dry summer 
president reagan said tuesday he had not been aware of the 
policy but said interior secretary donald hodel told him we were 
withdrawing this policy 
colorado gov roy romer said democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis would join him wyoming gov mike sullivan montana 
gov ted schwinden and idaho gov cecil andrus on thursday to 
survey fire damage in yellowstone and discuss policy 
romer said dukakis was changing his campaign schedule for the 
meeting dukakis campaign headquarters in boston had no immediate 
comment about any yellowstone appearance said a media assistant 
tripp jones 
rain that had fallen on parts of yellowstone since saturday 
tapered off tuesday but had continued longer than expected the 
forecast called for partial clearing by wednesday and for 
temperatures to rise to the low 70s by thursday 
but the weather remained cool enough tuesday that officials 
began distributing coldweather gear donated by residents of 
communities around wyoming to firefighters 
few firefighters had been prepared for the cold wet weather 
that limited fire activity and the salvation army and other 
organizations started collecting coats and other clothing to send 
to fire camps 
firefighters continued to take advantage of the cool weather to 
strengthen fire lines in anticipation of the warmer drier weather 
the fires are still a threat we are not out of it yet said 
fire information officer sonya capek we know there is some more 
fire time left in the season but hopefully it wont be as 
intense 
along the north side of the park in montana school resumed 
tuesday in gardiner the parks northern entrance after being 
closed monday but an evacuation plan was ready in case fires 
advanced said janet mcbride of the gallatin national forest 
near cooke city and silver gate just outside the parks 
northeast tip rehabilitation work has already begun along fire 
lines flanking the 81400acre storm creek fire which threatened 
the towns for several days last week 
information officer ted coffman said crews were smoothing dirt 
over bulldozed lines repairing creek drainages and planting some

mikhail s gorbachev got an earful of complaints 
about housing and food problems in siberia for the second day in a 
row tuesday and then tore into local officials for mismanagement 
i felt that its already impossible to talk to the people 
the soviet leader said in a meeting with local officials in the 
city of krasnoyarsk 
wherever i was on the street in a factory or here the 
people are simply at your throat and i think theyre right 
his comments were included in an hourlong report about his visit 
on the soviet television evening news program vremya the visit 
has received heavy tv coverage emphasizing the importance of his 
message 
the official soviet news agency tass said kgb chief viktor 
chebrikov also a member of the ruling communist party politburo 
discussed housing and other problems of everyday life on tuesday 
with workers in the far east port of vladivostok 
the public appearances by both men seemed to be part of a 
kremlin effort to show concern about poor living conditions 
gorbachev has made the issue of improving the daily lives of 
average soviets a key element of his policy of perestroika or 
restructuring of soviet society he has said he is not satisfied 
with the efforts made so far 
the politburo has called for building enough new housing to give 
every family its own apartment by the year 2000 
local officials tried to explain their approaches to solving the 
regions problems but were clearly embarrassed by gorbachevs 
criticism 
one krasnoyarsk official told gorbachev that krasnoyarsk 
residents receive the governments recommended yearly allotment of 
154 pounds of meat but the soviet leader retorted that people 
laugh at such standards 
he said chinese and japanese eat much less meat but everyone 
who goes there says everything is on the shelf to buy thats the 
story people are laughing at these scientifically based norms 
soviet citizens shown on televised reports of gorbachevs 
frequent visits around the country usually praise his policies or 
ask uncritical questions 
but gorbachev ran into loud complaints about life in krasnoyarsk 
upon flying to the siberian city about 2000 miles east of moscow 
following a sixweek vacation 
he said the slow rate of development in the huge krasnoyarsk 
region was a constant topic of concern in moscow the region 
encompasses onetenth of the entire soviet union produces half of 
its coal and 20 percent of its forest products 
gorbachev said the government has invested billions of rubles in 
the area and is getting little in return 
he told workers at the khimvolokno synthetic fiber factory in 
krasnoyarsk that the politburo was giving special attention to a 
shortage of kindergartens 
tass quoted one worker as shooting back we have 
kindergartens we dont have housing and the medical facilities 
are bad 
gorbachev heard similar complaints monday when he stopped in 
yemelyanovo village on his way to kransoyarsk from the airport 
after arriving from moscow 
we have no hot water you do what you can to wash one man 
shouted at the 57yearold communist party chief 
ill tell you right off comrades that we cannot count on 
successful perestroika if the people have got so many 
problems piling up to form a single big problem that of inadequate 
social amenities gorbachev said 
he spoke frequently about environmental problems criticizing 
gigantomania the propensity to build huge factories and power 
stations regardless of their impact on the environment 
too often projects carried out under the flag of communism 
threaten nature and the interests of the people are considered 
last he said 
tass said that on chebrikovs visit to vladivostok workers at 
the dalvostok ship repair yard complained about work and living 
conditions medical care shortages of consumer goods and cultural 
amenities

the federal equal employment opportunity 
commission has ruled that a literacy test all texas teachers were 
required to pass to keep their jobs discriminated against teachers 
who were black or over 40 
state officials said they do not agree with the ruling and plan 
to negotiate with the eeoc in an attempt to modify or reverse the 
decision 
a summary of the eeoc ruling was released by the texas state 
teachers association 
we said all along that the test was discriminatory toward 
blacks and older teachers said ollie besteiro vice president of 
the texas state teachers association 
this means that school districts will have to go back and 
review their records to see which former teachers might be eligible 
for reinstatement back pay or pension adjustments besteiro said 
in the spring of 1986 teachers and school administrators had 
two chances to pass the texas examination of current administrators 
and teachers or tecat 
out of the estimated 200000 teachers and administrators in the 
state 1875 failed the test and were not qualified to work in 
texas schools that fall 
failure rates for blacks and older persons indicated that the 
tecat adversely impacts on blacks and persons within the protected 
age group under federal law who were either applicants or 
employees for teaching positions in the texas public school system 
in 1986 the eeoc said 
state figures showed a passing rate for whites of 999 percent 
compared to 989 percent for hispanics and 954 percent for blacks 
state education commissioner william kirby challenged the eeoc 
decision said the same statewide results showed that 9929 percent 
of educators under age 40 passed the test while 9964 percent of 
teachers over 40 passed 
older educators did better on the test than younger ones the 
results clearly refute the contention that the test discriminated 
against individuals on the basis of age he said tuesday 
the test was a fair and accurate measure of the examinees 
basic reading and writing skills that was in no way influenced by 
race or age kirby said 
he said another federal agency the office of civil rights had 
looked at the test and found no evidence whatsoever of racial 
discrimination 
the eeoc ruling was made in response to complaints filed by 
several of the failed teachers against their school districts the 
state and the state board of education which approved the content 
and passing score of the exam 
the teachers association represented the teachers before the 
eeoc 
david thompson legal counsel for the texas education agency and 
the state board of education argued the eeoc erred in its findings 
about the literacy test 
we dont think their findings are factually or legally 
valid he said i think they got their facts wrong and failed 
to consider some legal precedents that affect the case 
state attorneys are negotiating with eeoc officials before 
taking any action said thompson 
kirby said eeoc officials had asked for additional information 
including the civil rights report we are confident they will 
revise their decision when they review the complete information 
he said

a federal jury tuesday found seven former and 
current police officers guilty of 55 counts charging them with 
accepting more than 18000 in bribes from restaurants and bars to 
overlook violations and perform special services 
the jury had deliberated for six days the seven officers showed 
little or no emotion as the verdicts were read 
each officer was convicted of two counts under the federal 
racketeering statute or rico which carries a maximum sentence of 
20 years in prison and a 250000 fine some defendants also were 
found guilty of federal extortion charges substantive mail fraud 
and mail fraud conspiracy 
in all the officers were found guilty of 55 counts of a 
58count indictment 
during closing arguments two weeks ago special prosecutor james 
b farmer of the new england organized crime strike force said the 
case was about misuse of office for personal gain its about 
each one of them using their power as boston police officers to 
line their own pockets 
but defense attorneys argued that the money accepted from 
business owners that led to the indictment was just christmas and 
vacation gifts from people with whom the officers worked closely 
over several years 
defense attorney anthony cardinale called the governments 
allegations of racketeering a gossamer web that would collapse 
under careful scrutiny 
cardinale admitted his client detective john f mccormick 
accepted 400 for himself from a bar manager on two occasions but 
cardinale said mccormick did not conspire with the other defendants 
and was not guilty of racketeering or extortion 
my client in accepting money was wrong but it was not a 
felony this was not an illegal conspiracy he said during the 
trial cardinale said the officers deserved disciplinary action 
from their department but were not racketeers 
the seven officers convicted tuesday were john e carey thomas 
j connolly mccormick matthew a kilroe peter boylan francis x 
sheehan and kenneth j nave 
much of the prosecutions case revolved around tape recordings 
made by the manager of the 1270 a downtown nightclub joseph 
mcgowan became an fbi informant 
defense attorneys challenged mcgowans credibility saying he 
had lied about being in the marines and about being blind in one 
eye

the environmental protection agency on tuesday 
issued a 370page set of regulations that requires almost all 
owners of underground tanks including the corner gasoline station 
to test and protect their tanks fix leaks and clean up spills 
one set of requirements applies to all tanks installed after 
december of this year another set gradually applies to the nearly 
2 million existing tanks 97 percent of them holding gasoline or 
other petroleum products and makes them generally meet the new 
tank standards in december 1998 
the first requirement to bite is that existing tanks more than 
25 years old must have leak detection systems which may be 
inventory checks and annual tightness tests installed in the 
coming year with the requirement applying to the youngest tanks in 
1993 corrosion protection systems and spill and overfilling 
prevention devices would be required only in 1998 
about 80 percent of the tanks in use are steel tanks without 
protection against rust epa says its surveys show that anywhere 
from 10 percent to 30 percent of the 750000 tank locations have 
or have had significant leaks 
only about 5 percent of existing tanks have leak detection 
systems 
the regulations four years in the drafting require 
doublewalled tanks or similar doublebarrier protection only for 
some 60000 chemical tanks and one environmental group immediately 
criticized the agency for the omission 
failure to require double barriers for petroleum product tanks 
means epa is leaving the us supply of drinking water vulnerable 
to petroleum contamination said staff scientists lois epstein of 
the environmental defense fund 
the regulations are designed to minimize their impact on the 
regulated community not to protect the environment and the public 
from the hzards of petroleum contamination she said 
but j winston porter assistant epa administrator with 
jurisdiction over the tank program said that secondary 
containment is quite expensive and would add unspecified billions 
to the cost of the final regulations 
one of his staff david obrien said a doublebarrier 
requirement would add 80000 to the cost of a new threetank 
service station and existing stations would have to rip out all 
their tanks if the requirement were imposed on existing 
installations 
such a station might have to spend 3000 to 8000 on a leak 
detection system and 10000 to 48000 on an electrical 
rustprevention system epa estimated 
as it stands the agency estimated that tank owners will have to 
spend the equivalent of 54 billion in todays dollars but the 
owners and society will reap 73 billion worth of benefits in 
reduced damage inventory losses and cleanup costs it did not 
present an estimate of the extra costs and benefits associated with 
double barriers nor did it estimate health benefits from less 
contamination of groundwater 
whether youre mom and pop or exxon it doesnt make a lot of 
sense to keep a leaking gasoline tank in the ground the liability 
is enormous porter said 
about a dozen states already have tank regulations of their own 
in place and part of tuesdays regulatory package was the 
announcement of procedures by which states can win approval of 
those programs from epa 
a state does not have to have a program at all which would 
leave epa to enforce the new regulations porter said the agency at 
this point had made no provision for operating tank programs and 
we hope very few states will opt out 
still to come in about six weeks are regulations prescribing 
financial responsibilities of tank owners epa administers a 500 
million fund to help pay for cleanups 
the regulations exempt septic tanks tanks of 1100 gallons or 
less storing fuel for farm or noncommercial use home heating oil 
tanks and tanks on basement floors which are considered 
aboveground tanks 
the regulations take effect 90 days from publication expected 
soon in the federal register

a judge on tuesday sentenced a woman and her 
three sons to life in solitary confinement at separate prisons so 
they will understand the pain of separation felt by the 
families of the three police officers they killed 
wayne county circuit judge richard p hathaway also said he 
wished he could have imposed the death penalty on alberta easter 
and her sons george roy and william lemons 
michigan does not have the death penalty 
easter and her sons killed three inkster police officers during 
an 11hour hostage siege on july 9 1987 
sgt ira parker and officers clay hoover and daniel dubiel were 
killed when they tried to serve a bad check warrant on easter all 
three were taken hostage in adjoining rooms of the motel in the 
detroit suburb where easter and her sons were staying and were 
found dead of multiple gunshot wounds when the four surrendered 
the actions on july 9 are a disgrace to the word family i 
only wish the victims families could step forward and sentence the 
defendants instead of the court hathaway said 
in a 10minute statement to the court easter passionately 
maintained her innocence 
our blood is on your hands you pray for us and our lives 
she said 
all three sons expressed remorse for the slayings but maintained

president reagan said tuesday that vice 
president george bushs child care plan would help provide children 
with tender loving family care while the democratic plan 
favored by michael dukakis would lead to licensing grandmothers 
bush the republican candidate for president has proposed a 
plan to give tax credits of up to 1000 to assist families with 
child care the money could be used either to pay for outside child 
care or to enable a mother to stay home and take care of her 
children instead of working 
dukakis the democratic presidential candidate has endorsed a 
bill by sen christopher dodd dconn providing for the federal 
government to reimburse providers of child care the providers 
would have to meet federal standards in order to receive the funds 
dodd said recently that bushs proposed tax credit was as 
likely to be used for household expenses as for care of children 
and would fall far short of the 3000 average annual cost per 
family for child care he also said it would fail to repay the 
wages lost by a mother who stays home 
but reagan speaking at a rose garden ceremony at which he 
signed a proclamation setting the current week aside as national 
hispanic heritage week said bushs plan will allow parents to 
choose among a variety of options if they need child care 
assistance 
experts tell us what common sense always has the best people 
to take care of children are family members the president said 
and thats the kind of care that george bushs plan will help 
provide tender loving family care 
now compare this plan with the one offered by the liberals 
theyve written a bill that gives assistance not to the parent but 
to the person who provides the care and why because they want to 
make sure that they have control over the kind of care your child 
receives 
and that means if you want to leave your child with his 
grandmother during the day she will have to be licensed under 
federal standards if shes to be given assistance for helping to 
raise her grandhild licensing grandmothers can you believe it 
well i think its terrible and i dont think the american people 
are going to stand for it 
dodd commented no one is worried about the kinds who are left 
in their grandmothers care in a perfect world every infant and 
every young child would have a parent or grandparent who could stay 
at home and look after him 
what we are worried about and what the act for better child 
care services will address is the millions of children whose 
parents dont have that option who work for a living and have to 
leave their kids in the hands of strangers in day care centers 
and family day care homes thats where we need at least some 
minimum health safety and competency standards 
jason isaacson press secretary for the senate subcommittee on 
children and the family headed by dodd said it was true that a 
grandmother would have to meet federal standards in order to 
receive funds under the bill 
how else can you design a program that receives federal 
funds he asked you just cant give federal funds out without 
some assurance that they are not going to be used for child neglect 
and abuse we are not worried about grandmothers we are worried 
about 16 and 17yearolds and people who have no training and no 
qualifications

the soviet union has bought an additional 
350000 metric tons of us corn for delivery during the coming 
year the agriculture department said tuesday 
the sale brought total corn sold to the soviets in the last two 
weeks for the 198889 delivery year that started sept 1 to more 
than 295 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 350000 tons of 
corn would be about 138 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 273 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 38 million 
as with the other recent sales no indication was given whether 
the new sales of corn to the soviets would count under the current 
longterm grain supply agreement between the two countries or be 
carried forward separately in case a new pact is forthcoming 
the current fiveyear pact is set to expire sept 30 and 
negotiators are trying to work out a new one or at least an 
extension of the current agreement to take effect on oct 1 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
prior to sales announced since sept 1 the soviet union had 
purchased 905 million tons of wheat and 517 million tons of corn 
for delivery in the fifth year of the agreement plus 830000 tons 
of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal

an agriculture department proposal to allow up 
to 10 percent salvaged meat and tiny bone chips in hot dogs without 
telling consumers about it on product labels was made over the 
objections of a white house regulatory aide documents disclosed 
tuesday 
jay plager administrator of information and regulatory affairs 
in the office of management and budget told usda in a letter aug 
19 that the proposed rule change does not appear to be consistent 
with several of the administrations basic regulatory principles 
nor does it appear that the potential benefits to society of 
this regulation outweigh the potential cost to society plager 
added 
christopher hicks the usdas general counsel replied that 
department officials do not agree with the conclusions set 
forth by plager 
there are compelling reasons for proposing this rule 
including the fact that it may produce benefits to society that 
outweigh societal costs hicks told plager in a sept 6 letter 
copies of the letters by plager and hicks were provided to the 
associated press 
advocates of the rule change contend that consumers wont buy 
products containing the salvaged material if labels inform them 
about it 
the proposal which began a 60day rulemaking procedure sept 9 
was announced monday by the departments food safety and inspection 
service 
it involves the use of mechanically separated meat or msm 
although current regulations describe it as mss to acknowledge 
the species of animal involved thus salvaged meat from a hog 
would be mechanically separated pork or msp 
according to the plan which will be open for public comment 
until nov 8 processors would be able to use mss to comprise up 
to 10 percent of the meat in franks bologna luncheon meats 
sausage and similar products without stating so on product labels 
however the label would have to indicate the percentage of the 
recommended daily allowance of calcium that the product contained 
calcium is a primary ingredient of bone tissue 
regulations limit the salvaged product to no more than 075 
percent calcium but bones are about onefourth calcium so that 
would translate into a maximum of about 3 percent bone 
the american meat institute a private association that 
represents meat packers and processors said in a statement that 
the use of calcium on labels would be a more meaningful and 
useful term to consumers than mss particularly to those who 
have a calcium deficiency and to a few who are allergic to calcium 
and should be warned away from such products 
there is no wholesomeness or safety issue involved in the 
mss proposal the institute said in the brief statement citing 
the departments own description of the product as safe and 
wholesome as the species from which it is derived 
but plager said the assertion that consumers would avoid 
products labeled as containing mss had not been documented in the 
proposed rule change 
furthermore if one accepts the assertion that some consumers 
would be reluctant to purchase a product that they know to contain 
mss why should this information be omitted from the label he 
said would its omission in other words be inconsistent with 
the fsis food safety and inspection service obligation to prevent 
labels that are false or misleading and hence contrary to fsis 
statutory mission to protect the public from misbranded items 
plager said that in seeking ways to carry out less burdensome 
food safety regulations we must also provide consumers with 
more rather than less information about food products so that 
they may reach informed market decisions 
under current regulations mss can comprise up to 20 percent 
of the meat portion of these products but the labels must state 
that the products contain mss 
the department said that under the proposed rule change which 
was sought by a group of meat processors and supported by the trade 
mss would not have to be listed in the ingredients statement 
on the label as long as it does not exceed 10 percent of the meat 
portion of the finished product 
when animals are slaughtered most of the red meat is cut or 
scraped from bones by hand but a lot of edible tissue clings to 
the bones and gristle particularly in neck bones ribs joints and 
other hardtoscrape places 
the bones and the attached meat remnants are put through a 
grinder and forced through fine sieves although most of the bones 
are strained out the resulting mixture still contains bits of bone 
about the size of ground pepper 
according to the meat processors who asked usda for the rule 
change no company at present is commercially producing mss for 
consumer products because of unwarranted negative connotations 
associated with the term mss 
under various names mss has been authorized for use in the 
meat products since 1978 and has undergone numerous legal 
challenges from consumer groups opposed to the salvaged product 
itself or labeling requirements

the pentagon has recreated a tiny slice of 
the soviet military machine to serve as a mobile laboratory for 
testing american weapons and equipment 
the unusual amalgamation of enemy gear is now undergoing its 
first operational test at kirtland air force base nm the 
pentagon announced tuesday 
known formally as the mobile integrated threat test the setup 
replicates a key slice of a soviet army headquarters and division 
organization and uses real enemy equipment obtained through a 
variety of means officials said 
most of the equipment is electronic primarily radar and radio 
gear but mig jet fighters also will be used in simulating the 
threat force the pentagon added in a statement 
the us military has long conducted tests and experiments with 
pieces of military equipment made in the soviet union warsaw pact 
and third world countries and then captured stolen or covertly 
purchased 
what makes the new effort different is an attempt to combine the 
radar radios and targeting equipment into the type of 
integrated system that us forces would face on a battlefield 
also setting the work apart is the creation of a small 
organization known as the defense test and evaluation support 
agency that is responsible for operating the gear and playing the 
enemy 
were not reinventing the wheel bits and portions of this 
have been done in the past said james wilson the director of 
the mobile integrated threat test 
what were going to offer is the ability to deliver set up 
and operate this enemy gear for testing us systems were 
trying to come close to the real thing the gear we have is not 
stateoftheart but its still in use within the warsaw pact 
the tests now under way at kirtland are designed to demonstrate 
that a relatively large network of soviet equipment can be operated 
just like the russians would handle it once that goal is 
accomplished the support agency will respond to requests from the 
military services for assistance in checking out the effectiveness 
of various types of american equipment 
the kirtland tests which will run to early october will 
include some flights by soviet aircraft simulating closeair 
support missions as well as flights by new mexico air national 
guard a7 attack jets 
the a7s will be used to test the capabilities of the soviet 
sensors the pentagon statement said 
but this is not a traveling road show wilson said there 
wont be any dogfights or anything like that we dont want to 
oversell what were doing

in the battle for the white house one of the 
fiercest fights of all is being waged over defense with george 
bush accusing michael dukakis of opposing every military advance 
since the slingshot and the democrat claiming the republicans 
have neglected our troops in the field to pursue a nuclear 
shield in space 
by opposing the mx and midgetman missiles and ridiculing the 
strategic defense initiative as a fantasy dukakis has laid 
himself open to republican barbs that he would undermine american 
strength in arms talks with the soviets 
dukakis in turn has demanded that bush explain how he proposes 
to pay for all the weapons in the pentagon arsenal 
the massachusetts governor has launched a counteroffensive in 
recent days visiting an ohio plant that makes engines for the 
stealth bomber monday to dramatize his support for that 
radarevading plane 
on tuesday dukakis donned a helmet and rode in a m1 abrams 
tank at a general dynamics facility in sterling heights mich 
where he charged the reagan administration sought to cut tank 
production by a quarter 
well continue research on strategic defenses but were not 
going to waste hundreds of billions of dollars on a system our best 
scientists say wont work at a time when were shortchanging our 
troops in the field and mortgaging our future said dukakis who 
also planned a major address on defense in washington wednesday 
to date dukakis has been on the defensive in arguing that what 
the american military really needs is a conventional defense 
initiative to beef up its frontline forces in europe 
far from promising actual cuts in pentagon spending dukakis has 
suggested any savings on strategic weapons may be offset by the 
need to buy more tanks artillery and conventional weaponry 
bush meanwhile has had a field day making the rounds of 
military plants and bases pillorying a rival who gives me the 
impression hes opposed to every new weapons system since the 
slingshot and quipping that dukakis thinks a naval exercise is 
something you find in the jane fonda workout book 
but bush who has not suggested scrapping a single pentagon 
weapons program so far has not spelled out how he proposes to keep 
the 289 billion pentagon budget within the constraints of his 
socalled flexible freeze on all federal spending save social 
security 
regardless of who wins the next president will inevitably be 
faced with hard decisions on pentagon spending 
its been a dirty little secret of the reagan administration 
that for the whole second term the defense budget has undergone 
real declines said kenneth adelman reagans former director of 
the arms control and disarmament agency 
after doubling in his first four years the pentagon budget has 
fallen 10 percent in real dollars since 1985 it is still 53 
percent higher than before the carterreagan buildup 
but it would take a major new spurt in spending to get all of 
the major new weapons off the pentagons drawing boards and into 
the field or space 
lawrence korb a former reagan assistant secretary of defense 
said right now in defense you have a 400 billion program and a 
300 billion budget whoever gets in there is going to have to get 
that program down something will have to go 
the democrats platform calls for more stable defense 
budgets not cuts dukakis says his top priority will be to 
improve our conventional forces while negotiating sensible arms 
control agreements 
but building up that conventional strength will not be cheap 
korb director of the center for public policy education at the 
brookings institution estimates it would cost 5 billion for each 
extra day the us wants to be able to fight a conventional war in 
europe against the soviets 
adelman now vice president of the institute for contemporary 
studies said dukakis cannot save any money like he talks about 
by cutting down the strategic forces and pouring those funds into 
conventional forces theres not going to be that much to pour in 
strategic forces account for at the most 12 percent of the us 
defense budget eightyeight percent is conventional 
military analyst joshua m epstein said it is bushs figures 
that dont add up 
bush is talking about trying to drive eight lanes of traffic 
through a threelane tunnel as far as the pentagon budget is 
concerned he has just not realistically faced up to the budget 
constraints that will be imposed by congress said epstein a 
brookings senior fellow 
the extra five lanes are continuing funding at high levels for 
sdi following through on plans for a 600ship navy continued 
modernization of the strategic triad with not one bomber but two 
the b1 and the stealth the mx and midgetman missile a full 
trident submarine program said epstein 
if youre not prepared to cut some of these glamor programs 
then things like readiness and training and personnel and 
maintenance and conventional forces are going to take a beating 
he said 
dukakis has said he would continue basic star wars research at a 
reduced level of 1 billion less than a third of what is now 
spent he opposes a railbased mx missile system and the midgetman 
he favors scrapping plans to build two new supercarrier task forces 
that cost 18 billion each 
the massachusetts governor supports the radarevading stealth 
bomber which he boasted monday was started by a democratic 
president it was supported by a democratic congress and its going 
to be completed by my administration he also favors the d5 
submarine launched ballistic missile 
he charges that despite spending nearly 2 trillion on defense 
and increasing the us nuclear arsenal from 7000 warheads to 
12000 the reaganbush administration has left us armed forces 
short of spare parts and ammunition 
bush has committed himself to research testing and deployment 
of sdi as rapidly as possible but he cautioned last month that 
a full deployment would be very expensive 
bush pledges to support rail mobility for the mx missile he 
says the singlewarhead midgetman would be hard to locate and 
could enhance stability however it is very expensive

spectators and journalists in the traditional 
shuttle launch viewing area have one chance in a thousand of being 
killed from an outofcontrol rocket booster the air force said 
tuesday 
for that reason said col larry gooch visitors and more than 
half the journalists expected for the discovery liftoff later this 
month will be placed at a site 6 miles away from the launch pad 
instead of the usual 3 miles 
the chance of being killed by an exploding booster at the more 
remote site is hundred times less or one in 100000 said 
gooch the commander of the eastern space and missile center at 
cape canaveral fla 
the air force is responsible for safety in the entire area which 
is dotted with launch pads 
more than 3600 members of the news media already have applied 
for credentials and the total is expected to rise to more than 
4000 said nasa public affairs chief william sheehan 
he said all news media who need to be at the closein press site 
at the moment of launch will be accommodated the maximum number 
being about 1800 the journalists who will be moved will be those 
who dont have immediate deadlines such as weekly newsmagazines 
sheehan said 
he issued guidelines for credentials as many as 40 for each of 
the major television networks 10 for each wire service two each 
for daily newspapers six each for small television networks four 
each for radio networks three each for individual television 
stations and two each for individual radio stations 
the rest of the credentialed journalists will be put at the 
remote site where there are no telephones and only minimal 
services the general public which has turned out a million strong 
for some past launches on the roads near the kennedy space center 
will not be affected because admittance to the center is restricted 
the changes were ordered gooch said because the booster 
rockets did not tumble end over end when the challenger exploded 
but instead continued to fly in a missile mode 
in the case of the challenger they went out over the sea but 
if they had returned to land they would have had to be destroyed 
by command of the range safety officer scattering shrapnel over 
the area gooch said 
we can never guarantee absolute safety but we can minimize the 
risk by minimizing the number of folks said gooch 
jay greene a veteran shuttle flight director and chairman of a 
nasa risk analysis team said the risk hazard hasnt increased 
since the challenger accident we understand the risk better 
asked if the air force was imposing censorship under the guise 
of public safety gooch replied i believe we are addressing the 
safety issue

the house on tuesday approved legislation that 
would for the first time require all medical laboratories 
including nearly 100000 such labs in doctors offices nationwide 
to be federally licensed 
such laboratories perform four billion to six billion tests a 
year for diagnosis and monitoring of disease and some have been 
criticized because of rushed procedures that can lead to mistakes 
under the bill passed on a voice vote all medical labs would 
have to meet quality control personnel and equipment standards and 
would be subject to penalties for violations 
all laboratories would be licensed for two years at a time 
would have to pass proficiency tests and would have to meet 
specific stringent standards for evaluations of pap smears which 
are used to detect cervical cancer 
there have been charges that private labs that process thousands 
of pap smears daily have been careless in efforts to maximize 
profits and on occasion failed to spot cases of cancer 
backers of the legislation said there are some 4500 independent 
labs in the united states 6600 hospital laboratories and 98000 
labs in doctors offices the labs would be required to pay 
issuance and renewal fees for their federal certificates 
the measure now goes to the senate for further action the 
reagan administration has not expressed a position on the bill 
current law subjects hospital and independent laboratories to 
regulation but does not affect labs in physicians offices the 
bill would require doctorsoffice labs to be certified in order to 
receive reimbursement for medicaid and medicare cases beginning in 
1990 
certain relatively simple tests done in doctors offices such 
as pregnancy tests diabetes tests and certain urine tests would 
be exempted from the legislation

pope tutu clash said a 
headline tuesday in one south african newspaper tutu and pope in 
agreement said a headline in another 
the conflicting messages reflected the intense battle being 
waged by south african political factions to capitalize on pope 
john paul iis visit to five neighboring countries 
the pope is bypassing south africa but his comments on issues 
such as apartheid sanctions and political violence are being 
analyzed and interpreted here with great intensity and diversity 
progovernment media seized upon some of the popes comments en 
route to harare zimbabwe on saturday and suggested that he had 
repudiated anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
this interpretation was based on the popes unqualified 
denunciation of political violence and his reservations about 
sanctions and election boycotts 
tutu advocates sanctions and is urging a boycott of the upcoming 
segregated elections he has repeatedly condemned violence but says 
he understands how some south african blacks feel they have no 
other alternative in seeking to end whiteminority domination 
one progovernment paper beeld ran a cartoon tuesday showing 
tutu with a chain of bullets around his neck 
is this what your rosary looks like the pope asks tutu as 
they stand near a newspaper poster that reads pope strongly 
against sanctions and violence 
it is a pity that archbishop tutu was not in harare to hear 
the pope since he would have learnt what a man of such eminence 
has to say in leading the faithful on the paths of reconciliation 
and peace said the citizen a progovernment daily in an 
editorial monday 
but then the pope is a great religious leader whereas 
archbishop tutu has decided to involve himself in politics 
john paul also was praised by the staterun south african 
broadcasting corp in a commentary tuesday it contrasted his 
forthright declarations with the vagueness prevarication and 
endless qualifications from south african clergymen 
tutus spokesman john allen said there are no fundamental 
differences between the pope and the archbishop who met earlier 
this year at the vatican 
both oppose violence and agree that strategies such as sanctions 
and election boycotts should not be used indiscriminately if other 
effective tactics were available allen said 
the papal visit also has prompted ideological maneuvering in 
marxistruled mozambique john paul will travel there friday on the 
last leg of his trip 
the governmentbacked newspaper noticias in a frontpage 
editorial monday said the visit to mozambique proves that the pope 
sides with the peoples of southern africa in a struggle against 
the forces of colonialism apartheid and destabilization 
the editorial denounced the hesitations ambiguities or 
collaborationist silence of local roman catholic leaders who have 
urged the government to change its policy and negotiate with the 
mozambique national resistance guerrilla movement

the house passed by voice vote tuesday a bill 
setting up a new federal program to try to figure out what to do 
with the growing number of drugaddicted and aidsinfected infants 
abandoned in hospitals 
the bill is similar to legislation passed aug 5 by the senate 
minor differences between the two measures will now have to be 
resolved before each chamber votes again and sends the bill to 
president reagan 
the house bill authorizes 10 million in the next fiscal year 
for the department of health and human services to develop a 
program to deal with abandoned infants 
growing numbers of children are being abandoned in bigcity 
hospitals particularly in new york california and florida 
according to the report accompanying the legislation 
but there is no accurate number of abandoned children available 
in fact the legislation directs hhs to survey the program and 
report to congress 
the abandoned babies are children born of mothers who are drug 
addicts or infected with the aids virus both those conditions can 
be passed along to infants

appealing to vietnam to permit thousands of 
people who were detained in reeducation camps after the vietnam 
war to leave the country secretary of state george p shultz said 
tuesday the united states is prepared to accept up to 94000 
refugees during the next fiscal year 
but shultz said that number could be reduced to no more than 
70500 in the 1989 fiscal year beginning oct 1 if congress cuts 
president reagans budget requests 
we want to offer the opportunities of a new home in a new land 
to the masses of unfortunates who need and long for these 
privileges as were given to our own forefathers shultz told the 
senate judiciary subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the 
refugee program 
since october 1981 the united states has processed and admitted 
to the united states more than 400000 refugees from indochina 
200000 of them from vietnam shultz told the panel 
but he noted that for reasons not satisfactorily explained 
the vietnamese recently suspended cooperation with the united 
states on resolving the issues of americans missing or taken 
prisoner of war in vietnam and the resettlement of vietnamese who 
were sent to reeducation camps after the war 
we call upon vietnam to heal one of the most painful of wounds 
remaining from the war by responding favorably to the wish of 
thousands of reeducation camp detainees to be reunited with their 
families in the united states or to come with their families to our 
country shultz said 
we hope vietnam will lift its temporary suspension of 
cooperation with us on this compelling humanitarian issue he 
said 
shultz said last year the administration set refugee admissions 
numbers that were higher than the funds made avaiilable for the 
program by congress 
this led to confusion and disappointment as the year went on 
and the money ran out he said 
the house and senate versions of the bill funding the refugee 
program contain varying amounts 
shultz said that if the final bill provides 3384 million the 
same amount as last year that will be enough money to bring in 
68500 refugees with funds available from other sources to bring 
in an additional 2000 
a 3619 million appropriations would pay for resettling 82000 
refugees with funds avvailable from other federal and private 
sources to bring in a total 94000 he said 
at the higher level the government would plan to resettle in the 
united states 28000 vietnamese including 25000 amerasian 
immigrants shultz said 
he said that level of funding also would permit resettling 
24500 persons from the soviet union and eastern europe 7000 
people from the near east and south asia 3500 from latin america 
and the caribbean and 2000 from africa with 4000 refugees from 
all areas to be paid for by private sector contributions

the government said tuesday the opposition 
has broken terms set by solidarity leader lech walesa and the 
interior minister that talks on polands future be held without 
preconditions 
however government spokesman jerzy urban said he still hoped 
the talks would take place and be fruitful and a member of the 
ruling politburo said on staterun television that the talks still 
could begin within the next few days 
no date has been announced for the discussions which are to 
consider solidaritys status in addition to the enormous problems 
facing poland 
mieczyslaw rakowski the polish united workers communist party 
official in charge of propaganda said the politburo was informed 
at its normal tuesday meeting on preparations for the meeting 
we believe that if everything goes well the round table will 
still take place this week rakowski said 
urban complained that resolutions adopted by the opposition 
demanded legalization of the trade union solidarity before the 
talks begin 
it was accepted in the talk between interior minister 
czeslaw kiszczak and lech walesa that talks would be held without 
preconditions and limits on subjects urban said at his weekly 
news conference 
this arouses justified doubts about whether some of our 
potential partners at the round table really have a will for 
dialogue urban said 
urban was referring to a meeting convened by walesa at st 
brygidas church in gdansk over the weekend where opposition 
leaders called on the government to signal its readiness to 
create conditions for legalizing the union 
however they did not say they considered it an ultimatum 
solidaritys information commission responded to urbans 
comments on tuesday by saying the spokesman distorted the 
resolutions none of the aforesaid statements laid down any 
preliminary conditions 
urban also said there would be no meeting wednesday between 
walesa and kiszczak as proposed by solidarity officials to work 
out remaining obstacles to the talks but the government spokesman 
did not exclude a meeting later 
i can rule out in fact that this meeting will be held 
tomorrow wednesday in view of what i have said about the need for 
certain preparations for the fullscale talks he said 
after nationwide strikes the government agreed to the 
negotiations on aug 31 and promised they would cover solidaritys 
future the broader issue of union pluralism and workers 
grievances 
walesa then successfully persuaded strikers to end polands 
worst wave of labor turmoil in seven years to allow the talks to 
begin the government earlier said that talks would start 
automatically once the strikes stopped

united nations ten nations have called on the united nations 
to investigate claims that iraq used poison gas in an attempt to 
crush the kurdish rebellion in its country an official said 
tuesday 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar conveyed the request 
to iraqs charge daffaires ali mahmoud sumaida said un 
spokeswoman nadia younes 
herbert s okun the secondranking diplomat at the us mission 
to the united nations made the us request monday to perez de 
cuellar okun acted on behalf of the united states britain japan 
and west germany said a spokeswoman for the us mission who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the other nations who requested the investigation were italy 
norway sweden denmark finland and iceland she said 
in baghdad an iraqi official said tuesday his country probably 
would not admit the proposed united nations team to conduct the 
investigation 
this is considered a question of sovereignty and therefore i 
do not think we are going to accept that said the official who 
demanded anonymity 
iraq has denied charges that it used poison gas in a bloody 
offensive against kurdish guerrillas a minority people living in 
northern iran iraq and eastern turkey who are fighting for a 
separate homeland in northern iraq 
iraq acknowledged on july 1 that it used chemical weapons during 
its nearly 8yearold war with iran but claimed the iranians had 
used them first 
in washington secretary of state george p shultz said tuesday 
the united states has compelling evidence that iraq has used 
chemical weapons against its kurdish citizens but he said the 
united nations should conduct its own probe before being asked to 
condemn iraq for alleged genocide 
shultz said the united states reached the conclusion iraq was 
using chemical weapons against the kurds based on an examination of 
kurdish refugees in turkey and on other evidence which to me 
seems to be compelling 
about 60000 kurds recently fled iraq to turkey citing poison 
gas attacks 
i feel our evidence is quite convincing shultz said 
but were not in a position to make that public 
the evidence led the senate on friday to vote for tough economic 
sanctions against iraq the measure still must be approved by the 
house and signed by president reagan 
in geneva about 150 kurds demonstrated outside the un office 
tuesday calling for the world body to investigate the alleged gas 
attacks and shouting saddam assassin a reference to iraqs 
president saddam hussein 
in beijing on tuesday us ambassador to the united nations 
vernon a walters said the united states is determined the use of 
chemical warfare will not become an accepted part of regional 
conflicts 
walters spoke to reporters during a tour of asia to discuss 
issues to be considered at the 43rd session of the un general 
assembly which convenes sept 20 in new york 
in london the british foreign office said it wants an 
investigation partly because of state department evidence of 
chemical attacks 
the foreign office said it also based its decision on other 
evidence including reports from western journalists in turkey who 
have seen kurdish refugees they say are suffering from poison gas 
injuries 
however turkey said friday it found no evidence of the use of 
chemical weapons while examining sick and injured refugees 
in tunis tunisia the arab league said tuesday that charges of 
iraqs use of chemical weapons were fallacious 
in cairo egypt criticized the senate sanctions and a foreign 
ministry official said the accusations against iraq were groundless 
the un concluded in august following an investigation that 
chemical weapons continue to be used on an intensive scale 
against iranian forces 
in march iran claimed the iraqi air force dropped cyanide and 
mustard gas bombs on three kurdish towns in iraq killing 5000 
kurds and injuring 5000 the towns targeted by the attack had been 
captured by iran 
the 1925 geneva protocol bans the use of chemical or biological 
weapons although their manufacture and stockpiling is allowed to 
deter attack

proven reserves of us crude oil rose 
surprisingly last year mainly because oil companies upgraded their 
estimates of what alaskan fields can produce the energy department 
said tuesday 
the departments energy information administration said the 
revisions in estimates of existing reserves were the largest ithas 
ever recorded 
proven reserves amount to oil in the ground that has been 
measured and is considered producable with reasonable 
certainty with current prices and techniques many analysts liken 
the category to the ontheshelf inventory in a store 
since the amount recoverable depends on price with 
costlytoproduce formations being passed over when prices are low 
proven reserves will fluctuate even if additions to reserves just 
balance production 
as of dec 31 the department said us proven reserves were 
27256 billion barrels up 14 percent or 367 million barrels from 
26889 billion barrels recorded a year earlier 
proven natural gas reserves fell 23 percent from 1916 trillion 
cubic feet to 1872 trillion cubic feet continuing the trend of 
the past six years 
alaska crude oil reserves increased 503 million barrels with net 
upward revisions in estimates totaling 535 million barrels before 
discoveries other adjustments and production of 718 million 
barrels projects to recover oil normally left in the ground 
infill drilling to increase production from existing fields and 
better estimates of field performance all contributed to the 
increases the department said 
in the lower 48 states reserves decreased 07 percent or 136 
million barrels with net upward revisions in estimates of 1353 
billion barrels before discoveries other adjustments and 
production of 2155 billion barrels 
large gross upward revisions in reserves also were recorded in 
california 505 million barrels and in west texas 477 million 
barrels because of enhanced recovery efforts to produce oil 
from existing fields the department said 
overall alaska reserves increased 73 percent from 6875 billion 
barrels to 7378 billion barrels lower48 reserves decreased 07 
percent from 20014 billion barrels to 19878 billion barrels 
california reserves fell 05 percent from 4734 billion barrels to 
4709 billion barrels and texas reserves fell 06 percent from 
7152 billion barrels to 7112 billion barrels 
for the country as a whole discoveries added 691 million 
barrels to reserves in 1987 29 percent above the 534 million 
barrels added in 1986 but 22 percent below the 19771986 average 
a higher average price for the year 1541 per barrel vs 
1251 for 1986 enabled oil companies to count more oil in the 
proven category the department said 
prices are now falling said ed murphy of the american petroleum 
institute the principal trade group 
though the alaska gain was larger than he expected and the 
lower48 decline smaller he expected the downward trend in 
reserves over the last four to six years is apparent he said in 
only two years since 1980 when reserves were 29805 billion 
barrels have reserves increased 1984 and 1987 
the upward revisions from enhanced recovery projects are the 
result of substantial investments made in the late 1970s and the 
early 1980s which are just showing up 
such investments are now declining and the consequent lack of 
production and upward revision in reserve estimates will take a few 
years to become apparent murphy said

here are excerpts of the speech plo 
leader yasser arafat delivered in a closed session to some members 
of the european parliament the text of the speech was released by 
the parliaments socialist political group which invited arafat to 
speak 
i realize you have a lot of queries especially in the light of 
the historic steadfastness of the palestinian people as manifested 
by the uprising of its masses to end the occupation and wrest 
independence 
granted they are legitimate queries it is your right to get 
clear and specific answers to them from us outlining our overall 
line of thinking and action without necessarily going into 
specific details especially when they are sensitive the final 
decision on these rests with our own parliament the palestine 
national council 
the intefadeh arabic for uprising was an expression of the 
extent of our peoples alertness and their determination to resist 
the occupation by all means at their disposal exercising thereby 
their legal right under the un charter and resolutions 
today our people are confronting the iron fist policy and the 
israeli war machine with stones children and youths creating the 
image of a palestinian david pitted against a goliath armed to the 
teeth with the latest means of warfare and destruction 
we had hoped that the sight of children yielding stones to 
confront armored vehicles gunfire and suffocating gas would be 
sufficient to arouse the conscience of the israeli occupiers and to 
open their minds to the future realizing that recognition of the 
palestinian people and their right to selfdetermination and 
independence is the only road to peace away from the massacres 
and daily killings to which our men women and children are being 
subjected and in favor of a future built on peace and justice for 
all 
i hereby declare that the people of the intefadeh the 
palestinian people whom i represent are committed to peace based 
on justice our heritage and culture and our islam christianity 
and judaism disallow hatred and repudiate aggression inasmuch as 
they open our minds to peace based on justice they shape our 
resolve to defend ourselves uphold our rights and resist the 
occupation 
we respect our international commitments we also respect 
international legitimacy at the same time we believe that a just 
peace cannot be achieved through the selective application of half 
what international legitimacy provided for and the dumping of the 
other half 
that is why it is imperative that we witness and sense the 
respect by israel and the us administration of international 
resolutions particularly those upholding the palestinian peoples 
right to selfdetermination and statehood and which constitute the 
cornerstone of the proposed international peace conference 
it would be possible at the said conference and through the 
negotiations which will take place within its framework to discuss 
and agree on arrangements for international guarantees of peace 
among all states of the region including the independent 
palestinian state 
we endorse the charter of the united nations organization and 
all its resolutions including 242 and 338 international 
legitimacy is an indivisible whole and no one can choose to accept 
only what suits him and discard what does not 
consequently we declare our acceptance of one of the two 
following options as the basis for convening the international 
conference under un auspices and with the participation of the 
security council permanent members and all parties to the conflict 
in the region including the plo and israel 
a all un resolutions relevant to the palestine question 
including security council resolutions 242 and 338 
b resolutions 242 and 338 along with the legitimate rights of 
the palestinian people foremost among which is their right to 
selfdetermination 
in order to create an atmosphere of good will conducive to a 
just peace we responded positively and still do to all 
proposals calling for the withdrawal of the israeli occupation 
forces from the palestinian territories occupied in 1967 and 
placing these under un administration or an internationally 
supervised european force for a limited interim period the 
proposed international force could stay on after the establishment 
of the independent palestinian state for as long as the security 
council deems necessary to guarantee the security of everyone 
concerned 
we all know of the measures recently adopted by jordan 
concerning the west bank 
the plo central council accepted these measures and decided to 
shoulder the responsibilities resulting therefrom including the 
political among them regardless of the timing and the manner in 
which the measures were introduced without consultation or 
coordination with us and irrespective of the difficulties which 
we found ourselves facing 
the jordanian measures ended the european american and israeli 
debate on palestinian representation and the international 
conference 
no one can claim anymore that there is someone else to share 
with the plo the representation of the palestinian people 
particularly after the cessation of the jordanian option and the 
failure of the autonomy option the only option left is the right 
realistic and irreplaceable one namely the palestinian option 
the essence of which is the independent palestinian state 
we are working to set up an independent palestinian state on the 
land liberated from israeli occupation this state will have a 
republican democratic and multiparty system it will abide by the 
universal declaration of human rights and will not discriminate 
among its citizens on the basis of color race or religion 
we are at a crucial stage the palestinian state the key to 
peace security and development in the arab regionis in the 
offing

iraq stalled since they started almost three weeks ago went into 
recess tuesday and will move temporarily to new york 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar hopes to unblock the 
negotiations at un headquarters there 
un mediator jan eliasson of sweden said both sides accepted an 
invitation by perez de cuellar to continue direct talks soon at 
un headquarters he said they agreed to return to geneva for 
subsequent meetings 
eliasson has been presiding over the talks since last week as 
the un chiefs personal representative he said perez de cuellar 
invited foreign ministers ali akbar velayati of iran and tariq aziz 
of iraq to meet in new york on sept 22 but the iraqi delegation 
said in a statement issued tuesday night that aziz could not be in 
new york before the first week of october 
the statement indicated that acceptance of one meeting in 
new york was conditional on agreeing on a binding date for 
reconvening the talks in geneva 
eliasson told a news conference earlier tuesday that both iran 
and iraq seem committed to keep the peace process going and 
both confirmed that they will continue to observe the ceasefire 
the truce went into effect aug 20 after nearly eight years of 
fighting and about 1 million dead or wounded 
the talks in geneva began on aug 25 
eliasson conceded that on issues of substance there has been 
little if any progress but said the most important thing at this 
stage was that the peace process is kept alive 
the talks bogged down over differing priorities iran wants them 
to stick to implementation of un ceasefire resolution 598 
starting with withdrawal of all forces to the internationally 
recognized boundaries without delay iraq wants the negotiations 
to focus first on clearing the shattelarab waterway its main 
link to the sea and on freedom of negotiation in the persian gulf

president reagan got a grim report on the 
status of the nations forest fires on tuesday and was told there 
is no way to predict when the blazes will be tamed 
we are fighting with everything at hand white house 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the spokesman met with reporters after reagan was briefed on the 
forest fire situation by interior secretary donald hodel 
agriculture secretary richard lyng and deputy defense secretary 
william h taft at the white house 
fitzwater described their session with reagan as an update 
and said there were no new efforts to be announced following the 
session 
no one could give a prognosis of when the fires would be put 
out but it is clear that we have dedicated all of the resources 
available and all of our energies and the goal is the same for 
everyone and that is put those fires out fitzwater said 
the meeting came as thousands of firefighters continued to 
battle blazes in eight states particularly california montana 
colorado idaho utah oregon and washington state 
it also followed harsh words on the governments letburn 
approach to the fires from a usually strong reagan administration 
supporter sen orrin hatch rutah who called the situation a 
catastrophe 
fitzwater asked if the president had been given a worstcase 
scenario of the devastation in the briefing shot back we are 
in the worst case 
he did note later however that some of the officials had 
expressed some cautious optimism about prospects for calming 
the fires 
hodel lyng and taft had traveled west to review the situation 
over the weekend 
the president has been assured that we have been doing 
everything possible fitzwater said 
he noted that some 30000 firefighters were involved in battling 
32 fires in eight western states with approximately 4 million 
acres burned 
with the most recently dispatched military personnel on station 
by midweek fitzwater said some 2300 soldiers and 22 aircraft 
had been sent to yellowstone national park alone to battle the 
fires 
the president has repeatedly expressed his concern for the 
people living in the fire areas for the welfare of their families 
for their businesses and occupations and for the hardship that has 
undoubtedly consumed their lives fitzwater said 
he called the situation a natural disaster of unprecendented 
proportions and said the people in the area and government 
officials have responded with great selflessness and 
determination to get the situation under control 
we will continue to work tirelessly to put out these fires 
fitzwater pledged 
earlier in the day reagan had said hed not been aware of a 
us park service policy permitting some forest lands to burn and 
said that the policy has been scrapped 
asked what he thought of the socalled letburn policy that 
has been carried out by the interior department in recent years 
reagan told reporters i have questioned it i did not even know 
it existed frankly 
answering questions as he headed back into the oval office after 
signing the fair housing bill reagan said that when hodel arrived 
in wyoming last weekend he made it plain that we were 
withdrawing from this policy 
asked how the administration planned to deal with any new 
outbreaks of fires fitzwater said the let burn policy had been 
dropped in july and that all new fires would be put out 
the spokesman refused to entertain any discussion of the 
criticism of the administrations controversial policy but he 
noted that since the nation has never faced such an outbreak of 
fires before the time certainly calls for some review of the 
policy 
its not a clear case of whats right and whats wrong he 
said at this point whats clear is that the fires are out of 
control we have extraordinary drought conditions and there is 
no need to argue over policy differences until we come up with the 
next firefighting season next year right now its allout 
fightthefires 
the governments letburn policy has been harshly criticized by 
house and senate members from the western states 
hatch speaking to reporters after visiting the white house 
said we all knew how dry it was and a lot of us were saying 
hey dont let this burn and they could have contained it at that 
time 
some 8000 firefighters have worked in past days to dampen fires 
in yellowstone national park where the historic fires have charred 
939270 acres of the 22 millionacre park since june 
referring to the damage done to yellowstone hatch went on 
now you have a million acres lost in one of the most important 
national park areas in the world its a catastrophe 
without explanation the senator added i suspect it comes from 
just too much extremism in the environmental area and a lot of our 
people in the west are very disappointed very disenchanted about 
it 
house republican leader robert michel emerging from a meeting 
of gop congressional leaders with the president earlier also said 
that he had not been aware of the policy this letburn policy 
obviously is going to come under review michel said

the hasty departure of seven advisers to 
george bush with alleged ties to antisemitic activities 
underscores how firmly james a baker iii has taken charge of the 
republican nominees campaign according to top aides 
jim baker is a guy who likes to get things resolved said a 
senior campaign official who spoke only on condition that he not be 
identified 
a top bush adviser said the campaign was totally blindsided 
by the allegations of antisemitic activities which surfaced last 
wednesday as the vice president prepared to address a national 
bnai brith convention in baltimore 
circulated at that convention were copies of an article in 
washington jewish week which raised questions about members of the 
the campaigns ethnic coalition baker met with bush that evening 
and discussed the smoldering controversy aides said 
tension built over the weekend with a report in the washington 
post that frederic v malek a senior bush operative on the 
republican national committee had collected information on jewish 
officials in the bureau of labor statistics for president nixon in 
1971 
malek resigned the same day saying he was quitting for the sake 
of the bush campaign he acknowledged collecting the data but 
denied he had anything to do with the jewish officials later 
demotions 
campaign sources said six members of bushs coalition for 
american nationalities who resigned had been approached by campaign 
officials and told of bakers resolve to take firm and decisive 
action 
the situation was spelled out to those involved said one top 
official and they were asked what do you folks want to do 
these individuals came to this conclusion to resign on their 
own anyway the official said 
five of the ethnic officials resigned monday the bush campaign 
announced the sixth resignation on tuesday when radi slavoff quit 
as national cochairman of bulgarians for bush 
it was accepted i think were over it now said bush 
spokesman mark goodin 
slavoffs resignation followed a story in the philadelphia 
inquirer that identified him as former chief of a bulgarian group 
formed after world war ii which consisted of members of the 
nazialigned bulgarian legion 
the other five resigned after published reports linked them to 
antijewish or fascist activities 
bush campaign sources said they had no plans to replace malek as 
deputy republican national chairman 
the resignation of malek and the six ethnic advisers occurred 
with a lightning speed that would have been impossible before 
baker the former treasury secretary and white house chief of 
staff took command of the bush campaign aides said 
even though bush vigorously denied that any of the departing 
officials were antisemitic the resignations were viewed as a way 
to distance the vice president quickly from a potentially explosive 
campaign issue 
those who resigned said they were leaving to avoid any political 
embarrassment to bush not because there was any substance to the 
allegations of antisemitism 
bush speaking tuesday aboard air force two expressed 
irritation at the allegations saying we are going through an 
interesting period here without hard evidence on various things i 
dont like the allegations about people and i dont like it being 
injected into the campaign 
bush refused to say whether malek would be given a position in a 
bush administration but said he had a lot of confidence in 
malek 
president reagan declared tuesday that there isnt one iota of 
discrimination among members of the coalition created to court 
ethnic votes 
reagan told reporters at the white house he believed the ethnic 
advisers resigned because they didnt want to harm the campaign 
before bakers arrival the bush campaign was managed by a 
committee of six advisers and marked by frequent squabbles between 
bushs campaign officials and his vice presidential office 
aides said baker quickly established new lines of authority 
craig fuller bushs chief of staff and lee atwater the 
campaign manager had shared overlapping responsibility for bushs 
overall campaign activities in the past 
under bakers reorganization fuller is responsible only for 
scheduling and atwater for political activities the sources said

the rev jeanbertrand aristide is 
a hero to the poor and hated by the government a target of both 
adulation and assassination for his outspoken criticism of haitis 
military regime 
the roman catholic priest was saying morning mass last sunday 
when 20 to 30 thugs armed with knives machetes and guns burst into 
the st jean bosco church in portauprince and randomly 
slaughtered worshipers 
six people were confirmed dead and 77 wounded witnesses and 
hospital officials said 
despite the carnage witnesses said parishioners surrounded the 
priest and protected him with their bodies sweeping him to safety 
and into hiding aristide is perhaps the most popular figure among 
haitis slumdwelling masses 
during his sermons in which he vigorously denounced army terror 
and atrocities his small cementblock church in the la saline 
slum was regularly packed with exuberant sometimes hysterical 
supporters he has often led them into the streets for 
demonstrations during periods of unrest 
satan is eating us everywhere aristide said of the army 
during a wave of antigovernment demonstrations and harsh 
repression in june and july of 1987 they the army are the 
savages those who load their guns and shoot our children 
since the riots that summer gunmen in speeding cars have 
frequently sprayed gunfire at the wall of his churchs compound and 
the homes of other salesian priests close to aristide 
on aug 23 1987 aristide and four other priests were ambushed 
near st marc on the main northsouth highway 60 miles north of the 
capital portauprince 
as they returned from a mass in memory of a recent peasant 
massacre about 40 men armed with machine guns stones and clubs 
attacked their car injuring two of the priests soldiers at a 
checkpoint 70 yards away did not intervene 
aristide escaped and went into hiding for several weeks 
following the incident 
during a sunday mass on sept 4 a man entered aristides church 
with a gun stuck in his belt the man fled after parishioners 
wrestled him to the ground and seized the pistol 
aristides name and those of other opposition leaders are on a 
death list of people marked for assassination which has 
circulated in portauprince 
aristide who preaches that marxism and christianity are 
compatible has not actually called for an armed uprising but 
repeatedly advocated the overthrow of the lt gen henri namphys 
military government by active nonviolent struggle 
the conservative hierarchy of the church has rejected aristides 
notion of class struggle in april the church leadership 
apparently attempted to rob aristide of his power base the 
capitals slums by transferring him to a remote rural parish 
north of portauprince 
for several days a dozen of his youthful followers occupied the 
notre dame cathedral in the capital and went on a hunger strike 
which forced the bishops to rescind their order 
aristide in his mid30s was ordained by his uncle bishop 
willie romelus of the western town of jeremie who is the only 
openly antimilitary member of haitis 10member bishops conference 
although the bishops have never called for the overthrow of 
namphys government they issued a statement last month that echoed 
one made by pope john paul ii during a tour of haiti in 1983 which 
said things must change in the impoverished nation 
the statement protested the expulsion of a priest the 
assassination of human rights leader lafontant joseph in july and 
accused the military government of authoritarian rule and disregard 
for human life 
pope johns visit helped crystalize public repudiation of the 
dictatorship of jeanclaude duvalier who fled to exile in france 
on feb 7 1986

two national polls tuesday found george bush 
pulling past michael dukakis in the presidential race and they 
indicated that bush has scored points by pressing the pledge of 
allegiance as an issue 
bush led by eight points in both national surveys 4739 percent 
in a cbs newsnew york times poll and 4941 percent in a gallup 
poll the gallup poll found dukakis suffering his highest negative 
rating of the race 
two polls released monday showed a closer race but two surveys 
last week found bush leading by six and eight points respectively 
moreover the new polls found support for bush on underlying issues 
he has been pressing 
on defense 28 percent of the probable voters in the cbstimes 
poll said bush would make the nation stronger and only 4 percent 
said he would make it weaker by contrast 39 percent said dukakis 
would make us defenses weaker and just 13 percent said he would 
make the nation stronger the rest in both cases said defenses 
would remain unchanged 
in another measure gallup found that 68 percent of the 
registered voters it interviewed had heard of the pledge of 
allegiance issue and by a 21 margin they had a less favorable 
view of dukakis because of it 
bush in what has become a repeated refrain has criticized 
dukakis for vetoing legislation in massachusetts requiring teachers 
to lead classes in the pledge dukakis said he acted on the basis 
of a court opinion that the law was unconstitutional and he 
accused bush of impugning his patriotism 
but 70 percent in the cbstimes poll said teachers should be 
required to lead pupils in the pledge and half of that group said 
it should be mandated even if the courts ruled the requirement 
unconstitutional 
bush also has been stressing environmental issues traditionally 
a strong suit for democrats and the cbstimes poll found him 
ranked nearly evenly with dukakis on protecting the environment 
the cbstimes poll even found backing for bush on an issue 
dukakis had sought to make his own competence fiftyone percent 
said bush would be more competent at managing the federal 
government to 32 percent for dukakis 
overall the gallup survey found 40 percent expressing an 
unfavorable view of dukakis up from 32 percent three weeks ago and 
the highest all year for dukakis in gallups poll dukakis was 
rated favorably by more voters 53 percent but bush bettered him 
in both ratings with 59 percent favorable and 35 percent 
unfavorable 
dukakis confidence rating suffered in the cbstimes poll but 
in that measure bushs score worsened as well fiftynine percent 
said they would be uneasy with dukakis in an international crisis 
up from 53 percent just after the republican convention last month 
fewer 47 percent said they would be uneasy with bush in a 
crisis but that was up 10 points from the postconvention poll 
also 45 percent said they would be confident with bush down from 
51 percent for dukakis 28 percent expressed confidence little 
changed from 29 percent 
dukakis continued to lead bush on one other key issue 
fortyseven percent said the democrat would do more to help the 
middle class while 33 percent picked bush 
finally bush encountered a low rating on his choice of sen dan 
quayle of indiana as his running mate fiftyeight percent said 
they would be worried about quayle stepping in as president if 
something happened to bush and just 32 percent said quayle was 
qualified to serve as president 
the cbstimes poll was conducted among 1043 probably voters 
from thursday through sunday and had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points the gallup poll was done friday through 
sunday among 1003 registered voters and was given a fourpoint 
margin of error

a highranking official said tuesday that 
iraq is moving many kurds from small villages for security or 
better services but insisted it is not trying to wipe them out or 
change their style of life 
kurdish rebel groups and others have denounced iraqs policy of 
demolishing small villages and relocating their population the 
us senate suggested on friday such acts were connected with 
genocide against the kurdish people 
but the official nizar hamdoon deputy foreign secretary and 
former iraqi ambassador to the united states said in an interview 
that the government has no intention to change the life of the 
kurds 
asked about reports of widespread relocations he said if 
youre talking about the border area the reasons are mainly 
security reasons so that rebel infiltration stops 
with development its more feasible to bring people 
together to provide better services 
hamdoon said some of the kurdish rebels who were offered amnesty 
after fleeing to turkey would be relocated if they return 
obviously for security reasons we have to relocate some of 
them but they will be provided with a place within kurdistan 
he said refering to the remote northern region of iraq where kurds 
live 
following a round of fighting that ended in 1975 iraq 
demolished a string of villages along its border with iran and 
moved their people 
over the last year baghdadbased diplomats said the iraqi army 
demolished scores of other small villages in the mountainous 
kurdish territories and moved the people into towns or new concrete 
apartment blocks along main roads 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
intention seemed to be to keep closer watch on the kurds and rob 
the rebels of village sanctuaries in the rugged mountains 
iraq grants its 25 million to 3 million kurdish inhabitants a 
form of regional autonomy including their own assembly and use of 
the kurdish language 
rebel groups demand wider autonomy or creation of an independent 
state an additional 6 million kurds live in turkey iran the 
soviet union and syria 
hamdoon noted that none of those countries granted the kurds any 
form of autonomy 
he said the policy of moving iraqis from remote villages to 
larger towns is not limited to kurdistan 
he said similar moves had also taken place in the marshy misan 
province in the south the kut region south of baghdad and the 
western deserts 
observers who visited eastern kurdistan said they saw only a few 
small villages still standing along the main roads and many old 
ones bulldozed 
but an associated press reporter who recently visited the 
northern town of amadiya 12 miles from the turkish border said 
relatively few destroyed villages were visible and several small 
ones still were standing and populated 
in new york un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
conveyed to iraqs charge daffaires ali mahmoud sumaida on 
tuesday a request from 10 nations including america that iraq let 
chemical weapons experts go there to investigate claims that iraq 
used poison gas to crush the kurdish uprising 
iraq denies using gas against the kurds but previously 
acknowledged using chemical weapons against iran in their 
8yearold war 
an iraqi official said in baghdad that iraq probably would not 
admit such a proposed un team as a matter of sovereignty

seventyfive days after he set sail and 
44 days after he was reported missing at sea donovan jones 
returned to dry land tuesday with new respect for canned food and 
the coast guard 
the 58yearold eugene ore man had planned to sail his 
32foot wooden sloop from marina del rey in southern california to 
oahu hawaii he left in late june expecting to arrive by late july 
im not an old salt or anything like that but im not a 
novice he said 
on july 31 his family reported him missing 
im married but i did tell my wife before i left not to call 
the coast guard i told her it takes a long time to get anywhere 
he said during a telephone interview with the associated press 
minutes after he reached land here in northern california 
i havent called her yet 
jones plans went astray shortly after he left he headed south 
then turned west at 16 degrees north latitude to swing over toward 
hawaii 
and then a storm came along and blew me south and to the west 
of hawaii he said 
because of prevailing wind patterns i couldnt come back 
northeast to hawaii against the wind so i decided to come back 
to the mainland 
with his radio batteries dead he slowly worked his way through 
a small stock of canned food and vitamins he dragged a line in 
hopes of catching fish but i guess im not much of a fisherman 
he hadnt had a chance to weigh himself yet but guessed he lost 
20 to 25 pounds 
early sunday when he was just 100 miles off eureka a large 
storm came up and ripped away his hatch cover 
everything was in a shambles inside and i was having a hard 
time keeping the water out jones said then another sailboat 
came along and called the coast guard on its radio 
a coast guard helicopter flew out a portable generator to power 
jones radio and some rations then a coast guard boat towed him 
into humboldt bay 
the coast guard was really wonderful and i cant say enough 
about them said jones 
he isnt ready to give up sailing just because of one 
misadventure 
i love the sea and this hasnt changed me so far as i want to 
give it up he said i feel healthier since ive sailed life 
in the city isnt good for you

here are some comments tuesday from the 
presidential campaign trail 
 
michael dukakis underscoring his theme that dan quayle is not 
up to dealing forcefully with the soviet union and noting that 
three vice presidents since 1945 later had to deal with the soviets 
as president dan quayle is no gerald ford hes no lyndon 
johnson and he sure aint harry truman can we stake our future on 
the hope that he is a match for mikhail gorbachev 
 
dan quayle in a zinger aimed at dukakis foreign policy

michael dukakis questioned on tuesday how george bush would be 
able to deal with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev if he couldnt 
stand up to the ayatollah or say no to noriega the vice 
president preached the gospel of republican prosperity and said 
america is a rising nation again 
gop vice presidential candidate dan quayle got off the snappiest 
oneliner of the day when he announced to a milwaukee audience that 
dukakis had lost his top naval adviser his rubber duck drowned 
in his bathtub quayle said in another in a series of comments 
designed to undercut the democratic candidates foreign policy and 
defense credentials 
bush campaigned as two new national polls found bush pulling 
ahead of dukakis by eight points bush led by 47 percent to 39 
percent in a cbs newsnew york times poll and 49 percent to 41 
percent in a gallup poll 
gallup found results from bushs attacks on dukakis for vetoing 
a massachusetts law requiring teachers to lead students in the 
pledge of allegiance the poll said 68 percent of the registered 
voters it interviewed had heard of the pledge of allegiance issue 
and by a 21 margin they had a less favorable view of dukakis 
because of it 
the republican campaign was buffeted with more controversy when 
the cochairman of bulgarians for bush resigned after being 
identified in a newspaper report as the former head of a 
nazialigned group formed in bulgaria after world war ii radi 
slavoff became the sixth person to resign from bush ethnic 
organizations over allegations of antisemitic activities 
top republican national committee official frederic v malek 
also resigned sunday after it was reported that he had conducted a 
survey under orders from thenpresident nixon of top bureau of 
labor statistics officials to see how many of them were jewish 
bush expressed irritation at what he called the lack of hard 
evidence on various things although he refused to say whether he 
would hire malek in a bush administration the vice president 
expressed confidence in him 
president reagan in remarks before slavoffs departure had been 
announced said he was sure the vice presidents campaign hadnt 
suffered from any appearance of antisemitism he added he was 
certain because i know bush and i know the people involved and 
there isnt an iota of discrimination in any of them 
dukakis spokesman leslie dach said bushs policy on questions of 
bigotry is to ignore the shame and blame the opposition 
the new polls came on the heels of two surveys providing 
snapshots of a close presidential race with eight weeks remaining 
one survey indicated bush was leading but by less than the polls 
margin of error the other indicated dukakis led but also by less 
than the margin of potential error 
the image was thus of a race still forming with the outcome 
likely to be heavily influenced by two presidential debates in late 
september and midoctober as well as by an early october 
confrontation between quayle and democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen 
nbc executives said tuesday the network has reversed its 
decision and will carry the first presidential debate live on sept 
25 interrupting primetime coverage of the summer olympics the 
other major networks said earlier they would cover the debate as it 
occurred 
both bush and dukakis made their way through large battleground 
states during the day 
dukakis hoping to bolster his standing as a candidate 
knowledgable about foreign policy offered his view of ussoviet 
relations criticizing bush and quayle and invoking the optimistic 
rhetoric of john f kennedy 
civility is not a sign of weakness and sincerity is always 
subject to proof he quoted the last president from 
massachusetts dukakis said he would challenge gorbachev to reach 
additional arms control accords and to open the eastern bloc to 
more freedom 
he said republicans are content to leave the intiative on arms 
control and regional disputes and the spread of advanced weapons 
systems around the world to mr gorbachev we are not 
george bush has been around washington for a long time but if 
he couldnt stand up to the ayatollah or say no to noriega how 
will he measure up to gorbachev dukakis said in a speech to the 
chicago council on foreign relations 
that was a reference to the irancontra armsforhostages affair 
and us government dealings with panamanian leader manuel antonio 
noriega who is under indictment on drug charges 
dukakis later went to a tank factory in sterling heights mich 
where he donned a helmet and rode in an m1 abrams tank for the 
benefit of television cameras he recalled bushs statement last 
year that soviet tank workers would be useful in detroit and he 
said mr bush id rather have mechanics from michigan 
as for quayle dukakis noted that since world war ii three vice 
presidents have moved into the oval office without being elected 
president 
dan quayle is no gerald ford hes no lyndon johnson and he 
sure aint harry truman the democratic presidential candidate 
said 
bush countered on his running mates behalf isnt it 
interesting that the top of the ticket has to be shooting at the 
vice presidential nominee now 
bush made his way from illinois to missouri to california during 
the day states accounting for 82 electoral votes of the 270 
needed for victory as he stressed the economic recovery of the 
reagan era 
scorning dukakis as the governor from taxachusetts bush 
depicted dukakis and the democrats as prophets of pessimism he 
told the executives club of chicago americans at every income 
level are certifiably better off than they were in 1981 so the 
next time somebody tells you that america is declining tell em to 
put away the 1980 calendar this is 1988 america is a rising 
nation again 
the cbstimes poll was conducted among 1043 probably voters 
from thursday through sunday and had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 3 percentage points the gallup poll was done friday through 
sunday among 1003 registered voters and was given a fourpoint 
margin of error

the house ethics committee is seeking another 
550000 to pay the outside counsel hired by the panel in july to 
investigate allegations against house speaker jim wright 
the committees contract with the special counsel chicago 
attorney richard j phelan provides that he will be paid not more 
than 300000 plus expenses 
but rep julian dixon dcalif chairman of the committee said 
monday that based on costs for professional services provided by 
phelans law firm through aug 31 the committee will exceed the 
300000 limit before congress adjourns next month 
in a letter to rep frank annunzio chairman of the house 
administration committee dixon said the extra 550000 will ensure 
that there will not be any financial impediment to the efficient 
completion of the preliminary inquiry into the allegations 
against wright 
dixon said he was prohibited by house rules from disclosing 
the status progress or projected completion date of the wright 
investigation but he said phelans law firm has six attorneys 
working on the case full time and other attorneys working part 
time all of whom are compensated at an hourly rate of 125 
the ethics committee formally known as the committee on 
standards of official conduct initially received a 400000 
appropriation for fiscal 1988 after the panel hired phelan to 
conduct the wright investigation the house approved an additional 
350000 for the panel 
the committee acting on a complaint filed by rep newt 
gingrich rga voted in june to launch an investigation into six 
allegations against wright including charges that he used his 
office improperly to lobby federal officials and others on matters 
in which he had a financial interest 
the investigation also is focusing on alleged improprieties in 
the publication of a book by a campaign contractor for which wright 
received unusually high royalties 
wright has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that he will 
be cleared by the investigation

christian militiamen kidnapped the 
defense minister tuesday but freed him three hours later under 
pressure from the army the incident worsened a political crisis 
that could reignite lebanons civil war 
police said the kidnappers members of the lebanese forces 
militia released adel osseiran 83 at 240 pm after the army 
command threatened to storm an apartment building in which he was 
being held in east beirut 
a police spokesman said moslem and christian militiamen traded 
automatic rifle fire and rocketpropelled grenades across beiruts 
dividing green line after the shiite moslem ministers abduction 
the spokesman who cannot be identified in line with standing 
regulations said at least two gunmen were killed and two wounded 
in the fighting which he described as a localized incident 
he said the commander of the lebanese forces samir geagea 
received osseiran after his release and apologized to him for the 
behavior of the unruly militiamen 
we denounce such acts in our areas especially when they 
target a personality like osseiran who is one of heroes of 
lebanons independence geagea said in a statement broadcast by 
radio stations in east beirut 
the silverhaired osseiran drove from east beirut to the alumni 
club of the american university of beirut in the citys moslem 
sector for lunch after his release 
the minister wearing a dark gray suit told reporters his 
captors took him to a ninthfloor apartment in east beiruts 
ashrafiyeh district 
they prepared coffee for me he said as a matter of fact 
i can say that i enjoyed meeting these people 
osseiran said in english that the kidnappers were members of the 
lebanese forces from the christian town of jezzine in south lebanon 
the kidnappers had offered to trade osseiran for a christian 
parliament deputy farid serhal who they claimed was kidnapped 
thursday in west beirut 
police said gunmen seized osseiran in east beirut at a 
checkpoint near the green line manned by the lebanese forces and 
took him to their headquarters 
an hour later army commander gen michel aoun a christian 
ordered his 42000 troops on alert and warned the kidnappers to 
release osseiran at once 
aoun has long been at odds with the lebanese forces over their 
growing dominance of east beirut and the christian heartland north 
of the capital that has eroded the authority of lebanons divided 
government 
the lebanese forces claim serhal a maronite catholic was 
kidnapped by prosyrian militiamen of druse warlord walid 
jumblatts progressive socialist party at a checkpoint south of 
beirut as he drove to jezzine they said serhal was being kept at 
west beiruts bristol hotel against his will 
osseirans abduction heightened tension between moslems and 
christians during a political deadlock in efforts to elect a new 
president 
moslem factions and christians have been fighting a civil war in 
lebanon for 13 years ravaging the economy and leaving more than 
130000 dead syria is the main power broker maintaining 40000 
troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south

president reagan has authorized the release of 
188 million in us dues payments to the united nations and has 
directed the state department to work on a plan for settling all 
past debts the white house announced tuesday 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters in a late 
afternoon briefing that reagan told the state department to work 
out a multiyear plan for paying a grand total of 520 million 
in current and late us dues payments to the world body the us 
also has 1118 million in past due payments separately to the un 
peacekeeping fund 
fitzwater said the united nations has reformed its operations 
to the point where reagan felt he could act 
the president will release 44 million which was withheld in 
fiscal 1988 and 144 million which was withheld in fiscal 1989 he 
will request full funding of the united nations in fiscal 1990 
which amounts to approximately 476 million he said 
the 44 million will be released immediately fitzwater said 
while the 144 million that had been earmarked in fiscal 1989 
beginning oct 1 will be set free as funds become available 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told reporters as 
he left un headquarters in new york that reagans decision is a 
very positive development which i very much welcome and which 
alleviates our difficulties of course it is not the end of our 
financial problems but it will alleviate them very much 
in an earlier statement written on his behalf perez de cuellar 
said until the outstanding contributions by all member states 
are paid the organization will continue to operate with inadequate 
current income and virtually without reserves 
fitzwater noted that congress required the president to 
determine that the united nations had made reforms including 
cutbacks in the un secretariat the hiring of temporary 
employees and improved budgeting procedures 
fitzwater said reagan was convinced that the united nations had 
made progress in instituting reforms and that the president noted 
the increasing peacekeeping role of the world body in such hot 
spots as afghanistan namibia and the persian gulf 
the united nations he said is serving important longterm 
interests of the united states in these troubled regions 
fitzwater said reagans decision to release a portion of the 
funds owed the united nations immediately makes clear that the 
united states is ready to meet its obligations 
on capitol hill sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee said president reagans 
actions breathe new life into our hopes for world peace by 
enabling the un to fund peacekeeping operations 
i do however deeply regret that this administration has 
found it necessary to wait to act until the united nations is near 
the brink of financial disaster and us credibility has been 
severely damaged pell told the senate 
rep jim leach riowa a house foreign affairs committee member 
who has urged increased us leadership on un issues said the 
reagan decision appears to signal a new era of cooperation rather 
than confrontation with the united nations the only question is 
whether congress has the vision and the fortitude to reverse course 
and follow the presidents lead 
the united states regular un dues assessment amounts to a 
quarter of the money in the bodys budget and the united states 
also is assessed 31 percent of the peacekeeping costs 
we have seen in the last six months some important reforms in 
terms of the budget and hiring practices and so forth and so that 
has been a determining factor fitzwater said he also credited 
the united nations with being an important factor in getting 
soviet troops to withdraw from afghanistan and he said there had 
been an improvement in the political environment in the world body 
where american interests are concerned 
reagan is scheduled to visit the united nations for two days 
later this month and will address the general assembly on sept 
26 he also will meet with a number of foreign leaders while in new 
york 
during the seven and a half years of this administration the 
president has sought to change the political environment 
fitzwater said 
although the reform is incomplete the progress is striking 
he said saying the united states had been demanding more 
accountability from the united nations for the money it spends 
the aim he said was to prod the united nations to become an 
even greater force for peace throughout the world 
in announcing these decisions the president called on the 
united nations to continue progress in areas where reform remains 
incomplete the spokesman said the president reiterated the 
commitment of the us to assist the un in its reform program as 
well as in its new peacekeeping efforts 
vernon walters the us ambassador to the united nations had 
said in late july that the united states hoped to pay 188 million 
of its debt to the united ations before the year was out to help 
prevent the world body from running out of money at a time of 
heightened peacekeeping activities 
testifying july 29 before the senate foreign relations 
committee walters said that if progress were reached at resolving 
such world problems as soviet occupation of afghanistan the cuban 
presence in angola a transition to independence for namibia and 
the vietnamese occupation of cambodia the un could face an 
annual peacekeeping bill of more than 15 billion 
all of these are important to the interests of the united 
states and all are likely to involve the united nations 
significantly he said at the time this increase in activity 
takes place at a time when the un is facing a very tight cash 
situation

dealing with his first major hurricane 
as director of the national hurricane center bob sheets wasnt 
skipping a beat tuesday as a multitude of reporters fired questions 
at him 
sheets who was acting director during the 1987 atlantic 
hurricane season and was named director in march spent most of the 
morning on the sixth floor of hurricane headquarters beside a large 
monitor showing the destructive hurricane gilbert sprawled across 
much of the western caribbean 
his schedule of interviews was timed to the minute but sheets 
rosycheeked and goodnatured didnt so much as flinch in his seat 
after all he noted ive flown into 200 hurricanes i 
really dont think this is difficult 
the transition from former director neil frank widely known for 
his distinctive style and flattop haircut to sheets his dark 
blond hair carefully coiffed and wearing a bright pink shirt with a 
gray woolblend jacket has been a smooth one 
he knows his job very well and hes a calm personality 
vivian jorge the centers budget analyst said of sheets on days 
with active tropical weather ms jorge steps in to coordinate 
media interviews 
and interest in gilbert has been high since it started packing 
hurricaneforce winds over the weekend and by tuesday afternoon 
became a category 5 storm with winds of 160 mph and a central 
pressure of 2666 inches 
a category 5 hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale of strength 
has winds in excess of 155 mph and pressure less than 2717 inches 
and has the potential for causing catastrophic damage 
this would be considered a great hurricane said sheets 
its certainly in the top 10 percent as far as intensity size 
and destructive potential 
gilbert was being compared to the hurricane of 1935 which 
slammed into the florida keys and killed 600 people and hurricane 
camille which devastated the mississippi coast in 1969 killing 
256 those are the only category 5 storms which have made landfall 
this century 
the last major hurricane to make landfall was elena in 1985 
along the mississippi alabama and florida panhandle 
the major television networks local stations and newspapers 
media were on hand to monitor the hurricane which could reach the 
gulf of mexico by thursday said sheets from there its anybodys 
guess where it will go he said 
its a brand new ball game as far as the continental united 
states is concerned said sheets 
the centers 33member crew including seven hurricane 
forecasters and specialists are keeping a close watch of the 
hurricane in a large open room of blue monitors flickering with 
color and noncolor graphics 
and while sheets might appear to be spend most of his day with 
tiny microphones snaking down his back for tv interviews and 
fielding questions he also writes most of the hurricane advisories 
issued every three hours and makes hurricane forecasts 
dealing with a major hurricane isnt much different from dealing 
with smaller ones or tropical storms sheets said adding that 
gilbert has been particularly wellbehaved 
it does what we think its going to do you feel a lot more 
confident about what youre doing than with weaker systems he 
said

three prominent antiapartheid 
activists detained for more than a year without charge escaped 
from a hospital tuesday and took refuge at the us consulate in a 
highrise office building 
the us embassy said it had high regard for the men and 
would not force them to leave against their will 
two of the three are senior officials of the nowbanned united 
democratic front acting publicity secretary murphy morobe a 
black and acting general secretary mohammed valli moosa an 
indian the other is vusi khanyile a black who was chairman of the 
banned national education crisis committee 
the us embassy statement confirmed that the three had taken 
refuge at the consulate on the 11th floor of an office building in 
downtown johannesburg the building is two miles from the hospital 
where they were being treated 
the main us embassy is in pretoria 
several associates of the escapees later met with us 
ambassador edward perkins and they said he assured them the men 
would be well cared for 
the three have asked to meet with their relatives and with 
leaders of the antiapartheid movement but they have not disclosed 
any other requests 
we were in frequent contact with these three men prior to 
their detention without charge and hold them in high regard the 
us statement said we will not press them to leave against 
their will 
the statement said the united states does not offer asylum at 
its diplomatic offices but it said these premises are inviolable 
under international law and may not be entered by the host 
government without consent the embassy said it was discussing the 
situation with the activists and the south african government 
jay naidoo an antiapartheid labor leader said he and several 
colleagues including max coleman conferred with perkins americas 
first black ambassador to south africa and they were assured the 
escapees physical needs would be cared for coleman said of the 
three theyre very pleased to be where they are 
brig leon mellet a spokesman for the law and order ministry 
said the men had escaped from johannesburg hospital where they had 
been receiving physiotherapy no details of the escape were 
disclosed 
previously the three had been at johannesburgs diepkloof 
prison 
at the consulate there was no visible sign of security force 
deployments a private guard stood at the entrance while about two 
dozen journalists waited in the hall for several hours before 
dispersing 
morobe 32 and valli moosa 31 were detained in july 1987 
after going into hiding when a state of emergency was declared june 
12 1986 khanyile 37 was detained in december 1986 
between the emergency declaration and his detention morobe 
operated from underground wearing disguises and showing up 
unannounced at newspaper offices 
as one of the united democratic fronts most eloquent writers 
and speakers he played a key role in conveying the positions of 
the nations largest antiapartheid group at a time when most of 
its leaders were in jail or in hiding 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without charge at 
some point during the emergency the government has not released 
comprehensive statistics but it said recently that 802 people who 
had been held at least 30 days were still in custody 
many of the detainees were members of organizations affiliated 
to the united democratic front a nationwide coalition of more than 
600 antiapartheid groups 
also detained were virtually all top leaders of the national 
education crisis committee a coalition of parent teacher and 
student groups seeking to give blacks more control over curriculum 
and policies in their schools 
the committee was instrumental in calling off classroom boycotts 
that spread nationwide in 198586 but when it subsequently 
campaigned for peoples education the government outlawed it 
the united democratic front and the crisis committee were among 
17 antiapartheid organizations banned in february from conducting 
any activities the us government was among many to condemn these 
bannings 
twice in recent years activists have taken refuge at diplomatic 
missions in south africa six united democratic front leaders 
stayed at the british consulate in durban for several weeks in late 
1984 before emerging to face arrest for high treason the charges 
later were withdrawn 
in september 1987 south africa agreed to let a dutchman klaus 
de jonge return to the netherlands after being holed up at a dutch 
embassy office in pretoria for two years 
de jonge escaped into the office from police custody after being 
arrested for aiding the outlawed african national congress

the author of the 15yearold supreme 
court decision legalizing abortion in the case of roe vs wade 
warned tuesday that the 1988 term of the court could see the ruling 
overturned 
justice harry a blackmun who wrote the 1973 decision 
overturning restrictive antiabortion laws in texas indicated the 
decision could turn on how faithful new justice anthony kennedy is 
to the judicial doctrine of stare decisis a policy of courts 
not to disturb a settled point of law 
the next question is will roe vs wade go down the drain 
blackmun 79 told a class of firstyear law students at the 
university of arkansas at little rock i think theres a very 
distinct possibility that it will this term you can count the 
votes 
in an apparent reference to kennedy blackmun said one never 
knows what a new justices attitude toward stare decisis is its 
now 15 years old 
no abortion case is scheduled for argument before the court but 
there is speculation in the legal community that the court will 
look for one now that the panel includes three appointees of 
president reagan a noted opponent of abortions 
blackmun said his majority opinion in roe vs wade has been 
criticized from all points of the compass but he wouldnt change 
it much if he were to write it today he decided the case primarily 
on the basis of a womans constitutional right to decide what to do 
with her body 
blackmun went into no further detail on the possibility of the 
decision being overturned 
blackmun said the abortion issue which he has addressed in many 
decisions for the court since 1973 is a very controversial 
emotional distressful kind of litigation that has been politicized 
in the last few years 
he noted the picketing by antiabortionists around the country 
during the presidential campaign saying i respect their 
opinions i just wish they wouldnt make a single issue out of a 
political campaign but this too will pass away as mr dickens said 
a long time ago 
commenting on blackmuns remarks douglas johnson legislative 
director of the national right to life committee said it is 
highly improper for a supreme court justice to interject himself 
into a presidential campaign as justice blackmun did 
apparently justice blackmun himself is on the campaign trail 
trying to energize certain opinion elites to rally in defense of 
roe v wade johnson said from his washington apparently 
blackmun recognizes that roe v wade cannot survive merely on its 
constitutional merits so he is calling for cavalry support 
johnsons group claims 3000 chapters nationwide 
blackmun said his abortion opinion has generated more mail than 
any other court opinion 
i would say that probably i get a dozen letters a day some 
very abusive and others on the other side of the case are the 
most lovely letters i get blackmun said just as an example i 
got this cheery little mailgram recently from decatur illinois 
because you satanic supreme court justices stand against god 
against justice against victims against common sense against 
honesty and everything clean you will also stand before almighty 
god while your bloodsoaked hands drip with the blood of innocent 
victims you supreme court justices stink with moral rot 
heres one that i rather like he said it came out of 
iola kansas it has little stamps up here go union may i 
please have your autograph paragraph you are responsible for the 
deaths of more babies than anyone else in the history of the world 
and this is just the beginning of the slaughter of the helpless 
paragraph i would certainly appreciate your autograph if ever 
there was a schizophrenic letter 
well they come in he said of the letters there are some 
threatening materials of course and a good bit of it is 
organized and a lot of it is tunnel vision

democrat michael dukakis questioned on tuesday 
whether republican rival george bush is up to dealing with soviet 
leaders at a time when soviet economic difficulties offer great 
opportunities for the united states 
george bush has been around washington for a long time but if 
he couldnt stand up to the ayatollah or say no to panamanian 
gen manuel noriega how will he measure up to gorbachev 
dukakis said 
and if he truly believes that j danforth quayle is qualified 
to be one heartbeat away from the presidency how can we trust his 
judgment when americas future is on the line he said 
dukakis spoke to the chicago council on foreign relations in 
what campaign aides described as a major address outlining his view 
of ussoviet relations it was part of a week devoted largely to 
national security issues by the democratic presidential nominee 
who is trying to counter the republicans depiction of him as soft 
on defense 
dukakis intensified that effort later at a general dynamics tank 
facility in sterling heights mich where he donned a helmet and 
rode in a m1 abrams tank the militarys top battlefield tank and 
pledged to make strengthening conventional weapons among his top 
defense priorities 
dukakis stood through the hatch of the tank his hand resting on 
a 762 mm machine gun the tanks turret and cannon spinning as 
the tank was driven at high speed around a grassy field 
he said the reagan administration had tried to cut tank 
production by onequarter and asserted that bush would cut 
conventional military spending to finance the star wars nuclear 
defense program 
dukakis planned to address defense and weapons in a speech 
wednesday in washington aides scheduled a stop in yellowstone 
park to view fire damage on his way to california thursday 
in his chicago speech dukakis said the next president must 
seize the intiative in dealing with the soviets however he 
said bush has no strategy for testing the limits of what is 
called new thinking in the soviet union 
he said the soviet union under mikhail s gorbachev has an 
economy facing difficulty in providing for its people and that 
gorbachev wants access to western technology resources and trade 
mr gorbachev wants to make his country part of the 
international economic community dukakis said what is he 
prepared to do in return will we allow him to pursue that strategy 
unchallenged or will we have a strategy of our own to rotect 
american interests and translate soviet economic weakness into 
improved soviet behavior in world affairs 
dukakis said he would deal firmly with the soviets and said 
gorbachev is a leninist who has not abandoned soviet goals 
he said it would be naive to take gorbachev at his word but 
it would be dangerous to allow his words to go unanswered 
dukakis said he would challenge the soviets to reduce european 
troops cool regional conflicts end the spread of nuclear and 
chemical weapons and missiles reject terrorism and allow the 
emigration of jews and other minorities 
mr gorbachev must understand that if there is to be a 
fundamental change in the relationship of his country with the 
western world there must first be a fundamental change in the 
balance of forces in central europe dukakis said 
he said he wanted to build on the intermediaterange nuclear 
forces reduction agreement and would challenge gorbachev to 
eliminate a soviet advantage in tanks and artillery in europe 
not just by demobilizing those weapons but by destroying them 
he also said he would seek to have the soviets withdraw troops 
back into the ukraine 
dukakis hammered at his theme that sen quayle bushs running 
mate was not up to dealing forcefully with the soviets he noted 
that three vice presidents since 1945 have been propelled suddenly 
to the presidency and that all of them later met as president with 
soviet leaders 
dan quayle is no gerald ford dukakis said hes no lyndon 
johnson and he sure aint harry truman can we stake our future on 
the hope that he is a match for mikhail gorbachev 
dukakis wrapped up the day in washington where in a speech to 
the congressional hispanic caucus he said reagans appointment of a 
hispanic lauro f cavazos to secretary of education was too 
little too late 
for some people its enough to wake up after eight years and 
create opportunity for one hispanic he said i want to stand 
with you and create opportunity for 20 million hispanics

nato secretary general manfred woerner said on 
tuesday that western europeans will have to spend more for defense 
to avert a transatlantic slanging match between the united 
states and its allies 
woerner in his first public speech since taking over as top 
political official of the north atlantic treaty organization said 
he welcomed soviet reforms but doubted they would go far 
enough 
we must take account of realities more than intentions 
woerner told the atlantic council a private organization soviet 
defense programs have not slowed down 
but he added i see more opportunities than risks ahead 
the nato allies should challenge soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev to make more progress toward military stability in 
europe a global ban on chemical weapons greater observation of 
human rights and deeper economic and scientific cooperation 
the success of the west is the driving force behind the soviet 
leaderships reforms political as well as economic but it is 
doubtful that they go far enough to overcome the structural 
failings of the soviet system woerner said 
all this underscores just how wrong indeed dangerous it 
would be for the alliance to take a leap of faith and to let down 
its guard said woerner who had been the west german defense 
minister before taking the alliance post last july 1 
woerner said the issue of europe and japan assuming a larger 
share of the common defense burden had been a central theme in his 
first discussions with european leaders and they are committed 
to an equitable sharing of responsibility for collective defense 
he said 
the burdensharing debate must not be allowed to degenerate 
into a numbers game or a transatlantic slanging match he said 
woerner said he would work for a stronger european pillar 
within the alliance but added that it was essential for the 
united states and canada to remain committed to the defense of 
europe 
he said the allies should expand their cooperation outside the 
nato area an idea that has encountered resistance in europe 
the europeans and canadians do not have the same kind of 
superpower responsibilities as the united states but they do have 
a global role woerner said citing examples such as providing 
aid to the third world thwarting libyan aggression in chad and 
patrolling the persian gulf 
woerner met for nearly three hours on tuesday with defense 
secretary frank carlucci and discussed the full range of nato 
issues a defense department spokesman said he is to meet with 
other us officials this week including president reagan on 
friday

investigators from the national transportation 
safety board talked with the captain of delta flight 1141 for the 
first time tuesday afternoon but gleaned no information that could 
pinpoint the cause of the aug 31 crash a board member said 
he does not know why this plane crashed said lee dickinson 
jr who summarized the ntsbs interview with delta capt larry 
davis in a telephone interview from washington dc 
davis who spent nearly two hours talking with investigators 
had been at parkland memorial hospital since his boeing 727 crashed 
as it took off from dallasfort worth international airport 
killing 14 
davis one of 94 survivors was discharged from the hospital 
following the ntsb interview wearing a back brace and with his 
mouth wired shut he left the hospital with his wife and delta 
officials a hospital spokeswoman said 
dickinson said the ntsb hadnt expected the interview with 
captain to yield a clue that might solve the puzzling crash 
although investigators had been awaiting permission to talk to 
davis davis physician had barred investigators from interviewing 
davis earlier 
davis told investigators that the flight from jackson miss to 
dallas had been uneventful and that everything seemed normal again 
as he waited on the taxiway to leave for salt lake city 
he recalled shutting down the right engine to save fuel as the 
plane waited on the runway then restarting it dickinson said 
but as the boeing 727 climbed into the air davis heard two 
loud bangs or explosions davis did not recall any warning 
beforehand to indicate something was amiss 
he previously experienced compressor stalls but nothing like 
this dickinson said 
davis told investigators he went to full power and simply 
tried to keep the airplane in the air but he doesnt recall 
looking down at his instrument panel to see if there were any 
warning signals activated 
investigators had hoped davis might be able to tell them if the 
planes wing flaps had been set correctly but he could only tell 
them that he remembered they were approved in a preflight checklist 
one of the inconsistencies the ntsb had been trying to clear up 
has been the fact the cockpit recording indicated the flaps were in 
a normal takeoff position for a boeing 727 
but wreckage from the plane showed the flaps to be in a 
retracted or improper position 
he said he does not remember anything in relation to the flap 
handle dickinson said

the banning of an antigovernment campaign commercial describing 
alleged torture by president augusto pinochets secret police 
pinochet meanwhile ordered the cancellation of a 
progovernment television advertisement scheduled for tuesday to 
make up for the banning of the oppositions monday night spot 
pinochet the 72yearold army commander who seized power in a 
1973 military coup faces a national referendum oct 5 on a 
proposed eight more years of rule according to governmentapproved 
rules for the campaign his backers and opponents each receive 15 
minutes of free television time nightly 
on monday night only the propinochet spot was aired the 
national television censorship board had objected to a oneminute 
55second segment of the oppositions advertisement that quoted a 
federal judge investigating alleged cases of torture by the secret 
police 
opposition leaders said wednesday the board offered to let them 
substitute a different segment but they refused the board then 
decided to bar airing of the entire 15minute spot 
we dont accept censorship socialist ricardo lagos 
coleader of a 16party opposition coalition told a news 
conference tuesday what happened last night helps to remind us 
that we are facing a dictator and not in a fair electoral battle 
andres zaldivar a christian democrat also leading the 
coalition said its a dictators action 
the absence of the opposition ad sparked potbanging and other 
demonstrations of antigovernment sentiment around santiago 
especially in workingclass neighborhoods 
pinochet made a big mistake zaldivar said in trying to 
do us damage he created a reaction in the people that is 
overwhelmingly in our favor 
denis lustig executive secretary of the censorship board 
called the national television council said it objected to the 
segment because it attempted to involve the judicial power in a 
political campaign 
he said at a news conference that the council had consulted the 
supreme court which said it had not authorized the judges remarks 
the judge rene garcia was quoted in the advertisement as 
saying he is investigating cases of torture involving more than 50 
people arrested by the secret police agency called the national 
information center known by its spanish acronym the cni 
it is duly established that they were arrested by cni agents 
that they were tortured by cni agents in cni jails garcia 
declares in the segment the segment was extracted from a 
television interview garcia gave months ago apparently to a 
foreign network in march he was told by the supreme court to stop 
speaking publicly about the cases 
lagos said the segment had been broadcast in at least 15 other 
countries i ask why they refuse to let chileans see what a 
chilean judge has said and which can be seen in the rest of the 
world he said 
orlando poblete the cabinetrank government general secretary 
told reporters that on tuesday night only the oppositions 
15minute time slot would be broadcast the progovernment spot was 
being canceled at pinochets order to keep the campaign fair he 
said 
if a majority vote yes in the plebiscite pinochet will remain 
president until 1997 if most voters reject him open elections 
will be held in a year and he will hand over power to the winner in 
1990 
the government ordered free television time from 1045 pm to

monday night claimed they were supporters of a rival priest the 
rev arthur volel of the chapel of immaculate conception

wellknown in haiti for their work with the urban poor volel 
denied on private telehaiti tuesday that there was a rivalry

a lawyer for edwin meese iii says the former 
attorney generals reputation has been impugned unfairly by a 
government ethics office memorandum on meese that declares that 
simply avoiding criminal conduct is not the mark of public 
service 
ethics office director frank nebeker said monday that meese 
failed to meet federal ethics requirements by hanging onto 14000 
in telephone stock and by assisting longtime friend e robert 
wallach 
nebekers based his memo on the results of a criminal 
investigation completed this summer by independent counsel james 
mckay although mckay declined to prosecute meese he concluded 
that meese probably broke federal conflictofinterest laws twice 
by handling matters affecting the telecommunications industry at 
the time he held the phone stock 
james rocap a lawyer for meese said in a statement we are 
dismayed by nebekers memo that meeses integrity and 
reputation have been unfairly impugned

martin mull is delighted he has 
found a parking place right in front of the beverly hills 
restaurant but of course his car is white 
blondhaired blueeyed mull has become a white person by 
profession since 1985 due to the success of an innocuous notion he 
and fellow white writer allen rucker had one day the history of 
white people in america 
based on my experiences in ohio and his in oklahoma we 
figured we had the grain belt pretty well in hand mull said over 
lunch a salad with a lot of white stuff in it 
we started describing what makes a person white by our 
standards and in this case the standards were liberal enough they 
could include black people there are certain caucasians who do not 
qualify as well 
a friend at a movie studio told the two they should send the 
idea to the cable television people mull recalled we said send 
what we dont have anything other than the title he said that 
doesnt matter 
mull and rucker produced a twopart cinemax special martin 
mull presents the history of white people in america instructing 
viewers on the identification of the white person habitat the 
midwest its clothing polyester its food tuna noodle casseroles 
and cheezits we were informed the specials were sponsored by the 
institute for white studies in zanesville ohio and funded through 
a grant from tasteefreeze 
the specials were among the most successful cinemax had aired 
and they spawned two bestselling books in 1986 mull and rucker 
followed up with a fourpart series on white religion crime 
stress and politics 
the series has since been packaged for home video 
mull the oncamera host of the series took viewers right into 
the lair of the white people hawkins falls ohio and introduced 
them to quintessential white couple hal and joyce fred willard and 
mary kay place and their offspring debbie and tommy students at 
dinah shore high school 
now cinemax presents white people the movie martin mull in 
portrait of a white marriage premiered on the cable channel last 
week and is being played thursday and on sept 17 20 23 and 28 
the twohour movie takes characters from the instructional series 
and sets them up for a psychocultural crisis even as the day of 
the hawkins falls founders day parade approaches 
white people was often viciously satiric in white 
marriage mull and rucker have softened up the laughs are more 
mainstream and the movie is a virtual homage to oldfashioned 
values in the face of hollywood starshine 
for his part mull is now proud father of a 3yearold daughter 
his wife wendy a composer wrote the score for white marriage 
and has a bit part as an excon trying to start a diaper service 
in the movie mull plays the slick host of ask martin a 
donahuelike talk show when he cant fill a studio in 
pittsburgh he goes to hawkins falls in a pathetic effort to keep 
the show afloat intending to lure starstruck housewives into a 
gymnasium to talk about such subjects as women who have lost 
parts of their bodies through household accidents 
he enlists joyce as his unpaid assistant and falls in love with 
her it seems the big hollywood star actually longs for the 
comforts of a midwestern home meanwhile hal becomes jealous and 
embarks on an affair with the ministers wife julie payne 
michael mckean plays the minister harry shearer who directed 
the movie plays mulls producer robin williams makes a cameo 
appearance as bill loman a salesman who is rooming at the same 
motel as mull 
since completing the movie mull has moved on from white 
people to black comedy hes written a feature film scheduled to 
go before the cameras this fall about two homeless men in new 
york eddie wood and and mr nickles called wood n nickles 
a new movie for cinemax change of heart will mark his 
directing debut i think the word terror is overused but 
apt he said change of heart is a somber comedy mull 
said about a heart transplant that raises the philosophical 
questions implied by the figurative meanings of the word heart

a sign of the times arrived on the market during 
the past couple of weeks a newsletter dedicated to the thesis that 
the way to make money in stocks is to buy undervalued blue chips 
and hold them 
the publishers of blue chip values say they will stress 
fundamental research to find basic values demonstrable through 
such mathematical evidence as priceearnings ratios yields 
pricetobook value and return on equity 
now more than ever good fundamental research is needed to 
bring true values to the surface not hocus pocus and market 
timing trends they say 
what a contrast to a year ago 
back then the stock market was a crazy carnival a whirl of 
noise a blur of activity with excitement kept at a level of 
shrill intensity by thrilling performances fantastic forecasts 
and big winners every other minute 
what expectation what entertainment the spielers and barkers 
outdid each other each attraction seemed bigger and better than 
the other three thousand on the dow thats nothing one of them 
said we forecast 3600 points 
then the tent collapsed on the carnival and all the esoteric 
theories the dow jones industrial average shriveled to half that 
forecast and the shouting was seen for what it was a hysteria of 
avarice and selfdelusion 
and that produced the market setting for gerald perritt and 
cheryl pierce to add their latest basicvalue newsletter to a 
stable that already includes investment horizons fundprobe 
and the mutual fund letter 
their proposal is incredibly simple buy sound common stocks 
whose value can be demonstrated choose value and then wait for 
the market to come to you 
this approach to stocks exchews the daytoday view 
if you need to know daily about your investments then theyre 
not investments says perritt who founded investment information 
services to offer investment counsel and materials after years as a 
mathematics professor 
coeditor pierce observes that small investors must take the 
longterm view rather than attempt to trade those who try she 
says are drawn in only when the market is exciting theyre 
always in and out at the wrong time 
in truth says perritt if people knew how easy investing is 
they wouuldnt need people like me his theories rely on the 
efficiency of the market that is that stocks selling above or 
below value eventually adjust 
but he continues the hypothesis of most market advice is that 
the market isnt efficient when that assumption is made he says 
it becomes a different game altogether one in which frequent and 
often exotic advice is rationalized 
says pierce too few people who buy stock even realize that 
they are buying a business they dont think in such terms theyre 
gambling playing the funny money games 
you arent likely to find hot stocks on the perritt and pierce 
lists there is no stock of the week no telephone hot line why 
would you need such things when your recommendations are these 
exxon florida progress electric utility philip morris and 
wpl holdings electric utility for aboveaverage yield 
deluxe a checkprinter as a special situation 
banc one in banking brunswick in leisure products james 
river in paper products and pfizer in health care chosen in part 
for their low priceearnings ratios 
aetna life amp casualty chosen in part because of its low price 
to book value 
there probably arent any quick bucks in such stocks for 
subscribers or for pierce and perritt 
perritt jests that when matched against the offerings of the 
hucksters and touts their theory of buy and hold seems almost 
unsaleable but maybe the market is ready even at 175 for 17 
issues a year 
as with all investments be patient to promote blue chips 
values the authors offer the first three issues free no 
obligation to subscribe from investment information services 205

the miracle babies who survived in the 
rubble of collapsed hospitals after the mexico city earthquake in 
1985 now are 3yearolds thriving on special attention from 
doctors and relatives 
evelia alvarez gasca goodhumored and playful likes to sing 
and dance her favorite is speedy gonzalez or was before she 
broke the record and pulled the cartridge out of the turntable arm 
sarita valencia corona another of the 19 miracle toddlers 
lives with her grandparents in a community with a view of 
snowcapped volcanos she entertains herself with the chickens 
ducks and cows in the small yard or helps her grandparents tend 
their crops 
jesus manuel figueroa or chuchito possibly the biggest 
miracle of all finally is walking and beginning to talk 
all the babies except chuchito were from a few hours to a few 
days old when the quake struck at 719 am sept 19 1985 
bringing the two hospitals where they were born crashing down 
government figures put the death toll at about 6000 people 
unofficial sources put the toll as high as 32000 including the 
hospitals more than 400 buildings in the city of 18 million were 
destroyed and 5700 damaged the government said 
chuchito was 21 days old when the quake hit in an incubator and 
on intravenous liquids because of problems at birth when the 
12story hospital fell everyone except his mother gave him up for 
dead 
the 19 babies survived amid the rubble from eight hours to 
nearly nine days after the quake cold and almost unconscious 
chuchito was found after a week 
chuchito was just meant to live no matter what happened he 
was going to live said edward sawatzky a canadian who was in 
mexico city when the quake hit and has been helping victims ever 
since 
these babies were under very severe conditions without food 
for a long period with hypothermia hypoglycemia said dr 
barbara hernandez who cares for 14 of them 
they had infected wounds and were dehydrated but only one 
suffered lasting injuries doctors say a boy who suffered a 
deformed hip joint because of infection the boy jesus francisco 
learned to walk four months ago 
hernandez and other doctors say the other babies are normal 
except for one who was born without legs from the knees down and 
chuchito whose slowness in walking and talking they say are due to 
his birth problems 
evelia will have to have surgery on her tear ducts and needs 
orthopedic shoes her aunt said 
about half the children including evelia and sarita lost their 
mothers but all are in what social workers consider to be good 
family situations 
in one sense the babies are lucky they were from poor families 
and have had more medical attention and stimulation than they would 
have had otherwise and they caught the hearts of everyone 
the ones i worry about are the secondary victims who arent 
in the limelight said janet rogozinski head of us private and 
voluntary organizations here the agency channels private donations 
from the united states to earthquake victims 
among them are the six older sisters of lucia another of the 
babies while lucia is cared for by a doting aunt her sisters now 
5 to 12 years old were seriously neglected even though they were 
living in the same household 
with a donation from the united states they are now living and 
going to school in a convent during the week donations also are 
supposed to help build a home for lucias father and sisters on a 
lot left by his wife although neighbors now are claiming the land 
also less fortunate are a boy and his four sisters 3 to 12 who 
lost their parents in the quake and are now in an orphanage 
an american couple was approved as adoptive parents but sources 
familiar with the case say an uncle of the child has blocked the 
process he wants legal custody but does not want the children to 
live with him and denies accusations that he is interested only in 
a trust fund that benefits the children the sources said 
poverty is a besetting problem for the earthquake babies 
families 
saritas father who visits often lives and sells tamales in an 
area of mexico city with no street lighting or other public 
services and dirt streets that are barely passable by car even when 
dry 
evelias aunt uncle and father sell used clothing costume 
jewelry and other items in a market to support themselves and their 
five children 
evelias uncle reynaldo becerra aguillon said sales were down 
and he cant raise his own prices to make up for the higher prices 
they have to pay for food and other items 
we manage to make enough to cover the expenses he said 
not very well but more or less

in the countrys agricultural 
heartland old ingrained fears tinge the debate over the referendum 
next month on gen augusto pinochets presidency 
for prosperous landowners frightening memories of farm seizures 
by leftist peasants in the early 1970s has helped push them solidly 
into the propinochet camp 
this is the fear we have of returning to the past said 
francisco olea owner of a 100acre spread here in the countrys 
fertile central valley 
but for struggling farm workers the prospect of reprisal by 
their bosses or local officials is keeping many from openly voicing 
dissent some say resentment with pinochets authoritarian rule 
and with a handtomouth existence will find expression in the 
ballot box 
at least before there was work and the worker had the right 
to express his opinion said laborer ramon arias as he painted a 
tractor by the roadside two farmhands with him made similar 
comments but refused to give their names 
chileans will decide oct 5 in a yes or no ballot on a new term 
for pinochet the rightwing army commander who seized power in a 
bloody 1973 coup and has already ruled longer than any previous 
president 
if a majority vote for him he will remain as president until 
1997 but the military junta that he has headed as the governing 
body since 1973 will be disbanded if he loses open elections will 
be held in a year and he must hand over power in 1990 when a new 
congress twothirds elected and onethird appointed will go into 
place 
farmowner olea and others like him have benefited from an 
exportoriented freemarket economic program carried out by 
pinochets administration foreign sales of grapes and other fruit 
much of it grown in the central valley have been booming with 
government credits and technological assistance many farm owners 
are expanding production and making solid profits 
but they have not forgotten the chaotic radical reform programs 
launched by president salvador allende a selfdeclared marxist 
elected in 1970 and toppled in the coup led by pinochet three years 
later 
oleas home and land were illegally seized by peasants he 
negotiated with them so he could live in his house which also had 
been taken over while they worked his land as they liked 
we lived through a savage lack of order said luis aullet 
who is partner with his brother cesar in a 70acre farm there 
was no respect for your home your land 
cesar aullet said the allende government sent experts with 
no knowledge of agriculture to supervise land reform programs 
what we fear is that kind of ignorance he said 
the landowners said that with the production boom conditions 
for farm workers were improving significantly 
manpower is becoming scarce and theres competition in 
salaries to attract workers cesar aullet said anyone who 
wants work can find it 
the aullets said that at the height of the harvesting season 
workers could not be found for less than 1000 pesos about twice 
the minimum legal daily wage and equivalent to about 4 
their positive vision of rural chile is shared by pinochets 
campaign strategists who predict overwhelming voter support from 
the heartland 
opposition leaders contend that the countrysides poor majority 
are suffering economically and are eager for a change but wont say 
so publicly because they fear losing their jobs or government 
benefits such as pensions and housing subsidies 
the oppositions political campaign is aimed at overcoming such 
fears while recognizing them as legitimate one prominent campaign 
slogan in the countryside is say yes but vote no 
several farm workers said harvesting jobs paid an average 700 
pesos or less than 3 a day and lasted only a few months a year 
you cant live on that arias said 
jorge contreras who sells bread from the back of his small 
battered truck in the countryside around san fernando said most of 
his customers opposed pinochets continued rule 
i travel 50 kilometers 30 miles a day and i can tell you 
there are a lot more people for the no vote than the yes 
vote he said 
but he added lots of people may vote yes because theyre 
afraid he said that in one remote town on his bread route 
tinguiririca alto people are telling each other that if you vote 
no youll be arrested 
the government has said the vote will be secret and the 
opposition has publicized its plans to have representatives at each 
polling place to prevent intimidation

cruz ayala marroquin has spent his 
working life for the past quarter century standing knee deep in the 
las canas river shoveling sand onto the bank 
he is an arenero a sanddigger and ekes out a meager 
existence supplying sand for construction sites in san salvador 
the capital 10 miles to the south 
manuel de jesus spends his time pulling an ironwheeled wagon 
loaded with 800 pounds of bananas from the eastern bus terminal to 
san salvadors central market 
neither has anything to show for his work except the sinewy 
muscle of his arms and back what they earn with their toil is not 
so much a living as another days survival 
the hard life is harder for the poor in el salvador 
though there is no official parameter such as a poverty 
line it is clear that the great majority of el salvadors 55 
million people are poor 
the us agency for international development says 27 percent of 
children under 5 are malnourished infant mortality is 91 per 1000 
live births the highest rate in central america 
half the population lacks safe drinking water and the leading 
cause of death is intestinal infection according to the ministry 
of health only four out of 10 people can read and write 
with this you make enough to eat thats it says the 
grizzled ayala 55 pausing to lean on his shovel he and his wife 
reared seven children in a tworoom adobe house three of the six 
boys became sanddiggers 
ayala rises every day including sunday at 3 am so as to be 
at the river by 4 the first trucks arrive at dawn by which time 
ayala has shoveled a ton of sand 
on a good day hell dig three or four oneton truckloads and 
make 15 to 20 colones 3 to 4 with that his wife will buy rice 
beans tortillas perhaps a few eggs and some cheese enough for 
the couple and their one remaining dependent child 
you cant save a colon he says the few cents you set 
aside go up in smoke with an illness something like that 
he says he feels strong and plans on working at least five more 
years hell depend on help from his sons when he can no longer 
work 
ramon aristedes najarro who digs about 50 yards downriver from 
ayala is 48 years old and feels his strength draining he doesnt 
even want to think about how hell get by when his back gives out 
ill just have to find something else selling newspapers or 
maybe ill have to beg 
at the san salvadors central market manuel de jesus takes a 
break with three other carretoneros or cartpullers seated on 
their sturdy wagons a sweet slightly nauseating odor wafts across 
the narrow street from a pile of rotten or mashed bananas 
a middleaged woman searches through the pile for still edible 
fruit 
the cartpullers like the sanddiggers make about 3 on an 
average day de jesus 28 and granadeno perez 29 sleep in a 
nearby flophouse that charges 2 a night for a piece of cardboard 
on the floor and water for bathing that leaves them a dollar for 
food and for booze 
sometimes we go without eating to buy guaro says perez 
already in a semistupor from the cane liquor by 10 am all four 
cartpullers readily admitted they try to maintain a constant 
alcoholic haze 
several times a day they come up with the five colones to buy a 
halfliter of muneco the cheapest guaro 
its very hard this life said de jesus theres no 
future in it it damages your body the only thing youre left with 
are the knocks he motioned to perezs bandaged hand sprained 
from the strain of hauling 
asked his feelings about leftist guerrillas who say they are 
fighting for the poor ayala said i understand nothing of 
politics but some say they the guerrillas would make this 
another nicaragua i dont want that 
none of the sanddiggers or cartpullers interviewed could read 
and none has ever voted democracy which returned to el salvador 
in 1982 after decades of military rule means little to them 
democracy has done nothing says najarro it hasnt 
created jobs you look out for yourself and get by as best you 
can 
i doubt the country can progress says ayala i dont have 
faith

melody baldwin poisoned her first child her 
second is on the way now the judge who controls her fate has 
proposed an unorthodox solution to her troubled life 
sterilization 
the proposal has thrust the expectant mother into a thorny legal 
debate over crime and punishment and whether the courts are playing 
god or protecting society 
an outcry arose after judge roy jones suggested he might be more 
lenient if miss baldwin were sterilized before he sentences her for 
feeding her 4yearold son joshua fatal doses of psychiatric 
drugs prescribed for her 
she is a person who no longer needs to ever have any 
children jones said if she becomes a mother again he warned 
the possibility is there for the same thing to happen 
miss baldwin due to give birth late this month has signed a 
consent form agreeing to sterilization her attorney says but her 
prospect of trading motherhood for a reduced prison term has 
outraged civil libertarians feminists and the county prosecutor 
who say jones proposal would deny her a most fundamental right 
i dont think its appropriate for the court deciding who 
should have a child and who shouldnt said richard waples legal 
director of the indiana civil liberties union youre authorizing 
a decision on reproductive capabilities that is dangerously close 
to eugenics a form of selective breeding thats something that 
is foreign to our system and beliefs about the sanctity of human 
life and the limited power of the state 
it reminds me of the islamic punishment of cutting off a hand 
for theft said lawyer pequita buis state legislative 
coordinator for the national organization for women we dont 
engage in physical mutilation for punishment in this country 
jones insists his proposal isnt punitive or inconsistent with 
now tenets 
they are the biggest advocates i am aware of how a woman 
should have the right to control her own body he said all i 
suggested to miss baldwin is that she in fact think about that do 
something to control her own body 
miss baldwin who has told her attorney she will surrender her 
baby for adoption pleaded guilty in june to neglect of a dependent 
giving her son drugs after the state agreed to drop murder 
charges 
shortly afterwards miss baldwin then six months pregnant was 
hospitalized for weight loss shes since been moved to a 
psychiatric ward awaiting the prospect of six to 20 years in 
prison 
jones says if miss baldwin rejects sterilization it wont hurt 
her in court if she agrees he says it could ease mental pressure 
and be a mitigating factor 
her attorney michael donahoe says he doesnt think his client 
should become a mother again because she doesnt seem to be 
mentally financially or legally in a position to raise a child in 
a responsible way 
but donahoe says he fears that if she is sterilized her 
already low selfesteem would be reduced almost to nothing 
the ethical and legal questions raised in this case have 
surfaced elsewhere where court rulings have touched on the most 
intimate aspects of life 
this month an arizona judge reversed her order requiring an 
18yearold mother to practice birth control throughout her 
childbearing years after she left two infant sons alone in a 
sweltering apartment for three days the judge said the order was 
unenforceable because of the fallibility of birth control the 
woman is pregnant again 
in 1985 three convicted rapists in south carolina were 
resentenced after the state supreme court said a judges decision 
to let them choose castration over prison violated safeguards 
against cruel and unusual punishment 
and in michigan in 1986 the state supreme court upheld a 
5to15year prison term imposed on upjohn co heir roger gauntlett 
in place of the chemical castration originally levied after he 
pleaded no contest to raping a 14yearold stepdaughter

the chemical castration part of a sentence that included a year 
in prison and four years probation involved taking depoprovera 
an experimental upjohn drug used to reduce male sex drive 
such debates arent new in 1942 the us supreme court struck 
down an oklahoma law allowing sterilization of certain groups of 
felons noting that marriage and procreation are fundamental to 
the very existence and survival of the race in evil or 
reckless hands it can cause races or types which are inimical to 
the dominant group to wither and disappear 
and similar language is being used today 
i dont understand where any court in this country is 
qualified to tell people whos fit to breed and who isnt 
said garrett simpson an arizona public defender representing the 
woman originally sentenced to birth control 
it doesnt take a huge jump from who can have children to 
whose life is meaningful and whose isnt he said these are 
questions the law isnt capable of answering 
but others argue alternative sentences can be effective 
we have a very very destructive system said daniel polsby 
a northwestern university law professor we send too many people 
down the river weve got to be more creative if there are 
people that you can handle in some other way handle them in some 
other way 
and although polsby agreed with the need to protect rights he 
said 20 years of close confinement in a penitentiary is as 
serious a deprivation of civil liberties as you can imagine short 
of being killed 
thats a good possibility for miss baldwin a 29yearold 
unemployed waitress with a history of emotional problems and 
selfabuse 
last summer while awaiting trial miss baldwin injected urine 
in her breasts a bizarre act donahoe said stemmed from frustration 
and depression many years ago he said she nicked her wrists with 
a razor 
miss baldwins behavior was scrutinized shortly after joshuas 
birth when medical workers noticed the babys repeated coughing 
vomiting and breathing difficulties occurred only when his mother 
was alone with him 
donahoe said the boy was placed in a foster home but was 
returned to his mother several weeks later when suspicions of abuse 
could not be proven 
on aug 28 1986 joshua was hospitalized with a cough five 
days later after improving steadily he suddenly grew lethargic 
he was in a coma by the next morning on sept 5 life support was 
turned off 
an autopsy found he had died from drugs likely given within 24 
hours of cardiac arrest which caused his brain death the drugs 
specifically an antidepressant and an antipsychotic were 
dispensed to his mother 
originally prosecutors claimed miss baldwin turned off an alarm 
on a monitor that would have alerted nurses to joshuas sudden 
change in brain activity she denied the allegation and it was 
dropped from the final charges before the plea agreement 
the accusation was mirrored this summer when a doctor said miss 
baldwin disconnected a tube providing nourishment to her and her 
fetus 
donahoe said his client was having trouble keeping food down 
but attorney timothy bookwalter representing the fetus said miss 
baldwin engaged in selfinduced vomiting to create a medical 
calamity involving the unborn child 
shes killed one child purposely he said she has tried 
to cause a premature birth of a second one anybody who doesnt 
think she was trying to harm the two would have to be crazy 
donahoe disagrees i really believe more than anyone on this 
planet she wants to bring a healthy baby into this world he 
said there might be a connection between that need and what 
shes been convicted of 
whatever she chooses donahoe says her future is bleak 
the idea of sterilization makes her feel like shes being 
treated like an animal he said and if shes imprisoned being 
kept in a cage is being kept like an animal her dilemma is how 
shes going to be treated like an animal

mars closest approach to earth in 17 
years and the best northern hemisphere view of the red planet in 
113 years has backyard astronomers peering excitedly through 
telescopes 
a network of 500 mostly amateur astronomers in 33 countries has 
been organized for mars watch 88 by the international mars patrol 
and the planetary society which has dubbed the occasion a close 
encounter of the red kind 
unless youre on the north pole or south pole youll get good 
views of mars through telescopes until middecember said dr 
donald parker a coral gables fla anesthesiologist and mars 
recorder for the patrol which is part of the association of 
lunar and planetary observers 
you can see the surface the clouds and the polar ice caps and 
really realize it is a whole world parker said occasionally 
weve seen shadows cast by big dust storms its really neat 
for observers in the northern hemisphere mars is more 
favorably positioned than at any time from 1875 through 2025 
because its not only closer but farther north in the sky than 
usual said jeff beish an eastern airlines flight simulator 
technician in miami who also collects reports for the mars patrol 
mars watchers already have provided 1200 reports photographs 
and sketches to parker and beish who send key findings to jet 
propulsion laboratory astronomer stephen edberg who coordinates 
mars watch 88 during his spare time 
the observations mean when we send cosmonauts or astronauts to 
mars were going to have a better understanding of the planet 
said edberg mountaineers use telescopes to look at routes before 
they try them the same goes for preparing for manned exploration 
of a planet 
the pasadenabased planetary society is a nonprofit group 
lobbying for manned exploration of mars 
at 818 pm pdt on sept 21 earth and mars will be 3654 
million miles apart the closest since they were 3492 million 
miles apart in august 1971 said telescope demonstrator anthony 
cook of los angeles griffith observatory 
mars and earth are close now because on aug 12 mars was at 
perihelion its closest approach to the sun while at 825 pm 
pdt sept 27 it will reach opposition meaning it is on the 
opposite side of earth from the sun they wont be so close again 
until aug 27 2003 when they get within 3465 million miles they 
sometimes are as far as 248 million miles apart and as far as 63 
million miles apart during nonperihelion oppositions 
oppositions occur about every 26 months but favorable or 
close oppositions occur every 15 to 17 years even then 
excellent views usually are available only to southern hemisphere 
residents 
to the naked eye or through binoculars mars now is easily 
visible all night as a reddishorange spark the evening skys 
second brightest object after the moon 
for northern hemisphere viewers mars appears low in the 
eastsoutheast after dark at midnight it is halfway between the 
southern horizon and a point directly overhead before dawn it is 
low in the westsouthwest for southern hemisphere observers mars 
is in the eastnortheast in the evening appears halfway between 
the northern horizon and a point directly overhead at midnight 
then is visible before dawn low in the westnorthwest 
people who want detailed views can attend telescope sessions 
sponsored by the planetary society planetariums colleges science 
centers and astronomy clubs 
the smallest telescopes capable of providing detailed views of 
mars are 3inch refractors or 4inch reflectors each with 
150power magnification cook said because time on big telescopes 
is dominated by observations of distant stars and galaxies most 
of the roundtheclock watch of the planet is kept by amateur 
astronomers 
parker 49 has spent nights outdoors to watch mars for 40 
years i have very bad arthritis and get mosquito bites but i 
look at this damn planet and it makes my whole day he said i 
hope in my lifetime men will get to mars its always been a dream 
of mine

pillsbury co expects its first quarter 
operating income to be flat due to continued sluggish sales by its 
burger king fastfood restaurant chain the companys chairman said 
tuesday 
philip l smith in his first major public appearance as the 
food and restaurant companys new chairman told pillsburys annual 
meeting that comparable burger king restaurant sales were off 2 
percent in the first quarter of fiscal 1989 from the same period 
last year 
the decline extended a trend that contributed to a major 
restructuring in the previous year which sharply reduced 
pillsburys net earnings pillsbury had net earnings in fiscal 1988 
of 693 million or 81 cents a share compared with 1819 
million or 210 a share in fiscal 1987 
smith said that for the first quarter of fiscal 1989 operating 
results should be virtually flat although net income will be up 
about 25 percent because of a onetime benefit in deferred taxes 
foods will have an excellent first quarter but restaurants 
as i indicated will be down because of the investment expenses we 
are incurring and because of continued sluggish sales at burger 
king smith said 
besides spending 30 million this year to upgrade training and 
add new managerial staff at burger king pillsbury will begin a 
150 million capital improvement plan to add 60 new company stores 
and upgrade existing stores smith said 
the longterm profit performance for the whole company makes 
it essential that we succeed and there is no reason why we 
cannot smith said i will be present in miami at our burger 
king headquarters frequently to provide encouragement and to assist 
in making the right judgments with a clear sense of urgency 
smith said he expects profit growth in the foods division during 
the coming fiscal years and an overall solid financial gain 
despite the expenses incurred to improve restaurant sales 
he said the companys sampa restaurant corp which operates the 
fullservice chains of steak and ale and bennigans experienced 
its first upturn in average restaurant sales in four years during 
the first quarter of this year 
in last years restructuring the subsidiary dropped two small 
chains got out of the hotel food service business and closed 23 
underperforming steak and ale restaurants

hugh hefner whose name is synonymous with 
playboy magazine has decided to step down as chairman and chief 
executive officer of the business empire he launched with a 600 
investment 
hefner 62 issued a statement monday that he would not run for 
reelection to the board of directors of playboy enterprises inc 
the magazines parent company the directors election is scheduled 
following playboys shareholders meeting nov 10 
hefners daughter christie who has run the daytoday 
operations of the company since 1982 is expected to be elected to 
the posts now held by her father the statement said 
the company also revealed it would receive a sevenfigure 
advance from bantam books inc which is publishing hefners 
autobiography 
hefner who mortgaged his furniture and invested 600 of his own 
to publish the first issue of playboy in december 1953 called the 
change just another evolutionary step consistent with my own 
personal plans 
christie hefner said in a statement that she hopes to expand 
playboys licensing television and video businesses 
the geographic reach of the company also will continue to be 
expanded she said with new markets such as india and eastern 
bloc countries opening up for playboylicensed products and 
foreign distribution of home video and television programs 
growing 
ms hefner 35 who over the past six years returned the company 
to profitability by selling off its sour businesses now is 
president chief operating officer and vice chairwoman of playboy 
enterprises 
after she becomes playboys top board executive the companys 
founder will remain the major stockholder with the titles of 
chairman emeritus and editorinchief of playboy magazine the 
companys statement said 
christie has had my full support since she took responsibility 
for the daytoday operations of the company in april of 1982 
hefner said in a statement 
under ms hefners business direction playboy enterprises 
closed the last of its us key clubs and shed its interests in 
movie theaters modeling and book and record clubs playboy 
enterprises made a 26 million profit in 1988 
dan lee an analyst with drexel burnahm lambert inc in new 
york speculated hefner may have stepped down to spend less time on 
business and more on his fiancee kimberley conrad 26 playboys 
playmate of the month for january 
in a business sense christie hefner has largely been running 
the company for the past several years but he owns about 80 
percent of playboys stock so there wont be any dramatic 
changes lee said 
i think in terms of the company overall it is a changing of 
the guard a sort of passing the reins along said playboy 
spokeswoman robyn radomski 
in terms of where the company is now its a logical step 
but hef is still going to be editorinchief of the magazine and 
be involved in major strategic decisions

macmillan incs agreement to a 236 billion 
takeover by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co doesnt rule out a 
higher offer from british publisher robert maxwell but some 
securities analysts believe his effort to acquire the us 
publishingandinformation giant has been doomed 
being a rational person i would think at this point he would 
withdraw his offer bert boksen an investment strategist at 
raymond james amp associates in st petersburg fla said monday 
after macmillans deal with kohlberg was announced but maxwell 
is known to be unpredictable 
kohlberg kravis 85ashare cash and securities acquisition if 
successful would conclude macmillans struggle to thwart unwelcome 
takeover attempts by maxwell and texas investor robert bass 
david bonderman an official at the bass groups headquarters in 
fort worth texas declined to comment andrew turner a spokesman 
for maxwell at his oxford england offices said weve received 
this report and are studying it 
wall street reacted skeptically to whether a higher offer would 
emerge macmillan stock rose 87 cents a share to 8475 in new 
york stock exchange composite trading on monday 
analysts were divided on maxwells next move while some thought 
he would abandon his pursuit of the company others said he could 
increase the bid because his 84ashare offer was so close to 
kohlbergs 85 
i would not be surprised if we would see more from maxwell 
said bruce thorp who follows the publishing industry for provident 
national bank in philadelphia you might be able to make the 
argument that his allcash of 84 is more attractive if so hes 
still in contention 
but j kendrick noble a macmillan analyst at painewebber group 
inc in new york said i think the kkrmacmillan bid is probably 
the last bid should maxwell come back a buck higher theres no 
assurance kkr and macmillan management might not stretch their 
bid 
macmillans deal with kohlberg marks another multibilliondollar 
acquisition for the investment firm a specialist in leveraged 
buyouts 
these acquisitions in which a company is bought largely with 
borrowed funds that are repaid through its earnings cash flow or 
asset sales remain a frenetic area of corporate takeover 
activity kohlberg is one of the leaders having played crucial 
roles in four of the biggest leveraged buyouts of the past three 
years 
securities analysts said the macmillan acquisition also might 
radically alter the structure of the company a leading publisher 
of educational materials with other businesses ranging from 
directmail marketing to the berlitz chain of language training 
schools 
some speculated that kohlberg kravis would sell either 
macmillans publishing or information division to help finance the 
acquisition others said gumps a macmillanowned chain of 
highquality retail stores and a mailorder business might be sold 
neither kohlberg nor macmillan officials would speculate on the 
possible sale of any macmillan units 
under terms of the agreement a kolhberg subsidiary will begin a 
tender offer of 85 cash per share for up to 261 million shares of 
the company or 94 percent of the total kohlberg will offer a 
package of securities it valued at 85 per share for the remaining 
6 percent 
if all shareholders tender their shares kohlberg will offer 
them 80 cash and 5 in securities per share the total offer 
values the companys 2776 million shares at 236 billion 
the bass group which owns about 92 percent of macmillans 
shares had a 75ashare offer outstanding for the company but 
most analysts believed that was basss way of raising the stocks 
value through takeover speculation if the bass group sold its 
shares to kohlberg it would make about 75 million

members of congress wary of granting banks new 
securities powers are marshaling evidence to back their position by 
looking at us banks overseas operations 
rep john d dingell dmich called a meeting of his energy 
and commerce oversight subcommittee today to review a general 
accounting office report suggesting banks may have problems 
handling new powers 
although banks are barred from most securities activities in the 
united states federal reserve rules permit bank subsidiaries to 
trade and underwrite securities abroad 
the gao at the request of rep edward j markey dmass 
looked at how large us banks with european operations fared in 
the london markets in 1986 and 1987 
bank examination reports indicate that most of the london 
securities subsidiaries of us banks recorded losses or were 
marginally profitable the report said noting that the problems 
were made worse by the world stock market crash in october 1987 
the gao attributed us banks poor showing in london in part to 
significant management and internal control problems however 
it also took note of the turbulence of the london market which 
recently had been deregulated by the british government 
eighteen of the 50 us banks operating in london engaged in at 
least some securities underwriting and dealing the watchdog agency 
said 
in several instances during the period of the crash london 
securities subsidiaries were forced to call on their parent us 
banks for infusions of capital to make up for losses it said 
this study foreshadows the threat to our banking system if 
banks are allowed unfettered entry into our domestic securities 
markets said markey chairman of the house energy and commerce 
finance subcommittee 
dingell and markey are using the study in their efforts to 
counter bills that would repeal or substantially alter the 1933 
glasssteagall act which separated commercial and investment 
banking in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent 
wave of bank failures 
bills granting banks new securities powers have passed the full 
senate and the house banking committee the legislation must be 
reviewed by dingells committee before the full house can act 
both dingell and markey have expressed skepticism about relaxing 
the glasssteagall barriers in a television interview over the 
weekend dingell said if i have any say such legislation will 
not be enacted this year

taiwan plans to cut import tariffs on 
several additional products including mineral oils and cooling 
equipment to help reduce trade friction with the united states a 
newspaper reported tuesday 
the widely circulated china times quoted unidentified financial 
officials as saying taiwan would lower tariffs on the 56 
competitive us products to effectively ease trade tension 
between taiwan and its chief trading partner 
for each of the 56 items usmade products currently make up 
more than 20 percent of taiwans imports of that item the 
newspaper said 
wang fujen a customs administration official declined to 
comment on the newspaper report 
last month taiwan announced it would cut import tariffs on 335 
other items later this month 
the newspaper said tariffs would be cut for 52 of the 175 items 
for which us negotiators requested reductions during trade talks 
in april 
however tariffs will be cut for only two of the 102 
agricultural items requested by the us side because taiwanese 
officials believe local farmers need protection the newspaper said 
the new items include broth mineral oils compressors and 
cooling equipment it said 
in february tariffs on 3500 items were cut by an average of 50 
percent in taiwans most sweeping tariff cuts 
taiwan has been under us pressure to reduce its large 
bilateral trade surplus trade between taiwan and the united states 
last year totaled 312 billion with taiwans exports exceeding 
imports by 16 billion 
during the first eight months of this year taiwans imports 
from the united states totaled 93 billion up 102 percent from a 
year earlier its bilateral trade surplus totaled 64 billion

inflation and labor shortages are two major 
economic problems facing hong kong financial secretary piers 
jacobs said tuesday 
jacobs in an evaluation of the economys performance also 
slightly revised his projection of this years growth rate to 6 
percent from 5 percent still well below the 135 percent rate for 
1987 
interest rate increases in the united states and europe and the 
slower economic growth worldwide are contributing factors in the 
decline in growth of the british colonys exportfueled economy he 
said 
jacobs noted however that the local economy is still 
operating close to capacity so that inflation and labor shortages 
continue to be our two major concerns 
he said the inflation rate was expected to hit 75 percent this 
year slightly higher than previously projected the unemployment 
rate 18 percent in june has reached historic lows resulting in 
rapid increases of wages and salaries jacobs added 
the government is considering easing a ban on the import of 
foreign labor because of the widespread labor shortages but jacobs 
did not say whether he favored such a move

international business machines corp says the 
internal design of its personal system2 computers is the path to 
the future but its rivals are heading in a different direction 
compaq computer corp and a host of others including 
hewlettpackard co tandy corp italys ing c olivetti amp co 
spa japans nec corp and epson america inc and zenith data 
systems are rallying around an alternative to the micro channel 
found inside the more expensive models of ibms personal system2 
the rivals say their bus which controls the way information 
is passed between components of a computer is a simpler and less 
disruptive transition from the bus of the at personal computer than 
ibms micro channel is 
the new bus dubbed eisa for extended industry standard 
architecture was unveiled today at a new york news conference 
the companies expect that the first products incorporating the 
new bus will begin to emerge in late 1989 said rod canion the 
president and chief executive of compaq 
other companies pledging support to the new standard were intel 
corp the chip maker microsoft corp the software company and 
several leading makers of communications equipment and software 
i think it eisa will be a problem for ibm norman weizer 
an analyst at arthur d little inc in cambridge mass said 
monday i think ibm did misguess as to how closely its technology 
would be followed 
even ibm has acknowledged that not all customers want its new 
micro channel the cheaper members of its personal system2 line 
dont have it and ibm was expected to unveil two more of those 
models today 
the new machines will use the same microprocessor as ibms old 
at and will be aggressively priced 
ibm fears uncontrolled copying of its technology which would 
keep it from preventing shoddy knockoffs and deprive it of 
licensing payments to defray the expense of its research and 
development 
but if no other company copies the internal design of the new 
personal system2 line it wont become an industry standard and 
software developers wont create many programs for it without good 
software available customers wont want to buy the machine 
ibms competitors say there is no good reason for computer 
buyers to adopt the micro channel 
analysts say eisa will speed up the movement of information but 
still allow computers to use older addon equipment such as memory 
cards graphics cards and data storage devices 
customers buying ibms ps2 have to buy all new addon 
equipment although there is less need for it because there are 
more builtin features 
there is little ibm can do about the rival effort except try to 
convince computer users that its design offers more room for growth 
in the long run 
even if ibms micro channel ultimately prevails the new bus 
from the rival coalition is likely to slow down the development of 
new programs by fragmenting the efforts of software developers 
software developers may prefer to concentrate their efforts on 
programs for computers that dont use micro channel especially if 
the new bus gives them a new lease on life said bruce l davis 
chairman of the software publishers association 
the question is whether we need to make the technological leap 
to the micro channel architecture right now said davis who is 
also president and chief executive of mediagenic in menlo park

a federal judge has ruled that united 
airlines and american airlines did not conspire to fix fees on 
their computerized reservation systems as several other carriers 
had charged 
in handing down his decision monday us district judge edward 
rafeedie held that the airlines had no evidence to support any 
inference of conspiracy but were relying solely on speculation 
the plaintiffs including continental airlines usair group 
inc northwest airlines had sought more than 11 billion in 
recovery of such fees paid to american and united from 1984 to 1987 
chicagobased united is the nations largest airline while 
american based in fort worth is the second biggest 
american considers this to be a major victory anne h 
mcnamara the airlines senior vice president and general counsel 
said monday 
we feel totally vindicated by the decision because the judge 
recognized the conspiracy charges for what they are absolute 
speculation 
in their antitrust complaint against american and united the 
plaintiffs contended the defendants participated in a conspiracy 
spanning several years to raise the other carriers cost of doing 
business 
specifically plaintiffs accused the two airlines of illegally 
agreeing to fix the price of booking fees charged by sabre and 
apollo the american and united computerized reservations systems 
respectively beginning in november 1984 
at that time american announced it would charge other airlines 
175 per booking for the sabre service united later established a 
price of 185 
the plaintiffs also alleged the two defendants unlawfully forced 
other carriers to pay what the industry terms interline ticketing 
fees which are paid when one airline issues a ticket on its own 
internal ticket stock for travel on another airline such as 
when a passengers itinerary involves two or more carriers for a 
single trip 
the court found american and united had met their procedural 
burden of showing each had independently decided on the level of 
booking fees after november 1984 and on establishment of a 
reimbursement charge for interline ticketing services 
on aug 12 rafeedie granted americans and uniteds motions for 
summary judgment on two of three of the plaintiffs principal 
monopolization theories that sabre and apollo are essential 
facilities and that the defendants engaged in monopoly 
leveraging

the unions demanded increases in basic wage rates to restore 
cuts accepted two years ago when the companies sought concessions 
to withstand a recession in the industry but the companies balked 
offering annual bonuses and production incentives instead

kroger co said today it was exploring a 377 
billion defensive restructuring that would plunge the supermarket 
giant into debt and force it to sell assets after the haft family 
well known for hostile takeover attempts won federal clearance to 
acquire a chunk of the company 
the nations largest grocery chain which operates more than 
1300 supermarkets 900 convenience stores and other operations in 
29 states said in a statement that the possible restructuring was 
prompted partly by the high level of takeover and restructuring 
activity involving supermarket companies 
the statement also mentioned a federal trade commission ruling 
friday that allows the hafts a marylandbased clan of corporate 
takeover strategists who have unsuccessfully chased other 
supermarket chains but made huge profits in the process to acquire 
at least 15 million worth of kroger stock 
kroger said the restructuring would involve substantial but 
unspecified bank loans pay shareholders 48 in cash and securities 
per share and allow them to keep their stock kroger has about 
7857 million shares outstanding 
the substantial debt would be repaid from cash flow from 
operations disposition of noncore and underproductive assets 
significant reduction in capital expenditures and reduced 
expenses lyle everingham chairman and chief executive officer 
of the cincinnatibased company said in the statement the ftc 
ruling was the first official sign of the hafts interest in 
kroger but the commissions statement did not say how much kroger 
stock the hafts want to buy representatives for the hafts declined 
to comment 
krogers stock has traded heavily over the past five months 
partly because of rumors that the hafts and other potential 
acquirers were interested in the company 
news of the commissions decision started circulating friday 
sending krogers stock up 125 in heavy trading to close at 38 a 
share on monday the companys stock closed up another 150 at 
3950 also on heavy trading 
one analyst predicted that the hafts would likely break up 
kroger if they purchased it 
its almost certain that theyll start dismantling the company 
and selling off its assets said gary m giblen vice president 
at rotanmosle a houstonbased subsidiary of the investment firm 
of painewebber inc 
but giblen also said that robert haft and his father herbert 
who operate the dart group of landover md may be serious about 
running a grocery company they demonstrated that earlier this 
spring when they bought a small washington dc grocery chain 
instead of selling it off for the cash the hafts are using the 
company to learn how to manage a grocery firm giblen said 
the hafts have failed in their efforts to buy such companies as 
safeway supermarkets general and stop amp shop but have made 
profits in selling stock shares back to those companies

a federal judge has ruled that monsanto 
co also could be held liable for damages from the copper7 
intrauterine device that is produced by its subsidiary gd searle 
amp co 
the ruling monday by us district judge robert renner 
represents a second legal setback for monsanto involving the 
copper7 device which was taken off the market in 1986 a year 
after monsanto acquired searle 
last week searle was ordered by a jury to pay 875 million in 
punitive and compensatory damages to esther kociemba an elk river 
minn woman who said the iud caused her to become sterile 
in the latest case renner ruled that julie daher of columbia 
heights minn could sue both searle and monsanto for damages from 
a copper7 she used between october 1984 and october 1987 
monsanto based in st louis mo had been named as 
codefendant in about two dozen copper7 cases but all of those 
cases had been dismissed in court or dropped by the plaintiffs 
until mondays decision 
monsanto stock plunged after the ruling monday falling 712 
to 7862 in active trading on the new york stock exchange in 
early trading today it was off another 150 to 7712 
dahers attorneys claim monsanto acted in concert with searle in 
misrepresenting the safety of the copper7 and fraudulently 
concealing dangers associated with the device after it acquired 
searle in october 1985 for 28 billion 
legal experts have said fridays jury verdict could result in 
thousands of lawsuits against searle 
monsanto maintains there simply is no justification for the 
jurys action

a contraption that sucks bad bugs off 
strawberry plants may become a handy tool for farmers in the drive 
to kill pests without using so many chemicals 
three farming members of driscoll strawberry associates inc of 
watsonville in northern california are using a companydesigned 
machine called a bugvac this year to vacuum lygus bugs off their 
plants 
the custommade vacuum machine mounted on a tractor moves down 
rows of young berries providing just enough suction to zap lygus 
bugs that like to live near the top of the plants 
beneficial insects that live lower on the plants are not 
disturbed by the machine explained driscoll researcher ed show 
green leaves and the ripening fruit also are left unharmed 
show adapted the idea from a hand vacuum the university of 
california developed years ago to test the levels of insect 
populations the researchers innovation consists of hydraulically 
driven fans and suction hoses 
the vacuum doesnt deep clean the whole strawberry plant 
show said in an interview were affecting only the bugs on the 
top part of the plant it will suck up and remove bugs of all 
kinds the good and the bad but its not as detrimental to the 
beneficial insect community 
perhaps the main benefit from the bugvac is saving the 
beneficial insects needed to eat other damaging bugs such as 
western spider mites which have become resistant to pesticides 
we have no effective miticides to control spider mites so if 
we spray for lygus bugs we create a real spider mite problem 
because we knock out the beneficial insects show says 
vacuum cleaning the plants does not eliminate as many lygus bugs 
as spraying them with pesticides would however growers who tried 
the new technique were able to keep the lygus bug population close 
to or slightly below what is termed the economic threshold in 
integrated pest management the level at which the pest population 
causes financial losses 
were learning how many lygus bugs we can get away with in a 
field show said 
the board of driscoll associates which provides its own 
patented strawberry varieties to affiliated growers asked show to 
find ways to reduce or eliminate as much use of pesticides as 
possible because of increasing regulatory restrictions increasing 
resistance by bugs to some chemicals and doubts about whether 
adequate new chemicals will become available 
show decided to adapt the dvac machine a handheld or backpack 
device used to suck up small numbers of pests in estimating how 
badly a field is infested 
given that basic idea we built a prototype on bicycle wheels 
pushed it through test plots and found it could catch what seemed 
like an impressive number of lygus bugs show said 
this was the first season growers used shows device 
commercially and the three who had machines built seem satisfied 
with the results 
reiter affiliated of watsonville used a bugvac on 71 acres of 
strawberries at salinas about 125 miles south of san francisco 
and plans to have two more machines built for use on all of the 
companys 225 acres next year 
general manager tom jones estimates the vacuum machine saved 
100200 an acre over the cost of pesticides and owner miles 
reiter said the savings may even be higher 
its been a real good deal for us jones said 
mike mccluney of watsonville who manufactures the bugvacs says 
hes now built nine or 10 and has orders for at least that many 
more with still other farmers considering the device the cost of 
the machines runs between 12000 and 17000 
it definitely does work under most circumstances when properly 
used with integrated pest management and other methods mccluney 
said its not just a replacement for a spray tractor but needs 
to be in conjunction with predator releases 
use of the bugvac may spread from strawberries to other 
california vegetables such as lettuce 
theres interest on the part of some other vegetable 
growers said show adding that he has heard of at least one 
maine farmer who uses a similar apparatus to control potato beetles 
mccluney said he plans a trip to brawley in southeastern 
california to see if we can use this new idea to help out with 
their white fly problem

corn and soybean futures opened lower today on 
the chicago board of trade while wheat traded higher all in 
reaction to mondays crop production report from agriculture 
department 
the governments new harvest projections of 446 billion bushels 
of corn and 147 billion bushels of soybeans were higher than the 
market had expected prompting many players to sell contracts for 
future delivery of those commodities analysts said 
the usdas wheat production number 181 billion bushels also 
was higher than expected but its bearish implications were more 
than offset by new government predictions of lower grain production 
in the soviet union and canada and a forecast for increased grain 
imports by the soviets the united states is negotiating a new 
longterm agreement to supply grain to the soviets 
demand concerns have replaced supply fears as the main influence 
on crop futures prices and will continue to dominate trading as the 
corn and soybean harvest progresses said ted mao grain specialist 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
the key is how is the demand going to respond when are the 
spurts of business going to come how is the market going to handle 
the fact that over the next 60 days we are going to be harvesting 
and maximizing the supply side in the us he said 
in early trading wheat was 3 cents to 6 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 408 a bushel corn was 1 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with september at 285 a bushel 
oats were cent to 2 cents higher with december at 275 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cents to 8 cents lower with september at 
866 a bushel 
cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in 
early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 22 cent to 48 cent higher with october at 
7010 cents a pound feeder cattle were 50 cent lower to 05 cent 
higher with september at 7915 cents a pound hogs were 15 cent to 
68 cent higher with october at 3840 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 08 cent to 123 cents higher with february at 4750

after learning from japan about modern 
furnaces enlightened labor relations and customer service 
american steelmakers are once again looking across the pacific 
ocean this time for a steel process that may help protect us 
warships at sea and tanks on land 
highstrength lowalloy steel plate easier to weld less 
dependent on hardtoget alloying elements and potentially cheaper 
to make is the latest fruit of the japanese industrial system 
its the wave of the future said charles null head of the 
metals branch of the us navys sea systems command 
american steelmakers lag japan by 10 to 15 years in the 
computercontrolled processing needed to make the supertough 
steel but the navy is anxious to catch up 
the navy wants to build ships out of worldclass steel they 
want the best that money can buy and theyre willing to pay for 
it said harry i mchenry a steel specialist for the national 
institute of standards and technology formerly the national bureau 
of standards 
but right now the american steel plate producers dont have 
all the technical tools available to them mchenry said in a 
telephone interview from his boulder colo office 
besides the navys support the army is interested in the new 
plate for its armored vehicles the material has applications in 
commercial shipping as well 
the defense department hopes to win its request for 55 million 
in the 1989 defense budget to send american steel to japan for 
processing and to bring it back for testing if the plate meets 
specifications and congress appropriates more money the department 
would negotiate with domestic steel companies for one of them to 
upgrade a plate mill with the new technology in exchange for 
guaranteed sales 
were very excited about this project i think it has a great 
deal of potential for the us steel industry said michael 
corridore a pentagon industrial specialist who heads the program 
mchenry said the reasons american steelmakers lag the japanese 
in this area are intertwined with the forces that helped undermine 
americas postwar industrial power japan steelmakers invested 
early on in research that led to computerized processing the key 
to more precise manipulating of steels metallurgical properties as 
the metal is heated cooled squeezed and stretched 
by 1983 japans five major plate makers were using controlled 
cooling which helps reduce the need for alloying steel with 
niobium molybdenum and other elements that make the finished 
plates tricky to weld 
its the heart of the technology the pentagon is willing to pay 
american steelmakers to adopt it is a followup technology to 
controlled rolling which the japanese commercialized in the late 
1960s america adopted that in the 1980s mchenry said 
i dont think the industry is being stubborn or hardheaded or 
ignorant by not adopting this technology mchenry said the 
technology is not that attractive from a commercial standpoint 
were not stupid in this country despite what you read said 
marshal mazur manager of government programs for bethlehem steel 
corp a leading plate maker weve been aware of this technology 
for a long time but were a free market economy and we dont 
always have access to all the capital that you need to invest in 
technology 
that situation hasnt always presented itself to our trading 
partners so its real easy for the japanese with easy access to 
capital to go down their wish list and made a decision to 
proceed mazur said 
without government underwriting theres no way you can 
justify putting these units in said anthony de ardo director of 
the basic metals processing research institute at the university of 
pittsburgh 
de ardo however is not a fan of the new japanese technology 
and thinks the pentagon should be looking to us labs for help 
i think the pentagon has been sold a bill of goods on this 
he said but i give them the benefit of the doubt they really 
believe theyre doing something thats correct 
de ardo said japanese steelmakers have shown the benefits of 
accelerated cooling to much of our military and theres no 
question that what theyre saying is true its just that i think 
our steel industry needs many things to benefit the military before 
they get to an accelerated cooling unit 
controlled cooling also called accelerated cooling involves 
computers calculating exactly when to spray water on a hot plate as 
it emerges in its final shape from a rolling mill 
but its not that simple said mchenry who recommended 
highstrength lowalloy steel to the navy after studying the new 
process for a year in japan 
the computer controls when the cooling starts and when the 
cooling stops what the volume of water is what the distribution 
of water is from side to side and what the rate of travel of the 
plate through this shower is he said 
the japanese coupled that technique to direct rolling in which 
molten steel is cast into 8inch thick slabs then rolled directly 
into plate an inch or so thick 
the method eliminates the time and energyconsuming steps of 
cooling the slabs to room temperature to be inspected cleaned of 
surface defects and reheated it is possible only with steel of 
precise and consistent composition itself a benefit of 
computercontrolled furnaces 
together those processes allow for reductions in alloying 
elements including chromium and vanadium which the soviet union 
and south africa control 
japan developed the processes to supply to its busy fabricators 
who produce offshore drilling platforms and transcontinental 
pipelines

stock prices moved higher tuesday as the market 
was buoyed by developments in the oil sector 
confidence was given a much needed boost by british gas plc 
which staged a dawn raid scooping up shares in london and 
scottish marine oil co known as lasmo 
the financial timesstock exchange 100stock index closed up 
117 points or 07 percent at 17563 
trading volume was 3692 million shares compared with 2132 
million shares traded during mondays session 
although british gas failed to achieve its target of aquiring a 
149percent stake in lasmo the hectic buying and the general 
speculation surrounding the raid helped the whole oil sector and 
share prices generally 
you can see what happens to this market when theres a little 
bit of good news said roger charlesworth senior dealer at chase 
manhattan securities ltd in london 
the market has lately been plagued by confusion over the 
nearterm direction for equities and by particularly low levels of 
participation 
the raid on lasmo started before the official market opening 
with the brokerage hoare govett ltd offering to purchase lasmo 
shares on behalf of british gas at 480 pence or 816 apiece 
well above mondays closing lasmo price of 390 pence 
hoare govett said it obtained a small amount of lasmos stock 
the raid sparked speculation of a forthcoming takeover bid for 
lasmo 
takeover speculation also surrounded enterprise oil plc another 
independent british oil company because of lasmos 25 percent 
holding in enterprise 
a successful bidder for lasmo could use the enterprise holding 
as a platform for a bid for enterprise as well analysts said 
lasmo shares surged to close at 543 pence a jump of 153 pence 
enterprise closed 126 pence higher at 562 pence

ken oshman and other former executives 
of rolm corp now at ultra network technologies are introducing a 
product oshman says will revolutionize the world of highspeed 
computer networks 
it is in a real sense uncharted waters oshman ultras 
chairman said monday of the new network being unveiled next 
tuesday 
ultras system which already has won endorsements from several 
makers of a new generation of socalled minisupercomputers is 
essentially a local area network that passes information among 
computers at a theoretical maximum rate of 1 billion bits per 
second 
ultra can transfer the contents of an encyclopedia in a few 
seconds 100 times faster than one widely used network for office 
computers 
supercomputers need faster local area networks because computer 
speed has outpaced the ability of the machines to transfer 
information 
ultra has basically found a very fast way of allowing 
highperformance computers to talk to each other said richard 
shaffer editor of technologic computer letter in new york it is 
hot stuff 
several makers of highspeed computers have agreed to market the 
network and connect their machines to the system

executives of river barge companies say this 
summers drought stalled their efforts to recover from some lean 
years 
after a severe recession in the early 1980s when some barge 
lines merged and others went broke the companies saw 1988 as the 
year to cap a comeback but they have been unpleasantly surprised 
by mounting losses 
finally this year people began to make money until mother 
nature gave us a lousy deal jeffrey smith vice president of the 
trade group american waterways operators said monday 
a study commissioned by the trade group projected the industry 
this year will suffer losses of as much as 200 million on revenue 
of 1 billion smith said operating costs of barge companies have 
soared while many of the rates are fixed by longterm contracts 
officials said 
the barge industry struggled as a whole from 1982 to 1986 when 
an oversupply of barges depressed hauling rates congress had 
proposed several bills that would help the industry by tax 
deferrals or direct subsidies but in august the industry announced 
it wanted no help smith said 
commercial traffic on the damregulated ohio river has continued 
without a hitch despite the summer drought but shallow water in 
the lower mississippi river has tied up barges and 7000aday 
towboats travel time for barges has doubled this summer 
in addition special drought restrictions reduced by half the 
number of barges that are allowed to be lashed together requiring 
barge companies to use more tow boats the restrictions also limit 
the load each barge can carry 
a turnaround year turned into a real dumper said morris 
larson executive vice president of the merchants exchange of st 
louis where the price of barge transportation for grain is 
determined in trade 
slower travel and the smaller loads caused a shortage of barges 
and boats this summer said richard a hain executive vice 
president of mg transport services inc a cincinnati barge 
company 
it was difficult to quote prices because there werent any 
barges available he said 
he said there was a substantial decline in company profits this 
summer 
at midland enterprises inc another cincinnatibased line 
profits will be down although the company will still make money 
said steve frasher vice president of operations 
this drought was not needed at this time frasher said

crop futures prices closed mostly higher tuesday 
on the chicago board of trade as strength from the buoyant wheat 
market spilled over into the corn and soybean pits 
corn and soybean futures had opened lower in reaction to the 
agriculture departments higherthanexpected harvest estimates 
issued after the close of trading on monday 
the report estimated 1988 us corn production at 446 billion 
bushels and soybean production at 147 billion bushels the numbers 
represent sharp declines from last years production levels because 
of drought damage but were still above most private forecasts 
the usdas wheatproduction estimate also was higher than 
expected but wheat futures prices rallied on the reports 
predictions of declining soviet and canadian wheat production and 
increasing soviet grain imports 
tuesdays market performance is a reflection of the fact that 
while everyone was focused on the disappointing numbers put out by 
usda domestically the world numbers for wheat came out friendly 
said ted mao grain specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in 
new york 
with potential cropweather problems developing in south america 
and severe crop losses a hard fact in the united states and canada 
the world situation is still tight for wheat mao said 
at the close wheat was 3 cents to 9 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 411 a bushel corn was 1 
cent lower to 2 cents higher with september at 285 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 3 cents higher with september at 264 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 8 cents higher with september at 
876 a bushel

the stock market finished higher in mostly 
sluggish trading today getting a lastminute boost from remarks by 
treasury secretary designate nicholas f brady 
the statements touched off a late buying wave after stocks 
traded slightly lower through most of the session 
brady an investment banker nominated by president reagan to 
replace former treasury chief james baker said at his senate

nine personal computer makers declared their 
independence from international business machines corp on tuesday 
with a new standard for how information will be passed around 
inside their machines 
analysts said the announcement of the new bus or data 
pathway killed for good the lingering idea that ibm would control 
the standards for the next generation of personal computers 
its ibm and the rest of us said william krause chairman 
and chief executive of 3com corp which makes communications 
software for machines made by both ibm and its rivals 
in an unusually busy day for the computer industry there were 
these other important developments 
the new york times reported that ibm would link up with a 
former nemesis steven p jobs the cofounder of apple computer 
inc it said ibm will spend 10 million for a license to use 
technology developed by jobs new company next inc 
ibm announced a way for its most advanced personal computers to 
run the huge library of programs written for its system 36 
minicomputers it also introduced three improved models of its 9370 
minicomputers and two fast but inexpensive members of its personal 
system2 family 
digital equipment corp opened its annual dec world show in 
cannes france by unveiling plans to expand its business of 
helping companies plan and manage their computer and communications 
systems at the same time it announced a way to monitor and manage 
an entire farflung computer network from a single point 
computer associates international inc of garden city ny 
the worlds largest independent software company announced 
agreement on a 170 million purchase of applied research inc of 
princeton nj from ameritech the chicagobased telephone 
holding company 
the nine companies that gathered for a new york news conference 
have agreed on standards for a bus which specifies the way 
information is passed between the processor keyboard screen 
memory and other components 
the capabilities of the new bus which had been kept secret 
exceeded the expectations of many industry watchers the companies 
said it will outperform ibms micro channel in several respects 
including the speed at which it can handle bursts of data 
tuesdays announcement was important because it helped set 
standards that will last into the 1990s when advanced personal 
computers will be as fast as todays fastest mainframe computers 
this is a great day for the industry said mark d stahlman 
an analyst for sanford c bernstein amp co ibms micro channel is 
now just one of a number of alternatives 
it appears that there will be three main competitors in coming 
years the micro channel inside advanced models of ibms personal 
system2 the nubus inside advanced models of apple computer incs 
macintosh and the bus announced tuesday eisa for extended 
industry standard architecture 
although houstons compaq computer corp is believed to have 
been a main instigator of the project it played down its role 
it just gained momentum i dont think you can single out any 
one or even a few companies said ron canion president and chief 
executive of compaq which soared into the fortune 500 in record 
time by successfully challenging ibm in personal computers 
computers built on the new bus will not be available until the 
second half of 1989 that gives ibm time to convince customers that 
if they want a more powerful bus they should buy an ibm personal 
system2 which is already on the market 
my question is if youre going to buy a machine today 
wouldnt you want to buy a machine that has those advanced 
capabilities today said bill lyons ibms vice president for 
software marketing 
for buyers of personal computers the differences between the 
personal system2 and the competitors machines will be hard to 
detect especially within the next few years 
canion estimated that 98 percent of programs developed for one 
kind of computer would run on the others without modification the 
main exception would be communications software 
the nine companies agreed to share any patents on the new bus 
among themselves and offer free licenses to any other companies 
that want to use it the only charge to companies will be 2500 to 
cover paperwork and lawyers fees 
the other eight originators of the standard are tandy corp 
zenith data systems ast research incwyse technology 
hewlettpackard co italys ing c olivetti amp co spa and 
japans nec information systems inc and epson america inc 
other major contributors to the project are intel corp and 
microsoft corp which are also major suppliers to ibm of chips 
and software respectively 
ben rosen the venture capitalist and chairman of compaq said 
the coalition of so many rivals was unprecedented its one of 
the major events in the history of the pc industry he said

currency market strategists said the dollar may have received a 
slight boost from comments on the nations trade deficit by 
investment banker nicholas brady at senate hearings on his 
nomination to be treasury secretary 
bradys allusions to the narrowing deficit were interpreted by 
some traders as a sign that the reagan administration was not 
overly concerned with the dollars current level which took some 
selling pressure off the currency 
nevertheless the level of trading remained sluggish due to the 
unpredictable market impact of the trade deficit statistics to be 
released wednesday morning 
the consensus in the currency market is for a deficit of about 
115 billion vs 1254 billion for june but the trade data are 
one of the most difficult statistics to predict 
people are very reluctant to do much ahead of that number 
said james chorek a currency analyst at money market services a 
chicago investment and financial information concern 
in tokyo the dollar closed at 13307 japanese yen down from 
13342 yen monday but later in london the dollar rebounded to 
13330 yen and by the time trading ended in new york the dollar 
strengthened to 13337 yen up slightly from 13335 yen monday

expensive than 16958 late monday in new york the pound weakened

former apple computer inc chairman 
steven p jobs has achieved a coup by reportedly enlisting 
international business machines corp to back next incs 
longawaited new computer analysts say 
next has closely guarded the details of the computer which has 
been three years in the making and is scheduled to be unveiled oct 
12 after repeated delays 
the new york times reported tuesday that ibm is paying 10 
million for the right to use the symbols and commands with which 
the user will interact with jobs new computer 
industry executives said ibm plans to use the jobs technology 
which controls the look and feel of the machines on computers 
that run the unix operating system 
jobs has said the next computer was initially designed for 
college students and academic researchers although analysts said 
they now believe he envisions a wider market for the computer 
analysts noted that jobs faces a much tougher environment for 
startups than when he founded apple in nearby cupertino more than 
11 years ago ibm and apple have set high computer standards and 
those two companies and sun microsystems inc have successfully 
wooed the specialized academic market for years 
hes got to have something that really sets it apart 
something that lights a fire william lampesis of dataquest inc 
in san jose said monday 
for years ibm was the major rival of jobs in efforts to 
dominate of the personal computer industry while jobs headed apple 
when he lost a bitter battle three years ago with apple 
president john sculley and was ousted from the company jobs set 
out to invent a new personal computer as significant as the apple 
macintosh 
the yetunnamed next computer is expected to have a number of 
features not available on current personal computers such as a 
highspeed facsimile modem powerful digital sound processing 
capabilities an erasable compact disc player for data storage and 
retrieval and the ability to display televisionquality video 
signals 
jobs may face legal obstacles in his effort to establish his new 
machine on the market apple sued jobs in 1985 and as part of a 
settlement won the right to inspect the next machine for possible 
trade secret violations apple says jobs has given only partial 
compliance 
we still reserve the right for further evaluation of the 
product said apple spokeswoman carleen levasseur 
cathy cook nexts spokeswoman expressed surprise at apples 
claim saying she believed apple had signed off on the machine 
as far as next is concerned theyve fulfilled everything they 
have to do cook said 
but jobs strong credibility in the industry and the ibm 
connection make experts reluctant to say he cant clear the hurdles 
ahead of him 
steve is steve whatever he does is of great interest to 
people said katie povejsil academic solutions manager at apple 
at universities she said i get the impression there is a 
real waitandsee attitude theyve been promised a lot and theyd 
like to see the goods

cotton futures prices soared tuesday on the new york cotton 
exchange on fears that heavy rains from hurricane gilbert could 
damage the cotton crop in central and western texas 
on other markets prices for future delivery of oil and oil 
products grains soybeans copper gold silver and livestock all 
finished higher stockindex futures also advanced 
gilbert was heading toward mexicos yucatan peninsula on tuesday 
after devastating jamaica and the dominican republic some cotton 
traders feared that strong winds and rain from the savage storm 
would reach deep into texas 
they know it will go into the gulf of mexico tomorrow and move 
into the south texas coastal areas said ernest simon cotton 
specialist with prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
simon said traders feared the storm would strike land between 
tampico mexico and corpus christi texas turn north and pour rain 
on cotton fields in the states central and western portions 
if that happens he said it will lower the grade it may even 
cause some loss 
despite the heavy buying prompted by gilberts approach simon 
said the loss of even 500000 bales of cotton would have little 
impact on the glutted cotton market 
earlier this week the agriculture department estimated that 
stocks of cotton next july 31 the end of the current marketing 
year would total 82 million bales compared with 56 million bales 
at the end of the 198788 year 
if this storm does something it is meaningless in the overall 
context of the cotton crop we have said simon we still have a 
huge surplus of cotton 
cotton settled 124 cents to 155 cents higher with the contract 
for delivery in october at 5549 cents a pound 
fears that gilbert could force a temporary halt to gasoline 
production at oil refineries in the gulf helped spur energy futures 
to higher levels on the new york mercantile exchange analysts said

increasing soviet grain imports analysts said

5125 in nationwide trading of issues listed on the new york stock 
exchange 
a federal trade commission ruling on friday allowed the hafts to 
acquire at least 15 million worth of kroger stock the hafts who 
control dart group corp of landover md are corporate takeover 
strategists and have unsuccessfully chased other supermarket chains 
but made huge profits in the process 
this restructuring is not specifically tailored to the haft 
situation kroger spokesman paul bernish said we take it 
seriously but ever since the market became competitive in 1985 or 
1986 weve been pretty vigilant about this we want to keep kroger 
an independent and public company 
kroger said the restructuring would involve substantial but 
unspecified bank loans paying shareholders 48 in cash and 
securities per share and allowing them to keep their stock kroger 
has about 7857 million shares outstanding 
kroger said it will repay the loans using cash flow from 
operations reducing expenses and selling assets in a 1986 
restructuring kroger sold its chain of superx retail drugstores 
and kroger has worked since july to sell off its unprofitable chain 
of florida choice supermarkets and liquor stores in florida 
this is a case of extending that process bernish said 
our review of assets will be heightened if this plan is 
approved 
the ftc ruling was the first official sign of the hafts 
interest in kroger representatives of the hafts declined to 
comment 
supermarket industry analysts said the restructuring plan was a 
positive step for kroger 
this has been an option for kroger for a long time it is not 
necessarily a response to the haft announcement but the haft 
family move was a catalyst said elizabeth shiels analyst for 
the investment firm hilliard lyons in louisville ky 
kroger has been looking for ways to reward its stockholders 
she said this restructuring allows the company to stay public 
this is a prudent move for kroger 
krogers stock has traded heavily over the past five months 
partly because of rumors the hafts and other potential acquirers 
were interested in the company 
if the hafts were to take over kroger its almost certain 
that theyll start dismantling the company and selling off its 
assets said gary m giblen vice president at rotanmosle a 
houstonbased investment firm 
but giblen also said the hafts may be serious about running a 
grocery company 
they demonstrated that earlier this spring when they bought a 
small washington dc grocery chain instead of selling it off 
for the cash the hafts are using the company to learn how to 
manage a grocery firm giblen said 
the hafts have failed in their efforts to buy such companies as 
safeway stores inc supermarkets general corp and stop amp shop 
cos but have profited in selling stock back to those companies

peace in britains twoweek post office strike 
appeared in the balance tuesday night as thousands of workers 
stayed off the job despite mondays settlement of the dispute 
it was still impossible to post a letter in london where mail 
boxes remained sealed 
the post office said work had begun on clearing 150 million 
letters and packages backed up in the system although it expected 
a full return to work by thursday the post office said it could be 
two weeks before service was restored to normal 
as night shifts began it estimated that 20000 of the 100000 
strikers had returned to work it said another 40000 worked during 
the strike 
tuffin general secretary of the union of communication workers 
said agreement was reached monday on the issue of regional pay 
bonuses but the key issue of whether union members would allow 
casual workers to handle the mail backlog had been left to local 
negotiations 
he said the union would back members remaining on strike if they 
could not agree terms on casual labor and overtime with post office 
local managers 
the union said half the countrys 15000 sorting offices were 
still on strike and only six of the 82 major sorting centers were 
working it said staff at glasgow york and hull had voted to stay 
out and similar decisions were expected at other offices 
the strike began as a 24hour walkout on aug 31 against the 
post office desire to pay bonuses to new workers in london and 
southeast england where the cost of living is high and retaining 
workers difficult the union wanted the bonuses paid nationally 
strikes mushroomed sept 1 when the post office tried to bring 
in workers to clear the mail backlog 
tuffin said monday the bonus system had been accepted until a 
new one could be worked out in about six weeks

the deficit in the broadest measure of us 
trade narrowed sharply from april through june as overseas sales of 
american merchandise surged to a record high the government 
reported tuesday 
however the good news was tempered by the fact that america 
suffered its first deficit in three decades in the trade category 
which includes investment earnings 
the commerce department said the deficit in the current account 
shrank to 333 billion in the second quarter a 98 percent 
improvement from a first quarter imbalance of 369 billion it was 
the biggest quarterly improvement since a 201 percent drop in the 
final three months of last year 
the current account is the most important of all the 
governments trade statistics because it covers not only trade in 
merchandise but also trade in services which primarily reflect the 
flow of investment earnings between countries 
the improvement in the second quarter current account deficit 
occurred because the deficit in merchandise trade fell to 299 
billion down from 352 billion in the first quarter as exports 
rose to a record level and imports posted the first quarterly 
decline in three years 
this improvement was offset by a 492 million imbalance in 
services which meant that foreigners earned more on their 
investments during the quarter than americans earned on overseas 
investments 
also adding to the current account deficit was 29 billion in 
us payments for foreign aid and pensions to americans living 
overseas 
for the first six months of this year the current account 
deficit has been running at an annual rate of 1405 billion a 
substantial improvement from a record deficit of 154 billion in 
1987 
the improvement has come about because of a boom in us 
exports reflecting declines in the value of the dollar since 1985 
which have made american goods competitive once again on overseas 
markets 
the export rebound has translated into hefty job gains in 
american manufacturing which the reagan administration hopes will 
benefit republican george bushs presidential chances 
however democrat michael dukakis has charged that the surge in 
trade deficits this decade and the resulting growth in foreign debt 
is one of the major failures of the reagan economic program 
the current account was last in surplus in 1981 a year in which 
americans earnings on overseas investments were enough to offset a 
deficit in merchandise trade 
since that time americans have handed over billions of dollars 
to foreigners in exchange for imported goods transforming the 
country from the worlds largest creditor nation to the worlds 
largest debtor country 
that means that foreigners now own more in us investments than 
americans hold in foreign investments 
this transfer of wealth was reflected in the second quarter 
deficit in the services category the first deficit in this 
category since 1958 
the services deficit is small enough that it could be revised 
away in future reports three months ago the government said that 
the services category posted a deficit of 655 million in the first 
quarter that was revised in tuesdays report to show a surplus of 
14 billion 
but economists said the trend is clear with foreign holdings in 
the united states rising rapidly the investment category will soon 
turn negative and will stay in the red for some time 
the congressional joint economic committee held a hearing on the 
trade deficits tuesday and heard a panel of economists urge further 
action to cut federal budget deficits as a way of slowing us 
domestic demand and further reducing the trade deficit 
the current account deficit is directly linked to the growth of 
foreign ownership of us assets because it shows how much we have 
borrowed from abroad to finance our trade deficit 
at the end of 1987 americas net debtor position stood at 
3682 billion 
nigel gault senior economist at data resources inc told the 
committee that he estimates americas foreign debt burden will top 
500 billion this year and will approach 2 trillion by the year 
1995 
economists have warned that as more and more money is 
transferred into foreign hands to service americas debt it will 
mean a lower standard of living for americans 
our foreign debt is growing at the rate of approximately 
200000 per minute said sen paul sarbanes dmd and chairman 
of the economic committee our status as a debtor nation has 
profound implications for the domestic economy it affects 
employment prospects the financial markets the value of the 
dollar and vital sectors of the economy such as housing which 
depend on longterm credit 
the administration however has played down the significance of 
the record increase in foreign investment in this country 
contending the debt servicing is still a tiny fraction of the 
countrys overall gross national product 
the government will release wednesday a report on the 
merchandise trade deficit for july with many economists predicting 
that the imbalance will decline slightly to 115 billion down 1 
billion from the june deficit

stocks got a boost from predictions that the trade deficit would 
continue to decline

also trade in services which primarily reflect the flow of 
investment earnings between countries 
on wednesday the government will report the merchandise trade 
balance for july a monthly figure watched closely by the financial 
markets 
the dow jones industrial average spurted ahead in late trading 
tuesday encouraged by remarks from treasury secretary designate 
nicholas f brady who said at his senate confirmation hearing that 
he expects the trade deficit to decline at a surprisingly fast pace 
over the next few years 
the dow jones average of 30 bluechip stocks ended 1067 points 
higher at 208304 after a mostly lackluster session 
brady an investment banker who investigated the causes of last 
years stock market crash was nominated by president reagan to 
replace former treasury chief james a baker iii 
in other markets the dollar strengthened slightly but activity 
was slow in advance of the july trade figures bond prices gained 
as the yield on the governments 30year issue slipped below 9 
percent 
oil prices advanced driven by a rise in wholesale gasoline 
prices which soared on news that refineries and oil platforms were 
threatened by a hurricane approaching the gulf of mexico the 
contract for october delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude rose 7 cents to settle at 1456 a 
42gallon barrel on the new york mercantile exchange wholesale 
unleaded gasoline for october delivery closed up 119 cents at

of an 875 million jury award to a minnesota woman in her suit 
against gd searle amp co manufacturer of the copper7 
intrauterine device that she said left her sterile 
judge robert renner however lowered the emotional distress 
award given esther kociemba from 1 million to 400000 based on 
state law limiting recovery for intangible losses including 
emotional distress to 400000 
renner said the damage awards for pain and suffering and 
punitive damages would remain 
the jury of five women and three men returned the verdict last 
friday after 10 days of deliberations that began after a 14week 
trial they awarded mrs kociemba 30 of elk river 7 million in 
punitive damages 1 million for emotional distress and 750000 
for pain and disability 
the jury found the birth control device was not properly tested 
and that illinoisbased searle a subsidiary of monsanto co 
failed to warn about risks and intentionally misrepresented the 
copper7 
but the jury also found that searle was not negligent in the 
design or manufacture of the copper7 
renner could have declared that the jurys decision was improper 
and declare a mistrial 
kay bruno a spokeswoman at searle headquarters in skokie ill 
said company attorneys were preparing briefs to be submitted oct 4 
on a motion to dismiss the verdict and request a new trial

million to 2 million in compensatory damages and 300000 in 
compensatory damages for her husband william the jury declined to 
award william kociemba any money for loss of consortium as a direct 
result of his wifes use of the copper7 
some 500 lawsuits have been filed over the copper7 once the 
most widely used iud in the united states before it was withdrawn 
from the us market in january 1986 
searle won 14 of the previous 17 cases to be decided but 
kociemba lawyers have said that none of the previous cases included 
as many documents or deposition testimony as this one 
mrs kociemba used a copper7 for just under 1 years in 1977 
and 1978 she claimed the iud triggered a pelvic infection two 
weeks after insertion and that the infection scarred her fallopian

ecuador plans to seek an increase in its 
opec production quota energy minister diego tamariz said tuesday 
noting that government budget plans did not account for the recent 
decline in world oil prices 
tamariz said the average price ecuador gets for its oil has been 
ranging between 1188 and ll55 a barrel while the governments 
budget was calculated on an estimate of 17 a barrel 
there is a certain weakness in the petroleum market that has 
accentuated in recent days with a declining tendency tamariz 
said in a news conference 
ecuador is one of the smallest producers among the 13 members of 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries although oil 
provides more than half of its export earnings 
the energy minister said ecuador planned to ask opec to increase 
its production quota from 210000 barrels daily to between 300000 
and 310000 barrels 
ecuador currently produces 310000 barrels a day with special 
permission from opec which ends this month opec approved the 
temporary increase in ecuadors production after the country 
suffered devastating economic damage from earthquakes in march 1987 
tamariz said the market was unstable because of peace 
negotiations between iran and iraq which are among the worlds 
major oil producers 
overall opec production in august was estimated at 20 million 
barrels a day nearly 35 million barrels over its selfimposed 
output ceiling the world oil glut plus speculation that the 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war could bring even higher production 
has helped depress prices below opecs benchmark of 18 a barrel 
in addition to ecuador the united arab emirates is seeking a 
higher quota the uae has refused to accept a quota of 948000 
barrels a day and demanded a 15 millionbarrel quota roughly the 
level of its current production

a defendant utility in the washington 
public power supply system fraud trial settled its share of the 
case for 65 million in an agreement announced late tuesday the 
day before opening arguments were set to begin in federal court 
the settlement by washingtons clallam county public utility 
district left 19 other defendants including 16 utilities to stand 
trial in the fraud suit stemming from the biggest municipal bond 
default ever 
settlements so far total more than 353 million and have 
included more than 70 utilities and wall street firms that handled 
wppss bond sales plaintiffs also have assumed rights to disputed 
insurance claims that could yield another 92 million 
opening trial statements were expected to last through thursday 
the first witness is expected to take the stand monday 
bondholders originally sued more than 100 parties in the case 
which grew out of wppss 1983 default on 225 billion worth of 
bonds sold to finance construction on two neverfinished nuclear 
power plants wppss nos 4 and 5 
the defendants have denied the claims of fraud arguing that 
poor judgment may have been a factor but wppss and defendant 
utilities acted in what they believed were the best interests of 
the northwests energy needs 
in addition to the 16 utilities which were both wppss board 
members and participants in building plants 4 and 5 remaining 
defendants include two engineering firms and a financial adviser to 
the supply system 
mel weiss an attorney for plaintiff wppss bond buyers said 
clallam county pud would pay 6 million cash and another 521750 
would come from its insuror clallam pud commissioners still must 
formally approve the settlement weiss said 
officials of the port angeles washbased utility were not 
immediately available for comment 
this is a significant settlement in that its a first with a 
member thats basically uninsured said weiss 
it shows the utilities can raise significant amounts of money 
without insurance he said 
the clallam pud settlement also could indicate what the entire 
wppss suit might be settled for weiss said clallam pud paid 475 
million per percentage point of its 14 percent interest in two 
wppss nuclear plants 
the 16 remaining utilities contracted for about 63 percent of 
the plants expected output so a final settlement could total 
about 300 million 
settlement talks have been conducted in secrecy so it is 
unknown which defendants are negotiating
