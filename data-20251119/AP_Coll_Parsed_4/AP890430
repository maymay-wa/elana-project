in true urban cowboy fashion police 
officers in the west are taking to the streets on mountain bikes to 
combat crime 
weve found bikes to be quite the urban crime fighter 
said officer paul grady 
grady and his partner pete rossen pioneered the use of bikes 
two years ago as of june 1 grady said 20 seattle officers will be 
on twowheelers rather than behind the wheel of a patrol car 
you see criminals at the end of an alley and they disappear 
before you can always get to them we thought of using bikes when 
it seemed there just had to be a way to get at them faster grady 
said and on a bike criminals dont know when or where you might 
appear on your beat 
others apparently agree police departments in los angeles san 
diego palo alto calif fort worth texas olympia wash and 
victoria british columbia have started their own bike detachments 
seattles bikers wear a modified police uniform including 
uniform pants made into bike shorts with a padded seat a helmet 
bike gloves a nylon gunbelt and protective glasses grady said 
the idea is a moneysaver the startup cost is about 1000 per 
officer and equipping seattles 20man unit cost less than two 
squad cars he said 
only one serious injury has occurred so far one officer broke a 
leg during a fight with a felon when he was knocked over his parked 
bike grady said 
lt paul wooten of the tacoma police said his department plans 
to put two officers on bikes in the downtown area later this month 
the officers will be able to ride up and down stairs over sky 
bridges and through parking garages boy when you see an officer 
coming at you on a bike you wont forget it said wooten

as far as members of the grand national 
waterfowl hunt club are concerned life really does imitate art 
the club has planned to erect an 80000 bronze sculpture 
geese in flight atop a 15foot obelisk on the banks of the 
choptank river 
but a pair of migrating osprey got there first the birds 
returned to their summer breeding habitat last month and found the 
perch to be an ideal nesting site for the past several days the 
pair has been carefully arranging branches twigs and weeds on top 
of the pedestal as if planning on a long stay 
if they decide to nest up there i dont know what will 
happen said john w tieder jr one of the organizers of the 
project 
sculptor george northnup had been expected to journey from his 
wyoming home in next few weeks to erect the sculpture tieder said 
the clubs problem is how to evict the unwanted guests and its 
plight isnt unique 
glenn therres of the maryland forest park and wildlife service 
said the agency has received numerous calls recently asking for 
advice on ospreys nesting on piers light poles and other 
inconvenient places 
if nest building has just gotten started we do authorize 
removal of nests therres said approval must come from the state 
or the federal fish and wildlife service though and nests cannot 
be removed after eggs have been laid he said

the dwarfs dragons and demigods who populate 
richard wagners ring cycle returned to the stage of the 
metropolitan opera last week true to the composers wishes for the 
first time in 50 years 
a standingroomonly crowd of nearly 4000 people paid up to 
620 to see the epic performed the way wagner wanted it all four 
operas totaling 17 hours of music unfolding in a single week 
not since the season of 193839 had the met done the ring right 
although the individual operas have been performed many times over 
the years 
the mets new production already reviled as reactionary by some 
critics as they watched it assembled over the last 2 years shuns 
the current vogue of squeezing wagners untidy mythmaking into a 
political economic or psychological mold 
instead the staging by otto schenk and sets and costumes by 
guenther schneidersiemssen are deliberately oldfashioned a 
throwback to productions that let the drama and music speak for 
themselves 
scenes and characters are just what they appear to be in this 
version of wagners tangled tale about the theft of a golden ring 
and the disasters that befall all who pursue it 
the rhinemaidens are really mermaids not prostitutes as in one 
production and their river is not a hydroelectric dam wotan is 
really the king of the gods not a 19th century capitalist 
siegfried is really a noble young warrior not a garage mechanic 
with no striking interpretation to hold the audiences interest 
the production might fall flat if the singing and orchestral 
playing were not on such a high level 
the orchestra sounded splendid all week and conductor james 
levine kept things moving with a keen sense of dramatic tension 
aside from a wobbly horn here or there and a rare sour note the 
sound was as close to perfection as any orchestra could produce 
hildegard behrens once again proved herself the finest wagnerian 
performer of her generation though she lacks the vocal power of a 
flagstad or a nilsson she makes up for that with dramatic 
intensity and she looks the part of a beautiful young valkyrie 
this was no case of the opera being over when the fat lady sings 
bass james morris was a superior wotan his brilliant high notes 
cutting through the heavy orchestration with ease another 
outstanding bass matti salminen carried off the rare feat of 
appearing in all four operas as fafner a giant in das 
rheingold but transformed into a dragon in siegfried as 
hunding in die walkuere and as hagen in goetterdaemmerung 
other singers who made memorable contributions to the week 
included franz mazura and graham clark as the brother dwarfs 
alberich and mime helga dernesch as wotans nagging wife fricka 
but not as waltraute in goetterdaemmrung where the high notes 
were too much for her siegfried jerusalem as the crafty god loge 
brigitta svenden as the prophetess erda and marianne haeggender 
unusually sweetsounding as the goddess freia 
as the romantic lovers siegmund and sieglinde robert schunk and 
ellen shade looked convincing and sang acceptably but were no vocal 
match for the team that appeared in earlier performances gary 
lakes and jessye norman 
a bigger problem was the siegfried of toni kraemer he acted 
fairly well but had to press his voice in the upper register and 
tired under the heavy demands of his role the world is still 
waiting for a true heldentenor who can do justice to this killer 
role 
the met is offering one more ring cycle this week with 
gwyneth jones as bruennhilde william johns as siegfried and hans 
sotin as wotan it will be back three more times next spring and 
will be televised on four consecutive nights in june 1990 by the 
public broadcasting service

the citys communist party chief promised student 
representatives sunday that some of those who have demonstrated for 
democratic reform will not be punished chinese official media 
reported 
it was the second day of meetings between students and officials 
in response to student demands for talks with the government on 
freedom of the press human rights and official corruption 
the students have pressed their demands during the past two 
weeks by holding the largest protest marches in 40 years of 
communist rule they also have boycotted classes for a week and 
activists from the nearby city of tianjin said students at two 
schools there have joined the boycott 
the official xinhua news agency reported sundays meeting but 
did not say if students were protesters or members of official 
student associations that most students now reject 
the students have set up their own student unions and insist 
that the government talk with them the government has said the new 
groups are illegal 
a meeting between student representatives and government 
officials also took place saturday but students said it 
accomplished nothing 
xinhua said sundays meeting was between 29 students from 16 
beijing colleges and municipal leaders including mayor chen xitong 
and party secretary li ximing 
it said a student asked whether students who are party members 
and who have taken part in the demonstrations and boycott of class 
will be punished li said they would not be xinhua reported 
li and chen acting on student demands both revealed their 
monthly incomes were about 80 or about 50 percent more than the 
average factory worker chen also denied he won his post through 
nepotism 
special privileges for officials and corruption have been key 
targets of the students since they began their protests april 15 
so far most of the protest activity has been limited to the 
capital although smaller marches have been reported in other 
cities tianjin is the only other city where a largescale class 
boycott has been reported 
a tianjin university activist said the boycott began april 24 
the same day as in beijing and that 90 percent of nankai students 
and 70 percent of tianjin university students were taking part 
he said about 10000 students marched peacefully friday in the 
port city 68 miles east of beijing to show support for beijing 
students who marched the previous day 
about 150000 students and ordinary citizens joined in the 
beijing march 
the mayor of tianjin li ruihuan is among officials who have 
been criticized by students in beijing for allegedly having gotten 
his job through nepotism li is the soninlaw of wan li the 
chairman of the national peoples congress 
a nankai university student said school officials were warning 
upperclassmen they will not be assigned good jobs if they boycott 
class 
beijing students meanwhile continued to denounce saturdays 
meeting with central government officials as inadequate the 
officials took a conciliatory tone but urged them to return to 
class 
it was regrettable said wang dan one of the leaders of 
beijing universitys new student association it wasnt a 
dialogue it was more like a news conference with the students 
playing reporters and asking questions 
the government is still cheating us read a student poster 
at the school continue boycotting to protest the governments 
insincere dialogue said another 
wang and other leaders said the boycott would continue at least 
through thursday the 70th anniversary of chinas first student 
prodemocracy movement the students have said they will hold 
another march then 
however some student leaders expressed fears they would be 
arrested before thursday in a government effort to head off further 
embarrassing marches

maj gen yitzhak 
mordechai a bullnecked outspoken veteran of three wars says 
israels army will outlast arabs in the daily street battles that 
have become a fixture of the palestinian uprising 
we will never become tired we will act as if the intefadeh is 
going to last for 100 years said mordechai the head of israels 
southern command it means the israeli army will carry out its 
mission with tenacity and sensitivity as long as it is ordered to 
do so by the government 
at least 112 palestinians have been killed in the gaza strip 
since the uprising or intefadeh began nearly 17 months ago 
against israeli rule of the territory and the west bank 
mordechai 44 believes the only lasting solution to the gaza 
strips chronic unrest is an international campaign to relocate the 
nearly 250000 palestinians who live in the crowded refugee camps 
that spawned the uprising 
until then mordechai is prepared to direct the battle against 
the squads of arab youths who throw stones at his cream landrover 
as it leads a convoy of jeeps through gaza city 
at a strategy session last week he placed his blackhandled 
45caliber automatic on the desk in front of him as he questioned 
two dozen field officers packed into a situation room 
should he close a school where students had rioted what about 
the mosques 
avi a studiouslooking major with wirerimmed glasses argued 
that classrooms should be kept open to encourage as normal a life 
as possible 
asaf a whitehaired veteran proposed closing the school for a 
month as punishment but he argued against shutting mosques saying 
it could inflame moslem fundamentalists israel doesnt want a holy 
war he said 
mordechai who allowed a reporter to attend the review on 
condition he not quote soldiers verbatim ended the debate with a 
lecture on the need to be sensitive during the holy month of 
ramadan when moslems fast from dawn to dusk 
the general recalled a recent threehour meeting with moslem 
elders in which israeli officers on his orders refrained from 
eating drinking or smoking in deference to the fast he said the 
elders praised the israelis for showing respect 
we should use the same respect with the mosques said 
mordechai who later demonstrated his fluency in arabic by stopping 
to chat with palestinian vegetable vendors and children on omar 
mukhtar street 
the army has temporarily cut off access to six of the 60 mosques 
in the gaza strip and indefinitely shut 15 of the 260 schools 
officers say the schools and mosques have become rallying points 
for the uprising 
more than 450 palestinians in the west bank and the gaza strip 
have been killed in the revolt 
by midapril according to army count soldiers had shot and 
killed 112 arabs and wounded 1500 in the gaza strip 
by un count 131 palestinians had been killed in the gaza 
strip and 18000 hurt 2659 by gunfire un officials said about 
onethird of the injured were children under 15 
the high number of casualties in an uprising in which soldiers 
often face rockthrowing youths has caused many israelis to 
question army tactics 
some reservists contend that service in the occupied lands is 
not what they have been trained for they have argued that daily 
confrontations with palestinian civilians have damaged troop morale 
mordechai in an interview over lunch at the gaza city jail 
bristled when asked why so many children were hurt he and other 
officers said activists invite serious injury by putting women and 
children in the midst of violent demonstrations 
we dont shoot children intentionally even with plastic 
bullets he said adding that children only got hurt when they 
stood behind adults and soldiers couldnt see them 
mordechai also said palestinian hospital officials padded 
casualty figures by taking names from telephone books on one 
recent day the army could only confirm eight to 10 wounded while 
arab reports said more than 50 were shot he said 
this is part of the battle to win public opinion to their 
side he said 
mordechai a paratroop officer who studied infantry tactics in 
england is a veteran field officer what israelis call a battle 
fox he commanded troops at the chinese farm in egypt one of 
the bloodiest encounters of the 1973 war 51 of his soldiers were 
killed and 100 were wounded 
he defended the jordan valley against palestinian crossborder 
raids in the 1960s and in 1982 led israeli troops in taking west 
beirut the former plo enclave 
mordechai stands in sharp contrast to his more liberal 
counterpart in the west bank maj gen amram mitzna who 
threatened to resign over israels conduct of the 1982 invasion of 
lebanon and who told reporters he had trouble sleeping at night 
because of the actions soldiers were sometimes forced to take in 
the west bank 
mordechai said the key was finding the right amount of force to 
use in a given situation in the uprising he said the army cannot 
use the large amount of firepower at its disposal without longterm 
repercussions 
we dont use 5 percent of our might he said we want to 
live in this part of the world with our neighbors when the 
uprising has ended

ralph e adams a world war ii submariner who 
helped rescue a downed flyer destined to become president of the 
united states has died at age 76 
adams died at his home of cancer on april 21 
he was part of a rescue party sent from the uss finback on sept 
4 1944 to pick up then lt jg george bush and four other downed 
navy airmen in a rubber raft bobbing about 70 miles off osaka 
japan 
i was one of the four men in our man overboard party that 
went for them adams said in a november 1988 interview i was 
in the party because i was the best swimmer 
bush who had been piloting a singleengine bomber that was shot 
down by the japanese and one of his crewmen were in the raft along 
with three other flyers from another downed plane 
i think that bush and the others were suprised that they were 
going to have to stay with us so long adams said i think they 
thought wed take them right back to their aircraft carrier or 
right to some american base but our orders were to stay at sea on 
lifeguard duty for another 30 days 
bush and the other survivors stayed aboard the finback until the 
submarine reached midway island around oct 15 1944 adams said

three or four b2 stealth bombers could 
have handled the 1986 libyan bombing raid better than the nearly 
100 planes that carried out the raid a highranking air force 
official said saturday 
were talking about an airplane that just gives us much more 
flexibility than anything right now in the strategic deterrent 
family said gen bernard s randolph commander of the air force 
systems command 
if the b2 had been in the air force arsenal three years ago 
three or four flying from the united states and refueling en route 
could have bombed libya with complete surprise more efficiency and 
accuracy than the europeanbased planes that did the job he said 
randolph addressed the annual news conference of the 
aviationspace writers association 
the bomber can carry up to 80 500pound conventional bombs or 20 
nuclear weapons can fly from low levels to altitudes of about 
50000 feet and personifies a technological leap into the next 
century he said 
the subsonic twoman aircraft will weigh more than 350000 
pounds with weapons and fuel and have a range of more than 6000 
nautical miles or more than 10000 with one refueling randolph 
said 
the range is greater than that of a b52 the mainstay of the 
nations bomber fleet for three decades he said the plane will be 
able to fly from any airfield that can handle a boeing 727 he said 
with two domestic and two overseas bases the united states will 
be able to attack any land mass in the world randolph said 
the b2 is scheduled to make its first flight this summer 
last week defense secretary richard cheney said the 
administration would delay purchasing the plane pending a review of 
the program which has been estimated to cost 70 billion for 132 
planes

the uss iowas no 1 gun turret had a 
misfire in one of its 16inch guns shortly before the battleships 
no 2 turret exploded on april 19 killing 47 sailors a survivor 
said 
petty officer kendall l truitt said the misfire occurred during 
gunnery exercises just before the blast ripped through the no 2 
turret the virginianpilot and the ledgerstar of norfolk reported 
in its sundays editions 
later after the explosion and firefighting attempts they 
still had bullets in turret ones gun truitt said 
the newspaper also reported that survivors said 12 sailors in 
the turret area survived the explosion the navy has said only 11 
men lived 
a navy official in norfolk who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said he couldnt comment on the report and in washington navy 
spokesman lt cmdr john marchi said he had not heard reports of a 
12th survivor 
capt fred p moosally has said there were no indications of any 
problems with the guns before the explosion 
the ships weapons control officer cmdr robert j kissinger 
said earlier this week the guns had passed a rigorous inspection 
that morning they had been fired last in early february he said 
the powder also had been inspected before the exercise

the only survivors in the guns area were those working at the 
bottom level of the turret in the nearby powder magazines and in a 
narrow hallway that ringed the armored turret 
mullahy was on the turrets internal communications system when 
the explosion occurred the newspaper reported unable to raise 
anyone on the upper decks of the sixdeck turret mullahy opened 
the blastproof door between the magazine and the hallway letting 
in the three men who were outside truitt said 
then mullahy opened the door to the powder flats an area on 
the turrets bottom level where powder is temporarily stored on its 
way up to the guns the newspaper reported 
there were no lights only a thick brown haze and a fire burning 
to the right the covers on several 110pound bags of powder were 
also burning the newspaper said mullahy told investigators 
mullahy quickly got out of the powder flats and left the 
magazine which truitt ordered evacuated locking the door behind 
him 
once outside the magazine truitt said mullahy threw emergency 
switches to flood the area 
moosally has said he ordered the magazines flooded seven minutes 
after the blast

jewish leaders are protesting plo leader yasser 
arafats visit to paris this week and calling for silent vigils to 
honor victims of terrorism 
the palestine liberation organization leader is to arrive 
tuesday morning for a twoday visit beginning with talks at the 
elysee palace with president francois mitterrand 
the representative council of jewish institutions appealed to 
the french to turn out in large numbers monday evening at jo 
goldenbergs restaurant in paris 
terrorists burst into the popular jewish restaurant in august 
1982 spraying machinegun bullets that killed six including two 
americans and injured 21 
vigils also were planned at the tati department store where a 
bomb hurled from a passing car killed seven people and injured 51 
in september 1986 and at the point show shopping gallery on the 
champs elysees the site of a terrorist bombing in march 1986 that 
killed two and injured 28 
the largest demonstration is expected tuesday in front of the 
copernic synagogue where in october 1980 a bomb killed four 
the attacks on goldenbergs restaurant and the copernic 
synagogue are believed to have been carried out by the abu nidal 
organization or another palestinian splinter group opposed to the 
plo the tati and point show bombings are thought to have been the 
work of proiranian lebanese terrorists 
theo klein head of the reprsentative council of jewish 
institutions said all victims of terrorism would be memorialized 
by the demonstrations including arab leaders who believed in an 
israelipalestinian dialogue and who were killed because of their 
views 
klein denounced the arafat visit 
im sorry no one has thought it useful to mention on the 
occasion of this visit that terrorism exists that the jewish 
community has been its target that the plo is responsible in part 
for the terrorism and that it is up to the jewish community to say 
so klein said in a statement 
klein said french jews find the visit especially offensive 
because it coincides with yom hashoah the day marking the nazi 
extermination of millions of jews 
on thursday mitterrand wrote to klein trying to ease the anger 
of the jewish community 
beyond the present circumstances france has not forgotten the 
victims of the shoah nor those of blind terrorism mitterrand 
wrote using the hebrew word for the holocaust 
this cruel and cowardly past is not erased from our memories 
as we conduct french foreign policy but it is founded on dialogue 
which makes it necessary to hear both sides to hear is not to 
approve 
while many jews say it is inappropriate for mitterrand to meet 
with arafat some have expressed hope it will further the cause of 
peace in the middle east 
arafat on wednesday is to meet with premier michel rocard and 
tour the louvre

the bush administration is drafting major 
changes to the nations premier jobtraining program aiming to 
provide more services to the unskilled poor by retargeting spending 
while also cutting the number of people served in favor of more 
thorough training 
the proposed changes to the job training partnership act also 
would take youthtraining programs now under jtpa and establish 
them as a separate entity that would drop its emphasis on summer 
training for a yearround approach both in schools and for 
dropouts according to department officials 
also recommended will be new oversight methods to insure 
cooperation at the state level between agencies that handle 
billions of dollars in training and related money distributed by 
the federal government each year primarily from the departments of 
labor education and health and human services 
the recommendations are included in legislation drafted by labor 
department officials a process essentially completed friday the 
legislation is to be reviewed by labor secretary elizabeth dole 
this week and then forwarded for white house review she hopes to 
unveil the proposals to congress in midmay 
right now a person cant go one place and get all the 
services mrs dole said in a recent interview its piecemeal 
its fragmented weve got to bring down this bureaucratic barrier 
the hardest thing to do is coordinate across government but 
were determined to do it 
the proposed changes address many of the criticisms directed at 
jtpa in a number of recent studies and reviews including one by 
the general accounting office and another by an advisory committee 
appointed to monitor the program established under legislation 
coauthored by vice president dan quayle 
jtpa is the most successful training program that weve ever 
had mrs dole said but i think we can make it much better 
mrs dole has met with education secretary lauro cavazos and hhs 
secretary dr louis sullivan to discuss the proposals they would 
involve expanded cooperation between jtpa and such ventures as the 
jobs programs included in last years welfare reform law and the 
nations vocational education system which is up for congressional 
reauthorization this year 
jtpa by far the largest of the federal governments training 
programs was allocated 24 billion for the current fiscal year 
and projected to serve 19 million people the bush administration 
has requested stable funding for next year 
a labor department official said he could not say how many fewer 
people would be served by jtpa if the changes are approved but said 
the reduction would be modest 
the two most significant changes would be rewriting the funding 
formula and separating the youth programs 
twothirds of jtpa money now is targeted based on unemployment 
rates while onethird goes to areas with concentrations of 
economically disadvantaged populations 
the new formula which still was being finetuned friday will 
substantially shift spending and have at least two thirds of 
jtpa funding targeted to the economically disadvantaged primarily 
those identified as lacking basic literacy and jobs skills the 
department official said 
because of funding restrictions jtpa now serves about 8 percent 
of those eligible for its services with state and local officials 
administering jtpafinanced programs generally given considerable 
leeway in selecting program participants from the pool of those 
eligible 
the proposed changes would refine the selection process to add 
individual skills assessments to better screen potential trainees 
for those most lacking skills 
too often im afraid were training people who can make it 
on their own mrs dole said 
also changed would be program guidelines that emphasize 
pertrainee cost and the rate of job placements those have been 
criticized for encouraging program directors to select trainees who 
already have marketable skills so they can be placed in jobs 
rapidly and for encouraging quick fix approaches that lead to 
placement in lowskills jobs that offer few career opportunities 
what were saying is its all right to spend more per person 
as long as we have longerterm outcomes training that leads to 
meaningful and lasting jobs said the department official 
improved targeting has been suggested by several recent reviews 
of jtpa including a gao report that said more than 40 percent of 
jtpa onthejob training money was being used to prepare workers 
for lowskills jobs such as dishwashers and custodians 
since taking office mrs dole has spoken frequently of improving 
training for youths a labor pool essential to hopes of heading off 
projected labor shortages particularly in highskills jobs 
young people who are prepared are needed she said there 
are plenty of jobs if you have the skills

the house and senate are set to move closer 
next week to enacting a deficitreduction package for fiscal 1990 
but lawmakers have shown again that it is still spending that 
drives many of congress decisions 
the senate plans to begin debate on tuesday on a 116 trillion 
spending plan and the house is scheduled to consider its 117 
trillion version the next day leaders of both chambers expect the 
measures to be approved and are hoping that a compromise plan can 
be completed by midmay 
the two packages each claim to whittle this years expected 
federal deficit of 163 billion to just above 99 billion for 1990 
using a recipe of spending cuts new revenues sunny economic 
assumptions and accounting gimmicks 
the outlines of the savings were drawn in a pact reached last 
month between president bush and congressional leaders of both 
parties an alliance that makes ultimate approval of the budget 
likely 
in other congressional activity a group of texas investors in a 
gas well venture have been subpoenaed to appear wednesday and 
thursday before the house ethics committee which is continuing its 
probe of the personal finances of house speaker jim wright dtexas 
the witnesses refused to speak to members of the panel last week 
when they tried to interview them in san antonio texas 
the house may vote on whether to impeach a us district judge 
from mississippi walter l nixon who is serving five years in 
prison for a perjury conviction nixon is hoping to return to the 
bench when his prison term is up 
congress budget votes next week will be greeted by lawmakers 
who will praise the deficitreduction plans as healthy first steps 
toward steeper budget cutting in the future but there is a 
contrast between those sentiments and some that were expressed in 
the house last week during congress first major budget vote of the 
year 
last wednesday the house rejected a plan by its democratic 
leaders that would have paid for a 47 billion spending bill for 
this year by slashing defense domestic and foreign aid programs 
some lawmakers voted against the measure because they said they 
wanted it cut down in size others however took to the floor to 
make it clear that they opposed the spending reductions it 
contained cuts that happened to affect programs they are connected 
to 
rep william natcher dky who chairs the appropriations 
health and education subcommittee warned if you take care of 
the health of your people and educate your children you can 
continue living in the strongest country in the world 
moments later rep beverly byron dmd told her colleagues 
that the cuts would have a devastating impact on our men and 
women in uniform byron chairs the armed services military 
personnel subcommittee 
house minority whip newt gingrich rga went even further 
saying the legislation basically says we can get to a balanced 
budget if only we abolish the defense department 
in the end the vote against the proposal was 252172 with 92 
democrats voting against their own leadership 
that vote was not an expression of deficit reduction 
mentality said rep bill schuette rmich a budget committee 
member who voted for the plan it was a coalition of people who 
didnt want further cuts in defense and people who didnt want 
other programs cut 
how is that sentiment likely to effect this weeks budget votes 
the conventional wisdom among many lawmakers is that if 
anything it will help the leaders obtain passage of the budget 
resolutions many domestic programs are slated for spending 
increases and the defense cuts have the endorsement of the bush 
administration 
thats not to say there wont be some rebellions rep gv 
sonny montgomery dala chairman of the house veterans affairs 
committee said friday he would lead a fight to seek 300 million 
more for veterans hospitals 
if they dont give us the money they shouldnt come around 
when the secretary says he has to close some units said 
montgomery who said he had not decided what he would do if he 
could not obtain the extra funds

a civil warera law allowing citizens to bring 
fraud suits against government contractors has produced a flood of 
new cases despite doubts about its costeffectiveness and its 
constitutionality 
the false claims act was first passed by congress in 1863 after 
union commanders found they had been cheated by munitions makers 
who sold them bullets filled with sawdust 
for 123 years citizens made little use of the socalled qui 
tam provisions legal shorthand for a longer latin phrase 
meaning who as well as for the king as for himself sues in this 
matter 
but in 1986 congress passed amendments giving citizens a 
financial incentive to come forward with allegations of wrongdoing 
citizens can share between 15 percent and 30 percent of the 
judgment if the government wins the case 
this law gave me the incentive to do what i should have done 
anyway said christopher urda a former bids administrator for a 
defense contractor who has brought one of the biggest suits to date 
the government recently decided to intervene and become the lead 
plaintiff in urdas 231 million suit charging that singer cos 
link flight simulation unit had fraudulently overcharged the 
government for flight simulator equipment for eight years 
in the last three years more than 140 cases have been filed in 
federal courts mostly against defense contractors 
after a case is filed under court seal the government has 60 
days to decide whether to intervene and take over the litigation 
so far the justice department has entered 20 cases and declined 
to join 60 others the rest remain under court seal pending justice 
department review 
department officials question whether the financial recoveries 
from the suits will be worth the time government lawyers must spend 
evaluating the complaints 
some lawyers in and out of the department have questioned the 
constitionality of allowing private citizens to bring civil cases 
on behalf of the government 
the justice department is now deciding whether to take a 
position on constitutional challenges to the law being mounted by 
defense contractors who were sued because the law was to little 
used until 1986 its constitutionality was never challenged 
previously in the courts 
the department declined to take a position on a case involving 
mcdonnell douglas corp now pending in federal court in los angeles 
but washington attorney richard sauber a former government 
prosecutor says the government is studying whether to support 
constitutional challenges he is mounting for northrop corp 
the law is unconstitutional sauber argues because it gives 
to private parties a law enforcement function and the right to sue 
on behalf of the united states 
continued use of the law by private plaintiffs means the 
government is going to be saddled with the lawyering and the 
legal strategy begun by private citizens he said 
if a private plaintiff loses a suit the government could be 
foreclosed from bringing a new case if it found better evidence of 
fraud he said 
what if they investigate it and decide not to come in 
sauber said the private people get a hold of it and muck it up 
but six months later they have new evidence 
the 1986 amendments were enacted by congress in the wake concern 
about waste in defense procurement including revelations that the 
pentagon had paid 600 for a toilet seat and 7400 for a coffee 
pot 
with major dollars going to the defense budget people wanted 
it to be properly spent said stuart e schiffer a deputy 
assistant attorney general who oversees the laws enforcement 
the amendment passed despite misgivings in the justice 
department about whether the longdormant law should be revived 
the department had a policy concern about whether or not it 
was really needed and surely it had constitutional dimensions 
that the attorney general should be in charge of bringing a suit to 
vindicate the public interest schiffer said 
the 60day review requirement has imposed very severe time 
constraints on the commercial fraud section of the justice 
department schiffer said 
it obviously means were not able to take the cases in the 
order we would take cases schiffer said 
michael hertz who heads the commercial fraud section said a 
study he conducted showed his staff of 40 attorneys has spent about 
25 percent of its time reviewing false claims suits 
in the period of time hertz reviewed false claims act suits 
generated between 5 and 10 million for the government compared 
with 175 million produced by cases developed by federal 
investigators 
you get some idea of the amount of resources going to qui tam 
cases versus the payoff hertz said 
recently the government has intervened in some large cases that 
have the potential of big settlements 
other big cases will probably increase the returns to the 
treasury from the qui tam provision but whether it is going 
to come up to the level of justifying spending all the time on it i 
have no idea hertz said

some shouted approval and some 
jeered on sunday as the men of appenzell outerrhodes state 
gathered in this little village and decided by show of hands to 
give women the right to vote 
i can look my wife in the eye again said one man 
reflecting the relief of many of the 5000 men who voted 
neighboring appenzell innerrhodes now is the only one of 
switzerlands 26 sovereign states or cantons that still denies 
women the vote on local issues ranging from budget questions to 
alcohol laws 
the issue was by no means clearcut in appenzell outerrhodes a 
canton of 50000 people 
four times in the past 17 years the state parliament an 
openair assembly comprised of all the states eligible voters 
has rejected womens suffrage 
emotions ran high sunday as the men bearing swords as a sign of 
their voting eligibility began gathering in hundwil for the latest 
vote 
a seemingly equal number of hands were raised by those on both 
sides of the issue the pronouncement by local official hans uli 
hoehl that a majority had voted yes was greeted by shouts of 
surprise and some jeers 
a tradition has been destroyed commented one man 
state authorities had urged acceptance of the proposal to let 
women participate in the landsgemeinde or parliament because of 
fears the swiss government would act unilaterally and impose 
federal legislation ensuring equal voting rights 
women won the national vote in a 1971 referendum ten years 
later another nationwide poll changed the constitution to make 
all swiss equal before the law 
the debate on womens rights has raged for many years in 
appenzell many men argued that allowing women to participate in 
the local popular parliament the original form of switzerlands 
direct democracy would damage the unique atmosphere of the 
landsgemeinde 
a substantial number of women seemed to share that view a 
198687 survey in which half the adult population of appenzell 
outerrhodes took part found only 57 percent of women favored 
having the right to vote 
at sundays meeting the parliament also agreed to vote before 
1993 on whether to abolish itself replacing the onceayear 
landsgemeinde with another system 
only five cantons in northeastern switzerland still retain the 
landsgemeinde

a 1931 photograph on a wall at the 
headquarters at the air forces chanute technical training center 
shows a soldier dangling from a biplane his parachute caught on 
its tail 
residents of this central illinois town where nearly half the 
people and twothirds of the economy are associated with the base 
feel they too are dangling because the base is one of 86 congress 
voted to close 
mayor katy podagrosi said it could take two years to exhaust 
efforts in the courts and in congress to remove chanute from the 
list 
thats not long when the stakes are as high as they are 
said podagrosi 
the big problem is the uncertainty said al vogelsang owner 
of gery amp als sporting goods will it actually close how long 
will it take for them to leave and how soon can we get something in 
there to take chanutes place 
the house voted 38143 on april 18 to reject a resolution to 
disapprove the recommendations of the base closure and realignment 
commission 
that meant the recommendations now goes into effect giving 
defense secretary dick cheney the goahead to implement the 
recommendations beginning in january the law creating the 
commission required that the entire package take effect unless both 
houses of congress voted to disapprove it 
the pentagon contends the closings will save taxpayers 693 
million a year 
but residents hope a judge will agree that the commissions 
report included misleading information about chanute 
illinois congressmen have argued that transcripts of commission 
deliberations have shown that discussions about chanute involved 
figures and reports that were more than a decade old 
commission members acknowledged they invented property values at 
chanute creating unrealistic estimates of savings they also 
referred to chanute as an empty air base despite 51 training 
programs that graduate 24000 students a year several members 
disclosed they didnt know where the base was 
chanute now one of five air force technical training centers 
opened in 1917 and reached its peak during world war ii training 
more than 200000 soldiers 
the 2400acre base located within the rantoul city limits has 
239 buildings 1473 family housing units and dormitories for 5879 
servicemen 
there are about 3000 students 3100 regular military personnel 
and 2400 civilian workers the annual payroll including retired 
servicemen living in the area is 169 million 
illinois congressmen hope to block the closing through the 
appropriations process congress still must appropriate the money 
for shortterm expenses associated with closing the bases 
critics of closing note that the government has spent 422 
million in the last five years on new or improved facilities at 
chanute 
sen alan dixon dill examined a nearly complete 65 million 
military weather school and a partially constructed 46 million 
officers dormitory last week saying somebody in washington has 
to be very stupid to close this base before anyone lives in it 
everybody here will go somewhere else and theyll have to 
reproduce all of these facilities at another base said dixon 
podagrosi said closure would mean loss of 65 percent of the 
towns economic activity along with about 8000 of its 20000 
residents 
a university of illinois study estimated onethird of the 3075 
singlefamily homes would be for sale and that property values 
would drop 20 percent 
the loss of chanute also would create hardships for about 5000 
retired military people who count on free medical care and 
prescriptions on base as well as reduced prices in base stores 
frank elliott economic development director for rantoul said 
there are other options for the base such as industries or schools 
we havent given up the cause yet but were looking at these 
other possibilities said elliott 
residents hope chanute will stay open so rantouls ordeal ends 
as happily as the dangling paratroopers predicament ended 58 years 
ago 
a fellow airman walked out on the wing of a second plane and 
lowered a knife to the young man who then cut himself free and 
floated to safety

theyre not as glitzy as the stores other 
malls in this affluent suburban shopping mecca but the shops at 
the brandnew magic mall have a few things over their competitors 
they will teach us kids how to run our own businesses and 
avoid bankruptcy said thirdgrader warren johnson i think 
they are fun because they offer different ways of learning and 
best of all they are all my size 
magic mall an elaborate wooden structure housing a dozen 
enterprises opened last wednesday at kent gardens elementary 
school with the goal of teaching children here a business 
persons mentality said principal robyn hooker 
the mall is a 20000plus project that takes up a spare 
multipurpose pod area in an airy carpeted skylit new wing of 
the school outside washington dc 
private sources including a local bank and three development 
and construction companies picked up the tab parents in the 
fields of filmmaking architecture and consumer advocacy played 
key roles and everyone involved has become a missionary for school 
malls 
this is but one example its a model it could be done in 
every community in the country its not difficult said ed 
rothschild the consumer advocate 
we are ready to pass the torch to washington dc and a 
depressed school said hooker you dont have to have the 
luxury of a pod area to do this your facilities dont have to be 
this elaborate you dont have to have a computer in each shop 
based on the childrens enthusiasm the other pieces will fall in 
place 
payrolls profits losses investments and inventory will be 
among the concerns addressed by the thirdgraders and eventually 
fourthgraders who run the shops at magic mall each venture will 
start off with an imaginary 20000 in capital to be multiplied or 
diminished depending on the skill and grades of the students 
students will write letters and mail them at the post office 
publish books put out a newspaper invest in stocks at a market 
exchange conduct experiments at a science store cook at a

before the first ballot was cast political 
seers from president bush on down were predicting widespread fraud 
in this weeks presidential elections in panama 
at the same time a bipartisan consensus often rare in foreign 
policy issues emerged saying the de facto ruler gen manuel 
antonio noriega had to go 
relations between the united states and panama have been on the 
skids since february 1988 when noriega was indicted by a federal 
grand jury in miami on drug trafficking charges thenpresident 
eric arturo delvalle a few weeks later attempted to force noriega 
out only to be ousted himself by the general 
the united states recognizes delvalle who lives in miami as 
panamas legitimate president which has led to a political vacuum 
that has caused a host of problems ranging from snags in panama 
canal treaty negotiations to incidents against american citizens 
neither traditional diplomacy nor the cutoff of economic and 
military aid nor economic sanctions have achieved the stated goal 
noriegas ouster 
the elections scheduled for sunday pit noriegas candidate 
carlos alberto duque against guillermo david endara running on an 
antigovernment coalition ticket 
in the united states democrats and republicans alike claim the 
general will stack the ballots in favor of noriega the panamanians 
charge the united states with interfering in their internal 
politics 
in recent weeks the noriega regime has taken steps to commit 
systematic fraud president bush said last week the people and 
the government of the united states will not recognize fraudulent 
election results engineered by noriega 
the panamanians claim the united states is pouring millions of 
dollars into the opposition campaigns the national endowment for 
democracy a nonprofit federally funded washington group 
provided 99000 this year to an antinoriega coalition adelina 
reyesgavilan senior program director for latin america said 
the bush administration citing security has refused to comment 
on reports published in april saying the president signed a secret 
directive to grant the opposition group 10 million 
the state department recently issued a twopage statement 
outlining the activities the noriega regime is undertaking to 
control the results of elections the paper cited false voter 
lists vote buying fabricated polls visas aimed at barring 
foreign observers coercion intimidation and detentions 
the polls are so bad that hed noriega have to steal it big 
time said rep patricia schroeder dcolo 
the liberal council on hemispheric affairs has published several 
statements charging noriega with preelection fraud for financing 
his candidate with government funds and barring opposition media 
from operating 
on the conservative side michael g wilson a political analyst 
with the heritage foundation said rigging the elections was 
certain 
congress approved 100000 for election observer missions and 
administration officials say bush will appoint an official observer 
team that will include members of congress executive branch 
officials and private citizens 
the administration also is encouraging the efforts of private 
watchdog groups and ken wollack executive vice president of the 
national democratic institute said a group of about 50 people 
including 18 americans planned to leave thursday for panama 
former presidents carter and ford were to be part of the private 
delegation 
carter negotiated the 1977 panama canal treaties which call for 
the united states to turn the americanbuilt waterway over to 
panama on dec 31 1999 the current problems with the government 
there have caused several people to question the us commitment 
when the treaty was negotiated no one had an idea panama and 
the united states would not be speaking to each other michael 
rhode jr assistant to the chairman of the panama canal 
commission said its going to create a real problem 
rhode said the treaty provisions have stalemated because there 
isnt an avenue for any communications with the united states and 
the regime in panama under the timetable of the canal treaty a 
panamanian is to be named administrator of the commission on jan 
1 1990 
anyone would have a problem if hes ever been associated with 
noriega rhode said 
he said panama canal revenues of 982 million were being held 
in escrow as part of the us sanctions 
there isnt a clear policy commitment in washington toward 
panama said wilson of the heritage foundation we need to try 
to renegotiate the treaties for our national security 
sen richard lugar rind said the bush administration needed 
to adopt plans for panama 
it has not been clear that the administration or congress had 
a strategy on what to do the senator said in a telephone 
interview well have to take whatever force we need to defend 
our people and the canal we ought to be saying that now not after 
the election 
some 10000 us troops and 40000 americans live in panama 
american servicemen have been harassed by noriegas panamanian 
defense forces foreign journalists have been expelled and 
panamanian defense forces recently stopped several school buses 
carrying american children 
juan b sosa recognized in the united states as panamas 
ambassador said noriega would steal the elections and feared 
violence would break out 
the panamanian defense forces are going to have to decide if 
theyll fire on their own people or take noriega out themselves 
he said in a recent interview at the embassy its that 
explosive

one federal health report seemed to suggest many 
aids patients survive for up to eight years after their diagnosis 
but a researcher says most presumed survivors have actually died 
and their deaths not reported 
a monthly report from the centers for disease control listed 14 
adults and two children who were diagnosed with aids more than 
eight years ago and still are not listed among the dead 
if those statistics are an accurate portrayal of aids in 
america as many as 20 percent of the known patients from the 
diseases earliest known days when the number of patients was a 
fraction of what it is today are still alive giving rise to a 
hope that aids is survivable in a number of cases 
but cdc scientists and other aids experts acknowledge that most 
of those early survivors along with many others from more 
recent years probably have died their deaths unreported to the 
federal government but at least some people are living for five 
years or more and have been confirmed to have the disease 
people who are not listed as dead are not necessarily alive 
said dr ann hardy who spearheaded a cdc study looking at these 
people are they really alive did they really have aids 
ms hardy who has since transferred to the national center for 
health statistics said her study managed to track down at least 
some information on 780 people who by statistical count seemed to 
have survived aids since being diagnosed in 1983 or before 
in fact the cdc study confirmed that 475 or 61 percent of 
those 780 presumed survivors had indeed died but local health 
officials had not reported their deaths to the federal government 
an additional 186 or 24 percent are lost to followup she 
said what we would probably guess is that a good proportion are 
dead but they went out of the country or to another state and 
the local health departments lost track of them 
the remaining 119 pre1984 aids patients were still alive at the 
time of the study which was conducted in 198788 researchers 
tried to have those patients tested to confirm that they actually 
had aids since aids tests did not come into use until the 
mid1980s many early aids diagnoses based on symptoms alone may 
be wrong they reasoned 
out of 47 people diagnosed with aids before 1984 who agreed to 
blood tests six showed no sign of aids infection the remaining 41 
were confirmed as living patients of acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
while the mortality is high there are some who are 
surviving mortality is not 100 percent ms hardy said there 
are some people doing fairly well there are a lot of 
possibilities as to why but its impossible to sort out 
the cdc study found nine people diagnosed with aids in 1981 or 
earlier who were still alive but none would agree to blood tests 
to confirm that they actually had aids ms hardy said 
in san francisco which has the nations thirdhighest number of 
aids cases behind new york and los angeles the department of 
public health tracks individual aids patients researchers there 
said that as of the end of 1988 24 aids patients were believed to 
be alive five years or longer after diagnosis including one who 
had survived eight years 
thats a very small number said dr george lemp chief of 
the aids surveillance branch at the san francisco department of 
public health our estimate of survival is 3 percent past five 
years 
scientists have reported in recent years that the survival time 
for some aids patients is lengthening diagnoses have improved and 
doctors now can use drugs to treat some of the deadly diseases let 
in by the weakened immune systems of aids patients such as a rare 
form of pneumonia and even tuberculosis 
still lemp said the prognosis for aids patients remains poor 
there are a small proportion of persons who appear to live 
beyond five years but we dont know if there are any specific 
reasons for that other than there may be some individual factor 
involved he said

a study of five major companies suggests some 
of the nations railroads are underreporting accidents and injuries 
and failing to keep proper records on such incidents the general 
accounting office said sunday 
the study concluded that the shortcomings were due to inadequate 
internal railroad procedures some of which have since been 
corrected the report said 
the gao the congressional investigative agency did not accuse 
any of the railroads of purposely withholding information from the 
federal railroad administration which collects the data 
nonetheless the investigators expressed alarm at the problem 
saying it raises questions about the overall effectiveness of 
fras safety program and the extent to which railroads have become 
safer 
dan lang a spokesman for the association of american railroads 
said he could not comment on specifics in the gao report because he 
was not given an advance copy 
but lang said there could be room for disagreement over 
whether particular accidents satisfied the thresholds for injury 
and damage above which federal regulations require a report to the 
fra 
i really would doubt theres any kind of systematic 
underreporting going on he said 
investigators audited five railroads csx transportation and 
union pacific two of the countrys largest freight carriers 
amtrak the federally subsidized passenger carrier and two 
regional lines chicago and north western transportation co and 
chicago central and pacific railroad 
the five carriers together accounted for onethird of the 
accidents and injuries reported to the government in 1987 
the report said of 521 unreported injuries and 532 unreported 
accidents studied 61 injuries and 52 accidents should have been 
reported to the fra 
four of the railroads underestimated the number of lost workdays 
resulting from 156 injuries by 269 percent and estimated damages 
resulting from 171 accidents were understated by 35 million or 
52 percent the study said 
the report was requested by rep john dingell dmich chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committee who has urged 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner to follow its 
recommendations which include requiring railroads to set up 
reporting procedures and allowing federal officials to take legal 
actions against rail lines with inadequate internal controls

the wife and daughter of one of chinas most 
prominent imprisoned dissidents were allowed to visit him in jail 
sunday for the first time in more than three years 
kan tong and her daughter xu jin said they visited xu wenli 
for 30 minutes at beijings no 1 prison they were accompanied by 
five police officers and one stenographer who scribbled what they 
said in a small blue book 
police told them not to touch xu who was sentenced in 1981 to 
15 years in jail for counterrevolutionary crimes they said 
authorities refused xus request to kiss his 16yearold daughter 
at the end of the meeting kan defied the order and shook her 
husbands hand 
it was cold and dry she said his hand was shaking 
she said her husband had turned into a bag of bones 
his hair is completely white and all the teeth on the left 
side of his mouth have fallen out 
he is this thin said xu jin holding up one of her fragile 
arms i have never seen a man so thin 
no family member had been allowed to visit xu since oct 10 
1985 after an essay by xu titled my selfdefense was 
smuggled out of prison in it xu gave details of his arrest and 
prosecution in an account critical of the regime 
prison authorities further punished him by moving him from an 
86squarefoot room to a 43squarefoot cell she said citing his 
letters and reports from sources in the jail guards took away his 
bed and forced him to sleep on bricks lights were always on 
xu an electrician by profession was a leader of the democracy 
wall movement of 1978 and published an unsanctioned periodical 
calling for political change in the journalapril 5th forum 
which was mimeographed in his home xu argued that a multiparty 
system was not anticommunist and would help the socialist cause 
the movement was tolerated by chinas new leader deng xiaoping 
until he consolidated power after that a crackdown came 
xu is one of chinas most famous dissidents but his fame is 
greater outside china a testimony to the power of chinas 
staterun press to limit access to information 
most of those currently participating in a beijing student 
movement for democracy and a free press dont know who xu is 
since january a growing number of chinese intellectuals have 
called for the release of political prisoners the government 
denies it has any political prisoners 
kan said news of the current prodemocracy protests made her 
husband happy 
he may be weak but his spirit is still there she said he 
is still xu wenli 
she said prison officials told her saturday that a request to 
see her husband had been approved 
we hope you can help us educate xu wenli read a letter from 
the prison therefore we will consider your request 
recently xus treatment appears to have improved since 1985 
kan said 
throughout the meeting she had trouble looking at her husband 
she said 
we sat there on benches the police were on high chairs 
sitting above us both of us just looked at our hands he was 
shaking he shook throughout the meeting then he cried 
xu jin said she only looked at her father once 
i asked him if i was a woman yet she said he said im 
still a little girl then i couldnt look at him anymore i drank 
tea 
kan said prison authorities allowed her to give xu a bag of 
goodies including his favorite fish dish sesame oil hot pepper 
oil and a recent book by richard nixon 
thirty minutes went fast she said i dont know whether 
there will be a next time

a wallaroo that was apparently not in the 
mood for mating may have set a new high jump record when it escaped 
from the walk in the wild zoo by leaping a 7foot fence 
the animals caretaker mike cassell said he was putting a 
female wallaroo a cross between a kangaroo and a wallaby inside 
a wire enclosure housing a male wallaroo at the zoo when the male 
escaped friday afternoon 
cassell other zoo workers and spokane county animal control 
employees searched for the 3foottall dark gray animal in the 
brushy areas along the spokane river before it was finally cornered 
in the front yard of a residence about two miles from the zoo 
zookeeper john mclachlan injected the wallaroo with an 
anesthetic but it took four people to pick up the struggling 
animal and put it in a truck to be returned to the zoo 
cassell was relieved at the successful recovery 
if the animal is stressed bad enough ive seen them quiver up 
and die he said during the chase theyre really docile 
animals im amazed that he would even try to cross the road 
theyre that timid 
wallaroos arent usually so flighty and cassell said this was 
the first one to ever bolt from the zoo 
the animal first escaped the wire enclosure and then after an 
emu started chasing it it jumped over the 7foot fence 
cassell said according to the book its not able to jump over 
four feet i guess this one never read the book

a drug war situation room unveiled by president 
bush last week and one like it in california may be the nations 
most sophisticated antismuggling weapons yet but some question 
whether such hightech wizardry can do much 
bush dedicated the customs servicecoast guard interdiction 
center thursday during a visit to miami where he also addressed 
top latin american drugfighting officials at an international 
conference 
think of this as one of americas drug war situation rooms as 
our early warning network against narcotics bush said after 
watching a computer simulation of a drug interdiction in which 
smugglers were tracked through the skies and seas off miami and 
intercepted by jets and speedboats 
the command control communications and intelligence center or 
c3i is in a squat peachcolored building southwest of miami in a 
field dotted with radar antennas 
information from a network of land sea and air radar monitored 
by the federal aviation administration customs the coast guard 
and the pentagon will be displayed on a video system 
specialists will compare radar data with faa flight plans field 
updates and intelligence reports to keep track of up to 5000 boats 
and planes across more than 12 million square miles in the eastern 
united states 
c3i west in riverside calif has directed air interdiction 
west of houston since august 
my sources within the defense department say they dont have 
anything to match c3i from a technical standpoint its a very 
sophisticated system designed specifically for drug interdiction 
said rep glenn english dokla former chairman of the house 
subcommittee responsible for overseeing the drug war 
theres no better way we could spend this 33 million said 
customs commissioner william von raab standing in front of a 
customs blackhawk helicopter outside the center thursday 
we were absolutely defenseless in our air borders five years 
ago you could fly anywhere into the united states and not stand a 
snowballs chance of getting caught von raab said now we are 
well out in front of the smugglers and we are never going to fall 
behind again 
others arent so confident they point to longstanding problems 
such as interagency rivalry a lack of equipment such as radar 
planes and boats and a shortage of intelligence 
you have to recognize youre going up against an entity that 
is bringing in 150 billion a year roughly half of our total 
defense spending with 67 billion a year from the us 
government english said 
cocaine seizures virtually nonexistent before the 1980s are 
growing nationwide 
the coast guard hauled in 14591 pounds in fiscal 1988 up from 
12950 in 1987 customs seized 138808 pounds in fiscal 1988 
compared to a combined 140419 in 1986 and 1987 
marijuana seizures by both agencies have dropped sharply in what 
officials say is a sign that the law is forcing smugglers to move 
to lower risk higher profit cocaine 
but authorities intercept at best only about 10 percent of the 
3500 flights and 4500 boat trips smugglers make each year 
according to the congressional office of technology assessment 
upwards of 18 million pounds of marijuana 300000 pounds of 
cocaine and 13000 pounds of heroin will be smuggled into the 
country this year the office estimates 
before the c3i center can improve these numbers gaps in the 
radar network must be filled by awacs planes and balloons said 
coast guard adm paul yost 
until we have enough of them it will be possible for druggies 
to fly around us the c3i is not going to correct that yost 
said within the next 12 months well double our radars and this 
will make a big difference 
its the most capable air interdiction center in the world 
and if it works the way its supposed to work ill be very 
pleased he said but there arent enough assets in the world 
to seal our border to the two to three tons of cocaine that cross 
it every week

for the first time in 50 years the metropolitan 
opera has treated audiences to richard wagners mammoth ring 
cycle the oldfashioned way performing all four operas within a 
single week as the composer intended 
and what a treat it was 
seen in its 17hour entirety last week the production though 
not as adventurous as some would have liked bore out most of the 
hopes of those who have watched it gradually unveiled over the last 
2 years and it proved itself an instant crowdpleaser drawing 
lusty cheers from a standingroomonly crowd of nearly 4000 who 
paid up to 620 apiece for the four performances 
the staging by otto schenk with strikingly traditional sets and 
costumes by guenther schneidersiemssen brings to life with loving 
care wagners fantastical world of dwarfs dragons and demigods 
shunning the current habit of squeezing wagners untidy 
mythmaking into a political economic or psychological mold 
schenk schneidersiemssen and conductor james levine aim to let 
the drama and the music unfold on their own terms they may not 
have any new insights into this epic about the theft of a golden 
ring and the disasters that befall all who pursue it but they do a 
magnificent job of retelling the story as wagner wrote it 
the naturalistic sets and costumes depict the fairytale scenes 
and characters for what they are and nothing more the rhinemaidens 
are really mermaids not prostitutes as in one production and 
their river is not a hydroelectric dam wotan is really the king of 
the gods not a 19th century capitalist siegfried is really a 
noble young warrior not a garage mechanic 
ironically this literal interpretation has brought down the 
wrath of some critics who accuse the met of pandering to the 
reactionary tastes of wealthy patrons who financed the production 
but levine who is also the mets artistic director has 
defended the conservative choice on grounds that the company needs 
a solid production it can live with well into the next century not 
one that will seem dated or illconceived within a few years 
with no external viewpoint to hold the audiences interest the 
singing and orchestral playing must be special indeed if the 
production is to work its magic and here the met played its strong 
suit the orchestra sounded splendid all week and levine propelled 
the music forward with a fine sense of dramatic tension 
among the singers hildegard behrens once again showed that she 
is the finest bruennhilde of the postbirgit nilsson era though 
she lacks the overpowering vocal resources of a great wagnerian 
soprano she makes up for that with dramatic intensity as she 
changes before our eyes from a frisky young valkyrie to a 
passionate and then betrayed lover and finally to a compassionate 
woman whose sacrifice returns the ring to its rightful owners the 
rhinemaidens 
james morris was a superior wotan his brilliant high notes 
cutting through the heavy orchestration with ease another 
magnificent bass matti salminen carried off the rare feat of 
appearing in all four operas as fafner a giant in das 
rheingold transformed into a dragon in siegfried as

two scientists who have been taken aback 
by attacks on their experimental claims of roomtemperature nuclear 
fusion have lashed out at the source of the latest rebuff the 
british scientific journal nature 
fusion researchers b stanley pons and martin fleischmann said 
the prestigious journal forced them to withdraw their paper and 
made inaccurate statements and that one editor was mumbling in 
the dark the deseret news quoted them as saying in sundays 
editions 
on march 23 pons a chemistry professor at the university of 
utah and fleischmann of englands university of southampton 
announced that an experiment involving palladium and platinum 
electrodes immersed in heavy water had yielded energy indicating 
nuclear fusion had taken place heavy water is like ordinary water 
except that ordinary hydrogen atoms have been replaced by 
deuterium a heavier cousin or isotope of hydrogen 
further the scientists claimed the socalled cold fusion 
experiment had yielded more than four times the energy needed to 
produce it previous attempts at fusion have involved extremely 
high temperatures 
while laboratories around the world have duplicated the 
experiment and reported similar results others have reported 
failures and critics have remained unconvinced 
nature in an april 27 edition that contained several articles 
on fusion speculated that the utah experiment is fatally flawed 
and will never be verified 
the utah phenomenon is literally unsupported by the evidence 
could be an artifact and given its improbability is most likely to 
be one wrote john maddox editor of the 120yearold magazine 
pons said nature had dipped to sensationalism of the worst 
type i have never in my life seen such a scandal by a scientific 
journal to discredit two people they have a privileged position 
that they are using 
fleischmann criticized natures repeated accusations that he and 
pons leaked to reporters their intent to submit to nature a 
scientific paper on their experiments 
at the march 23 press conference we stated it was quite 
incorrect to disclose the the name of the journal we were 
submitting to because it would restrict the freedom of action of 
the editor fleischmann said 
it could have only come from other people submitting papers 
or from reviewers or the staff of nature itself he said i 
think its an impertinence that nature feels itself entitled to 
repeat an allegation which is untrue 
they said that on the same day they made their announcement 
they submitted a preliminary paper to nature and met natures 
requirements for submission 
after their researchers more lengthy scientific paper was 
published in the journal of electroanalytical chemistry pons said 
nature requested substantially more information 
nature gave them three days to revise and beef up their original 
submission at a time when they had heavy speaking and research 
obligations they said 
they forced us to withdraw it by deadlining us and breaking 
their own rules pons said 
pons and fleischmann said they replied in full to questions 
posed by reviewers assigned by nature to read their manuscript 
sending the replies to nature they accused the magazine of not 
forwarding the replies to the reviewers though the publication had 
accused them of failing to respond to the reviewers comments 
we did reply it is they the editors who did not send the 
replies to the reviewers fleischmann alleged 
david lindley natures assistant physics editor said there is 
frustration in the scientific world because the experiment hasnt 
been confirmed and that pons and fleischmann are inaccessible to 
researchers 
i cant understand why if they are so certain they arent 
helping out other people 
pons called lindleys statements ludicrous 
the editors of nature have no idea who we have been talking 
to who has seen the experiment how many people have been given 
our data how many scientists we are collaborating with pons 
said he lindley is mumbling in the dark

an official takes an hour to lay out japans 
position on a thorny trade issue then comes to the bottom line on 
tokyos response to washingtons demand its impossible 
not all issues between japan and the united states are that 
difficult the two countries agreed on how to divide the 
development and production of a new fighter based on the f16 for 
japans air force a matter that involves security and technology 
issues as well as trade 
but enough trade issues fit into the difficulttoimpossible 
category that this country is braced for a hard time as washington 
decides on using the hammer of the new trade act to cut japans 55 
billion trade surplus with the united states 
virtually simultaneous with president bushs announcement friday 
of the coproduction deal on the fighter us trade representative 
carla hills hit japan a double blow 
japan was given more space than any other country in a report 
on 34 countries said to have significant barriers to imports from 
the united states the list is to be used to set priorities for 
washington to start intensive negotiations under the 1988 trade act 
and eliminate the barriers otherwise sanctions may be imposed 
in the area of telecommunications equipment ms hills moved 
directly to the verge of sanctions charging that japan had 
failed to live up to all its commitments she declared that 
us officials now will consider how to penalize japanese companies 
through higher import duties or other restrictions washington 
reports said 
telecommunications equipment accounts for a big slice of the 
us trade deficit us commerce department statistics show a 22 
billion deficit with japan in this sector in 1987 
it was the area described as impossible by toru arizono a 
director of the communications policy bureau in the ministry of 
posts and telecommunications 
interviewed before the us action arizono produced us 
commerce department documents showing japan as second only to the 
united states in permitting foreign companies easy access to the 
telecommunications market 
he said the problem originated solely with the motorola company 
which he said was trying through political means to get what it 
had been unable to attain in japans market for cellular car 
telephones 
other us companies are not submitting anything to us 
arizono said if all were complaining then we would make a 
maximum effort to see that there is fair competition among all 
companies 
motorola complains that japans failure to allocate a frequency 
for its car phones in tokyo blocks the company from access to a 
market it estimated as worth 2 billion during the next 10 years 
arizono explained that ddi the japanese company marketing 
motorola car phones agreed several years ago to divide the country 
with another japanese firm which got the tokyonagoya area while 
ddimotorola got the rest of the country 
the problem was that they were using incompatible systems and 
though technical advice was against it the ministry agreed to the 
establishment of two radio systems 
motorolaequipped cars from osaka however cannot connect to 
the phone system if they come to tokyo arizono said and so 
motorola wanted a third radio system to accommodate its demands 
there are no radio spectrum resources in the tokyo area he 
said its impossible 
the best japan could do he said was to have motorola and other 
foreign suppliers help to set worldwide technical standards for the 
next step in car phones digital operation so there would be no 
problems of interconnection 
digital car phones will be coming in a few years he said 
the bush administration wants faster progress in the short run 
washingtons tough line on trade however risks a combative 
response from japan 
japanese officials reacted sharply to both us trade moves 
friday foreign minister sousuke uno said the threat of sanctions 
on telecommunications equipment was extremely regrettable he 
warned that japan might charge the united states with unfair trade 
practices under the world trade pact called the general agreement 
on tariffs and trade 
the minister for international trade and industry hiroshi 
mitsuzuka said in a statement as he departed for trade talks in 
washington that the overall report on import barriers showed us 
misunderstanding of japanese trade policy 
it is very disappointing that our intention has never been 
understood by us representatives despite many bilateral talks 
mitsuzuka said

the government should reopen an investigation 
into the deaths of more than 750 bottlenose dolphins on the 
atlantic coast to determine whether pollutants weakened their 
immune systems say two new jersey congressmen 
the most likely cause of the dolphins deaths was fish tainted 
by a naturally occurring neurotoxin known as brevetoxin found in 
red tide algae swept north from the gulf of mexico said a report 
released jointly last week by the national marine fisheries 
service office of naval research and marine mammal commission 
but it also said brevetoxin was found in tissue samples from 
only eight of 17 beached dolphins tested accounting for fewer than 
half of the tested and only a fraction of the 750 who were stranded 
on beaches in 1987 and 1988 
citing that discrepancy reps frank pallone and rep jim 
saxton dnj backed by environmentalists urged that the 
investigation be reopened 
it is critically important to find out for certain whether or 
not water quality or a manmade chemical contributed to the 
dolphins deaths said saxton 
a spokesman for the national oceanographic and atmospheric 
administration acknowledged the need for more study but said some 
politicians and environmentalists were using the issue to draw 
attention to pollution 
there are individuals and groups who have a vested interest in 
having manmade pollution be the sole cause said noaa spokesman 
brian gorman 
brevetoxin does not stay in living tissues after three to five 
days gorman said which might account for its absence from some of 
the tissue samples 
the report said many questions will remain unanswered until 
directed studies are pursued including a look at chronic 
exposure to the toxin a determination of environmental conditions 
that led to the deaths and examination of a representative sample 
of stranded marine mammals for biological toxins 
equally important is the need to resolve the growing question 
of whether contaminants at levels found in the dolphins might have 
affected their resilience and rendered them more susceptible either 
to the toxin or the the microorganisms that eventually brought them 
to their demise the study said 
bruce mckay a marine biologist with greenpeace said the 
government report found that tissue from the dead dolphins 
contained high levels of pcbs which are known immune system 
suppressors 
the levels overall were among the highest levels ever found in 
the marine mammal population mckay said and could have weakened 
dolphin immune systems or compromised the dolphins abilities to 
withstand exposure to compounds such as brevetoxin and bacteria 
the house merchant marine and fisheries committee subcommittee 
on oversight and investigations has scheduled a hearing may 9 to 
hear testimony from the author of the report dr joseph r geraci 
of the university of guelph in ontario canada

pope john paul ii on sunday 
beatified a 19th century woman who protected the catholic church 
from persecution lauding her as a model for women and lay people 
the pope on the third day of his visit to this african island 
nation also spoke against inequality and corruption 
the pope beatified victoire rasoamanarivo in a threehour 
service before a crowd estimated by local organizers at 500000 
about half the capitals population 
beatification is a first step toward possible sainthood 
mrs rasoamanarivo who died in 1894 at 46 is considered the 
savior of the roman catholic church in this nation of 11 million 
people 22 percent of whom are catholic 
the granddaughter of a prime minister she converted to the 
faith at 13 to the consternation of her pagan parents 
when catholic missionaries were expelled from madagascar in 
1883 she fought to keep catholic schools open traveled the 
countryside to encourage the faithful and appealed to the royal 
family to respect religious rights 
when missionaries were allowed to return in 1886 they found the 
church was still thriving 
those few years of service left a reminder that is still very 
much alive said the pope speaking in french from a raised 
cementandredbrick altar she is a model for the lay faithful 
today 
the pope cited her work with the poor the sick and prisoners 
and held her up as an example for women in the church 
the pope also hailed the courageous fidelity victoire showed 
the sacrament of marriage despite the problems of her marriage 
her husband radriaka son of the prime minister was a 
notorious drinker and womanizer but before dying after falling 
off a balcony in their 18th year of their marriage he accepted his 
wifes plea to be baptized church officials said 
the pope has frequently condemned discrimination against women 
and called for their greater participation in church affairs 
though not as priests 
after the beatification a dozen barefoot girls and boys 
performed a dance beside the altar the crowd many wearing yellow 
caps emblazoned papa joany paoly ii sang hymns in malagasy 
the countrys language 
among those present was president didier ratsiraka a catholic 
later the pope offered his blessing to prisoners in madagascar 
noting without elaborating that some face a very painful 
situation 
amnesty international said it received reports that at least one 
prisoner died each day in early 1987 in the main antanimora prison 
because of malnourishment and disease 
in a speech later to lay people the pope said catholics had an 
obligation to improve their society 
the church has been openly critical of madagascars government 
madagascar is a 225000squaremile island off southeast africa 
since a communist revolution in 1975 its economy has declined 
the pope on his fifth tour of africa leaves monday for the 
french island of reunion then visits zambia and malawi

president bush does not share defense 
secretary dick cheneys view that soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev will fail in his efforts to reform the soviet union a 
senior white house aide said sunday 
i think the president and secretary of state james a baker 
are hoping that gorbachevs movement towards reform and 
restructuring the soviet union does succeed sununu said on the 
nbctv program meet the press 
it is an opportunity to establish a relationship continue the 
relationship that has begun he said referring to cheneys 
prediction that gorbachev will fail sununu said i dont think 
that is the presidents view 
bush en route to new york declined to comment directly on 
cheneys comments saying i never comment until i know exactly 
what he said 
pressed for views on gorbachev bush said we want perestroika 
to succeed 
cheney predicted in an interview broadcast saturday that 
gorbachev ultimately will fail and be replaced by a leader less 
friendly to the west and he argued against major unilateral arms 
control concessions 
the conflicting administration assessments of gorbachevs 
chances for success come amid a debate within the north atlantic 
treaty organization over whether to modernize shortrange us 
lance nuclear missiles stationed in west germany 
german chancellor helmut kohl has called for immediate 
negotiations with the soviets on eliminating shortrange nuclear 
missiles a step the bush administration opposes on grounds it will 
leave nato ground forces exposed to larger warsaw pact armies 
gorbachev tightened his grip on power last week by forcing the 
retirement of 74 aging members of the 301member communist party 
central committee but the party newspaper pravda subsequently 
published speeches by local party leaders saying gorbachevs 
reforms were in trouble and had worsened rather than improved the 
economy 
against this turbulent backdrop the bush administration has 
been conducting a strategic review embracing ussoviet relations 
and plans to resume negotiations in earnest with a planned trip to 
moscow on may 10 by secretary of state james a baker iii 
cheney in an interview broadcast saturday by the cable news 
network said he opposed major us troop withdrawals from europe 
because he feared that a more hostile leader might succeed 
gorbachev 
i think it would undo basic commitments to the alliance and 
until we know that gorbachev is for real and that the changes he 
wants to bring about are irreversible its be a terrible mistake 
for us to withdraw from europe cheney said 
i think you really have to distinguish between what he is 
trying to do and whether or not hes actually going to be able to 
do it cheney said 
and i think the bottom line is that if i had to guess today 
i would guess that he would ultimately fail that is to say that 
he would not be able to reform the soviet economy to turn it into 
an efficient modern society said cheney 
and when that happens hes likely to be replaced by somebody 
who will be farm more hostile than he has been in terms of his 
attitude toward the west he said 
cheney rejected calls by former secretary of state henry a 
kissinger and others for an immediate cut of the 100000 of the 
more than 300000 us troops in western europe 
i dont think we ought to move unilaterally in this area 
cheney said i think we ought to move in conjunction with the 
alliance the alliance put together a good negotiating posture 
its on the table in vienna where negotiations on conventional 
forces are underway

prime minister margaret thatcher 
of britain failed sunday to persuade chancellor helmut kohl to drop 
his demand that the superpowers begin talks soon on cutting 
shortrange nuclear missiles 
the two leaders trying to reach a compromise on a stalemate 
that has split the nato alliance described their talks as frank 
and intensive both admitted they could not solve the crisis 
we still have quite a lot of work to do kohl told reporters 
during a news conference with mrs thatcher after an afternoon of 
talks 
but kohl said he was optimistic the disagreement could be 
resolved before a north atlantic treaty organization summit in 
brussels on may 2930 
mrs thatcher also expressed optimism but stuck strongly to the 
usbritish position that rules out early talks with the soviets 
on shortrange nuclear weapons 
strength must continue not only in words strength has to be 
translated into weaponry she said 
mrs thatchers visit to the rhinelandpalatinate town of 
deidesheim was aimed at persuading kohl to drop his governments 
insistence on early talks a demand that has placed him in a battle 
of wills with mrs thatcher and president bush 
the west germans believe superpower arms talks should be 
attempted on a broad scale because of the current disarmament 
climate in moscow 
washington and london maintain talks on tactical nuclear 
arsenals should not begin as long as the warsaw pact alliance has a 
superiority in conventional forces 
the united states and britain also argue that it would be hard 
to stop the talks from progressing to the point where they would 
address the total elimination of tactical nuclear weapons in europe 
a goal of soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
under natos flexible response policy the allies could respond 
to a soviet bloc attack with either conventional or nuclear weapons 
shortrange nuclear weapons are absolutely vital for flexible 
response mrs thatcher said 
mrs thatcher said elimination of the weapons would mean that 
the soviet union will have achieved its objective of getting 
landbased nuclear weapons out of europe this i believe would be 
disastrous for us 
mrs thatcher at one point appeared to question whether kohl was 
in favor of an outright elimination of tactical nuclear weapons 
im sure mr kohl will correct me if i have misunderstood him on 
this issue she said 
kohl responded by having his interpreter read a line from his 
speech to parliament last week in which he rejected elimination of 
the tactical nuclear weapons under the present balance of military 
forces in europe 
but kohl also was adamant that the west german position on early 
talks be acknowledged 
most of natos shortrange nuclear weapons are based in west 
germany and would be used exclusively on german soil in a war 
kohl said he hoped a joint document which takes our special 
situation into account could be prepared at the brussels summit 
and that has nothing at all to do with the germans having 
become unreliable or anything like that kohl said referring to 
suggestions that west germany is no longer following agreedupon 
nato doctrine 
there can be no question of that kohl said we cannot be 
outshone by anyone in nato in our reliability 
kohl faced with uncertain election prospects next year also 
wants to delay until at least 1992 a decision on modernization and 
deployment of rockets to replace natos aging shortrange nuclear 
arsenal 
polls show most west germans no longer believe that the soviet 
union is a military threat and favor eliminating nuclear weapons 
from europe 
west european leaders are working to defuse the crisis italian 
and dutch leaders are to meet with west german officials after 
separate talks with mrs thatcher and west german authorities are 
going to france 
west germany claims it has outright support from nearly half the 
nato members denmark belgium norway italy greece and spain 
about 1000 people gathered in deidesheims town square to greet 
mrs thatcher as she arrived by motorcade 
mrs thatcher accompanied by kohl waved at the crowd as she 
walked the short distance from the town hall to the deidesheimerhof 
hotel were the talks were held 
many people waved miniature british flags as she passed by a 
handful of protesters carried banners denouncing mrs thatchers 
stand on the missile issue

sen phil gramm renewed his call sunday for 
declaration of a national crime emergency to quickly expand 
prison facilities and take other measures to help crack down on 
violent crime 
in america today we have crime without punishment gramm 
said noting that while 40000 people were arrested on felony 
charges last year in the district of columbia only 1400 of them 
went to prison 
gramm appearing on the cbs program face the nation 
asserted that no matter what else is done to deal with the root 
causes of crime we have got to take violent criminals off the 
streets 
now what were trying to do is to build more prisons 70000 
more prison beds said the texas republican we want a national 
crime emergency to allow us to go out on closed military bases 
pitch tents use temporary buildings put the violent criminals in 
jail and keep them there and do it now 
rep charles rangel dny said that its absolutely 
ridiculous to believe that our first line of defense should be 
spending the billions of dollars that we are in building jails 
without being willing to spend millions of dollars in finding out 
the reasons why people have this antisocial behavior 
also interviewed on the same program was peter reinharz chief 
prosecutor of the juvenile court in new york city where several 
teenagers have been arrested in a brutal attack april 19 on a 
28yearold investment banker while she was jogging in central park 
its evident that the juvenile justice system as it presently 
stands has no deterrent effect whatsoever in light of the 
increasing nature of the violence and the increasing severity of 
the crimes weve seen over the last several years reinharz said 
he said that for juvenile offenders theres very little threat 
of jail so maybe thats one of the things that has to change in 
order to bring about some sort of deterrent value 
reinharz said he also was particularly concerned about the 
increase in sex crimes among the very young 
we have 8yearolds 9yearolds 10yearolds committing 
forcible rape forcible sodomy aggravated sexual abuse he said

middle school students can go back to

lifting a prohibiton on the shirts isnt a victory for those who 
protested the ban 
the school last week banned students from wearing tshirts with 
the insignias of the rock bands guns n roses and black sabbath 
because the two bands music was tied to recent cult murders in 
matamoros mexico 
it is not a matter of winning or losing its a matter of 
educating youngsters so that we have caring and understanding and 
educated young people said jt landes principal at washington 
middle school 
the ban was enacted because of concerns raised by parents he 
said 
about 150 students protested thursday saying the ban violated 
their constitutional right to free speech about 60 pupils served 
oneday suspensions friday for defying the ban 
just because were little doesnt mean wer dont know about 
the constitution said one eighthgrader kanong yank 14 
school administrators decided this weekend to lift the ban 
provided the shirts dont display profanities or other violations 
of a dress code established by the green bay school board landes 
said 
parent and studentgroup meetings will be announced later to 
deal with concerns over the dress code landes said

father disconnected his respirator made funeral preparations 
sunday and the childs doctor said there had been no hope the 
infants condition would have improved 
sixteenmonthold samuel linares who had been comatose since 
swallowing a balloon last august died wednesday police said his 
father held off hospital workers at gunpoint tearfully unhooked 
the childs respirator and held him until he died 
rudy linares 23 of west suburban cicero faces a firstdegree 
murder charge he is free on 75000 bond 
linares said he did it because i loved my son i love my 
wife the funeral was planned for monday 
linares act revived an ethics debate over whether medicine 
should merely prolong life and it stirred a storm of opinions 
about laws governing hopelessly injured or sick children 
it prompted an outpouring of calls from parents whose children 
have died though many said they were disturbed by linares 
methods most said they sympathized with the emotions that drove 
him 
even the boys doctor dr gilbert goldman director of the 
pediatric intensive care unit at rushpresbyterianst lukes 
medical center said mercy should be used in dealing with linares 
i kept telling the dad i know its terrible but it wont 
last much longer goldman said 
sammy wasnt dead but he couldnt get better he said 
he remained highly unstable the first week or two but then he 
stabilized goldman said tests showed he was no longer at risk 
of immediate death he had brain activity but it was clear he would 
not live outside a chronic vegetative state 
i sincerely hope the dad will not be punished for this action 
although it was against the law the doctor added he also said 
he hoped new legislation would result from the incident to make 
law catch up to technological advances 
in 1988 there were some 100000 technologydependent 
children through age 18 meaning they require some medical device 
to keep them alive not always in hospitals according to the 
national association of childrens hospitals and related 
institutions of alexandria va 
susan maher said she can identify with linares her daughter 
elizabeth spent the first two years of her life at the university 
of illinois hospital in chicago the victim of cerebral palsy and 
chronic lung disease ms maher says there were times she 
considered unplugging elizabeths lifesupport equipment 
a lot of times there is hardly anybody else in the hospital 
unit she said you could do it it enters your mind when you 
feel youre being selfish by making a child suffer 
ms maher didnt do it and elizabeth now 7 lives with the aid 
of a ventilator 
cynthia kramer of calumet city lost her 13yearold son david 
to leukemia last december 
david had developed a lung infection and was on a respirator 
and the hospital asked his parents on christmas eve to give 
permission to let him die 
his dad and i said we wanted everything to stay on until 
davids very last heartbeat we didnt want to play god said 
ms kramer when god says come on thats when you come on he 
died on christmas day 
unlike lenares comatose baby she said david was dignified 
and he was brave and he was a fighter and he was an alert 
intelligent person you dont think about doing that to a person 
like that

afghan guerrillas claimed sunday that 
they destroyed four airplanes and a helicopter in a rocket attack 
on an air force base 30 miles outside afghanistans capital kabul 
it brings to eight the number of aircraft the insurgents claim 
to have destroyed at the bagram base since april 21 
the guerrillarun afghan news agency said the latest attack 
occurred thursday the 11th anniversary of the coup that brought 
the communists to power in afghanistan guerrillas have been 
fighting since then to topple the communists 
there was no independent confirmation of their claims 
rebel sources reported heavy fighting north of kabul in addition 
to the eastern provinces of nangarhar paktia and kandahar 
albunyan a news service of fundamentalist guerrilla leader 
abdul rasul sayyaf said guerrillas have killed 40 government 
troops destroyed four tanks and shot down one jet in kandahar 
since april 15 
twentyfive guerrillas died and 32 were wounded during the same 
period albunyan said 
the guerrillas who are based in pakistan have said kandahar 
will be their second major offensive their first offensive on the 
city of jalalabad is at a stalemate after several weeks of 
fighting 
the jalalabad assault began three weeks after the last soviet 
forces left afghanistan the red army intervened militarily in 
december 1979 to help fight the guerrillas but agreed to pull out 
by feb 15 under a unmoderated accord 
the afghan news agency said government forces at jalalabad have 
begun shifting their families to kabul 70 miles to the west to 
escape the rebel onslaught 
the capture of jalalabad would give the rebels a badly needed 
victory in their struggle to establish an islamic republic and a 
crucial urban foothold for an assault on kabul

boston harbor is getting cleaner but state 
officials say thats in spite of footdragging by the man who made 
its filth famous george bush 
bush sailed in during the presidential campaign last september 
and accused gov michael dukakis of neglecting an important 
environmental issue in his own state 
now the governor and his top environmental aides are wondering 
when president bush will put his money where his mouth was they 
want the 59 million recommended for the harbor cleanup by congress 
but deleted from bushs budget 
its hypocritical of the president to come to new england in 
the heat of a campaign and fault the man who began the harbor 
cleanup for not doing enough and then once safely ensconsed in the 
white house to pull the money off the table complained john 
devillars state environmental secretary 
bush last fall staged a bold raid into dukakis territory aboard 
a boat and accused dukakis of delays that left the harbor dirtier 
and dirtier the governor and his supporters scrambled to line up 
testimonials about his efforts in 1984 to create the water 
authority and give it the clout to end the pollution but as often 
happened in the campaign dukakis was put on the defensive 
by all accounts the harbor is finally getting cleaner after 350 
years of abuse and decisions have been made on where to locate a 
new 61 billion sewage treatment plant the biggest public works 
project in the regions history 
since february the agency responsible for the cleanup the 
massachusetts water resources authority has eliminated discharge 
of floating scum the grease solids and buoyant plastics that 
figured in a bush campaign commercial 
thousands of gallons a day were being discharged for the last 
hundred years that has stopped for the first time in history 
said paul levy head of the agency 
the federal judge overseeing the cleanup is satisfied with the 
pace and even the republican regional administrator of the 
environmental protection agency michael deland agrees overall 
i am delighted with the progress and am optimistic the dates are 
going to be met he said 
still the harbor water is so foul that according to levy if 
you scoop up a bucketful and pour it back in you would be 
violating the clean water act 
without federal funds the full cost of the cleanup falls on the 
water authoritys 25 million customers who have seen water and 
sewer bills rising by 20 percent a year 
i think the thing that concerns us particularly is after all 
the talk about boston harbor the president eliminated funds the 
congress had already appropriated for the harbor dukakis said in 
an interview last week 
deland defended the presidents budget decision citing the 
deficit and claiming that massachusetts congressmen were divided 
over whether to release the money because they cannot agree on 
where to put a sludge processing plant 
in my view from a national perspective given the deficit 
situation one has to raise a question why a bonus for boston 
deland said besides he argued massachusetts could have applied 
for aid years ago when federal funds were plentiful but chose to 
seek a pollution waiver instead 
bush meanwhile has become enmeshed in a pollution controversy 
of his own the alaskan oil spill dukakis declined to comment on 
the presidents response to the spill but top aides note bitterly 
that bush who said i am an environmentalist during the 
campaign hesitated in committing federal resources 
im sure these are all oversights levy said sarcastically 
but some of us are struck by the inconsistency

nasa on sunday began replacing two 
faulty fuelsystem parts aboard space shuttle atlantis in hope of 
making another launch attempt as early as friday 
the launch of the shuttle and its 550 million magellan venus 
probe was scrubbed on friday 31 seconds before liftoff because of a 
power surge on a pump that recirculates liquid hydrogen fuel for 
one of the shuttles three main engines 
engineers later discovered a pinhole leak in a fuel line that 
carries hydrogen from the external fuel tank to the shuttle 
nasa officials sunday said they would not set a new launch date 
until monday but they said liftoff could not occur before friday 
afternoon 
because of the positions of earth and venus there is only a 
32day launch opportunity window for sending the magellan 
spacecraft toward venus 
if the shuttle cant get off the ground by may 28 the mission 
will have to be put off for two years at a cost of more than 100 
million until earth and venus are again in proper alignment 
nasa spokeswoman lisa malone said workers were removing foam 
insulation from around both the pump and the hydrogen line and 
hoped to have a new pump and a new line installed by mondayy 
after the parts have passed pressure electrical and other 
tests nasa would be ready to restart the countdown which lasts 
two days 
right now we dont know when we will pick up the count 
malone said but we feel comfortable with what we are doing 
had the countdown continued on friday a computer to detect such 
problems as fuelline leaks would have stopped the engines from 
firing and the five astronauts would have been safe the space 
agency said 
shuttle commander david walker and pilot ronald grabe practiced 
shuttle landings in a training aircraft sunday and then flew to 
their home base in houston mission specialists mary cleave mark 
lee and norman thagard returned to houston on saturday 
before returning for another launch attempt the astronauts will 
keep sharp by rehearsing in a simulator 
six hours after launch the astronauts are to release the 
magellan from atlantis cargo bay propelling it on a 450day 
journey to venus the 7600pound craft is to orbit the planet and 
map up to 90 percent of its cloudveiled surface with 
highresolution radar 
the images relayed to earth could tell scientists much about the 
history of venus and why it evolved so differently from earth

a founder of zimbabwes ruling party 
sunday launched a new opposition political movement with the avowed 
aim of preventing a dictatorship 
edgar tekere 52 said the president leadership was decayed 
and he vowed to challenge president robert mugabe as head of state 
in the next elections which are due before april 1990 
we are going to pursue one another right up to the 
presidential election tekere chairman of the newly formed 
zimbabwe unity movement told a news conference 
tekere who helped mugabe establish the ruling zimbabwe african 
national union party in 1963 was fired from the 15member 
politburo and 90strong central committee in october after lashing

weaving a personality cult around the head of state 
im in for a war with the ruling party tekere said as he 
unveiled his movements emblem a black a brown and a white hand 
clasped together the election battle lines are drawn 
tekere admitted that the party has yet to be registered but he

mugabe led the whiteruled british colony of rhodesia to 
independence as blackgoverned zimbabwe on april 18 1980 he has 
said tekere was welcome to start his own political party 
tekere said there was an urgent need for a new party because the 
ruling partys leadership was throughly decayed the rigidly 
controlled socialist orientated economy was close to the point of 
total collapse unemployment was out of control and most of the 9 
million zimbabweans had lost respect for their government 
tekere also expressed concern that mugabe would go ahead next 
year with his avowed aim of establishing a oneparty system in 
zimbabwe one of africas few democracies

ruling party and all other opposition parties regardless of their 
race tribe religion or sex to join the movement before a congress 
approves a constitution and elects leaders before the end of the 
year

alaska environmental officials said sunday 
they are frustrated by the pace of oil spill cleanup efforts in 
prince william sound and are pressuring exxon to be more aggressive 
at the same time a newspaper reported that a company exxon 
hired for the cleanup is scaling back its work force at seward 
outside the sound 
the giant oil company has promised to clean more than 300 miles 
of shoreline in the sound by sept 15 but some people are 
skeptical 
monday is exxons deadline for providing the state with a plan 
for waste disposal and cleaning of gulf of alaska shorelines hit by 
the drifting oil 
the 987foot tanker exxon valdez rammed bligh reef on march 24 
spilling nearly 11 million gallons of heavy north slope crude oil 
as fishermen prepared for their upcoming seasons and migrating 
animals and birds headed into the sound 
colleen burgh shoreline cleanup coordinator for the alaska 
department of environmental conservation said the company should 
be experimenting with new cleanup techniques and bringing them to 
the state for evaluation 
we get the impression they are sitting back and waiting for us 
to tell them which method to use she said sunday theyve been 
working two weeks and they dont even have a mile clean 
theyve got to get more aggressive if theyre going to get the 
job done said burgh 
asked if she was skeptical exxon could meet its sept 15 
deadline burgh said that using the methods ive seen to date 
id have to say yes 
in a letter to exxon the state said the company should examine 
all cleanup methods and let state and federal agencies decide 
whether they should be used burgh said she could envision use of 
bulldozers to redo the contours of beaches in some cases 
the state letter was addressed to andy teal part of exxons 
shoreline advisory panel he said his company was working to make 
the cleanup more efficient and had been talking with state 
officials 
weve had a number of discussions as to enhancing the 
operations out there teal said that letter came as a bit of a 
surprise to me those discussions were already taking place 
he said the company was bringing in new equipment for trials 
during the weekend crews on smith island experimented with the use 
of increased water temperatures to remove oil he said 
meanwhile the anchorage daily news reported the oilfield 
services company exxon hired to carry out the cleanup is scaling 
back its work force at seward because of selfproclaimed success in 
saving resurrection bay outside prince william sound and opening 
onto the gulf of alaska on the eastern end of the kenai peninsula 
plans called for about 100 workers in seward to be put on 
rotating schedules sunday working one week and taking the next off 
without pay the scheduling change by veco international inc will 
halve the number of people on the job on any day the newspaper 
said 
we are not laying off anyone were putting them on 
rotation said ron rolan general supervisor of vecos seward 
operations 
exxon has said that by midsummer as many as 4000 people will be 
hired to scrub oiled shores 
work crews in prince william sound mostly have been plugging 
away on naked smith and seal islands using methods that include 
wiping oil off rocks by hand flushing beaches with cold salt water 
and blasting oil with hot water 
on heavily oiled smith island workers have been inching their 
way down a boulderstrewn shore toward an area seals use for 
pupping 
the cold water even at high pressure cannot get the oil 
up said bill lamoreaux the state cleanup coordinator you 
have to change methods as you go 
the state estimates smith island has three miles of heavily 
oiled shoreline and a halfmile of beach with moderate oil 
contamination 
there are more than 30 other islands on the cleanup list some 
with more than 50 miles of heavily oiled shoreline 
burgh said none of smith islands shoreline has been cleaned to 
the states satisfaction theres an incredible amount of oil on 
smith island theyre going to be there for a while

transport planes sunday 
repatriated thousands of refugees between senegal and mauritania in 
an effort to halt violence between people of the neighboring 
nations 
on sunday 12 mauritanians were killed in touba 125 miles east 
of dakar senegal sources said there were no reports of 
antisenegalese attacks in mauritania 
the sporadic violence against expatriate senegalese and 
mauritanian communities in both countries began last month in a 
dispute over border land between the two west african nations more 
than 200 people are thought to have died in the fighting 
a dusktodawn curfew declared tuesday in nouakchott remained in 
effect but in dakar a 10 pm to 6 am curfew failed to stop 
scattered pillaging of mauritanian shops 
french spanish and morrocan planes carried 5000 refugees 
between the capitals on sunday officials said on condition of 
anonymity a total of 3000 senegalese and 5000 mauritanians have 
been repatriated since the airlifts began late saturday officials 
said 
an estimated 20000 mauritanians were being held under army 
protection at a fairground outside dakar awaiting a flight home 
about 60007000 senegalese were harbored by the mauritanian red 
crescent at a nouakchott mosque and an exhibition hall 
nouakchott airport surrounded by soldiers and armored vehicles 
became a virtual military base as civilian and military planes 
loaded senegalese for the trip home lines of refugees could be 
seen walking under military escort to one of six moroccan planes 
sunday 
at the fairground in dakar customs officials and police 
confiscated everything from knives to money and jewels from 
mauritanians preparing to depart according to agence 
francepresse customs officers told the french news agency they 
were ordered to do so and said senegalese leaving mauritania were 
getting the same treatment 
senegal president abdou diouf appealed late saturday for calm 
despite what he called the inhuman and degrading treatment of 
senegalese citizens in mauritania that was an apparent reference 
to a twoday bloody outburst on tuesday and wednesday in which 
senegalese were said to have been mutilated by mauritanians 
diouf in a radio and television broadcast said mauritania 
sparked the spiraling violence which began april 9 when two 
senegalese were killed in a border dispute over grazing land

gov michael s dukakis announced new 
antiacidrain rules billed as the toughest in the nation making 
good a 1985 vow to implement instate regulation if the federal 
government failed to act 
the governor made his announcement saturday at houghtons pond 
one of hundreds of massachusetts bodies of water threatened by acid 
rain new state emissions limits will take effect at the end of 
1994 but plans for meeting them must be submitted by jan 1 1991 
we are hoping our action will encourage congress to adopt a 
tough set of national standards and will encourage other states to 
take similar action he said in a statement the future of our 
lakes our forests and our natural resources depend on it 
new hampshire new york and wisconsin are among several states 
that have already implemented acid rain regulations but none has 
as yet mandated controls as stringent as those for massachusetts 
officials said 
acid rain is caused by combustion of fossil fuels in power 
plants and motor vehicles which release sulfur and nitrogren 
oxides into the air 
about 25 percent of acid rain in massachusetts comes from 
instate sources with the remainder coming from the midwest and 
other sources according to government figures 
the new program includes limits on sulphur dioxide emissions 
from 168 factories and power plants in massachusetts 
officials predict it should result in an annual reduction of 
between 68000 and 87000 tons of sulphur dioxide emissions about 
a 20 percent to 25 percent cut in the 370000 tons of sulphur 
dioxide currently emmitted from all sources in massachusetts 
the program gives companies several options in reducing 
pollution they can conserve energy switch to natural gas or 
cleaner fuels or earn credits by making greater reductions in one 
part of their operation while leaving another part dirtier than 
otherwise allowed 
studies have shown 185 massachusetts rivers ponds and streams 
are already acidified and 800 more bodies of water will be affected 
in the next 40 years unless action is taken to curb emissions 
officials said 
environmentalists hailed the new regulations 
this represents a landmark victory for the environment and 
public health said jenny carter environmental attorney for the 
massachusetts public interest research group 
a spokesman for boston edison co one of the states largest 
utilities said the impact the new restrictions was not yet clear 
we knew it was coming down but its a little too early to 
assess the impact on edison bill connolly said well have to 
wait and see

violence from opponents of expanded fishing 
rights for indians will not be allowed an official warned sunday 
following seven arrests as crowds gathered to throw rocks and taunt 
spearfishers 
we wont tolerate any type of physical abuse like rock 
throwing department of natural resources spokesman john nelson 
said we have been tolerating the verbal stuff because people 
have a right to their opinion but that does not extend to the area 
of physical violence 
police in riot gear have patrolled boat landings on the northern 
lakes where chippewa indians are spearfishing under the guarantee 
of 19th century treaties through saturday 67 demonstrators had 
been arrested since the tribal fishing season began april 23 
the seven arrested saturday night included four accused of 
rockthrowing at north twin lake where a crowd estimated at 1000 
people gathered in light snow no injuries were reported 
nelson said protesters have thrown rocks in isolated incidents 
in the past but never to the degree that occurred saturday night 
crowds of more than 100 people have gathered at many lakes at 
night when chippewa fishermen use lights and multipronged spears to 
take walleyed pike and other fish from northern wisconsin lakes 
it is the fifth year that wisconsins six chippewa bands have 
spearfished since a federal court ruled the tribe retained the 
right to gather food off reservation under treaties that ceded much 
of northern wisconsin to the federal government 
treaty rights opponents object to rules that allow tribal 
fishermen different fishing methods and seasons than nonindian 
sportsmen the critics particularly oppose the spears which are 
more efficient than the traditional rod and reel 
in boulder junction on saturday gov tommy g thompson told 
business leaders and treaty rights opponents hell do everything 
possible to reduce the suffering and turmoil over indian 
spearfishing 
i know every one of you are completely upset thompson said 
youre very emotional so am i and im very sorry about the 
situation 
the governor unveiled a multimilliondollar plan to boost 
northern wisconsin tourism and address business concerns about the 
economic effects of spearfishing including efforts to stock more 
pike in northern lakes and to press for a compromise with the 
chippewa 
in the disturbance at north twin lake about 30 rocks showered 
from the crowd saturday night as one of eight tribal boats entered 
the water said george meyer a natural resources department 
administrator 
most arrests were for disorderly conduct but one protester who 
was on the lake with a boat was arrested on charges he harassed a 
spearer by creating a hazardous wake nelson said

people from across the nation have expressed outrage that walt 
disney productions ordered the daycare center to remove paintings 
of mickey and minnie mouse donald duck and goofy from the outside

support for the daycare center has come from a phoenix ariz 
grandmother a new york doctor a mississippi beauty shop owner and 
the creator of a saturday morning cartoon television show an 
official said 
ive gotten so many telephone calls from people angry at 
disney that i bet walt disney is turning over in his grave right 
now said erica scotti executive director of the very important 
babies daycare 
disney officials said the school is violating copyright laws and 
they want the popular cartoons removed in one month the company 
also has ordered the characters removed at two other hallandale 
daycare centers good godmothers daycare and temple messianique 
the calls have been from people who apparently dont 
understand the american copyright said disney spokesman chuck 
champlin he expressed concern that the public would think the

similar suit against 75 merchants in the chicago area 
the suit filed thursday accuses disney with unauthorized use of 
the brown derby name at the disneymgm studios theme park 
disneys signature eatery at the studios theme park the 
hollywood brown derby opens at disneys new attraction monday 
disney claims its restaurant pays homage to the famous eatery once 
located at hollywood and vine streets and has nothing to do with 
the chain 
the suit filed in us district court in orlando seeks 25 
million in damages in burbank calif disney spokesman tom deegan 
said it is disney policy not to comment on lawsuits 
it surprises me said brown derby inc lawyer david 
rosenzweig that a company that reveres and recognizes the 
importance of its trademarks would do this but i suppose it 
happens 
rosenzweig said the cleveland company has used the brown derby 
name at its restaurants across the nation for more than 50 years 
he said the name has been on the chains restaurants in florida for 
more than 15 years 
rosenzweig did acknowledge there has never been a connection 
between brown derby inc and the original brown derby restaurant 
a hollywood calif landmark in the 1930s and 1940s 
in an unrelated case disney filed its own suit wednesday 
charging the 75 chicagoarea merchants were selling merchandise 
bearing the unauthorized likenesses of mickey and minnie mouse 
goofy and roger rabbit 
on march 31 disney sued the academy of motion picture arts and 
sciences on march 31 charging that the academy used disneys snow 
white character without permission at its annual academy awards 
show the academy apologized and promised not to use the characters 
again without disneys permission and the suit was dropped

the shoreham nuclear power plant is about to 
have its plug pulled without generating a usable kilowatt for long 
island but that didnt stop the nuclear regulatory commission from 
giving an operating license to the controversial reactor 
the commission acted with full knowledge the long island 
lighting co is hoping to rid itself of the 55 billion albatross 
in exchange for lifesustaining rate hikes and a 
multibilliondollar tax writeoff 
some industrywatchers have called awarding the license the 
nrcs last best attempt to salvage anything from a plant whose 
name connotes everything cited as going wrong with the nuclear 
power industry construction delays fraud huge cost overruns 
safety problems and endless federal red tape 
others hailed it as evidence of a pumpedup nrc which backed 
by the new administration will shepherd in a new nuclear age 
and some said it was an attempt by the nrc to deflect pointing 
fingers when shoreham is laid to rest and long islanders experience 
their next brownout 
i think the nrc did not want to be blamed for having a corpse 
on its own doorstep said james schlesinger energy secretary in 
the carter administration now an analyst at the center for 
strategic and international studies 
nrc chairman lando zech has declined to interpret the 
commissions action or to concede that shorehams license may have 
been the culmination of a long expensive and ultimately academic 
exercise 
we have acted in my view very responsibly zech said april 
20 after the commission voted 40 to award the license we 
wouldnt authorize it to operate if we didnt think it could 
operate and if we didnt think it could operate safely 
shorehams orchestrated demise cannot be completed until lilco 
shareholders sign the death warrant which they are expected to do 
in a vote sometime in midjune last year the shareholders 
approved a buyout but that deal crumbled when the state 
legislature refused to do likewise by a dec 1 deadline 
the next step will be for a state agency to buy the plant for a 
symbolic dollar and the new york power authority would oversee its 
decommissioning and dismantling in return lilco gets annual rate 
hikes of approximately 5 percent for a decade keeping the utility 
afloat and guaranteeing long island the highest electric rates in 
the country 
but zech has intimated that the transfer of shorehams license 
may not be a foregone conclusion saying the action would be a 
very formal process complete with hearings and public comment 
one government agency expected to offer its opinion is the 
department of energy which lately has been threatening to create 
roadblocks to the transfer 
however schlesinger said the current energy secretary james 
watkins has no power to stop it 
he can register his views with the nrc but i think the nrc 
appears to have charted its course schlesinger said 
peter bradford new york public service commission chairman and 
former chairman of the nrc also discounted does clout in the 
shoreham case 
indisputably the shoreham case and similar problems at the 
seabrook nh plant drove the nrc to reclaim powers it had 
sacrificed to the states after the accident at three mile island on 
march 28 1979 
when the state and local governments blocked the shoreham and 
seabrook licenses by refusing to participate in emergency planning 
the nrc changed its regulations thus shoreham is the first plant 
to be licensed based on a utilitycreated evacuation plan which 
assumes that in the event of an emergency state and local 
authorities will cooperate 
the nrc also streamlined the process for getting a reactor built 
and started passing a regulation that would allow the nrc to award 
an operating license at the same time as it approves plant 
construction part of that ruling also calls for the 
standardization of plant design 
but no utility has ordered a nuclear plant since 1978 and all 
those ordered after 1974 have been canceled 
those rule changes are a complete waste of time said 
bradford nuclear powers fundamental problem right now is that 
it just cant compete economically with the other supply sources 
and conservation and in the bidding systems that more and more 
states are looking to screen their power supply in the future 
but loring mills vice president for nuclear activity at the 
edison electric institute a utilities trade association predicted 
a nuclear renaissance with the next nuclear plant order coming 
sometime between 1994 and 1999 
kenneth alvin solomon a nuclear scientist with the rand corp 
a californiabased think tank predicted a turnaround in the 
nuclear industry hopefully in my lifetime 
the alternatives to nuclear reactors are not necessarily all 
that attractive all the time he said oil plants coal plants 
have pollution oil is something that we have to depend on other 
countries for so theres a whole series of reasons that i see the 
picture getting better

reports of taintings with glass shards pieces of razor blades

heinz or cow and gate baby food but several were in other brands 
police said most of the reports of contamination were mistakes 
hoaxes or copycat crimes scotland yard which is coordinating the 
national inquiry said several arrests have been made 
two cases one involving caustic soda and another involving 
broken razor blades have been tied to an extortionist who demanded 
up to 17 million from the pittsburghbased hj heinz co police 
said 
john aspery a british spokesman for heinz said the company has 
confirmed five cases of contamination all involving glass jars 
two of them are the work of the extortionist he said 
heinz and cow and gate are the topselling brands of baby food 
in britain 
officials at heinz say their company sells 80 million jars and 
90 million cans of baby food in britain each year aspery said the 
contamination scare had cost heinz a considerable amount in 
lost sales but he said the exact amount was still being calculated 
heinz has announced it is destroying its stock and introducing 
new tamperproof packaging as soon as possible 
tesco withdrew jars and cans of heinz and cow and gate baby food 
from its shelves friday it said it checked them all and found them 
intact 
the contamination scare has spread to the united states where 
three grocery stores in springfield ill removed heinz baby food 
products from their shelves after a woman reported finding straight 
pins in jars of the food 
heinz spokesman harry carroll said it was an isolated incident 
police said it could be the work of a copycat provoked by 
reports of the british scare

americans marked 200 years of the presidency 
sunday with a reenactment of george washingtons inauguration a 
tribute from his 40th successor prayers for a few more stable 
centuries and of course a parade 
it was washingtons vision his balance his integrity that 
made the presidency possible president bush told a crowd outside 
federal hall national memorial in lower manhattan after actors 
reenacted the first presidents inauguration in 1789 the building 
is an 1842 structure on the site of the original hall 
as he finished his speech hundreds of red white and blue 
balloons were released into the sky from behind federal hall and 
multicolored confetti streamers and even flowers rained down from 
30 stories up in neighboring skyscrapers 
bush earlier prayed in washingtons pew and stood beside a 
washington standin during the reenactment of the oathtaking 
which climaxed a week of festivities in new york from fireworks to 
symposiums and in a sense ended 13 years of bicentennial bashes 
that began in 1976 
after the ceremony bush and the first lady barbara briefly 
took their place in an inaugural parade but headed off to the 
heliport at the end of wall street 
that left the parade to the other george as portrayed by actor 
william sommerfield who gestured grandly to the crowds that lined 
broadway 
the parade was a thumping blaring stream of military bands 
fife and drum corps and marchers in colonial dress bands from all 
four military service branches marched a first organizers said 
along with a police bagpipe band and a kazoo band 
its so easy to take for granted that we have a democracy 
said one of the onlookers chris mccarthy 29 of new york 
something like this drives home the fact that weve had it for so 
long 
there is a sense of history the constitution lives said 
joan marshalldutcher of king of prussia pa whose husband david 
dutcher played washingtons aide in the reenactment 
the day began with a service at st pauls chapel of trinity 
church where the bushes sat in the pew used by washington after 
his inauguration held when new york city was the nations capital 
in his sermon episcopal bishop paul moore reflected on the 
nations future as well as its past 
it was a review of the events that got us here but also about 
the people left out those with aids or crippled by poverty and 
ignorance for example said sen frank lautenberg dnj it 
was very moving 
a huge stadiumstyle television screen alongside the red white 
and blue platform gave viewers closeups of the ceremony in which 
sommerfield as washington solemnly took the oath of office 
laying his hand on the same bible used in 1789 
sommerfield then delivered excerpts from washingtons inaugural 
address which in reality was not spoken to the crowd but to 
congress inside the hall 
sundays clear weather contrasted to the heavy overcast 
saturday when smallish crowds watched a flotilla of ships in the 
afternoon including the aircraft carrier uss forrestal and 
partially foggedin fireworks at night

president bush on sunday retraced the inaugural 
steps of another president named george who took the oath two 
centuries ago that cemented him in history as the father of our 
country 
participating in celebrations of the 200th anniversary of george 
washingtons inauguration as the first us president bush said 
his forbearer established a precedent for 40 presidents to 
follow 
it was washingtons vision his balance his integrity that 
made the presidency possible bush told a gathering outside the 
federal hall national memorial an 1842 structure built on the site 
of the original hall where washington was sworn in on april 30 
1789 
the 41st president reflected on the awesome prospect that 
faced washington on that day 
how unlikely it must have seemed then that we might become 
united states how uncertain that a republic could be hewn out of 
the wilderness of competing interests bush said but george 
washington defined and shaped this office 
bush said washington created a living functioning 
government based on the constitution he brought together men 
of genius a team of giants with strong and competing views he 
harnessed and directed their energies 
on a day awash with historical symbolism bush sat in the church 
pew where washington prayed on that first inauguration day trod 
the steps of federal hall where the first president took his oath 
and waved goodbye to an actor recreating the departure of a newly 
inaugurated president washington 
the ceremony ended with a rain of brightly colored confetti and 
fresh carnations cascading from nearby office towers onto the crowd 
speaking to a crowd of several thousand people from behind a 
glass wall on the federal hall steps bush seemed not to notice a 
handful of protesters who waved signs reading we demand health 
care and chanted 100 days and nothing done what about aids 
bush spoke of washingtons dedication to service and repeated 
his own oftenstated call for americans to follow that calling 
today 
today we seek a new engagement in the lives of others 
believing that success is not measured by the sum of our 
possessions our positions or our professions but by the good we 
do for others he said 
bush and his wife barbara joined by their daughter doro leblond 
and bushs brother jonathan bush began their day in new york with 
church services at st pauls chapel where washington attended 
services on his inauguration day 
the episcopal service which featured several hymns and readings 
and ended with the singing of america the beautiful was 
attended by about 250 people 
at the corner of wall and broad streets where federal hall is 
dwarfed by the financial districts skyscrapers bush was joined at 
the podium by new york mayor ed koch and the states us senators 
daniel patrick moynihan and alfonse damato and by former 
supreme court chief justice warren burger 
koch a democrat remarked on the name shared by the first 
president and the current republican resident of the white house 
from george to george theres no one like george he said 
moynihan commenting on the move of the national capital from 
new york to washington noted that washington at the time was 
mostly a swamp along the potomac river 
but joked moynihan malaria had a calming influence on the 
city of washington 
the ceremony attended by bush included a enactment of 
washingtons swearing in by actors in colonial costume standing in 
front of the large statue of washington on the federal hall steps 
george washington rode up in a horse drawn carriage 
recreating the first presidents arrival after a weeklong journey 
from his home at mount vernon va on the potomac river 
after the actor recited washingtons oath of office and made 
brief comments he strode grandly to a waiting carriage doffing his 
threecorner hat to the crowd the bushes cheerily waved goodbye as 
his carriage drove off 
other bicentennial activities that did not include 
participation by bush were a boat flotilla in new york harbor a 
fireworks display saturday night and a presidents ball sunday

city officials plan to broaden an 
investigation into mayor tom bradleys financial dealings and his 
ties to a cityfunded task force that hired his daughter 
newspapers reported sunday 
investigators have interviewed some city officials as many as 
eight times about the newly reelected mayors links to far east 
national bank and in coming weeks will examine his relationships 
with valley federal savings amp loan association and the task force 
the los angeles times reported sunday 
the newspaper cited unidentified sources in city attorney james 
hahns office 
hahn is expected to testify wednesday before the city councils 
governmental operations committee on the status of his 
investigation 
we will subpoena everyone involved if we have to said 
councilman nate holden who came close to forcing bradley into a 
runoff in the april 11 election 
bradley will not comment until hahns investigation is 
completed said bill chandler a mayoral spokesman 
during appearances saturday bradley refused to discuss 
allegations that he was paid to serve on the boards of far east and 
valley federal while they did business with the city 
the mayor also denied knowledge that his daughter phyllis 
bradley 43 was hired by the task force for africalos angeles 
relations 
i knew nothing about it had nothing to do with it bradley 
said shes entitled to conduct her own life and to seek her 
employment wherever she wishes 
bradleys daughter was a task force secretary for almost 10 
months in 1985 and 1986 said chandler 
the task force which works to improve african business and 
cultural ties with the city is headed by juanita st john with 
whom bradley has real estate investments the times said 
at least twice since 1985 bradley has intervened to ensure 
funding of about 98000 a year for the task force despite city 
council objections the los angeles herald examiner reported sunday 
hahn and reportedly the police department are also looking 
into bradleys advisory work for far east which earned him 18000 
far east president henry hwang told the los angeles times in an 
interview friday that bradley was the only one of 46 bank advisory 
board members who was paid he said bradley was considered helpful 
to the bank on foreign trade issues 
bradley has denied knowing that the bank was doing business with 
the city at the time he served as a consultant 
the mayor who resigned from the advisory board last december 
said he was unaware of the banks municipal ties until the issue 
was raised during his reelection campaign last month he has since 
returned the 18000 
but court documents indicated he made at least two inquiries to 
city departments on behalf of the bank last year 
bradley also received at least 150000 while serving on the 
board of directors of valley federal savings amp loan association

george bushs administration has just begun but 
texas universities and his alma mater yale already are squaring 
off for the chance to be the home of his presidential library 
it has the trappings of any good political fight cities 
battling for prestige and a piece of history not to mention 
revenues from an estimated 400000 annual tourists in bushs case 
the battle is all the more interesting since he has divided 
loyalties and familial ties 
bush was born in massachusetts and educated in connecticut but 
has claimed texas as home for more than 40 years that opens the 
bidding among several of texas finest and bushs ivy league alma 
mater yale 
hes spoken on the campus many times we just feel that this 
is very much a part of his home said mimi crossley a 
spokeswoman for rice university in houston bush has had a long 
history of involvement with rice she said mentioning a 
onesemester teaching job he held in 1978 and friendship he has 
with rice officials and supporters 
besides she said rice promotes its academic excellence only 
fitting for a presidents papers 
but so does yale 
jack siggins yales deputy librarian said that about four 
years ago a yale professor contacted thenvice president bush about 
donating his papers to the new haven conn school where bush 
graduated in 1948 he didnt make a commitment siggins said 
shortly after the november election yale repeated its offer 
and the texas universities chimed in both rice and university of 
houston representatives have written letters to bush about being 
the library site but texas aampm is mounting the most ambitious 
offensive 
aampm grad michel halbouty a longtime bush friend broached the 
matter to bush after the election and last week aampm announced a 
detailed battle plan to capture the library including a steering 
committee to prepare the bid and the enlistment of graduate 
students to help design the building 
im flattered at aampms interest and it may be what i want to 
do bush recently told newsweek the idea has great appeal to 
me 
but he also cited rice as a logical location at any rate 
he said its a little premature but i want texas to be the 
recipient 
both rice and houston are touting their houston location over 
the aampm aggies site at college station about 80 miles northwest of 
houston but aampm officials say college station lies equidistant 
from several metropolitan areas which would allow it to draw at 
least 500000 visitors a year 
william mckenzie chairman of aampms board of regents made 
another point saying in a news release that texas aampm is 
philisophically compatible with the conservative bush 
back east yale isnt sitting on its hands siggins said the 
university will quietly pursue the bush library with the force of 
persuasive logic 
among other selling points yale has a region in which bushs 
family goes back for centuries impressive collections and scholars 
and experience at finding donations 
let me just say that theres a lot of time a lot of things 
can happen siggins said you never can tell

stonethrowing three months after he was arrested and held without 
bail 
puerto ricoborn mansour abed alsamad stood before a threeman 
military tribunal and denied charges that on jan 23 he helped 
erect roadblocks and threw stones at an israeli army patrol in the 
west bank village of surda 13 miles north of jerusalem 
the troops shot in the air and chased after the youth no one 
was wounded in the incident and only samad was caught by the 
soldiers

sundays hearing was the first time samad appeared in court 
since his arrest three months ago he received two trial dates in 
march but the army failed to bring him to the court giving no 
explanation

treatment because of his us citizenship 
a representative from the us consulate in jerusalem visited 
samad while he was imprisoned and a consular official was present 
at the trial

burst into tears and his sixyearold brother ran towards him to 
hug him the soldiers stood aside for a few minutes before 
escorting samad to the prisoners dock 
samad pleaded not guilty to the charges against him he said he 
was walking to the market when the incident occured and was 
arrested by soldiers who mistakenly thought he was involved in the 
stonethrowing 
the verdict and sentencing are both expected this thursday

samad was born in puerto rico and moved with his mother to her 
native village of surda in 1983

federal prosecutors have dropped a grand jury 
investigation into whether pioneering transplant surgeon thomas 
starzl gave highpaying foreigners preferential treatment at two 
hospitals here 
the justice department told the philadelphia office of the us 
department of health and human services in a letter friday that 
investigators had decided not to bring a case against starzl said 
judy holtz spokeswoman for the social agencys inspector generals 
office 
we have no other comment she said 
the investigation which lasted nearly three years followed a 
pulitzer prizewinning series of reports by the pittsburgh press on 
transplants by surgical teams headed by starzl 
starzl the chief of transplantation at the university of 
pittsburgh school of medicine and head of transplant programs at 
presbyterianuniversity and childrens hospitals said his 
reputation and that of the hospitals had been cleared 
its just a clean bill of health he said 
however the surgeon said he did not feel vindicated by the 
governments action i never really felt beleaguered by the whole 
thing because i knew the stories werent true he said 
madelyn ross managing editor of the pittsburgh press defended 
the newspapers series 
its not a newspapers job to determine criminality thats 
somebody elses job like the us attorney and i cant speak for 
what his investigation turned up 
but i can speak for what the pittsburgh press research showed 
and it showed a clear and demonstrable inequity in the transplant 
system we stand by that information 
according to the newspapers 1985 report medical records showed 
that about 28 percent of the transplants by starzls team from 
january 1984 to may 1985 were for foreigners who often were not as 
ill or had not waited as long as other patients on waiting lists 
the press found that foreigners who received kidneys paid four 
times more in surgeons fees than americans who got the same 
operations 
the federal grand jury began taking secret testimony in august 
1986 
health and human services inspector general richard kusserow had 
asked officials to investigate whether a pittsburgh center violated 
the national organ transplant act which prohibits selling organs 
for profit 
kusserow had not named which hospital or surgeon was being 
investigated until friday 
in its transplant series the press said the starzl team 
bypassed hospital policy to ensure that foreign patients received 
kidney transplants quickly 
the policy said donor organs should go to locals first 
hardtomatch patients second and then foreign nationals former 
chief of surgery dr henry bahnson told the newspaper in 1985 
following the newspapers report transplant surgeons under

two cabinet ministers demanded sunday that 
jewish settlers be allowed to shoot more freely in clashes with 
palestinians and arab reports said a settler shot a 10yearold 
girl in the head as protesters stoned his car 
the palestinian youngster the second reportedly shot by 
settlers in the last three days was hospitalized in fair condition 
in the west bank town of el bireh the israeliappointed mayor 
said he was withdrawing his resignation after being asked to do so 
by the military government 
hassan tawil 72 resigned saturday after arsonists set the door 
of his house on fire he also had been stabbed and wounded in the 
chest by a palestinian on june 7 
proplo leaders of the 14monthold palestinian uprising have 
repeatedly urged israeliappointed officials to resign at least 40 
palestinians alleged to have collaborated with israel are among the 
arab victims of the uprising 
the violence which began in dec 1987 has killed 456 
palestinians and 18 israelis 
the increasing tensions between palestinians and settlers in the 
occupied territories was debated sunday by the cabinet defense 
minister yitzhak rabin rejected calls that settlers be allowed 
freer use of firearms 
but rabin also warned the army may have to take harsher measures 
against palestinians unless they accept prime minister yitzhak 
shamirs offer of elections in the occupied territories as a step 
toward ending the uprising 
whoever will oppose the idea of elections will force us to 
realize that theres no chance to sit around the negotiating table 
therefore we will have to use more force to put down the violence 
in the territories rabin told reporters 
avner shaki of the national religious party a cabinet minister 
without portfolio and transport minister moshe katzav of shamirs 
rightwing likud bloc demanded that settlers be allowed to fire 
weapons whenever they are the target of stonings 
a rock should be seen as a weapon like a firebomb a knife a 
bullet or a bomb the people of the uprising see rocks as a way of 
clearing us out of the occupied territories shaki told israel 
television he proposed that israel create a settler police 
but rabin and other ministers rejected changing selfdefense 
rules which allow settlers to fire at stonethrowers only in 
lifethreatening situations 
they have all the right to defend themselves but they 
dont have and will not have responsibility for imposing law and 
order in the territories rabin said 
the cabinet debate followed the arrest saturday of a 52yearold 
jewish settler from kiryat arba in the west bank in the fatal 
shooting of a 14yearold palestinian boy in nearby hebron 
the settler chaim benlulu said he fired into the air friday 
to free himself from several dozen arab youths who ambushed his car 
with stones israeli news reports said 
benlulu brought to hebron sunday to reenact the shooting was 
stoned again along with police and troops israel radio said it 
said soldiers fired in the air to disperse the palestinians 
also in hebron a settler whose car was being stoned shot 
10yearold arij adnan natshe in the head arab reports said the 
army said it was checking the report 
the girl was in fair condition at hebrons ahli hospital an 
official there said adding that the girl appeared to have been 
shot from a distance of 200 yards 
during the night settlers demonstrated in front of military 
government headquarters in hebron to protest increased stoning 
attacks 
about 70000 jewish settlers live among the 17 million 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip 
also sunday an arab israeli doctor reportedly involved in talks 
with palestinians said israel may free some palestinian prisoners 
in exchange for an israeli soldiers body 
dr ahmed tibi said in a telephone interview from the 
palestinian side there is one body israel has to exchange 
something for this body and will do so i think 
he declined to give details but the israeli newspaper yediot 
ahronot said the body was that of samir assad a druse sergeant 
captured in april 1983 in south lebanon 
rabin denied the report and an army spokesman refused comment

the rev jesse jackson encouraged striking coal 
miners sunday to continue nonviolent civil disobedience to force 
concessions from virginias biggest coal company saying we will 
not surrender 
this is a great moment in which we have come together 
jackson told about 10000 pittston coal group workers and united 
mine workers union supporters who flooded the wise county 
fairgrounds 
the tradition of martin luther king jr and john l lewis have 
come together jackson said referring to the slain civil rights 
leader and the militant former umw president the spirit cannot 
be defeated 
the twotime democratic presidential candidate wore a camouflage 
outfit which strikers have adopted as a uniform to make themselves 
harder to identify 
about 1700 umw members went on strike april 5 against pittston 
virginias largest coal company after working without a contract 
for 14 months 
last week the strikers began blocking roads and entrances to 
mines and a coal processing plant the nonviolent strategy has led 
to 1182 arrests an impromptu rally that sealed off a downtown 
area and a walkout by 220 students at two local high schools 
umw president richard trumka on sunday promised to keep the 
strike going 
were exercising our right to strike to protect our families 
and we will not go back trumka said as rain poured onto the 
fairgrounds 
minutes later as jackson was about to speak the rain stopped 
in addition to strikers and their families the rally drew umw 
members from around the region and members of other unions about 
7000 people packed the fairgrounds and another 3000 listened to 
speeches through loudspeakers outside a few sheriffs deputies and 
state troopers monitored the rally and directed traffic 
earlier jackson addressed an overflow crowd of about 350 people 
at first baptist church in big stone gap about 30 miles southwest 
of here 
youre fighting for your jobs for worker safety youre 
in pain but do not panic jackson said we dont know how long 
the strike will last but we will not surrender 
we do not want any violence but we do want job security and 
justice he said 
the union has accused pittston officials of acting unfairly 
during contract talks and trying to break the umw by refusing to 
negotiate in good faith 
pittston officials have denied those accusations and have said 
the contract proposed by the umw which the other major eastern 
coal producers have signed would threaten the companys stability 
the major sticking points in the talks are pension and health 
benefits according to umw officials 
trumka said the umw would continue following its civil 
disobedience strategy next week he said it would continue beyond 
the virginia coal fields but refused to be more specific 
jackson and trumka said they would soon visit japan to ask steel 
industry officials there to stop buying pittston coal until the 
strike is settled pittston is the largest us supplier of 
metallurgic coal to japan trumka said 
trumka also said that the umw had formed a coalition with the 
australian confederation of mine workers and that australian coal 
company officials had agreed not to fill japanese orders not filled 
by pittston

a drenching thunderstorm 
reduced a 13000acre forest fire near the georgia border to only a 
few smoldering hot spots sunday afternoon fire officials said 
we were lucky the storm moved right over us and rained hard 
for about 20 minutes said florida division of forestry spokesman 
bill scaramellino but theres still a chance things can flare 
back up 
about 200 firefighters and 41 bulldozers remained on the scene 
to watch the hot spots that remained from the fire which doubled 
in size saturday after shifting winds drove an 80foot high wall 
flames northward toward state road 2 
the firefighters including 40 members of a specially trained 
squad from the ozark national forest in arkansas succeeded in 
stopping flames from spreading northward saturday night ending the 
threat to virgin pine land and the okefenokee swamp across the 
border in georgia 
the firefighters used bulldozers and two tanklike vehicles with 
wider treads to penetrate the watery parts of the swamp 
helicopters and planes were also being used to control the blaze 
said us forest service spokesman don bolinger 
state forestry division spokesman kurt stoughton said the fire 
had spread earlier in the week because of dry hot weather and 
windy conditions 
the land was in open wooded areas past pinhook swamp a 
newlyacquired section of the national forest about 23 miles 
northeast of lake city the land is almost unpopulated no serious 
injuries have been reported 
the fire reported wednesday apparently started when the 
transmission in a logmoving vehicle used in commercial timber 
operations broke down and ignited woods just outside the national 
forest

a man dressed all in black and armed 
with a shotgun went on a 15minute shooting spree sunday in a 
northeastern coastal town killing one man and injuring 14 people 
before being arrested officials said 
police were questioning the man to determine the motive for his 
rampage in monkseaton about a mile from the whitley bay seaside 
resort and 250 miles northeast of london 
the gunman who was not identified roamed the streets shooting 
at anyone he saw including one person in a car another on a 
bicycle one in a garden and one outside a church said a spokesman 
for a local ambulance service 
there must have been about 12 different locations given where 
this man had gone round said ken heads superintendent of the 
northumbria ambulance service he was having a go at any person 
he met 
witnesses said the gunman was dressed all in black with dark 
sunglasses and his hair in a pony tail they said he wore an 
ammunition belt around his waist and prowled the streets for 15 
minutes pausing only to shoot 
tenyearold ryan boyd told the british broadcasting corp tv 
news 
across there on the corner there was this man all dressed 
in black from head to foot he started walking around here with the 
gun he was all sturdy rigid he wasnt frightened or anything he 
was just running around with his gun from side to side shooting 
people 
police later said the man they arrested was a 22yearold from 
whitley bay they did not give his name 
after the shooting spree he drove to a pub where authorities 
seized him without any gunfire police said detective 
superintendent bob benton said the suspects vehicle contained a 
loaded shotgun cartridges and a hunting knife 
speaking at a news conference benton said the arrested man was 
not believed to have known personally any of the people he shot 
the first emergency call came at 1201 pm heads said two 
shots were fired at the ambulance as it arrived and the crew had 
to dive for cover he said 
a second ambulance was dispatched and within three or four 
minutes the service was inundated with calls reporting a gunman on 
the loose and people lying injured in the streets he said 
within seven minutes five ambulances from whitley bay and 
nearby newcastle upon tyne and north tyneside were on the scene 
the first crew to arrive found a man lying dead in a street heads 
said 
north tyneside hospital spokesman michael scargill said 14 men 
and women were treated for gunshot wounds he said six were 
hospitalized and eight were sent home 
police identified the dead man as kenneth mackintosh 41 a 
telephone company employee who was married and had two children 
the rev tom grant said parishioners leaving his midday service 
at st andrews united reformed church heard a shot and saw a woman 
fall to the ground opposite their church 
parishioner angela bartle 45 said the injured woman was 
conscious and saying help me but i had to leave her lying 
there because the gunman 150 yards away had reloaded his gun 
and was aiming it at her 
mrs bartle said the gunman looked very calm he wasnt 
shouting anything 
eric holloway 47 said he and his wife and son were in their 
car when they saw the gunman load his shotgun and point it toward 
them i shouted to my wife who was driving to duck down 
holloway said 
then a ford granada came up behind and the man driving that 
car took the shot intended for us when he got out of his car he 
was screaming with pain 
he just kept on reloading and i could see he was experienced 
at handling the gun because of the speed with which he did this 
there was no time to get to him while he was reloading because he 
did it so quickly he said 
grant said the gunman fired about four shots then took off in a 
vehicle as police officers approached 
we were all so surprised it was all over in about 15 minutes 
so there was no panic or anything but for a time we didnt believe 
it 
britains worst shooting incident occurred in august 1987 when 
michael ryan went on a rampage in the town of hungerford west of 
london killing 16 people including his mother before turning his 
gun on himself 
britains already strict gun control laws were then tightened to 
outlaw among other things semiautomatic rifles like the one ryan 
used 
the blood bath shocked britain where most police are unarmed 
and the people believe their society to be relatively free of 
violence

paramedics were called to the century plaza hotel about 115 
pm said fire department spokesman greg acevedo

nausea and vomiting after the halibut luncheon but it was 
unclear if the cause was food poisoning said katie meyer a 
spokeswoman for the plush hotel 
a doctor who was here with the group said it appeared to be a 
chemical reaction she said 
however all items offered at lunch were removed from the hotel 
menu as a precaution she said 
five women were taken to beverly hills medical center where 
they were being examined and were listed in stable condition sunday 
afternoon authorities said

former cbs newsman walter cronkite will 
kick of a campaign aimed at keeping the nations tv sets from being 
turned into vending machines for the pay tv industry a 
broadcasters group said sunday 
the public and broadcasters have taken free tv for granted 
as cable tv and vcrs increasingly eat into the audiences for 
sports news and entertainment programs said milton maltz 
chairman of the free tv task force of the national association of 
broadcasters 
the result he said will be that viewers will have to pay for 
what they once got for free through the american system of 
broadcast television maltz told an appreciative audience at the 
nab convention here 
the pay tv industry is a financial creature born by deal 
makers and bred on junk bonds maltz said local stations are 
under attack by cable operators who can decide to drop a station or 
change a stations channel location at will 
the ravaging of free tv however has yet to begin in 
earnest maltz said 
he said the chairman of a major cable tv operator told him that 
at some point broadcasters will be paying to have their signals 
carried on cable systems 
maltz said sports on free tv were an endangered species and an 
owner of a national football league team had told him the nfls 
plan was to make every tv receiver an extension of the stadium 
box office 
i wouldnt be surprised that in his mind he could visualize 
every set as the equivalent of a program vending machine maltz 
said 
indeed he could probably even hear the machine crying out 
every half hour feed me feed me as the viewer obliges by 
stuffing more dollars in the slot maltz said 
he urged the broadcasters to act to make the public aware of 
the danger facing our institution of free tv 
cronkites message will appear within the next two months 
simultaneously on prime time in every tv station in the country 
maltz said to launch the free tv campaign which also will include 
additional onair promotions by local stations 
the issue is simple maltz said is the future pay tv or 
is it free tv there is room there is need for both

opposition leaders warned of voting 
irregularities sunday as paraguayans prepared to vote in the freest 
elections in decades 
polls predict that gen andres rodriguez who led a coup feb 3 
to oust the dictatorship of gen alfredo stroessner will win up to 
70 percent of the vote in mondays elections 
however rodriguezs closest challenger longtime opposition 
leader domingo laino of the authentic radical liberal party has 
told voters that they could be risking a stroessner system 
without stroessner 
we are conscious that we are participating in elections that 
are marked by flaws but were doing it becuase we want a peaceful 
transition not a violent one laino said sunday 
fernando vera the top candidate of the revolutionary febrerista 
party openly predicted rodriguez and the colorado party would win 
the presidency and control of congress and worried that his party 
could not even be sure its ballots would be available at every one 
of the more than 10000 voting tables nationwide 
weve distributed our ballots to the main places but im not 
sure weve gotten through to smaller more remote villages across 
this californiasized south american republic of 4 million he said 
the parties are responsible for printing and distributing their 
own ballots 
rodriguez insists that mondays voting will be fair voters will 
cast ballots in private and their right index finger will be 
dipped in indelible purple ink afterward to prevent double voting 
the general told an international election observer on sunday 
do you like soccer well in a soccer game the team that loses 
usually blames the referee the lineman and the conditions of the 
field 
rodriguez was one of stroessners closest aides before bringing 
down the 34yearlong regime and taking over as provisional 
president rodriguez also belongs to the colorado party which has 
controlled the government for 42 years 
voters also will pick 36 senators and 72 deputies to fill all 
the seats of the two legislative chambers 
the winning party is awarded twothirds control of congress the 
other parties will split the remaining seats 
eight parties including many banned under stroessner have 
fielded slates of candidates 
the main issue of the campaign has been who can best promote 
democracy in this country that has never known it many paraguayans 
have concluded that rodriguez who controls the army and enjoys 
great personal prestige is as good a choice as any 
rodriguez has pledged to build democratic government restore 
human rights and allow freedom of the press 
however laino has urged paraguayans to choose a complete 
political housecleaning rather than to continue the stroessner 
system with a few new names 
laino has said his party will pull out of any government that 
does not reform the constitution electoral law and penal code 
even many laino supporters doubt he can win 
only the colorados are likely to have ballots at virtually all 
the 10000 voting tables nationwide 
the colorados have dominated the airwaves with commercials 
they are also most likely to benefit from a bloated outdated 
voter registration list of 22 million even election officials 
acknowledge it may carry 600000 names too many 
voting is obligatory for paraguayans ages 18 to 60 polls open 
at 7 am 7 am edt and close at 4 pm 4 pm edt unofficial 
results are expected late monday night

centrist ulysses guimaraes defeated a 
progressive opponent sunday to win the presidential nomination of 
the governing party at the end of a turbulent convention 
the selection is considered the formal opening of the campaign 
for the countrys first direct presidential election in 29 years 
the vote is scheduled for nov 15 
the members of the brazilian democratic movement party picked 
guimaraes a 72yearold federal congressman and former party 
president over waldir pires governor of the northeastern state of 
bahia pires was the choice of the partys progressive wing 
some influential party members put up strong resistance to 
guimaraes arguing instead for a younger more vigorous figure to 
contest the challenge posed by increasingly popular leftwing 
candidates 
the democratic movement party is the countrys largest thus 
making guimaraes a serious contender in the election 
however political analysts give the party a slim chance of 
sweeping the election as it has done in past polling they say it 
is associated with the failures of president and party member jose 
sarney who has been unable to stop 1000 percent annual inflation 
and reverse public disenchantement with traditional politics 
guimaraes opponents in the race include centrist reformer 
fernando collor de mello governor of the poor northeastern state 
of alagoas he is forming a new party 
other contenders are leftwing populist leonel brizola former 
governor of rio de janeiro state and a member of the democratic 
labor party and federal congressman luis inacio lula da silva of 
the workers party a socialist group 
brazil returned to civilian rule under sarney in 1985 after 21 
years of military rule however sarney took office after an 
electoral college vote controlled by the military regime 
under the constitution he cannot run for reelection

white house to pull the money off the table complained john 
devillars state environmental secretary
