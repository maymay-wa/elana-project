neighbors of the pilgrim nuclear power 
plant said wednesday that a study showing higher than normal 
leukemia rates in their area justified emergency efforts to lower 
the plants radiation emissions 
about 80 residents attended a meeting called by the state to 
discuss the department of public health report released the 
previous day 
the study showed that adults who lived within 10 miles of the 
pilgrim nuclear power plant in the 1970s and early 1980s were four 
times more likely to develop leukemia than were those who live 
farther away 
the study does not prove that the plant which opened in 1972 
caused the cancers many health experts believe the emissions from 
nuclear plants are safe 
also public health commissioner david mulligan said emission 
levels have declined since the 1970s the report found no increased 
risk associated with the plant after 1984 
but mary elizabeth lambert of the duxbury nuclear affairs 
committee was not satisfied 
clearly radiation has been here it will be in your 
thanksgiving dinner in your cranberry sauce she said 
pat granahan of hingham said you should be declaring a public 
health emergency theres too much at stake 
lambert urged mulligan to implement radiation monitoring within 
the plants emission stack rather than just monitoring in the area 
outside the plant 
mulligan said the state was moving toward stricter standards 
cutting the acceptable level of emission from 25 to 10 millirems 
per year he said the new limit which was a recommendation in the 
report would be in place with within six months 
a rem is a measurement of radiation absorbed in living tissue a 
millirem is a thousandth of a rem a diagnostic chest xray 
involves 20 millirems to 30 millirems of radiation 
some of the people attending the meeting asked the state to 
study other longterm cancers in addition to leukemia in the 
region 
mary ott cochairman of the citizens urging responsible energy 
based in duxbury said the plant should be closed we feel we 
have been subjected to enough risk from pilgrim she said 
no pilgrim officials spoke at the meeting 
boston edison which operates the plant in plymouth said 
earlier that the report contradicts other evidence including a 
study released last month by the national cancer institute 
in the cancer institute study researchers surveyed more than 
900000 cancer deaths in 107 counties around 62 nuclear facilities 
across the united states they found that people living near 
nuclear plants had no greater risk of dying from cancer than did 
people who lived far away from them

francia martinez stood 
in line for rice beans and flour she wanted sugar too but knew 
there would be none of that sweet staple 
sugar the foundation of this caribbean nations economy for 400 
years is gone from store shelves it is being shipped to foreign 
buyers who pay more than dominicans can afford 
nobody understands whats going on in this country said 
freddy sanchez waiting in a nearby gas station line that was four 
blocks long prices go up but were still short 
mrs martinez taking shelter from the midday sun under a black 
umbrella said she was lacking everything at home for her 
husband and three children 
rising consumer prices and shortages of gasoline food 
electricity even water are causing hardships and widespread 
protest among the dominican republics 7 million people 
two nationwide protest strikes since august have led to violence 
between security forces and demonstrators in which at least 14 
people have been killed and 90 wounded police report 2300 
arrests but strike leaders say the number is higher 
a few days before a strike in september three santo domingo 
university students were killed by the explosion of a bomb they 
were making on campus police found an arsenal of explosives in 
santiago the secondlargest city 
protest began when president joaquin balaguer imposed economic 
austerity shortly before beginning his second consecutive fouryear 
term in august 
he ended subsidies for such basic goods as flour cooking oil 
and gasoline causing prices to triple in some cases gasoline has 
risen since august from 55 cents a gallon to 142 with added help 
from the iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 
balaguers government could not afford the normal level of oil 
imports after the persian gulf crisis drove world prices up so it 
began importing about onethird less and rationed gasoline 
theres no flour sugar gas medicine because the country has 
no dollars no foreign currency no reserves said andres 
dauhakre a leading economist certainly the crisis in the middle 
east doesnt help 
economic problems have mounted since world sugar prices 
collapsed and us import quotas were cut in the 1980s last years 
crop was smaller than usual 
the dominican republic which shares the island of hispaniola 
with haiti has a foreign debt of 41 billion by conservative 
estimates 28 percent of its workers are jobless and annual 
inflation is 70 percent 
a 500 million building spree largely tied to the 500th 
anniversary in 1992 of columbus discovery of america has created 
schools roads housing irrigation dams and monuments but the 
government has financed it by the inflationary means of printing 
money 
power plants have deteriorated from neglect causing blackouts 
of up to 18 hours a day many homes and factories have their 
generators but fuel shortages make them unreliable breakdowns of 
electric pumps cause water shortages 
the international monetary fund demanded the austerity measures 
balaguer 84 and blind from glaucoma says they are necessary and 
has urged dominicans to conserve 
we have to use less gas go out less go to the beach less 
he said recently we must appeal to dominican patriotism so that 
we can overcome this crisis 
there is no current agreement with the imf because the country 
could not pay interest on most of its debt in the past year it is 
ineligible for loans and has no credit 
talks with the imf are under way but dominicans are wary the 
last imf program in 1984 led to higher prices and riots that took 
100 lives 
tourism the really bright prospect is expected to net 1 
billion this year but visitors may start choosing islands with 
fewer problems 
officials blame the unrest on supporters of leftist former 
president juan bosch 81 whom balaguer defeated by 1 percent of 
the vote in may 
jose luis arteaga balaguers economic adviser said the 
opposition thinks the balaguer government is illegitimate because 
of the elections they want to make life impossible for us 
bosch accused balaguer his longtime political foe of 
widespread vote fraud but an independent electoral board said a 
lengthy review of voting tallies produced no evidence 
balaguers narrow victory deprived his conservative social 
christian reformist party of a congressional majority and critics 
accuse him of ruling by decree 
to soften the the austerity measures the government gave public 
employees a 30 percent pay raise and froze some prices the freezes 
have led to speculative buying creating further shortages 
unions demand a 150 percent general raise the minimum wage now 
is equivalent to 72 a month

the framers of mississippis 1890 
constitution envisioned a payasyougo government with the 
governor and treasurer counting by hand twice a year the money 
locked away in a huge black vault hidden in the capitol 
the voters are being asked to lift that 100yearold burden in 
the nov 6 election 
historians say the provision hasnt been followed since at least 
the turn of the century the requirement dates to when state 
governments paid all their bills in cash treasurer marshall 
bennett said 
i dont think the framers had computer printouts in mind 
bennett said as a procedural matter it is impossible to comply 
we dont keep money in the vault anymore its distributed to 
financial institutions 
the best the governor can do is to see a computer printout or 
an electronic blip in a computer chip it will relieve the burden 
of noncompliance for a procedure left behind by technology 
amending state constitutions is almost a fall ritual in the 
south 
mississippi has amended its cumbersome 24000word constitution 
102 times over the last century it has four more constitutional 
housekeeping amendments on the ballot this fall 
earlier this month louisiana tacked 14 amendments on its 1973 
constitution for a total of 41 in less than two decades 
in arkansas voters will decide nov 6 whether to remove a 
constitutional provision that ordered government officials to 
resist integration under threat of arrest and prosecution 
the provision was put in the states constitution in 1956 as 
federal courts were beginning to strike down segregation laws but 
it was never enforced 
texas voters are being asked to clear up confusion over when the 
state senate must approve gubernatorial appointments 
earlier this year the state attorney general ruled such 
appointments must be confirmed in the senates first session 
whether special or regular after the appointment an amendment 
before the voters would require the senate to consider the matter 
in the legislatures first regular session after the nomination 
allowing an unconfirmed appointee to hold office in the interim 
in mississippi the voters also will be considering amendments 
that would 
end the states pension obligation to civil war veterans and 
their widows the last person eligible for one kate jobe nelms of 
corinth died march 28 1987 according to state records her 
pension for that year was 2500 
remove a provision setting the boundaries of the state 
backers say the boundaries are now set in law and are not needed in 
the constitution 
delete a provision giving the legislature authority to elect 
us senators and appoint presidential electors federal and state 
law now provide for direct election of senators while presidential 
electors are put on the ballot by political parties 
remove a requirement that county supervisors must own land in 
the district from which they are elected before they can take 
office backers says court decisions have rendered the provision 
unconstitutional

when the daily mail asked eight people if 
they thought the united states should invade iraq and kuwait to 
resolve the persian gulf crisis only two said yes debbie harnish 
29 of hagerstown said us troops should just get back over 
here 
when the organization americans talk security asked how long 
us forces should remain in saudi arabia if theres a stalemate 
only 12 percent said indefinitely but 32 percent predicted thats 
how long troops will be there 
it was the ghost of vietnam question said alan kay founder 
of the bipartisan group of pollsters 
sen bob kerrey may have spoken for more americans than he 
thought when he said he is profoundly uneasy about the 
deployment of us troops in the middle east 
the uneasiness is quiet people who are uneasy dont usually 
march in parades and carry banners about it theyre just uneasy 
public opinion polls show broad support for president bushs 
actions so far in the gulf crisis but also show that a large 
majority of americans oppose quick military action against iraq 
in pasadena calif the rev george regas rector of all saints 
episcopal church said i think there is a lot of despair i think 
bush is going to be surprised when he thinks that the support he 
has can be translated into real support for the tragedy of war i 
just dont think its going to be there 
in philadelphia harold jordan coordinator of the national 
youth and militarism program of the american friends service 
committee reported receiving 550 to 600 calls and letters since 
early august from people who never had any contact with organized 
peace or antiwar movements in the past some jordan said say 
they would fight if they felt this country was truly threatened 
but they dont see this as being a threat 
kerrey a nebraska democrat said in a sept 19 speech on the 
senate floor i am profoundly uneasy about the instant deployment 
of over 100000 american troops sold to the american people on 
false assertions that saddam hussein is adolf hitler that our way 
of life is at clear and present danger that we have as much at 
stake as we did in world war ii 
kerrey also said that many probably a majority of 
nebraskans had accepted president bushs rationale for the 
deployment 
more than two weeks later kerreys press secretary steve 
jarding said that hasnt changed its still pretty strong that 
he ought to be supporting the president 
rep jim mcdermott dwash on the other hand said telephone 
calls and letters from his district have reflected a lot of 
support for the position of getting out of the arabian desert 
mcdermott voted against a resolution supporting the presidents 
actions in the crisis but emphasizing the need for diplomacy to 
resolve it the resolution passed the house 38029 on oct 1 and 
the senate passed a similar measure the following day 
mcdermott said that when he was attending meetings in his home 
district during the august recess the question was raised what 
are we doing in the gulf it was more a questioning than a 
statement of support or attack more recently he said people 
began to raise the question of why dont we get out of there 
some of the dissent of course comes from longtime critics of 
us military involvement abroad demonstrators have begun to 
appear in lafayette square across pennsylvania avenue from the 
white house on one recent afternoon reprising a refrain from the 
vietnam era they shouted hell no we wont go 
and the president has his allout backers as well i support 
his action and know he has far more advisers with a lot more 
knowledge of whats going on than i could ever imagine said 
darlene brown of rockville md president of the young republicans 
of montgomery county 
yet jordan of the quakerbased friends service committee said he 
is getting calls from people hardly any of them quakers from a 
wide variety of fairly ordinary backgrounds 
we see people from hillbilly country in west virginia folks 
in idaho all kinds he said we are getting calls from pay 
booths on military installations some people have made it clear 
that if they are ordered they are not going these are people who 
have been pushed over the edge by the persian gulf situation

voters in 11 states may vent their frustration over government 
waste and sluggish school reform by passing some of the toughest 
taxing and spending limits ever considered 
the number of antitax antispending measures on nov 6 ballots 
doesnt match the peak tax revolt years in the early 1980s 18 
states had them in 1980 just two years after californias 
proposition 13 started it all 
but several of this years crop rank with the most stringent 
ever considered a gauge of how fed up many voters may be over 
what they see as government waste excessive or unfair taxes and a 
muchtouted school reform movement that has yet to live up to its 
promise 
these people are saying to government youve failed us 
people are really really up in arms said john keast an analyst 
specializing in ballot measures for the conservative free congress 
foundation in washington dc 
and to the dismay of many politicians and educators who stand to 
lose the most if the measures are passed opinion polls show 
several with an excellent chance of approval 
theyre all bad and were working hard to defeat them said 
keith geiger president of the national education association the 
2million member teachers union it would be a tremendous blow to 
public education in any state that passed them 
among the toughest 
massachusetts question 3 a 2 billion tax rollback 15 
percent of the state budget it would be the largest state tax cut 
in history opponents argue it would gut public education and lead 
to tens of thousands of state layoffs but polls show broad 
support 
oregons measure 5 a permanent cap of 15 percent on property 
tax increases phased in by 1995 oregon voters defeated five 
previous attempts to limit taxes this time an early poll shows 69 
percent favoring 
colorados amendment 1 requiring voter approval for any state 
or local tax increases effective dec 31 a similar proposal lost 
by a wide margin in 1988 
nebraskas measure 405 which backers call the 2 percent 
solution would put a 2 percent limit on annual state and local 
budget increases local spending restrictions could be overriden by 
referendum at the state level it would take a vote of 40 of the 
49 legislators 
californias 28 statewide ballot measures include three 
proposed tax increases among them a sharp hike in alcohol taxes 
but another issue that would require a twothirds majority on any 
ballot issue raising taxes could instantly cancel out any such tax 
increases 
in montana a proposed constitutional amendment would abolish 
all state income property and sales taxes and licensing fees 
replacing them with a scantly defined transaction charge of 1 
percent on all financial dealings the plan is so radical that 
neither backers nor opponents seem sure if it would increase or cut 
taxes 
a second montana initiative would hike the state cigarette tax 
140 percent to 43 cents a pack which would be the highest in the 
nation 
elsewhere utah voters will decide whether to exempt most food 
from the state sales tax a florida proposal would permit local 
governments to avoid complying with state laws requiring local 
funding unless the law fulfills an important state purpose an 
advisory referendum in wisconsin asks whether the state should be 
required to pay for any program it mandates on local governments 
in nevada gov bob miller and state business groups have begun 
a 200000 media campaign o defeat a proposed corporate tax 
increase to aid education the state teachers union the original 
backer withdrew its support when it was assured that another tax 
package would be supported in the 1991 legislative session but 
polls still suggest the outcome could go either way 
nevadans also will vote on a constitutional amendment 
prohibiting personal income taxes a similar initiative passed in 
1988 but must be approved a second time to become part of the state 
constitution 
three maryland counties anne arundel baltimore and montgomery 
will vote on proposed property tax limits a fourth wealthy talbot 
county will decide whether to relax an existing property tax 
freeze 
the massachusetts and oregon issues are among the most worrisome 
to the neas geiger in oregon the tax issue is one of eight 
volatile ballot initiatives and the potential for confusion is 
high he said 
massachusetts officials fear the poorest school districts 
including fall river new bedford holyoke and lawrence might go 
bankrupt because they rely almost solely on state education aid 
we would be on the brink of an educational meltdown said 
state education commissioner harold raynolds jr 
the tax battle has also turned bitter in nebraska where college 
leaders local educators and municipal officials are claiming 
disaster and massive layoffs if the 2percent cap is passed 
but omaha tax activist ed jaksha who led the successful 
petition drive challenged those dire predictions 
can any of you deny the right of the people to enter into the 
budget making process he demanded at a summit of mayors last 
month

watergate was a word you learned in grade 
school your teenage years coincided with the me decade and 
come jobhunting time the greedisgood mantra from wall 
street echoed everywhere 
you belong to a generation that is less anchored in bedrock 
ethical values than any other according to a study by the 
josephson institute for the advancement of ethics 
an unprecedented proportion of todays youth lack commitment 
to core moral values like honesty personal responsibility respect 
for others and civic duty concludes the report scheduled for 
release friday 
but critics including educators ethicists and some of the 
18to30yearolds in question say the los angelesbased 
nonprofit institutes study is overstated 
i dont see rampant amorality said stephen f davis a 
psychology professor at emporia state university of kansas his 
survey on cheating among 6000 college students nationwide was one 
of about a dozen studies on which michael josephson based his 
report 
there are some messages in our data but certainly i wouldnt 
go so far as to indict an entire generation based on it davis 
said this week 
but josephson said his conclusions which were drawn from 
published and unpublished polls articles and about 40 original 
interviews indicated a meaningful demonstrable discernible 
disintegration in moral standards 
its a total picture that really tells the story said 
josephson whose nonpartisan institute conducts ethics programs 
for the internal revenue service the pentagon several major media 
organizations and educators 
the studys source material included surveys conducted at the 
california department of education rutgers university the 
university of delaware and the higher education research institute 
at the university of california los angeles 
among the indicators josephson cites 
during the 1980s the majority of college freshman surveyed 
admitted to cheating in high school 
young americans are 40 percent less likely to identify 
frequent newsmakers than those over age 30 those 24 or under vote 
less than any previous generation 
professional resume and referencechecking services estimate 
that from 10 percent to 25 percent of jobseekers a large 
percentage of whom are under 30 falsify their credentials 
a recent published survey found 70 percent of females under 18 
were sexually active in 1989 compared with 54 percent a decade 
earlier for males the increase was from 66 percent in 1979 to 72 
percent last year 
its an interpretation of many isolated pieces of information 
theyre entitled to their interpretation and maybe theyre right 
but im not in agreement said elaine elkhawas vice president 
for research at the american council on education in washington 
dc i find much that is heartening 
john gabarro a professor at the harvard business school 
agreed 
ive been teaching now for about 18 years and i have not 
experienced a decline in either the ethical values that students 
espouse or their concern with those issues gabarro said in 
fact if anything ive seen a keener awareness and interest 
this is the generation that has watched the stock market 
plummet the real estate market bust and the environment grow 
worse they rattle off names like gary hart michael milken ivan 
boesky and donald trump 
weve seen that happiness isnt just getting ahead at any 
cost said laura rich 25 a medical student at the university of 
north carolina at chapel hill were trying to make ourselves 
happy but dont see a reason to abandon our morals 
arthur levine director of harvard universitys educational 
management institute said young adults are a product of the me 
era and do in many ways feel a false sense of entitlement 
but after more than a decade of surveying his students values 
levine said he has noticed a welcome swing in recent years toward 
community commitment and social awareness 
im very optimistic about this generation he said 
there will always be people willing to do anything to get 
something said beth springer a brand assistant at the clorox 
co in oakland calif but there are also lots of people looking 
to give back to their community 
but josephsons study concludes otherwise 
there are undeniable signs that the moral fiber of our country 
is weakening the study warns the new generation acts as if 
the world owes them as if they have a right to win as if they 
need whatever they want and deserve whatever they need

they are in their third month of holding out 
against all odds 10 us diplomats refusing to bow to iraqs 
annexation of kuwait or to leave other americans in the terrorized 
persian gulf country without an official us presence 
not that ambassador w nathaniel howell and his beleaguered 
staff can do much for their 500 or so countrymen many of whom are 
in hiding and several of whom are desperately ill 
telephone conversations are intentionally brief on the 
supposition that iraqi eavesdroppers are listening for useful 
information about the whereabouts of the elusive americans their 
risktaking kuwaiti protectors or washingtons intentions 
through satellite communication the embassy also is in touch 
with the state department 
periodically iraqi troops seize americans and dispatch them to 
oil fields and other installations to serve as human shields 
against a us assault they are beyond the reach of howell and the 
other diplomats who themselves are prohibited from leaving the 
embassy 
nor can anyone or any vehicle enter the embassy with supplies or 
for whatever reason 
more than 100 americans are forcibly scattered through kuwait 
which iraqi president saddam hussein now regards as a province of 
his country there is no indication that the bush administration is 
hatching a plot to rescue them 
one by one other governments have yielded to circumstances and 
closed their embassies among western nations only britain 
canada france and germany are holding out along with the united 
states 
conditions inside the compound are rough an undisclosed number 
of americans who managed to take refuge there are sharing limited 
resources with the diplomats 
water and electricity were cut off a month ago as iraq tried to 
enforce its order for foreign embassies to close now that kuwait no 
longer was an independent country 
the americans were reduced to boiling the water in the embassy 
swimming pool there is some water left but it is not being 
replenished 
bathing is out of course generators provide intermittent 
electricity howell deputy ambassador barbara bodine and the other 
americans are using outside latrines 
they sometimes sleep outdoors at night to keep cool despite 
swarms of mosquitoes according to jesse jackson and others who 
returned from kuwait last month 
their food situation is adequate a us official told the 
associated press on wednesday 
the americans are subsisting on canned food and perishable items 
that were stocked in the embassy before iraqs aug 2 blitzkrieg 
invasion nothing has come in since 
i dont want to speculate how long they are going to hold 
out said the official who requested anonymity 
the 10 american diplomats are the remnants of a oncesizable 
embassy before the invasion the heat and dearth of fastbreaking 
events made assignment to kuwait less than exciting 
on the other hand the wealth and stability of the oilrich 
emirate made kuwait one of the least difficult posts in the arab 
world 
about 50 american diplomats and their families left for baghdad 
in a motorcade in august only to find when they got there that only 
the dependents were permitted to fly home so those diplomats also 
are stuck but under less onerous conditions 
life in the kuwait embassy is kind of hot stuffy and 
boring the us official said they are still there because we 
dont recognize the annexation we will not recognize an order 
based on annexation and we want to help american citizens 
the countries that gave up havent accepted annexation either 
they left because they were no longer able to maintain their 
personnel the official said 
among the americans he said morale is pretty high and yet 
they are bored stiff

presented his recommendations 
energy raise the 9cent gasoline tax by another 9 cents in two 
steps homeheating oil would not be affected 
alcohol double the beer tax to 32 cents a sixpack raise taxes 
on all types of wine table wine for example would go from the 
present 3 cents a 750milliliter bottle to 25 cents the tax on 
100proof liquor now 1250 a gallon would rise to 1370 or 
274 a fifth 
tobacco raise the 16cent tax on cigarettes by 8 cents in two 
steps taxes on chewing tobacco cigars snuff and pipe tobacco 
would go up 25 percent 
luxuries impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of the sales 
price of cars over 30000 jewelry and furs over 5000 and boats 
over 100000 
airline tickets raise the 8 percent tax to 10 percent 
medicare wages apply the 145 percent tax that finances part of 
medicare to a workers first 85000 to 90000 of wages each year 
rather than the first 51300 under present law 
medicare boost to 100 the 75ayear deductible that 
beneficiaries must pay before medicare begins paying hospital 
costs there would be no increase in the monthly premiums for 
medicare part b 
capital gains exclude from taxation 30 percent of gains from 
the sale of property owned three or more years 
incometax rates eliminate a provision in the law that taxes 
part of the earnings of the wealthiest americans at a top rate of 
28 percent while people earning slightly less can face a maximum 
rate of 33 percent this would mean a tax increase for example 
for a single person with taxable income above 97620 and for a 
couple with no children and a taxable income above 162770

two weeks from the end of its twoyear term 
the 101st congress has little to brag about and much to do 
the preoccupation with getting a budget has backed up other 
important legislation on subjects ranging from clean air and 
housing to civil rights and child care 
with antiincumbent sentiment running high across the country 
no member of congress wants to face voters having done little more 
than approve job protection rights for the disabled an inadequate 
savings and loan bailout and a congressional pay raise 
its been a thin session so far theres no question about 
it said thomas mann who studies congress for the brookings 
institution a washington think tank 
before they can go home for an abbreviated campaign season 
lawmakers still must pass the nuts and bolts taxes and spending 
cuts to enact the vague guidelines they have agreed to in the 
budget and the 13 annual spending bills needed to run the 
government through next sept 30 
that wont be easy the bill implementing the budget agreement 
will have to include 135 billion or more in new taxes possibly 
including levies on gasoline alcoholic beverages and cigarettes 
and about 40 billion in medicare savings including higher 
deductibles for beneficiaries 
if the budget deal is genuine that overwhelms everything else 
and becomes the major piece of legislation by which the congress is 
remembered said mann they will have tackled the biggest 
problem that has haunted government for a decade 
on top of those mustd bills leaders in both houses have a 
pareddown list of other items they want badly to complete 
topping the list is a compromise clean air act the first 
rewrite since 1977 of the law setting air quality standards the 
house and senate have passed significantly different versions and 
negotiators have struggled since july to reconcile them with 
little success 
the bill would impose broad new air pollution control 
requirements on factories power plants and automobiles to ease 
acid rain and urban smog and for the first time require broad 
industrial controls on toxic chemical releases 
estimates are that it would cost as much as 25 billion a year 
to comply with the tougher regulations when they go into effect 
toward the end of this decade 
another top priority is legislation providing federal child care 
assistance including money to lowincome families through tax 
credits the house and senate have passed differing versions and 
the bills have been stuck in a conference committee for months but 
congressional leaders are pushing their negotiators to agree so a 
bill can be sent to president bush 
negotiations are continuing as well to compromise on house and 
senate versions of a bill providing support for affordable housing 
for lowincome families 
one littlenoticed measure that falls into the mustpass 
category is new money for the resolution trust corp which has run 
dry as it seeks to take over failed savings and loans an estimated 
90 billion will be needed this year to cover losses and provide 
working capital 
house and senate conferees also are to begin resolving 
differences over an anticrime bill following house action last 
week to broaden use of capital punishment and curtail the appeal 
rights of death row inmates 
negotiations on a new fiveyear farm bill which stalled over 
indecision on the budget were to continue today with discussion of 
conservation provisions still to be worked out is exactly how 
commodity subsidies will be trimmed to make the required 13 
billion in savings over the life of the bill 
also pending and facing a presidential veto threat is a civil 
rights bill aimed at protecting employees from job discrimination 
elements range from a ban on racial harassment in the workplace to 
a provision locking in courtapproved fairhiring agreements 
the core of the bill would ease the way for minorities to win 
discrimination suits against employers the administration and some 
business groups say the senatepassed measure would prompt 
companies to hire by quota as a way of insulating themselves 
against such suits the bill would negate or modify 10 supreme 
court decisions since 1985 
while the leaders would like to avoid it many on capitol hill 
believe congress may have to come back after the elections in 
november for a lameduck session to tackle unfinished business 
other items expected to come up in the final days of the 
congressional session include 
an intelligence authorization bill that has been the focus of a 
battle between the house and senate over whether to continue covert 
us support for rebels in angola afghanistan and cambodia 
a bill authorizing activities of the national endowment for the 
arts and deciding how far the government should go in determining 
whether a work is obscene 
an extension of the nations borrowing authority to 3444 
trillion 
whether to grant mostfavorednation trading status to china

you cant step into a phone booth in the saudi 
arabian desert and dial up westport mass but army spec 4 mike 
orr still managed a chat with his wife jennifer 
the 22yearold father was told that his 2monthold son whom 
he has seen only briefly ate baby cereal for the first time 
monday 
he made some funny faces mrs orr said 
i wish i could have been there he answered 
when the soldiers who are part of operation desert shield yearn 
to hear a voice from home they have to wait in line at jeeps to 
use shortwave radios 
theyre connected with relatives and friends back home thanks to 
the hundreds of people in the united states who are licensed to 
operate on military radio channels and link the transmissions to 
phone lines 
one of them james sylvester operates from the basement of his 
queens apartment as a part of the military affiliated radio system 
sylvester and everyone else who uses the radio system never say 
saudi arabia or the desert they simply refer to it as the 
sandbox 
in the last three weeks sylvester has made more than 350 
connections between gis and the folks at home while continuing to 
work at his regular job as a bus mechanic for the transit 
authority 
on some nights he has skipped sleep entirely rather than leave 
soldiers disappointed in the desert 
sometimes the static makes mincemeat of the dialogue 
for instance army soldier 20yearold rick pascoe of wildwood 
ill asked brigid cromie a family friend to make sure he is sent 
20 cans of tuna fish in water the word in got lost in the 
transmission 
ill ask them to send 20 cans of tuna and a couple of jugs of 
water cromie told him 
no tuna in water not water pascoe corrected 
nearly all of the messages are simple the soldiers ask about 
relatives one asked about a car another warned his brother to use 
condoms relatives on the home end ask about the weather or if mail 
is being received 
the mail is stockpiling its being handed out very slowly 
said orr 
is it real hot his wife asked 
its 3 oclock in the morning and its probably 75 degrees 
he replied 
each person being called in the united states must be told to 
say over at the end of each statement so sylvester knows when 
to flick the switch back so the soldier can do the talking 
the soldiers are warned not to tell about their mission or 
location they are limited to five minutes each 
one of the soldiers operating a radio from a jeep in the desert 
monday was sgt rich larue of scranton pa 
it makes my job really worthwhile he said the guys are 
really happy once theyre connected to be able to talk to their 
family or spouse 
sylvester agreed 
some really turn loose he said referring to calls that 
bring more tears than words i think after this i might change 
occupations and become a psychologist 
i love you was the most common message among about 15 calls 
placed monday evening one woman cried while she spoke it appeared 
to matter little what was said 
some people dont care about static sylvester said as 
long as they hear a little of the persons voice thats all that 
matters

government job recruiting will suffer 
following the latest budget dispute say federal workers who call 
the weekend shutdown a direct threat to their job security 
if you were in the top 5 percent of your class and were 
excited about doing some significant research for a cure for aids 
would you want to come to work for the federal government i think 
not said john sturdivant president of the american federation 
of government employees 
federal workers have always known theyre not going to get rich 
added robert tobias president of the national treasury employees 
union but there was an implicit agreement that they had job 
security that agreement has been ripped apart the past few 
weeks 
but government hiring officials dismissed the likelihood of any 
longterm damage from the weekend government shutdown 
other than a political brouhaha in washington im not sure 
abot any lingering effects on recruitment this could all be 
forgotten in three weeks said richard mcgowan a spokesman for 
the office of personnel management 
how much is a kid on a university campus in cleveland paying 
attention to this it looms very large for us in washington my own 
estimate is it probably wont have a big impact on the campuses in 
the hinterlands added len klein opms director of hiring 
the governments belowaverage pay scale not job security 
concerns is whats hurting recruitment klein said 
hundreds of thousands of federal workers were spared tuesday at 
least temporarily from being furloughed after congress and the 
white house struck a budget deal and ended a government shutdown 
that hit over the threeday columbus day holiday weekend 
the shutdown affected mostly national monuments parks and 
museums which were closed for lack of workers as thousands of 
disappointed tourists were turned away 
the threat of a government shutdown had hung over federal 
employees for weeks they still could face furloughs if lawmakers 
cant reach a budget agreement by oct 19 
the wellpublicized budget dispute and the way federal workers 
were caught up in it will make government work less appealing 
especially while the government is trying to spruce up its image 
said sturdivant president of the 700000member afge 
the federal government already has a bad knock for its pay 
scale federal workers on average earn about 22 percent less than 
their counterparts in the private sector sturdivant said in 
addition the government pays about 1100 a year less in health 
care premiums for each worker than is paid by the average 
mediumsized or large corporation 
however opms mcgowan dismissed the likelihood of any longterm 
impact saying there are dozens of rewarding and challenging 
career paths available in the civil service 
in march opm waged a sixcity job fair blitz in a bid to lure 
new hires bringing along astronauts and undercover agents to show 
off government careers mcgowan noted 
we had 30000 people wrapped around the labor department in 
washington trying to get into government service he said 
federal workers said the latest threat of a shutdown is hurting 
the united states in other ways 
other countries of the world have got to be laughing their 
heads off we try to run the world but we cant manage our own 
affairs complained tom doherty an occupational safety and 
health administration inspector from allentown pa 
you have no idea the turmoil this has caused for some people 
the ones trying to support a family on one paycheck doherty 
said i keep telling them your voice is at the ballot box come 
election time good bad or indifferent we just go in and vote for 
the guys opponent

john sununu may have the reputation on capitol 
hill of a bull in a china shop but his boss says theres bound 
to be a little broken china when passions get high 
president bush rallied to the defense of his abrasive chief of 
staff and his almost equally abrasive budget director richard g 
darman i have full confidence in them bush said at a news 
conference tuesday they did an outstanding job 
even so following the collapse of a budget agreement negotiated 
by the white house and congressional leaders the two top white 
house aides have been the target of heavy criticism from 
congressional budget negotiators of both parties 
sununu and darman got the vote of confidence from the man who 
counts 
but the residual hard feelings could make it harder for bush to 
patch up differences with congressional leaders and heal the 
gaping rift among house republicans in the coming days 
at one point last weekend democratic budget negotiators refused 
to meet with their republican counterparts if sununu and darman 
were at the table 
rep jim lightfoot riowa wrote a letter to bush urging him to 
come to capitol hill on a peacekeeping mission but to leave the 
pit bulldogs at the white house 
lawmakers have bristled at what they say is sununus arrogance 
and heavyhandedness in dealing with members of congress 
sununu asked by reporters tuesday if he thought he had gone too 
far retorted i dont think so we got a budget passed didnt 
we 
bush asked if he had taken any members of his staff to the 
woodshed as a result of the congressional criticism said 
absolutely not 
when the passions get high i understand that theres bound to 
be a little broken china up there the president said 
its not the first time that sununu has been in trouble with 
congress on budget issues or that bush had to rally to his 
defense 
early in the budget negotiations last summer sununu suggested 
that the president really didnt mean it when he suggested for the 
first time that he would consider tax increases to reduce the 
deficit 
democrats were outraged white house press secretary marln 
fitzwater had to disavow the remarks but in the end bush stood 
fast by his embattled aide 
nor is sununu the first presidential chief of staff to generate 
harsh feelings 
donald t regan who was president reagans chief of staff for 
most of his second term was almost universally disliked by 
democrats in congress many other white house staffers and 
perhaps more significantly by first lady nancy reagan 
like sununu regan was accused of being caustic and arrogant 
some of the same criticism was leveled at hr haldeman 
president nixons heavyhanded chief of staff and a central figure 
in the watergate scandal 
and president carters chief of staff hamilton jordan so 
angered thenhouse speaker thomas p oneill dmass that oneill 
deliberately and consistently mispronounced his name calling him 
hannibal jerkin 
lawmakers claimed jordan was arrogant and insensitive and did 
not understand the workings of congress 
an outsider to washington like sununu jordan also didnt work 
very hard at massaging huge congressional egos in fact he 
probably wouldnt have gotten into so much trouble if he hadnt 
slighted tip oneill on inauguration tickets back in 1977 
one budget negotiator speaking on the condition of anonymity 
said sununu a stamp collector sometimes annoyingly sat at the 
bargaining table leafing through stamp catalogues 
in one episode reported by the washington post sununu and 
darman put their nameplates along a row of chairs reserved for 
congressional leaders and that senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan moved them to the back of the table saying staff 
doesnt sit with the leadership 
dole may have more reason to resent sununu than most it was 
sununu who organized bushs new hampshire primary campaign that was 
the beginning of the end of doles 1988 presidential candidacy 
but bush shows no sign of losing confidence in either sununu or 
darman saying more republicans have praised than criticized them 
so what you hear is the squeaking wheel you hear those that 
arent particularly happy he said

remember the 1960s with its miniskirts hot 
pants shift dresses colorful prints and false eyelashes 
thirty years later the milanese have brought it all back in a 
sexier more brazen version hemlines are shorter hips tighter and 
breasts barer 
stretch cottons rayons and silks are the latest fabrics prints 
are not only painted on rich silk but also stitched together in a 
myriad of sparkling sequins 
in the makeup department eyes are as bright as a barbie dolls 
with lashes longer than liz taylor ever batted at richard burton 
during the 1961 filming of anthony and cleopatra 
the return of the dress is probably the most significant pickup 
from the 1960s especially for milan famous for its mantailored 
look 
in fact trousers have no place in the 1991 springsummer 
wardrobe legs are either bared by supershort hemlines and snug 
shorts or wrapped in skintight unitards 
the new version of the shift is shorter often rising to 
midthigh and tighter especially when in stretch fabric 
and there are lots of aline and trapeze dresses as well as 
halter top sun dresses for town and beach wear 
perhaps most successful at the 1990s style was krizia who 
showed her collection tuesday 
in this era of tough comeandgetit design the prettiness of 
the krizia collection was refreshing as was the music which 
accompanied the show nat king cole oldies 
shifts in demure floral silk prints adorned the first part of 
the show for the cocktail hour mariuccia mandelli the lady 
behind the krizia label offered white silk shifts trimmed with 
silver or simple silk apron dresses 
as the evening went on hemlines got shorter brushing the upper 
thigh micro hot pants and bra tops appeared as a reminder that the 
real 60s are behind us 
there have not been a lot of clothes to wear to work in the 
current collections unless your job is an aerobics teacher or a 
nightclub hostess 
therefore gennys neat trim navy blue suits spruced up with 
large gold buttons received grateful applause from fashion buyers 
worried about extravagant styles and shrinking pocketbooks 
genny also had a series of comfortable shifts in muted shades 
worn with matching duster jackets and accessoried with gold chain 
belts with a buckle in the shape of a sea star 
the mediterranean motifs starfish coral branches and sea 
plants appeared throughout the collection from patterns on daytime 
blouses to jewelry and belts to elaborate sequined prints on 
evening wear 
coral beads decorated simple black aline dresses while sea 
blues and greens provided the background for the glittery coral and 
starfish prints 
the genny collection displayed at the midpoint of the fiveday 
readytowear collections for next years warmer weather showed 
that the 1960s could be revived without going to avantgarde 
extremes such as the popart sequined jackets and fiery hot pants 
presented by gianni versace 
the showbiz designer was hailed as the maestro of the 1990s by 
fashion experts looking for inventive design 
but buyers worried by recession rising oil prices and a falling 
dollar were relieved to see some stylish sensible clothes 
the fashion crowd was waiting to see what gianfranco ferre has 
to say about all this in his new collection to be presented at the 
milan fairground site of most of the collections seen this week 
the final word on the 1960s styles with a 1990 sexy approach is 
reserved for giorgio armani father of milans tailored look whose 
collection closes the showings tonight

former fbi agent richard miller was convicted 
a second time of selling out his country to a soviet seductress for 
sex and promises of cash and gold 
us district judge robert takasugi who heard the case without 
a jury on tuesday rejected millers claim that he romanced 
svetlana ogorodnikov in a selfstyled attempt to infiltrate the 
kgb 
miller 54 is the only agent in fbi history to be convicted of 
espionage 
the conviction on charges of passing secrets to the soviets came 
after six years and three trials in which prosecutors portrayed him 
as a weak man lured into treason by lust and greed 
the jury at his first trial deadlocked and the guilty verdict at 
his second trial was overturned on grounds that lie detector 
evidence was improperly admitted 
miller who already has served five years in prison could get 
up to two life terms plus 50 years at sentencing jan 7 he was 
allowed to remain free on bail 
im dumbfounded i didnt expect this outcome i really 
didnt he said 
the judge conceded that miller may have first dreamed of using 
his romance with the soviet agent to infiltrate the kgb but he 
concluded that miller ultimately became the tool of mrs 
ogorodnikov a russian emigre 
in the battle of wills mr miller finally succumbed 
begrudgingly perhaps takasugi said he became entangled with 
svetlana and compromised his position in the fbi 
takasugi said the strongest evidence against miller was an fbi 
tape recording of miller and mrs ogorodnikov the judge said the 
conversation clearly demonstrated her dominance over the agent 
in that discussion miller was heard telling his lover youve 
stolen my heart to which mrs ogorodnikov responded thats my 
job 
assistant us attorney adam schiff said miller agreed to accept 
50000 in gold and 15000 in cash 
lawrence lawler agent in charge of the los angeles fbi office 
said the fbi assessment of damage from the spy scandal remains 
classified 
the relationship was not that old lawler said adding that 
damage could have been incalculable had it continued until 
today 
defense attorney joel levine had argued that the obese inept 
miller was an fbi misfit who tried to redeem a 20year career by 
infiltrating the kgb 
mr millers plan was procedurally flawed levine said 
but everything mr miller did in the fbi was procedurally 
flawed 
the prosecutor argued miller was ripe for recruitment when mrs 
ogorodnikov lured him with sex and money in 1984 by then he said 
miller had been repeatedly suspended for obesity he was plagued by 
financial problems had been excommunicated from the mormon church 
for adultery and his marriage was falling apart 
she was exotic to him schiff argued he slept with her 
because he was infatuated with her not because he was trying to 
infiltrate the kgb 
miller was arrested in 1984 the fbi claimed he had been about 
to flee the country with mrs ogorodnikov after passing her a 
classified fbi document titled the positive intelligence 
reporting guide 
mrs ogorodnikov who pleaded guilty and is serving an 18year 
term in federal prison did not testify at the third trial

the bush administration intends to condemn 
israel in the united nations for using excessive force against 
palestinian arabs in a melee outside the temple mount in jerusalem 
us officials say 
at least 19 arabs were killed and more than 100 wounded in a 
battle monday with israeli police eleven jews were hurt as well 
in a barrage of rocks and bottles hurled by arabs as the jews 
prayed at the western wall 
authorities in israel said the police had responded to 
rockthrowers who used the temple mount for violent activities but 
president bush said the police should have exercised more 
restraint and american diplomats framed the resolution condemning 
israeli security forces during daylong negotiations tuesday at the 
united nations 
it was uncertain when the vote would take place because the un 
security council did not convene tuesday night as scheduled 
diplomats reported scant progress in their search for a compromise 
the palestine liberation organization meanwhile rejected the 
us draft as too weak 
the united states rarely votes against israel in the security 
council two such instances were condemnation of israels 
destruction of iraqs nuclear facility near baghdad in 1981 and 
criticism of israels actions in lebanon in 1982 
much more often the united states stands with israel against 
what generally is considered by the two governments as unjustified 
or unfair criticism 
the resolution drafted by american diplomats was adopted by 
the four other permanent members of the un security council the 
soviet union china britain and france and is thus vetoproof 
said the us officials who spoke on condition of anonymity 
it condemns the violence that broke out monday and 
particularly the excessive israeli response one official said 
the resolution also welcomes a decision by un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar to send a delegation to 
jerusalem to investigate the incident 
the officials said the resolution calls on all parties to 
refrain from violence in a gesture to israel it expresses regret 
that worshipers also were attacked 
i am very very saddened by this needless loss of life bush 
said at a news conference tuesday 
he added israeli security forces need to be better prepared 
for such situations need to act with greater restraint 
particularly when it comes to the use of deadly force 
meanwhile the state department in a travel advisory suggested 
americans avoid the west bank and gaza because of recurrent 
disturbances in the territories 
a department notice said us citizens who must travel there 
should be aware of continuing unrest and tension including 
stonethrowing which can affect visitors 
at the united nations a representative from occupied kuwait 
joined iraq which annexed his country and more than 30 speakers 
in condemning israels treatment of palestinians and demanding that 
israeli withdraw from territories captured in the 1967 middle east 
war 
we know full well the bitterness and sufferings of the unarmed 
palestinian people under occupation because we are passing through 
a similar experience said sheik sabah alahmad aljaber alsabah 
of kuwait 
iraqs deputy permanent envoy sabah talat kadrat accused the 
united states and its allies of hypocrisy for shielding israel 
over the years and failing to condemn and punish israel for 
violence against palestinians 
during his news conference bush appealed for calm on all 
sides and three times referred to the palestine question as 
needing a solution previous presidents are not known to have used 
the phrase 
arabs and their supporters long have demanded the establishment 
of a state called palestine on israeliheld land bushs mideast 
policy deals with east jerusalem gaza and the west bank as 
occupied territory but has been opposed to palestinian statehood 
the president did not intend to signal anything with the phrase 
and there is no change in policy said roman popadiuk a deputy 
white house press secretary 
bush also said iraqi president saddam hussein should not use 
this unfortunate incident to link his occupation and annexation 
of kuwait and its oil fields with the israelipalestinian dispute

president bush says he doesnt want to submit 
his presidency to the psychiatrists couch but he agrees that he 
finds it more satisfying to deal with a foreign crisis than one 
closer to home 
the president conceded for example that he was more 
comfortable putting together the coalition of nations that confront 
saddam hussein in the persian gulf than horsetrading with congress 
on a deficit solution 
bush offered his observations at a news conference tuesday when 
he was asked why do you think youre so much more comfortable 
with and better at foreign matters than domestic 
the questioner continued to some people it seems like almost 
two presidents 
ive read that sophisticated analysis bush replied and 
im troubled because i dont really know the answer to it 
he said he did not want to get stretched out on the couch too 
far in terms of analysis of his conduct of the presidency but he 
didnt quarrel with the questioners proposition 
people really basically want to support the president on 
foreign affairs and partisanship does in a sense stop at the 
waters edge bush said whereas on domestic policy here i am 
with democratic majorities in the senate and democratic majorities 
in the house having to try to persuade them to do what i think is 
best 
on the persian gulf crisis he said he enjoyed trying to put 
the coalition together and keep it together and work towards what i 
think is a proper end seeing that this aggression doesnt succeed 
i cant say i just rejoice every time i go up and talk to 
danny rostenkowski my dear friend about what hes going to do on 
taxes rostenkowski is an illinois democrat who chairs the house 
ways and means committee 
bushs questioner commented it doesnt sound like you have as 
much fun with a domestic problem than with the other the 
president replied thats about right

even death couldnt free some workers 
from their bosses archaeologists are finding in a newly discovered 
cemetery near the pyramids 
its the first burial ground ever found for the egyptian working 
man of 45 centuries ago 
five other cemeteries with 4000 tombs flank the pyramids on 
the horizon above but all 4000 were reserved for royalty their 
families and officials said zahi hawass directorgeneral of 
antiquities for the pyramids area and the new digs excavation 
chief 
what we havent found until now is the working class said 
hawass we were shocked when we looked at inscriptions of who was 
buried in the new tombs overseers holding their sticks and 
behind skeletons of workers 
he said it appears the workers were members of the foremens 
crews 
the first eight tombs three miles south of the sphinx lie at 
the base of sand hills stretching endlessly into the desert hawass 
said the cemetery undoubtedly extends deep into the dunes 
tombs date from the fourth dynasty 4600 years ago when the 
giza pyramids were built until the sixth 300 years later its a 
mysterious period when legend says workers grew tired of almighty 
pharaohs and of building pyramids for them 
because no middleclass burials had been discovered on sacred 
giza plateau some egyptologists have theorized that the afterlife 
was perceived as offlimits to the working man but the new 
cemetery proves that pharaonic bluecollar workers prepared for 
eternity as their betters did being buried with amulets limestone 
tablets offering tables pottery vessels and more 
the largest tomb built for a fifthdynasty overseer named 
ptahshepses is 20 feet by 6 feet with an arched ceiling 
to the rear of the tomb in a honeycomb of compartments 
excavators found six skeletons buried in the fetal position hawass 
said they were members of one work crew 
ancient egyptians didnt practice human sacrifice so the 
workers were not killed and buried at the same time as their 
bosses and hawass said theres no indication so far how a foreman 
chose the workers to be buried near him 
perhaps they were his favorites or perhaps well find others 
when we keep digging hawass said we have no idea how many 
people an overseer would have had on his staff 
foremen handled daytoday administration of the pharaohs 
estates with responsibilities comparable to farm managers or 
assemblyline supervisors in todays world they dressed better 
ate better and wanted better tombs than the men who worked for 
them hawass said 
they looked at the pyramids and the fancy tombs of the 
officials they knew they couldnt afford such luxury still they 
wanted a nice place to spend eternity 
more information about the ancient bluecollar workers will come 
from medical tests egyptian doctors are performing on the 
skeletons data is expected to indicate the workers general 
appearance their height and weight what they ate what diseases 
bothered them even what killed them 
in 1987 hawass and egyptologist mark lehner of yale university 
began a search for homes of workers who built the three giza 
pyramids at a site some distance from the monuments they 
uncovered ruins of a business center and other artifacts 
they stopped excavating in early 1988 the recently discovered 
tombs lay undetected only a few feet away 
but early last summer a tourist hired a saddle horse for a ride 
around the pyramids during the tour her horse fell through the 
sand ending on top of what proved to be the roof of the first 
tomb 
nobody got the tourists name and chances are she still doesnt 
know her outing made history 
for years riders heading for the most spectacular view of the 
pyramids have passed in front of the sphinx and through an ancient 
stone gate into the desert 
no records existed to explain the gate 
but once we found the cemetery we understood hawass said 
the gate divided the world of the pharaohs from the world of the 
average man 
he explained that the foremen and their crews lived and were 
buried in their own world behind the gate by day they passed 
through the gate into their pharaohs sacred world then returned 
at sunset to work on their own tombs

rep lynn martins media adviser called 
democratic sen paul simon a weenie and said he was slimy 
simon has slandered martin by running tv ads that say the 
former teacher is an enemy of senior citizens and schools said 
roger ailes the ad man who formerly worked for president bushs 
campaign 
ailes acknowledged tuesday that martin voted against increasing 
medicare spending and against lowering the rate of outofpocket 
costs but these were not votes to cut medicare 
simon is just being simon which is unfortunately being 
slimy ailes said at a news conference

rwandas rare mountain gorillas do not 
appear endangered by a guerrilla insurgency and may even benefit 
if the fighting scares off tourists who in large numbers can 
threaten the animals health conservationists say 
since the rebels invaded the central african nation from 
neighboring uganda late last month the gorillas habitat the 
setting for the 1988 movie gorillas in the mist has remained 
calm 
fighting has been concentrated in the north and northeast and in 
the capital kigali 75 miles southeast of the volcanic virunga 
mountains where the worlds remaining 310 mountain gorillas live 
we are working on the basis that this will not alter the 
existing conservation programs a spokesman for the main 
international wildlife consortium operating in rwanda said by 
telephone 
the kenyabased consortium includes the africa wildlife 
foundation the flora and fauna preservation society and the 
worldwide fund for nature 
it withdrew its foreign staff from rwanda in january as part of 
plans to form a new joint body to cover the gorillas entire 
remaining natural habitat along the borders with uganda and zaire 
revenue from gorillagazing tourists is rwandas thirdlargest 
source of income but conservationists have expressed concern over 
the governments desire to increase the size of tourist parties 
allowed into the narrow 25mile strip of forest on foot 
they argue that the present system of four groups of six 
tourists per day is the maximum both the gorillas and the ecology 
can stand 
with an entry fee to the nature preserve of 200 per person the 
government wants to increase the size of the groups to eight people 
each per day with an even larger number during the peak midyear 
holiday season 
its tempting but it really is a question of whether you want 
kill the goose that lays the golden egg said rosalind eveling of 
the africa wildlife foundation in nairobi we are dealing with a 
very fragile resource 
groups of up to eight tourists were taken into the forest during 
the peak season this year but they were later reduced to the 
original limit of six 
we would be very concerned if they put it up again from an 
economic point of view they also risk destroying the elite 
experience of seeing the gorillas she added 
because the treks on foot take several hours tourists already 
are allowed to hire african bearers to carry cameras packed 
lunches and extra clothing 
according to conservation literature distributed by american 
anthropologist dian fosseys digit fund the gorillas risk catching 
human illnesses from visitors or from their garbage such as 
eggshells and fruit peels 
the fund says the rare primates are close enough biologically to 
humans to be susceptible particularly to human parasites passed in 
urine and feces tourists with contagious illnesses should never be 
allowed into the parc des vulcans says the fund 
fossey portrayed in gorillas in the mist was mysteriously 
murdered in her mountain hut in 1985 while she worked to save the 
animals from poachers the digit fund an englewood colobased 
organization is named after a slain gorilla fossey knew for its 
twisted finger 
fossey got to know many gorilla families making them 
approachable to within the reach of a human arm although touching 
them is strictly prohibited today 
for many years the 200pound growling chestbeating gorillas 
were thoght of in the west as king kongs but fossey discovered 
they are gentle and understanding and only attack when provoked 
says the fund 
the rebels who invaded sept 30 belong mostly to rwandas 
minority tutsi ethnic group they were chased from power three 
decades ago by the majority hutu tribe in clan fighting that killed 
tens of thousands of people 
the rebels accuse president juvenal habyarimana of abuse of 
power and corruption and say they want to install a democratic 
government

congressional investigators are rejecting a 
protest from attorney general dick thornburgh and continuing their 
examination of secret loans to iraq from an italian banks atlanta 
office 
the congress has the supremacy of the right to know and obtain 
information rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the 
house banking committee said tuesday 
thornburgh told gonzalez in a sept 26 letter that taking public 
testimony from prosecutors and potential witnesses in the banca 
nazionale del lavoro case could jeopardize the justice departments 
criminal investigation 
he expressed his profound disappointment that gonzalez had 
ignored his departments strong objections and scheduled a 
hearing for oct 16 
this is a sensitive case with national security concerns 
thornburgh wrote 
gonzalez replied tuesday that the case involves a serious 
regulatory breakdown and could cost the us government hundreds 
of millions of dollars because it had guaranteed some of the loans 
he said the committee would base its investigation on publicly 
available information and said the administrations reluctance to 
cooperate represented fear of embarrassment more than anything 
else 
according to gonzalez the atlanta office of the romebased 
institution approved 29 billion in unauthorized loans to iraq 
during and just after its war with iran about 18 billion was 
actually disbursed 
the activity went undetected by georgia banking regulators and 
examiners from the federal reserve bank of atlanta and was not 
stopped until august 1989 when the fbi raided the office 
the state banking agency responsible fell asleep at the 
switch and the federal reserve was found asleep at the same 
switch gonzalez charged 
these unauthorized loans increased iraqs credit capacity and 
permitted iraq to spend more of their scant hard currency on the 
very weapons now aimed at our children he said 
now repayment is in doubt and us taxpayers may end up owing 
the italian bank between 400 million and 600 million according 
to the banking committees staff the agriculture departments 
commodity credit corp had guaranteed a portion of the loans which 
were used to purchase us farm products 
state and federal regulators are scheduled to appear before the 
committee next week gonzalez said he would like to subpoena other 
witnesses but he could not on tuesday because only he and three 
others on the 51member panel attended a meeting to hear a staff 
aides outline the case the house had been in session until early 
morning working on budget legislation 
gonzalez said the banca nazionale del lavoro affair raises 
larger questions about whether us laws are able to prevent 
foreign governments from carrying out their policies through the 
american banking system 
foreign banks now own more than 520 billion or 22 percent of 
us banking assets he said 
banca nazionale del lavoro is primarily owned by the italian 
government and is italys secondlargest bank it fired most of its 
employees in atlanta and maintains the iraqi loans were recorded 
only on a secret set of books it has said the loans were 
unauthorized either by its regional headquarters in new york or by 
top bank officials in rome 
however dennis m kane a banking panel aide said an internal 
audit obtained by the committee showed bank officials in new york 
were aware of discrepancies in the atlanta offices books by the 
end of 1988 yet failed to inform federal or state regulators 
italian legislators are investigating the case from rome where 
it is referred to as iraqgate

president bush says american business is 
making progress toward driving drug abuse out of the workplace and 
the community at large 
its almost like some of you are adopting the communities in 
which you live and its a wonderful thing bush told top 
executives gathered tuesday for a briefing from the administration 
on drugs in the workplace 
now many corporations fighting to make the workplace and the 
larger community drugfree are exactly what we talk about when we 
talk about this concept points of light bush said referring to 
his volunteerism campaign 
he told the business leaders that the fight against drugs in the 
workplace represents more than merely a dogood project 
its smart business and it is indeed in many instances the 
key to our economic survival he said 
to maintain our edge in an increasingly sophisticated 
international economy our workers have got to be literate and 
welltrained and indeed drug free the president said and so 
when i talk about competitiveness now i talk about the workplace 
being drugfree 
he said there were countless ways in which corporate america 
can make a real difference in the communities in helping them be 
drugfree 
there are counseling and treatment programs in the workplace 
for drugdependent workers he said education programs show 
employees how to avoid the temptation of drugs 
bush described as outstanding the job that national drug 
policy director william bennett has done he said the 
administration has done its part in the campaign by strengthening 
interdiction efforts supporting law enforcement and expanding 
treatment efforts 
the president said however that the government alone will 
never be able to win the war against drugs 
it simply cannot be he said and so we have to enlist the 
aid of every corporation

governors and bush administration officials 
disagree over the need for a national exam to keep track of 
students academic performance but favor giving schools a list of 
what students should know in each subject 
colorado gov roy romer insisted tuesday that assessment can be 
used to promote true educational reform in the united states but 
stopped short of endorsing the idea of national testing in america 
south carolina gov carroll a campbell jr said states need to 
know how their students compare with each other but missouri gov 
john ashcroft said statebystate comparisons could be made without 
national uniform tests 
the governors led the discussions during the inaugural meeting 
of a bipartisan panel created this summer to assess and report on 
progress to achieve national goals to improve education 
education secretary lauro cavazos and white house domestic 
policy chief roger porter were the administrations representatives 
but top congressional leaders were absent because of budget battles 
on capitol hill 
the idea of national testing already is being discussed by the 
presidents advisory committee on education policy but some 
educators argue that education is a local and state responsibility 
and a national test would destroy the tradition 
can we help each school building in america arrive at 
better assessment i think the answer is yes said romer 
chairman of the education goals panel but we need to be cautious 
and careful about how we do it 
one of the initial steps we can help with is to say this 
is what you need to know and this is what you need to be able to do 
and then we can leave it to the school to design its own 
curriculum he said 
romer said experts generally agree for instance that there are 
specific things students should know for various levels of 
mathematics 
porter said the panel must search for ways to measure competency 
without federal testing he said an appropriate approach would be 
to establish a national reporting system while maintaining local 
assessments that can allow statebystate comparisons 
indiana gov evan bayh agreed with porter on that approach 
i would say it is not necessary to have a national uniform 
test to demonstrate proficiency in certain skills said 
missouris ashcroft we do want to be able to assess our own 
performance against the rest of the country not necessarily 
nationally uniform 
campbell insisted that states need to be able to compare 
students progress he said comparisons would be difficult if there 
are wide varieties of student assessments and tests 
states need to know where they stand nationally to compare 
apples and apples instead of apples and oranges said the south 
carolina governor who took part in developing the national goals 
our state is a struggling state but if we struggle only 
against ourselves were not going to go anywhere campbell said 
i think i need to know what tests results are in missouri 
california and i need to know where our students compare

a surrogate mother established a 
physical and emotional bond during pregnancy that entitles her to 
custody of a baby that is genetically unrelated a psychiatrist 
testified 
the natural mother is the woman who gives birth to the child 
and that includes whether or not the child is of her genetic 
origins dr michelle harrison said tuesday at a custody hearing 
over a 3weekold boy 
ms harrison testified on behalf of anna johnson in ms 
johnsons dispute with the babys genetic parents mark and 
crispina calvert the superior court hearing was to continue today 
the calverts had hired ms johnson to carry their baby for 
10000 and supplied the sperm and egg but ms johnson decided to 
back out of the deal 
the case may set precedent because the surrogate has no genetic 
link to the baby the landmark baby m case in new jersey involved a 
surrogate who was also the genetic mother 
attorneys say the california case could result in a ruling on 
what constitutes parenthood the genetic link or the act of giving 
birth 
ms johnson has said that she became attached to the baby and 
that the calverts neglected her and the pregnancy the calverts 
have accused her of being motivated by money and publicity they 
have custody in the meantime 
psychologist david chamberlain vice president of the prenatal 
and perinatal psychology association of america also testified for 
the surrogate he said nothing could be closer than a baby in 
utero and the birth mother 
but when asked by the calverts attorney christian van deusen 
whether the couple have a right to their own offspring he 
responded yes 
ms harrison a teacher at the univrsity of pittsburgh and 
consultant to the national coalition against surrogacy counseled 
johnson by telephone during her pregnancy 
ms harrison questioned about ms johnsons twice weekly visits 
with the baby said ms johnson believes the boy recognizes her by 
smell feels safe with her and attempts to nurse 
however ms harrison she could not judge either sides 
attachment to the child because she has never seen either the 
surrogate or the calverts with the boy 
ms johnson who worked with mrs calvert at a santa ana 
hospital was hired by the couple to bear their child because a 
hysterectomy prevents mrs calvert from carrying a baby

20000 checks over the next three years under an entitlement 
program enacted by congress

prejudice wartime hysteria and a failure of political 
leadership

to begin paying compensation beginning with the oldest and ending 
with the youngest survivors of the detention

sexual harassment of female students at the 
naval academy is widespread and some victims dont complain openly 
for fear of reprisal according to an internal academy report 
in such a climate it is not surprising that some midshipmen 
have lost the ability to distinguish a blatant incident of sexual 
harassment from routine pranks said the report released tuesday 
the report by a sevenmember panel of academy faculty military 
staff and midshipmen said immediate action is needed to correct the 
conditions allowing mistreatment of women 
most midshipmen readily acknowledge women midshipmen are not 
accepted as equals in the academy said the report by the 
academys women midshipmen study group this lack of acceptance 
has created an environment in which steady lowlevel sexual 
harassment passes as normal operating procedure in many areas and 
classrooms alike 
the report was one of several special inquiries prompted by a 
hazing incident at the academy last december in which a female 
student was handcuffed by male midshipmen to a urinal as other men 
jeered and took photographs the woman gwen m dreyer a 
secondyear student resigned from the academy last may citing her 
humiliation and anger at the way the academy responded to it 
at the pentagon navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii said 
prompt action will be forthcoming to address the concerns 
raised by the inquiry reports

commercial health insurance companies spend 14 
times as much on overhead as the federal medicare program and 11 
times as much as the canadian national health care system 
according to a private group 
if the private health insurance industry were as efficient as 
medicare about 13 billion could be saved and used to provide 
insurance to 11 million uninsured people concluded the report 
issued tuesday by citizen action 
competition in the insurance market is wasteful and 
expensive said robert brandon vice president of the group in 
health care a free market cannot work what we need is a 
singlepayer system where the government is the sole insurer 
the health insurance association of america said citizen 
actions study was misleading because it did not include blue cross 
and blue shield plans or plans sponsored by large selfinsured 
companies 
the association also said that private insurers are spending an 
increasing amount of money to make sure doctors and hospitals 
bills are appropriate 
citizen actions report showed that in 1988 commercial health 
insurance companies spent 335 cents on administration marketing 
commissions and other overhead expenses for every dollar in claims 
paid out 
by comparison medicares administrative costs were 23 cents 
per dollar in claims paid out in the canadian health care system 
administrative costs amounted to about 3 cents per dollar in claims 
paid the group said 
the industry association said that if blue cross and blue shield 
and selfinsured plans are factored in the 1988 administrative 
costs in the private sector drop to 13 cents for each dollar of 
benefits paid 
private insurance companies in their efforts to compete for 
more business spend money on things that are not necessary when 
coverage is provided by a single public program the group said 
one of these functions is the internal review required to deny 
claims 
incredibly the commercial insurance way of paying for health 
care leaves americans spending more to deny people coverage than it 
would cost to provide everyone with coverage the report said 
citizen action is a nonprofit consumers rights group with 
affiliates in 30 states

the defense in the 2 live crew 
obscenity trial contends there arent enough blacks and young 
people among the prospective jurors 
three of the first 25 potential jurors questioned monday and 
tuesday were black and one was under 25 said bruce rogow attorney 
for the three members of the black rap group arrested for 
performing songs from an album pronounced obscene 
jury selection was to continue today 
you dont have to be a genius to look at this jury pool and 
see thats not what broward county looks like rogow said 
the makeup of the jury is particularly important because 
obscenity cases depend on how the jury defines community standards 
in addition rap music is aimed primarily at a black audience and 
the rap group and its defenders have claimed the case smacks of 
racism 
rogow challenged broward countys voterbased jury pool as 
unconstitutional in cases like obscenity that depend on community 
standards judge june johnson said she wanted to see the whole 
70person pool before ruling on the challenge 
meanwhile prosecutors tuesday lost a bid to have the judge 
removed from the case on grounds that rogow was her law professor 
at nova university 15 years ago johnson refused to step down 
saying she had lost touch with rogow since then 
luther campbell chris wongwon and mark ross were charged after 
they performed songs from as nasty as they wanna be on june 11 
at an adultsonly show at a hollywood club days before a federal 
judge ruled the album obscene 
if convicted the miamibased rappers could get up to a year in 
jail and a 1000 fine 
rogow also represented charles freeman a black record store 
owner convicted of obscenity last week by an allwhite jury for 
selling as nasty as they wanna be 
most obscenity cases are argued on the us supreme courts 
miller v california test it holds that material is obscene if the 
average person applying local community standards would find that 
it is designed to cause sexual arousal depicts sex in a patently 
offensive way and if taken as a whole lacks serious literary 
artistic political or scientific value 
i need young people and black people campbell said of the 
jury pool

pakistan tried three times this year to buy 
from a new jersey company hightemperature furnaces useful for 
making nuclear weapons a congressional source said wednesday 
night 
this source confirmed an account in wednesday editions of the 
washington post which said it had obtained documents of an 
unspecified nature given to administration officials and 
congressional investigators describing pakistans attempt to buy 
the furnaces from consarc corp of rancocas nj 
the confirming source had not read the documents but they had 
been described to him he spoke on condition that his name not be 
used 
the newspapers account said the furnaces were more 
sophisticated versions of consarc furnaces whose export to iraq was 
approved over the summer the iraqi shipment was stopped at the 
last minute 
according to the newspaper pakistan tried through its embassy 
in france and through intermediaries in france and switzerland to 
buy the consarc furnaces either directly or through consarcs 
british subsidiary 
the inability to obtain export licenses from us or british 
authorities was said to have prevented the sale 
in the canadian approach the manufacture of surgical 
instruments was given as the intended use of the furnaces 
a consarc salesman manfred dickersbach was quoted as saying in 
one document that the material to be processed appears to be 
zirconium 
zirconium is used to clad uranium fuel in nuclear reactors fuel 
for power reactors comes from suppliers already clad 
irradiated with neutrons in the reactor the uranium would be 
transformed into plutonium from which nuclear weapons may be made 
more easily than with uranium 
pakistan is believed to have taken steps to make a uranium bomb 
also 
pakistan has steadfastly denied making nuclear weapons congress 
has required that the bush administration certify that pakistan 
does not possess a nuclear weapon before pakistan may receive us 
aid 
the administration has approached congressional leaders on the 
issue about the possibility of waiving the requirement this fiscal 
year which began oct 1 congress is reluctant and officially 
the state department says no decision has been made on what to do 
in islamabad a foreign ministry spokesman said reports that 
pakistan was trying to buy hightemperature furnaces came as a 
surprise and questioned their veracity 
these kinds of stories always come out when we have problems 
with certification its uncanny and they are later 
disproved said a spokesman who could not be identified under 
usual briefing rules 
there is no reason why there shouldnt be certification this 
year said the foreign office spokesman

a us company says it refused to sell 
pakistan hightemperature furnaces that can be used in making 
nuclear weapons because it was suspicious of the countrys 
intentions 
raymond robrts president of consarc corp of rancocas said 
wednesday the company was approached at least twice by pakistan 
the end use that they wished was to produce zirconium and 
thats a metal that has principally nuclear enduses roberts 
said in a telephone interview from his home we know that the 
us government has concerns with pakistan and nuclear weapons so 
we elected not to pursue a potential sale 
among other things the furnaces can also be used to make 
surgical steel 
a governmentapproved sale of lesssophisticated consarc 
furnaces to iraq this summer was stopped at the last minute 
pakistan approached consarc and its british subsidiary early 
this year with a request to buy the arc melting furnaces which 
cost about 3 million each roberts said 
about the same time a canadian company made a similar request 
leading consarc to believe that pakistan was behind that request as 
well he said 
in pakistan a foreign ministry spokesman who could not be 
identified under the briefing rules said these kinds of stories 
always come out when we have problems with certification its 
uncanny and they are later disproved

gunmen opened fire with automatic 
weapons on a bus killing six blacks and wounding 27 in the second 
random attack around this indian ocean city in less than 24 hours 
police said today 
police spokesman lt bala naidoo said the public bus was 
traveling just outside durban late tuesday when it was attacked by 
unidentired gunmen police said they had no motive for the attack 
and no one had been arrested 
earlier tuesday a group of about 20 knifewielding blacks 
stabbed eight whites when they went on a rampage on a street near 
the beachfront 
seven suspects were arrested including the alleged leader who 
was shot by police authorities said the 26yearold leader 
appeared to be a religious zealot who had recruited his followers 
hours earlier at an allnight vigil on the durban beach 
he told the others that 1990 would be the year blacks obtained 
freedom in south africa police added 
the gang stole knives from a store speacializing in weapons from 
the far east and then began stabbing people along a street near the 
beach police and witnesses said 
we have come to take over this place the alleged leader was 
quoted as saying by witnesses 
some in the gang wore badges of the pan africanist congress a 
militant black opposition group but the attack was not believed to 
be politically motivated police said 
eight whites ranging in age from 15 to 85 were hospitalized 
with stab wounds barkhuizen said 
law and order minister adriaan vlok condemned the violence and 
called for private citizens to refrain from seeking vengeance 
thabo mbeki a top official for the african national congress 
said the attack might have been orchestrated by somebody trying 
to provoke a reaction from the white population 
despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in south 
africa there have been few cases of blacks randomly attacking 
whites 
some 5000 blacks have been killed in factionalfighting since 
1986 in natal province which includes durban but the violence has 
been almost exclusively in black areas pitting zulu supporters of 
the conservative inkatha movement against xhosas and other blacks 
linked to the anc

pierre cardin who invented bubble dresses and 
revolutionized paris with the first readytowear collection is 
the first of his contemporaries to have a retrospective at the 
victoria and albert museum 
the 68yearold fashion pioneer returned briefly to the past 
tuesday when selections from his 40year career went on display at 
the museum known in part for its extensive clothing collections of 
various periods 
it was very emotional he said to see nearly 100 models 
dressed in bubble and balloon dresses of the 50s unisex spaceage 
styles and vinyl minis of the 60s pagodasleeve jackets and 
asymmetrical skirts of the 70s and hooped evening minidresses and 
computerinspired coats of the 80s 
but while cardin was the first of his contemporaries to be so 
honored at the museum his mind was very much on the future he 
says he wants to expand his empire from 102 countries to the entire 
world 
i have very big ambition i dont stop id like to 
prove myself again cardin said today my ambition is to work 
very hard with china with russia with indonesia and malaysia 
today we are looking at vietnam and north korea 
born in venice and reared in france cardin worked with renowned 
parisian designers paquin and schiaparelli after world war ii and 
then joined christian dior in 1947 just after he started his own 
company the retrospective includes a suit he said he made as part 
of diors new look 
in 1950 cardin started his own house showing his first 
collection in 1953 and establishing himself as an important figure 
in french haute couture 
my first show i sold 300000 of one red coat he recalled 
it was the beginning of my career 
but his big breakthrough came in 1959 when he presented a 
readytowear collection for women and was swiftly expelled by the 
chambre syndicale de la couture the select couturiers club 
i was looking at readytowear why i said can only the 
rich people dress with haute couture cardin recalled it 
was the beginning of my fortune in this moment because my house 
was the first to offer readytowear and in germany in japan 
france and america it was immediately successful 
after that cardin branched out into licensing currently he 
said 800 factories employ more than 180000 people producing 
cardin brand name goods ranging from perfume and chocolates to 
frying pans and shoes 
put end to end the ties i sell every year would go round the 
globe twice over he was quoted as telling the observer 
newspaper 
in 1970 he said he bought a theater in paris because when i 
was young i wanted to be an actor or dancer in 1981 he bought 
the famous paris restaurant maxims so he could see beautiful men 
and women dining there in designer clothes after that it was 
hotels 
estimates of retail revenue from cardinstamped products range 
between 12 billion and 2 billion annually cardins personal 
income is estimated at between 20 million and 50 million a year 
and forbes magazine calls him the richest designer in the world 
i love money he was quoted as saying in the telegraph 
weekend magazine i do not believe there has ever been a name as 
important as pierre cardin in the general history of couture 
cardin said he saw fashion partly as designs to be worn today 
partly as creations for the future 
the body is liquid material and i put it in a dress the body 
is like a vase and i put the water in it he said describing his 
fashion philosophy other designers follow the body for me the 
body doesnt exist its the shape that counts 
the retrospective runs until jan 6

sen joseph bidens republican 
challenger is dusting off videotape on a plagiarism controversy 
that wrecked bidens democratic run for president in 1988 
prosecutor m jane brady who trails badly said she is playing 
the character card with a 10minute videotape to be mailed next 
week to about 40000 homes 
the videotape including material used against biden two years 
ago shows biden using lines from the late robert kennedy and 
british labor party leader neil kinnock 
biden quit the 1988 presidential race after it was revealed that 
he borrowed from kinnock and others without attribution lifted 
from a law review article for a legal brief while in law school and 
inflated his standing in his law school class 
john sasso an aide to democrat michael dukakis during the 1988 
presidential campaign resigned after admitting he leaked a 
videotape on bidens kinnocklike remarks 
bidens campaign staff said brady broke her word to avoid 
negative campaigning with use of the videotape put together by the 
national republican senate campaign 
i dont believe that voters who see this again will be 
concerned because the record has been set straight that i 
repeatedly quoted kinnock previously and never intended to 
appropriate his words without attribution biden said 
the videotape also shows an exchange biden had with a man at a 
political function over bidens claim about his law school class 
standing 
the video which cost bradys campaign 75000 uses material 
from network television and the public affairs tv channel cspan

the mayor of trenton nj has rejected a visit by 
a japanese group studying garbage disposal methods because of a 
cabinet ministers remarks comparing blacks with prostitutes 
japanese news reports said today 
the tokyo metropolitan assembly had asked trenton to accept the 
visit in late october but mayor douglas palmer refused because of 
the remarks last month by justice minister seiroku kajiyama kyodo 
news service reported 
for the city of trenton with a large black population and a 
black mayor kajiyamas remarks were unbearable kyodo quoted 
palmer as saying in a letter palmer said the visit should wait 
until anger in trenton has eased the news agency added 
officials of the metropolitan assembly were not available for 
comment because of a national holiday in japan 
on sept 21 following a police roundup of foreign prostitutes 
in tokyo kajiyama said such prostitutes ruin the atmosphere of 
neighborhoods they move into 
its like in america when neighborhoods become mixed because 
blacks move in and whites are forced out he said 
the remarks provoked protests in the united states and japan 
kajiyama later apologized and retracted them 
otherremarks by japanese politicians in recent years also have 
angered american minorities 
in 1986 then prime minister yasuhiro nakasone said on the 
average the united states is lower in intellectual level because 
of a considerable number of blacks puerto ricans and mexicans 
in 1988 michio watanabe policy chief of the governing liberal 
democratic party said american blacks have few qualms about going 
bankrupt and implied they walk away from their debts 
the team from the tokyo metropolitan assembly planned to set out 
next monday for a twoweek study on environment and housing

art historians are split over a doctors theory 
that michelangelos creation of adam on the sistine chapel 
ceiling contains a huge image of a brain symbolizing god endowing 
man with intelligence 
dr frank lynn meshberger contends the fresco has been 
misunderstood since it was created in 1512 the painting was 
covered with dirt until a recent restoration so it might have 
been difficult to visualize a brain he said 
the painting shows adam and god reaching toward one another 
arms outstretched fingers almost touching god has his arm around 
eve and angels lookon god and the angels form the shape of the 
brain meshberger said 
meshberger a gynecologist at st johns medical center in 
anderson ind said in todays journal of the american medical 
association that michelangelo intended to symbolize god giving man 
intellect rather than life as commonly believed 
kathleen weilgarris brandt a fine arts professor at new york 
university and a consultant for renaissance art at the vatican 
museum disputed meshbergers theory as a retrofit of his own 
knowledge 
all the elements in the image have profound traditional roots 
in the visual culture of the renaissance and middle ages she 
said god is more than a flying brain 
other art historians are reluctant to dismiss the theory noting 
that artists and scientists of the time studied sections of the 
brain 
meshberger said he learned through his research that 
michelangelo had deep religious beliefs and dissected cadavers to 
study the human form for his art 
the idea of god being equated with the mind is quite 
attractive said graham smith who specializes in 16thcentury 
art at the university of michigan in ann arbor 
lynn orr curator of european art at the fine arts museums of 
san francisco said anybody can look at artwork and say oh 
that means such and such to me but thats one of the wonderful 
things about art 
i guess the thing to do now is for a bunch of people to look 
at the picture carefully to see if it really does look like a 
brain she said 
meshberger said the theory came to him after he dissected and 
drew a brain in medical school in 1969 he said he saw a threepage 
foldout photograph of the painting in a magazine and had a 
tremendous sense of deja vu 
i like to think of it as a brainstorm he joked 
meshberger said he waited 20 years to publish an article on it 
because he was establishing himself as a doctor and had little time 
to research michelangelo 
meshberger said that the painting also includes a representation 
of the vertebral artery which feeds blood to the brain and that a 
cleftfooted angel forms the two lobes of the pituitary gland 
for centuries after the fresco was created art lovers did not 
have the benefit of clear photography and artists who would have 
had access to the painting generally were not skilled in the study 
of anatomy the doctor said 
for someone to make this observation you would have had to 
travel to rome to the sistine chapel stand on the floor and look 
up at a ceiling about 65 feet away he said

students wielding clubs and firebombs 
fought with riot police today who responded with tear gas and 
stormed two universities to block the screening of banned movies 
from communist north korea 
police beefed up security around intelligence offices after 
radicals firebombed an intelligence office in the southern city of 
chonju early today no serious damage or injuries were reported 
police arrested about 50 dissidents who tried to march toward 
the police commands headquarters near president roh taewoos 
residence to demand that military intelligence be overhauled to end 
its political operations 
antigovernment protests intensified after last weeks reports 
of illegal spying on civilians by the defense security command a 
military intelligence unit 
as part of their antigovernment tactics radical students tried 
to screen north korean movies which encourage revolution before 
police moved in to stop the efforts 
in downtown seoul about 2000 riot police were deployed around 
a catholic cathedral to block an evening rally by dissidents 
meanwhile opposition leader kim daejungs hunger strike 
continued for a third day at his party headquarters he was backed 
up by about 400 supporters who were staging sitins in 20 local 
offices 
kim began fasting monday to demand dissolution of the security 
command economic reform and the scrapping of government plans to 
change the form of government from presidential to parliamentary 
the latest political turmoil began last week after an army 
private released classified documents he said showed the military 
intelligence unit illegally spied on more than 1300 dissidents 
intellectuals and opposition legislators 
roh fired his defense minister and the chief of military 
intelligence monday seeking to minimize the impact of the most 
serious scandal since he took office in early 1988 
but opponents joined forces to mount a major campaign against 
roh a former general who once headed the security command after 
helping former president chun doohwan seize power in 1980 
roh has vowed to end military intervention in politics his 
party gained control of twothirds of the 299member national 
assembly in january by merging with two minor opposition groups 
rohs opponents contend the merger is a government attempt to 
prolong power all opposition legislators resigned from parliament 
en masse in august accusing the government of railroading 
legislation through the assembly and curtailing democratic reforms

discussions of higher taxes on the wealthy in 
exchange for lower taxes on capital gains have focused on an oddity 
in the law the socalled bubble that finds the rate on the top 
tax bracket lower than in the bracket immediately before it 
that means the wealthiest people pay a lower rate on extra 
dollars of income than do some earning slightly less 
thus a person with 1 million income can win a 10000 lottery 
and owe the government an additional 2800 a 28 percent tax 
rate but a person with 50000 income can hit the same lottery and 
owe 3300 
currently single taxpayers face a tax rate of 15 percent on the 
first 19450 of taxable income a 28 percent rate applies to the 
next segment of inome between 19450 and 47050 income between 
47050 and 97620 is taxed at 33 percent 
any taxable income above 97620 is taxed at 28 percent but 
before that lower rate kicks in a taxpayer will have lost any 
benefit from a personal exemption and from having some income taxed 
at the lowest 15 percent rate 
similarly for married taxpayers with no children and filing 
joint returns the first 32450 is taxed at 15 percent income 
between 32450 and 78400 is taxed at 28 percent taxable income 
between 78400 and 162770 faces a 33 percent rate 
any income above 162770 is taxed at 33 percent 
the bubble is not an accident congress invented it in 1986 
in an effort to prevent any person from paying more than 28 percent 
of taxable income to the government 
even so some people can pay more than 29 percent

the last menonly dining club at 
princeton university has voted to stay that way despite a state 
supreme court order requiring it to admit female members 
the vote tuesday by undergraduate members of the tiger inn also 
reverses the clubs decision earlier this year to admit women and 
end a 100yearold tradition 
we all believe the right to freedom of association is an 
important and fundamental aspect of life at any age said 
stockton s williams undergraduate president of the tiger inn 
in february the tiger inn voted to admit women however club 
rules say women can be admitted only if undergraduate members vote 
them in for two consecutive school years 
the club said the earlier vote was taken under severe pressure 
with pickets bonfires rallies and other interferences 
the pressure to admit women began 11 years ago when former 
princeton university student sally frank sued the allmale ivy club 
as well as the tiger inn 
in july the state supreme court ordered both clubs to admit 
women 
the ivy club admitted 15 women two weeks ago after a membership 
drive 
tiger inn attorney russell h beatie jr says the club cannot be 
forced to obey the court order because it held no membership drive 
this fall beatie said the club intends to hold a spring membership 
drive and will ask the us supreme court to put the state order on 
hold if the high court decides to hear the case 
ms frank now a law professor at drake university in des 
moines iowa said the club is fighting tooth and nail to 
maintain a system of exclusion and discrimination that harms its 
members and the entire princeton community

a television documentary claims british soldiers 
have been training cambodias khmer rouge guerrillas and 
opposition legislators said they will press for a government 
explanation 
the foreign office denied allegations by the documentary 
broadcast tuesday that commandos of the armys elite special air 
service regiment were involved in helping the communist group we 
have never given and will never give aid of any sort to the khmer 
rouge it said in a statement 
the tv programs director says the assistance began in 1985 and 
he claims that britain helped the guerrillas at the request of the 
united states 
george foulkes foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition 
labor party said the film demonstrated that the foreign office 
statement is incorrect the television evidence seemed 
welldocumented 
hundreds of thousands of people died from starvation execution 
and disease during the khmer rouges rule in cambodia from 1975 
until vietnam invaded in late 1978 a civil war involving the 
guerrillas continues today 
the khmer rouge is now the largest and strongest organization in 
a threefaction guerrilla coalition opposed to the 
vietnameseinstalled government of prime minister hun sen the 
other two groups are noncommunist 
the foreign office said in july that britain shared us 
determination to prevent the khmer rouge from taking power 
the hourlong tv program viewpoint 90 cambodia the 
betrayal was made for central television by journalist john 
pilger and shown on the independent television network it alleged 
that special air service men trained khmer rouge guerrillas in 
malaysia and thailand it said britains mi6 espionage agency was 
heavily involved in the covert operation 
the director of the program david monroe said in a radio 
interview with the british broadcasting corp on tuesday 
since 1985 in various forms the british government has 
supplied military training directly to the khmer rouge in guerrilla 
warfare basic mines technology and minelaying techniques 
from 1985 until about november of last year there were serving 
sas officers who were training directly the khmer rouge 
asked in the bbc interview why britain would want to train the 
khmer rouge monroe claimed the united states was trying to get 
others to do the dirty work for them he said britain undertook 
the task to repay us favors during the 1982 falklands war 
he added the idea is to get in place in phnom penh a 
government that is antivietnamese however i dont think anybody 
actually wants to see the khmer rouge take power

opposition groups that would allow the 5 million whites and 30

three codefendants of manuel noriega lost bids to 
be tried separately from the ousted panamanian leader on 
drugtrafficking charges 
us district judge william hoeveler on tuesday denied separate 
trials for luis del cid a former chief aide to noriega william 
saldarriaga an alleged drug trafficker from colombia and brian 
alden davidow an alleged drug dealer in miami 
some defense lawyers have argued that the huge volume of 
testimony against noriega could prejudice jurors against his 
codefendants even if it did not apply to them 
this just happens to be a case where sitting next to noriega 
has an atomic effect and davidow would suffer from the fallout 
said richard sharpstein attorney for davidow the evidence is so 
overwhelming and on such a massive scale that davidow would be 
severely prejudiced by the spillover 
noriega del cid saldarriaga and davidow were among 16 people 
indicted in miami in february 1988 on charges of taking part in a 
conspiracy that made panama a way station and processing center for 
columbias medellin drug cartel the trial is officially scheduled 
to begin jan 28 
i feel sorry for some guy who should have had a twotothree 
week trial and now has a sixtoeight month trial said noriega 
attorney frank rubino who noted the codefendants could also 
experience the lengthy delays expected in preparation of the 
generals defense 
even if the money became available today it would be six to 
nine months before a halfdozen investigators i would have to 
employ could go through the thousands and thousands of records and 
documents in panama that i am told exist he said 
diane cossin a spokeswoman for us attorney dexter lehtinen 
said prosecutors were pleased with the judges ruling against 
separate trials 
the grand jury returned an indictment against all of the 
defendants she said we feel they should be tried together 
drug pilot eduardo pardo another codefendant has already 
pleaded guilty to flying 800000 in cocaine profits from fort 
lauderdale to panama in may 1983 he is awaiting sentencing

authorities in rwanda have arrested more 
than 1500 suspected rebel sympathizers in the nations capital and 
continued their housetohouse searches today sources said 
the sweep began when gunbattles broke out in the capital on 
friday five days after rwandan refugees living in uganda invaded 
their country seeking to overthrow its ruler president juvenal 
habyarimana 
the rebels remained dug in the nations northeastern corner 
said sources in kigali the capital they spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the central african nation of rwanda has aked the united states 
for military supplies and the request is being considered the us 
state department said tuesday 
the sources said kigali was calm today rwandan troops patrolled 
the streets and manned checkpoints and french and belgian troops 
controlled the airport and the road to it from the capital they 
said 
france and belgium have sent nearly 1000 troops to rwanda to 
protect their citizens and embassies france has urged the 
approximately 300 french citizens still in rwanda to leave 
rwandan authorities claim fridays street battles were caused by 
rebel infiltrators and say they have arrested 500 suspected 
sympathizers for questioning 
the rebel group denies any of its members entered kigali and 
says the fighting was between rwandan army loyalists and soldiers 
trying to desert to join the insurgency 
sources said the number detained for questioning appeared to be 
much higher than that cited by the government 
one source quoted witnesses who had seen approximately 1500 
detainees held at a sports stadium outside kigali earlier this 
week 
a western diplomat said the detainees had been moved to jails in 
and around kigali and estimated the number held at about 2000 
the detainees are predominantly tutsi and include businessmen 
intellectuals senior civil servants and clergymen the sources 
said 
most of the rebels are members of the minority tutsi tribe 
which ruled rwanda until the majority hutu gained control in the 
late 1950s in the early 1960s the hutu brutally put down a tutsi 
uprising killing more than 10000 and forcing hundreds of 
thousands to flee to neighboring countries 
the invaders calling themselves the rwandese patriotic front 
are members or offspring of the more than 250000 tutsis who sought 
safe haven in uganda many are ugandan army deserters 
the government monday said its forces continued to battle the 
rebels in the countrys northeast and put the number of the 
invaders at 10000 
the rebels say they want to install a democratic government and 
repatriate all refugees they accuse habyarimanas government of 
corruption human rights abuses and dictatorial leadership and of 
stalling on the refugee issue he has ruled since a coup in 1973 
the government has said the country of 8 million is too crowded 
to accomodate the more than 1 million rwandan refugees in 
neighboring countries and around the world 
rwanda is among the most crowded nations in the world an 
average of more than 566 people live on every square mile compared 
with a nationwide average in the united states of 63 per square 
mile

discovery returned home 
today landing safely on a desert lakebed after a virtually 
flawless mission that sent a sun probe hurtling through space and 
lifted morale at nasa 
rescue teams glad to have you back also to have the fastest 
manmade object in the universe well on its way congratulations on 
a pictureperfect mission mission controls brian duffy told the 
fiveman crew 
discovery touched down at 657 am pdt shortly after sunrise 
precisely as planned the arrival was preceded by the usual two 
sonic booms sweeping the desert 
more than 5200 people cheered and applauded as the shuttle 
landed on a concrete runway on a dry lakebed in the mojave desert 
the touchdown like the rest of the flight was extremely smooth 
discovery circled earth 66 times during the fourday mission 
logging 1707445 miles 
the flight the first shuttle mission in nearly six months 
has helped rebuild nasas image battered in recent months by the 
flawed hubble space telescope and hydrogen leaks on the two other 
shuttles 
this flight is probably as close to perfect as we can get 
flight director ron dittemore said tuesday the sixmonth delay was 
the longest gap between missions since shuttle flights resumed 
after the 1986 challenger accident 
discovery blasted into orbit just a few minutes behind schedule 
saturday several hours later the five astronauts deployed the 
ulysses solar probe exactly as planned 
ulysses continued to race through space on a 186 billionmile 
fiveyear journey it will travel to jupiter to use the planets 
gravity to sling it back across the solar system and into an 
unprecedented orbit around the suns poles 
the 250 million spacecraft is expected to pass over the suns 
poles in 1994 and 1995 
on tuesday the astronauts retracted the shuttles 50foot robot 
arm which had been extended in an experiment to measure the 
deteriorating effects of space on an intelsat satellite that is 
stuck in a useless low orbit material attached to the arm was 
identical to that used on the satellites solar panels 
intelsat an organization of countries that owns the 
communications satellite will study the amount of decay and decide 
whether it is worth sending astronauts on a rescue mission in 1992 
discoverys other crew members are mission specialists bill 
shepherd and bruce melnick 
atlantis is due to fly next on a secret military mission in 
early november the mission originally was scheduled for july but 
was delayed by hydrogen leaks 
some repairs still must be completed in atlantis engine 
compartment which was damaged by a metal beam left there by 
workers the 9foot beam left about 25 dents and dings when it 
rattled around while the shuttle was hoisted upright

when nicaraguas new government yanked 
subsidies for public services utility bills took off and diplomats 
hit the roof 
but instead of refusing to pay as many nicaraguans are doing 
the foreign officials organized a protest and their bills were put 
on hold pending an investigation 
we pay the light and water bills when they are normal but 
not when they are exaggerated said soviet embassy press attache 
vyacheslav spassky 
a diplomatic source said the soviets were stunned by an electric 
bill in july for 4000 under the sandinistas who were voted out 
of office in february monthly utility bills rarely exceeded a few 
hundred dollars 
president violeta chamorros economic restructuring program 
passed the full cost of electric water and sewer and telephone 
services to consumers 
central bank president francisco mayorga recently said the 
government reduced its monthly deficit from 28 million in april 
when mrs chamorro took over to 7 million in september 
nicaraguans however have not quickly adapted to the new prices 
after a decade of sandinista subsidies 
the first effects of the austerity program surfaced in july with 
food gas and utility price increases that jolted people in a 
country where wages of less than 100 a month are common 
a government official who asked that her name not be used said 
her mother received an 800 water bill based on the official 
exchange rate 
the black market rate once well above the official rate is now 
only slightly better than at the banks 
this goes beyond ridiculous it is just incredible its 
astounding its its the exasperated official said 
with electricity a typical family bill that was 8 a month is 
now around 117 
the diplomatic protest began last month at a dinner when 
somebody complained about soaring utility bills said us embassy 
spokesman stedman howard 
soon all the 42 accredited foreign missions in managua 
confronted the foreign ministry which appointed a committee to 
look into the complaints and told the embassies to hold off paying 
bills until meters and consumption were checked 
technicians found broken water pipes at the north korean embassy 
that explained high water bills there said ministry spokesman 
david silva 
but the libyans would not let technicians in to check out the 
water meters and cuban officials complained that meter readers 
never got close enough to take a reading 
although howard declined to say how much the us embassy was 
being billed he said his home electric bill went from 200 to 780 
in one month 
thats indicative of the general trend howard said

the communist party has decided to stay out of the 
debate over how the country should move to a market economy and it 
plans to cut its headquarters staff nearly in half officials said 
today 
after a twoday meeting of the partys policy making central 
committee deputy general secretary vladimir ivashko told a news 
conference the soviet legislature should decide the nations 
economic future 
it would be wrong if the plenary session of the communist 
party central committee turned into an affiliate of the supreme 
soviet and started competing on various aspects of a particular 
program he said 
the legislature is considering conflicting plans for the 
transition from a centrally planned economy to a market one 
the central committees restraint is in line with president 
mikhail s gorbachevs attempts to specify more clearly the powers 
of the party and state and to give the legislature independence 
but its failure to endorse an economic plan could be seen by many 
soviets as indecision 
the committee traditionally has made proposals to the 
legislature which then dutifully enacted them 
but the current legislature the supreme soviet was 
democratically elected in part and is more wary of party proposals 
while not committing the party to an economic plan ivashko did 
differ with proposals to privatize industry he said a nationwide 
referendum should be held on the question 
gorbachev referred to the difficulties of plotting economic 
reform in a meeting today with executives of the new york stock 
exchange 
these days we are deciding the question of how we should move 
forward everybody is facing a lot of questions we do and people 
have even more gorbachev the party chief told the american 
visitors 
in a move that coincides wih declining party membership the 
central committee will cut its headquarters staff by 404 percent 
ivashko announced 
he said later in an interview that 580 employees will be laid 
off leaving about 800 more than 500 were dismissed last year the 
communist party has about 18 million members 
in a partial concession to demonstrators that have been 
demanding the party give up property it nationalized ivashko said 
buildings with historical and cultural significance and small 
churches now in the partys hands will be made into monuments he 
said the party would not ask for compensation and would turn over 
the buildings gradually 
the party has valued its property at 49 billion rubles or 82 
billion at the official rate

three supreme court justices voiced doubts 
today about the wisdom or legality of an employers fetal 
protection policy that excludes all women of childbearing age 
from some hazardous jobs 
in a case that could affect millions of working women justices 
john paul stevens antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor posed 
questions seemingly critical of the policy during an hourlong 
argument session 
stevens questioned stanley jaspan a lawyer for the 
milwaukeebased johnson controls inc about the risks to women 
working in its batterymaking factories 
is the slightest risk enough to justify banning women from 
some jobs stevens asked 
oconnor and scalia took issue with jaspans interpretation of 
what burdens congress placed on employers when it passed the 
pregnancy discrimination act in 1978 
scalia told jaspan his suggestion that the 1978 law means 
employers cannot discriminate against women based on pregnancy 
except to protect a fetus is to make a farce of the pregnancy 
discrimination act youre making it a ridiculous piece of 
legislation 
since 1982 johnson controls the nations largest auto battery 
manufacturer has barred women from factory jobs that expose them 
to unsafe levels of lead the principal material used in making 
batteries 
the policy was upheld by lower courts 
lead exposure is a health risk for female workers and their 
fetuses 
lead exposure of course also is a health risk for male 
workers but the scientific proof that high levels of lead in a 
mans blood can contribute to fetal harm is sketchy 
it would violate common sense to require an employer to 
damage unborn children jaspan argued he said lead exposure 
poisons the fetus and causes permanent brain damage 
but san francisco lawyer marsha berzon representing those who 
challenged the johnson controls policy said the net effect of a 
policy like this is to sanction the resegregation of the 
workplace 
she said such policies relegate women to stereotypical jobs such 
as teaching child care and nursing 
the justices must decide by july whether the fetal protection 
policy amounts to illegal discrimination 
one federal appeals court judge calling the case the most 
important of its kind since congress outlawed onthejob sex bias 
26 years ago said the estimated number of women affected runs as 
high as 20 million 
at johnson controls women who could not prove they were 
infertile were forced to transfer to other jobs although their 
salaries were not cut some of the women were in their 60s 
fertile women now hired are ineligible for toppaying jobs at 
the companys 13 plants located in california delaware florida 
illinois kentucky north carolina michigan missouri ohio 
oregon texas vermont and wisconsin 
eight employees and the united auto workers union challenged the 
policy in court alleging that it violates title vii of the civil 
rights act of 1964 
it was not the first such challenge at least 15 major 
corporations have fetal protection policies and the american civil 
liberties union says lawsuits have been filed in behalf of hospital 
technicians and factory and auto workers 
among the companies with such policies are general motors 
monsanto and dupont 
us district judge robert w warren in milwaukee ruled for 
johnson controls before any trial was held and the 7th us 
circuit court of appeals voted 74 to uphold his ruing 
judge john l coffey wrote for the appeals court that the 
differing treatment of women employees was based on a business 
necessity the appeals court concluded that the policy is 
reasonably necessary to industrial safety 
bush administration lawyers told the high court that a fetal 
protection policy could be legal but that it should be judged by a 
standard more stringent than the business necessity test used 
by the appeals court 
in a strongly worded dissent to the appeals court ruling judge 
frank easterbrook called the case the most important title vii case 
ever and said such policies could consign more women to womens 
work while reserving betterpaying but more hazardous jobs for 
men 
he noted that lead is only one of many workplace substances that 
could harm fetuses and said as many as 20 million jobs could be 
closed to women if the 7th circuit courts rationale were adopted 
nationwide 
in action tuesday the supreme court 
let stand a ruling in a pennsylvania case that public schools 
that allow civic groups and others to rent space cannot refuse the 
same access to religious organizations 
agreed to decide in a florida case whether police without a 
court warrant may conduct random searches aboard buses and trains 
left intact an affirmative action program plan for hiring and 
promoting more minorities and women in san franciscos fire 
department the plan had been challenged as discriminatory against 
white men 
revived a 4 billion lawsuit by a millionaire florida inventor 
who says an abc television program falsely portrayed him as a liar 
and hypocrite

founded in 1980 by jakob von uexkull a swedishgerman writer who 
sold his stamp collection to provide the funding

western universities rather than grassroots innovators

9 the day before the nobel prize ceremonies 
alice tepper marlin founder and president of the council on 
economic priorities in new york won one award

responsibility 
it publishes monthly newsletters studies and books including 
the 1988 bestseller shopping for a better world a guide that

120000 to help them continue their work 
they included human rights lawyer felicia langer 59 who since 
1968 has defended palestinians in military courts in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip the jury cited her 
exemplary courage for basic human rights under very difficult 
circumstances

university of bremen 
bernard ledea ouedraogo of burkina faso was honored for 
establishing the grassroots organizations naam and the six s

trade watchers in the agriculture department 
are straining to see what other countries are doing that could 
affect the prices american farmers get for wheat corn and other 
commodities 
in other words competition is the name of the game and 
practically every foreign grain exporter is swinging away 
for example a report by the departments foreign agricultural 
service included an article about the canadian wheat board and its 
guaranteed price to farmers in todays competitive world market 
with the recent precipitous decline in world wheat prices 
attention is drawn to the role of export monopolies such as the 
canadian wheat board and the extent to which guaranteed price 
levels to producers may have been overestimated possibly requiring 
government treasuries to cover resulting losses the report said 
in many international markets canadian wheat must compete with 
prices established by subsidized wheat from the european community 
meanwhile the boards initial payment to wheat farmers for no 
1 canadian western red spring wheat of 135 percent protein was 
about 117 per metric ton in us dollars 
but canadian wheat on the world market is worth only about 69 
per ton therefore the report said the deficit of 48 per ton 
presumably would have to be absorbed by the board 
any losses being sustained by the canadian wheat board on 
wheat exports could be offset by profits from sales executed before 
the recent price declines or by sales to commercial customers who 
pay premium prices for highprotein wheat the report said 
some other comments about the current grain situation 
brazil will need to import more wheat in 199091 because of 
reduced domestic plantings a crop shortfall and growing 
consumption although brazil has a supply agreement with argentina 
it may have to turn to other suppliers 
canada whose wheat trade agreement with brazil ended in 1988 
has been exporting wheat under an informal agreement the report 
said trade sources indicate that canada has expressed an 
interest in negotiation a new formal agreement but has insisted 
that arrearage on past credit sales be paid first 
south korea has been buying competitively priced feedquality 
wheat from the european community the lowquality wheat from 
europe already is displacing corn in the south korea and could hurt 
us exports of feed grain to that growing asian market 
polands wheat imports in 199091 are expected to drop to the 
lowest level in more than 20 years mostly because of a record 1990 
harvest diminished consumer subsidies and reduced livestock 
feeding 
typically the ec has been the major supplier of wheat to 
poland the report said however lower import needs in poland 
could free additional ec supplies for shipments to other markets 
and could increase competition for the united states 
in southern east europe greater demand for imports of coarse 
grain has been spurred by harvest shortfalls in yugoslavia and 
hungary major cornproducing countries 
 
washington ap consumer prices for bananas peaked in july 
because of a strike against chiquita brands inc by workers in 
honduras according to an agriculture department report 
the united states imported 292 million metric tons of bananas 
in 1989 a metric ton is about 2205 pounds 
in late june a strike against chiquita brands significantly 
disrupted shipments of honduran bananas in july and august and 
resulted in unseasonably high retail prices in us markets 
the departments economic research service said 
total imports of bananas were up during the first six months of 
this year including the period of the honduran strike as imports 
from ecuador the largest supplier rose 36 percent from a year 
earlier 
between july 1 and aug 18 according to usda trade figures 
shipments of honduran bananas to the united states dropped 54 
percent from a year earlier to only 27034 tons 
the strike curtailed honduran exports of about 108000 metric 
tons over its sevenweek duration the report said the united 
states accounts for more than 60 percent of the countrys total 
banana exports and chiquita is the largest handler 
meanwhile us banana prices which usually soften with stiffer 
competition from summer fruits rose sharply in july as a result of 
the reduced supply from honduras the report said 
although the impact was primarily on the east coast where the 
bulk of honduran banana imports are sold west coast retail prices 
also reflected the market shortage the report said 
in july the us retail banana prices reported by the labor 
department averaged 529 cents per pound up 18 percent from june 
but with the end of the strike and more bananas in the market 
prices dropped sharply in august averaging 463 cents per pound 
nationally a 13 percent drop from july 
 
washington ap trout farming is sharing in an expanded demand 
for fish and other seafood an annual report by the agriculture 
department shows 
growers in 15 major troutproducing states had total sales of 
fish and eggs of about 769 million during the year that ended 
aug 31 according to the report that was up 7 percent from 717 
million in 198889 
the sales included 599 million pounds of trout valued at 726 
million and 349 million trout eggs worth 431 million 
an estimated 95 percent of the trout sold were foodsize the 
report said the average value was 114 per pound up from 108 
the previous year 
idaho was the leader in sales at about 331 million other 
leading producers included california 111 million pennsylvania

enrollment tripled at the orton 
school this fall but there is no risk of overcrowding three 
students now share the schools single classroom 
now i have someone to play with at recess said levi tibbs 
a fifthgrader who was the schools lone student last year 
his playmates are sisters emily hansen a second grader and 
sheri davis who is in sixth grade their attendance at the 1918 
schoolhouse has helped stave off its extinction 
we considered closing it but if we did then wed have to pay 
to board those kids in town or wed have to pay mileage for them to 
be driven to school and home every day said county school 
superintendent jerry kleinsasser 
and that trip is no quick jaunt the nearest town is fort 
pierre a long hours drive down 50 miles of bumpy winding road 
that follows the rugged breaks of the missouri river 
locals call the area starkly beautiful outsiders call it 
desolate winters are harsh and snowy on the dakota prairie and 
the wind almost never stills 
you can hear the coyotes fighting and jabbering all night 
long said teacher steve pickner 31 who lives with his dog in a 
rentfree mobile home on the school site his nearest neighbors are 
antelope grouse and rattlesnakes 
pickner is in his first year as a teacher he graduated from 
the university of south dakota in august and he has his qualms 
id rather teach 50 kids in one class than three in different 
grades he said thats 21 separate lessons i have to prepare 
each night but it does keep me busy and helps pass the time out 
here 
its hard to get used to the quiet after classes i look 
forward to tuesdays thursdays and saturdays when the mail comes 
pickner said 
occasionally he helps mend fences at a nearby ranch that raises 
one of the nations largest private buffalo herds 
elementary principal elsie baye says teachers rarely stay more 
than a year at orton its isolated she admits and the free 
housing is essential to lure teachers to such a rustic outpost 
still she persists in putting the best face on it someone 
who is an artist or wildlife photographer would just love it 
there 
and as for the children its a great educational opportunity 
our rural kids are usually good students they get a lot of 
oneonone 
levi tibbs mother loretta taught at the orton school her 
husband wayne and their three other children all went there 
they were almost a year ahead of other students when they got to 
ninth grade she said 
in ortons classroom big and bright with three desks in the 
middle two students sit together while pickner tutors the third 
across the room 
an outdated computer sits in one corner a television set that 
gets only one channel sits in another the other classroom fixtures 
include an aging piano an ant farm a water fountain and a 
microwave oven where the kids and teacher heat their lunches 
once a month a janitor shows up to shine the linoleum floor 
three times a day the huge bell atop the freshly painted white 
building tolls 
the bell did not toll this year for the orton school but its 
future is not assured stanley county rural schools once were full 
but fewer ranch families live in the area mrs tibbs said 
they couldnt all make a living here anymore because milking 
cows and a few acres of land just didnt cut it people sold out to 
others and the remaining ranches got bigger that cut down on 
families and kids in the area she said 
but orton is not alone in its tininess of the three other rural 
schools in stanley county none has more than eight students 
almost onefourth of the elementary schools in south dakota 
still have only one or two teachers legally schools cannot be 
closed unless enrollment slips to fewer than five and neither the 
kids nor their parents seem inclined abandon the small schools 
its funner than a big school said sheri davis

after decades behind the iron curtain 
hundreds of etruscan artifacts have returned to italy in a major 
show from museums in eastern europe and the soviet union 
the 1200 artifacts which were nearly inaccessible to 
westerners for decades have come home to central italy where the 
etruscan culture flourished until the 1st century bc 
the exhibit is being hailed as a chance for scholars and the 
public to rediscover etruscan masterpieces hidden away for decades 
it also is seen as a sign of exciting times to come in the art 
world as the new democracies of eastern europe begin to exchange 
exhibits with countries that were ideological foes 
this brings together an extraordinary number of masterpieces 
that were very little known said massimo pallottino president 
of the national institute of italian etruscan studies 
its something of exceptional importance 
the exhibit in a gothic castle in viterbo 50 miles north of 
rome was organized by the state museums of berlin 
it includes etruscan artifacts from 26 museums in poland 
hungary czechoslovakia and the former east germany as well as the 
soviet union 
the etruscans were a powerful empire that dominated italy before 
succumbing to the roman empire they were known for commercial 
flair an elaborate religion and a brilliant artisan tradition 
which included the finest goldwork in ancient europe 
the viterbo show brings together a wide range of etruscan 
artifacts ranging from a simple ceramic urn shaped like a house 
dating from the 9th century bc to elaborately carved sarcophagi 
from the 2nd and 3rd centuries bc 
the highlights include the contents of an 8th century bc tomb 
of a man known as the warrior of tarquinia among the 104 pieces 
are engraved bronze shields weapons bracelets rings and even a 
razor for the afterlife 
another rare item is the tile of capua a 5thcentury bc 
plaque with writing believed to be part of a funeral ritual it is 
the secondlongest existing piece of etruscan writing which 
scientists have never succeeded in translating 
several carved stone and alabaster sarcophagi with scenes of 
battles or the trip to the afterlife illustrate the etruscans 
talent for sculpture on top of a few lies a likeness of the dead 
person often propped up on one elbow as if to enjoy a good 
etruscan meal 
also in the exhibit is gold jewelry including tiny earrings 
etched to resemble shields or bunches of grapes from the 3rd to 5th 
centuries bc 
many etruscan treasures wound up in german and russian hands in 
the 19th century before italy passed a law limiting exports 
germans in particular did much of the early research on the 
etruscans and were interested in acquiring the pieces 
many of the items in the exhibit were difficult for westerners 
to see during communist rule in eastern europe due to the 
difficulty of obtaining tourist visas 
even some of our experts hadnt seen them said carlo maria 
cardoni director of the exhibit 
for the italian organizers the novelty of having treasures from 
eastern european museums was matched by the novelty of working with 
museum officials trained under communism 
their architect still goes around with a wooden ruler and a 
pencil said cardoni shaking his head let him see a computer 
that in 35 minutes lays out the show and its like hitting him in 
the head with a hammer 
the germans were also uneasy about the idea of making a 
videocassette of the exhibit cardoni said i just went ahead 
with it anyway he shrugged 
the show which closes sunday has toured eastern europe and the 
soviet union and may eventually go to france or japan cardoni 
said 
art experts say the show is an example of the revolution that is 
occurring in cultural exchanges now that communist governments have 
fallen or become more moderate 
as curators and scholars theres always been an international 
interest in sharing the cultural wealth of one nation with 
another said jillian slonim public information director of the 
new yorkbased american federation of arts 
on the practical level the circumstances have radically 
changed in the last short while along with the changes in the 
governments

members of a leftist band that advocates 
the rights of the underpriviliged doused a moving train car with 
gasoline and set it on fire killing 47 people news reports said 
today 
a survivor said he and other terrified passengers stampeded for 
the trains exits as the fire swept through the car tuesday night 
fourteen people were injured in the blaze according to the news 
reports 
the blaze came just hours after six highercaste students killed 
themselves by poisoning hanging or immolation to protest an 
affirmative action for the lower casts announced by prime minister 
vp singh trust of india reported 
radicals were calling for a strike today in support of the plan 
which reserves half of the governments vacancies for lowcaste 
hindus 
the train torching was the worst incident linked to singhs aug 
7 announcement of the policy the deaths tuesday pushed to more 
than 150 the number of people killed in related violence 
united news of india said 47 people were burned to death when 
the passenger train car was set ablaze near hyderabad 590 miles 
south of new delhi 
the news agency initially reported that 60 people were killed 
it quoted official sources as saying 45 bodies had been 
recovered and more were trapped in the charred rail car it was not 
immediately known how many passengers were aboard when the blaze 
began 
united news and newspapers quoted local officials and witnesses 
as saying the fire was set by members of the peoples war group 
the group is part of the socalled naxalite movement which often 
resorts to kidnappings and violence to press its claim as an 
advocate of the rights of oppressed peoples 
the hindu a daily newspaper based in the southern city of 
madras said 10 to 15 members of the peoples war group boarded the 
train at cherlapalli and handed out pamphlets protesting a supreme 
court injunction suspending implementation of the plan on which 
singhs job proposal is based 
the activists then poured gasoline on the floor of a passenger 
car ignited it and jumped off the train the hindu said its 
report was attributed to a correspondent who visited the site while 
the car was still burning 
the indian express another national newspaper quoted railroad 
officials as giving a similar account and saying one or two 
naxalites might have died in the fire 
the naxalite movement was founded in 1967 drawing inspiration 
from the late chinese leader mao tsetung and advocating armed 
overthrow of government the name naxalite stems from naxalbari 
village in west bengal state where the movement started it later 
spread across eastern and southern india 
the times of india another national newspaper quoted witnesses 
as saying the arsonists sang revolutionary songs before jumping off 
the 15car passenger train which was traveling from hyderabad to 
warangal 
warangal 80 miles northeast of hyderabad is at the core of a 
rural region where naxalite agitation is often reported 
i was sitting in the middle of the compartment the times 
quoted passenger samba murthy as saying i heard slogans and 
suddenly there was smoke all around and lights went off about 20 
of us could jump off there was a stampede 
murthy a contractor from warangal added i do not know what 
happened to my brother and brotherinlaw who were traveling with 
me 
the times quoted another passenger identified only as narsimha 
as saying the arsonists shouted slogans in support of the strike 
called for today by the naxalites 
singh wants to reserve an additional 27 percent of federal jobs 
for lowcaste hindus twentytwo percent already are reserved for 
tribespeople and outcasts or untouchables who are at the very 
bottom of indian society 
this means fewer uppercaste people would get jobs even if 
their academic qualifications are higher than people from the lower 
social classes 
strikes marches and rallies have swelled in new delhi and 
several states across india as the students pressed their protests 
by torching buses and stoning government buildings police and 
paramilitary forces have retaliated with tear gas and bullets

buoyed by a nearly flawless flight 
of its fleet leader nasa headed with renewed confidence toward the 
next shuttle sendoff next months launch of atlantis 
the fact that it flew and they had such a textbook mission 
really makes us feel good conrad nagel a nasa official in 
charge of atlantis prelaunch operations said of the discovery 
mission 
atlantis secret military mission will be the fifth and final 
shuttle flight for 1990 four fewer than planned unless 
columbias hydrogen leaks can be repaired in time for a late 
november or december launch 
safety rather than flight qutas will dictate when columbia goes 
up said launch director bob sieck 
the bottom line is weve got to have safe and successful 
missions and thats always been our goal sieck said 
the way to restore nasas credibility sieck said is to set 
realistic launch dates given our capabilities and meet the 
objectives as close as we can 
the national aeronautics and space administration met both those 
criteria preparing for discoverys fourday mission which ended 
wednesday with a smooth landing at edwards air force base calif 
discoverys liftoff saturday was just a day later than planned and 
was followed by the release of its cargo the ulysses sun probe 
it was discoverys 11th flight a shuttle record and ended the 
secondlongest grounding of the fleet caused by dangerous hydrogen 
leaks discovery had flown the last mission before that in april 
columbia the oldest spaceship has logged nine trips atlantis 
six challengers last journey which ended in disaster in january 
1986 was its 10th 
atlantis like columbia has had more than its share of trouble 
this year 
a tanking test on atlantis in june uncovered hydrogen leaks in 
plumbing between the orbiter and external tank and its july 
pentagon flight was put on hold similar leaks had been found in 
columbia in may 
nasa replaced atlantis external tank and attached plumbing as 
well as seals in liquid hydrogen valves on the orbiter side of the 
vehicle 
the repairs were completed sept 28 five days later a metal 
beam from a work platform banged around the engine compartment as 
the orbiter was being hoisted into an upright position 
workers forgot to remove the 9footlong bright yellow beam 
nagel said the space agency is extremely fortunate the beam 
did not cause more damage about 25 dings and dents were reported 
the worst being a cracked purge duct and a smashed 1inch section 
of an overboard vent line for liquid oxygen 
nasa planned to move atlantis from the assembly building to the 
launch pad this week a tanking test to check for hydrogen leaks is 
planned for later this month 
we feel like were going to come through the tanking test with 
flying colors nagel said 
columbia which has endured four failed countdowns since may 
was moved from the pad back to the assembly building tuesday 
because of potentially severe weather it will be transported early 
next week to the other launch pad where it too will undergo a 
tanking test this month 
a ninemember investigative team is working seven days a week on 
columbias leak problem which appears to be confined to the engine 
compartment each investigator received a oneway ticket to florida 
and was told he cannot go home until all the leaks are found 
were going to finally capture this diabolical leak in 
columbia and were going to get it back in the air hopefully 
before the end of the year sieck said 
sieck doesnt expect this to be the last time a shuttle is 
grounded by a mysterious problem that crops up during the 
countdown 
we hope theyre minimum but i wouldnt say there never will 
be one again he said

war jitters from the middle east helped push 
crude oil to more than 41 a barrel during one spurt of feverish 
buying today its highest level since the 1979 iranian revolution 
thats nearly double the price before iraqs invasion of kuwait 
on aug 2 
in early trading today light sweet crude the us benchmark 
grade was as high as 4115 per barrel on the new york mercantile 
exchange the highest price ever for an oil futures contract 
before falling back to 4088 that was 48 cents above tuesdays 
record close of 4040 for november delivery 
crude oil futures contracts which promise delivery at a certain 
date at a set price have traded on the new york mercantile 
exchange since 1983 
crude oil last fetched more than 40 a barrel after the 1979 
iranian revolution but crude would have to hit about 57 in 1990 
dollars to equal the real cost of oil from a decade ago experts 
have said 
traders said the slayings of 19 palestinians in a clash with 
police in jerusalem on monday saddams threat of retaliation and 
the approach of winter in the united states which increases 
demand for oil pushed the price up 
everybodys worst possible nightmare is fighting breaking out 
in the middle east and another cold winter in the united states 
said peter beutel an oil analyst at pegasus econometric group inc 
in hoboken nj 
saddam appeared to use the slayings in jerusalem to lash out at 
israel and the united states in a statement he said iraq has a 
new longrange missile that could be launched against israel and 
the usled forces in saudi arabia 
the benchmark us grade was 2210 a barrel the day before the 
iraqi invasion the main reason for the increase has been the 
possibility that war will disrupt production making oil more 
scarce and more expensive 
while futures prices do not directly affect the price of 
gasoline at the pump selfserve unleaded gasoline nationwide rose 
24 cents in the last week to 137 per gallon the american 
automobile association said tuesday 
the aaa said unleaded gasoline has risen 295 cents since aug

the israeli government today named a threeman 
panel led by a former chief of the mossad secret service to 
investigate the killing of 19 palestinian rioters on the temple 
mount 
the investigation was ordered by prime minister yitzhak shamir 
before the un security council was to begin debate on condemning 
israel for using police force against rioters the security council 
also was expected to order a un inquiry into mondays bloodbath 
it will now be investigated by ourselves we dont need a 
probe by international factors said yossi ahimeir shamirs 
spokesman the marginal point of whether it was excessive force 
or not is to be investigated 
israeli security forces killed 19 arabs and wounded 140 in 
mondays clash outside the alaqsa mosque islams thirdholiest 
site it was the bloodiest confrontation of the 34monthold 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation and it raised an 
immediate world outcry 
the panel was ordered to investigate events leading to the riot 
and the conduct of paramilitary border police in opening fire with 
live ammunition 
asked what powers the committee would have ahimeir said it 
could make every recommendation they see fit and the prime 
minister will decide what to do with it 
however israel radio reported that it will not have the power 
to subpoena reluctant witnesses and its recommendations will not be 
binding 
ahimeir said the investigation would be headed by reserve maj 
gen zvi zamir who was head of the mossad from 1968 to 1974 the 
other members will be yaacov neeman a prominent attorney and 
chaim kubersky a former director of the interior ministry 
ahimeir said the committee would report as soon as possible 
when asked whether its hearings would be public he replied that 
they involve security and operational details so if necessary 
discussions will be subject to the usual security laws 
the last time such a panel was appointed was in 1985 to examine 
the deaths of two palestinian bus hijackers while in custody of the 
shin bet security service 
members of the un security council on tuesday debated a 
resolution condemning the shootings and calling for a un 
investigation the united states was prepared to cast a rare vote 
against its ally 
president bush criticized israeli forces for not acting with 
more restraint 
today china zimbabwe and kuwaits governmentinexile added 
their voices to those condemning israel for the violence 
in the occupied territories soldiers kept more than a million 
palestinians under curfew for a third day to contain unrest 
triggered by the violence at the old city site which is holy to 
both jews and moslems 
in a leaflet issued tuesday the plobacked leaders of the 
palestinian uprising urged revenge attacks on soldiers and jewish 
settlers 
the government published a fullpage ad in leading dailies 
urging israelis to respond to mondays riots by showing up at the 
wailing wall for simchat torah holiday celebrations thursday night 
the holiday which means joy of torah marks the end of the 
eightday sukkot or feast of tabernacles 
police chief yaacov turner denied reports in israeli newspapers 
that suggested his troops had failed to heed intelligence 
information to expect mondays riot and to deploy accordingly 
the riot began when palestinians hurled rocks at jewish 
worshippers at the western wall judaisms holiest site and just 
below the alaqsa mosque twentyeight jews were injured by rocks 
police then charged at the rioters on the temple mount 
initially firing tear gas according to israeli officials the 
troops heavily outnumbered only later opened fire with live 
ammunition 
the attack was provoked by rumors that jewish zealots planned to 
march on the temple mount which both moslems and jews consider 
sacred and reclaim it for judaism palestinians said the site of 
the violence is the most emotionally charged in the lands israel 
captured in the 1967 middle east war 
the leftofcenter labor party published a statement accusing 
the government of a lax in security that endangered the lives of 
jews at the wailing wall the western wall is also known as the 
wailing wall 
the conservative daily maariv in a fullpage story today said 
some policemen apparently panicked over rumors that colleagues were 
trapped in a burning police station on the mount during the riot 
the opening of fire was not done in planned fashion or by 
command but rather independently based on decisions by isolated 
policemen or a small force when they felt their lives were 
endangered the newspaper said

raleigh nc ap president bush treading carefully on the 
tax issue as he campaigned for conservative sen jesse helms 
promised today to work to put together a better package to 
match the 500 billion in deficit cuts of his rejected plan 
it was bushs first test of his professed goodwill toward 
republicans who disagree with him on the budget 
helms opposed the package bush crafted with congressional 
leaders and which was rejected last week by the house calling it 
a turkey he also has criticized bushs decision to abandon his 
no new taxes campaign pledge 
of course there are going to be differences bush told the 
fundraising breakfast in raleighs civic center 
bush steered completely clear of the issue of higher taxes and 
didnt mention them when he ticked off a list of features that the 
new budget pact should include 
the campaign appearances came a day after bush hinted he might 
agree to higher taxes on wealthy americans in exchange to lower 
capital gains tax rates then abruptly withdrew the offer under 
pressure from republican senators 
helms is seeking a fourth term in a heated race against harvey 
gantt the liberal black former mayor of charlotte polls show the 
two locked in a dead heat 
helms avoided areas of disagreement with the president 
completely calling bush evenhanded in all matters 
hes evenhanded hes always the same a thoroughbred 
gentleman who is recognized around this world who is recognized as 
a courageous and brave leader 
later in st petersburg fla bush told a fundraising rally 
for republican gov bob martinez that democratic control of both 
houses of congress is all the more reason for republicans to 
stand for the best possible budget 
bush also defended his decision to shut down the government over 
the columbus day weekend rather than approve the first version of a 
temporary spending bill i did it to keep the pressure on he 
said in prepared remarks 
the president was to wind up his threestate swing through the 
south tonight at a gop reception in atlanta for georgia 
gubernatorial candidate johnny isakson 
at his raleigh stop bush said my objective now is to put 
together a better package one that meets our target of 500 
billion deficit reduction over the next five years 
i cant confine my support to somebody who agrees with me on a 
deficit deal today or some bill tomorrow bush said tuesday when 
asked whether he would have trouble campaigning for helms 
in todays remarks bush made no mention of the divisive issue 
of higher taxes for wealthy americans the president on tuesday did 
a flipflop on the issue first suggesting at a morning news 
conference that he was open to a compromise that would trade higher 
tax rates for affluent americans for a cut in the capitalgains 
tax 
then later in the day republican leaders said bush had 
reversed his position on the issue 
the budget package rejected by the house which called for 
higher taxes on gasoline cigarettes and alcohol and cuts in 
medicare and farm programs was not the one i would have written 
alone bush said 
and its not one jesse would have written either but as 
president i dont control the congress and so we had to compromise 
because the future of the country is at stake 
he said he worked for the bipartisan agreement because it was 
the best plan possible and said bush i will continue now 
to press hard for a budget that fulfills the spirit of that 
bipartisan plan and proves to the american people once and for all 
that we can deal with this deficit 
like many conservative republicans helms was a critic of the 
500 billion fiveyear package of new taxes and spending cuts 
crafted by bush and congressional leaders but rejected last week in 
the house 
among its many features the plan would have raised taxes on 
cigarettes extremely unpopular in tobacco states like north 
carolina 
helms even voted against a vague budget outline approved late 
monday in the senate with bushs endorsement an outline that 
didnt specify what would be taxed 
still it was bushs second campaign appearance for helms he 
also helped him raise money for his campaign in june 
i would be talking about the common themes bush said 
were talking about the broad principles that unite us

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the 
united states and abroad 
 
oct 8 
san antonio light on the federal budget 
what a way to run a government 
millions of americans who have to handle family and business 
budgets undoubtedly have been shaking their heads and uttering that 
comment 
tourists who have planned vacations for months and traveled 
thousands of miles only to find the national parks or government 
museums padlocked shut undoubtedly have been saying worse 
government employees who literally dont know from day to day 
whether to report for work can hardly be expected to bring high 
morale to the work place 
few can sympathize with a congress that has known for months 
that such tough decisions loomed with an election one month away 
members of congress now stand truly accountable before voters and 
those voters are not in a tolerant mood 
this form of government eventually could be at stake if such 
antics persists 
 
oct 8 
courierpost hannibal mo on the federal budget 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo summed up the 
crisis situation at the end of the house debate on the revised 
budget with all my heart i believe the country is at stake 
these deficits cannot go on 
we believe that gephardt is right on target with this budget 
message 
our countrys economic future is at stake it is time to stop 
catering to the needs of specialinterest groups and concentrate 
instead on the good of the nation 
we believe lawmakers must commit themselves to reducing the 
federal deficit additional taxes may be needed to accomplish this 
goal but more importantly spending must be reduced 
this country is in financial peril and we cannot continue to be 
the saviors of the world 
voters must put pressure on lawmakers to act in the best 
interests of america as a whole 
perhaps this electioneve financial crisis is what it will take 
to get lawmakers to concentrate on reducing the deficit and 
building an economically stable world for the next generation 
 
oct 3 
argus observer ontario ore on politicians 
politicians should have gotten the message by now election 
years for some time now have shown decreasing numbers of the 
electorate turning out to vote 
from the complaints we hear it isnt that the voters are 
satisfied with the status quo more and more we begin to think that 
the voter is discouraged with those whom we send to washington 
the political bickering is hardly something to instill faith in 
the system neither of the major parties has really drafted policy 
which will cut into the horrendous deficit a few bright 
legislators can see the handwriting on the wall and realize that 
this deficit must be curbed but they are too few 
others go blissfully on voting large raises for themselves and 
constituents handing out dollars for pet projects where their 
greatest poitical support is and not enacting any really 
meaningful reform for both social and economic issues 
the inability of these elected solons to stand up to the issues 
is appalling right now it is hard to determine just what they 
are doing to earn salaries four or five or more times what most 
of us earn not to mention the perks which few if any taxpayers 
can claim

the providence ri journalbulletin on nuclear plants and 
cancer 
the national cancer institute examined all deaths from 16 types 
of cancer occurring from 1950 to 1984 in 107 counties that are in 
close proximity to 62 commercial and defenserelated nuclear 
facilities across the country according to john boice chief of 
the institutes radiation epidemiology branch the study indicates 
there is no evidence of increased risk of cancer among people 
living near nuclear power plants 
these results confirm what most scientific and medical 
specialists in the field of nuclear radiation have been saying all 
along while acknowledging that nuclear plants release some 
radiation into the atmosphere during operation they have pointed 
out that the amounts are extremely small less than 5 percent of 
the background radiation that people are habitually exposed to from 
the natural environment 
the national cancer institute is not famous for its pronuclear 
bias and no proponent of nuclear energy within the government or 
without can ever underestimate the primary importance of the 
strictest safety standards so americans may take some heart from 
this report especially since it comes on the heels of the massive 
columbia universityaudubon society study that found no evidence of 
increased cancer rates attributable to the 1979 accident at the 
three mile island nuclear plant 
 
oct 8 
the charlotte nc observer on cigarette ads 
when surgeon general antonia novello said the tobacco 
industry must stop its death dealing to women and children 
tobacco industry officials huffily said she was wrong to try to 
keep cigarette ads away from women 
but the tobacco industry does not target its ads to women like 
antonia novello many cigarette ads are aimed at young relatively 
uneducated women the women most likely to make uninformed 
decisions about smoking and a group still of childbearing age 
lung cancer now kills more women than any other type of cancer 
although health officials say cigarette smoking is harmful to the 
fetus about 25 percent of the nations pregnant women smoke 
throughout their pregnancies that smoking causes 4000 babies to 
be born dead each year the surgeon general said 
people do have the right to decide for themselves whether they 
want to smoke cigarettes but tobacco companies behave like pushers 
when they try to exploit the least informed

democrats delayed senate finance committee 
consideration of a deficitreduction plan today after president 
bush backed away from his endorsement of higher taxes on the rich 
to pay for a cut in taxes on capital gains 
in view of the apparent reversal of position by the president 
last evening we will now have to reconsider what the appropriate 
course of action will be senate majority leader george j 
mitchell told reporters 
its obviously a difficult circumstance for all concerned 
mitchell said 
the finance committee postponed a morning session scheduled to 
begin work on a plan that was to have included the capitalgains 
cut long favored by bush to meet democratic demands the plan also 
included higher income tax rates on the wealthy who would benefit 
most from the capitalgains reduction 
we thought until last night that the finance committee 
plan would be acceptable mitchell said 
senate republican leader bob dole said in a senate speech that 
news organizations are unfairly portraying republicans as favoring 
the rich some democrats are now trying to force us to take 
capital gains in order to get more money to spend by raising tax 
rates dole said 
dole denied that bush had made any decision tuesday to drop 
support of a deal that would include capital gains and higher 
rates he listened to us dole said referring to a group of 
republican senators he didnt announce his position at all he 
didnt acquiesce in what we said 
but a senior administration official who briefed reporters after 
the meeting portrayed it differently 
the members of congress the official said told bush that he 
wasnt going to get the kind of capital gains he wants meaning 
congress would not accept a cut in the capital gains tax that would 
be low enough to satisfy bush and would insist on unacceptable 
increases in taxes on the rich 
the conclusion was to forget all of it said the official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity he said fine we dont 
need either one of them 
other republicans who attended the session gave yet another 
slant 
our uniform position was that we will not go up on the rates 
no matter what sen bob packwood of oregon said after he and 
other gop lawmakers met with bush on tuesday the president agreed 
with that consensus added packwood the senior republican on the 
senate finance committee 
stop trying to buy us off with capital gains sen ted 
stevens ralaska cautioned democrats 
the presidential flipflop only a few hours after he publicly 
said that higher rates on the wealthy would be fine in exchange for 
a capital gains cut clouded attempts to write a 500 billion 
deficitreduction plan 
packwood announced bushs turnabout which was confirmed by 
senior administration officials at about the time congress two 
top taxwriters were signaling they were ready to accept the 
capital gains bargain as part of a deficit agreement 
under terms of a stopgap spending bill that bush signed tuesday 
congress has until oct 19 to agree on a deficit plan taxwriting 
committees in the house and senate are considering packages that 
include increased taxes on gasoline tobacco and alcohol a capital 
gains cut and higher taxes on the rich 
republican senators apparently convinced the president that the 
capital gains cut offered by sen lloyd bentsen dtexas was not 
good enough to justify the upperincome tax rate increase that 
bentsen wanted 
bushs demand to cut taxes on capital gains the profits from 
the sale of investments has been a bone of contention with 
congress since the 1988 presidential campaign the president says 
the reduction is necessary to stimulate investment and create jobs 
democratic leaders have resisted by arguing there is no evidence 
the economy would benefit and by hammering away at the fact that 80 
percent of the tax cut would go to those with incomes over 100000 
a year 
at a news conference tuesday morning bush said for the first 
time that he could accept higher tax rates on the rich to win a 
capital gains reduction several republican lawmakers then arranged 
a meeting with the president and we all put up our hands and 
said no deal on rates at all packwood recounted he just 
acquiesced in it 
bush asked the gop lawmakers if they would hold fast to such a 
position packwood said and to the man in the room every 
single person said we will support that 
capital gains are fully taxed at the same rates that apply to 
wages and other income 15 percent 28 percent and 33 percent 
bentsens proposal would result in a top rate of 231 percent on 
capital gains realized by the wealthiest americans in return the 
plan would require those highestincome people to pay a top tax 
rate of 33 percent up from the present 28 percent 
the plan also would raise a special levy called the alternative 
minimum tax which is designed to ensure that highincome people 
pay a fair amount of tax regardless of how many legitimate 
deductions they have 
the quick shift of positions by the president and lawmakers from 
both parties highlighted the difficulty of giving a special tax 
break to one group and trying to pay for it by changing another tax 
provision 
in this case the problem arises from the fact that fewer than 
half of the nations wealthiest people reported any capital gains 
on tax returns filed last year 
as congressional budget negotiators resumed work on the 
deficitreduction plan tuesday lawmakers predicted that a 
twopenny tax on home heating oil and a delay in unemployment 
benefits both of which drew widespread objections to the earlier 
proposal are likely to be dropped 
the impact on medicare recipients likely will be cushioned 
lawmakers said but taxes on gasoline tobacco and alcohol almost 
certainly will rise under the new 500 billion plan

the arizona republic phoenix on the persian gulf 
predicting the future is a job best left to prophets and gypsy 
fortunetellers it is a risky business in any circumstance and is 
even more so in the byzantine world of the middle east 
all sorts of fanciful scenarios are being concocted by socalled 
military analysts as to how a usiraq battle would unfold 
they all end with the us winning a decisive victory with minimal 
loss of life 
the scenarios are all very neat the good guys win and the bad 
guys lose 
but of all human activities war is perhaps the least 
predictable there never was a war that conformed to expectations 
if war breaks out in kuwait this much is certain it will 
develop in directions that are utterly unpredictable it will not 
be neat or surgical or sanitary it will be what war has always 
been ugly and vicious and more deadly than anyone can imagine 
no one should be fooled by the glitzy videogame scenarios being 
spun by armchair generals and sunshine soldiers war in the persian 
gulf would not be a tom clancy novel or a clint eastwood movie 
william tecumseh sherman said war is hell because that is 
precisely what it is

the state columbia sc on linking israel to the persian 
gulf 
when world leaders go upon a world stage such as the u n 
general assembly they do not as a rule speak lightly or 
intentionally misspeak 
as he joined the parade of presidents and potentates who kicked 
off the current session of the world bodys general assembly 
george bush quite naturally concentrated on iraqs aug 2 takeover 
of kuwait and its subsequent refusal to leave even though much of 
the world operating largely with un sanction has made it 
absolutely clear that the iraqi action is totally unacceptable 
conduct that must be reversed 
during his address president bush made this observation in 
the aftermath of iraqs unconditional departure from kuwait i 
truly believe there may be differences permanently for the states 
of the persian gulf themselves to build new arrangements for 
stability and for all the states and peoples of the region to 
settle the conflict that divides the arabs from israel 
earlier at the united nations french president francois 
mitterand said if iraq would declare its determination to 
withdraw from kuwait and free the hostages all things might be 
possible that got a rise out of iraqi despot saddam hussein who 
has been demanding that the arabisraeli dispute and the complex 
lebanon question be put on the table with the kidnapping and rape 
of kuwait 
it does sound like both bush and mitterand might be 
willing to make such a linkage one day and that surely sends 
shivers down the spine of israel the arabisraeli setto is 42 
years old and the israeli occupation of arab territories populated 
by palestinians goes back to the 1967 sixday war the civil war in 
lebanon that has led to partial occupation by syria dates back to 
the mid1970s 
those issues have defied solution despite endless efforts and 
israels security concerns are bound up in both the rape of kuwait 
is a matter of the moment an international crime of a most 
egregious variety that demands solution right now it was a mistake 
to link these matters even with the ambiguous words of diplomacy 
used by the french and american presidents

argus leader sioux falls sd on the purpose of textbooks 
for three years small bands of critics across the united states 
have been attacking the textbook series impressions 
the books are interesting and colorfully illustrated and they 
challenge students tey are a big improvement from the days of 
dick jane and spot and boring reading programs 
impressions appears far more likely than older books to 
encourage pupils to learn to read and think the intent does not 
appear to be instilling negative values as some critics might have 
you believe 
critics cite passages they claim promote witchcraft mysticism 
and other evils 
yes there is fantasy even tales that could be interpreted as 
rebellious or violent but childrens literature has dealt with 
such subjects for generations in for example little red riding 
hood and huckleberry finn 
textbooks should not instill values thats the responsibility 
of parents and churches textbooks should instill a sense of wonder 
and curiosity impressions has the potential to do that job 
well

the meridian miss star on education in japan 
the japanese feel they have much to learn from the american 
education system but in view of the muchheralded performance of 
japanese students what can we learn from them 
the cultural diversity that is one of our strengths also 
presents challenges to american educators that the japanese dont 
have to worry about secondly japan has no americanstyle 
tradition of individualism the individual is subordinate to the 
group in japanese culture which makes group learning easier 
there are other qualities of japanese culture we could learn 
from foremost is the absolute priority that is placed on 
education japanese children go to school more hours a week and 
many more days a year than us children japanese teachers are 
paid on the average 60 percent higher than us teachers honor the 
profession in tangible ways and it will attract bright and 
committed people 
ingrained in japanese parents is the principle that education 
matters more than anything else for their children familyimposed 
standards of educational discipline as well as heavy parental 
involvement in schools are the norm widespread emulation of that 
aspect of japanese culture would probably do more than anything 
else to improve us student performance

president alfredo christiani of el salvador did his best to 
convince onthefence members of congress recently that he is 
indeed calling the shots in his wartorn country and that progress 
is being made in the case of the murder of six jesuit priests last 
year fortunately it looks like no one was fooled 
cristiani was hoping to convince the lawmakers to reject a 
measure that would cut military aid to el salvador in half 
since the civil war began the united states has sent el 
salvador more than 45 billion in military and economic aid yet 
the war continues to drag on more than 73000 people have died

the milwaukee journal on female sportswriters 
a female reporter denise tom was denied access to the 
cincinnati bengals locker room by coach sam wyche after a monday 
night game in seattle this episode came amidst a furor over a 
complaint by lisa olson a boston sports reporter that several 
naked new england patriots surrounded her in the team locker room 
sept 17 and made lewd comments to her while she was conducting 
interviews 
let it be understood that reporters male or female do not go 
into locker rooms because they want to but because that is their 
job postgame interviews with players and coaches are necessary to 
the reporters stories 
but some athletes seem to treat locker rooms as personal 
playpens their immaturity perhaps is understandable maybe 
inevitable management pays them millions groupies and other fans 
lionize them agents pamper them they spend much of their lives 
shielded from responsibility 
they need a spanking in the form of a major fine or suspension 
or both an athlete who exposes himself is guilty not only of 
childish behavior but possibly of an illegality as well 
as for wyche his excuse that he didnt want a woman in a locker 
room full of naked men is beside the point cant a quarterback or 
linebacker put on a towel or a bathrobe for a few minutes and be 
interviewed before heading into the shower room cant a room be 
set aside for postgame interviews 
no one expects an athlete physically and mentally exhausted 
after a tough game to show impeccable manners while being peppered 
with sometimes tough questions but no one is demanding perfect 
behavior just common courtesy if athletes and coaches arent 
capable of that then they arent entitled to call themselves 
professionals and they shouldnt be in the nfl with the real men

financial times london on the us budget and economy 
us budgetmaking has become a lamentable shambles nine months 
of negotiation ended in rejection by the congress last friday 
true the proposed 40 billion package of tax increases and 
spending cuts was little more than a token gesture but it was 
better than nothing even so a hint of higher taxes and reduced 
entitlements were too much for nervous congressmen to countenance 
in the runup to novembers elections 
the united states may be moving into an era of disappointingly 
slow increases in living standards and unpredictable exchange rate 
crises the unprecedented decline of the value of the dollar during 
a major international crisis is thus a harbinger of instability to 
come 
higher national savings are essential if this difficult period 
is to be shortlived a goal to which the elimination of the 
structural budget deficit would make a valuable contribution this 
is a vicious circle voters expect little of politicians and 
politicians respond to their cynicism by confirming it if no one 
can break the circle the voters themselves will pay the price

the bangkok thailand post on the reunification of germany 
there is one germany again and it seems like the world will be a 
better place for it 
the vows of the german leaders to stay a nation at peace sound 
more sincere and believable than those of earlier this century a 
world which fought two world wars against the european power has 
decided to give the german people a chance once again to decide and 
direct their destiny 
and quite rightly so sins of the fathers may not properly be 
avenged upon the sons and daughters the germany of today is so far 
different from that of the past that the field marshals and hitler 
are no doubt spinning in their unmarked graves it is affluent 
independent and its people are dedicated far more to democracy than 
to proving german superiority 
naturally there are some voices of trepidation among the 
congratulations but the lessons of history are for learning 
not for enduring the evidence of the past 45 years indicates 
that germans learned these lessons 
despite the terrors of those two wars and the memories of some 
the true danger is not of a resurgence of hitlerian stupidity 
it is like the danger of japan the enormous economic power of 
a vital hardworking nation fuelled by a committed work force 
the world will be watching to see how much added responsibility 
germany is willing to shoulder as the price of its unity 
the first test comes quickly european economic unity comes in 
1992 and germany must move fast even before that event to show 
its neighbors and the rest of the world that it will assume 
intelligent responsibility as a price for its economic dominance of 
europe 
much of the world already views european unity as a license to 
protectionism germany would do well to help ease those fears and 
the sooner the better

the german economy will keep picking up steam as 
industrial growth slows in other leading nations the countrys 
central bank chief said wednesday 
however bundesbank president karl otto poehl acknowledged the 
persian gulf crisis and the costs of unification present formidable 
challenges for the economic powerhouse 
during a speech wednesday poehl outlined how the recently 
united country of nearly 78 million people has become the 
locomotive of growth for the world economy 
and this role will be further strengthened poehl added 
during his speech to international banking supervisors from about 
100 nations 
he said economic expansion in germany which has europes 
strongest industrial base comes during a situation of clearly 
weakening growth in a whole series of important industrialized 
nations 
poehl did not name any other countries during his speech in 
frankfurts st pauls church 
the area of what was once west germany is expected to have a 39 
percent growth in its gross national product this year the same as 
last year reliable figures for the ravaged economy in the former 
east germany are not available 
by way of comparison the united states expects a growth rate of 
only 13 percent this year leading to fears of a recession last 
years growth rate was 25 percent 
west germanys growth rate last year was 22 trillion marks 
14 trillion at current rates trailing only the united states 
and japan 
also last year the west german trade surplus was 140 billion 
marks 90 billion at current rates the highest in the world 
poehl sounded several notes of caution wednesday including the 
enormous expense involved in bringing east germanys industry up to 
westernstandards 
those expenses will add to the national debt according to 
poehl 
poehl said the gulf crisis which is driving up oil costs 
presents another challenge but added that inflation in germany 
would stay below 3 percent this year 
germans remain extremely wary of inflation mindful that 
skyrocketing prices and the resulting instability led to the rise 
of adolf hitlers third reich 
inflationary dangers led west german officials in the late 1980s 
to resist us calls to become the worlds economic engine the 
very role that poehl has established for the merged nation 
also in the late 1980s officials in bonn worried that overly 
rapid growth would undercut the strength of the west german mark 
germany formally united last week faces other economic 
challenges beyond the gulf crisis and keeping inflation at bay 
foreigners have shown a reluctance to invest in what was east 
germany where problems of land ownership and bloated work forces 
have compounded ordinary risks in addition many of the businesses 
are literally falling apart 
nearly 450000 workers in what was east germany are out of jobs 
and another 18 million put in short hours in what amount to 
makework jobs 
chancellor helmut kohl has said the need to keep the german mark 
stable and strong will curb financial outlays to rebuild the 
economy in the east 
elmar pieroth an economics expert from kohls christian 
democratic union says it may take 775 billion in private 
investment and public financing over the next five years

police arrested the husband of benazir 
bhutto on kidnapping charges wednesday and the ousted prime 
minister called the arrest another effort by the armybacked 
government to force her from politics 
asif ali zardari had been expected to be the main target of the 
corruption investigations against ms bhuttos government which 
was ousted in august after just 20 months in power 
police arrested zardari for kidnapping a pakistaniborn british 
citizen and extorting 800000 from him he was taken into custody 
and charged with kidnapping and extortion 
at a news conference later wednesday at her home ms bhutto 
said she will not be intimiated and blackmailed by these gutter 
politicians 
a few days ago a federal minister in the caretaker government 
came to see me and told me that i should not contest the oct 24 
parliamentary election if i did then i would be disqualified and 
asif imprisoned ms bhutto said 
zardari was charged in the april kidnapping of businessman 
murtaza hussain bukhari of england zardari was taken for 
interrogation to the federal investigation agency which is 
comparable to the fbi 
authorities said he would not be able to apply for bail until 
thursday 
i fear for his safety and his life ms bhutto told 
reporters i knew they would do something i had warned asif 
he told me to be brave and continue the struggle 
when bukhari reported the alleged abduction to police and the 
british embassy in islamabad he implicated zardari he also sent 
letters detailing the alleged events to ms bhutto and to president 
ghulam ishaq khan 
both zardari and ms bhutto contend the case was fabricated 
ms bhutto wed zardari in a highly publicized arranged marriage 
in december 1987 exactly a year before she became the first woman 
leader of a modern moslem nation they have a 2yearold son and a 
9monthold daughter 
the president dismissed her government aug 6 accusing 
officials of corruption incompetence and abuse of power 
supporters and critics alike have blamed zardari for ms 
bhuttos downfall 
zardari an avid polo player with a jetsetter reputation has 
been accused by the pakistani media and the armybacked caretaker 
government of demanding commissions of lucrative government 
contracts and using the stateowned banks as his personal fund 
ordering huge loans for friends with little or no collateral and 
putting the institutions on the verge of bankruptcy 
he has vehemently denied the allegations which earned him the 
nickname mr 10 percent 
ms bhutto is being tried by special onejudge tribunals in 
lahore and karachi on four charges of misconduct and abuse of 
power she has called the charges a political vendetta aimed at 
discrediting her leftleaning pakistan peoples party and forcing 
her to quit politics

slap bracelets may be a new fashion 
necessity for chic children but they wont be seen in elementary 
schools here since educators decided the fabriccovered steel 
ornaments are dangerous 
the 9inch bracelets come in wild patterns and bright colors 
they coil around the wrist when slapped against it 
if the fabric covering comes off the sharp steel edge could cut 
hands and arms says joseph longobardi principal of the colonial 
and siwanoy elementary schools he ordered the ban last week 
principals at the two other grade schools in this new york city 
suburb said they will announce a ban in their school newsletters 
i have four kids of my own longobardi said i know how 
popular these things are but the possibility of injury does 
exist because of that sharp cutting edge 
in connecticut walgreens pulled slap bracelets from the shelves 
of 16 stores tuesday after a 4yearold girl was reportedly cut by 
one 
gene murtha president of main street toy of simsbury conn 
which makes the original slap wrap and sells it for 249 said 
his product causes no injuries the culprits he said are cheap 
imitations made in taiwan and sold illegally in this country for as 
little as 99 cents 
the metal is inferior lowgrade caliber steel with poor 
quality fabric he said of the knockoffs the sealing is also 
inferior the steel can either break through or snap through and 
cause injury 
his product which took a year to develop is made of highgrade 
steel with rounded edges and covered by doubleknit fabric that is 
tightly sealed he said 
we havent had any consumer complaints he said 
longobardi said he banned the toy after hearing of an injury in 
the west orchard elementary school in chappaqua 
officials there said an elementary school student who had 
removed the material covering needed three stitches on her hand 
after she was cut by an exposed bracelet edge 
main street toy has shipped nearly 1 million of the original 
slap wraps since the fad started this summer the company is now 
shipping about 200000 of the toys each week 
a parents call to walgreens in wallingford conn prompted the 
district manager to order bracelets that were foreign copies of the 
slap wrap pulled from all connecticut stores said maryellen 
thielen corporate spokeswoman for walgreens in deerfield ill 
were an extremely conservative company and we do react 
simply as a precaution we did remove them from the shelves she

pop impresario george martin said 
wednesday the beatles might not have become superstars had they 
started out in the 1990s 
he was speaking after presenting the john lennon songwriting 
awards to three students at salford college of technology near 
manchester the day after what would have been lennons 50th 
birthday 
john was not all that keen on education said martin who 
was lennons producer if he had been around now i dont think 
the beatles would have broken through 
martin described lennon as a rebel who did not want to be 
bothered with small details like music and reading and writing he 
wanted to get down to the real nub of things 
john could not read or write music and i think if he had tried 
to get this award in 1990 he would not have stood a chance

the top body of polands former communist 
government learned of a theft and corruption ring in the security 
service in 1984 but suspended a criminal investigation the 
government said wednesday 
interior minister krzysztof kozlowski a former roman catholic 
journalist who took over the law enforcement department in july 
said there was no proof of individual guilt in the apparent 
coverup but investigations continue 
at that time president wojciech jaruzelski was the head of the 
thenruling body the communist party politburo 
the disclosures came at a rare news conference held by top 
interior ministry officials most communist officials have left the 
agency in the year since the noncommunist solidarity government 
took power 
former interior minister miroslaw milewski and six former 
associates were arrested saturday on charges they were involved in 
the corruption ring milewski a hardliner was a communist party 
politburo member and central committee secretary in charge of 
internal affairs in the early 1980s 
the case will be the first major prosecution of a communist 
official by the countrys new authorities 
also saturday two former police generals were arrested on 
charges of directing the murder of the rev jerzy popieluszko a 
prosolidarity priest beaten and drowned by secret police in 
october 1984 
the milewski case codenamed the iron affair involved people 
of polish origin establishing companies in the west said andrzej 
milczanowski chief of the state protection office 
through insurance fraud breakins and thefts carried out in the 
unidentified western countries the companies accumulated gold 
precious stones jewelery and other valuables that would be shipped 
back to poland by intelligence agents he said milczanowski said 
the crimes began in 1968 
at a minimum the perpetrators gathered 143 pounds of gold he 
said that would be about 2090 troy ounces worth 820000 at 
todays prices 
milewski was accused of accepting gold and jewelry stolen by the 
ring 
the arrest of milewski and his associates whose names have not 
been disclosed stems from a 1984 investigation into the affair by 
an internal interior ministry commission milczanowski said 
the commission assembled a report of several dozen pages and 
said the case should be prosecuted he said 
however the countrys then highest decisionmaking body 
decided to suspend the case and no further action was taken 
milewski soon retired 
kozlowski said the suspension of criminal proceedings was a 
decision of the communist party politburo but that there was no 
evidence to link any individual with a coverup 
those involved people who were under very serious 
accusations received party reprimands and milewski ended his 
political career a few months later kozlowski said 
jaruzelski who is due to step down in december after the 
countrys first popular presidential vote headed the politburo 
from 1981 until assuming the presidency in july 1989 
milczanowski said he was not at liberty to release the names of 
the others arrested with milewski without the prosecutor generals 
permission 
however he said no one from current political life was 
recommended for prosecution

secretary of state james a baker iii on 
wednesday released assurances from israel that it would not settle 
soviet jewish refugees on land won in the 1967 mideast war 
the assurances were in a letter baker worked out with israeli 
foreign minister david levy to end weeks of negotiations between 
the two governments over a 400 million us housing loan 
guarantee 
baker in announcing the agreement he had reached with levy 
said last week that the foreign minister had offered assurances 
considerably beyond israels longstanding commitment not to use 
the usbacked loans to house soviet jews in the territories 
but the letter did not appear to break new ground and prime 
minister yitzhak shamir said sunday that the assurances did not 
cover jerusalem he announced meanwhile that a new jewish 
neighborhood will be built in the part of the city jordan held from 
1948 until 1967 and termed by president bush as occupied 
territory 
the bush administration considers settlement of soviet refugees 
or any other jews on the west bank in gaza and in east jerusalem 
to be an obstacle to peace the administration supports the arab 
demand that most or all of the territory be relinquished by israel 
shamir has offered to negotiate the territorys future after 
five years of limited selfrule by the palestinian arabs who make 
up most of the population of the west bank and gaza 
but he does not consider the capital to be occupied territory 
and said sunday that jerusalem is an integral part of israel and 
the building of the city will continue unhampered 
a strong jewish presence on the west bank and in gaza could make 
surrender of the land more difficult however former israeli prime 
minister menachem begin agreed in 1978 to the elimination of all 
jewish settlements in sinai as part of a peace treaty with egypt 
levy in the letter states the government of israels policy is 
not to direct or settle soviet jews beyond the green line which 
delineates the boundaries of israel before the 1967 war 
the foreign minister does not specifically mention east 
jerusalem which was not part of israel before the war 
the two other main assurances 
the housing loan guarantees will be restricted to the 
geographic areas administered by israel before the war 
no special incentives are given to encourage soviet jews to 
settle in territories captured during the war 
the state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said 
tuesday that baker and levy had agreed in their negotiations that 
the letter would be made public she declined to take questions 
wednesday on the contents 
about 90000 jews now live among the 15 million arabs on the 
west bank and in gaza only a tiny percentage 1 to 2 percent of 
soviet jewish refugees are among them

for years university of iowa researchers 
have injected hundreds of dogs with radioactive isotopes in the 
quest to improve human health now its time to dispose of the 
carcasses because storage capacity is full 
a plan to use a refurbished 25yearold incinerator to burn 900 
barrels of the slightly radioactive carcasses has angered 
environmental groups they want a public hearing to assess the 
risks that may be associated with spewing radioactive ash into the 
iowa countryside 
it is the best way right now to do this we cant think of a 
better safer way to do it said william twaler he is director 
of the universitys health protection office and will oversee the 
incineration 
we anticipate most of the radioactive material will stay in 
the ash probably about 85 percent and maybe even 100 percent its 
not very precise said twaler 
we dont anticipate the majority of it going up the smoke 
stack in the first place but if youre asking me if theres a 
zero percent risk id have to say i dont know 
environmental advocates and iowans for animal rights want a 
hearing before any of the more than 1000 carcasses are 
incinerated their request in a letter sept 28 to university 
president hunter rawlings has gone unanswered 
our main concern is that the public is not involved in the 
whole process theres been no public discussion about the 
operation we have questions about the ash disposal how 
radioactive will this ash be said joe bolkcom of iowa city a 
spokesman for environmental advocates 
twaler said he has had no word from university officials about a 
hearing and plans to start incinerating about eight barrels a day 
later this week on the oakdale campus a few miles northwest of the 
downtown campus 
he would not give the exact ay saying he feared protests the 
staterun university has received the necessary permits to operate 
the incinerator from the iowa department of health and the iowa 
department of natural resources 
paul connett professor of chemistry at st lawrence university 
in canton ny and author of a weekly newsletter called waste 
not said he fears any radioactive ash released from the 
incinerator would enter the food chain settling on plants fed to 
cows and contaminating their milk 
he was in iowa city last weekend for a medical waste management 
conference 
its a stupid idea it never ceases to amaze me how 
incinerator advocates resemble the medieval alchemists in their 
ideas that you could somehow burn something and make it 
disappear said brian lipsett a research analyst for the 
citizens clearinghouse for hazardous waste in arlington va 
radioactive materials arent destroyed by incineration and in 
fact will be dispersed throughout the community lipsett said 
paul cooper university veterinarian in charge of animal care 
said live dogs were injected with tiny pellets or microspheres 
containing lowlevel radioactive materials 
the microspheres are primarily used as tracers in the dogs 
blood streams for cardiovascular research designed to improve human 
health he said 
after the dogs died the school planned to store their carcasses 
until the radioactive isotopes decayed in nonradioactive elements 
in about three years however researchers have begun using new 
isotopes that take longer to decay and the university is out of 
storage space 
the quantity of the radioactive material is very very low to 
begin with said don flater chief of the radiological bureau of 
the iowa health department nature has already taken its course 
most of the radioactive isotopes have decayed and are mostly 
gone 
a better alternative to incineration would be burying the 
barrels but flater said that is illegal in iowa 
the university could avoid the controversy by shipping the 
carcasses to one of the nations three radioactive waste dumps in 
washington state nevada or south carolina twaler said 
that would be cost prohibitive it would be something like 
1000 per drum that gets very expensive he said

miami is living on borrowed time new orleans 
future looks bleak and the worlds coastal cities face a growing 
risk of catastrophic storms and floods as sea levels rise from 
global warming a report warned wednesday 
global warming is projected to cause sea levels to rise 12 
inches to more than 3 feet over the next century according to 
scientists with the un intergovernmental panel on climate change 
but even without global warming many of the worlds most 
beautiful and populous cities face an increasing threat of 
flooding according to cities at risk prepared by three 
scientists at the university of east anglia 
this report puts a whole lot of things together that have been 
done on an isolated or ad hoc basis said allen miller executive 
director for the center for global change at the university of 
maryland 
about 500 million people around the world could be affected 
according to the paper which looked at the future of miami new 
orleans alexandria bangkok dhaka hamburg leningrad london 
shanghai sydney and thessalonika 
a variety of human activities are exacerbating existing 
problems and increasing the vulnerablity of cities to the future 
impact of global warming said dr mick kelly who wrote the 
report with dr rk turner and rc kay 
global warming otherwise known as the greenhouse effect occurs 
as rising levels of carbon dioxide and other pollutants trap the 
suns heat in the atmosphere 
inappropriate development and illconsidered flood control 
programs contribute to the problems faced by coastal cities in 
addition land levels are sinking because of erosion or the 
extraction of underground water 
sea levels meanwhile are rising for reasons not fully 
understood an increase of one degree has caused the oceans to 
expand scientists say while melting glaciers and possibly melting 
polar icecaps have added to the problem 
miami faces both erosion and runaway development much of which 
has taken place since the last major storm hit the city in 1966 
the report said 
kelly said the city is overdue for a storm and the hazard will 
increase substantially in the future as global warming heats the 
oceans which give energy to tropical storms 
these people are living on borrowed time kelly said 
miami has to face not only the possiblity of natural hurricane 
activity but also an increase due to global warming 
the report notes that five of miamis seven bridges to the 
mainland are subject to flooding it suggests that miami and other 
coastal cities pay more attention to emergency planning 
miami beach built on a barrier islandlagoon is eroding so is 
an estimated 90 percent of the sandy shoreline of the united 
states the report said 
miami already has spent more than 68 million rebuilding the 
beach and more money will be needed to save the dozens of hotels 
and condominiums built on the ocean front it said 
new orleans is suffering from construction of a different sort 
a half century of flood control projects by the us army corps of 
engineers that have done more harm than good the report said 
levees reservoirs floodgates and enlarged channels have been 
built to solve specific problems but together they have 
exacerbated flooding 
the levees killed the deltas by blocking the flow of mud that 
replaced soil washed away in the river the projects helped destroy 
the salt marshes that serve as a buffer between the city and the 
sea 
the marshes are dying at a rate of 40 square miles a year 
according to jim titus of the us environmental protection agency 
the report warned some parts of new orleans are now nine 
meters yards below peak river flow a disaster is waiting to 
happen 
bangladesh meanwhile is considering a 10 billion flood 
control system financed by the world bank which environmentalists 
fear could create more problems than it solves 
there is a growing body of opinion that this sort of 
engineering offers only a shortterm respite kelly said 
ultimately the thing we should be doing is limiting greenhouse 
gases but in the shortterm we will need to improve our coastal 
defenses and we need to start now 
basic protection of cities at greatest risk would cost more than 
100 billion while 500 billion may be required for coastal 
defense and flood protection works worldwide the report said 
the report was published by the bureau of national affairs 
international a subsidiary of the washingtonbased bureau of 
national affairs inc a publisher of environmental business and 
regulatory information

shuttle discovery sailed 
out of orbit and landed wednesday after a fourday flight that 
boosted nasas confidence and sent a spacecraft on a fiveyear 
mission to explore the suns poles 
if you criticize our mistakes then you must also acknowledge 
our successes space shuttle director and former astronaut robert 
crippen said after completion of the first shuttle flight in nearly 
six months 
im elated he added its been a long hot summer ill 
tell you that its nice to be back flying again it is a high day 
for us 
about 5500 spectators cheered as discovery touched down at 657 
am pdt just seconds before the sun rose over hills to the east 
it was the third smallest crowd for any shuttle landing open to 
public viewing 
congratulations on a pictureperfect mission mission 
controls brian duffy told the five astronauts 
the astronauts stepped out of the shuttle into sunshine an hour 
after the landing about four hours later shuttle commander dick 
richards was given a small gold model of ulysses then richards 
pilot robert cabana and mission specialists bill shepherd bruce 
melnick and tom akers boarded two jets to take them home to 
houston 
discoverys 17 millionmile flight was the first since april 
the longest gap between shuttle missions since they resumed after 
the 1986 explosion that destroyed challenger and killed seven crew 
members 
the latest flight helped bolster morale at the national 
aeronautics and space administration which has been plagued by 
hydrogen fuel leaks in the shuttles columbia and atlantis and by a 
flawed mirror that severely impaired the 15 billion hubble space 
telescope 
like any great team occasionally theres losing streaks 
richards said before flying to houston today is a day we can say 
this losing streak is over and were going on to great things in 
the future 
six hours after they lifted off from cape canaveral fla on 
saturday discoverys astronauts deployed the ulysses spacecraft on 
its 186billionmile mission to study the suns high latitudes and 
poles 
ulysses seems to be working perfectly well said roger 
bonnet director of scientific programs for the european space 
agency which operates the 250 million solar explorer in a joint 
mission with nasa 
bonnet praised the 750 million mission as a symbol of future 
cooperation between europe and the united states 
about an hour before touchdown discoverys twin braking rockets 
fired allowing the shuttle to plunge out of orbit and dash through 
earths atmosphere 
the shuttles twin sonic booms cracked loudly waking santa 
barbara and ventura residents as discovery crossed the coast and 
descended toward the 15000footlong concrete runway 22 on rogers 
dry lake in the mojave desert 
i thought someone was rattling the walls in the next room 
said ventura county fire dispatcher denis miller 
thats gorgeous spectator valeri leahey 29 of camarillo 
said as sunlight glistened off the descending shuttle 
discovery touched down on pavement so nasa could test its brakes 
a test aimed at eventually having shuttles land at cape 
canaveral 
crippen said discoverys brakes apparently performed well only 
the second test for the new carbon brakes but he wont decide 
until spring when to have shuttles land in florida discovery 
sustained only a few dings to its heatshielding tiles he 
added 
ulysses was 31 million miles from earth on wednesday speeding 
at 25451 mph toward a february 1992 swing past jupiter said don 
meyer nasas operations manager for ulysses at jet propulsion 
laboratory in pasadena 
the spacecraft will use the solar systems largest planet as a 
gravity slingshot to become the first spacecraft to fly 
perpendicular to the plane in which the planets orbit the sun 
that will allow ulysses to pass over the suns south pole in 
1994 and north pole in 1995 gathering information about the sun 
its magnetic field and the solar wind all of which affect earths 
climate 
bonnet said ulysses left earths orbit at a faster speed about 
34000 mph than any other spacecraft but it will not become the 
fastest spacecraft ever until it reaches jupiter where it will 
accelerate to about 89500 mph voyager 2 zoomed past the outer 
planets at speeds exceeding 80000 mph 
the next shuttle flight is scheduled for early november when 
atlantis will conduct a secret mission for the pentagon the flight 
had been scheduled for july but was delayed by hydrogen leaks 
in addition to deploying ulysses discoverys astronauts tested 
a voiceactivated camera system and started a small fire inside a 
sealed aluminum container so safety managers could observe how fire 
acts in the absence of gravity 
they also extended discoverys 50footlong robot arm to test 
the amount of decay on two pieces of material identical to that 
used on the solar panels of a communications satellite stranded in 
a uselessly low orbit 
intelsat an organization of countries that owns the 
communications satellite will study the amount of decay and decide 
whether it is worth sending astronauts on a rescue mission in 1992

a us air force jet crashed today in saudi arabia killing both 
crew members it was the third accident involving american military 
aircraft in the persian gulf region in three days 
in iraq meanwhile 400 americans and other foreign captives 
signed up for the first uschartered evacuation flight from iraq 
and kuwait since sept 22 the us flight had been scheduled to 
leave from baghdad later today 
most of the 400 were evacuated from kuwait and were taken by bus 
to the iraqi port of basra from there they had been scheduled to 
leave on an iraqi airways boeing747 for the iraqi capital 
while officials in baghdad said they had departed basra in 
washington the state department said without elaboration late this 
afternoon that the plane had not yet left basra 
and on the new york exchange the middle east crisis helped push 
oil prices briefly to a record 4115 a barrel today before 
falling back to 4088 in early trading that was 48 cents above 
tuesdays close of 4040 and higher than the previous record 
close of 3954 per barrel on sept 27 
the upward trend has been caused in part by the slayings monday 
of 19 palestinians in a clash with police in jerusalem and saddam 
husseins threat to retaliate against israel 
on tuesday saddam announced that iraq had added another missile 
to its arsenal and he said it could be launched against the 
targets of evil when the day of reckoning comes 
he made it clear he was referring to israel and the usled 
forces sent to saudi arabia after iraqi invaded kuwait on aug 2 
about 170000 us forces are deployed in the persian gulf region 
saddam has repeatedly tried to link the status of palestinians 
in the israelioccupied territories with his annexation of kuwait 
indicating he might withdraw from the emirate if israel pulls out 
of arab lands seized in 1967 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir was quoted today by a 
german newspaper in berlin as saying that the nations in the 
persian gulf will collapse like houses of cards if saddam stays 
in power 
in an interview with the berliner morgenpost newspaper shamir 
was also quoted as saying that the israelis do not want war but 
are prepared to retaliate if attacked by iraq 
lt cmdr jd van sickle a us military spokesman said the 
f111 fighter plane crashed in the southern arabian peninsula 
today while on a training mission and that the incident was under 
investigation the names of the two flyers were withheld pending 
notification of relatives 
eight marines are missing in the crash of two helicopters in the 
northern arabian sea on monday an air force f4 reconnaissance jet 
also went down that day killing both crew members 
today the navy said that search teams had found no indication 
that any of the eight marines had survived and it halted its 
search 
in addition to those killed in saudi arabia 13 other air force 
personnel were killed aug 29 in a crash of a c5 jet cargo plane 
in germany that aircraft was ferrying supplies and equipment to 
the saudi peninsula 
us officials said however that the overall safety record of 
us forces in the gulf remains at least as good as it would be for 
forces of the same size in the united states 
in washington the state department said more americans stranded 
in iraq and kuwait would be evacuated today the flight is to 
arrive in raleighdurham airport in north carolina on thursday 
after an overnight stop in london 
as before the americans on board will be limited to women and 
children and americans of arab ancestry it was the first 
usorganized charter out of the region since sept 22 when the 
state department said it would organize no further evacuation 
flights 
previous evacuation flights have transported about 1900 
americans out of iraq and kuwait recent state department estimates 
indicate there are more than 600 americans stranded in kuwait and 
more than 300 in iraq 
american and other western men are being held in iraq and 
kuwait many at strategic iraqi installations to prevent an attack 
by the multinational forces in the persian gulf region 
on tuesday state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
three more american men were recently detained by iraqi authorities 
two in iraq and one in kuwait many westerners are believed still 
in hiding to avoid detention primarily in kuwait which iraq 
invaded in a dispute over land oil and money 
besides the westerners caught in iraq and kuwait thousands of 
foreign workers of mostly arab and asian descent are stranded in 
squalid desert camps along the jordanian and turkish borders

declaring that the time for foot dragging has 
ended federal safety officials issued wednesday a list of 18 
most wanted safety improvements in air sea and land 
transportation 
the proposed improvements range from development of an 
aircollision avoidance system to adoption of state laws permitting 
uniformed police officers to confiscate drivers licenses on the 
spot when drivers fail or refuse tests to detect alcohol 
the national transportation safety board list seeks to spur 
movement by regulatory agencies industries and state and local 
governments to implement recommendations made by the board over the 
last two decades 
its a call to action said chairman james l kolstad our 
most wanted list of recommendations represents some of the biggest 
areas for life saving it is a tool that the safety board is using 
to help us get our job done 
i think on some issues there has been foot dragging he 
said noting that federal rulemaking procedures can delay 
implementation for five years or more 
we need action now we hope that everyone will agree that the 
issues we have chosen to include in our most wanted list have a 
great potential to prevent accidents and save lives 
the safety board has no actual enforcement power it can only 
identify possible safety improvements and recommend they be 
implemented 
kolstad said he believes the highest priority item on the list 
is the recommendation for the passage of laws in all states to 
permit police officers to seize licenses of drivers who fail or 
refuse to take alcohol tests 
that is the single most important way to get drunk drivers off 
the road he said 
air accidents can be reduced he said by developing and 
requiring an airborne collision avoidance system a recommendation 
first made in 1969 and requiring a runway incursion system to 
prevent ground accidents 
the boards other most wanted safety improvements include 
legislation to allow alcohol testing if an operator of a 
recreational boat is suspected of being intoxicated 
implementation of a recommendation first issued in 1970 to 
require railroads to install signal and control systems to keep 
trains separated and prevent collisions 
require commuter aircraft to carry ground proximity warning 
devices 
make sweeping improvements in fishing vessel safety including 
legislative authority to require the licensing of captains and the 
installation of basic lifesaving gear including exposure suits in 
cold waters flooding detection and fire detection alarms coast 
guardapproved lifeboats or rafts and emergency radios with an 
independent power source 
require the screening of all commercial pilots to identify 
convicted alcohol and drug abusers require periodic reviews of 
pilots driver history records and require airlines to report 
pilots convicted as drug and alcohol abusers to the federal 
aviation administration for medical evaluation 
require improvements in railway tank car safety 
consider requiring adjustable seat belts in new cars to make 
them suitable and safe for children 
speed up research to learn the effects of fatigue sleepiness 
and sleep disorders on safety in all areas of transportation 
adopt new standards to incorporate materials in new school 
buses which will slow the spread of fire 
improve fire safety standards on passenger vessels including 
automatic devices to close doors when smoke detectors are 
activated 
adopt uniform regulations for drug and alcohol testing of all 
transportation employees responsible for operations and safety 
require wear limits for airplane wheel brakes 
improve the safety of heavy commercial trucks by detecting and 
preventing drug and alcohol abuse imposing medical standards and

a small crowd of space 
enthusiasts bundled against the numbing desert chill cheered the 
first space shuttle landing in nearly six months 
discoverys dawn touchdown wednesday drew about 5500 
spectators the thirdsmallest crowd for a landing open to the 
public but those who braved the 38degree cold were determined 
some visiting from as far as england 
the smallest crowd for a public shuttle landing at edwards was 
2200 when columbia landed jan 20 1990 top attendance was 
500000 when columbia landed on july 4 1982 some landings have 
been closed to the public 
scattered shouts of its here and there it is were 
heard as the signature twin sonic booms broke the silence of the 
mojave desert morning 
gasps were heard on the east shore of rogers dry lake as the 
sunrise glinted behind the descending shuttle 
thats gorgeous said valeri leahey 29 of camarillo who 
said it was her ninth shuttle landing 
i wanted to come out and see this myself its my once in a 
lifetime chance said bruce mclean 23 of essex england 
scattered applause and whoops rose into the air when the shuttle 
curved over the crowd and gently set down at 657 am

and crisis in the persian gulf to see the program continue and 
continue to promise for these kids 
there also were skeptics including barry dugan on vacation

president bush urged republicans to 
stand firm for the best budget deal possible as he campaigned 
for southern gop candidates wednesday dismissing differences with 
one of them on that very issue 
the president said he wielded the appropriations veto that led 
to a partial government shutdown because congress would otherwise 
have taken last weekend off 
i kept the pressure on and to make the point no more 
business as usual bush told a rally for florida gov bob 
martinez at a sweltering waterfront park 
bush left a mixed message on taxes as he went in quest of votes 
for republican candidates he had said tuesday that hed consider 
an increase in the highest income tax rates in exchange for a 
capital gains tax cut then met withrepublican senators who said 
hed dropped that idea but on wednesday bushs spokesman said 
the president had only listened to the senators and hadnt told 
them anything 
the budget message was a theme of his threestop swing lets 
get the job done members of congress he said in st petersburg 
i didnt come down here to assign blame but you know ive seen 
these surveys the american people are pretty smart they know 
where the action is and they know that congress has the 
responsibility to pass a budget and its about time that they met 
that responsibility 
bush said in raleigh nc that if the rest of congress were as 
careful with federal spending as sen jesse helms there wouldnt 
be a budget crisis to begin with 
helms denounced one budget deal bush endorsed and voted against 
a temporary settlement the senate finally approved to avert a 
government shutdown tuesday 
of course there are going to be differences bush said at a 
campaign breakfast for helms who is seeking a fourth senate term 
against former charlotte mayor harvey gantt in a race the pollsters 
now see as a tossup 
the president said differences with helms on one issue or 
another were beside the point 
the point is that if we had more senators like him we 
wouldnt be trying to solve some of these problems that should have 
been solved months ago years ago bush said 
republican defections especially in the house have been a 
major problem for the president and congressional leaders in trying 
to strike a budget deal to cut the deficit by 40 billion this year 
and by a total of 500 billion over the next five years 
bushs final campaign stop of the day was in atlanta home 
territory of rep newt gingrich the leader of conservatives who 
rebelled against the budget deal the president was appearing there 
to raise campaign funds for johnny isakson the republican 
candidate for governor of georgia he is rated a long shot against 
democratic lt gov zell miller 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
in atlanta bush again discussed the budget at a fundraising 
reception for isakson 
right now the federal budget process is like a huge rube 
goldberg machine out of control producing noise smoke heat and 
no light bush said sucking up more and more tax dollars on 
one end and churning them into spending programs without end 
but he said he is confident congress can pass a sound budget 
weve had a few days now for the smoke to clear bush said 
now its time to move forward

in st petersburg bush sought money and votes for martinez 
bidding for reelection in a close contest with democrat lawton 
chiles a former senator looking for a comeback 
it was the presidents first campaign foray since the budget 
crisis that led to a partial shutdown of federal facilities and 
threatened more a standoff resolved temporarily with government 
spending authority extended until oct 19 
bush demanded that the democratic congress make the hard 
choices and real reductions in spending that would produce a 
permanent settlement hed accept i will continue now to press 
hard for a budget that fulfills the spirit of that bipartisan plan 
and proves to the american people once and for all that we can deal 
with this deficit he said weve got to turn it around now 
he said he is dead serious about the deadline 10 days away

with a smirk on her face a lone soviet activist 
nearly caused a riot a block from the kremlin on wednesday by 
tossing hardtofind condoms into the air and demanding that 
prostitution be legalized 
we want to draw attention to the problem of prostitutes 
because they have no legal protection and because they are the 
objects of sexual abuse declared yevgenia debryanskaya a member 
of the fledgling libertarian party nor are they protected 
medically she said 
many in the crowd of more than 100 people including many soviet 
journalists shrieked and grabbed for the hundreds of americanmade 
condoms she scattered on the ground in front of the intourist 
hotel one of moscows bestknown workplaces for prostitutes 
passersby stopped in amazement and several joined in the 
scramble on one of moscows main thoroughfares 
defying the usually prudish soviet attitude toward sex ms 
debryanskaya also tossed a stack of englishlanguage manuals on 
safe sex into the air and the wind swept them across the sidewalk 
in the direction of the kremlin 
condoms like many consumer goods have never been plentiful in 
the soviet union sovietmade condoms are notorious for their poor 
quality and undependability western condoms sell for as much as 
the equivalent of 8 on the black market 
wednesdays protest also demonstrated the length to which groups 
will go to stand out among the growing number of soviet political 
organizations and the extent to which oncebanned activities are 
now tolerated although a halfdozen police were present at the 
unauthorized protest they made no effort to intervene other than 
keeping the sidewalk clear 
ms debyranskaya said the liberation party wanted the repeal of 
a law that punishes prostitution with fines as well as free medical 
care for prostitutes 
she said prostitutes do not even have the most elementary 
contraception devices condoms and in the age when aids is 
spreading they are particularly liable to infection 
at one point two other protesters unfurled a handwritten 
banner depicting a submarine and reading one nuclear submarine 
equals the cost of 5 billion condoms another sign read a 
sexual blockade on members of the communist party 
soviet officials have been slow to acknowledge the spread of 
aids which can be transmitted through sexual contact intravenous 
drug use or passed from an infected mother to her fetus 
in 1989 several cases were reported of babies being infected 
with aids through the use of contaminated hypodermic needles in 
soviet hospitals although soviet health officials have begun 
publicly discussing ways to treat those infected with aids 
statistics for the number of infected soviets are not available 
there are also no official figures on the number of soviet 
prostitutes although they do a brisk trade at hotels catering to 
foreigners and at train stations

john stewart bell a british theorhetical 
scientist who pointed to an answer to one of the basic questions of 
his science has died he was 62 
he died last week at a geneva hospital after suffering a stroke 
the european laboratory for particle physics said 
bell born in belfast northern ireland had worked since 1960 
at the 15nation lab located outside this swiss city and known by 
its former french acronym cern 
the labs director nobel laureate carlo rubbia of italy cited 
bells imposing contribution to physics which he said did 
much to unravel the paradoxes which riddle quantum theory 
 
quantum physics is based on the theory that energy is 
transmitted in definable units rather than constant streams 
bell was best known for 1964 research in which he postulated how 
simultaneous measurements on separate physical systems can be 
linked testing of bells theorem or bells inequality 
seems to have shown that the apparent coordination of particles 
that have flown too far apart for normal communication arises from 
the action of the measurement 
the tests appear to have resolved a basic question of physics 
is there a message within the basic particles that determines their 
behavior 
bell is survived by his wife mary who collaborated on some of 
his research and also works at the lab

record 
lets look for the higher ground he said thats my plan 
for the next 28 days

oileating bacteria worked when sprayed on a 
sensitive marsh fouled by a july oil spill proponents say but 
some scientists say theyre still worried about the safety of the 
cleanup technique 
speaking at a symposium on bioremediation at lamar university in 
beaumont proponents of the technique reported that microbetreated 
areas of morrow marsh on galveston bay were largely free of oil a 
month after the spill 
franz hiebert director of geoscience programs for alpha 
environmental inc said researchers found a wide variety of 
fishes swimming in and out of the marsh in the northern reaches 
of the bay near cedar bayou 
hieberts company sprayed the oileating bacteria in the marsh 
and other areas of galveston bay fouled by 700000 gallons of oil 
that spilled when a tanker collided with oil barges in the houston 
ship channel 
the bacteria also were used in june after the supertanker mega 
borg exploded 57 miles off galveston 
not everyone at tuesdays conference rallied behind 
bioremediation which has been used for years to treat sewage and 
hazardous waste and only recently was used on oil spills 
although studies done so far have been very encouraging 
there is plenty of research yet to be done said sarah liehr of 
the department of civil and environmental engineering at the 
university of houston 
among the issues to be resolved is whether phosphorus nitrogen 
and other nutrients mixed with the bacteria to stimulate their 
growth will cause algae to bloom or reproduce explosively algae 
blooms can deplete oxygen in the water 
norm novick of mobil oil corps toxicology department said 
the process clearly works on contaminated soils sludges and 
groundwater he said it has limited usefulness in cleaning up 
heavier petroleum products 
novick maintained that in most oil spills the organisms you 
need to eat the oil are already there evidence suggests that 
indigenous bacteria only need stimulation by nutrients to degrade 
spilled oil and that additional bacteria arent needed he said 
texas water commission chairman buck wynne iii said that during 
two recent spills the one thing we did show was that 
bioremediation didnt hurt anything 
it cost the state about 90000 to treat the june and july 
spills he said 
wynne expressed doubts that bacteria will be used routinely on 
spills until the technology wins the support of the federal 
government

education secretary lauro cavazos told a 
senate panel wednesday his department is moving aggressively to 
halt fraud waste and abuse and recover an estimated 78 billion 
in defaults in the federal student loan program 
cavazos said the government collected a record 7223 million in 
defaulted student loans in fiscal year 1990 an increase of about 
79 million over 1989 
he told a subcommittee of the senate that tough but 
fairminded regulations have recently been implemented 
they go as far as we felt we could go under the law at the 
time cavazos said they are working but they are not enough 
we need more statutory authority 
cavazoss testimony before the permanent subcommittee on 
investigations brought to a close a yearlong examination of 
problems in federal student financial aid programs 
chairman sam nunn dga said the legislative initiatives were 
welcome but heres tremendous authority in the department of 
education thats not been utilized he pointed to numerous times 
the department ignored warnings from its inspector generals office 
of problems within the loan program 
in brief it is not an exaggeration to say that we have heard 
no testimony or seen any documents that suggest the department has 
done even an adequate job in managing and overseeing its student 
loan program responsibilities nunn said 
nunn asked cavazos and officials accompanying him why it has 
taken years to correct flaws in the program and to update the 
agencys computer system so that questionable activities from 
unscrupulous trade schools can be detected 
as an example nunn showed documents of a trade school that had 
lost accreditation from two licensing agencies when the same 
owners changed the institutions name and moved its location he 
said the department recently approved the accreditation by a third 
agency 
the program seems to be just a joke isnt it nunn said 
sen edward kennedy dmass said it is clear that the 
current system does not protect students and it does not protect 
taxpayers either total federal insurance costs to cover defaults 
have increased from 239 million in 1980 to 24 billion in 1990 
there will always be some defaults in any loan guarantee 
programs but the amount we are spending now on student loan 
defaults is unacceptable 
however kennedy acknowledged cavazos had initiated some 
improvements 
cavazos said the agency has dramatically increased the 
number of onsite reviews of higher education institutions to 
determine compliance with student aid regulations he said 372 were 
conducted in fiscal year 1987 but more than 1200 were carried out 
in fiscal year 1990 ending in september 
cavazos said the departments successful debt collection 
activity includes using private collection agencies offsetting 
federal income tax refunds and collecting from the salaries of 
federally employed defaulters 
default collections from tax refunds totaled 261 million in 
fiscal 1990 with more than 439000 defaulters paying an average 
610 from federal tax refunds

president mikhail s gorbachev on wednesday 
ordered all major soviet cities to hold parades nov 7 marking the 
1917 bolshevik revolution apparently trying to squelch a boycott 
called by liberals 
the presidential decree was gorbachevs first public response to 
the liberal mayors of moscow and leningrad who last month called 
for abandoning the traditional revolution day celebrations because 
the dismal economic situation gave soviets nothing to celebrate 
other groups since have supported their call 
the anniversary of the 1917 revolution is one of the major 
holidays on the soviet calendar a day usually devoted to praising 
the glories of communism while the official ideology has fallen 
from its sacred position in politics in recent years many 
conservatives remain committed to upholding the old system 
using his broad executive powers gorbachev issued the decree 
ordering the date to be observed with military parades in moscow 
the capitals of the 14 other republics and in other cities where 
army or naval fleets are based the official tass news agency said 
gorbachev also instructed defense minister dimitri yazov to 
review the parade in red square in moscow 
the parades usually include tanks and rockets followed by a 
peoples demonstration of the citys residents 
may day another major soviet holiday was marked this year by 
counterdemonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in 
moscow as they passed through red square many shouted resign 
and jeered at gorbachev who suffered the embarrassment stoically 
for 20 minutes and then left the reviewing stand

chess players have long used systems of notation 
to record the moves of their games and to replay and study games 
the us chess federation says its necessary to know notation 
to play rated chess in tournaments a written record proves a 
player made the required number of moves within the specified time 
limit 
the system known as algebraic notation is most widely used 
in algebraic notation the ranks are the horizontal rows of 
squares the ranks take numbers 1 to 8 beginning on whites side 
of the board 
the files are the vertical rows of squares they take 
letters a through h beginning on whites left 
thus each square is identified by its file letter and rank 
number 
in the starting position whites queen knight stands on b1 the 
queen on d1 the king on e1 blacks queen knight stands on b8 the 
queen on d8 the king on e8 and so on 
other features of the system follow 
designation of pieces the major pieces are shown by a capital 
letter k for king q for queen r for rook b for bishop and n for 
knight no symbol is used for the pawn 
moves by pieces shown by the letter of the piece except for 
the pawn and the destination square for instance bb5 means the 
bishop moves to square b5 
moves by pawns since only one pawn can move to a given square 
at any time pawn moves are designated only by the name of the 
destination square thus e4 means the pawn on the e file moves to 
e4 
castling it is written as 00 for the kingside and 000 for 
the queenside kingside is the side of the board right half from 
whites point of view left half from blacks on which each 
players king starts the other half is queenside 
captures by pieces a capture is recorded using an x after 
the letter for the capturing piece for instance if whites bishop 
captures the black pawn it is written bxf6 
captures by pawns when a pawn captures something the players 
name the file the pawn was on and the square where it made the 
capture if whites pawn on a g file captured blacks pawn the 
move would be gxf6 if blacks pawn on an f file captured whites 
it would be fxg5 
check the symbol for check is a plus sign 
ambiguity if more than one piece of the same type can move to 
a square the rank number or file letter of the origination square 
is added thus if a rook on d1 were to move to d4 but another 
rook also could move there instead of rd4 the move would be given 
as r1d4 pronounced rook at 1 to d4 if there are black 
knights on c6 and e6 and the one on e6 moves to d4 the move is 
given as ned4 knight at e to d4

just as a few chosen farmers have done for more 
than 1000 years susumu anai on wednesday harvested sacred 
rice for his emperor to offer the gods in a mystical ritual of 
enthronement 
the harvest conducted under heavy security completed the 
gathering of rice that emperor akihito is to offer to the gods of 
shinto japans native religion next month 
but unlike in times of old when japans monarchs were revered 
as living gods and shinto was the national religion questions have 
been raised about the rites constitutionality and whether it 
should be performed 
palace and local government officials looked on silently as 
anai clad in white cotton robes and wearing the type of tall black 
hat worn by religious and court officials centuries ago entered a 
talismanringed paddy and cut several plants to place on a wooden 
altar 
the hourlong ritual on japans southwestern island of kyushu 
followed a similar harvest two weeks ago in akita in the 
northeast by tradition one paddy must be to the west and one to 
the east of kyoto japans former capital 
having the paddy of my ancestors chosen makes me feel both 
honor and the weight of responsibility said yoichiro ito the 
akita farmer whose paddy was used for the rice 
it was rice that i had just grown like the rest ito said in 
a telephone interview as a farmer this is a great honor 
emperor akihito will offer the rice and several other kinds of 
food to the gods in the mystical daijosai or great food offering 
ritual on nov 2223 after his nov 12 coronation 
akihito ascended the throne after his father hirohito died in 
january last year his formal enthronement however had to await a 
oneyear mourning period and the growing of rice for the daijosai 
after communing with the gods in two halls at the tokyo imperial 
palace akihito is to sleep with the spirit of the sun goddess 
amaterasu from whom the imperial line is said to have descended 
the daijosai was largely ignored in the 15th and 17th centuries 
but otherwise has been performed regularly for at least 1200 
years 
because akihito will be the first monarch to be enthroned under 
japans postworld war ii constitution his coronation is under 
particularly close scrutiny 
nearly 1000 people are suing japans conservativeled 
government over plans to provide state funds for the rite which is 
opposed by christian buddhist and intellectual groups 
before japans surrender to the allies in 1945 a nationalistic 
brand of shinto had state backing and was used by the government to 
rally the people behind the war effort 
hirohito renounced the concept of imperial divinity soon after 
the war and a new constitution written mainly by us occupation 
forces banned government backing of shinto or any other religion 
in defending the decision to provide funds officials have 
acknowledged the religious significance of the rite but stated its 
importance as an imperial tradition should take precedence 
in february imperial ritualists selected the location of the 
two sacred paddies by heating turtle shells over charcoal until 
they cracked and then using the cracks to divine where the proper 
paddies would be found 
only the names of the states were announced because radical 
leftist groups who oppose the monarchy have threatened violence 
to disrupt ceremonies related to the coronation 
radicals claimed responsibility for a fire in july that razed a 
shrine in akita and were suspected of setting a fire earlier this 
week in a buidling formerly used as a train station for the 
imperial family but no incidents were reported at either harvest 
ceremony 
ito said he was not told by local agricultural officials that 
his paddy had been chosen until one month before the harvest and 
that the palace had not approached him until one week before the 
rice was to be cut 
the first i heard about it was on the night of aug 23 he 
said it was a very unexpected thing and i was quite shocked

the united nations is sending a human 
rights expert to burma to check on claims of torture and the 
failure to investigate the 1988 killing of thousands of 
prodemocracy demonstrators un officials said wednesday 
the leader of burmas opposition aung san suu kyi has been 
under house arrest for more than a year her national league for 
democracy won a majority of seats in mays parliamentary elections 
but the military government has not yet turned over power 
the entire leadership of the national league for democracy has 
been detained last month the acting head of the opposition party 
his deputy and four regional party leaders were arrested and 
charged with breaking the official secrets act 
the government says it must resolve some challenged election 
results and write a new constitution before stepping down 
the un commission on human rights is sending an investigator 
to burma who will give the genevabased commission a private report 
in february said un spokeswoman nadia younes 
burmas deputy foreign minister u ohn gyaw said that his 
government has agreed to and indeed welcomes the visit to our 
country of prof sadako ogata an independent expert appointed by 
the commission on human rights 
she will shortly be arriving in our country to carry out her 
mandate he said 
questions have been raised in certain quarters concerning the 
restraint placed on certain individuals in my country he added 
legal action has been taken against these persons not for 
their political activities but for their infringement of the 
existing laws of the land he said 
in 1988 government troops fired on prodemocracy demonstrators 
killing thousands of them in rangoon the burmese capital 
amnesty international says that many hundreds perhaps thousands 
of suspected government opponents were detained without charge or 
trial or sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials before 
military tribunals 
at least 100 people have been sentenced to death although it is 
not known if any sentences have been carried out said amnesty 
the government has never investigated the orders to the troops 
to fire on the protesters 
torture and arbitrary executions by soldiers trying to put down 
insurgences were widely reported amnesty said

fired employees have a right to sue if the 
companys grievance procedure does not get them rehired an 
attorney for two michigan workers argued wednesday in the supreme 
court 
the attorney laurence gold asked the court to overturn lower 
court rulings that the workers were bound by the result of the 
inhouse grievance procedure 
but terence v page attorney for the ferndale fastener division 
of ring screw works in the detroit suburb of ferndale mich 
argued that the lower courts ruled correctly since the employees 
contract did not explicitly grant the right to sue 
this court has never allowed people to run the gamut of 
company appeals and then go to court for a second bite of the 
apple page said 
the key question the case raises is whether employees may take 
labor disputes to court when their collective bargaining agreements 
neither grant nor rule out a lawsuit 
ring screw works and its employees have operated under a 
collective bargaining agree since the early 1950s with local 771 of 
the united auto workers union 
the agreement sets out a fourstep grievance procedure for 
settling disputes including outside mediators if agreeable to both 
sides 
if the talks produce deadlock the union could strike and the 
company could lock out the workers the contract says nothing about 
the possibility of lawsuits 
gold said in an interview he was not involved in drafting the 
agreement and did not know why the subject wasnt addressed 
it just looks like it never surfaced as an issue he said 
most union contracts but not all do say whether lawsuits may 
be filed 
in 1985 ring screw works fired arthur groves on the grounds of 
excessive absenteeism and bobby j evans for allegedly falsifying 
company records both tried to get their jobs back through the 
normal grievance procedure but failed 
the company declined to submit to arbitration but the union 
decided not to strike 
the employees then sued claiming the company breached the 
collective bargaining agreement by firing the workers without just 
cause 
the us district court in detroit threw out the suits saying 
the employees could not sue unless there was evidence the union had 
not given them effective representation the workers made no such 
allegation 
a federal appeals court upheld the decision 
gold told the justices he doubted the employees would have 
agreed to the contract if they thought it would prevent them from 
going to court as a last resort 
we believe collective bargaining agreements should not be 
construed to preclude judicial enforcement unless that is clearly 
and unmistakably the parties intent he said 
page said that by providing for strikes and lockouts as a last 
resort the two sides signaled an intent to resolve their disputes 
among themselves without involving the courts 
associate justice byron white expressed skepticism that strikes 
and lockouts are effective means of resolving disputes the winner 
of such showdowns is stronger or more patient but not necessarily 
the correct side he said 
page disagreed saying the value of strikes and lockouts is in 
prodding workers and management to resume negotiations the courts 
proper role is not to settle labor disputes but to act as umpires 
and make sure you play by the rules he said

the united nations is launching a relief 
program this month to feed more than 1 million angolans suffering 
from drought and a debilitating civil war the un coordinator in 
luanda said wednesday 
it is the first time the united nations has gotten clearance to 
distribute food throughout the country from angolas marxist 
government and from the rebel army that has been fighting for 15 
years said un luanda coordinator otto esseien 
the united nations plans to distribute about 60 million in 
food clothing drinking water and vaccines to angola the next six 
months he said 
official estimates of angolans in need of disaster relief vary 
from 500000 by official count to 2 million according to 
international organizations angolas population is 105 million a 
severe drought has affected the country since last year 
aid initiatives have been stymied by government fears that food 
convoys would be used to smuggle arms to the rebels of the national 
union for the total independence of angola 
unita as the rebel force is known by its portuguese acronym 
was concerned the government would block shipments to the areas it 
controls mostly in the southern and eastern parts of the country 
government and rebel delegations met last month in portugal 
with us and soviet observers to negotiate a ceasefire the two 
sides agreed to further peace talks later this month 
both sides have withdrawn their objections to the relief 
deliveries and vowed not to attack aid convoys esseien said 
but he acknowledged the whole operation is costly complex 
and risky the aid shipments will reach angola through the port 
of lobito in the southern province of benguela and through two 
points on the namibian border the convoys will have no military 
escort 
the rebels dominate most of cuando cubango a southeastern 
province bordering namibia where the threat of starvation is said 
to be gravest 
government officials speaking on condition of anonymity say 
more than 30000 people have died of starvation this year in 
angola 
unita has been fighting the sovietbacked government since it 
took power in 1975 after the war of independence with portugal 
the war has left this resourcerich country in a state of ruin 
it has claimed more than 340000 lives left 50000 people maimed 
and hundreds of thousands homeless according to official figures 
the relief program will be one of the largest the united nations 
has undertaken in africa since its aid to hungerstricken ethiopia 
in the early 1980s esseien said 
unrest over food shortages has mounted in luanda the capital 
since the government last month imposed an economic austerity 
package the package replaced angolas currency with a new unit 
the new kwanza devalued it 50 percent and froze most cash in 
circulation 
the government promised to fill official stores with food but 
supplies have been slow to arrive 
tension peaked tuesday when 3000 shipyard workers in luanda 
refused to work all morning to protest the reforms which left them 
without coins and small bank notes for shopping

democracy 
we welcome the german people as a whole back to the 
fraternity of civilized nations exclaimed sen john heinz rpa

the treaty signed in moscow sept 12 by britain france the 
soviet union the united states and east and west germany now goes 
to president bush for his signature it relinquishes all american 
rights and responsibilities over germany and lifts soviet french 
and british controls over the country as well 
a unified germany is something i look at with some concern 
said sen rudy boschwitz rminn who fled berlin during his 
childhood i intend to vote for this resolution nothing should 
stand in its way but a sense of the history of central europe and 
a sense of the history of the world should be stated on the senate 
floor so that germany will remember that we will be watchful 
the millennium has not yet come said sen jesse helms 
rnc echoing several senators statements of concern about the 
peaceful intentions of a unified germany 
sen paul simon dill said he supported the treaty and said

policy against recognizing the soviet annexation of the baltic 
states 
we must now focus our attention and our energy on the 
challenges of the future not the legacy of the past said senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
this treaty is of historic importance he said it marks 
the end of an era it puts behind a century of conflict or 
potential conflict at the center of the earth a century that 
witnessed the ravages of two wars

not exact the price of german sovereignty for german unification 
all freedomloving people of the world have won

on the soviet union to complete the withdrawal of its estimated 
370000 troops from what was east germany by 1994 
us british and french troops will remain in berlin during the 
interim 
in sending the treaty to the senate president bush had said it 
clears the way to achievement of the goal we americans have long

mrs sigmund who died at home had been suffering from a 
recurrence of a cancer that first struck her in the early 1980s 
that cancer a malignant melanoma forced the removal of her left

retire from congress she was again battling cancer 
her death marks the end of a life that was dedicated to 
excellence and compassion florio said she used her many gifts 
to the fullest and in doing so she touched many hearts and made 
her home in princeton as well as this state a better place for 
everyone 
former gov thomas h kean called mrs sigmund a woman of

she proclaimed that her lifelong ambition was to run for congress 
nine years later she was president of the student body at 
manhattanville college in new york where she received a degree in 
governmental studies 
her gubernatorial primary campaign was short on cash but mrs 
sigmund charmed crowds with her wit saying she wanted to be new 
jerseys first governess 
of florio who at the time was a congressman mrs sigmund said 
its always good to have a man around the house lets keep him 
there 
she finished a surprising second in the threecandidate race 
mrs sigmund pushed for social programs including lowincome 
housing and criticized what she said was a lack of planning in 
many of the states corporate park sprawls 
she is survived by her husband paul a professor of latin 
american studies at princeton university and three sons she also 
is survived by a sister cokie roberts a correspondent for national 
public radio and abc news and a brother thomas hale boggs a

252 tons of the concentrate to the iraqi atomic energy commission

jordan is discussing plans to arm and train 
a civil guard to help the army fight any potential israeli attack 
parliament speaker suleiman arar said wednesday 
arar told 3000 demonstrators gathered to protest the monday 
killings of 19 palestinians in israelioccupied east jerusalem that 
prime minister mudar badran has accepted a request from parliament 
to arm a citizens militia 
an official in the prime ministers office said the government 
would meet next tuesday to discuss the implementation of the plan 
yaqoub qirrish a member of parliament said the plan would 
probably involve storing weapons at local police stations for use 
by civilians in emergencies 
moslem fundamentalists as well as leftwing political parties 
and palestinian factions have been asking the government for 20 
years to train and arm citizens as a second line of defense against 
israel 
the groups have expressed increased fears that israel might 
attack jordan and expel palestinians in the occupied west bank to 
jordan to create an alternative palestinian homeland 
palestinians comprise about half of jordans population of 34 
million 
we have met the prime minister and convinced him of the need 
to arm people he agreed and said the decision will take effect in 
three days arar told the protesters outside his parliament 
office 
the government has promised to respond to the armament 
request but it is going to be within limited and narrow limits 
said an official in badrans office who did not elaborate 
our financial situation does not permit us to buy arms for all 
the people of jordan he said citing the countrys 83 billion 
foreign debt 
the official insisting on anonymity said badran and parliament 
agreed to meet tuesday to put forward a plan crystalizing these 
armament ideas he said king hussein might preside over the 
closeddoor meeting 
in 1970 an estimated 20000 palestinian were killed during a 
civil war that pitted king husseins largely bedouin army against 
palestinian factions since the fighting the government has refused 
requests to arm citizens 
israel seized the west bank from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war prompting a mass flight of refugees to jordan

president mikhail s gorbachev said wednesday he 
wants to crack down on the black marketeering that has spread 
rapidly as the soviet leadership hesitates between a centrally 
planned and a market economy 
in his speech at the closing session of a communist party 
central committee meeting gorbachev the party leader as well as 
president signaled a strong assertion of his enhanced executive 
powers 
he also emphasized that economic reform plans would not call for 
a restoration of capitalism indicating a possible step away 
from the radical steps at which central communist authorities have 
balked over the past year 
the party itself retreated further from its vanguard role by 
announcing it was cutting its headquarters staff from 1493 to 536 
people and refraining from making key decisions on national 
economy 
the actions appeared in line with gorbachevs proclaimed 
intention of transferring power to elected legislative and 
executive bodies 
the soviet union seems to be sinking into chaos however the 
party which with 18 million members is by far the largest 
organization in the country is deeply divided over gorbachevs 
policy of perestroika 
the legislature has been unable to agree on a plan to move the 
nation to a market economy two weeks ago it gave gorbachev 
sweeping powers to carry out reforms 
gorbachev told the meeting wednesday that by weeks end he will 
propose to the supreme soviet legislature tough measures that 
will represent a powerful weapon in the hands of law enforcers and 
authorities 
his proclaimed allegiance to the socialist idea and call for 
a war on speculation and black marketeering appeared to reflect a 
conservative backlash against the halting steps authorities have 
taken toward a market economy 
law enforcement officials have complained the state businesses 
that dominate the economy have not been fulfilling their obligatory 
delivery quotas to other state enterprises and that the goods are 
being sold instead on the black market 
gorbachev issued a decree on oct 4 authorizing fines against 
businesses that fail to fulfill state orders his new proposals 
would enforce that decree 
he said a reform package he is assembling will include a mixture 
of state and privately owned businesses and rental of some 
governmentowned properties to entrepreneurs 
i resolutely reject efforts to proclaim the transition to the 
market as a restoration of capitalism he said 
he predicted the people will support his tough measures against 
trade outside the state sphere 
under his supervision a parliamentary commission is trying to 
meld radical and moderate proposals to move toward a market 
economy private industry and decollectivized agriculture 
a party source speaking on condition of anonymity predicted 
gorbachev would take steps to control democracy in order to 
preserve the democratic reforms he has taken 
deputy party chief vladimir ivashko told reporters wednesday the 
400 central committee members were ceding economic responsibility 
to the supreme soviet saying it would be wrong if the plenary 
session of the communist party central committee turned into an 
affiliate of the supreme soviet and started competing on various 
aspects of a particular program our task is to determine political 
aspects of this very difficult process 
the situation has been complicated by shortages of food and 
other basics and by resolutions by nearly all 15 soviet republics 
including the russian federation declaring various forms of 
independence and sovereignty 
if radical economic reforms take place the secretariat staff 
reduction could foreshadow sharp reductions in the number of 
employees in the central ministries which now own nearly all soviet 
businesses 
last year the secretariat let go about 500 workers 
western diplomats and experts have predicted that sudden 
displacement of an elite that once ran the country could add 
momentum to a possible conservative backlash 
the state news agency tass carried excerpts of gorbachevs 
remarks which pravda editor ivan frolov told reporters would be 
carried by the party newspaper friday

space shuttle discovery 
was launched with incorrect instructions for how it should operate 
some of its computer programs a nasa official said wednesday 
the mistake never posed a threat to the shuttle or its fiveman 
crew said milt heflin lead flight director for the mission 
this was serious heflin said but it didnt hurt 
anything 
the crew noticed the error on a computer display screen about 
one hour after discovery was launched saturday from cape canaveral 
fla and quickly corrected it heflin said by phone from johnson 
space center in texas 
even if the crew hadnt discovered the error automatic 
safeguards on discovery would have prevented any problem he added 
nevertheless the national aeronautics and space administration 
will write an anomaly report on the incident and investigate to 
determine the cause of the error and to prevent it from happening 
again heflin said 
discovery landed safely in california on wednesday after a 
fourday flight highlighted by the launch of the ulysses space 
probe which will study the suns polar regions in 1994 and 1995 
heflin said the error was made before launch but was discovered 
when the five astronauts were converting the shuttles five onboard 
computers from launch operations to orbital operations 
to do that the astronauts call up preloaded instructions on 
computer screens after checking the instructions they give a 
command that has each computer follow the instructions 
as planned computers no 3 and 5 were shut off and computers 
no 1 and 2 followed instructions that made them guide navigate 
and control the shuttle 
computer no 4 is used for housekeeping tasks including 
monitoring discoverys propulsion electrical and lifesupport 
systems including temperature and pressure 
but heflin said that when the astronauts called up the 
computerized display showing the instructions for computer no 4 
they found the display screen had been incorrectly loaded with 
instructions intended for computer no 2 
because of builtin safeguards the wrong instructions 
wouldnt have gone anywhere he added 
heflin said the computer program for the shuttles housekeeping 
functions started operating when the astronauts fixed the error 
but would have automatically done so anyway because the wrong 
instructions would have been rejected 
the mistake is considered serious heflin said because if we 
erred in some procedures on the ground why did we not catch it

no more us wheat will go to wartorn sudan 
until the government lets relief move to areas held by rebels the 
us agency for international development said wednesday 
several weeks ago the sudanese government imposed a freeze on 
all food grain within the country said john metelsky an agency 
spokesman this prevented the moving of 35000 tons of relief 
grain already in sudan 
the united states can send no more wheat until relief can move 
freely throughout the country and other obstacles for the 
distribution of relief can be overcome 
relief centers had been bombed and relief flights grounded he 
added last saturday united nations officials in new york said 
sudan had lifted its ban on relief flights to rebels in the 
southern part of the country 
last month us officials accused sudanese president omar 
elbashir of ordering an air raid on a grain barge at the same time 
he was seeking 150 million in additional us food aid 
metelsky said 45000 tons of wheat from the united states 
intended for commercial sale in sudan had been stopped but that 
famine aid had not been cut off he emphasized that the us 
agreement to deliver 20 million worth of wheat had not been 
cancelled 
we are ready to reschedule delivery when sudan meets the 
conditions of the agreement he said 
he noted that the united states had supplied 513 million worth 
of disaster aid to sudan in the year that ended sept 30 
about 5 million people have been hit by drought in the sudan and 
3 to 4 million displaced by civil strife he said un officials 
have predicted that drought could kill a million sudanese 
civil war has afflicted the country much of the time since it 
became independent from joint britishegyptian rule in 1956 
the message we want to convey is that it will be impossible to 
meet sudans needs unless the government makes and carries through 
a firm commitment to facilitate the movement of relief food 
throughout the country including rebelheld areas metelsky 
said

democratic gubernatorial candidate ann 
richards sought wednesday to link republican opponent clayton 
williams to a federal investigation into alleged drug money 
laundering 
williams press secretary gordon hensley accused richards of 
dealing with unfounded rumors allegations and innuendos many of 
which she generated herself she seems to be losing it by 
lashing out at mr williams in an irrational manner 
at a news conference richards cited a houston chronicle report 
that said federal agents were investigating allegations against a 
houston loan broker lloyd g williams jr who also has done 
business with claydesta national bank the midland bank owned by 
the gop nominee 
i think it is incumbent on clayton williams to cooperate with 
the investigation and tell the voters of texas what his 
relationship was with lloyd williams richards said 
hensley said clayton williams has answered questions in a very 
forthright manner he said he does not know the man lloyd 
williams 
lloyd williams no relation to the gop candidate said wednesday 
he had nothing to do with alleged money laundering and that he was 
puzzled by the inquiry he also said he didnt know clayton 
williams and only met him once at a fundraising event last 
spring 
lloyd williams told the chronicle he had acted as an fbi 
operative for more than 10 years why they are now coming at 
me i dont know he said 
richards suggested that the investigation may be why williams 
wont debate her 
i think it is very likely considering the recent press weve 
seen that there are questions he doesnt want to be asked that he 
doesnt want to discuss on television richards said 
hensley rejected the contention thats not even a factor 
clayton williams has said hed be happy to debate ann richards if 
she will go along and pledge to the voters of texas that she will 
refrain from additional negative tv advertising he said 
the chronicle reported this week that lloyd williams primary 
source of income comes from working with auto dealers to arrange 
financing for car buyers with credit problems 
last june lloyd williams began arranging such loans through 
claydesta national the newspaper reported 
the chronicle said investigators are looking into alleged 
laundering of drug proceeds through fallbrook national bank and 
columbia savings both closed last year by federal regulators 
richards said the question remains whether the alleged 
laundering extended to claydesta and may have tainted clayton 
williams campaign money 
laundering is the process in which large amounts of cash 
generated by illegal activities are passed through legitimate 
transactions to make it hard to trace or confiscate banks willing 
to risk taking large cash deposits without asking too many 
questions can profit if they invest or lend the money at higher 
interest rates than they pay the depositors 
richards aide bill cryer said lloyd williams had done some 13 
million worth of business through claydesta the bank was losing 
money until lloyd williams started his loan scheme cryer said 
hensley insisted the richards campaign was engaged in gutter 
politics and there were no improprieties on the part of clayton 
williams 
he knew that claydesta bank was involved in loaning money for 
homes and cars as all banks are hensley said but a banks 
owner isnt always familiar with specific individuals involved 
tangentially in setting up loans hensley said

confusion over president bushs position on 
higher taxes slowed congressional efforts wednesday to start work 
in earnest on a new budget agreement bush showed no inclination to 
clarify matters saying let congress clear it up 
congressional democrats complained that an apparent bush 
rejection of higher taxes on the wealthiest americans a reversal 
of the position he took at his news conference tuesday would make 
it tougher to forge a budget compromise 
but there was no shortage of options as both republicans and 
democrats began floating new versions of tax and spending plans on 
capitol hill 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan and other lawmakers who 
met with the president tuesday night said he had not ruled out the 
tax boost at that private meeting as reported by sen bob 
packwood rore 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that bush 
listened to the gop lawmakers rather than stating a position 
bush on a campaign trip in the south was asked repeatedly 
about the matter but turned away the questions with wisecracks 
he was asked as he jogged during a break in st petersburg 
fla if he would care to clear up the confusion 
confusion he responded 
was he giving up on his longsought capital gains tax rate cut 
the item the democrats supposedly were to trade for his support of 
higher income taxes on rich people 
read my hips he said pointing as he jogged by 
could he clear up his position 
let congress clear it up 
the senate finance committee indefinitely postponed a meeting at 
which it was to discuss a budget package written by its chairman 
texas democrat lloyd bentsen generally in line with the tax trade 
bush endorsed at his news conference 
i had the deal all worked out until the president changes his 
position on taxes said bentsen 
across the capitol the house ways and means committee adopted a 
plan on a voice vote written by its chairman rep dan 
rostenkowski dill the package was similar to the measure 
bentsens panel had readied although it would add restrictions on 
tax deductions available to people earning more than 100000 
annually 
it also would add private planes worth more than 100000 to the 
list of luxury items subject to a new 10 percent tax and place a 
2centpergallon tax on petroleum products excluding homeheating 
oil 
rostenkowskis measure contained neither higher tax rates on the 
rich nor a lower capital gains tax but lawmakers said those items 
might be added by amendments on the house floor 
facing an oct 19 deadline congressional committees must work 
out tax and spending details adding up to a 500 billion reduction 
in the federal deficit over the next five years 
medicare spending is expected to be cut though not as much as 
in the budget package rejected by the house last week and taxes 
are expected to be increased on such consumer items as gasoline 
tobacco and alcohol 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said i had 
hoped for agreement on tax proposals along the lines sen bentsen 
had indicated a intention to offer and the president had 
indicated an intention to accept the presidents reversal of that 
position last evening requires us to reconsider and attempt to 
determine how best to proceed 
dole said that because of the political uproar they were 
causing both a lower capital gains tax and higher rates on the 
wealthy should be excluded from the package 
theyve become sort of a tar baby he said lets get this 
done and get back to deficit reduction 
the confusion was also exposing rifts among republican 
lawmakers 
a group of conservative house republicans put together a 
deficitslashing plan of their own raising the income tax rate on 
the wealthiest americans from 28 to 31 percent it would drop the 
rate on people who are almost as welltodo from 33 percent to 31 
percent and not increase the gasoline tax 
were delighted to have white house input said rep mickey 
edwards rokla the leader of the group were not looking to 
the white house for leadership 
at days end tuesday gop senators had visited bush to tell him 
they opposed raising taxes on the wealthy even if democrats would 
agree to capital gains rate cuts 
he just acquiesced in it packwood told reporters afterward 
i got the impression the president thought that was fine but 
i cant point to a definite fact where he said all right this is 
it said sen john chafee rri 
dole seemed certain he didnt announce his position at all 
he didnt acquiesce 
sen john danforth dmo suggested sometimes people hear 
what they want to hear 
the visit itself was yet another example of republican 
lawmakers unrest concerning proposed budget deals a majority of 
gop house members went against bush last week as that chamber voted 
down the budget agreement worked out by the white house and 
congressional leaders of both parties 
the turmoil on wednesday was hardly encouraging to efforts to 
fill in the details of the 500 billion budget package over the 
next few days and head off a repeat of last weekends government 
shutdown 
bushs reported refusal to raise taxes on the rich garnered 
headlines across the country and struck a nerve among lawmakers 
the wealthiest americans now pay taxes at a 28 percent rate on 
their top dollar people who earn slightly less pay 33 percent 
democrats want to boost the top rate to 33 percent

workers restoring an apartment used by the 
red brigades during the 1970s found what appear to be letters 
written by former premier aldo moro when he was a captive of the 
terrorists police said wednesday 
the former italian premier and president of the christian 
democratic party was slain may 1978 by his kidnappers in probably 
the most spectacular action of the oncefeared leftwing terrorist 
group which has all but disappeared 
the letters two guns and 50000 in cash had been hidden in a 
hole in the wall that police missed when they raided the downtown 
milan apartment and arrested three red brigades members in 1978 
lauro azzolini franco bonisoli and laura mantovani the three 
captured at the via montenevoso hideout were among the terrorists 
who kidnapped moro in rome in march 1978 according to trial 
records 
during his captivity moro sent numerous letters to his party 
his family and leading political figures asking them to negotiate 
an exchange of political prisoners with the red brigades 
several leaders of the gang were in jail at the time 
the government at the time rejected any negotations or prisoner 
swap moro was slain and left in the trunk of a car in rome 
police chief achille serra said 418 sheets of papers including 
letters and photocopies were found in the former red brigades 
hideout along with a pistol a submachine gun 30 detonators and 
the cash 
serra said some of the letters could be attributed to aldo 
moro he didnt elaborate

charlotte rae doesnt turn samuel becketts 
happy days into a joke but in the revival which opened 
wednesday at offbroadways csc theater she does make the play 
much funnier than usual 
rae best known for her work on the television series the 
facts of life has a face with seemingly unlimited expressions 
when it brightens in expectation and then falls in chagrin or 
disappointment it reminds a viewer of the quick unstudied 
responses of childhood one laughs in remembered recognition 
happy days in which the leading character winnie is buried 
to her waist in a big clay mound in act 1 and up to her neck in act 
2 can be seen to mean different things at different viewings 
winnie has a bell for morning wakeup and a bell for night sleep 
in between she isnt striving for major accomplishment she 
reaches into a large purse puts on pink lipstick squeezes a flat 
toothpaste tube and brushes her teeth with a ragged brush the 
woman proclaims that little things such as an occasional grunt from 
her old husband played by bill moor make it a happy day 
in this production a viewer is reminded of a life in 
retirement theres a repetition of the daily rituals that promote 
health and wellbeing and pass time theres also a determined 
effort to keep oneself cheerful 
actresses often play winnie with gallantry rae doesnt stress 
that she plays the situation as humorous and she lets winnie 
appreciate some of the humor remembering her first kiss she 
laughs then ostentatiously pulls back from the laugh her mouth 
turning down 
with her clown face raes expressions allow the audience to see 
even more of the humor of the whole situation than winnie does 
happy days directed here by carey perloff can become 
onedimensional rae does not let that happen she has 
extraordinary range as an actress and extraordinary dynamic range 
making her voice shrill to tender to harsh frivolously high to 
wisely deep mustnt complain so much to be thankful for she 
says briskly curling her voice into a faintly false upbeat tone 
she ends act 1 on a serious note her eyes amazed and shocked 
when she has told herself pray your prayer winnie and finds 
herself unable to pray 
in act 2 moving her mouth and eyes but not swiveling her neck 
winnies smile is now a frozen grin she tells a story and 
frightens herself with it she shows feelings she didnt exhibit in 
act 1 and becomes sarcastic frustrated cynical and rueful more 
importantly it takes a greater effort to cheer herself up 
despite the laughs that rae is able to get out of happy 
days becketts view of the human condition doesnt make a happy 
play

iraqi soldiers have turned to looting food 
from kuwaiti homes and now bar citizens from hospitals restricting 
medical care to military personnel kuwaits ambassador to the 
united states said wednesday 
at the same time iraqis are stripping the invaded country like 
a stolen car removing hospital equipment and even traffic lights 
and shipping them to iraq witnesses said at a hearing of the house 
human rights caucus 
anything which is not nailed down has been taken away as 
well as some things that are nailed down said saud nasir alsabah 
the ambassador public buildings schools and hospitals all have 
been gutted he said 
but of greater concern are continuing human rights abuses in the 
country including torture or summary execution of anyone suspected 
of sympathizing with kuwaits exiled leadership said alsabah and 
others who have fled the emirate 
alsabah also predicted that international sanctions imposed on 
iraq after its aug 2 invasion will fail because saddam husseins 
economy is selfsufficient in food 
i dont believe iraq in the short or long run will be 
adversely affected by the sanctions he told the caucus a loose 
organization of lawmakers interested in human rights issues 
iraqs border with jordan remains open to truck traffic 
thwarting the trade embargo and aircraft still land in amman and 
transfer their cargos to trucks a leak in the new united nations 
air embargo the ambassador said 
sanctions will not bring iraq down to its knees and force it 
out of kuwait he said but alsabah declined to publicly state 
whether he believes the united states should take military action 
saying only you can reach your own conclusions 
he said the embargo was being further undermined by the central 
banks in other countries who are providing credit lines to iraq 
although he declined to name the countries in a public hearing 
saddam husseins policy now is to sit tight to strengthen 
his grip on kuwait and to outlast the patience of the multinational 
forces alsabah said he hopes to break the alliance and he 
believes time is on his side 
at a news conference in cambridge mass iraqs ambassador to 
the united states said allegations of atrocities in kuwait were a 
pack of lies 
the iraqi ambassador mohammed mashat said the united states 
was being influenced by israeli expansionist interests 
meanwhile the leader of the gulf cooperation council a 
grouping of oilrich countries including kuwait and saudi arabia 
appealed to us officials on wednesday to attack saddam before 
kuwait is dismantled 
the united states however wants a political rather than a 
military solution to the crisis said abdulla bishara after meeting 
with undersecretary of defense paul wolfowitz i appealed to the 
administration to speed up its diplomatic activity bishara said 
in an interview 
if diplomacy fails as it probably will the united states and 
its allies should use force against saddam we demand the 
liberation of kuwait at any cost there should be no compromise 
with saddam no reward 
others who have escaped kuwait since the invasion described to 
the caucus horrors they had witnessed 
deborah hadi an american who is married to a kuwaiti said she 
took a cousin who was in labor to a maternity hospital and 
encountered a kuwaiti woman also in labor screaming at the front 
door because she was not allowed to enter 
when she continued to scream they put a bayonet through her 
stomach pinning her to the wall hadi testified 
rep tom lantos dcalif said there are reports that saddam is 
displacing kuwait families and moving iraqi families into their 
homes with the intent of later holding a plebiscite to legitimize 
his occupation of the country 
we all know it might lead to such phony procedures alsabah 
responded

two brothers charged with murdering their 
millionaire parents for the inheritance money wednesday won a 
rehearing on prosecutors attempts to use taped conversations the 
young men had with a psychologist 
the state supreme court ordered the state court of appeal in los 
angeles to review a decision that prosecutors could listen to the 
tapes and use them as evidence against eric and joseph menendez 
the brothers are accused of killing jose menendez 45 and mary 
kitty menendez 44 with a shotgun at their beverly hills mansion 
in order to inherit 14 million eric 19 and joseph 22 maintain 
someone else killed their parents on aug 20 1989 
los angeles superior court judge james albrecht ruled aug 6 
that the prosecution was entitled to recordings of the brothers 
october and november 1989 sessions with psychologist l jerome 
oziel 
conversations between patients and therapists during treatment 
normally are confidential but can be disclosed in some 
circumstances when a patient has threatened another person 
the prosecution argued that the tapes could be released because 
oziel had concluded that the brothers were dangerous and had 
disclosed disclosed the brothers statements to others 
lawyers for the brothers argue that oziels limited disclosures 
had taken care of any danger that existed 
leslie abramson the attorney for erik menendez said the 
supreme court ruling was gratifying 
were not celebrating but we are relieved that we are getting 
a full day in court on this issue she said in los angeles 
the tapes were to have been released to prosecutors and the 
public sept 4 but were sealed last month while the supreme court 
decided whether to grant a new hearing 
psychologists and psychiatrists from as far away as new york had 
called to get information on the ruling because of the cases 
potential impact on the issue of medical privacy abramson said

a white supremacist accused of inciting 
the fatal beating of a black man told jurors wednesday the 10 
million wrongfuldeath lawsuit against him is government 
persecution 
this is a stacked deck theres no doubt about it tom 
metzger who is handling his own defense said during opening 
arguments understand that i am a radical figure and ive had to 
fight the government from the getgo 
metzger 52 of fallbrook calif is the leader of white aryan 
resistance and a former ku klux klan grand dragon 
the lawsuit was filed by engedaw berhanu the uncle of an 
african man slain by neonazi skinheads in november 1988 it 
alleges that metzger incited the slaying by sending a 
representative to portland to preach hate and violence 
it doesnt have that much to do with mr berhanu metzger 
said of the trial this is an insult to my intelligence 
but attorney morris dees of the southern poverty law center in 
montgomery ala told the multnomah county circuit jury evidence 
would link metzger to the slaying of mulugeta seraw 
he described metzger as a pathetic man whose business is 
hate and whose agenda is to set about training these young 
skinheads to go out and do violence 
in america we have the right to hate but we dont have the 
right to hurt dees said were going to ask you to return a 
verdict so big that on the south border of the state of oregon 
theres going to be a wall 10 million high thats going to stop 
tom metzger from coming back to this good state 
dees said a vice president of white aryan resistance met with 
portland skinheads minutes before they attacked seraw 27 of 
ethiopia 
in their meeting with war youth vice president dave mazzella 
the skinheads learned techniques to use in assaulting blacks dees 
said 
the three kenneth mieske kyle brewster and steven strasser 
later pleaded guilty to the attack 
seraw was returning home from a party about the time the meeting 
ended 
the three walked out and stood on the corner about 100 
feet away kyle brewster looked up the street and said hey i see 
a nigger lets go over there and mess with him dees said 
they drove directly up in front of seraw and his friends they 
drove so close these ethiopians could not go around them then they 
did what they had been taught he said 
seraw was beaten to death with a baseball bat which came down 
on his head with such force it just took the whole top of his 
head off 
metzger said his views are radical but he denied advocating 
violence and said his police recor is clean 
they may not like his views but theyve never ever found tom 
metzger going over the line he said 
metzger said he would not call witnesses to refute the 
plaintiffs contention that he commands legions because he has no 
legions 
mieske who admitting beating seraw with a baseball bat 
testified wednesday that mazzella visited him and made a telephone 
call to metzger a month before seraws slaying 
he said he kicked seraw in the head with a pair of steeltoed 
boots he bought from another war member 
mieske also said that he telephoned metzger the day he was 
arrested and spoke to an associate of metzger several times after 
he was imprisoned 
also named as defendants in the lawsuit are metzgers son john 
22 mieske and brewster 
mieske was sentenced to life with a 20year minimum brewster to 
10 to 20 years and strasser who was convicted of beating one of 
the other ethiopians to 20 years

delegates to the governing 
conservative partys annual conference angered by a new ira 
offensive and by government failure to stem rising crime on 
wednesday demanded the return of the death penalty 
but home secretary david waddington instead promised life 
sentences that in the worst cases will mean life 
like prime minister margaret thatcher waddington supports 
capital punishment but is regularly outvoted in parliament 
this government will not flag in its determination to see that 
the monstrous evil of the ira does not prevail waddington told 
the 5000 delegates on the second day of the partys fourday 
conference in this south england resort 
the delegates met under unprecedented security following irish 
republican army attacks this year which included a july 30 car bomb 
that killed legislator ian gow a close political aide of mrs 
thatcher an attempt was foiled last month to kill a government 
minister by planting a bomb at a london conference 
mrs thatcher seated alongside waddington applauded delegates 
who urged restoration of capital punishment and demanded tougher 
anticrime measures 
britain and most other western european nations abolished 
capital punishment in the mid60s attempts to restore it have been 
regularly defeated in the house of commons it is an issue on which 
legislators are allowed to free vote according to conscience 
and not on party lines 
besides the iras bomb and bullet campaign against british rule 
in northern ireland the issue of civil law and order is among the 
most sensitive for the conservatives 
mrs thatcher came to power 11 years ago on a platform that 
included pledges to crack down on crime 
but despite a 60 percent increase in spending on police forces 
crime rates has risen including a 17 percent increase in reported 
crime in the last four months 
riots have also hit british prisons among the most overcrowded 
in europe 
waddington said the government would introduce a 10year maximum 
jail sentence for prison mutiny reduce remissions and parole and 
introduce electronic tagging to keep track of people on parole or 
doing community service sentences

the state resurrected the memory of the 
first black to win a statewide election in kansas by hanging a 
portait of edward p mccabe in the capitol wednesday on the 140th 
anniversary of his birth 
about 500 people gathered in the rotunda as lt gov jack walker 
hung a portrait of mccabe who served as state auditor in 188387 
mccabe is the first black to have his portait among the many 
that hang in the kansas capitol 
i see how far as black americans we have to go said horace 
peterson iii the executive director of the black archives of 
midamerica in kansas city mo were going to keep on erecting 
great paintings and statues to our leaders 
a local activist sonny scroggins organized the ceremony which 
included more than two hours of speeches and music 
mccabe who was born in troy ny settled in northwest kansas 
in 1878 and was prominent in efforts to bring blacks west 
angela bates president of the nicodemus historical society 
said mccabe was a strong man who refused to be daunted by 
prejudice mccabe ran successfully as a republican for auditor in 
1882 then won reelection in 1884 
he later moved to oklahoma and started a movement to persuade 
blacks to move west to make it a black state although the movement 
failed it led to the establishment of several black towns 
including langston okla where historically black langston 
university is located

iraq complained to the united nations on 
wednesday that washington has frozen its bank accounts barred 
special aircraft flights by its foreign minister and restricted 
the movements of iraqi envoys 
iraqi envoy adnan malik did not mention during his appearance 
before the committee on relations with the host county that the 
security council has denounced baghdad for violating international 
law on hostagetaking and for violating the immunity of diplomatic 
compounds 
the us delegate on the committee james wilkinson called the 
complaints misguided and misdirected 
malik said the bush adminstration barred foreign minister tariq 
aziz from flying to new york on his special iraqi airways plane he 
said the flight was needed for security reasons 
wilkinson said us restrictions on iraqi flights stemmed from 
the security councils economic embargo on iraq and occupied 
kuwait he said aziz could have come to new york on any commercial 
flight as did 90 other foreign ministers 
it is ironic that iraqi should cite security threats as a 
reason for special arrangements especially since iraq increasingly 
sponsors terrorist groups and their use of the public media 
wilkinson said 
he said limiting iraqi diplomats to a 25mile radius of new york 
city was appropriate in view of the iraqi governments action not 
to allow the unrestricted travel of foreign nationals in iraq 
baghdad holds hundreds of western hostages at strategic sites as 
human shields to prevent any us attack in iraq 
malik said us freezing of iraqi assets and banks accounts is 
hindering the work of its un mission 
wilkinson said washington would try to work out necessary steps 
so the iraqi mission could continue to function at the united 
nations

whether democracy wins or not this 
months elections will be costly for an economy already weakened by 
higher oil prices analysts and economists say 
the losses to the economy may run into billions of rupees in 
terms of wasteful campaign expenditure and lost business said 
economist hussain mullick 
campaign spending has been estimated at up to 135 billion and 
conducting the elections will cost the government about 15 
million 
elections for the national assembly the lawmaking lower house 
of parliament are scheduled for oct 24 provincial legislatures 
in punjab sindh baluchistan and northwest frontier provinces will 
be chosen three days later 
president ghulam ishaq khan dismissed prime minister benazir 
bhutto and dissolved the national asesembly on aug 6 he accusaed 
ms bhuttos government of plundering the treasury and abusing its 
constitutional and administrative powers during 20 months in 
office 
the 37yearold former prime minister and several of her cabinet 
ministers face charges before special tribunals 
prime minister ghulam mustafa jatois caretaker government 
accuses ms bhutto of allowing 20 billion rupees 900 million in 
bank loans to relatives and friends as political patronage with 
little or no collateral 
it alleges the bhutto government spent 30 million for what 
ishaq khan called horsetrading to insure victory in a 
november 1989 noconfidence vote 
ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party and its main opponent the 
islamic democratic alliance are contending for 217 seats in the 
national assembly and 483 in the provincial legislatures 
you need money to throw all around to win a seat be it money 
from gunrunners heroin barons or smugglers said afzal sindhu 
a leader of her party and a former national assembly member 
he estimated each candidate spent about 114000 in the 1988 
election in addition to money donated by friends and relatives 
most political observers and candidates estimate the cost per 
candidate this time at about 180000 
the campaign can pump an extra 25 billion rupees 115 
million into the economy in less than four weeks and that is a 
lot of money to push prices up in an economy of a trillion 
rupees mullick said 
finance minister sartaj aziz said pakistans annual inflation 
rate was in double digits and independent economists put it at 
more than 15 percent 
factories and farms transport and telecommunications trade and 
industry either halt or slow dramatically when millions of workers 
become preoccupied with rallies and campaigns 
pakistans economy already suffers from the higher oil prices 
caused by the persian gulf crisis 
aziz said pakistan uses 180000 barrels of oil a day 120000 of 
it imported and our oil bill may go up by 900 milllion a 
year 
he said pakistan also was losing 300 million a year from 
pakistanis working in kuwait and iraq and 100 million in trade 
about 85000 pakistanis worked in kuwait and 10000 in iraq 
until the iraqi invasion of the persian gulf emirate on aug 2

fifty years after the first women 
joined switzerlands army some old guard commanders still order 
them to make coffee 
the 3000 women doing military service also risk criticism from 
family and friends and prejudice from employers unwilling to give 
them paid leave for regular refresher training 
brig gen eugenie pollack puts discrimination and male 
chauvinism high on the list of obstacles she has encountered since 
becoming chief of the womens military service last year 
she is a softspoken determined woman who raised eyebrows in 
conservative army circles this summer by marrying her longtime 
companion he is a lawyer who works for environmental causes she 
said in an interview at her headquarters in the swiss capital 
womens reluctance to take the army seriously is more 
significant than the sexist comments and attitudes pollack said 
and blamed it for the persistent shortage of women volunteers 
if the brigadier had her way national service would be 
compulsory for all women in this neutral country with military and 
civilian options 
every woman should have a certain training she said for 
example we should all know how to move into an air raid shelter 
and how to cope in a disaster i do not agree that only men should 
have such education 
female volunteers are committed to 117 days of service four 
weeks of basic training and refresher courses of two or three weeks 
over several years 
basic training for male conscripts in the 625000man reserve 
force lasts 17 weeks and overall service totals one year 
women do not receive weapons training but the government is 
expected to allow them to carry pistols in the near future for 
selfdefense 
pollack said she favors arming women on a voluntary basis and 
estimated 50 percent to 70 percent of her volunteers would choose 
to carry weapons 
she added however that women never would be used in combat 
because it would be politically unacceptable and there is no 
need 
in the past women soldiers have been confined to medical 
clerical or transport jobs but now they can work in the 
intelligence service as trainers of rescue dogs and as chaplains 
male commanders do not always let women fill positions for which 
they are trained pollack said 
we have had real problems with some commanders who merely sent 
women to make coffee she explained and described the attitude 
as reflective of society in general switzerland did not give women 
the vote until 1971 
much can be learned from other armies the brigadier said and 
she has invited participants from 11 countries to a threeday 
seminar on integrating women into the armed forces they include 
the united states canada australia sweden and poland 
only about 100 women have volunteered for the army this year 
she said leaving it nearly 1000 short of the goal of 3900 
the eastwest thaw has caused interest to flag and the persian 
gulf crisis seems too distant to have an impact pollack said and 
added the irony of the whole business is that you almost have to 
wish for a crisis to attract enough people 
switzerland first accepted women into the army in 1940 when it 
was a neutral island in germanoccupied europe and there always 
has been a shortage of volunteers 
if the commander had her way the womens corps ultimately would 
disappear because being utopian i would like to see women so 
integrated that a special female army no longer exists

a white line across the highway is all 
that officially comes between wendover utah and wendover nev 
but the neighboring towns are worlds apart divided by the 
contrary philosophies of hellraising nevada and godfearing utah 
one wendover an improbable cluster of watered lawns and neon 
lights shouting in the lonely sagebrush outside the state line 
casino a 64foot cowboy named wendover will waves his 
mechanical arms beckoning travelers to a gamblers paradise 
the travelers most of them from utah where gambling is 
illegal drop enough dollars in wendovers six casinos to make the 
town blossom like a desert rose despite wendovers isolation salt 
lake city is 120 miles east reno 400 miles west business is 
booming population is growing and new homes are sprouting around 
the towns new 18hole golf course 
theres little new in utahs wendover its chief attraction is 
an abandoned world war ii air base with broken windows and empty 
echoing hangars junk cars rust along gravel side streets and 
paint peels from dilapidated cottages when the wind howls in from 
the salt flats the town seems ready to shrivel up and blow away 
like a tumbleweed 
were just like a ghetto said richard dixon a grocer on 
the utah side its the difference between east berlin and west 
berlin only the wall has neer gone down between wendover utah 
and wendover nevada 
since 1988 dixon and other businessmen in wendover utah pop 
1300 have tried to tear down that wall by lobbying for a local 
exemption from utahs constitutional ban on gambling 
without gambling they say wendover will die since 1985 
nearly 200 families have moved to a more prosperous life just over 
the white line dixon said in the nevada wendover pop 2000 
schools are betterfunded and there are no state taxes on food or 
personal income 
its easy to see why a town living in the shadow of wendover 
will would want a cut of the gambling take but its also no 
surprise that the rest of utah is cool to the idea 
utah and nevada share a 340mile border an arid climate 
political conservatism and some great differences 
some disparities can be traced to their frontier heritage to 
hardbitten miners who settled nevada in 1859 lusting after the 
mother lode to mormons who arrived in utah in 1847 seeking to 
practice their religion in peace 
nevada celebrates the reckless frontier spirit in casinos and 
bars that never close nowait weddings help produce the highest 
marriage rate and highest divorce rate in the country 
prostitution is legal in 11 counties 
family oriented utah channels its sexual energies differently 
though no less vigorously it has the nations highest birth rate 
lowest abortion rate largest median family size and youngest 
population 
nevadans say they have more fun but utahns live longer average 
life expectancy in utah is 757 years or three years longer than 
in nevada an insurance company recently ranked the health of 
states based on levels of smoking accidents violent crime and 
disease the results were hardly surprising utah was no 1 for 
healthy lifestyles nevada was 49th 
religion lies at the root of the differences utah has more 
churchgoers per capita than any state while nevada ranks 45th 
more than twothirds of utah residents belong to the church of 
jesus christ of latterday saints commonly known as the mormon 
church 
mormon theology considers gambling a forbidden vice and the 
state constitution follows suit banning all games of chance 
involving money 
it is a gauge of wendover businessmens determination then 
that their gambling proposal went as far as it did they won 
supporting resolutions from city and county authorities in 1988 and 
even found two state senators both mormons to back a 
constitutional amendment 
that woke up utahs mormondominated political scene the 
churchowned deseret news utahs secondlargest newspaper 
editorialized against the amendment and early last year the bill 
was unanimously tabled into oblivion by the senate business and 
labor committee 
its a matter of principle says state sen richard tempest 
who opposed the amendment nevada has whorehouses do we need 
whorehouses to make a living somewhere you have to draw the line 
i dont like gambling its demeaning and degrading to the human 
spirit 
wendover businessmen promise to keep fighting they point at the 
utah cars streaming across the notorious white line and say 
somebody in utah obviously likes to gamble 
but even some gaming utahns believe that gambling like a 
slotmachine handle is best kept at arms length 
id just as soon not have gambling in utah said mrs b 
johnson 65 of ogden she was clutching a cupful of nickels in 
front of a pokerslot machine in the state line casino i just 
feel gambling brings a different element into the state 
mrs johnson wouldnt give her full name i probably shouldnt 
be here she said im a mormon glancing around at others 
feeding the slots she added but then i think a lot of them are 
mormons too

you can stamp your feet if you want you can cry 
sulk even hold your breath until you turn blue it wont help 
there is a nanny shortage afoot and no amount of parental 
petulance will ensure that you can hire a nursemaid for your 
children 
we cant possibly fill the demand said cathie robertson 
president of the international nanny association and a 
nannytraining instructor at grossmont community college near san 
diego 
for each trained nanny 25 to 250 families want one said 
robertson whose group fields 15 queries daily from parents seeking 
more than a sitter or day care people are more willing to pay 
for excellent child care she said 
they certainly do pay 
terri eurich founder of the national academy of nannies inc in 
denver last month placed one graduate with a connecticut family 
that pays 1400 monthly plus major medical coverage including 
vacation provisions also travel opportunities those jobs are 
out there eurich said 
nationally average pay ranges from 200 to 300 weekly for 
trained livein nannies hired by couples who between the two of 
them earn at least 80000 yearly said donna dixon an associate 
dean at the moraine park technical college in fond du lac wis 
nanny educators and placementagency operators are hardly 
surprised by the dearth of trained nannies more than 32 million 
mothers work outside their homes now the us labor department 
predicts that by 1995 80 percent of women ages 22 to 44 will work 
outside the home representing almost 15 million preschoolers 
there are lots of babies there are older wealthier 
dualincome people having babies said eric miller editor of 
research alert a long island magazine devoted to spotting and 
analyzing trends 
yuppies as theyve aged buy service almost more than 
anything else they dont like the paltry child care available 
its a recipe for a nanny miller said 
susan elsea a suburban detroit sales executive for american 
express considered a daycare center when she was pregnant she 
envisioned wondering are her diapers changed is she by herself 
in a corner by the time carolyn was born seven months ago she 
had decided to hire a nanny 
day care absolutely not i just will not take her out of the 
house on those cold blustery mornings i wanted her here she 
said fortunately she said she earns enough to pay for it 
elsea used an agency rather than a classified ad to find her 
nanny the finders fee is well worth it the 1000 was a drop 
in the bucket time is money we couldnt have come up with her on 
our own she said 
agencies and schools private and public stress that nannies 
must be trained a textbook is being written now for the fledgling 
field and groups like the international nanny association are 
pushing standardized courses 
training varies from 100hour courses to twoyear college 
associate degrees but experts agree that nannies must know 
nutrition childcare basics like when babies switch to solid 
foods psychological and physical development safety telephone 
and table etiquette and how to handle emergencies 
robertson said there are at least 68 nanny programs at community 
colleges like hers and 20 of them are just a year old there are 
at least 15 private schools like eurichs 
at least 75000 nannies have been placed in homes nationwide by 
schools or agencies not including illegal aliens or nannies 
without any classroom or practical experience robertson said 
i would insist on training but some families get so desperate 
that they dont said dixon whose state school has a oneyear 
program and also offers an associates degree 
linda hiceguastella quit law school to open her nanny network 
inc placement agency four years ago her applicant screening 
includes reference and police checks 
weve come up with drunk driving and disorderly conduct but 
nothing more serious you have to screen she said her clients 
tend to be people worried about abuse or neglect at daycare 
centers where wages are low turnover is high and training is often 
minimal 
nannies placed by her metro detroit agency earn at least 200 
weekly to live in and up to 450 if they have a nursing 
background 
women can have a wife too they dont have to choose between 
their families and jobs hiceguastella said 
the cost isnt necessarily much higher than a daycare center 
a year of fullday preschool costs 4200 per child and up to 
9000 or more for infants according to a general accounting 
office survey of 1988 average costs the most recent available for 
infant care or nannies shared by families the cost is comparable 
said barbara willer of the national association for the education 
of the young a washington dc advocacy and professional 
association for childcare workers 
barbara taylor president of the national association for family 
day care in washington dc makes the case for organized day 
care children in day care get structure and the stimulation of 
playmates she said 
daycare workers generally earn less than livein nannies whose 
compensation includes room and board yet people arent flooding 
the field 
eurich says some prospective nannies are worried that theyll 
end up being maids or by publicized cases in which childcare 
workers are accused of abusing their charges 
carol emrich the coordinator of delta colleges nanny training 
program receives about 100 inquiries monthly from families seeking 
nannies the twosemester program has eight students although she 
expects more in the winter term its just real important to 
stress the opportunities 
its hard to recruit students we have 30 to 40 jobs for 
every graduate dixon said

alongside a chapel at louisville presbyterian theological 
seminary in kentucky stands a brass sculpture of a crowing rooster 
an ancient christian symbol of warning some say it is relevant 
for todays mainline protestantism 
a repeated cocks crow signaled the apostle peters denial of 
the arrested jesus before his crucifixion and a new study says 
the roosters poignant cry of caution now echoes in some church 
conditions 
but the study also detected signs of surmounting the 
difficulties 
the situation in historic protestantism is described as 
decline malaise division and demise a weakening that has 
toppled the old mainline churches from holding sway over american 
culture 
involved is an epochal change in american religion that has 
occurred during the 20th century says the first volume of the 
planned sevenvolume study of the problem and responses to it 
oldline denominations presbyterians episcopalians 
methodists congregationalists now united church disciples and 
american baptists are said to have been displaced religiously 
and culturally to a significant degree 
all have suffered severe membership losses and serious 
theological strains while all have shifted emphasis from 
devotionalism toward social justice and struggled over 
institutional organization sapping energies the study says 
it adds that nevertheless they remain influential voices in 
the spectrum of american religion and retain an enduring vitality 
in the face of a massive reconfiguration of american religious 
life 
more than 60 researchers at seminaries colleges and 
universities throughout the country took part in the study 
financed by the lilly endowment it focused on the presbyterian 
church usa as a case study 
the developments within one tradition american 
presbyterianism are mirrored in other denominations as well 
says the first volume the presbyterian predicament published 
by westminsterjohn knox press 
the rev john m mulder louisville presbyterian theological 
seminary president who heads the project said it was the most 
extensive research ever into any protestant body 
he said the study turned up developing processes in mainstream 
religious life that make this one of the most interesting and 
exciting periods in american religious history 
were at a point where the church is beginning to define 
itself in a new situation in which it has new competitors both in 
society and in nonchristian alternative religions mulder said 
its very clear that american culture no longer supports and 
reinforces the church but in facing new competitors it is finding 
new resources the church is being called back to its basic 
identity to what it believes to the difference it makes in 
lives 
terming this an important turning point for the churches he 
added in an interview today churches have lost their cultural 
recognition they now are being challenged to be the church to be 
christian to define their identity over against secularity to be 
religious in the best sense of the word 
the sevenvolume series is being publishes under the general 
title of the presbyterian presence the 20th century 
experience two more volumes the mainstream protestant 
decline and the confessional mosaic are coming out this 
fall two additional volumes are due next spring and two next fall 
mulder said the findings point both to the causes of the 
languishing of mainline denominations and to means for overcoming 
it he said the findings also indicate such a recovery is under 
way 
theres a resurgence of the moderate center the huge majority 
of church people who are tired of denominational policy being 
determined by extreme groups left or right he said 
this is dispelling past factional polarization that has 
afflicted churches retrieving vitality expended in those fights 
he said the people who have remained silent in controvery have 
finally begun to assert themselves 
he cited these other positive signs 
new church development a lack of which has been a major 
factor in a quarter century of denominational decline is being 
reemphasized with a surge of new congregations in the old 
protestant bodies 
baby boomers born in the decade after world war ii are 
beginning to return to church participation after generally 
shunning it in the 1970s and early 1980s 
congregations that suffered severe declines particularly in 
urban areas are showing a kind of elasticity and vitality that 
almost defies destruction congregations once considered dead are 
coming back to life 
mulder said mainstream denominations also now see a need for 
each to forge a theological identity that is persuasive and 
distinctive that characterizes each denominations special 
contributions to the larger christian family 
they are all committed to ecumenism he said they recognize 
the fuller christian totality he added but now are clarifying 
their particular vision and insights in it rather than 
diluting those values

when immigrant sam krichinsky arrived in 
baltimore in 1914 he says at the opening of the movie avalon 
it was the most beautiful place he had ever seen 
if audiences share krichinskys memory they can thank allen 
daviau as the films director of photography daviau was charged 
with transforming director barry levinsons rich script into 
equally evocative images 
perhaps no scene in avalon reveals daviaus artistry more 
than that first scene in which krichinsky armin muellerstahl 
portraying levinson as a young man lands in electric park a 1914 
exposition recreated for the film by production designer norman 
reynolds 
as the first reel unspools something looks off as krichinsky 
moves through electric park decorated with 18000 lights his body 
movements are slightly jumpy and the colors overly rich he walks 
at normal speed and yet it is clear we are not watching his actual 
arrival it is instead krichinskys recollection of it 
this is a very abstract stylized idealized memory hes 
having of brilliant lights said daviau whose cinematography won 
academy award nominations for steven spielbergs et the 
extraterrestrial the color purple and empire of the 
sun 
one of the things barry said was we have to find a way to 
distance the past sequences from the present of 1948 daviau 
said to avoid cinematic cliches he declined to use filtration or 
sepia toning 
what daviau pronounced daveeow did instead was film at 18 
frames per second as opposed to the standard 24 frames he then 
stretchprinted the film using every other frame twice 
its missing a third of the information that our 24frameper 
second mind is used to seeing and its being restored in an 
artificial way daviau said weve seen stretch printing in 
silent films for many many years the difference is you havent 
seen it in color 
daviau first used the technique making a bank commercial several 
years ago he still alternates between commercials and feature 
films 
its the best mixture in the world he said because 
commercials keep you busy they keep you in practice they make you 
a lot of money and you meet a lot of directors who are on their way 
to doing pictures 
working in commercials allows you to be choosy about what 
movies you do what i was really looking to do happened when 
avalon came along 
i really am fascinated with the 40s daviau said i got 
to deal with a period that i remember quite well 
the movie spans 50 years detailing the lives of the 
krinchinskys levinsons famil and the world in which they 
live 
daviau started as a still photographer photo lab technician and 
theatrical lighting designer during the mid1960s he photographed 
rock promotional films with jimi hendrix aretha franklin and the 
who other feature credits include the falcon and the snowman 
and defending your life in 1988 the american society of 
cinematographers voted him best cinematographer in feature films 
levinson and spielberg both are visual directors daviau said 
but have different styles 
steven is much more interested in the design of the shot the 
graphics are very very important to him daviau said barry is 
a visual director by all means but its a different emphasis he 
loves the compositions 
the cinematographers job is a curious one 
its really a case of choosing to make your presence known 
and you pick a look for a film and then youre out to make that 
look fit daviau said 
there are certain things that general audiences may notice 
about photography that are not the things you do a lot of times 
were credited with scenery the things we really do are things 
that people rarely notice most of our work is lighting color 
texture 
one of the greatest things that you do in cinematography is 
you guide the audiencess eye to where it should be youre giving 
emphasis where its desired 
i dont think i would ever want to be known as every film i 
have looking the same or somebody saying oh daviau did that for 
sure id much rather shape the look to the individual film 
in avalon he said certain details demanded to be examined 
closely 
i looked at armin muellerstahls face and in a second i saw 
those eyes this is one of the most remarkable faces ive ever been 
given to photograph 
for the thanksgiving dinner scenes in avalon daviau bathed 
the interiors with warm comfortable light pouring in from outside 
windows is cold blue light 
near the films end sam krichinsky settles into a chair to read 
a newspaper a few seconds later when he arises hes aged 10 
years the framing of both shots is identical there is no jump in 
the image even though the two scenes were done more than a week 
apart so seamless is the transition that some in the audience 
dont notice for several moments that krichinskys grown old 
and that for daviau is photography at its best

the national theater has imported talent 
from as far away as new zealand to get norwegians to stop ignoring 
henrik ibsen their countrys greatest writer 
theater director stein winge said this months first 
international ibsen festival was a belated attempt to make up for 
norways scandalous neglect of the 19thcentury dramatist 
actors from new zealand ireland england sweden and norway 
have been helping to reconcile norwegians with ibsen 84 years 
after the playwrights death in oslo 
there is nothing new in norwegians neglecting ibsen often 
called modern theaters most influential figure 
his early plays were ignored or met with such hostility in 
norway that ibsen fled to italy and then germany for 27 years of 
selfimposed exile 
ibsen didnt especially like norway said winge but he 
wrote in norwegian and said that to understand his work one had to 
know his countrys severe beauty isolation and introspective 
people 
ibsens socially realistic dramas examined such themes as 
venereal disease alcoholism incest and insanity all shocking and 
forbidden topics in his era 
when sigmund freud the austrian father of psychoanalysis was a 
9yearold ibsen was already exploring the human psyche in plays 
later described as psychoanalysis in dramatic form 
shock has faded into apathy among modern norways liberal 
easygoing people said winge oslos aftenposten nwwspaper said 
most consider reading ibsen a drudgery to endure as a student 
his fans a minority are so awed by ibsen that they are timid 
in exploring his work said winge we have made him a museum 
piece we experience what we expect ibsen to be we need to 
be presented with what other cultures see in our poet to open the 
door and get him out of the museum 
a recent festival brought outsiders to oslos national theater 
to help blow off the dust from ibsen 
lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis who wants to lead his 
baltic republic out of the soviet union attended the opening 
ceremony and said i connect ibsens name his work and his ideas 
with strong thoughts of freedom which have reached a deep meaning 
for people in lithuania 
winge said he did not know why the national theater waited 
nearly a century to arrange the festival the theater claims to be 
ibsens home because he invested in it and attended its 1899 
opening 
it should have been done a long time ago said winge his 
first act after being appointed theater director in january was to 
establish the annual festival 
modern norwegians may have been shocked by new zealands 
downstage theater setting the 1890 play hedda gabler in the 
1950s one oslo newspaper grumbled at a harley davidson motorcycle 
being on the stage 
purists probably raised their eyebrows over peer gynt being 
performed as a ballet by londons abc dance company or by masked 
actors in a fairy tale version by the kalmar sweden city theater 
winge however was pleased by such experimentation i think 
ibsen would have approved he said 
the theater groups performed 11 plays many in english from 
ibsens three periods 
from his first period the festival offered a performance of the 
1866 tragedy brand and three versions of peer gynt from 
1867 
his bestknown period when ibsen rebelled against social 
conventions was illustrated at the festival with such plays as 
hedda gabler a dolls house and ghosts performed by 
the belfast northern irelands lyric theater 
finally he wrote strongly symbolic plays 
ever since a dolls house had its breakthrough on the 
european stage ibsen was more successful abroad than at home 
its a tradition we have maintained until the present said 
vigdis ystad a norwegian university professor and ibsen scholar 
ystad attending a twoday ibsen symposium said many foreigners 
know more than norwegians about ibsens ability to illustrate 
lifes big issues through simple human conflicts 
we owe it to our writer country and the world to be the best 
in ibsen research said ystad in a newspaper interview she urged 
parliament to fund an ibsen center in norway 
ibsens star may finally be rising in norway oslo newspapers 
extensively covered the festival and demand for tickets surprised 
even winge who added extra shows 
its late but not too late wrote an aftenposten 
editorialist about the surge in interest excuse me if i find it 
a little strange to put it mildly that any country suddenly 
discovers ibsen especially when that country just happens to be 
ibsens homeland

flying back to washington to vote on the 
budget mess a democratic senator told the fellow in the next seat 
who he was 
bad move 
sen david pryor of arkansas told colleagues that the passenger 
beside him asked whether he worked for the government i said 
as a matter of fact i do im a united states senator he said 
well if you dont mind i dont want to sit with you 
and changed seats 
a democratic house member is said to have mused aloud that hes 
glad to be unopposed in next months election because hed probably 
vote for the challenger if there was one 
that sort of gallows political humor reflects the bleak outlook 
as congress struggles into the next round on the budget a nowin 
issue there and at the white house 
the governments trying to deal in days with decisions that were 
supposed to be made months ago lawmakers need to figure out how to 
trim the annual deficit by 500 billion over five years 
sen william l armstrong rcolo said people wont see anyone 
in congress as a hero they will all look like jerks 
and theres no guarantee that the process wont grind into 
another shutdownthegovernment deadline with spending authority 
extended only until oct 19 that date does come with an extra 
inducement its the day congress had hoped to adjourn for the 
year 
the settlement that avoided the fullscale shutdown threatened 
for tuesday merely enables us to get to first base said sen 
george j mitchell dmaine the majority leader it doesnt cut 
the deficit by one dollar 
it does set guidelines 40 billion in revenues and spending 
cuts to reduce a steadily increasing deficit anticipated this year 
500 billion over five years and assigns the regular house and 
senate committees to draft specific legislation to meet those 
goals 
those were the overall numbers of the budget agreement president 
bush tried to push through congress with late but intense personal 
lobbying the house rejected that plan last friday in the process 
conservative house republicans rebelled over the tax increases that 
were part of the settlement 
that could happen next time too since taxes will be central to 
the new plan 
bush acknowledged that his 1988 campaign vow against new taxes 
makes it more difficult for people who echoed him to vote for 
an increase now but he said he doesnt regret his pledge because 
what i do is take a look at at the situation at the time see the 
changed economics and say ive got to got to you know go 
forward here 
hed already conceded that his tax philosophy runs out of gas 
in terms of votes in congress 
as vice president then as candidate and president bush held 
the nonewtaxes line for nearly 10 years he spent 10 minutes on 
national television on oct 2 trying to turn it around and get the 
first budget deal approved 
tell your congressmen and senators you support this 
deficitreduction agreement he urged the voters by most 
accounts the message that got back to congress was the opposite 
although bush maintains that the agreement had wide support from 
the american people 
but nobody bothered in advance to prepare the voters who pay the 
taxes and use the programs for the surprise package that was 
supposed to hit on both sides of that ledger the problem was 
turned over to congressional leaders and administration negotiators 
to be handled in protracted secret bargaining the result was a 
lastminute proposition with no constituency in congress let alone 
the country 
in part that was a product of political maneuvering in whch 
the democratic congress and the republican white house each tried 
to get the other to go first in publicly advocating steps that were 
bound to be unpopular with voters 
bush had said people worried about the election impact of the 
first budget deal should recall the tax increases that were enacted 
when ronald reagan was president 
and there wasnt a political fallout because i think the 
country understands when the president concludes that a deal is 
necessary bush said they incline to give him the benefit of 
the doubt 
sometimes

the bad news about the simpsons is that 
despite a big buildup by fox broadcasting tonights secondseason 
premiere doesnt reveal who killed laura palmer 
the good news such can happen in matt groenings quirky cartoon 
series about a typical american family full of love overbite a 
proudly underachieving son named bart and a dog named santas 
little helper 
tonights premiere however has young bart finally realizing 
the terrible cost of not studying he could be held back in the 
fourth grade for another year and maybe even for life 
this will please teachers everywhere particularly those at 
three elementary schools who last april banned the wearing of 
barts underachiever and proud of it tshirt 
despite such pecksniffs the simpsons was a hit in its first 
year a series whose bugeyed sweetly weirdo clan took the 
tradition of shows like father knows best made it bluecollar 
and put it somewhere in the neighborhood of reality 
with bart baying dont have a cow man the show rose as 
high as fourth in the nielsens its success ignited a megabuck 
merchandising blitz of simpsons products but that was when it was 
on sunday nights 
then fox in a burst of dim that had groening groaning shifted 
the show this season to thursday opposite nbcs toprated the 
cosby show fox also delayed the secondseason premiere until 
tonight 
all this has put the simpsons so low in the nielsens that 
divers must be dispatched each each week to get the results many 
analysts feel that this will continue no matter what groening amp 
co do 
they could be wrong it may just be that frequent attacks of 
warmth decency and goodness by nbcs family huxtable finally have 
taken their toll on viewers there is such a thing as too much 
warmth decency and goodness 
but it also helps that the simpsons is off to a fine 
restart tonight with a very funny show written by david m stern 
it brilliantly brings back those chilling childhood memories of 
facing a major test at school when ones mind is in the state of 
nobody home 
and bless its heart the show also takes some quick sly digs at 
the pervasive mindnumbing influence of video games and television 
on kids 
barts class crisis begins when hes called on to give a book 
report on treasure island as is his custom he hasnt read it 
as is his custom he tries to wing it glancing at the book cover 
for inspiration 
its about these pirates pirates with patches over their eyes 
and green birds on their shoulders 
but of course he winds up at the blackboard writing i will 
not fake my way through life 100 times 
berated by the teacher facing a major history test the next 
day he knows he must study but first to the video arcade there 
he plays your basic video game where a tyke shoots a granny who 
wants to kiss him 
at home well just a bit of tv before dinner 
he sits with his smart younger sister lisa and maggie their 
pacifiersucking infant sister watching a violent catchasesmouse 
cartoon let them eat scratchy 
they chortle when one character winds up in a guillotine he 
shrugs his shoulders and with good reason 
after dinner homer the patriarch insists that bart join him 
watching a gorilla movie on tv after that bart finally tries to 
study about the pilgrims but he falls asleep over his book 
marge americas only mother with a blue beevive hairdo notes 
that her son tries so hard but why she asks does he keep failing 
in school 
just a little dim i guess homer says 
poor bart faces even more woes including twin meanies on the 
school bus the next day he seeks their help in cramming for the 
coming test they advise him that the pilgrims came to america on 
the spirit of st louis 
but in time he does learn one of lifes most valuable lessons 
that dimness can be overcome sort of 
the simpsons is different all right and not just because 
coming episodes feature a tony bennett appearance danny devito as 
the voice of homers separatedatbirth brother and homer getting 
a male secretary voice by torch song trilogy author harvey 
fierstein who proves to be gay 
the show also has good writing attention to lifes any 
oddities and craftsmanship that may not be enough to beat the 
cos but its worth a look

when you compare the relative attractions of 
money market mutual funds big can be beautiful 
to any student of the art of mutualfund investing that may 
sound like a surprising idea 
traditionally in arenas such as the stock market small funds 
are often considered to have an edge on their larger competitors 
in part because they can be more flexible and maneuverable 
but in the 400 billionplus moneyfund business which engages 
in a different battle waged in a different marketplace analysts 
who have studied the subject say just the opposite principle 
applies 
large money funds have a tendency to yield more to their 
shareholders than small money funds says the investment advisory 
letter income amp safety published by the institute for econometric 
research in fort lauderdale fla 
income amp safety arrived at this conclusion by examining the 
field of money funds it monitors grouped by where they ranked in 
the services system for forecasting fund yields 
the funds with aboveaverage yield forecasts it turned out had 
an average of 37 billion in assets those with average yield 
forecasts 23 billion and those with belowaverage yield 
forecasts 600 million 
in other words pointed out norman fosback the institutes 
president taxable money funds with aboveaverage yields had on 
average an asset base six times as large as funds with 
belowaverage yields 
fosback cited several reasons why this correlation appeared to 
be more than coincidental 
first large funds experience some economies of scale in their 
daytoday operating expenses as these relatively fixed costs are 
spread over a larger asset base expenses per dollar of assets 
fall and lower expense ratios equal higher yields 
secondly fosback said sponsors of large funds tend to collect 
smaller percentages from the funds assets for their annual 
management fees in part he observes this reflects the fact 
that many management companies scale back their fees as fund size 
increases 
third very large money funds can sometimes obtain slightly 
better returns by purchasing commercial paper shortterm ious 
issued by corporations and other entities and certificates of 
deposit in huge denominations 
finally fosback added the market for money funds is 
quite efficient investors are attracted to funds with superior 
yields and avoid those with belowaverage returns this helps the 
bestyielding funds to grow still larger 
fosback and other observers caution that size should not be the 
first criterion used in trying to gauge any funds merits 
the prime questions are usually relative yield and safety as 
reflected in the kinds and maturities of investments a fund has in 
its portfolio 
there also may be special factors to consider as well the 
dreyfus worldwide dollar money market fund for instance has used 
an aggressive marketing strategy to help promote its rapid rise to 
the ranks of both the biggest and highestyielding funds 
for more than a year and a half since the fund was established 
the sponsoring dreyfus corp has picked up all the funds operating 
expenses and collected no management fee 
it has promised that it will continue to forgo the management 
fee until at least next june 30 but starting oct 1 it began 
charging part of the operating costs to the fund 
but with all those caveats fosback observes size does 
matter 
a stock mutual fund can in theory at least fall victim to its 
own success attracting more money than it can put to work in the 
strategies that have won it acclaim 
by contrast in a moneymarket fund popularity apparently can be 
a blessing rather than a bane

if uncle sams economic statistics had been kept 
properly there would have been no budget crisis and fewer strains 
between congress and the white house 
that view of the budget crisis is one you probably havent heard 
before even though you may have been one of those who swore that 
everything that could have been said had been said and that you 
didnt want to hear anymore 
albert sindlinger is an economic researcher who gathers his own 
information and produces his own analyses for corporate academic 
and governmental clients his data comes from telephone calls his 
staffers make to households 
those calls he says reveal to him that there are probably two 
million fewer workers in the american economy than are being 
reported officially by the bureau of labor statistics 
he claims the disparity lies in errors in blss methodology 
including its revisions and its tendency to count one person 
working two jobs as two people working two jobs with two full 
incomes rather than perhaps one and onequarter 
but thats for the statisticians to argue about and 
sindlingers argument consumes 49 typewritten pages of 
compilations charts and graphs 
more to the point his budget commentary is that if the bls 
removed those two million workers it would reduce gross national 
product and show the economy to be in recession as he has had it 
for nearly a year 
while the bls has found the economy to be weakening it still 
has it skirting recession due largely to those extra workers 
worker wages and salaries he says account for nearly half of 
gross national product 
if bls figures agreed with his concludes sindlinger 
implementation of the grammrudmanhollings act would have been 
automatically deferred there being a provision to that effect when 
two straight nearrecession quarters occur 
he concludes with a truthful gnp the act would have been 
scrapped and the current charade of blamemanship would not be 
amplifying the growing voter revolt 
economist roger brinner has another somewhat offbeat comment 
about the budget scene oddly he says congress hasnt yet caught 
on to the revenue opportunities presented by the strategic 
petroleum reserve 
brinner whose analysis are made for drimcgrawhill inc part 
of standard amp poors corp reasons that by selling perhaps 200 
million barrels of the reserve at 3750 a barrel could close 75 
billion of the budget deficit 
then he continues if war doesnt break out the reserves 
could be later rebuilt at twothirds the selling price since he 
believes prices will fall if peace is achieved 
i cynically expected this to be part of the 50 billion 
firstyear budget adjustment he says instead he says 
negotiators took a more difficult course of scaledowns program 
cuts tax increases and other maneuvers 
another commentary to j marc wheat of the citizens for a sound 
economy foundation a nonprofit research group the budget 
negotiators somehow missed the point that americans wanted spending 
cut rather than taxes raised 
more dollars flow into federal coffers than ever before 
says wheat the foundations director of tax and budget policy and 
he has the figures to prove it 
he points out that revenue to the federal government has grown 
every year since 1983 increasing from 6006 billion to an 
estimated 1073 trillion in 1990 a 79 percent increase 
that being so he concludes that overspending rather than lack 
of revenue has caused our deficit problems and that congress 
should not be trusted to cut spending in future years

jews came last week as national islamic representatives joined a 
major interfaith operation religion in american life 
dawud assad president of the council of mosques of the united 
states said that in taking the step we look forward to some 
good cooperation in the future with our brothers and sisters 
were at a new stage at which we cease to be a religion on the 
margins but a religion of american people related to american 
life said gutbi e ahmed director of the moslem world league 
were now ready to interact with the rest of american people 
particularly in relation to its religious communities 
leaders of other faiths protestant roman catholic eastern 
orthodox and jewish welcomed the moslem entry into the 
organization which works to encourage regular worship and 
community service 
this is an historic moment for rial and i daresay for 
america said rabbi joseph b glaser chairman of the group and 
executive vice president of the central conference of american 
rabbis 
it could be a turning point for our nation he added we 
have broken a major barrier and who knows the beneficial effect 
may well ripple to other shores 
religion in american life was founded in 1949 and initially 
involved only protestant denominations it later included roman 
catholicism making it interchristian and subsequently enlisted 
jews making it a interreligious 
now with the entry of islam we become a holy organization 
glaser said holiness is inclusive it knows not fences 
holiness is trust and is caring beyond ones parochial boundaries 
holiness is knowing that we are all gods children and in 
knowing that knowing god 
moslems previously have been involved in interfaith theological 
dialogues but not in interreligious activity on a national basis 
we had not been willing to join before because we would be 
drowned assad said but he said moslems now have 
organizational maturity and strength to facilitate interreligious 
cooperation 
the council assad heads includes 195 mosques worshipping 
centers in most major cities he said there also are now more than 
1000 moslem community organizations some worshipping in basements 
or other makeshift places 
noting islamic roots in judaism and christianity he said we 
who work together all are of the abrahamic faith 
he said moslem scriptures the koran demands dialogue with 
people of the book the bible meaning jews and christians we 
also believe in all the book the prophets the gospel he said 
no islamic membership count has been made in this country but 
estimates generally put the figure between 4 million and 6 milion 
although some estimates range considerably above that 
the rev nicholas b van dyck a presbyterian and president of 
religion in american life said starting islamic participation 
shows what may be news to many americans that most moslems 
support interfaith cooperation 
the group coordinates interfaith research and public information 
activities including provision of worship directories in hotels 
it also works to increase weekly worship backed by public service 
advertising campaigns 
the current drive under the slogan invite a friend 
involves projects in thousands of congregations 
for years islam in this country has been regarded a foreign 
religion and consequently moslem immigrants learned to live in 
their own substructure ahmed said 
however he said the taking root in america of indigenous black 
moslems of which he is one and the presence of a second 
generation of younger americanborn moslems opened the way for 
cooperation with other faiths 
the big difference is that we have had a wall around our lives 
in a moslem ghetto and now we see we are part of this society 
that our future is here he said this has never been faced by 
moslems before 
the islamic representatives said most american moslems support 
international efforts to get iraqi forces out of kuwait but hope 
for a peaceful solution 
they also understand the presence of western forces in saudi 
arabia but some have misgivings about it ahmed said in 
summarizing conclusions of 700 moslem leaders last month at a 
continental council of mosques 
both ahmed and assad also said there had been few signs of 
antagonism toward american moslems as a result of the middle east 
crisis 
not much of it only a few incidents assad said 
ahmed noted a few scrawls on mosques and a few telephone hate 
calls but he added compared to the antimoslem feelings stirred 
by irans holding of american hostages in 1979 this time it has 
been minimal

huberts used to sell caviar and truffles its 
tables were set with fish forks and fish spoons waiters wore 
designer uniforms and ties and jackets were required of the 
customers 
a dinner for two cost 165 
today there is no caviar and the fish forks are stored away 
waiters wear their own slacks and shirts there are more tables 
pushed closer together 
the price for two is about 100 a hefty sum for most people 
but a dramatic cut for the upper east side restaurant 
i felt we were in a vastly changing world and that i needed to 
keep up says len allison chefowner of huberts 
this is the year of rude awakenings for restaurant owners in new 
york city the economic downturn triggered by the stock market 
crash in 1987 has hit them hard especially proprietors of 
secondtier luxury establishments 
at creditcard restaurants sales were down 15 percent to 20 
percent in june compared to the same month last year while 
nationally they dropped between 12 percent and 14 percent says 
restaurant consultant michael whiteman 
a gallup poll for the national restaurant association in 
washington dc showed 22 percent of adults ate lunch out on any 
given day in july compared with 30 percent in june the polls were 
of 1000 people and had a margin of error of 35 points expensive 
restaurants are hardest hit 
people will trade down for lunch said george rice a 
spokesman for consumer reports on eating share trends which tracks 
restaurant industry data its chez pauls to bennigans and 
bennigans to dennys and then dennys to mcdonalds thats been 
going on for a few years and it will accelerate 
restaurant owners from san francisco los angeles detroit and 
boston say they too are adjusting to a newly costconscious 
dining public but their outlook is brighter than that of their new 
york city counterparts 
i think we are going through the same thing but its harder 
in new york said jasper white chefowner of jaspers an 
upscale restaurant in an old molasses warehouse in boston 
new york city is bigger it is tied more closely to the fortunes 
of the financial community and it has more restaurants competing 
for survival he said moreover the dining public has more to 
revolt against in the big apple since restaurant prices are by far 
the highest in the country 
the average price of dinner for one in new york city three 
courses one drink and tip in the 20 most popular restaurants 
according the popular zagat survey of eateries is 61 in los 
angeles the city with the second most expensive meal prices the 
average is 43 
i think the restaurants that were popular in the 80s had a 
shiny armor says adam tihany coowner of remi a new and 
popular trattoria in midtown manhattan where dinner costs about 
35 a person 
the places that are successful in the 1990s he says will be 
run by people who truly care and turn out a product that 
gives you value for what you are spending 
indeed midpriced bistros where the atmosphere is casual and 
the food is simple are thriving in new york city says tim zagat 
publisher of the surveys 
people want to eat well because they are used to that but they 
dont want to spend as much time or as much money as they used 
to says jimmy schmidt chefowner of the rattlesnake club in 
detroit 
his successful restaurant on the detroit river features 
midwestern cooking in a light airy environment filled with 
contemporary art about 80 percent of the main courses are priced 
under 20 
picey restaurants that do not have fourstar reputations for 
food and service are revamping their menus and decor to appeal to 
the spontaneous costconscious diner 
the glitterati used to pack melrose a basement restaurant in 
new yorks greenwich village where they could dine on small 
portions of california food served on big white plates for 55 a 
person but when the trend setters moved on melrose emptied 
owner lee friedman realized neighborhood people werent going 
to come in for three slices of rarecharred tuna for 25 
earlier this year he renamed melrose the barrow street bistro 
cut prices about 40 percent toned down the austere decor and 
changed the menu to include heartier bistro cooking business has 
picked up and more than half of friedmans customers are from the 
neighborhood 
in boston jaspers was hit hard by the stock market crash 
overnight it lost many of its expense account clients 
we reacted immediately says white the chefowner the menu 
was expanded to include lowerpriced items like fish cakes and pot 
roasts and the waiters donned white aprons instead of tuxedos the 
average dinner price for one person dropped from 70 to 55 
joyce goldstein a san francisco chef says she expects to see 
fewer luxury restaurants in the coming years but not fewer people 
eating out 
its not uh oh were in a recession lets start cooking 
little chicken things at home says the owner of square one 
where dinner averages 35 a person and the atmosphere is warm and 
friendly 
people are working just as hard twice as hard as ever before 
the last thing we need after work is to go to the supermarket and 
cook

for connie bishop a simple thing like 
changing lanes is enough to jolt her back to oct 17 1989 
i still dont like those little reflector bumps someone sold 
to the highway you hear that thump thump when you change lanes 
and you try to catch your breath bishop said 
she was driving on the upper tier of highway 880s cypress 
structure when it crumbled in the earthquake killing 42 people 
she felt what she thought was a flat tire then saw the freeway 
sway and a huge section yards in front of her sink to the bottom 
deck 
uninjured bishop put her experience to work 
it was probably the biggest rush of adrenaline ive had in 37 
years she recalled i kind of went into my old staff nurse 
mode after about a minute or two i was checking out peoples 
injuries its second nature 
a year after the shaking stopped bishop says shes still 
feeling the emotional aftershocks of the 15second temblor 
quake nightmares and sudden bursts of fear of the really big one 
persist for many northern californians those who experienced the 
quakes worst devastation still may suffer severe ongoing stress 
and anger 
as the chief administrator of alta batesherrick hospitals 
mental health ward bishop is familiar with postquake symptoms as 
a survivor shes experienced the sleeplessness and anxiety 
herself 
for many she predicts the anniversary will bring out 
unresolved grief 
we celebrate anniversaries marriages divorces they are 
rituals around significant life events bishop said people also 
have negative anniversary date reactions they feel bad just 
like if youve lost a parent or a loved one its a loss 
in neighborhoods near the cypress structure where residents 
scaled the crumbled concrete to save victims heightened fear and 
anger linger 
there are lots of crises marital relationship 
childparent many have been trying to get back on track with their 
lives and havent been able to said ken davis a psychologist 
with the west oakland mental health center 
robert raven majors 37 was among the rescuers he still 
dreams about a woman who died as he promised her she would be all 
right 
i kept telling her youll be all right the side of her 
head was crushed and she was mumbling her legs were broken i 
recall her saying am i gonna be ok i said yes and then she 
died he said 
a teetotaler before the disaster majors began drinking and took 
time off work as a security guard a fear of bridges he overcame 
before the quake is back stronger than ever and he pulls his van 
to the side before crossing the san franciscooakland bay bridge 
majors a raggae guitarist never regained full use of his 
thumb broken as he saved the life of a woman dangling from the 
smoldering ruin 25 feet above the ground 
the black smoke was choking her i said youre gonna die if 
you stay there ill try to break your fall he said the woman 
fell on majors who flagged down a motorist to take her to the 
hospital 
pat and john abduljammie live with daily reminders of the quake 
their west oakland home just a few yards from what used to be 
the cypress structure never was fully repaired a sewer line 
remains broken and one of the showers doesnt work the house 
cracked and broken leans to the east because the quake jolted it 
off its foundation 
the couple tries to cope with the anger they feel at what they 
view as government neglect damage to their home was estimated at 
35000 to 40000 and they received 10080 in grants 
the house shakes incessantly because it is not anchored and 
john abduljammie wonders how he will be able to afford to fix it 
its as if youve been accosted by someone they took your 
money robbed you at gunpoint said abduljammie an artist who 
works at home he too was one of the west oakland rescuers 
the feeling i have when it shakes is anger this is shaking 
from the past earthquake its just constant his wife said

last years earthquake resulted in 
dozens of new california laws including a temporary sales tax hike 
expected to raise 800 million and a statewide home quake insurance 
program 
in a special session called after the oct 17 quake and in this 
years regular session the legislature passed a total of 102 
quakerelated bills far more than in previous years 
the new laws are spreading the quakes effects into the states 
distant corners far from the san andreas fault 
all california consumers have been paying an extra quartercent 
sales tax since dec 1 and all 65 million of the states 
homeowners even those living on absolute bedrock next year will 
begin paying 12 to 60 extra annually for home insurance to cover 
potential quake damage 
the tax increase raises the states 6 percent sales tax for a 
13month period from dec 1 1989 through dec 31 1990 
the money raised will be added to the state earthquake fund 
used for state and local costs such as the disaster response and 
the repair of state buildings highways and roads said cindy katz 
spokeswoman for the state department of finance 
the quake insurance bill creates a state insurance fund that 
will pay the first 15000 of residential damage caused by an 
earthquake all homeowners will pay a yearly surcharge of 12 to 
60 depending on the risk where they live beginning next july 1 
one finding of the quake was that most homeowners didnt have 
quake insurance because premiums and deductibles usually 10 
percent of the insured value were too high most of the 25000 
homes damaged by the quake suffered less than 15000 damage less 
than most deductibles the new program would cover such damage and 
pay the deductible for homeowners who choose to buy full earthquake 
insurance 
also passed were 
a set of bills creating an 80 million statewide program to 
inspect all publicly owned bridges for seismic safety and fix them 
by dec 31 1991 
a pair of bills establishing an emergency fasttrack claims 
process for families of people killed in the collapse of the 
interstate 880 cypress structure and the san franciscooakland bay 
bridge the bills provided 25000 to 50000 for claims with a 
maximum of 200000 per family 
two quakerelated measures to be put before voters this year 
in june voters approved 300 million in bonds to be used to 
rebuild or repair seismic problems in state and local government 
buildings 
voters in november will decide on proposition 127 which would 
allow property owners to make seismic repairs or improvements 
without having the property reassessed for higher property tax 
rates

united airlines pilots say theyll keep pushing 
for employee ownership but theyre making contract talks their top 
priority after ual corps board rejected their latest buyout bid 
were not about to stop buying the airline said james 
hanson a spokesman for the united chapter of the air line pilots 
association 
uniteds flight attendants and mechanics also are committed to 
employee ownership of the nations biggest airline said gerald 
greenwald chairman of the threeunion group that mounted the 
acquisition attempt 
but until the groups advisers evaluate their options i dont 
think you even assume there will be another bid said hank 
krakowski a spokesman for the buyout group 
uals board of directors rejected the labor bid tuesday marking 
the fourth failed takeover of the chicagobased company in 3 
years the last previous attempt which also involved the pilots 
collapsed almost one year ago 
tuesday was the deadline for employees to arrange financing for 
a 201pershare 438 billion offer that the board accepted in 
principle in april 
despite a lack of bank financing the buyout group presented the 
board with two offers both were rejected 
ual said it wants to reach new contracts quickly with the unions 
and will proceed with plans to place a large aircraft order it had 
postponed at the labor groups request 
the rejection stirred speculation that uals largest 
shareholder coniston partners would revive an effort to oust 
uals board and senior management including chairman stephen m 
wolf coniston said it was exploring its options 
uals stock fell 4 a share tuesday to 88 on the new york stock 
exchange 
the union workers representing about twothirds of uals 71000 
employees are working under expired contracts 
were going to knuckle down and work on contract negotiations 
full steam krakowski said 
greenwalds statement said the labor proposals which include 
employee concessions would remain on the table briefly he did not 
return telephone calls to elaborate 
the pilots who launched their first acquisition effort in 1987 
vowed last month to confront uals management with everything up to 
and including a strike if the board rejected the latest offer 
in a statement the three unions said tuesday they would 
pursue all means necessary to gain substantial improvements in 
wages and benefits 
greenwald said the buyout group presented two proposals a 447 
billion offer for 205 a share including 70 in cash and 135 in 
securities and a 443 billion offer for 203 a share with no cash 
component 
ual said it would proceed with plans to place an aircraft order 
that wolf said in the spring would be the largest ever placed for 
widebodied jetliners 
in july the board bowed to employees request to postpone the 
aircraft purchase until the buyout effort was resolved 
this is a time of unique opportunity to continue to build 
united airlines wolf said in a statement 
ual said it had asked the national mediation board to resume 
expedited mediation immediately in hopes of reaching labor pacts 
with the pilots whose contract expired in april 1988 and the 
flight attendants whose contract expired in november 1987 
the company said it also was prepared to resume negotiations 
with the machinists union whose contract with ual expired in 
november

a tentative agreement to give teachers a 55 
percent raise and new york citys worsening economy prompted a 
major bond rating agency to begin reviewing the citys ability to 
repay debt 
the move by standard amp poors corp tuesday to put the citys 13 
billion in outstanding general obligation bonds on credit watch 
means the agency could decide to downgrade the debt such a move 
would force the city to pay higher yields to investors who demand 
higher returns for the risk 
sampp stopped short of lowering the citys rating of aminus but 
said it sees a need to revise the citys financial plan and to 
evaluate its payroll burden in line with the realities of a 
slipping economy 
im confident we are going to satisfy them that we are in 
control mayor david dinkins said we have a plan we are going 
to meet that gap 
the mayor has projected a 14 billion budget deficit for the 
next year 
the city is not on the verge of an economic disaster state 
comptroller edward regan said its a cyclical downturn with an 
erosion of revenue but that can be handled the problem is that 
this years budget was too large to begin with 
regan said there is plenty of room for dinkins to cut the 28 
billion budget for the fiscal year that began july 1 starting with 
some 8500 new city hires built into the budget 
an arating from sampp means the agency believes the city has a 
strong ability to pay interest and principal on the bonds although 
that ability is more susceptible to economic downswings a plus or 
minus sign on a rating shows its relative standing within the 
catagory 
the next step lower is bbb which signifies that adverse 
conditions make it more likely the city will have trouble paying 
interest and principal 
the other major rating agency moodys investors service does 
not have the citys rating under formal review managing director 
jeffrey rizzo said 
gov mario cuomo who was in new york city on tuesday said the 
city does not face a replay of the fiscal crisis of 1975 because 
mechanisms created then will prevent such a slide now 
saving the city from bankruptcy in 1975 wasnt done by sending 
them money cuomo said it was done by giving them a mechanism 
called mac municipal assistance corporation and guidance through 
the financial control board 
those are still in place and the market knows that cuomo 
said

six oil giants plan to spend 11 
billion boosting oil production in prudhoe bay may cost some alaska 
oil workers their jobs as the companies consolidate the work 
executives said 
british petroleum co atlantic richfield co exxon corp 
phillips petroleum co mobil corp and chevron corp announced an 
agreement tuesday to build and install a huge centralized natural 
gas handling facility to help boost declining oil production at 
prudhoe bay the nations largest oil field arco will operate the 
facility 
the project expected to be completed by 1995 would increase 
oil production by 100000 barrels a day company officials said it 
will add an estimated 330 million to 450 million barrels of oil to 
reserves at the field they said 
bp and arco the two operating partners at prudhoe bay also 
agreed to reduce overlapping services including staff and contract 
jobs on the north slope and in anchorage by the end of 1991 
the number of jobs cut wont be known until next year officials 
said but they promised a gradual process 
bp and arco together employ about 4600 workers at prudhoe bay 
at a time of american concern about longterm oil supplies 
this project will make a welcome contribution and shows alaskas 
potential to add significant domestic reserves bp chairman 
robert horton and arco chairman lodwrick m cook said in a prepared 
statement 
the oil companies announcement follows resolution of their 
longstanding disputes over how much natural gas is available at the 
wells and who owns it said julian darley president of bp 
exploration alaska inc 
prudhoe bay accounts for roughly 20 percent of domestic oil 
production the field began producing in 1977 and in 1988 reached 
its peak at 16 million barrels a day 
the oilfields production has started to decline however 
production now averages 14 million barrels a day said arco 
spokesman albert greenstein in los angeles average 1990 production 
will be about 135 million barrels a day he said 
bp exploration alaska inc a 50 percent owner in the field 
estimates production will decline 10 percent to 12 percent annually 
through the end of the century as the oilfield ages oil coming 
from its wells is mixed with increasing amounts of natural gas and 
water officials said 
the new facility would allow producers to separate gas from oil 
and reinject the gas into the wells reinjection increases pressure 
which increases oil flow 
dubbed ghx2 the new gas expansion project will go on line 
in two stages the first huge gashandling module will be shipped 
by barge to prudhoe bay in 1993 a second module will follow in 
1994 officials said 
last summer the companies began installing the first major gas 
facility expansion ghx1 it is set to go on line later this year 
and will boost daily gas handling capacity from the current 38 
billion cubic feet to 52 billion cubic feet 
after the new modules begin operation in 1995 gas handling 
capacity is expected to increase to 75 billion cubic feet per day 
arco alaska spokeswoman susan andrews said the project will 
create a significant number of new jobs mostly short and 
mediumterm construction jobs but that it was too early to nail 
down local employment figures

junk bond financier michael milken probably 
wont get a chance to face his main accuser ivan boesky before 
sentencing 
federal prosecutors said tuesday they do not plan to call the 
inside trader to testify against milken at a presentencing 
hearing 
assistant us attorney john carroll also said the government 
was dropping one of four alleged illegal transactions against 
milken on which it planned to present evidence and testimony at the 
planned twoweek hearing 
the move not to include boesky in the unusual hearing scheduled 
to begin thursday was not a great surprise boesky was the main 
source of information against milken but also was susceptible to 
attack from defense lawyers 
milken has pleaded guilty to six felony counts and has agreed to 
pay 600 million in penalties in connection with the biggest 
government probe of wall street fraud he faces up to 28 years in 
prison when sentenced by us district judge kimba wood 
sentencing was delayed for the hearing into uncharged 
allegations against milken raised by the government in its lengthy 
presentencing memorandum wood has said the hearing is designed to 
shed light on milkens character 
in a telephone conference with the judge and milkens attorneys 
carroll said the government was unlikely to call boesky to the 
witness stand but they did not rule out the possibility 
altogether he said 
carroll also said to save time the government was dropping from 
its presentation an inside trading allegation involving milken and 
boesky in securities of mgmua entertainment co 
boesky also was a central player in two of the other 
transactions being aired stock manipulation charges in wickes 
cos securities in 1985 and a web of alleged wrongdoing in the 1985 
takeover of storer communications inc the third alleges insider 
trading in caesars world inc securities in 1983 
the caesars and storer transactions involve new charges against 
milken not contained in the governments original 98count 
indictment last year or earlier securities and exchange commission 
charges 
wood has given each side a total of 20 hours to present 
eestimony and crossexamine witnesses at the hearing the burden of 
proof on the government is lower than at a trial though 
boesky who was sentenced to three years in prison and paid 100 
million in penalties to settle insider trading charges is widely 
reviled on wall street and would have given milken attorney arthur 
liman a broad target to discredit 
boesky was not regarded as a successful witness when he 
testified earlier this year against former stock speculator john a 
mulheren jr boesky was perceived as combative on the stand and was 
forced to admit a litany of serious lawbreaking 
instead carroll said the governments first three witnesses on 
the wickes transaction would be former boesky head trader michael 
davidoff and former drexel employees cary maultasch and peter 
gardiner who worked under milken in drexels beverly hills 
calif highyield bond department 
carroll said the wickes testimony would be followed by testimony 
on storer and then caesars the prosecutor also disclosed that 
former drexel trader james dahl and mutual fund manager prescott 
crocker were among about 10 planned witnesses on the caesars deal 
the witnesses for the storer transactions were not disclosed 
prosecutors last week gave defense lawyers a list of 17 possible 
witnesses and wood has ordered the government to say in what order 
it would call them to help the defense prepare its case the 
witness list also includes former drexel chairman frederick joseph 
liman indicated during the conference call that milken would be 
present at the hearing in manhattan federal court

ncr corp a company known for electronic cash 
registers and automated teller machines has launched a software 
system that marks a sharp departure from its traditional sales 
strongholds analysts said 
the cooperation software unveiled tuesday at a glitzy press 
conference in manhattans theater district employs visual 
onscreen aids and other features to let users obtain information 
from data bases route documents and talk electronically with other 
employees 
the announcement comes three weeks after the company said it 
would replace its entire computer line with industrystandard 
machines that all could communicate with each other based on the 
open system the new software launch is designed to help a 
companys computer users communicate with each other even if they 
are working on nonncr computers 
nobody can call ncr dull anymore said ncr chairman and ceo 
charles e exley jr at the press conference as he slipped on a 
pair of bright red sunglasses outfitted with flashing lights 
the fifth largest us computer maker based in dayton ohio 
dominates the slowgrowing banking and retailautomation markets 
but is considered a runnerup in mainstream business computers the 
new software targets all types of companies from 50 employees and 
up 
what youre seeing is ncr coming out of their shell with this 
product said bob vautrain senior research analyst at gartner 
group inc theyre trying to take an obscure 6 billion company 
from the midwest and take it into generalpurpose computing 
relying on hewlettpackard cos new wave visual computer 
technology cooperation is the first software product released 
under ncrs new open computing architecture 
the product unveiled at the luntfontanne theatre was backed 
by an extravagant stage show of colorful lights screens aglow with 
changing images of the product in use and a demonstration by two 
computer operators using the software product at actual onstage 
work stations 
the extravaganza was intended to build excitement among software 
manufacturers and encourage them to write programs that can run on 
the ncr system analysts said 
now that you have this great interface you have to get 
software manufacturers to write for it said vautrain i think 
theres a possibility it will happen 
exley said that cooperation is far more comprehensive than 
equivalent systems on the market with the ability to integrate 
thousands of standard software packages 
there is nothing announced at this point much less in the 
form of product anywhere as near as comprehensive exley said 
in an interview following the announcement 
the software modules range from 17002500 per user for a 
24user company but the total cost of operating the system when 
the workstations are included comes to 1000012000 per user 
exley said noting that the cost for a 100station company would 
total 1 million 
the first release of cooperation is scheduled for next month 
the product is expected to be more generally available in march 
ncr is backing the launch of its open system products with a 12 
million advertising campaign starting with an ad in wednesdays 
wall street journal ncr officials said other ads will appear in 
industry trade publications 
next week ncr is expected to elaborate how companies can employ 
ncrs new software

mgmua settled a 200 million shareholders 
lawsuit for 35 million and the troubled entertainment firm said 
it would file suit against insurers who it said forced mgmua into 
the settlement 
the settlement was forced on the company by a bad faith 
settlement by its insurers attorney terry christensen said 
tuesday he represents billionaire kirk kerkorian the sole 
defendant in the class action suit 
the action charged that kerkorians purchase of united artists 
from turner broadcasting in 1986 robbed shareholders of profits in 
the deal turner got the mgm and rko warner film libraries 
the suit alleged kerkorian the controlling stockholder 
undervalued united artists when he sold mgmua entertainment to 
turner then bought back ua 
mgmua was sold for 15 billion while kerkorian bought back ua 
for 470 million 
the suit claimed kerkorian failed to get the highest possible 
price for the mgmua stock kerkorian retained uas film library 
which includes such perennial stock as the rocky and james 
bond movies 
christensen claimed that the bad faith actions were taken by 
harbor insurance co forum insurance co associated international 
insurance co and national union fire insurance co late calls 
made to the insurers los angeles offices rang unanswered 
mgmua is suing to recover the 35 million settlement amount 
plus punitive damages christensen said 
although we steadfastly deny any wrongdoing on mgmuas part 
we were compelled to reach this settlement christensen said 
it is outrageous that any insurance company would take such 
actions without a clients knowledge and consent and in total 
disregard of its interests he said their attempts to 
partially settle the suit completely undermined our efforts to 
defend it 
classaction attorney michael hennigan said the settlement was 
given preliminary approval tuesday final approval is expected nov 
19 
he said the money will be divided among thousands who held 
mgmua stock between 1985 and 1986

chinese leaders are cautiously planning a partial 
return to collective farming in hopes of raising productivity 
according to an official newspaper report wednesday 
ten years after land was distributed to individual farming 
households communist party and government officials recently 
decided that household contracted lands should be redistributed 
and production conducted under a unified plan the 
englishlanguage china daily said 
chinas reformist leaders dismantled the commune system a decade 
ago allowing the rural economy to return to a family farming 
system that allowed farmers to sell some crops on the free market 
as a result grain production jumped by onethird and rural incomes 
tripled 
but that growth has stagnated chinas farmable land is 
shrinking annually because of industrial development and plots 
worked by individual farmers averaging 15 acres are too small 
for efficient mechanized farming 
at the recent national meeting party and government officials 
decided that conglomerates in charge of supply production and 
sales would be established to make largescale mechanized farming 
possible the china daily reported 
it did not say what incentives farmers would have to join the 
conglomerates or give details about how the conglomerates would be 
set up 
supporters of such a system have carefully avoided calling the 
collectives communes which evoke unpleasant memories of 
extreme poverty and the leaderships leftist mistakes 
aware that the change is likely to be unpopular among chinas 80 
million peasant population officials stressed the household 
contract system was not being abandoned rather it would be 
incorporated into a twotier rural economy along with the 
collective sector 
redistribution will be done with the consent of the majority of 
local farmers the report said 
calls have been heard for several years for a return to 
largescale farming experts say the family farmer who brought 
prosperity to many rural areas has outlived his usefulness and must 
make way for largescale mechanized farming

the supreme court has boosted a bid by the 
nations seven regional telephone companies to enter the 
multibillion dollar industry of providing electronic information 
services to homes and businesses 
the court without comment rejected an appeal tuesday aimed at 
making it harder for the companies to enter the developing 
industry 
the underlying issue is whether the companies socalled baby 
bells should be allowed to use their phone lines to sell such 
information as stock market quotes and electronic yellow pages 
with homeshopping and classified advertising 
the us circuit court of appeals here handed the baby bells a 
crucial victory in april 
the appeals court threw out part of a 1987 ruling by us 
district court judge harold greene who has overseen the breakup of 
the atampt phone monopoly for more than a decade 
the appeals court said greene was too strict in barring the 
regional companies from selling the information services it sent 
the case back to him with instructions to use a more lenient test 
whether lifting the ban would be in the public interest 
asking the supreme court for help was a coalition of consumer 
groups longdistance phone companies equipment manufacturers 
dataprocessing businesses and newspapers that want to enter the 
athome information market 
the coalition including the american newspaper publishers 
association said the appeals court ruling could restore the 
bottleneck that once blocked competition to ma bell 
the appeals court ruling jeopardizes the vigorous economic 
growth spawned by the breakup of atampt in 1984 the coalition said 
but the phone companies said their opponents are trying to kill 
legitimate competition and that most americans will be slow in 
getting information services unless the baby bells participate 
the bush administration sided with the phone companies in urging 
the supreme court to leave the appeals court ruling undisturbed 
the justice department defended the publicinterest standard in the 
appeals court decision and said any high court review now would be 
premature 
greenes 1987 decision loosened the information services 
restrictions somewhat to let phone companies set up local numbers 
that customers could call to connect to many different computer 
data bases but it upheld the core restriction that the phone 
companies can convey only other parties data but not originate 
data themselves 
the phone companies also have been backing legislation in 
congress to remove greens authority and many of the restrictions 
he imposed 
the case is mci communications vs us 909

dollars and stashed 5 billion at home under the mattress and 
shipped perhaps 10 times that amount out of the country 
runs on the austral introduced in mid1985 at a value of 120 
apiece became common as speculators relentlessly bid against it by 
buying dollars the central bank almost went broke in early 1989 
trying to prop up the national currency 
inflation and devaluation knocked out the peso in 1970 the peso 
ley in 1983 and the peso argentino two years later they also and 
have put the austral on the ropes 
the money supply is a tiny 4 percent of gross domestic product 
partly because no one wants the austral its exchange value vs the 
dollar fell to the current 5700to1 from a rate of 17to1 in 
early 1989 
a big banknote then was 100 australs the biggest today 
500000 
central bank president javier gonzalez fraga admits the 
majority of argentines have their savings in dollars 
president carlos menem bowed to reality when he took office 15 
months ago he removed exchange controls and authorized savings 
accounts certificates of deposit and bonds in dollars 
concerned about inflations effect on investment and relative 
prices the government now is considering offering mortgages loans 
and checking accounts in dollars 
car dealers raised eyebrows earlier this year when they refused 
to accept payment in australs which were losing value by the hour 
now prices on the grain exchange are quoted in dollars so are 
hamburgers and sodas by a street vendor at constitution station 
commuters can buy one of each for a buck 
all my suppliers bill me for wood in dollars so i sell my 
doors shelves and everything else in dollars said carmelo 
gremoni a 60yearold carpenter 
alberto testa collects premiums for an insurance company that 
shifted bills from australs to dollars during an inflationary 
outburst and last month tried to resume billing in australs 
they had to redo everything because the customers 
complained testa said they got used to paying in dollars 
the dollarization of the economy provoked panic when the 
government hinted last december it intended to link wages and 
fiscal expenditures to the us currency to restrict state 
spending 
on new years weekend speculators bid up the dollar to 
6000to1 three times the free market rate at the time hoarding 
and shortages occurred opponents said the proposal meant a loss of 
sovereignty 
the government backed off but the dollars influence expanded 
anyway as the exchange rate held steady at slightly above 
5200to1 since april while the cost of living in australs 
continued to rise by 11 percent or more per month 
now the dollar seems cheap as well as stable and there are 
fewer political and social objections to the widespread use of a 
foreign currency 
bankers say the use of two currencies seems irreversible 
argentines savings in dollars amounts to more than the entire 
money supply in australs and more than central bank reserves and 
most of it is outside the banking system and unavailable for 
lending 
partly as a result interest rates are high investment is low 
and no end is in sight for argentinas deepest recession this 
century

grain and soybean futures drifted lower in early 
trading today on the chicago board of trade 
overall the market is being pressured by forecasts the rains of 
the past few days will be ending that will allow farmers to get on 
with the harvest 
fears of a recession also are worrying the market and pushing 
prices lower said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter 
reynolds inc in chicago 
prices also are pressured lower by anticipation of the us 
agriculture departments october crop estimate due out wednesday 
the report is expected to put the estimated soybean crop at 1832 
billion bushels and the corn crop at 8060 billion bushels 
lespinasse said 
corn futures are being pressured by the soviet unions denial of 
rumors that it purchased us corn overnight and sluggish export 
sales of soybeans are pushing those futures lower 
in early trading wheat was 1 cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 277 a bushel corn was a 
cent to 1 cent lower with december at 233 a bushel oats were a 
cent to 1 cent lower with december at 121 a bushel soybeans 
were 1 cent to 6 cents lower with november at 628 cents a 
bushel 
livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
selling was prompted by tuesdays deep decline on the new york 
stock exchange which reinforced belief the us economy is 
entering a recession 
live cattle were 15 cent to 75 cent lower with october at 79 
cents a pound feeder cattle were 17 cent to 82 cent lower with

three supreme court justices voiced doubts 
today about the wisdom or legality of an employers fetal 
protection policy that excludes all women of childbearing age 
from some hazardous jobs 
in a case that could affect millions of working women justices 
john paul stevens antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor posed 
questions seemingly critical of the policy during an hourlong 
argument session 
stevens questioned stanley jaspan a lawyer for the 
milwaukeebased johnson controls inc about the risks to women 
working in its batterymaking factories 
is the slightest risk enough to justify banning women from 
some jobs stevens asked 
oconnor and scalia took issue with jaspans interpretation of 
what burdens congress placed on employers when it passed the 
pregnancy discrimination act in 1978 
scalia told jaspan his suggestion that the 1978 law means 
employers cannot discriminate against women based on pregnancy 
except to protect a fetus is to make a farce of the pregnancy 
discrimination act youre making it a ridiculous piece of 
legislation 
since 1982 johnson controls the nations largest auto battery 
manufacturer has barred women from factory jobs that expose them 
to unsafe levels of lead the principal material used in making 
batteries 
the policy was upheld by lower courts 
lead exposure is a health risk for female workers and their 
fetuses 
lead exposure of course also is a health risk for male 
workers but the scientific proof that high levels of lead in a 
mans blood can contribute to fetal harm is sketchy 
it would violate common sense to require an employer to 
damage unborn children jaspan argued he said lead exposure 
poisons the fetus and causes permanent brain damage 
but san francisco lawyer marsha berzon representing those who 
challenged the johnson controls policy said the net effect of a 
policy like this is to sanction the resegregation of the 
workplace 
she said such policies relegate women to stereotypical jobs such 
as teaching child care and nursing 
the justices must decide by july whether the fetal protection 
policy amounts to illegal discrimination 
one federal appeals court judge calling the case the most 
important of its kind since congress outlawed onthejob sex bias 
26 years ago said the estimated number of women affected runs as 
high as 20 million 
at johnson controls women who could not prove they were 
infertile were forced to transfer to other jobs although their 
salaries were not cut some of the women were in their 60s 
fertile women now hired are ineligible for toppaying jobs at 
the companys 13 plants located in california delaware florida 
illinois kentucky north carolina michigan missouri ohio 
oregon texas vermont and wisconsin 
eight employees and the united auto workers union challenged the 
policy in court alleging that it violates title vii of the civil 
rights act of 1964 
it was not the first such challenge at least 15 major 
corporations have fetal protection policies and the american civil 
liberties union says lawsuits have been filed in behalf of hospital 
technicians and factory and auto workers 
among the companies with such policies are general motors 
monsanto and dupont 
us district judge robert w warren in milwaukee ruled for 
johnson controls before any trial was held and the 7th us 
circuit court of appeals voted 74 to uphold his ruling 
judge john l coffey wrote for the appeals court that the 
differing treatment of women employees was based on a business 
necessity the appeals court concluded that the policy is 
reasonably necessary to industrial safety 
bush administration lawyers told the high court that a fetal 
protection policy could be legal but that it should be judged by a 
standard more stringent than the business necessity test used 
by the appeals court 
in a strongly worded dissent to the appeals court ruling judge 
frank easterbrook called the case the most important title vii case 
ever and said such policies could consign more women to womens 
work while reserving betterpaying but more hazardous jobs for 
men 
he noted that lead is only one of many workplace substances that 
could harm fetuses and said as many as 20 million jobs could be 
closed to women if the 7th circuit courts rationale were adopted 
nationwide

with or without ivan boesky the first public 
hearing on charges against financial felon michael milken is sure 
to leave some followers of the biggest wall street fraud case 
feeling well cheated 
the minitrial scheduled to begin thursday is designed to 
give us district judge kimba wood more information when she 
sentences the former drexel burnham lambert inc executive to 
anywhere from zero to 28 years in prison 
it will include new allegations of wrongdoing by milken 
testimony by former junk bond coworkers immunized against 
prosecution and counterattacks by topline defense lawyer arthur 
liman 
but some legal experts say that after a fouryear investigation 
and unprecedented charges painting milken as wall streets butch 
cassidy milkens plea bargain and the limited hearing are a poor 
excuse for justice 
we will never have confidence in knowing what happened said 
albert alschuler a criminal law expert at the university of 
chicago law school 
if he is the biggest financial crook of the century its not 
severe enough he said of milkens april guilty plea to six 
felonies if he hasnt done anything wrong its way too severe 
the milken case has come to symbolize the freespending 
mergermanic 1980s supporters portray the 44yearold milken as a 
saintly philanthropist humanitarian savior of american finance 
prosecutors call him systematic calculating greedy 
despite agreeing to pay 600 million in penalties as part of his 
plea bargain milkens wealth still is estimated at 700 million 
but he lives modestly with his wife and three children in encino 
calif 
through hard work and what some call genius milken helped 
create a 200 billion market for ious known as junk bonds that 
transformed secondtier drexel into a model of 80s success and 
power 
for those reasons and the millions of dollars the government 
has spent pursuing him many legal experts feel the public 
deserves a full examination of what if anything milken did wrong 
the minitrial will focus on three allegations of insider 
trading and securities fraud excluded from milkens guilty plea 
federal law permits sentencing judges to consider unproven crimes 
in assessing a defendants character 
the proceeding itself has come under criticism because standards 
of proof are lower than at an ordinary criminal trial its called 
a fatico hearing after a 1979 case involving a thief whom 
prosecutors wanted to show had ties to organized crime 
if the government believes mr milken has committed these 
additional crimes and should be punished for them it should be 
required to prove them beyond a reasonable doubt at trial ira 
glasser head of the american civil liberties union and norman 
siegel head of the new york civil liberties union said in a 
letter to the new york times this week 
but others said the investigation the abandoned 98count 
indictment acceptance of the guilty plea and the fatico hearing 
are part of how the legal system works 
its job is not to tie all the loose ends of the plot 
together new york university law professor stephen gillers said 
judge woods job is to get the sentence right 
the government plans to call more than a dozen witnesses to 
implicate milken in illegal transactions involving securities of 
wickes cos storer communications inc and caesars world inc 
dating to 1983 
prosecutors said tuesday that boesky the inside trader who led 
the government to milken in 1986 after turning states evidence 
wasnt likely to testify milken is expected to be in court during 
the twoweek hearing but it is unclear whether hell take the 
stand 
the hearing amounts to a confrontation between young prosecutors 
and liman best known as senate counsel during the 1987 irancontra 
hearings 
the government wants to demonstrate milkens crimes were 
serious not technical violations the defense will attempt to 
disprove any milken link to insider trading or predatory behavior 
against his clients each will have 20 hours for testimony and 
crossexamination 
strategically its not useful for milken gillers said 
the governments going to be able to try to prove its other 
criminal acts and there will be two weeks worth of headlines about 
those 
liman has complained that the abbreviated hearing undermines 
milkens rights he said government delays in turning over boxes of 
evidence and listing witnesses have hampered his preparation 
in a letter to the judge liman wrote that no one envisioned 
that the peace that a plea agreement is intended to bring would 
be turned into fullscale warfare 
nonetheless the hearing for the first time opens the window on 
the governments case and could offer a revealing snapshot of 
milkens professional behavior wood has said she also will 
consider milkens charitable work and personal character reflected 
in scores of letters from friends and associates 
but proving the allegations would go very far to justifying 
the time and effort the government has put into this case said 
john coffee jr a columbia university securities law professor 
youre talking about someone who was at the crossroads of 
financial capitalism at the most dynamic firm on wall street he 
sai075 
down from 39550 late tuesday 
bullion dealers said their market was slack with strong 
resistance at attempts to push gold above 39250 they said they 
did not expect much activity until there are major developments in 
the gulf 
earlier in hong kong gold closed at a bid 39215 down from 
39535

an agreement that would allow us and 
canadian companies to sell their securities across the border using 
their own countries approved disclosure documents could be in 
effect as early as next year if a proposal aired wednesday is 
approved 
the securities and exchange commission voted unanimously to seek 
public comment on rules changes that would allow canadian companies 
to use forms and documents from their home country to satisfy us 
disclosure requirements 
a reciprocal agreement allowing us companies to use us 
documents when selling stocks and bonds north of the border is 
pending in canada 
sec chairman richard c breeden said the proposal could be a 
prototype for offerings between the united states and other 
countries 
the sec proposal cannot become final until the sec staff reviews 
the comment letters and submits the rule change to the 
commissioners for a final vote breeden said he hoped that could be 
achieved by the end of the year or early 1991 
the fivemember sec was created by congress to oversee the 
stocks and bonds markets and other aspects of the securities 
industry to protect the investing public from fraud 
sec regulations require companies offering securities for sale 
to the public to disclose enough information for investors to make 
informed decisions among other things companies issuing 
securities must say why they need the money from securities sales 
who runs the company and how much money it owes to banks and other 
lending institutions 
some foreign companies have opted not to offer their stocks or 
bonds in the united states because they are unwilling to divulge 
such information 
others simply dont want to bother with the added expense of 
hiring lawyers accountants and other professionals needed to 
complete the complex documents 
the proposal a revised version of one first offered in july 
1989 would allow canadian concerns under certain restrictions to 
sell their securities here using disclosure documents approved by 
canadian regulators 
for example the revised rules would let any canadian company 
sell stock in the united states using canadian disclosure documents 
if the firm has been registered with a canadian regulator for at 
least three years has 75 million in shares outstanding and 300 
million market capitalization 
a reciprocal agreement allowing us companies to sell their 
stock in canada using us disclosure documents will be considered 
by securities regulators in the provinces of quebec and ontario 
where canadas major stock exchanges are located 
canada does not have a nationwide securities regulator 
the purpose of this rule is to make it easier for companies in 
both the us and canada who want to raise capital to support their 
activities growth and development said breeden 
the public meeting was the first attended by the newest sec 
commissioner richard y roberts who was sworn in last week it 
marked he first time in more than a year there were no vacancies 
on the fivemember commission

in the great chase to attract jobs state after 
state banked on deregulation during the 1980s to bring credit card 
issuers to their doors 
south dakota acted first attracting the plum of the industry 
citibank in 1980 delaware followed quickly and 18 other states 
have since removed their ceilings on rates or fees as they 
scrambled to create cozy environments for credit card issuers 
but critics question whether the state legislatures in their 
rush to deregulate plastic have trampled over consumers by allowing 
the banks to charge high interest rates and the nowprevalent 
annual fees 
theres no question in our minds that one of the reasons the 
states are taking these actions is to lure bank card operations 
from other states with the promise that these card operations will 
be able to charge any rates and fees they choose said elgie 
holstein director of bankcard holders of america a herndon 
vabased consumer group 
from that standpoint there has been throughout the 1980s a 
continuing willingness by state policy makers to look the other way 
as rates go higher he said 
holstein said that prior to 1980 there were virtually no annual 
fees for credit card users now theyre commonplace and cost 
anywhere from a few dollars a year to an average of 34 for premium 
gold cards 
credit card interest rates also have remained consistently high 
in recent years hovering around 19 percent on average 
regardless of changing economic conditions 
when theres been periods of rate decline credit card rates 
remain stubbornly high said robert k heady publisher of bank 
rate monitor in north palm beach fla 
for example he noted rates for certficiates of deposit fell 
166 percentage points since april 1989 while at the same time 
credit card rates rose an average of twothirds of a point 
nonetheless state officials say deregulation has proven itself 
to be a solid means of attracting jobs and the bank industry 
maintains deregulation has benefited consumers by increasing 
competition among card issuers and widening access to credit 
south dakota and delaware by acting early in passing attractive 
legislation have won a solid hold as the premier host states for 
credit card business and continue to dominate the field 
a ripple has been created in georgia recently by the success of 
american telephone amp telegraph cos universal card which was 
introduced last spring and already has 27 million cardholders the 
card is issued by the universal bank a subsidiary of columbus 
gabased synovus financial corp 
credit card banks such as universal which deal exclusively in 
bankcards are sometimes called nonbanks and are not subject 
to all the regulations as fullservice institutions 
theyre not streetfront operations theyre strictly 
secondfloor operations said robert moler deputy commissioner 
of the georgia department of banking and finance 
nonbanks have become more prevalent since the wave of credit 
card deregulation that began a decade ago when south dakota changed 
its laws to attract citibanks credit card operation from new york 
that move came in the wake of a 1978 us supreme court decision 
that said banks must adhere to the credit card interest rate limits 
of their home state some banks then sought to locate in states 
with unlimited rates structures so they could export those 
rates 
the whole concept really comes down to jobs said steve 
szekely of payment systems inc of tampa fla a industry research 
organization when the banks started making moves the states had 
to relax interest rate restrictions to keep the jobs 
richard duncan state banking director in south dakota said 
citibank and the eight other credit card issuers who have moved to 
his state since 1980 have had a significant impact on the economy 
there 
what its done for the state is bring in employment and 
revenue that im sure has exceeded what was anticipated duncan 
said 
citibank employs 2000 people in south dakota and pumps in more 
than 20 million a year through the state franchise tax in a 
state the size of south dakota which only has about 700000 
people that makes a difference duncan said 
still consumer groups say the job impact from the average 
issuer much smaller than the citibanks of the world does not 
justify the higher rates and fees that accompany deregulation 
the credit card business is extremely capital intensive and 
generally does not require a large work force said holstein of 
the bankcard holders youre getting a handful of jobs but 
millions of dollars extra are paid by consumers he said 
but virginia stafford spokeswoman for the washingtonbased 
american bankers association said deregulation has increased 
access to credit by putting more players in the market and making 
banks more competitive 
the bank card business is a volume kind of business she 
said its allowed consumers to have access to credit cards that 
they ordinarily wouldnt have access to locally 
without deregulation credit cards may have become available 
mainly to wealthy customers considered safe risks by the banks 
she said 
standardized disclosure requirements in place since last year 
also have provided consumers with more information about the cards 
so that they may shop around for the best deal ms stafford added 
south dakotas duncan maintains that competition from the 
growing field of card issuers has helped keep rates from getting 
out of hand 
you can get credit cards from a barrage of sources he said 
the price may be a little higher but i think people are willing 
to pay a little more to get the convenience 
moler of the georgia banking department said the credit card 
banks because of their narrow focus escape some of the 
regulations applied to full service banks such as being tested for 
how well they serve the needs of a community but the banks 
activities are restricted to issuing cards 
atampt spokesman bruce reid said his company put in more than two 
years of research before deciding on the georgia bank to unveil the 
universal card georgia laws are very favorable as they would be 
in south dakota and delaware the regulatory climate was what 
we were looking for he said 
the universal cards temporary offer of a lifetime ban on annual 
fees and the ability to use the card as an atampt calling card has 
contributed to its success analysts say 
but it also prompted some banks who issue mastercard and visa 
including citibank parent citicorp and chase manhattan corp to 
file complaints with the federal government that the universal 
nonbank had an unfair advantage because of its telephone 
tiein

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower wednesday on the chicago board of trade as the market reacted 
to sagging export demand for us products 
corn futures were influenced by slack demand from overseas with 
the soviet union denying it had purchased us corn overnight in 
europe it received some support from reports the soviets would 
eventually make a purchase 
slack sales by farmers also gave a boost to corn prices 
overall the market was pressured by forecasts the rains of the 
past few days will be ending that will allow farmers to get on 
with the harvest said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
trading was cautious in anticipation of the release thursday of 
the us agriculture departments october crop production report 
the report is expected to put the estimated soybean crop at 
1832 billion bushels and the corn crop at 8060 billion bushels 
said victor lespinasse an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
in chicago 
at the close wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 276 a bushel corn was a 
cent to 1 cents higher with december at 235 a bushel oats were 
a cent to 1 cent higher with december at 123 a bushel soybeans 
were 4 cents to 9 cents lower with november at 625 a bushel

wall street executives teaching the soviets about 
financial markets said wednesday they told their hosts to start by 
selling shares in the profitable state airline tourist agency and 
petroleum businesses 
the us delegation led by new york stock exchange chairman john 
j phelan jr also met for 90 minutes with president mikhail 
gorbachev and signed a formal cooperation agreement with finance 
officials to exchange information 
phelan told a news conference that gorbachev asked them to 
continue advising his government on its switch to a market economy 
which includes the reestablishment of stock exchanges 
several plans proposed to rescue the soviet economy envisage a 
stock exchange by the end of this year but the government hasnt 
set a specific time frame 
i think that the stock exchange itself will emerge as the 
result of the development of market relations in general throughout 
the country finance minister valentin pavlov told reporters 
covering the nyse delegation 
how soon we will be able to realize that i dont think we are 
in a position anyone is in a position to give a firm answer 
more than 400 soviet bankers academics researchers and 
brokersinwaiting attended a seminar given by the americans in 
moscows international trade center they absorbed detailed 
descriptions of how american markets work and prodded their 
government officials to move faster to copy them 
many members of the wall street delegation recommended the 
government start its privatization program with its most profitable 
enterprises such as the aeroflot state airline the intourist 
travel agency or parts of the nations huge oil industry 
the government is drafting legislation to permit stock 
exchanges but a businessmens committee said it will register one 
in moscow next month whether or not the regulations are in place 
the new moscow commodities exchange which held one day of listless 
trading last month said it was also trying to set up an equities 
section 
pavlov predicted any fledgling soviet stock exchange would begin 
by trading bonds rather than equities 
that would give the government time to develop a plan to sell 
off its wealth of factories and other means of production since 
june it has allowed some state enterprises to become jointstock 
companies but has generally retained a majority interest 
bonds usually issued by governments pay the buyer a fixed 
annual interest rate and can be redeemed at a specified date 
john chalsty president of the securities firm donaldson lufkin 
amp jenrette inc said trading in bonds would be a logical first 
step 
theres more familiarity i think with fixedincome 
securities bearing specified interest rates he said in an 
interview 
it was my sense that a securities exchange can in fact be 
established in relatively short order that it can start trading 
securities mostly fixedincome but that it will be a slow process 
before you actually get stocks shares of ownership traded on the 
exchange he said 
i dont know when that will come because that will depend on 
the progress of privatization 
phelan said a successful stock exchange will also require a 
cultural change among the soviet people many of whom remain 
suspicious of entrepreneurs 
there also has to be a feeling that its not illegal to 
have a profitable negotiation between two people that profit is 
what drives the economy and makes it more efficient he said 
thats going to take time to change and come about 
pavlov agreed 
as soon as neighbors will become aware that it is profitable 
to buy stock much more profitable than hoarding money in the 
mattress then we can expect a breakthrough he said

buyout strategist theodore forstmann is seeking 
investors for a 15 billion fund that would finance acquisitions 
of companies by using debt a source knowledgable about the 
proposal said wednesday 
the venture is likely to be watched by wall street as a 
barometer of the market for debtfinanced buyouts since the 
collapse of the junk bond market a year ago many investors have 
shunned the idea of funding acquisitions primarily with debt 
the source said forstmann is planning to offer investors in his 
fund yields 1 percent above the interest rate on fiveyear treasury 
bonds which now yield about 85 percent 
forstmann is seeking about 20 institutional investors according 
to the source who spokeon condition of anonymity 
a spokesman for forstmann john scanlon declined comment on the 
proposal and refused to confirm or deny the buyout strategists 
plans 
forstmann has long opposed the use of junk bonds which have 
yields as high as 20 percent to fund buyouts although his debt 
funds like junk bonds are subordinated falling behind bank debt 
and secured debt in credit rankings 
however forstmann says his brand of debt financing differs from 
junk bonds because it is not publicly underwritten and because his 
investors take a 375 percent equity stake in acquired companies 
despite the slowdown in mergers and takeovers forstmanns 
buyout firm forstmann little amp co has been quite active 
acquiring general instrument corp for 16 billion in august and 
participating in the buyout of chrysler corps gulfstream 
aerospace corp earlier this year 
last year forstmann tried but failed to put together a fund 
known as a white squire fund that planned to take large stakes in 
companies that were overburdened by debt

the state of delaware plans to join a lawsuit 
against the federal reserve board to overturn an order that blocks 
citicorp from selling and underwriting insurance nationwide 
citicorp filed suit against the fed late last week in us 
second circuit court of appeals in new york 
in early september the fed ruled that a new delaware law 
allowing banks to sell and underwrite insurance nationwide gave 
financial institutions powers prohibited by federal regulations 
citicorp is arguing the fed lacks jurisdiction over delaware law 
because citicorps insurance company family guardian is a 
division of the bank not a subsidiary 
delaware bank commissioner keith ellis said tuesday the state 
plans to ask the court to allow it to become a party to the suit 
rather than limit itself to filing a friend of the court brief 
the state has a real interest in becoming a part to the suit 
as a way of showing our independent interest in the case ellis 
said 
citicorp began selling primarily life and health insurance 
through family guardian after delawares legislation became law in 
may 
delaware officials said the law satisfied requirements of the 
federal deposit insurance corp to protect insured deposits but 
the fed said the state went too far to protect depositors

their names were fuji judo mazda and 
ryusho before they died of old age years ago they left behind a 
genetic legacy worth millions for cattle breeder don lively but 
which the japanese claim was a stolen national treasure 
the legacy is semen collected from the four japanese bulls and 
brought to the united states in a shroud of secrecy 14 years ago 
some people now say the semen is a rare commodity that could 
revolutionize the beef industry in both countries 
livelys stockpile of semen from the famed wagyu cattle 
pronounced wogyou believed to be the only ones of the breed to 
ever leave their homeland is estimated to be worth 2 million 
cattlemen and agribusiness companies from all over the orld 
have come clamoring to livelys lodo ranch to buy some of the semen 
so they can start breeding their own herds of wagyu cattle 
the wagyus tender slightly sweettasting meat called kobe 
beef is considered a delicacy that fetches up to 180 a pound in 
japan the spindly legged and swaybacked beasts once only brought 
bewildered stares from us breeders who prefer much stockier 
cattle 
research from texas aampm university indicates kobe beef is 
markedly lower in cholesterol than other beef 
but ever since japan said it would lift beef import quotas by 
1991 american cattlemen have hungrily eyed the wagyu so have 
japanese investors with vast holdings of land in the united states 
they cant increase cattle production in japan they dont 
have the land lively said 
lively and his business partner rosebud rancher fred 
hildebrand already have sold off hundreds of the semen samples 
used to artificially inseminate cows for about 1 million each 
vial costs 250 
people used to think i was crazy for having these cattle 
says lively 62 
the japanese have always been fond of the cattle and reluctant 
to share the breed with the rest of the world they have closely 
guarded the cattle and steadfastly refuse to export them 
youd be classified as a traitor if you brought it out of 
japan lively says the japanese are resentful that we have 
wagyu cattle some of them wont even admit these are wagyu when we 
show the cattle to them 
if you could raise wagyu cattle here and be the first one to 
back into japan with kobe beef you got yourself a market be it a 
niche or the corner on a billion dollars itll probably be a 
billion dollars he said 
lively and others in the beef industry also believe us 
breeders could reap huge profits off wagyus in the domestic cattle 
market where some wagyu cattle have sold for 20000 to 30000 a 
head 
there are about 900000 head of wagyu cattle in japan today 
fewer than 60 purebreds exist in the united states lively and his 
partner own most of those 
the first four wagyu bulls lively says were brought to the 
united states by a texas cattleman named morris whitney with the 
help of a mysterious japanese partner whitney later sold them to a 
georgetown veterinarian 
both men tried in vain to turn a profit on the cattle seeking 
out investors in a highstakes cattle venture that soon went bust 
lively says he and hildebrand eventually ended up with the 
seemingly worthless wagyu bulls 
now their semen is worth a small fortune and a smiling lively 
refuses to eat any other kind of beef other than the kobe meat he 
raises 
why would i do that he asks im already eating the 
finest beef around

three of the supreme courts nine justices 
gave a chilly reception wednesday to an employers fetal 
protection policy that excludes women of childbearing age from 
some hazardous jobs 
in a case that could affect millions of working women justices 
john paul stevens sandra day oconnor and antonin scalia voiced 
doubts about the wisdom and legality of such a policy 
the court is expected to decide by july whether the policy 
amounts to illegal sex discrimination 
the three justices along with justice anthony m kennedy 
dominated an hourlong argument session they posed numerous 
questions to the two lawyers before them firing their most biting 
inquiries at stanley jaspan who represented the milwaukeebased 
johnson controls inc 
stevens seemed dubious when asking jaspan about the overall risk 
posed to women working at johnson controls 13 batterymaking 
plants 
when jaspan argued that exposure to lead the principal material 
used in making batteries poisons the fetus and causes permanent 
brain damage stevens interrupted to ask how often does this 
happen 
he asked whether the slightest risk was enough to render 
inapplicable a federal law title vii of the civil rights act of 
1964 banning onthejob sex bias 
oconnor and scalia took issue with jaspans interpretation of 
what legal duty employers face under a 1978 amendment called the 
pregnancy discrimination act to the law 
you are not coming to grips with the effect of the pregnancy 
discrimination act oconnor told jaspan 
and scalia said jaspans suggestion that employers may treat 
pregnant workers differently if fetal health is an issue is to 
make a farce of the 1978 law youre making it a ridiculous 
piece of legislation scalia said 
but jaspan held firm in defending the companys policy it 
would violate common sense to require an employer to damage 
unborn children he argued 
marsha berzon the san francisco lawyer representing the 
policys challengers told the justices the net effect of a 
policy like this is to sanction the resegregation of the work 
force 
she said such policies could render women marginal workers and 
oust them from the workplace 
one federal judge calling the case the most important sexbias 
dispute in decades said the estimated number of women affected 
runs as high as 20 million 
chief justice william h rehnquist and justice byron r white 
each asked only one question during wednesdays session 
three court members justices david h souter thurgood 
marshall and harry a blackmun did not ask any questions 
the nations largest manufacturer of car batteries johnson 
controls adopted its policy in 1982 declaring certain jobs off 
limits for fertile women 
those who could not prove they were infertile were transferred 
to other jobs although their salaries were not cut some of the 
women were in their 60s 
fertile women now hired are ineligible for toppaying jobs with 
the greatest lead exposure at the companys plants in california 
delaware florida illinois kentucky north carolina michigan 
missouri ohio oregon texas vermont and wisconsin 
the policy was upheld in lower courts

oil prices seesawed wildly in the futures market 
wednesday first jumping into record territory above 41 a barrel 
then tumbling on a vague rumor that iraqi president saddam hussein 
had been killed 
its been a rumordriven day said annlouise hittle a 
senior oil analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
disregarding the rumors some of the strength we have seen is not 
being sustained 
light sweet crude closed 171 lower at 3869 per barrel for 
november delivery contracts on the new york mercantile exchange 
later delivery months were all down by more than 1 a barrel 
in early trading crude futures had moved to an alltime 
exchange high of 4115 per barrel after closing above 40 per 
barrel for the first time on tuesday 
early oil prices were following the london futures market which 
had advanced on a rumor that us troops had been dispatched into 
kuwait the us government squelched the rumor before the new york 
exchange opened but that failed to stop the momentum that oil had 
gotten from the story 
the strength was retained just on general nervousness 
hittle said 
oil later turned downward on the saddam death rumor 
a lot of people thought that was a good reason to start 
selling said peter beutel an oil analyst with pegasus 
econometric group inc in hoboken nj once the selling started 
there were no buyers pushing prices back up traders said 
the recent speculation surrounding oil contracts in the futures 
market drew criticism wednesday from sen joseph i lieberman 
dconn who asked regulators to take a closer look at the way 
business is conducted on the mercantile exchange a leading 
petroleum market 
the teeth of these speculator sharks are ripping away at the 
muscle of our economy lieberman said 
lieberman suggested oil speculators should have to put up more 
money when they make deals he said the amount of oil they trade on 
the futures market should perhaps be limited 
the exchange has raised the amount investors must now put up to 
make oil deals in what officials believe is an appropriate response 
to the recent wild fluctuations a spokeswoman said 
at current prices traders are required to put up about 20 
percent to 25 percent of the value of the contract 
there are limits on the amount of oil that can be traded at 
once basically 1 million barrels for next month delivery but for 
big oil companies the limits can be raised to levels that the 
exchange will not make public the spokeswoman said 
oils dive on wednesday was imitated by other energy futures 
wholesale home heating oil dropped 510 cents to 10105 per 
gallon on november contracts with other months all down wholesale 
unleaded gasoline was down 466 cents to 9360 cents per gallon on 
november contracts with all other months down 
natural gas was unchanged at 194 per 1000 cubic feet on 
november contracts while later delivery months fell 
after the futures market closed the leading industry group 
released a report showing the us crude stockpile had fallen 
farther than many analysts had been predicting 
the crude stocks dropped to 3504 million barrels from 3546 
million barrels a week earlier but they remained above the level 
of 3371 million barrels a year earlier the american petroleum 
institute said in its weekly report 
gasoline stocks rose to 2257 million barrels from 2239 
million barrels a week earlier although they were below the level 
of 2258 million barrels a year earlier stocks of distillates 
which include home heating oil fell to 1333 million barrels from 
1348 million barrels a week earlier but they remained above their 
level a year earlier of 1218 million barrels 
the nations refinery capacity fell to 876 percent compared

an adviser to bondholders of donald trumps taj 
mahal casino reported progress wednesday in talks to restructure 
675 million of the casinos debt 
the talks are proceeding in a constructive fashion said 
wilbur ross senior managing partner at rothschild inc but he 
added you dont have a deal on anything till you have a deal on 
everything 
the taj mahal faces a 473 million interest payment nov 15 on 
the 675 million in bonds the bonds were issued to finance 
construction of the atlantic city casino 
fitch investors service inc a credit rating company reported 
wednesday that bondholders may seek an equity stake of up to 50 
percent in the taj mahal ross said he had no comment on the 
report and would not discuss what concessions bondholders are 
seeking from trump in return for the restructuring 
trump currently holds all of the equity in the taj mahal as well 
as his other atlantic city casinos trump plaza and trump castle 
trump plaza has fared the best of the three but all suffer from 
the same cash flow malaise that has afflicted all casinos in the 
city 
in june trump reached an agreement with bankers who lent him 
65 million to meet interest payments on his bonds while he looked 
for a more permanent solution to the problems of his debtridden 
real estate and casino empire 
trump has an estimated 2 billion in bank debts in addition to 
the 13 owed to casino bondholders 
there have been a number of reports over the past few months 
that trump would sell the plaza hotel in new york or the trump 
shuttle the airline serving new york washington and boston to 
help reduce his debt however there have been no announcements 
from the trump organization about any asset sales 
fitch reported that some bondholders were seeking the closure or 
liquidation of the taj mahal but ross called the report 
extremely farfetched 
ross said trump also owes about 100 million to contractors and 
banks who loaned him money for the taj mahal which opened earlier 
this year

general motors corp of canada and union leaders 
worked down to the wire wednesday night to come up with a contract 
proposal before a midnight strike deadline 
bob white president of the canadian auto workers said the 
deadline would not be extended but on wednesday evening a union 
spokesman said financial matters had been settled leaving only 
local issues to be resolved 
the caw represents 36500 workers at gm the company has 13 
plants in ontario and one in stetherese quebec 
white said the main stumbling blocks in negotiations were the 
companys plan to close a van plant in scarborough and to lay off 
workers at a trim plant in windsor 
gm has said it will cut 700 jobs at the windsor plant which 
employs about 2500 people making seat covers seats and doors but 
the company announced last week it would delay closing the van 
plant until spring 1992 giving 2500 workers a few more months of 
work 
key issues for the company are costcompetitiveness job 
flexibility and improved attendance

congressional negotiators reached a tentative 
agreement wednesday on auto emission standards removing a major 
obstacle that had threatened approval of a clean air bill this 
year 
a dispute over state enforcement of auto pollution requirements 
had held up agreement on the motor vehicle section of the bill for 
more than a week 
the compromise calls for tougher tailpipe emission controls a 
phasein of alternative fuel vehicles and cleaner gasoline blends 
in areas with the worst smog problem 
its a major breakthrough said sen max baucus dmont 
head of the senate negotiating team he said the motor vehicle 
section of the massive bill was the toughest obstacle to 
resolving differences in the clean air bills that passed the house 
and senate earlier this year 
with the touchy issue of auto emissions out of the way the 
staff negotiators meeting behind closed doors turned immediately 
to what new controls should be imposed on industry to curb the 
release of toxic chemicals 
congressional leaders meanwhile told heads of both the house 
and senate negotiating teams wednesday they wanted the legislation 
completed by sunday so the measure could clear congress before the 
planned oct 19 adjournment 
baucus said in an interview that he hoped the housesenate 
conferees might formally approve the legislation by next monday 
thats the goal he said 
the bill would be the first tightening of federal air pollution 
laws in 13 years and imposes new emission requirements on electric 
utilities factories thousands of small businesses and automobiles 
to curb urban smog acid rain and toxic releases 
agreement on the motor vehicles section had been considered one 
of the trickiest areas to resolve in the talks which have been 
going on since july 13 
both senate and house negotiators said the agreement on motor 
vehicles was a major step forward but some still expressed concern 
that the bill might be derailed in the closing days of the 
congressional session 
weve got two big sections left said sen john chafee 
rri one of the negotiators these sections deal with toxic 
chemical releases by industry and acid rain pollutants 
chafee estimated there was a 7030 chance of a bill clearing 
congress this year but warned that even if a compromise bill is 
completed by sunday it still must then be approved by both chambers 
where a very few people could derail it 
the compromise reached by staff members on auto emission must 
still be approved formally by members of the house and senate 
conference committee but that was described as all but certain 
the compromise would require a 30 percent to 60 percent cut in 
various smogcausing tailpipe emissions by 1998 it also calls for 
a phasein of alternative fuel cars through a pilot program in 
california which other states also could adopt require fleets to 
use alternative fuel vehicles and require that oil companies sell 
cleaner burning gasoline in cities facing the worst smog problems 
daniel weiss who has followed the clean air debates for the 
sierra club called the compromise a very ambitious program for 
cleaning the air in americas cities but said in many areas the 
benefits will not be seen until toward the end of the decade 
the auto and oil companies would have to reduce their 
pollution by far less than what theyre capable of doing said 
weiss he said in many areas such as alternative fuels for fleets 
the controls were pushed back several years under the compromise 
the compromise resolved concerns over state enforcement of auto 
emissions standards which had blocked significant progress in the 
negotiations for more than a week 
state air pollution control officials and others including gov 
mario cuomo of new york had strongly objected to a provision in 
the legislation that would have prevented states from adopting and 
enforcing tougher emission controls already in effect in 
california 
the bill would have left enforcement to the federal 
environmental protection agency 
but under the compromise that provision was modified to require 
that states adopt either the california emissions controls or stick 
to the federal controls rep john dingell dmich had sought the 
prohibition to keep states from adopting numerous standards which 
he argued would require automakers to produce specially designed 
cars in various states

silver futures prices plunged sharply wednesday on new yorks 
commodity exchange as the market continued to be burdened by 
abundant supplies 
on other markets oil prices declined on a market influenced by 
rumors grain and soybean futures were mostly lower gold prices 
fell and livestock and pork futures retreated 
silver settled 184 cents 207 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in october at 4409 a troy ounce 
the 188 cent plunge for the december silver contract dropped 
the metal to a 13year low 
the reason for the overall weakness of silver is simple 
there is a lot of silver around the supply is enormous said 
peter cardillo an analyst with jesup josephthal amp co inc in new 
york 
analysts noted that production of silver is increasing as demand 
from automakers and the photographic industry is decreasing 
adding to the weakness of silver is the perception it is a base 
metal and is prone to recession and inflation concern 
silver was once considered the poor man investment cardillo 
said in the past silver would react to international turmoil 
unfortunately in recent years that has disappeared it is not 
considered the safe haven that it once was 
profittaking fueled a selloff of energy futures on the new york 
mercantile exchange in trading that saw prices influenced by 
rumors 
reports that us troops have invaded kuwait sent prices higher 
in early trading but prices fell after the state department denied 
military action was taking place and slipped lower on rumors of 
the death of iraqi president saddam hussein those rumors were also 
proven false 
profittaking was the primary factor behind the drop in prices 
said andrew lebow an analyst with ed amp f man international 
futures inc he noted there was little fresh news from the middle 
east to influence the market 
light sweet crude was 41 cents to 171 lower with november at 
3869 a barrel heating oil was 187 cents to 510 cents lower 
with november at 1010 a gallon unleaded gasoline was 270cents 
to 466 cents lower with november at 9360 cents a gallon 
gold futures were pushed lower due to weakness in energy market 
analysts said 
cardillo noted that gold has not reacted strongly to the crisis 
in the middle east because producer nations continue to unload 
their gold supplies 
gold was 160 to 180 lower with october at 38810 a troy 
ounce 
grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the 
chicago board of trade 
corn futures were influenced by slack demand from overseas it 
received some support from reports the soviets would eventually 
make a purchase 
slack sales by farmers also gave a boost to corn prices 
overall the market was pressured by forecasts the rains of the 
past few days will be ending that will allow farmers to get on 
with the harvest said joel karlin an analyst with research 
department inc in chicago 
trading was cautious in anticipation of the release thursday of 
the us agriculture departments october crop production report 
wheat was 1 cent to 3 cents lower with delivery in december at 
276 a bushel corn was a cent to 1 cents higher with december 
at 235 a bushel oats were a cent to 1 cent higher with 
december at 123 a bushel soybeans were 4 cents to 9 cents 
lower with november at 625 a bushel 
livestock and pork futures were lower in trading on the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
pork prices were pressured by a drop in cash prices 
slack demand for beef products pushed livestock futures lower 
analysts said the market also was pressured by concerns that the 
us economic outlook is weak 
live cattle were 37 cent to 88 cent lower with october at 
7920 cents a pound feeder cattle were 25 cent to 85 cent lower 
with october at 8770 cents a pound hogs were 15 cent to 50 cent 
lower with october at 5657 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 
110 cent lower to 20 cent higher with february at 6340 cents a 
pound

here are details of three alleged illegal 
transactions prosecutors claim were committed by junk bond 
financier michael milken that will be aired at a special court 
hearing starting thursday 
the allegations were contained in the governments 
presentencing memorandum accusing the former drexel burnham 
lambert inc financier of widespread wrongdoing beyond the six 
felonies to which he has pleaded guilty 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the government claims milken used nonpublic information to buy 
more than 3 million in caesars bonds in 1983 prior to 
announcement of debt restructuring managed by drexel the 
government says the bonds were bought by drexel and sold two days 
later to milkens personal retirement account 
the government says the idea for a debtforstock swap was 
broached at a june 29 1983 meeting among milken other drexel 
executives and caesars representatives the government claims 
caesars officials favored the idea and committed to it july 1 the 
defense maintains that didnt happen for a week 
the bond purchases by drexel were dated june 30 and in turn were 
sold to milken a day later 
milkens lawyers said the securities and exchange commission in 
1985 investigated the trading and found no wrongdoing they said 
caesars had not decided on a restructuring when drexel made the 
purchases 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
prosecutors allege boesky bought storer securities in july 1985 
after milken tipped him about a proposed leveraged buyout by 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which hired drexel to secure 
financing prosecutors claim more than 1 million in trading 
profits were credited to drexel in january 1986 
according to court papers milken allegedly bribed money 
managers to buy risky storer securities by selling other securities 
of the florida cable television company at below market value they 
allege milken also misappropriated warrants that would allow a 
purchase of 25 percent of the company to private partnerships in 
which he had an interest 
the government alleges that cash proceeds from the storer 
transactions surpassed 325 million with milken and another 
unidentified individual personally making 172 million in 1988 
milkens lawyers say the claims are based both on 
misunderstandings and misstatement of the facts and the law they 
say kkr gave drexel discretion to sell warrants and that money 
managers have denied the alleged kickback arrangement 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the government claims milken asked boesky to buy a large block 
of shares of wickes a california building products business to 
push up its stock price and make it qualify for a special and 
costly dividend 
wickes hired drexel in 1985 to raise money via a series of 
securities offerings including two promising a high fixed dividend 
of 250 per share the company did not have to redeem the shares 
for three years unless its stock closed above 612 for 20 out of 
30 consecutive trading days 
the government alleges milken pushed his traders to find buyers 
of wickes stock to drive up the price when the stock reached the 
level on 19 of 28 days in spring 1986 milken allegedly had boesky 
buy 19 million shares late in a trading day pushing it above the 
required level that helped wickes avoid having to pay the 
expensive dividend for the full three years

the government said wendesday it got no takers 
for almost a fifth of the nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil 
offered from the strategic petroleum reserve 
the energy department said it has selected 11 companies for the 
purchase of a little less than 4 million barrels of oil from the 
reserve under the test drawdown order givn by president bush last 
month 
the department said the amount was short of what had been 
expected to be sold because there were no bids for more than 
800000 barrels of highsulfur sour crude that were offered 
the sour crude was one of six types of oil offered from the reserve 
stocks in salt domes along the texas and louisiana coasts 
buyers will take 135 million barrels of other kinds of sour 
crude 
some refineries cannot process highsulfur crude because it 
corrodes their equipment 
the lack of interest in the sour crude was attributed to an 
expected increase in the amount of similar oil from alaskas north 
slope at gulf coast ports next month 
energy secretary james watkins said as much as 100000 barrels a 
day of sour crude is expected to arrive at gulf coast refineries in 
november when most deliveries will occur from the government 
reserve 
it is quite likely that this has reduced the demand for the 
type of sour crude we offered said watkins 
that rejected sour crude would have come from weeks island la 
sour crudes that were accepted will come from other storage sites 
amoco oil co will receive the most oil 112 million barrels 
from the drawdown 
other selected bidders are bp oil supply co citgo petroleum 
fina oil and chemical co mobil oil corp marathon petroleum co 
phibro energy shell oil co sun refining and marketing 
transworld oil usa and ultramar inc 
the department said there was adequate demand for the other 
types of oil that were offered as 33 companies submitted bids for 
104 million barrels 
successful bids ranged from 3264 to 3906 per barrel the 
department will be able to adjust those prices somewhat to reflect 
changes in the oil market before delivery
