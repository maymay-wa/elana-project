eds leads thruout to update with fridays meeting of shultz and 
deng no pickup 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
chinas senior leader deng xiaoping told visiting 
us secretary of state george shultz on friday that their two 
nations should lift relations to a higher plane in the interest 
of the whole world 
the 83yearold deng said at the opening of the talks with 
shultz that chineseamerican relations have improved steadily 
during the reagan presidency 
of course there are still some problems between us he 
said i think it is quite natural for two countries to have a 
divergent point of view or even have differences 
shultz held talks with chinese officials thursday on the 
cambodian conflict and chinese weapons sales to the middle east 
on friday however deng stressed common interests though 
china is one of the poorest countries in the world and the united 
states is one of the richest countries he said after all 
both of us are big countries 
we should bring our relationship to a higher plane in the 
interest of peace and the interest of the people of the world 
shultz said i have a very confident feeling that the 
relationship thats developed between the united states and china 
has broad bipartisan support and so we can expect real continuity 
in this relationship 
shultz arrived thursday for a twoday visit his fourth to china 
since he assumed his post in 1982 
the secretary also met friday with premier li peng before 
afternoon talks with communist party secretarygeneral zhao ziyang 
deng has retired from all his posts except chairmanship of the 
central military commission 
however he still wields considerable influence in the 
government and party he was apparently in good spirits friday 
smiling and going out of his way to shake hands with american 
security guards 
he told shultz who was on the sixth stop of a ninenation asian 
tour i think you are the busiest man on earth 
on thursday shultz met for more than three hours with foreign 
minister qian qichen for what the american side characterized as 
a very good exchange they discussed cambodia and the 
proliferation of weapons sales in developing countries 
qian emphasized that china does not support the return of the 
khmer rouge to a dominant role in cambodia following the withdrawal 
of vietnamese troops 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 to end a threeyear reign 
of terror by the khmer rouge it says it will pull out its 
estimated 120000 troops in the next few years the united states 
and southeast asian countries have expressed concern that the khmer 
rouge backed by chinese arms will step into the power vacuum 
however qian said thursday that some senior khmer rouge leaders 
may retire the remark suggested that pol pot and others associated 
with bloody policies of the mid70s will not play a role in any 
future cambodian government 
qian also said china foresees a potential role for an 
international peacekeeping force in cambodia both china and the 
united states have called for an immediate end to vietnams 
military occupation 
shultz in his talks with qian and at a later banquet speech 
spoke in general terms of the dangers of introducing sophisticated 
weapons into the middle east and other unstable regions 
but us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said he 
did not specifically criticize china for selling intermediaterange 
ballistic missiles to mideast countries while moscow and washington 
are eliminating such weapons from their arsenals shultz had made 
such criticism earlier on his tour 
shultz said in his banquet speech it is ironic that just as 
the major powers are making progress in getting their arms 
competition under some control the developing world is 
increasingly burdened by this flow of advanced weaponry 
the united states is concerned that china a major arms supplier 
to iran iraq and other middle east nations has sold the css2 
missile to saudi arabia and is developing and already marketing the 
m9 missile in the region 
according to us figures china sold about 2 billion worth of 
arms last year 
qian was quoted as telling shultz that china sells only 
defensive weapons that contribute to peace and regional stability 
shultz also applauded recent south korean moves to ease tensions 
on the korean peninsula and called on north korea to respond and 
help ensure a safe and successful olympic games in seoul the 
souths capital this fall china is a close ally of communist 
north korea 
shultz was scheduled to leave saturday morning for seoul his 
tour was also to take him to japan and the marshall islands

us warships do not routinely monitor radio 
communications between airliners and air traffic controllers in the 
persian gulf and have not regularly done so since the uss vincennes 
shot down iran air flight 655 say pentagon officials 
iran says the a300 airbus had communicated with air traffic 
control at bandar abbas iran in english the international 
language for airlines and that if the vincennes had been 
listening it might not have mistaken the airliner for an iranian 
f14 fighter 
iran has asked the united nations security council and 
international civil aviation organization to review the july 3 
incident the pentagon is conducting its own investigation which 
spokesman dan howard has said will determine what radio and radar 
information was available to the skipper of the vincennes capt 
will c rogers iii 
other pentagon officials said wednesday that as a standard 
practice us warships in the gulf monitor three communications 
channels in addition to those used for transmissions among 
themselves 
the channels routinely monitored are a bridgetobridge 
frequency used by civilian and military ship captains a civilian 
distress channel used by ships and planes and a military distress 
channel used by military ships and planes said one official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
there are many many radio frequencies used it would take a 
heck of a lot of people to monitor all of them howard told 
reporters last week 
and on wednesday navy sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said us warships do not monitor the various wavelengths 
used by air traffic controllers 
air traffic control communications may have been monitored by 
the national security agency the government organization that 
collects electronic intelligence however nsa does not publicly 
discuss its activities and it was not clear whether any 
intelligence it gathered would be disclosed along with the results 
of the pentagon investigation officials said 
ships in the us gulf fleet have not been ordered to change 
their routine monitoring nor has additional radio equipment been 
supplied to them since the incident the sources said 
public statements by senior pentagon officials indicate that the 
single vhf monitoring station on the vincennes was used during the 
incident to send warnings to the approaching aircraft 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william j crowe 
jr in a news conference hours after the shootdown said we 
warned him the iran air pilot on the civilian air distress net 
three times in these few minutes and four times on the military 
air distress net 
crowe also said he was not aware of any radio communications 
from the airliner that were intercepted by naval forces in the 
gulf but he said we have contacted airliners before and we have 
had them respond 
the pentagon investigation team headed by rear adm william m 
fogarty has received a computer analysis of the tapes of the 
vincennes electronic system that theoretically will tell them 
whether the cruiser was monitoring iranian air traffic control 
communications us sources in the gulf say 
there are 21 possible tape channels on the ship they can be 
switched to various systems i do not know which systems there were 
recording and which ones were turned on at this particular time 
howard said but it does have the capability to record both 
external communications and internal from station to station

the reagan administration is defending its 
plan to spray us marijuana crops with the highly toxic herbicide 
paraquat which can cause serious harm when inhaled or absorbed by 
humans or animals 
at a news conference wednesday attorney general edwin meese iii 
said the real environmental damage is being done by growers of 
marijuana 
he contended that growers are cutting down trees damming 
streams and pouring pesticides and fertilizer into the water to 
irrigate their crops 
meese said many largescale marijuana growers have moved their 
operations into national forests and other remote areas to avoid 
detection because of the dispersal meese said there are less 
and less places that are good targets for aerial herbicide 
spraying but that whenever we find them were ready to do it 
drug enforcement administration director john lawn said 
paraquat which was banned from use on national forests in 1983 
because of environmental concerns would be one of three herbicides 
used in the current program 
a dea spokesman cornelius dougherty subsequently said that 
paraquat would be used in spraying for marijuana eradication on 
private land not on public property in light of the court ruling 
the other two herbicides cited by lawn 2 4 d and glyphosate 
are not involved in the 1983 federal court decision and could be 
used in spraying on public lands 
an environmental group criticized the use of herbicides in 
general on public lands 
the other two chemicals dont have the same restrictions but 
while that may be complying with the letter of the law it is 
violating the principles that protect national lands to ensure the 
protection of wildlife habitats and recreation areas said jay 
feldman coordinator of the national coalition against the misuse 
of pesticides 
lawn said the government must prepare an environmental impact 
statement when eradication is contemplated and that at that 
point the determination is made by environmentalists by law 
enforcement which chemical will be most effective

some of president reagans most conservative 
followers are saying the nomination of richard thornburgh as 
attorney general points up a disturbing presidential weakness 
the right wing has been frustrated whenever reagan filled a key 
vacancy with someone less dedicated to the conservative cause than 
the person leaving the administration 
the president chose this course again conservative critics say 
when he tapped former the former pennsylvania governor to succeed 
attorney general edwin meese iii 
conservatives including some within the white house itself 
sent letters to white house chief of staff kenneth duberstein 
complaining that reagan effectively abandoned the righttolife 
movement with his thornburgh choice 
thornburgh has a mixed record on that issue in december 1981 
he vetoed an abortion control act saying he objected to sections 
that said life started at conception that mandated a 24hour 
waiting period and that would have established criminal penalties 
for doctors who broke the law 
on june 11 1982 however thornburgh signed a watereddown 
version of the abortion bill which required doctors to notify 
women about the risks of abortion and the availability of medical 
assistance for prenatal care and childbirth portions of the law 
were struck down later by the us supreme court 
an administration official discussing reagans nominations on 
grounds that he not be named publicly said i think that among 
social conservatives around the country there certainly is a 
perception that when key openings occur he has tended to revert 
back to oldline republicans 
reagans chief spokesman marlin fitzwater scoffed at 
suggestions that reagan often picks people more moderate than their 
predecessors 
gov thornburgh is a conservative republican who is known for 
his legal acumen and his strong position on law enforcement he 
said he reagan replaces good people with good people not 
conservatives with liberals 
but sen gordon humphrey rnh wasnt buying that 
he said reagan increasingly has moved to the political center to 
choose people for important jobs and said we see it as 
representing a trend that has accelerated since howard h baker 
jr became reagans chief of staff 
baker of course is no longer at the white house having 
resigned earlier this month to return to private life 
humphrey complained that thornburgh and some other recent reagan 
appointees dont have much of a commitment at all to the social 
side of the reagan agenda i think expediency is the order of 
the day 
the new hampshire conservative also maintained that reagans key 
appointments in the waning months of the administration will be 
unduly influenced by vice president george bush 
i think thornburgh is a bushtype moderate rockefeller 
republican who doesnt give a damn about the social issues that 
are driving the reagan coalition the senator said 
thornburgh has said he will deal with such substantive questions 
in talks with senators but not in the press 
humphrey said he phoned bushs campaign manager lee atwater to 
complain about the thornburgh move saying if that is any 
indication of what were going to get from a bush administration 
then i cant get too enthusiastic 
the administration official said the thornburgh nomination is 
not an isolated incident and noted that after reagans unsuccessful 
bid to put conservative robert h bork on the supreme court the 
president ultimately settled on the more moderate judge anthony m 
kennedy 
i think social conservatives now feel that if we the 
republican party lose the issues of the heart such as abortion 
school prayer and family values the chance of really forming a 
lasting political realignment will be gone he said

ridding the nations nuclear weapons plants of 
contamination will be a monstrous problem but must be done a 
senator said after releasing a study that put the price tag at more 
than 130 billion 
were endangering people on the bases were endangering 
workers were endangering people in surrounding communities 
sen john glenn dohio said wednesday as he released a 
congressional study estimating the cleanup costs 
the 130 billion estimate could jump by an additional 25 
billion if production at the plants is expanded capacity is 
relocated or both the general accounting office study said 
we just have to do this cleanup glenn said its going to 
be monstrous its going to be expensive but we have to do it 
the report which was requested by glenn and released at a 
hearing held by the senate governmental affairs committee comes on 
the heels of cost estimates compiled by the us department of 
energy and made public july 1 
the department said cleaning up contamination and correcting 
other problems at 17 major defense plants could cost between 40 
billion and 70 billion and jump to as high as 110 billion in 
order to maintain standards through the year 2045 
however the gao computed additional costs in its estimates 
including plant improvements and the disposal of radioactive waste 
the installations which are scattered across the country 
produce nuclear materials and weapons for us defense needs 
the gao survey focused on the departments major defense plants 
including the savannah river plant in south carolina the feed 
materials production center and the mound plant both in ohio the 
rocky flats plant in colorado the y12 plant in tennessee hanford 
reservation in washington state the kansas city electronics plant 
the pinellas plant in florida the pantex plant in texas sandia 
and los alamos national laboratories both in new mexico the 
nevada test site idaho national engineering lab and lawrence 
livermore national lab in california 
the gao did not provide a cost breakdown for each installation

after a couple of bumper corn crops and 
relatively low feed prices livestock producers thought they saw 
some daylight ahead but the dark may be closing in again an 
agriculture department report shows 
the drought and sizzling heat of may and june have already 
squeezed livestock producers and could hurt them further if 
conditions persist much longer the departments economic research 
service said wednesday 
rising costs brought on by drought are affecting livestock and 
poultry producers returns the agency said in a new outlook 
summary also poor pasture and range conditions are reducing 
forage supplies for cattle and lamb producers 
the report added if the drought continues hog and cattle 
slaughter may be boosted adding to already record red meat and 
poultry supplies 
market prices of cattle dropped in june following record high 
levels during the spring and likely resulted in part from large 
meat supplies the report said 
feeder cattle prices weakened in response to lower fed cattle 
prices and rising feed costs it said while lower feeder 
cattle prices reduce returns to cowcalf producers the more 
immediate problem is poor pasture and water conditions 
although hay cut from land idled under federal programs has 
helped there will be more pressure to reduce the cattle inventory 
if pastures continue to deteriorate the report said 
total production of red meat and poultry in 1988 is expected to 
rise 3 percent to a record 599 billion pounds but all the gain 
will be from pork lamb and mutton and poultry 
beef production this year was forecast at 229 billion pounds 
down 2 percent from last year 
pork output at 156 billion pounds would be up 9 percent from 
1987 lamb and mutton was shown at 326 million pounds up 6 
percent veal however is expected to decline 5 percent from last 
year to 397 million pounds 
federally inspected poultry production this year was forecast at 
206 billion pounds led by a 4 percent increase in broiler output 
to nearly 162 billion pounds turkey production was forecast at 
389 billion pounds up 4 percent from 1987 
economists said market prices of choicegrade steers at omaha 
neb may average 65 to 69 per 100 pounds of liveweight in the 
third quarter down from 7281 in the second in the fourth 
quarter steer prices may average 68 to 71 per hundredweight 
hog prices at the major markets were forecast at 43 to 47 per 
100 pounds in the third quarter and 37 to 43 in the fourth 
compared with 4590 in the second quarter 
rising poultry prices have more than offset higher feed 
costs the report said wholesale broiler prices are expected 
to average 51 to 54 cents per pound over all of this year up 
from 47 cents in 1987

the soviet union has bought an additional 
150000 metric tons of us corn for delivery this year under a 
longterm supply agreement between the two countries says the 
agriculture department 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 150000 tons of 
corn would be about 59 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 270 per bushel at the 
farm level meaning that the sale reported wednesday could have a 
farm value of around 16 million 
the corn is part of the grain the soviet union is committed to 
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement which calls 
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of us grain 
the pact expires sept 30 
according to the agreement the annual purchases are supposed to 
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn the 
soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as 
wheat corn or soybeans with every ton of beans counting as two 
tons of grain up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain 
equivalent 
with the latest purchases the soviets now have bought 504 
million tons of corn plus more than 9 million tons of wheat 
830700 tons of soybeans and 13 million tons of soybean meal

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan is 
talking tough about using higher interest rates to fight inflation 
but many economists doubt the tough talk will be followed with much 
action 
these analysts believe the central bank with an eye on the 
november presidential election has done all the credit tightening 
it intends for a while 
for this reason they are looking for interest rates to stay 
about where they are currently in coming months that would be good 
news for the housing industry as mortgage rates level off and it 
would mean consumers and businesses may be spared another jump in 
the prime lending rate 
greenspan delivering his midyear report on fed monetary policy 
to congress on wednesday issued some stern warnings about rising 
inflationary threats in the economy singling out tight labor 
markets rising import prices and the droughts effect on grain 
prices as particularly worrisome 
he said the central bank had already made a series of credit 
tightening moves from late march through late june in an effort 
to keep inflation in check 
the costs to our economy and society of allowing a more 
intense inflationary process to become entrenched are serious 
greenspan said 
but greenspan also suggested that the credittightening which 
has occurred may be enough to dampen inflationary pressures because 
of an expected moderation in growth in the second half of 1988 
greenspan said that factory utilization rates could well top 
out soon and he also predicted that the unemployment rate which 
has fallen dramatically this year would level off both of those 
developments would be seen as easing inflationary pressures 
in response to a question greenspan said he did not think that 
further increases in interest rates were inevitable especially if 
current inflationary pressures begin to ease 
there had been widespead expectations that the fed would soon 
move to nudge interest rates higher especially since the 
unemployment rate fell to a 14year low of 53 percent in june 
but many analysts said greenspans comments seemed to indicate 
that the central bank is satisfied that it has done enough for now 
beginning in late march the fed initiated a series of 
credittightening moves by reducing the amount of money banks have 
to make loans those efforts have pushed a key interest rate the 
rate banks charge each other for overnight loans up by a full 
percentage point 
that in turn triggered an increase in the prime lending rate to 
9 percent in may and sent mortgage rates which had dropped below 
10 percent up to a current level of 1038 percent 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co a new 
york securities dealer said he believed rates would hold steady at 
these levels in coming months 
greenspan feels he has taken the appropriate tightening steps 
and that will be enough to cool off demand growth in the second 
half of the year jones said 
greenspan believes the economy will not be that strong in the 
second half and that you shouldnt tighten credit conditions with 
an economy slowing considerably said michael evans head of a 
washington consulting firm 
david wyss chief financial economist at data resources inc 
predicted that the federal reserve would keep its head low during 
the election campaign and will avoid its strongest tightening 
move a boost in the discount rate it charges on money it loans to 
member banks 
many analysts believe that greenspan and the other members of 
the federal reserves board of governors all appointed by 
president reagan would try to keep the economy on an even keel in 
an effort to promote george bushs presidential chances 
but some senators at the hearing expressed concern that 
greenspan and the fed had already overdone the efforts at 
tightening credit conditions and had raised the risk of a recession 
next year 
i would come down on the side of avoiding a recession almost 
at all costs sen james sasser dtenn lectured greenspan i 
do hope the fed would not be hypersensitive to signs real or 
imagined of inflation

momentum is building in congress to protect a 
hallowed civil war battleground from a massive shopping center 
complex that a developer wants to build next door 
the house interior and insular affairs committee approved a 
measure wednesday authorizing the federal government to seize a 
542acre tract next to the manassas national battlefield park 
the bill a combination of legislation introduced by rep frank 
wolf rva and another bill sponsored by reps michael andrews 
dtexas and robert mrazek dny now moves to the house floor 
after passing the committee by a 2711 vote supporters hope the 
matter will come up for a vote when the house reconvenes after the 
democratic national convention 
critics of the measure including rep ron marlenee rmont 
complained that the bill was too costly but it was approved after 
the panel defeated an amendment offered by marlenee that would have 
added 11000 acres to the custer battlefield national monument 
near billings mont 
the house committee vote came one day after a 106 billion 
transportation bill passed by the senate included a provision to 
block any federal money from being used for highway construction 
associated with the proposed william center development 
a similar measure had already been included in transportation 
legislation approved by the house and supporters of the provision 
predict it will survive final legislative changes made by house and 
senate members 
congress entered the domain of local zoning officials after 
historians and preservationists complained that the massive 
development would destroy the rural sanctity of the 4600acre park 
where two important civil war battles took place 
developer john t hazel seeks to build a complex including 12 
million square feet of retail space 17 million square feet of 
office space and 560 homes he bought the property in 1985 and 
first proposed a smallscale office park for the site then 
expanded his plans to the current concept once prince william 
county va officials relaxed zoning restrictions on the property 
the park is the site of the first and second battles of 
manassas which were both confederate victories

two nuclear plants in new york and nebraska 
with good performance records are being added to the list of the 
nations worst because of concerns that their operators cant 
handle things that arent routine 
by the same token good performance in the face of the 
unexpected has led the staff of the nuclear regulatory commission 
to take a colorado plant off the list 
at the nine mile point no 1 plant in scriba ny the 
principal areas of concern are the ability of the 
organization to identify problems correct them and implement 
successful solutions said william kane regional director of 
reactor programs in a briefing for the commission on wednesday 
at the fort calhoun plant in nebraska the staff concerns have 
to do not with the operating performance of the plant which sets 
records and operates exceedingly well but with the depth of 
their ability to withstand complex challenge when it occurs said 
robert martin regional administrator based in arlington texas 
the listing now 16 reactors at 10 sites means the plants get 
special surveillance and the owners generally have to show they can 
operate safely 
special concern is no longer warranted for the fort st vrain 
plant public service co of colorado near denver which has 
suffered frequent breakdowns since it was built in 1979 the staff 
said 
over the last six months their performance has demonstrated 
to us a good approach to the handling of issues said martin 
the new york plant on lake ontario is 19 years old and before 
being forced out of service last december by feedwater problems 
had recently run for 420 days without a shutdown 
this long run could have made the owner niagara mohawk power 
corp complacent the staff said 
company spokesman william romano said niagara is not disputing 
the staffs conclusions and is working closely with it to solve 
problems of leadership and morale and get the plant restarted 
martin said the nebraska plant sets records and operates 
exceedingly well but seems to lack engineering strength 
systems to critically review and look at the work they are doing 
omaha public power district president fred petersen said in a 
statement the district had acknowledged problems but believes fort 
calhoun is one of the best nuclear plants in the united states 
we are committed to improving that record however and the 
expertise of the nrc staff will have a positive effect in our 
efforts in this regard 
a good response to challenge is one reason the colorado plant no 
longer needs special supervision said martin inspections have 
shown a good operational work ethic martin said 
we think its wonderful said company spokeswoman kim 
devigil we have finally begun to work out some of the kinks and 
get over some of the hurdles we had in our technology being one of 
a kind we didnt have somebody we could go to and say hey what 
did you guys do 
the fort st vrain plant is the only one in the united states 
using graphite to slow the neutrons that cause nuclear fission and 
helium to carry away the heat it produces

star wars antimissile defenses in orbit could 
be used as a cover for nuclear weapons capable of hitting targets 
on earth on five minutes notice a soviet general says in a rare 
interview 
maj gen boris surikov said star wars devices which the 
soviets call space strike weapons could in the foreseeable 
future be used to destroy strategically important targets on earth 
and in space 
the current technology also gives the opportunity to start 
cover deployment of spacetoearth strike weapons even now he 
said in the interview published wednesday by the british magazine 
janes defence weekly 
independently of the actual armaments of the us 
antiballistic missiles stations the soviet union would assume 
that they are armed with weapons able to destroy vital ground 
targets within five minutes of a decision to mount a nuclear attack 
from space he said 
surikov also outlined steps the soviets could take to outflank 
star wars formally known as the strategic defense initiative 
although soviet civilians and us critics of star wars have 
made points similar to surikovs the interview provided unusual 
detail from a soviet military source that janes described as his 
governments expert on new types and systems of spacebased 
weapons 
surikov hinted in the article that the soviet union might 
destroy such stations soon after they were deployed 
us officials have denied that star wars would use nuclear 
weapons or that other sdi devices such as highenergy lasers 
would be used against targets on earth 
congress has barred the reagan administration from spending any 
money that might violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
which places strict limits on missile defenses 
surikov acknowledged that the soviet union is engaged in 
research and development to improve the limited abm system around 
moscow he said the system was fully in compliance with article 
vii of the abm treaty limiting each side to one abm site 
equipped with not more than 100 interceptors 
he also confirmed that the soviet union is conducting research 
on new weapons systems based on other physical principles such 
as lasers at a test site allowed under the abm pact 
the article appeared as the reagan administration tries to 
decide whether to declare the soviet union in material breach 
of the abm treaty because it built a radar facility at krasnoyarsk 
deep inside siberia instead of near the border as required by the 
pact 
the soviets say the krasnoyarsk radar is designed to track 
vehicles in space but suspended work on it a year ago before it 
became operational 
surikov did not directly respond to us allegations about the 
facility but said all soviet radars have lower potentials than 
the ceiling set in the abm treaty and cannot detect or track 
ballistic missiles automatically or with the necessary accuracy 
the soviet general also outlined steps that moscow could take to 
foil any strategic defense system built by the united states the 
countermeasures all of which have been discussed publicly by 
western experts include 
early destruction or neutralization of orbiting stations by 
antiabm spacecraft armed with nuclear or conventional charges 
space mines or clouds of heavy or lightweight obstacles like 
metal balls sawdust sand etc 
a buildup of offensive arms to present sdi with an 
overwhelming number of intercontinental ballistics missiles icbms 
to target 
cheap icbm decoys which would greatly overburden the 
first space layer of the abm defense and other imitation 
devices to effectively camouflage the real nuclear warheads 
high acceleration missiles designed to release their 
warheads before the launch vehicle could be destroyed by the first 
layer of a spacebased defense 
massive deployment of variously based cruise missiles or 
submarine launched ballistic missiles for which there are no 
interceptors at present

lloyd bentsen was returning to his customary 
senate duties today after a first full day of campaignstyle 
appearances with his new political partner democratic presidential 
nomineetobe michael dukakis 
at a news conference on wednesday bentsen looked relaxed and 
comfortable in his dayold role as dukakis running mate with the 
massachusetts governor at his side bentsen minimized his 
differences with dukakis on such issues as abortion funding contra 
aid and the reagan tax cuts 
on the vast majority of issues from jobs to health care to 
education we share a common cause the texas senator said 
on wednesday bentsen skipped a finance committee meeting to 
make the political rounds with dukakis today though he was 
presiding as committee chairman at a hearing on the uscanada 
free trade agreement 
bentsen won a warm bipartisan tribute from his senate colleagues 
wednesday night as he entered the chamber for a roll call 
republican leader bob dole of kansas spotted him and said id 
like to extend my congratulations to sen bentsen from this side 
of the aisle 
the senators present republicans and democrats alike rose to 
their feet and burst into applause bentsen grinned and waved 
bentsen was asked wednesday at his capitol hill news conference 
with dukakis about his plans to run for reelection to his senate 
seat as well as the vice presidency in november 
i cant get off the ticket in texas thats the way the law is 
written he said if i was to step off the ticket that would 
forfeit it to the republican challenger and i cant do that 
at the news conference bentsen laughed off a question about 
whether his age 67 was prohibitive and challenged his 
questioner sam donaldson of abc to a tennis match 
bentsen said his 94yearold father goes to work every morning 
by 6 oclock works six days a week drives his own car and has a 
fuzzbuster on the dash he hastened to add that in texas such 
radardetection devices are legal 
earlier bentsen got a chilly reception at the naacp convention 
where some delegates booed when dukakis introduced the running mate 
he choose over jesse jackson naacp executive director benjamin l 
hooks intervened to cajole the delegates into offering bentsen a 
warmer hand 
bentsen told the naacp that for all who are commited to 
justice and equality indifference is simply not an option in 1988 
if you care about the makeup of the civil rights commission 
or the composition of the supreme court or ther leadership of 
the justice department or about equality and progress in jobs and 
schools i think you have to vote for michael dukakis said 
bentsen 
its important not just for the naacp not just for black 
americans but for all who care about freedom and opportunity for 
all who believe that government can be a force for fairness for 
all who believe in the politics of inclusion he said 
mike dukakis and i are committed to making a difference for 
america and we need your help said bentsen 
bentsen said he talked by telephone with jackson earlier 
wednesday 
jesse jackson is a friend of mine hes a very able gentleman 
and i wanted to establish communications with him and that i did 
and i think we had a very good conversation he said 
bentsen once expressed puzzlement that lyndon johnson was 
willing to give up his powerful senate post to become vice 
president asked why in light of that he accepted dukakis offer 
bentsen said he was convinced that i could be a trusted adviser 
to the next president of the united states and thats one of the 
major responsibilities that a public official can fill 
bentsen and dukakis were traveling to texas for a rally together 
on sunday the day before the opening of the democratic national

mayor eugene sawyer consolidated his power with a 
shakeup of committee chairmanships wednesday night during a raucous 
city council meeting at which an opponent said sawyer declared 
war in the black community 
with sawyers blessing his allies stripped his top political 
rival in the black community alderman timothy evans of 
chairmanship of the finance committee and dumped at least three 
other black aldermen out of key posts 
the reorganization was adopted on a vote of 2617 with sawyer 
who is black relying on votes from white aldermen 
opponents of the mayor most of them black said the realignment 
would add fuel to evans probable mayoral run in 1989 
only 15 months ago black aldermen were united when the late 
mayor harold washington the citys first black mayor was 
reelected but since washingtons death last november and 
sawyers elevation from alderman to acting mayor black political 
figures have divided their allegiance between sawyer and evans 
mr mayor i think youve made a terrible mistake said 
alderman danny davis a black who lost chairmanship of the zoning 
committee it looks like everything we fought for that harold 
washington died for is being turned back 
what we have seen is an evil sinister plot added davis 
himself mentioned as a possible mayoral candidate its a dark 
day in the city of chicago i guess you and your colleagues have 
declared war in the black community 
but alderman michael sheahan a white sawyer supporter said the 
mayor was trying for a real balanced reorganization 
if sawyer did not reorganize sheahan said thats 
surrendering 
sawyer said he had to act to move the city ahead 
we have an agenda to move a city to run he said they 
have another agenda and its not mine 
as part of the council committee reshuffling alderman larry 
bloom a white opponent of sawyer who has his own mayoral 
ambitions lost chairmanship of the budget committee to alderman 
lemuel austin a sawyer supporter 
the housing committee formerly chaired by sawyer opponent 
alderman dorothy tillman was turned over to alderman sheneather 
butler 
the meeting was punctuated by protests from the gallery as 
various aldermen rose to defend or criticize the committee 
reassignments at one point near the end of the meeting police 
officers rushed to the floor to break up a nearfight between ms 
tillman and alderman marlene carter 
many of the audience members shouted go home uncle tom to 
some of the black aldermen who defended the purge 
a special election is scheduled next april to fill the final two 
years of washingtons fouryear term sawyer has said he will run 
and evans has all but declared his own candidacy

a twoyear struggle between management and 
employees of the washington post has taken a new turn with a union 
representing the papers workers alleging that the post 
discriminates against women minorities and older workers 
the washingtonbaltimore newspaper guild which represents 1400 
reporters editors and business department workers at the post 
filed a discrimination complaint with the district of columbia 
office of human rights on wednesday 
the union alleges that women and minorities have been treated 
unfairly in pay and promotion decisions and charges that the post 
has steered older highersalaried reporters and editors toward 
retirement 
those charges were quickly denied by post officials 
the post doesnt discriminate against any of its employees 
said bo jones legal counsel for the washington post cos 
salaries are based on individual merit 
post reporters make an average of 55000 per year he said 
the districts human rights office which has subpoena power 
over wage hiring and promotional records cannot force the post to 
make changes in its procedures but could freeze various city funds 
and services the newspaper enjoys if it rules that the union 
complaint has merit such a finding would also strengthen any civil 
lawsuit the union might file against the paper 
we dont think its too much to ask for this great newspaper 
to investigate charges of discrimination in its own backyard 
said jill nelson an editor on the papers sunday magazine who 
serves as the papers union representative 
the guilds complaint was filed on the second day of a protest 
in which most post reporters withheld bylines from their stories to 
draw attention to a lack of progress in contract negotiations 
employees at the paper have been working without a contract for two 
years 
the major contract dispute has been over a wage agreement 
reached in the 1970s that gave incumbent reporters hefty pay raises 
but did not accordingly adjust wage levels for future newcomers 
the union charges that merit pay increases over which union 
officials have no control have been used to further separate new 
white male reporters and editors from their black and female 
counterparts 
jones said the post has been working diligently to increase the 
number of minorities and women in all departments but 
acknowledged among reporters for example you dont have many 
blacks coming in at the david broder level 
if you look at salary levels at individual levels youll find 
whites make more than blacks among reporters jones said but 
if you look at guildcovered editors blacks make more than 
whites 
the union claims black female reporters at the post earn an 
average of 170 less per week than their white male colleagues 
even when age and experience are taken into account according to 
figures compiled by the union white male employees also enjoy 
better pay rates than white female workers and other minorities 
the union also charged that the posts percentage of minority 
employees is insufficient while jones claimed that 16 percent of 
newsroom staff is made up of minorities and 26 percent of new 
hires in the past two years have been black hiring of females also 
has tailed off in recent years the union charged

a new trade bill that has been stripped of a 
plantclosings notification feature is headed for the senate amid 
predictions that president reagan will sign it barring major 
changes 
republican leader robert h michel rill said through an aide 
after the house approved the measure 37645 on wednesday that the 
president will definitely sign it provided the senate does not 
drastically alter the bill 
he really has to sign it otherwise he will cause political 
problems for the republican party rep robert matsui 
dcalif said after the bill won its strongest house support in 
two years of seesaw combat over the issue 
only four democrats and 41 republicans held out against the bill 
reagan vetoed an earlier version may 24 and within hours the 
house voted 308113 to pass it over the presidents objections it 
had cleared 312107 in april in its best showing until wednesday 
senate efforts to pass the measure over reagans opposition 
failed june 8 to get the twothirds needed for a veto override 
since then however lawmakers have dropped a provision that 
would require companies to give employees 60day notice of 
impending plant closings and largescale layoffs reagan singled 
out the provision in his veto message saying it would rob managers 
of the flexibility to maintain their firms in peak economic health 
sponsors called notification humane and decent 
in another move to meet reagans objections the house deleted 
curbs on export of alaska oil that were contained in the bill 
before taking up the trade bill the house approved the 
plantclosings notification plan 286136 as a separate piece of 
legislation and will now send that senatepassed measure to the 
presidents desk 
in another preliminary move the house rejected 237183 a michel 
effort to drop features providing dutyfree imports of ethanol 
produced at caribbean refineries from european and brazilian 
alcoholbased products including wine 
the bill would overhaul the system under which the united states 
imposes import restrictions to protect us industries and 
retaliate against international trade violations 
there would be sanctions against toshiba corp of japan and 
kongsberg vaapenfabrikk of norway for selling submarinesilencing 
technology to the soviet union 
depending on the outcome of the uruguay round of international 
trade negotiations and other factors the measure could generate 
more than 2 billion in agricultural subsidies 
the 1980 windfall profits tax on oil company earnings would be 
repealed the measure would authorize 980 million in the fiscal 
year starting oct 1 and more funds later for retraining of workers 
left jobless by plant closings layoffs and other disruptions 
whether or not they were traderelated 
a vast array of other features can be found in the 1000page 
document that has been wending its way through capitol hill in one 
form or another since the trade debate started hearing up in 1984 
the reason at that time was record trade deficits and related 
job losses in industries hard hit by competition from imports 
since then the situation has changed unemployment is at a 14year 
low of 53 percent and the monthly trade deficit has been sinking

house and senate leaders are presenting 
similar versions of what they say is longoverdue acid rain 
legislation that stands a good chance of passing this year 
for seven years we have supported legislation to control acid 
rain sen george mitchell dmaine said at a news conference 
wednesday to announce a tentative acid rain plan agreed to by 27 
senators three times in this decade the committee on environment 
and public works has reported such legislation but thus far 
the legislation has not been considered in the senate 
on the other side of the capitol rep sherwood boehlert 
rny was joined by ohio gov richard celeste new york gov 
mario cuomo and three ohio congressmen when he announced 
legislation patterned after a compromise reached by the two 
governors last month 
both plans call for a 10millionton reduction in sulfur dioxide 
emissions from old coalfired utility plants as compared to a 
12millionton reduction called for in amendments to the clean air 
act now stalled in the senate the boehlert bill would give 
utilities 15 years to comply while the senate plan gives them 12 
figuring that it will cost about 18 billion a year to reduce 
emissions the boehlert bill proposes that polluters pay half that 
cost the oil industry pay 650 million a year through fees to the 
federal government for oil storage and the federal government pay 
the remaining 250 million annually 
the senate measure suggests a costsharing effort tied to the 
amount of electricity generated but giving credit to those states 
that have already implemented acid rain controls 
the senate measure is not yet in the form of a bill but 
mitchell said it probably would be introduced as an amendment to an 
appropriate legislative vehicle he refused to be more specific 
in terms of timing we rule nothing in or out he said we 
will do it at the time that seems most opportune for advancing this 
legislation 
he said he would drop efforts to get a vote on the existing 
amendments to the clean air act stalled in the senate since last 
november 
he also said he did not anticipate the usual roadblocks to acid 
rain legislation such as the opposition of rep john dingell 
dmich who has protected interests of his states auto industry 
or senate majority leader robert byrd dwva who represents a 
large coalmining state 
from the standpoint of an opponent this may be a very 
opportune time to act mitchell said noting that both apparent 
presidential candidates have voiced support for acid rain 
legislation 
byrd is studying the plan but as of this time we do not have 
the support of sen byrd mitchell noted 
several senators expressed reservation about costsharing 
details of which are still being worked out 
i firmly believe that polluters should pay to clean up their 
dirty facilities sen gordon j humphrey rnh said i 
endorse this new approach to acid rain control which includes a 
costsharing proposal in the hope that this compromise may finally 
have what it takes to enact effective acid rain controls 
but sen edward markey dmass called the plan the fairest 
way costwise he estimated that in western states utility 
customers might see another 30 cents to 40 cents on their monthly 
bills while in a state like massachusetts people might expect to 
pay another 80 cents 
for the most part the legislators were upbeat about the chances 
of passing a bill now that ohio and new york have put forward a 
solution 
every passing day brings another indication that congress is 
serious about meeting its responsibilities to act on acid rain 
cuomo said today youve seen two very big indications 
sulfur dioxide emissions from the burning of coal have been 
blamed as a major cause of acid rain which environmentalists say 
is destroying waters and woodlands in the northeast much of the 
sulfur dioxide comes from coalburning power plants along the ohio 
river

needy new york state students will begin 
getting a guaranteed free public college education beginning in 
1991 under a program agreed to wednesday by gov mario cuomo and 
legislative leaders 
under the liberty scholarship program students entering a new 
york college in fall 1991 whose families have a gross adjusted 
income of 18000 or less would be given a scholarship worth the 
difference between other grants they receive and their full college 
costs including such things as books and transportation 
the value of the scholarship would be geared to the average 
tuition costs at state university of new york schools but would be 
available for students who chose to go instead to private colleges 
in new york 
that means that if a student was eligible for a 4000 liberty 
scholarship and decided to go to a private college where the annual 
costs were 15000 the student would still only get a 4000 
scholarship 
we believe this is the most comprehensive and first program of 
its kind in the united states said cuomo press secretary gary 
fryer 
when first proposed by cuomo earlier this year the liberty 
scholarship idea was questioned by some legislators who said their 
middleclass constituents might not look kindly on it cuomo said 
that those who opposed it were being selfish 
the program is expected to be approved by the legislature before 
it ends it regular session possibly as early as the end of this 
week 
the liberty scholarships a key cuomo initiative this year 
would be available at a reduced level for students from families 
with annual incomes up to 26000 fryer said about 94000 
scholarships would be awarded when the program is fully implemented

a team investigating why an 18foot section of an 
airplane ripped off in flight said wednesday a number of 
discrepancies in aloha airlines records indicated problems with 
aircraft were noted but no record was made of corrections 
lonnie r giles leader of a federal aviation administration 
inspection team said alohas structural inspection program and its 
compliance with faa airworthiness directives were reviewed in a 
special inspection in may 
the review followed the april 28th incident in which a portion 
of the fuselage on a boeing 737 peeled off on a flight from hilo to 
honolulu exposing the firstclass section to the open air at 
24000 feet 
the pilot and copilot managed to land the crippled jet 13 
minutes later in maui although one of the two engines quit a 
flight attendant died in the accident 
the national transportation safety board heard testimony 
wednesday about two faa reports critical of alohas maintenance 
operations 
in one example the faa inspection team said a jan 5 aloha 
document described two rivets being popped on a window post of a 
737 
the documents corrective action section is stamped inspected 
and determined ok for further service transcribed for further 
rework 
the faa report said the missing rivet item again appeared on a 
jan 15 aloha document with an additional note that the window 
must be removed the same document also described missing 
fasteners just behind the window post 
the faa report said neither of the discrepancy reports showed 
any corrective actions and when the faa inspected the aircraft on 
may 9 inspectors noted the rivets were still missing 
henry arii aloha vice president of quality control and 
assurance said in an interview that in all such instances cited 
interim repairs were made to keep the planes airworthy until the 
problems could be permanently fixed he said that because aloha 
used a unique system for tracking repairs the faa did not realize 
the temporary repairs had been made 
the airplane in question was taken out of service in the spring 
the faa report did not specify the exact date 
aloha spokesman milton goto said the plane in question was 
rebuilt inspected and returned to service 
the faa team said alohas recordkeeping system for compliance 
with faa airworthiness directives lacked continuity and consistency 
airworthiness directives are orders by the faa to inspect and 
correct problems in aircraft 
the paper trace to determine actual method of compliance was 
very difficult and timeconsuming the faa report said 
however the report said that after much diligent and tedious 
research the team found satisfactory evidence of compliance with 
the directives 
a separate faa team inspected alohas maintenance program in 
december as part of a national aviation safety program that looked 
at a number of airlines 
the faas dec 21 report found among other things maintenance 
officials at aloha had been remiss in their responsibilities by 
not being able to recognize their own deficiencies 
the faa said maintenance managers were asked to furnish 
information about alohas aircraft maintenance reliability program 
the end result was the reliability documents requested could 
not be furnished because they are nonexistent according to the 
report 
in an april 21 update the faa team said aloha had submitted a 
new reliability program and acted to correct other problems found 
in the inspection 
the ntsb inquiry board also questioned faa officials about 
whether they should put more emphasis on handson aircraft 
inspections rather than reviewing airline maintenance documents 
in looking for possible problems 
we do review a lot of paperwork giles said i try to 
temper mine with a lot of onsite inspection 
giles acknowledged theres not necessarily a correlation between 
wellkept documents and wellkept aircraft to get a good 
complete picture you have to look at both 
each carrier has the primary responsibility for ensuring its 
planes are safe but giles said that he personally has grounded 
planes he thought unairworthy

jamboree day camp director kay morris has forgotten the first year 
of the long split but remembers the length 
we started with 50 feet and have increased it every year 
she said we try to break our old record each year 
camp staffers created the split wednesday along a foilcovered 
gutter using 45 gallons of ice cream three three gallons of 
chocolate syrup two gallons of cherries 15 cans of whipped cream 
and a case of bananas 
because of the number of staffers involved the concoctions 
creation took only 10 minutes its consumption took the cubs a 
little longer 
im eating like a pig said 6yearold john starks of fort 
smith his face covered and his hair matted with ice cream and 
chocolate sauce he explained that after losing his spoon in the 
giant treat he bent over the ice cream and used his mouth moments

fluffy white tissue which ended a muchdiscussed drought of the 
restroom item

clerk billy cooper who last week dug into his own pocket to buy 
tissue for paperdepleted restrooms 
the countys supply of toilet tissue dried up last week because 
the product was temporarily outofstock at the jackson firm that 
holds the stateapproved contract for twoply toilet tissue

polish television has served viewers a 
full menu of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs encounters with 
eager crowds of poles who offer flowers or urge him to autograph a 
copy of his book 
but the gatherings are less spontaneous than they seem 
flower merchant jozefa paslawska pointed to the four copies of 
the book perestroika on soviet reforms prominently displayed 
in front of her flowers 
it will be a big souvenir when he signs it she said 
ms paslawska did not show up on the krakow market square 
tuesday by accident 
like the rest of the hundreds of poles who closed in on 
gorbachev when he emerged from a sumptuous lunch in the freshly 
painted wierzynek restaurant in the southern city her presence had 
been carefully planned 
according to protocol polish security has the upper hand in 
arranging gorbachevs safety during the sixday visit which began 
monday 
in doing so it has also made sure poles who might raise 
solidarity banners or flash the twofingered v sign of the 
banned free trade union movement are kept far from gorbachev 
as a result the spontaneous meetings are artificial 
the desire to avoid incidents that might embarrass communist 
authorities was evident in krakow which has an active branch the 
prosolidarity independent students union and where workers in 
nearby nowa huta went on strike in april during polands worst 
labor unrest since a 1981 military crackdown suspended solidarity 
blueuniformed police began emptying krakows medieval market 
square one of europes largest and blocked the small streets 
leading to the square six hours before gorbachev arrived on tuesday 
those allowed to cross police barriers had special invitations 
from their factories when the soviet leader toured the square 
plainclothesmen with special blueandwhite badges locked arms and 
formed a second barrier in addition to gorbachevs regular guards 
the civilian guards ringed the entrance to st marys roman 
catholic church which gorbachev visited for about 20 minutes even 
preselected guests were bumped back by the guards 
polish government spokesman jerzy urban said the tight control 
was necessary to avoid traffic snarls 
the places gorbachev visits have been carefully chosen for their 
symbolic value 
on wednesday he visited the warski shipyard in the baltic port 
of szczecin a former solidarity stronghold 
the 3000 workers who heared him speak were required to have an 
invitation from their place of work and only about a third actually 
worked at the shipyard the workers showed little enthusiasm when 
gorbachev spoke 
not all the situations were artificial 
outside the lenin museum in poronin a southern mountain village 
where soviet founder vladimir lenin spent several summers before 
world war i gorbachev spoke to a crowd that included casually 
dressed vacationers 
security even allowed a little boy with a camera to run around 
and inspect the impressive fleet of black limousines that powered 
the gorbachev party up the winding hills to poronin on tuesday 
however the crowd allowed to watch gorbachev lay a wreath in 
front of a statue of lenin inside the museum consisted of local 
party officials and the local military honor guard 
not all those privileged to see gorbachev were impressed 
merchants in krakows market square complained that their 
flowers had wilted for lack of customers 
and a group of east german tourists who accidentally found 
themselves on the square did not stay for a glimpse of gorbachev 
he has his picture taken and taken but he never does 
anything said one before the group trouped off

in the waning hours of michael dukakis search for 
a running mate it came down to two john glenn and lloyd bentsen 
and both in dukakis mind had the right stuff 
the two senators each offered washington experience either 
would bring ideological and geographical balance to the democratic 
ticket both have moderate to conservative voting records and both 
are well respected in congress 
glenn the ohio senator the astronaut and hero likely would 
deliver his states 23 electoral college votes to dukakis bentsen 
the silverhaired texas senator the quintessential washington 
insider might help carry his states 29 electoral votes 
on the negative side neither is considered a dazzling 
campaigner both had made unsuccessful presidential bids bentsens 
a shortlived venture in 1976 and glenns a failed 1984 effort 
marked by wellpublicized disarray and a huge remaining debt 
as dukakis prepared to make his choice monday night sources 
said the focus essentially had narrowed to glenn and bentsen but 
rep lee hamilton of indiana and to a lesser degree sen albert 
gore jr of tennessee were still in contention 
stacked up against glenn bentsen emerged as the victor based on 
his senate record and the strategic implications of his inclusion 
on the ticket sources said winning out over the heroic legacy of 
the ohioan most had considered the favorite for the democratic vice 
presidential nomination 
dukakis aides also believe he is already a strong contender in 
the midwest and that the key to the election is attracting reagan 
democrats back to the party 
as part of the detailed background checks directed by dukakis 
confidant paul brountas the campaign had compiled an unimpressive 
portrait of the 1984 glenn presidential effort which was in 
serious trouble even before iowas allimportant caucuses several 
people involved in that campaign live in the boston area and were 
easily accessible to the brountas research team 
with dukakis his wife brountas and two top campaign aides 
assembled at dukakis kitchen table the unanimous choice was 
bentsen 
if the pick is between two near equals why not take the one 
that causes george bush the most grief offered one senior 
dukakis adviser bush claims texas as his home state and the 
choice of bentsen by dukakis was a deliberate effort to force bush 
to invest time and money in a state he may have taken for granted 
bentsen as senate finance committee chairman plays a leading 
role in the chambers handling of major legislation and this year 
alone has been a key figure in the consideration of trade and 
catastrophic health care bills 
both had the stature we were looking for but bentsen is more 
of a doer has more accomplishments another adviser said that 
was appealing to michael 
dukakis said from the outset of the search that his vice 
president would be an active player and trusted adviser and 
bentsen was seen in the dukakis camp as fitting that role better 
than glenn 
dukakis himself hinted at that when explaining on wednesday why 
he picked bentsen to fill the ticket 
i picked this man because in my judgment he had those 
qualities the strength character the values the experience that 
would be most helpful not just in running and winning but in 
serving in office and putting together as fine an administration as 
we possibly could dukakis told a capitol hill news conference 
the choice of bentsen also was partly attributed to the 
withdrawal of two attractive candidates from consideration georgia 
sen sam nunn and new jersey sen bill bradley 
with nunn out of the running speculation about a running mate 
from the south turned to bentsen gore and florida sen bob graham 
graham sources said did not have the washington and national 
political experience dukakis sought and gore would proven a 
sensitive choice because jackson was pushing for the no 2 spot and 
had outlasted gore in the presidential primaries 
that problem also dimmed the prospects of missouri rep richard 
gephardt 
jackson has no government experience and his flamboyant 
personality clashes with dukakis reserved nature he was never 
considered a serious vice presidential possibility and the boston 
globe reported wednesday that he hurt his already dim chances by 
refusing to fully comply with brountas request for financial 
information 
hamilton like bradley developed a good rapport with dukakis 
and some believe dukakis would have turned to the indiana 
congressman if there was division over the bentsenglenn choice

michael dukakis sought wednesday to emphasize 
the economic issues of jobs and growth he and his vice presidential 
choice sen lloyd bentsen of texas agree on but the two men 
differ on a range of other issues 
among them 
nicaragua bentsen like many southern democrats has 
consistently voted in favor of the reagan administrations requests 
to provide military aid to the contra rebels fighting nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government he has said he believes force is the 
only way to pressure managua into making democratic reforms 
dukakis opposes contra aid instead preferring diplomatic solutions 
to nicaraguas political problems 
reaganomics bentsen as a member of the taxwriting senate 
finance committee supported president reagans successful 1981 
cuts in individual income taxes i really thought taxes should be 
cut bentsen said wednesday adding that concerns about a 
mounting federal deficit had prompted him to vote against the third 
and final increment of the tax cut dukakis has termed the cuts a 
disgrace that led to huge deficits and damaged the us trade 
balance 
oil as an oilstate lawmaker bentsen has consistently sought 
preferential tax treatment for the petroleum industry and has 
favored an oil import fee positions diametrically at odds with 
attitudes in the oilconsuming northeast and with dukakis stance 
school prayer bentsen has voted in favor of a constitutional 
amendment to allow organized prayer in public schools dukakis 
opposes it 
weapons bentsen has supported the modernization of the us 
strategic force including votes for the b1 bomber and the mx 
missile dukakis opposes both weapons systems 
balanced budget bentsen voted for a constitutional amendment 
requiring congress to adopt a balanced budget every year except in 
wartime or if threefifths of members approve of waiving the 
requirement dukakis opposes such an amendment 
death penalty bentsen generally supports imposition of the 
death penalty and has voted for it in the senate dukakis is 
opposed to the death penalty

senate approval of a 10 billion spending bill 
for the interior department is being greeted with the threat of a 
presidential veto because of what the white house budget office 
says is excessive spending 
the 924 vote however was far more than the twothirds tally 
needed to override a veto the senate bill exceeds reagans budget 
request by 12 billion and would boost current spending by 7476 
million 
the measure now goes to a housesenate conference committee 
which will reconcile differences with a 969 billion version of 
the bill approved by the house on june 29 for fiscal 1989 which 
begins oct 1 
james miller director of the office of management and budget 
sent word he will recommend that president reagan veto the bill 
unless his objections are resolved 
miller complained of excessive spending under the senate bill 
for 526 million worth of energy conservation grants land 
acquisition construction projects and indian health facilities 
miller also protested the measures proposed oneyear moratorium 
on sale of oil and gas leases off the coasts of northern california 
and massachusetts and resumption of such a ban off the florida gulf 
coast 
the chamber also approved an amendment by sen bennett johnston 
dla eliminating a provision that would have accelerated by six 
months to aug 1 1989 a southern california lease sale involving 
7 million acres of shoreline 
environmentalists had opposed that provision because of the 
senate appropriations committees declaration that environmental 
impact statements prepared for previous lease sales in the area 
should be considered sufficient for this sale 
the senate voted to provide 525 million to support a reagan 
commitment to canada to combat acid rain by developing technology 
to reduce polluting emissions from coal burning 
miller had complained that the house backtracked on a 
congressional commitment made last year by voting to slash the 525 
million for clean coal research in fiscal 1989 to only 100 million 
the house bill would provide additional sums of 225 million in 
1990 and 200 million in the following year the senate deleted all 
clean coal money for those later two years 
miller urged congress to approve reagans request for 600 
million each in 1990 and 1991 for clean coal projects before a 
compromise bill is sent to the white house 
the senate deleted a house provision strongly opposed by the 
administration that would require that at least 50 percent of 
labor and materials used for offshore oil or gas rigs be made in 
the united states 
both measures include 3335 million to buy and transport oil to 
fill the strategic petroleum reserve but the senate bill sets 
915 million of the money aside as an advance appropriation for 
fiscal 1990

its been known as terra firma through the 
centuries but scientists reported today that the earth actually 
wobbles slightly as it rotates partly because of constant shifting 
of air masses in the atmosphere 
the wobble ranges up to only about two feet wide at the poles 
but its existence will let scientists use the earth as a means to 
studying the atmosphere said researcher t marshall eubanks 
he said the phenomenon is like the quiver of a clothes washer 
with an offcenter load with the shifting air masses acting like 
the unbalanced laundry 
an analysis is published in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by eubanks of the us naval observatory in washington and 
scientists at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena calif 
and atmospheric and environmental research inc of cambridge mass 
they found that over three years the wobble was related to 
changes in air pressure around the globe air pressure changes are 
created by the shifting in the atmosphere and eubanks said 
fluctuations as slight as onetenth percent to threetenths percent 
of normal atmospheric pressure appeared to contribute to the wobble 
scientists have long known that the earths axis displays 
regular oscillations lasting about 433 days and about a year and 
that the latter cycle is linked to the atmosphere 
the new paper focuses on recently discovered fluctuations with 
cycles of only two weeks to several months 
the atmospheres shiftings influence the earth through changes 
in air pressure at the planets surface because the earth bulges 
around its equator the weight of the atmosphere pushes not exactly 
toward the center of the earth but a little bit offcenter tending 
to nudge the earth off its rotational axis eubanks said in a 
telephone interview 
so for example if pressure is high over north america low 
over south america high over australia and low over siberia it 
would tend to rotate the earth as if a huge hand on north america 
were pushing south eubanks said 
that clearly seems to be the case for air pushing on land but 
the result of pushing on oceans is less understood he said 
over long periods ocean water responds to pressure by flowing 
off to the side dissipating the effect of the push much as a 
waterbed responds if one slowly sinks a foot into it he said 
but the new analysis suggests that the atmosphere may still 
exert some force through the oceans he said perhaps the oceans 
respond more like a waterbed being stomped on quickly with a 
complex sloshing back and forth that could still transmit pressure 
to the earth at the ocean floor he said 
the analysis found no contribution of winds to the fast wobble 
the work largely explains the wobble but leaves some questions 
unanswered said thomas herring of the harvardsmithsonian center 
for astrophysics in cambridge only recently have researchers 
gotten good enough data to demonstrate the link to the atmosphere 
he said in a telephone interview 
herring wrote in a nature editorial that the effects of winds 
and of air pressure over oceans are still open to debate but that 
they may contribute 
he also said scientists have yet to discover what keeps the 
433day oscillation going it measures an average of nearly 15 feet 
wide at the poles

seventyseven percent of britons can identify 
nelson mandela the jailed south african black leader making him a 
more familiar figure than most members of the british cabinet 
according to a new gallup poll 
apart from prime minister margaret thatcher mandela scored a 
higher recognition rating in the poll than did any british cabinet 
minister in a 1986 poll by market opinion and research 
international 
gallup made it easier with african national congress leader 
mandela mentioning his name as opposed to the mori pollsters two 
years ago who simply produced photographs and asked who it was 
even so mandela serving a life sentence imposed in 1964 on 
sabotage charges emerged far ahead of the allwhite 22member 
cabinet 
gallup spokesman bob wybrow said that if a respondent associated 
the mandela name with south africa or went further that counted 
as identification 
in the 1986 poll mrs thatcher scored a 9905 percent shutout 
the gallup poll was released wednesday it was commissioned by 
the londonbased antiapartheid movement to mark mandelas 70th 
birthday on monday

two protracted debilitating 
wars in southwestern africa could end if agreement among south 
africa angola and cuba leads to a final settlement 
us assistant secretary of state chester crocker who mediated 
the threeday talks in new york said wednesday that the parties 
have agreed on principles aimed at removing cuban troops from 
angola and ending south african rule in neighboring namibia 
further talks will be needed south africas chief delegate 
neil van heerden told the staterun broadcasting company there is 
a long way to go 
however the agreement on principles appeared to represent the 
most significant progress yet toward resolving angolas 13year 
civil war and obtaining independence for southwest africa also 
known as namibia 
guerrillas have been waging a bush war there against south 
africa rule since 1966 
heres a brief look at background of the two conflicts 
angola 
civil war broke out in late 1975 months after the country 
gained independence from portugal the rebels of unita the 
national union for the total independence of angola contended 
that the marxist faction that took power with soviet help reneged 
on an agreement to share power in advance of elections 
unita has since been fighting with the help of south africa and 
more recently the united states the marxist government has been 
backed by cuban troops which are now believed to number about 
50000 
south africa escalated its role in the war a year ago moving 
troops into southern angola on a longterm basis at least 45 south 
african soldiers have since been killed 
in recent months cuban troops for the first time moved en masse 
from the northern half of angola into the south in some cases 
deploying close to the namibian border some military analysts said 
the advance coincided with a shift in the balance of air power 
with the cubanangolan air force overcoming technical flaws and 
threatening south african supremacy 
one question arising from the peace talks remains the role of 
unita neither south africa nor the united states has indicated it 
is prepared to abandon the rebels but the angolan government 
insists it will not negotiate any powersharing arrangement with 
unita leader jonas savimbi 
the civil war has devastated angola economically killed tens of 
thousands of people and left thousands more crippled by land mines 
bombardments and ambushes 
south africa far wealthier and less affected by the combat has 
spent 2 billion a year on the war according to one experts 
estimate 
namibia 
made a german protectorate in 1884 namibia was surrendered to 
south africa in 1915 and administered by that country under a 
mandate of the league of nations a precursor to the united 
nations since 1978 south africa has defied un resolutions 
calling for namibias independence 
south africas has said it would grant namibia independence only 
after cuban troops leave angola it says the cuban military 
presence might intimidate namibians into supporting the southwest 
african peoples organization the guerrilla movement that took up 
arms 22 years ago 
swapo says it has the support of most namibians and feels 
certain of winning the national election envisioned under the un 
resolution 
blacks make up about 88 percent of namibias 13 million people 
and south africa has thus far preserved special privileges for the 
whites and people of mixed race there have been predictions that 
many of the 70000 whites would leave if independence under a 
swapoled government became imminent

seven men indicted on charges they violated federal 
neutrality laws by helping the nicaraguan contras say the reagan 
administration betrayed their patriotic fervor and abandoned them 
as scapegoats 
they used them and then abused them doug jones attorney 
for thomas posey said of the administration you will never hear 
one iota of evidence that anyone asked them to stop 
the federal indictment unsealed wednesday named seven men 
including the brother of contra leader adolfo calero but no us 
administration officials or top contra figures as some had 
expected even though the early stages of the probe helped uncover 
the irancontra military supply network 
the indictment speaks for itself said john mattes a 
federal public defender whose investigation of a clients case led 
to accusations that federal prosecutors tried to sidetrack the 
probe no one of substance was indicted 
the indictment covers a period in 1984 and 1985 and accuses the 
seven of violating the us neutrality act which prohibits 
mounting operations against foreign governments from us soil 
it accuses the men of sending mercenaries into combat in 
nicaragua including a group that tried unsuccessfully to blow up a 
bridge in 1985 but was forced out of the country said assistant 
us attorney mark schnapp 
as interim us attorney dexter lehtinen detailed the indictment 
in miami many outside the magistrates courtroom in fort 
lauderdale where the defendants were arraigned said they felt like 
minor players in a covert reagan administration policy gone sour 
where are the policy makers that put together this network 
mattes said why did they indict only the whistleblowers 
jeffrey feldman the assistant us attorney who prepared the 
case declined to talk about it because of a fundamental 
obligation to assure that the defendants get a fair trial 
of the six defendants who appeared in court wednesday four 
pleaded innocent two entered no plea because they did not have 
permanent counsel 
mattes and daniel sheehan attorney for the liberal christic 
institute suggested the indictments main aim was to silence 
jack terrell once a mercenary member of the contra aid network 
who later cooperated with fbi investigators and became an outspoken 
critic of reagan policy in nicaragua 
on wednesday terrell was bitter about facing the most serious 
charges despite his cooperation 
this is the reward you get for bucking administration 
policy he said it doesnt pay to be a whistleblower in the 
united states 
congress at one point investigated the federal indictment on 
charges that thenattorney general edwin meese iii tried to 
sidetrack the probe 
i have satisfied myself that there were no contacts made 
with this office that attempted to influence the investigation 
lehtinen said 
when reporters asked lehtinen about claims by some defendants 
that former national security council aide oliver north and robert 
owen approved their operations lehtinen referred all questions to 
the irancontra independent counsel 
the special prosecutors office cannot comment on current 
investigations said washington spokesman jim wiethart 
caleros brother mario calero of new orleans who has been 
active in supplying the contras is accused of helping to equip the 
mercenaries to battle the sandinistas in nicaragua 
i shall wear this as one more badge to show that i am proud to 
be a contra mario calero who is nicaraguan said of the 
indictment i am a contra i have a godgiven right to fight for 
my country how could i have violated the neutrality act 
others indicted were jose coutin a miami cuban and former 
civilian material assistance liaison here alex martinez a 
conservative cubanamerican stockbroker joe adams a former 
bodyguard to adolfo calero and maco stewart a wealthy former 
assistant state attorney general and a 19601963 state 
representative in texas 
stewart who lives in france was ordered released on a 5 
million personal bond and allowed to travel back to europe the 
rest received 25000 bonds except for adams who was to turn 
himself in later

a pair of labor disputes threaten to force 
democratic national convention delegates one quarter of whom 
belong to labor unions to avoid certain parties and to cross 
picket lines unless they want to walk to the convention 
the democrats who count heavily on labor support are hoping 
the disputes can be resolved or at least neutralized one union 
local says its parent union is pressuring it not to set up picket 
lines 
intricate transportation plans could be snarled if transit 
workers carry out threats to picket bus pickup points at hotels and 
downtown rail stations beginning monday the first day of the 
convention 
in addition social events for some of the partys elite plus a 
live broadcast of abctvs good morning america on friday could 
be disrupted by a campaign seeking to organize the citys janitors 
the metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority is providing 
106 of the 185 or so shuttle buses being used to ferry delegates 
and workers from atlantas hotels to the convention site 
although management and party officials question whether the 
transit union can picket legally because it is forbidden by state 
law from striking they admit privately that hardcore union 
members coming to the convention would be unlikely to stand on 
technicalities 
ralph green vice president of local 732 of the amalgamated 
transit union said wednesday international president jim lasala 
has called me and asked me to retract our position and he asked 
me to call together the executive committee friday and hes going 
to appeal to them to change their position 
transit workers have been working without a contract since oct 
19 
ruth berry spokewoman for the democratic national committee 
said wednesday the party did not have enough information to advise 
delegates how to respond to the threatened pickets 
meanwhile justice for janitors an organizing effort by the 
service employees international union threatens to embarrass city 
leaders who have struggled to portray atlanta as the progressive 
capital of the new south 
the union has targeted noted atlanta developerarchitect john 
portman and his home base of peachtree center even though portman 
does not directly employ janitors but uses janitorial service 
companies 
peachtree center is a complex of office buildings in the center 
of downtown including the site of several highprofile social 
events during the convention 
democratic presidential candidate jesse jackson and coretta 
scott king widow of the slain civil rights leader martin luther 
king jr have written letters supporting the union and mayor 
andrew young has attempted to mediate the dispute 
in a letter sent to delegates this week portman said he is 
neutral in the organizing battle but union officials say his 
companies have harassed janitors and discouraged efforts to 
organize janitorial service companies 
although neither portman nor his companies hire janitors 
directly hes the person that we have to deal with because he 
controls the money said union spokeswoman barbara webber 
portman also has ownership interest in several of the citys 
largest hotels including the marriott marquis one of two 
headquarters hotels and the location of fridays scheduled live 
broadcast of good morning america 
since good morning america is set for a live broadcast we 
think we can do something there to attract attention said robert 
sarason regional coordinator for the janitors union 
the union also plans pickets or other demonstrations at a brunch 
for congress members sunday given by usa today and it parent 
company gannett at the atlanta apparel mart a private dinner 
that night at portmans home for democratic national committee 
trustees and a reception for delegates at the marquis on wednesday 
given by delta air lines

ronald reagan seems to be the same 
handsome goodnatured fellow he was in 1932 when he started out 
as a 5aweek sports announcer at woc radio a former coworker 
said on the eve of the presidents return visit 
i dont think success has changed him a lot lucile mauget 
said wednesday he always had a joke and a smile 
fiftysix years ago reagan borrowed his fathers oldsmobile and 
set out from the family home in dixon ill in search of a job in 
radio he found one and today hes returning on air force one 
reagan planned to attend the dedication of wocs new building 
about three miles from where he started work broadcasting football 
games deliver a speech and reminisce on woc about his radio days 
the visit to this eastern iowa city was to be part of his tour of 
the droughtravaged midwest 
for someone who covers the white house every day this is 
probably pretty hohum but for us its very exciting said woc 
news director mark minnick who was to spend 10 minutes chatting on 
the air with reagan 
im excited and nervous minnick said i hope and pray i 
dont stumble all over my tongue hell probably be less nervous 
than i am 
when reagan was at woc more than half a century ago ms mauget 
worked in the business department and wrote paychecks for the 
stations 1520 employees including the man known to listeners as 
dutch 
reagan went on to become a movie star governor of california 
and president of the united states ms mauget worked off and on at 
woc for 35 years 
when she retired three years ago reagan remembered her 
i got a very nice letter from him mentioning that those were 
happy times he spent here she said 
reagan whose hometown of dixon ill was a 75mile drive away 
started at woc shortly after graduating from eureka college in 
illinois in 1932 his audition for a sports announcers job at the 
am station was to recreate an imaginary football game for 15 
minutes 
he got the job 
after his first recreation of a real football game reagan 
would take a teletype description of the game and broadcast it live 
his salary was doubled and he was put on for the rest of the 
football season 
when a staff opening came up he was hired fulltime at 25 a 
week a good salary during the great depression 
at 100 a month id never been richer reagan wrote in a 
1965 autobiography 
reagan went to work on feb 10 1933 and left for a job at 
wocs sister station who in des moines before the middle of may 
that year according to historian garry wills book reagans 
america 
ms mauget said she had thought reagan might go on to a network 
sports announcing job but did not consider he might someday be 
president 
i dont think when we were young we thought that far into the 
future ms mauget said i just knew he was serious about doing 
something 
in the 1920s when reagan was growing up the station used to 
sign off nightly with the message this is station woc 
davenport iowa where the west begins and in the state where the 
tall corn grows

a man who tried to sell his daughter to 
her uncle for 100000 was sentenced to three years probation and 
312 hours of community service in a plea bargain 
joseph waltman who had pleaded guilty to endangering the 
welfare of a child in the plea agreement was given probation 
wednesday because it was his first offense said bergen county 
superior court judge james madden he could have received a 
fiveyear prison term 
i am not condoning what this young man did madden said 
however there are mitigating circumstances extreme 
mitigating circumstances 
waltman 24 of alloway township was arrested outside giants 
stadium in east rutherford in march 1987 when he attempted to sell 
daughter rachel now 6 years old to her uncle gary stern police 
tipped off by stern were waiting for waltman in the new york city 
suburb 
waltmans attorney james patuto said his client was a victim 
of pressures brought on him in a battle over rachels custody with 
other family members 
the sentence was criticized by stern and his wife deborah of 
sunrise fla who adopted the child in may after a custody battle 
its a very dark day gary stern said you have to pray 
that if you can hold out long enough justice will prevail today 
it didnt 
the custody fight involving the sterns rachels maternal 
grandparents and her former stepmother followed waltmans arrest 
a new jersey judge awarded full custody to the sterns last 
december but gave the grandparents and the former stepmother 
visitation rights 
the sterns complied with the order sending rachel to new jersey 
twice for visits with her relatives 
but after a florida judge approved the adoption in may gary 
stern cut off visitation claiming rachel was now his daughter and 
that it was inappropriate for a child so young to be traveling back 
and forth 
sterns attorney harry gulkin said a child psychologist found 
that the visitation was causing rachel to become confused about her 
identity and her family 
last month a bridgeton judge found the sterns in contempt of 
court for adopting rachel in florida and interrupting the visits 
rachel who enters first grade this fall has been bounced from 
one family to another since her teenage mother died after a truck 
slammed into her car in october 1984 
she was awarded 29 million last year in a personal injury 
lawsuit against the company that owned the truck the payments do 
not begin until she turns 18

artful diplomacy may well resolve a 
current impasse over strategic us military bases in the 
philippines but the issue is likely to haunt the 
alliesturnedwary partners relations for some time 
the stumbling block now is money should the us boost the 
compensation it currently pays manila to maintain its massive naval 
and air installations in this southeast asian nation 
washington says the current 180 million a year is probably 
enough manila wants much more 
but the underlying problems are far more complex than cash they 
include growing filipino nationalism and american global interests 
local politicking here and nearly a century of intimate but not 
always happy relations 
recent polls indicate that if a general vote were taken now the 
bases would stay beyond the 1991 expiration of a 41yearold treaty 
under which they were established many filipinos perhaps most 
still appear to harbor proamerican feelings 
during this weeks visit to manila by secretary of state george 
p shultz the lines of filipinos outside the us embassy seeking 
visas far outnumbered nearby antiamerican demonstrators wielding 
placards reading go to hell not here 
but the onerous legacy of deposed president ferdinand e marcos 
and the still rocky democracy under president corazon aquino have 
created many problems related to the bases that have yet to be 
thrashed out 
mrs aquino was swept into power in february 1986 in a 
civilianmilitary uprising that sent marcos into exile in hawaii 
the uncertainties include a potent communist insurgency and a 
volatile political arena that has included the spectacle of several 
failed coup attempts by military factions 
beyond the island nation there are questions of whether the 
soviet union and china will continue beefing up their military 
forces in the region and how much pressure noncommunist southeast 
asian neighbors will exert on the philippines to keep the us 
military presence 
prime minister lee kuan yew of singapore a partner of the 
philippines in the association of southeast asian nations has said 
the bases are crucial for a balance of forces in the western 
pacific 
clark air base and subic naval base are the largest us 
military installations outside the united states subic is 
especially crucial because it serves as the major repair and supply 
facility for us forces in the pacific and indian oceans as well 
as the persian gulf 
mrs aquino herself is a question mark having maintained a 
steadfast silence over whether she wants the bases to remain i 
am keeping my options open she keeps saying 
staying or not staying also depends on how both sides muster 
their propaganda and play their diplomatic cards 
the protracted and still ongoing review of the agreement 
something called for every five years is probably a foretaste of 
things to come through 1991 
in negotiations beginning in april the philippine side asked 
for significantly more compensation some suggested 12 billion 
and more there was talk of terminating the agreement 
shultz called the sums staggering and said the us might 
have to move the bases elsewhere haggling continued 
during shultzs visit both sides said they hoped the review 
could be completed by the end of this month a compromise appeared 
to be in the making 
but still pending is the issue of whether the philippines will 
pass into law a bill banning all nuclear weapons from the country 
something washington strongly opposes 
and if the review negotiations and outcome leave too sour a 
taste in american mouths washington might be reluctant to provide 
large sums for a major multilateral plan to rehabilitate the 
tottering philippine economy 
meanwhile antiamerican protests have become a feature of 
manila life and the rhetoric as well as legitimate debate have 
heated up the bases issue has sparked political posturing and 
deeply rooted feelings about the united states and the countrys 
own past 
its time the americans should know we are not happy being 
treated as a charity case and its time too we filipinos 
shouldnt actreact as if our survival would forever be dependent 
on the mercy and benevolence of ole uncle sam said a recent 
editorial in manilas business world 
base opponents like to recall days when the country was under 
us colonial rule and more recent times when president reagan 
called marcos a force of reason and moderation in asia and vice 
president george bush praised him for his adherence to democratic 
principles 
the united states prefers to remember americans and filipinos 
fighting and dying sidebyside in world war ii and shared cultural 
and political values american diplomats work overtime trying to 
counter the rather loud antibase voices 
but one us embassy official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the time when us envoys spoke and filipino 
officials fell into line are over 
its real diplomacy in the trenches he said

firefighters today battled lightningsparked fires that raced 
across thousands of acres of dry brush and timber in several 
western states including montanas custer national forest where 44 
fires consumed nearly 4000 acres 
in wyoming a fire burning in the bridgerteton national 
forests teton wilderness bounded across meadows and pockets of 
dense trees on wednesday spreading from an estimated 100 acres to 
about 1000 acres 
the blaze threatened a 15000acre area of fallen trees 
representing about 100 million board feet of lumber forest 
spokesman fred kingwill said adding that authorities were not 
fighting the fire yet 
its continuing in a natural way as it would have several 
hundred years ago before man got here kingwill said 
steady winds of up to 15 mph fanned the flames pushing the fire 
northeast into pockets of lodgepole pine spruce and fir trees he 
said 
to the east 20 forest service firefighters battled a 400acre 
blaze in the thunder basin national grasslands where erratic wind 
combined with hot weather to push the flames across a containment 
line and into ponderosa pine trees grass and sagebrush 
in southeastern montana 44 fires started by lightning monday 
had burned about 3900 acres in droughtstricken custer national 
forests ashland ranger district 
while the temperature soared near 100 degrees wednesday 
hundreds of firefighters built containment lines while bombers and 
helicopters dropped retardant on the flames 
a fire about 15 miles northeast of ashland mont quadrupled in 
size wednesday afternoon growing from 200 to 800 acres said rob 
mcwhorter of the bureau of land management 
about 20 miles southeast of ashland another fire covered 2500 
acres with two 40person crews on the line along with five fire 
engines and two bulldozers mcwhorter said adding that the blaze 
was burning out of control 
in southeastern idahos caribou national forest firefighters 
had the 2300acre devils creek fire mostly contained but high 
wind low humidity and dry timber hampered their efforts said 
forest service spokesman frank carroll 
several hundred acres of droughtparched fallow cropland had 
been threatened by the fire earlier but only federal range and 
some private grazing land have been charred by the flames 
the fuels are critically extremely dry we have 8 percent 
humidity and 95 degree temperatures like phoenix ariz on a hot 
day carroll said 
near delta utah firefighters from utah and nevada made 
progress on three lightningsparked fires that burned nearly 1600 
acres of high mountain brush and timber 
a 400acre blaze in north canyon about 60 miles west of delta 
and a 900acre fire at the sage valley pass 11 miles southwest of 
nephi utah were both contained wednesday said bureau of land 
management dispatcher mike nielsen in richfield

attorney marc z edell is used to having 
jurors listen to him but the reaction of the stock market caught 
him off guard when his comments about cigarettehealth litigation 
sent tobacco stocks sharply higher 
its nice to be so important that people listen to what i 
say said edell who represented the widower of a lungcancer 
victim in a landmark lawsuit that led to the first damage award 
against a cigarettemaker for a smokers death 
analysts wednesday said edells prediction to a group of 
investors that liability cases would not seriously damage the 
financial health of cigarette makers prompted a buying spree for 
tobacco stocks 
in the most dramatic example philip morris cos inc jumped 6 
between july 6 the day before the luncheon investment meeting and 
wednesday when the stock closed at 8987 
rjrnabiscos stock rose 412 to 5187 during the period 
loews corp owner of cigarette maker lorillard inc rose 87 
cents to 6750 american brands rose 75 cents to 4987 and 
liggett group inc rose 12 cents to 8 
all but liggett had shown slight declines the day before the 
meeting the dow jones industrial average dipped from 2130 to 
2104 between july 6 and wednesdays close 
analysts attributed much of the rise to edells comments to 
about 60 institutional investment clients of sanford c bernstein amp 
co inc of new york 
i dont think theres any other explanation for it said 
bernstein tobacco analyst marc cohen 
it was very clear that people walked out of that meeting 
feeling very comfortable he said adding that tobacco stocks 
began an upward move that afternoon 
in a telephone interview edell said he told the investors 
nothing other than what he has said before and after the widely 
reported verdict in federal court in newark on june 13 that he did 
not think cigarette liability cases are going to have a serious 
financial impact on these companies 
the jury ordered liggett group inc to pay 400000 in damages 
to antonio cipollone for the death of his wife rose who died of 
lung cancer after 40 years of smoking 
many analysts have discounted fears that the cipollone decision 
would unleash a wave of liability cases against cigarette makers 
they noted that the jury exonerated liggett philip morris and 
lorillard of conspiring to defraud the public about the dangers of 
smoking 
despite those views many investment managers have taken a 
wait and see attitude toward tobacco stocks since the verdict 
cohen said but edells statement appears to have eased any 
lingering investor fears about the stocks he added 
also encouraging investors enthusiasm was an indication from 
philip morris and rjr that their secondquarter earnings due to be 
announced next week would be about 30 percent higher than last 
year said merrill lynch analyst allan kaplan 
edell said wednesday his firm has received more than a hundred 
calls nationwide asking him to take smokerdeath cases but that he 
and his partners have not decided yet whether to accept any of them 
cohen said edell told the investor group that he now could fight 
a liability case at a cost of 200000 following the work done on 
the cipollone case the lawyer has said that the 4year cipollone 
case cost 2 million

gail marshall who waved an american flag and clutched a stuffed 
bear intended as a present for her son 
the young aviator from oceano calif then kissed his mother 
christopher started his flight in san diego on july 7 he was 
accompanied by retired navy pilot randy cunningham 46 who limited 
marshalls flying time to eighthour stretches

louis new york montreal greenland iceland and scotland 
christopher revealed his youth

aircraft 
he arrived in reykjavik early wednesday after flying about 450 
miles from kulusuk on greenlands southeast coast in 2 hours 15 
minutes 
the arrival in paris was delayed by one day due to engine 
troubles wednesday that forced the plane back to greenland 
cunningham said he took over the controls to fly the plane 50 
miles back to greenland after engine trouble and bad weather with 
low visibility made the situation critical 
he said it was the only time during the flight that he took 
control of the aircraft 
cunningham said he had trouble finding the air field at kukusuk 
an island of greenlands southeast coast we would have had to 
ditch at sea i didnt think i was going to live 
the oil filter cap had rattled loose so the oil pressure 
plummeted and the engine overheated 
christophers mother said her son began flying with his father 
at the age of 4 and began training with an instructor at age 7 
she said she was worried by the problems wednesday 
if i knew i dont think i would have let him go she said

cbs announcement that it would bring in an abc 
news executive as president of cbs news marked the end of an era 
for cbs and the acknowledgement of a new period of respectability 
for abc 
abc news vice president david burke will become president of cbs 
news on aug 1 the first outsider to ever hold the job he 
replaces howard stringer who was promoted to president of the cbs 
broadcast group the financial heart of the network 
burke arrived at abc 11 years ago when roone arledge took over 
the division at the time it would have been unthinkable that 
bigshot cbs the home of the late broadcasting great edward r 
murrow would look to thirdplace abc for leadership 
thats one reason burkes boss at abc didnt exactly sound 
distraught when he commented on burkes new job 
he richly deserves this recognition which is a compliment 
both to him and to abc news we all wish him the absolute 
best arledge said 
stringer replaces gene jankowski who becomes chairman of the 
broadcast group 
william s paley chairman of the cbs board of directors and 
laurence a tisch the companys president and chief executive 
officer announced the changes in a statement wednesday 
the changes follow a dismal primetime season that dropped cbs 
into an embarrassing third in the ratings for the first time in its 
history 
despite that cbs also reported wednesday that its 
secondquarter profit climbed 40 percent to a record high the 
company cited higher interest income improved operating efficiency 
and an increase in broadcast sales in spite of a sluggish 
advertising market 
but tisch warned at a news conference that the business outlook 
for broadcasting this year is somewhat uncertain because the 
19week strike by the writers guild of america threatens to delay 
the start of the fall tv season 
the cbs news division has fairly flourished under the 
controversial and highly criticized layoffs and budget cuts that 
tisch imposed during stringers tenure as president 
despite the cutbacks the division reclaimed the morning show 
time period from the entertainment division launched a new 
primetime news show 48 hours and brought the cbs evening 
news back to no 1 in recent weeks after trailing nbc last summer 
and trailing abc during the second quarter of this year 
and cbs news has three hours of primetime news on the fall 
schedule albeit partly because of the writers strike creating 
the need for programming news show writers are not covered by the 
guild abc has one primetime news hour nbc none 
stringer a former executive producer of the cbs evening 
news has been with cbs for 23 years the last two as president 
of cbs news jankowski has served 11 years as president of the cbs 
broadcast group 
jankowski moved up through the cbs sales division to become head 
of the broadcast group during his tenure cbs primetime schedule

a former top justice department official denies 
smoking marijuana while us attorney for massachusetts and says 
he was warned the allegation might come up at a hearing into 
attorney general edwin meeses conduct 
i would have to be pretty dumb to smoke marijuana while a 
sitting us attorney william weld the former head of the 
justice departments criminal division said in a telephone 
interview wednesday 
weld who reportedly quit his justice department job because he 
thought there was enough evidence to seek a criminal indictment 
against meese told the senate judiciary committee in a letter 
tuesday that the marijuana allegation was unfounded 
weld also told the panel that he would testify about why he 
resigned meese under fire from congress because of questions 
raised about his ethics announced last week that he would leave 
the administration by next month after an independent prosecutor 
declined to bring charges against him 
weld said duke short the judiciary committees top republican 
aide told him the committee had been informed of the allegation 
and questioned whether it might complicate his testimony about 
meese set for july 26 
weld confirmed wednesdays story in the washington times that 
the departments office of professional responsibility last year 
investigated an allegation he smoked marijuana while attending a 
wedding in virginia in 1982 at the time he was massachusetts top 
federal prosecutor 
the investigation found no basis for the allegation which was 
raised in an anonymous letter to the department last july 
according to the boston globe 
however the times quoted sources as saying that frank mcnamara 
the current us attorney for massachusetts saw weld smoking 
marijuana at the wedding 
im not going tell you its not true the newspaper quoted 
mcnamara as saying 
i dont know why frank would say that weld said its 
absurd 
attempts to reach mcnamara for comment wednesday were 
unsuccessful a receptionist said mcnamara was in washington but 
could not say where a message left on his home answering machine 
was not returned

on murder charges in his native lebanon in 1983 according to 
evidence introduced today 
chief judge heiner mueckenberger read a document from 
authorities in lebanon that said an arrest warrant was issued for 
the defendant in 1983 on charges of murder and unlawful use of 
weapons 
the document did not contain details of the alleged crimes and 
hamadi said i dont know anything about it 
the twa jetliner on an athenstorome flight was hijacked in 
june 1985 us navy diver robert stethem of waldorf md was 
killed after the hijackers forced the plane to land in beirut 
thirtynine americans were held hostage during the 17day ordeal 
hamadi who came to west germany in 1982 also testified today 
that he worked at a cemetery in saarlouis in 1983 while his 
application for political asylum was pending 
he said he tried to commit suicide once by swallowing pills in 
1983 and once before by slashing his wrists because he was 
depressed about his life in west germany and because of 
developments in lebanon 
hamadi has said he returned to lebanon in 1984 in part because 
his application for political asylum was not approved 
a shiite moslem hamadi testified wednesday that he belonged to 
the shiite amal militia between 1980 and 1982 in beirut and was 
involved in battles there 
but he denied involvement with hezbollah or party of god a

fight against israel hamadi said making his first statements to 
the frankfurt court since his trial began last week 
there is a saying in our country in lebanon you are born 
with a weapon in your hand he said

everyone had these at home you could buy them like you buy 
eggs

germany twice contradicting a statement he made to police after 
his january 1987 arrest at the time hamadi told police he thought 
the bottles were filled with alcohol and denied knowing that they 
contained high explosives 
a certain person asked me to smuggle them in and hide them 
hamadi said i did it twice the second time i was arrested 
i dont know the reason why the explosives were brought in i was 
not told 
hamadi was accused of involvement in the hijacking based on 
evidence that includes fingerprints west germany last year

the ruling nationalist party gave new 
blood to its policymaking body today by replacing several aging 
holdovers from the chiang kaishek era with a more dynamic 
leadership 
president lee tenghui who last week became the first native 
taiwanese to lead the party has indicated that the newly organized 
central standing committee will try to bring further democratic 
change to this asian economic powerhouse 
twelve of 31 members of the committee stepped down including 
five of seven octogenarians the groups average age fell from 70 
to 63 for the first time a majority of the members are native 
taiwanese who now hold 16 seats 
in the past many of the party elders were completely out of 
touch with the society said lu yali political science 
professor at national taiwan university the younger members may 
not be all reformminded but they must be more sensitive to what 
the society wants they know that there must be a democratic 
change 
the new policymaking group whose decisions are implemented by 
the nationalist government was proposed by lee candidates were 
approved by the 180member central committee which was elected at 
the weeklong 13th party congress that concluded wednesday 
the nationalists began exercising oneparty rule on this island 
in 1949 when chiang kaishek led them in flight from mainland 
china after losing a civil war to the communists by claiming to 
still represent all china the party remained dominated by 
mainlanders 
but as the island prospered the native taiwanese who make up 
about 85 percent of the islands nearly 20 million people pressured 
for democratic change leading to the lifting of martial law and 
the end of a ban on opposition parties under president chiang 
chingkuo eldest son of chiang kaishek 
still to be changed is the parliamentary system in which 
mainland chinese nationalists hold a majority of seats as a symbol 
of the partys claim to china 
lee tenghui who became president when chiang chingkuo died 
last january has vowed to continue with political social and 
economic liberalization but the pace of change is likely to depend 
largely on the new policymaking committee 
the pace of reform may be quickened said lu 
key figures remaining on the committee include chief of general 
staff hau peitsun party secretarygeneral lee huan and premier yu 
kuohwa 
lee huan is seen as a supporter of the liberalization process 
while yu is viewed as the most powerful holdover from the 
authoritarian past of the nationalist party also known as 
kuomintang 
yu received less support than many younger vocal supporters of 
liberalization during the congress fueling specuation about his 
political future a cabinet reshuffle is expected soon 
the new central standing committee members include four chinese 
mainlanders age 64 or over two of whom are linked to the military 
also added to the policymaking body were five taiwanese a 
union leader an industrialist a leading central banker and two 
top politicians from the southern port of kaohsiung 
the remaining new members are frederick chien 54 taiwans main 
representative in washington education minister mao kaowen and 
47yearold james soong a party deputy secretarygeneral who is 
the youngest committee member and seen as a rising star

secretary of state george p shultz and foreign 
minister qian qichen of china today opened talks on the cambodian 
conflict and us concerns about chinese missile sales in the 
middle east 
shultz on the sixth stop of a ninenation asian tour arrived 
today from hong kong for a twoday visit 
foreign ministry spokesman jin guihua said efforts to end the 
nineyear vietnamese military occupation of cambodia would top the 
agenda 
china and the united states both demand the withdrawal of 
vietnams estimated 120000 troops but washington and other 
countries have expressed concern that the chinabacked khmer rouge 
part of a threeparty antivietnam resistance could regain power 
when vietnam leaves 
the khmer rouge under pol pot killed more than 1 million 
cambodians through its fanatical agrarian reform policies while 
ruling from 1975 until the vietnamese invasion in late 1978 
china the main supplier of arms to the khmer rouge recently 
said the communist group should not be the dominant force in a 
future cambodian government 
chinas foreign ministry recently called for freezing military 
forces of all sides and nominating for a future government leaders 
of various cambodian factions who are acceptable to all parties 
the plan effectively would rule out the return of pol pot and 
other khmer rouge leaders linked to past atrocities 
vietnam battered by economic failures at home has announced 
plans to withdraw 50000 troops this year and the rest by 1991 it 
has also agreed to meet representatives of the threeparty 
resistance coalition in indonesia later this month 
shultz on friday is to meet senior leader deng xiaoping premier 
li peng vice premier wu quexian and communist party chief zhao 
ziyang for talks expected to touch on chinese arms sales to the 
mideast ussoviet developments and security at the seoul olympic 
games 
a senior us state department source said in hong kong 
wednesday that shultz would tell chinese leaders that their 
ballistic missile sales to the middle east are adding another 
element of instability to that volatile region 
china has sold css2 intermediaterange missiles to saudi arabia 
and may be marketing a shorterrange weapon the m9 which has a 
range of between 190 and 370 miles and is still being tested 
it has denied selling the m9 to syria and says the css2s sold 
to saudi arabia are nonnuclear and defensive 
chinese arms sales to the middle east were also a major topic on 
shultzs last visit to china in march 1987 he urged china to stop 
supplying arms including silkworm missiles to iran 
china consistently denies it sells iran weapons and strongly 
criticized washingtons decision last fall to temporarily freeze 
relaxation of restrictions on us high technology sales to china 
because of the alleged silkworm sales washington lifted the freeze 
last march 
uschinese relations are marked by steadily expanding trade 
social academic military and scientific links 
trade topped 10 billion last year and us investors have 
committed 3 billion to chinese industry more than any other 
nation or region except hong kong 
the beijing government is actively courting american businessmen 
and seeking us participation in chinas ambitious development 
programs

us and vietnamese officials today 
opened talks on the united states offer to resettle thousands of 
people detained in reeducation camps after the vietnam war a 
western diplomat said 
the bangkokbased diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said he had no details on the talks being held in vietnams 
capital hanoi they were expected to last two days 
robert l funseth senior deputy assistant secretary of state 
for refugee programs leads the american negotiators 
funseth will seek emigration permission for some of the 900000 
former us government employees or officials of the south vietnam 
government who washington says have spent time in reeducation only 
a handful have gone to the united states the worlds largest 
resettler of vietnamese refugees 
the north vietnamese communists established the reeducation 
camps which usually combined manual labor with ideological study 
after defeating usbacked south vietnam in april 1975 
this weeks talks were agreed upon during a meeting at the 
united nations in june between foreign minister nguyen co thach of 
vietnam and retired gen john w vessey a special us 
presidential envoy 
in announcing the talks state department spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said most of the inmates were detained because of their us 
connections 
for this compelling humanitarian reason we have repeatedly 
affirmed our strong humanitarian desire to resettle those who wish 
in the united states as soon as possible she said 
the united states in 1984 said it was ready to resettle all 
those detained for their us ties but progress was stalled by the 
lack of diplomatic ties with vietnam washington has tried to 
isolate vietnam because of its 9yearold military occupation of 
cambodia 
vietnamese leaders calling for national reconciliation freed 
hundreds of former south vietnamese officials in september 1987 and 
february this year vice minister of information phan quang said on 
feb 11 that only 150 former officials were still held 
after meeting with vessey thach said the former prisoners could 
leave but that the united states must guarantee they wont be 
allowed to engage in activities hostile to vietnam us officials 
have said this was not possible because of the constitutional right 
to free speech 
funseths team also includes jeffrey millington director of the 
state departments office of vietnam laos and cambodia and bruce 
beardsley director of refugee affairs at the us embassy in 
bangkok 
the talks came a day after vietnam repatriated what may be the 
remains of 25 american servicemen missing in action from the war 
it was one of the largest turnovers ever the remains were flown 
from hanoi to an army laboratory in honolulu for analysis 
an official vietnam news agency report seen today said vietnam 
has returned the remains of 241 missing americans and information 
on 45 others whose remains are determined to be no longer in 
existence a total of 1761 americans are still missing in 
vietnam

a manual that compares jailers to lion 
tamers and calls inmates big cats who may need their food 
drugged to calm them has been withdrawn from a jail stafftraining 
program 
titled the lion tamer the illustrated sixpage pamphlet has 
been in circulation since 1982 and was used to train at least 50 
santa clara county deputies 
sheriff robert winter on wednesday ordered the guide removed as 
he soon as he found out about its existence said sgt cary colla 
all big cats arent the same the text reads you got your 
african lions you got your bengal tigers you got your pumas and 
you got your leopards now your african lions come from africa 
your bengal tigers come from asia your pumas come from the 
southwest or south of the border 
it goes on to refer to the leopards as crazy and say that 
they may need to have their food doped 
the guide uses sexual slang to describe the positive side of 
working as a jailer 
little kids and old ladies are dazzled by the lion tamer 
young ladies fall in love i mean he is one macho sob 
the manual says 
a spokesman for the sheriffs department denied that prisoners 
are drugged 
but william frazier a contra costa county sheriffs officer who 
wrote the guide conceded that drugs are routinely used in jails to 
control mentally ill or violent inmates who have taken pcp 
frazier denied that the book is racist or sexist 
its misunderstood he said were not training nuns to 
run a convent ive been told by more officers that this appealed 
to their fears 
the guide was part of a course taught by naber technical 
enterprises a private novato firm contracted by the jail to train 
workers 
the potential for violence is real and we wanted something to 
guide a staff apprehensive about losing barriers between themselves 
and inmates said bill naber president of the company the 
analogy was not meant to be demeaning

soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev told 
polish intellectuals today that the basic goal of his reform 
program is to ensure that working people live a better life 
gorbachev said he wants to return to the approach of vladimir i 
lenin founder of the soviet state who he said staged a revolution 
against exploitation to make man master of his own spirit 
the soviet leader on a sixday tour of poland spoke to several 
dozen academics writers scientists and cultural figures in the 
ornate gilded ballroom of warsaws royal castle polish state 
television broadcast the meeting 
a polish physicist in the audience thanked gorbachev for the 
decision by the soviet communist party conference to erect a 
monument in moscow to victims of the late soviet dictator josef 
stalin 
the scientist jan rychlewski said his father was among the 
polish communists who disappeared in stalins purges 
we will treat this monument as his grave the physicist told 
gorbachev 
gorbachev speaking in russian told his audience that during a 
stop at a farmers house near sczcecin on wednesday he was asked 
what he was trying to accomplish with perestroika his program 
to restructure and modernize the soviet economy and society 
simply we want in spite of everything for working people 
to lead a better life gorbachev said he replied 
gorbachev who grew up on a farm in southern russia added that 
socialism must make humanitarianism its most important achievement 
by improving the lives of the people in both the soviet union 
and poland all other fields of life will be transformed as well 
gorbachev said 
intellectuals can offer their support to reconstruction and 
renewal but its main goal is to improve the lives of workers and 
farmers gorbachev said on the train of perestroika he said 
these are the most significant and main passengers 
later gorbachev drove across town to party headquarters to meet 
with the leadership of the communist polish united workers party 
on wednesday gorbachev told about 3000 shipyard workers in 
sczcecin he is looking to poland for ideas to help solve economic 
problems at home and avoid making costly political mistakes 
we find many useful things in your experiences he said 
the speech was greeted with polite applause but little outward 
enthusiasm by the workers who were admitted by invitation the 
soviet union buys about half the ships built at the yard once a 
solidarity stronghold 
attempts by polands communist authorities to revive the 
nations stagnant economy are complicated by the soviet blocs best 
organized opposition 
solidarity the outlawed independent labor federation was 
stifled in a 1981 military crackdown but dissatisfaction with 
communist authorities unwillingness to share some measure of power 
or allow free trade unions is still strong enough to trigger 
disruptive strikes 
polish leader wojciech jaruzelski also is embarked on a reform 
campaign and both leaders have stressed their common goals during 
the soviet leaders visit 
but poland has so far failed in its attempt to bring prices more 
in line with actual costs and trim heavy government subsidies 
gorbachev told his nations communist party conference last 
month that a similar revision of the stateset price system is 
crucial to the success of his economic reforms 
jaruzelskis government raised prices an average of 40 percent 
this year almost immediately touching off a wave of strikes 
wage pressure quickly outpaced the increases triggering 
inflation that has hit 60 percent so far this year 
polish leaders now acknowledge that their price reform effort 
was a failure 
gorbachev later paid a private visit to an agricultural complex 
that serves as a model of highproductivity farming in western 
poland he also stopped at a prizewinning beef and dairy farm 
owned by franciszek bakan private farmers till most of polands 
arable land 
gorbachev has proposed that the soviet union return to family 
farming by leasing land to farmers to increase crop production and 
reduce the nations dependence on grain imports

us economic aid to nicaragua if the sandinistas fully comply with 
commitments made a year ago and proceed to permit the 
establishment of a democratic system 
the sense of the senate resolution is nonbinding 
but the wide bipartisan coalition which swung behind it 
emphasized the anger and concern caused by recent sandinista 
actions to suppress dissent 
these include the closing of the opposition newspaper la prensa 
and nicaraguas catholic radio station the suppression of a 
nonviolent demonstration in managua the arrest of 40 opposition 
political leaders and the expulsion of us ambassador richard 
melton and seven other us diplomats 
you can say its only a sense of the senate resolution but in 
my view it means a great deal said senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas 
dole told his colleagues we are moving now because the 
sandinista goons have been in the streets of managua again because 
the sandinista jails are filling up with new prisoners because 
what little independent media there has ever been in nicaragua is 
being closed down again and because the light of freedom in 
nicaragua has been nearly snuffed out again 
the resolution states in part the sandinistas should 
understand that blatant violations of last years peace agreement 
and the human rights of the nicaraguan people could cause congress 
to consider the provision of additional humanitarian and other 
appropriate assistance including military aid if conditions 
should so warrant 
sen david boren dokla said that by their actions the 
sandinistas have shown their true colors 
military aid to the contras was suspended in hopes that the 
central american peace process would take hold but boren said we 
have tried removing the pressure and all we have done is harm the 
cause of peace 
if the sandinistas continue down this path they will leave us 
no choice but to resume the pressure even military pressure if 
necessary 
only sens brock adams dwash mark hatfield rore spark 
matsunaga dhawaii and william proxmire dwis voted against 
the resolution not voting were sens joseph r biden ddel 
jesse helms rnc larry pressler rsd john stennis dmiss 
and strom thurmond rsc 
meanwhile the permanent council of the organization of american 
states planned a late afternoon meeting today at the request of 
nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann 
tunnermann who serves as both ambassador to the oas and the 
united states is expected to press his view that the reagan 
administration cannot legally expel a diplomat assigned to the oas 
on tuesday reagan announced that tunnermann and seven of his 
colleagues had 72 hours to leave the country the action was taken 
after nicaragua expelled melton and the other us diplomats from 
managua 
the state department maintains that tunnermann engaged in 
abuses of his privileges of residence here and that his 
expulsion is therefore both lawful and warranted it has given no 
details of the alleged abuses but one official said privately they 
are based on fbi investigations 
meanwhile the director general of the nicaraguan foreign 
ministry alejandro bendana provided what he said was further 
proof that us diplomats in managua were not engaging in 
acceptable diplomatic behavior 
appearing on pbs macneillehrer newshour wednesday night 
bendana held up a photograph showing what he claimed were three 
members of the us embassy staff openly taunting police 
officers on duty at an antigovernment demonstration 
deputy secretary of state john whitehead who appeared on the 
same program said the envoys attended the rally as observers and 
not participants he called bendanas charges absurd and 
outrageous 
bendana said that melton also had associated himself with 
extreme right businessmen in nicaragua who favor the overthrow 
of nicaraguas government 
he defended the closing of independent media outlets saying 
they had operated outside nicaraguas legal framework

michael dukakis says democratic running mate 
lloyd bentsen will disagree with him on some issues but their 
campaign will stress the general themes the two men can agree on 
were going to agree and we do agree on most issues the 
likely democratic nominee said wednesday well disagree on some 
but we both share a deep and abiding commitment to economic growth 
and opportunity for the people of this country 
and that will be the central thrust of our campaign the 
massachusetts governor said at a news conference with the texas 
senator 
he wasnt looking for a clone of michael dukakis bentsen 
said he is a man who will reach out to differing viewpoints 
bentsen is more conservative than dukakis on several issues 
he favors supporting the contra rebels in nicaragua voted for 
president reagans 1981 tax cuts and supports a constitutional 
amendment to balance the budget he also supported building the b1 
bomber and the mx missile and has voted for allowing prayer in 
schools and imposing the death penalty 
his job is to vote as he sees fit in the senate and i assume 
he will continue to do so said dukakis who opposed all of 
those he said bentsens different thinking would be a strength 
one of the reasons i picked lloyd bentsen is because i know 
that he will challenge me dukakis said 
dukakis used the questioning to get in a dig at vice president 
george bush the likely republican nominee saying he expects 
bentsen would come right into my office if the national 
security council was considering a cockamamie idea like selling 
arms to iran

richard thornburgh president reagans choice 
as the next attorney general said today he will talk to top 
justice department officials in the next week about improving 
morale following the departure of edwin meese iii 
i want to take a very careful look at what the level of 
commitment and what the level of morale is within the department 
thornburgh said on nbctvs today program 
i hope within the next week or so to begin some conversations 
with key people in the department so i can make that assessment of 
morale and we can deal with whatever problems exist there said 
thornburgh who was interviewed from boston 
the former pennsylvania governor said he would provide a firm 
hand at the tiller of the department 
reagan named thornburgh a former prosecutor and head of the 
justice departments criminal division to replace meese who 
announced his resignation july 5 after saying a special 
prosecutors report cleared him of allegations of wrongdoing 
meese who will depart in late july or early august said he was 
not leaving the department in disarray 
several top aides had only been on the job less than two months 
and two high department officials resigned in march to protest 
meeses continued tenure replacements for those people were found 
only after a highly public search in which the attorney general was 
rejected by other recruits 
asked in a separate interview today on abctvs good morning 
america program about possible morale problems thornburgh said 
obviously there have been some distractions and a lot of pressure 
in recent months but i think that can be dealt with appropriately 
with a firm hand at the tiller 
everybody has their own management style thornburgh 55 
said when asked how he would differ from meese 
what i hope to bring is a firm management style and a 
commitment to the principles that make for firm and fair law 
enforcement i would much prefer to look forward than look back 
thornburgh considered a moderate in republican circles also 
left open the possibility that he would accept an offer to stay on 
in the post if vice president george bush is elected president in 
november 
thats a question that vice president bush would have to 
decide if he were elected its no secret that i am a supporter of 
the vice president thornburgh said on abc ill take it on one 
day at a time and see what ensues 
there has been speculation that thornburgh might be tabbed as 
bushs running mate in the fall 
thats george bushs decision thornburgh told nbc 
obviously when an offer like that is forthcoming from a political 
leader the stature of george bush it would get serious 
consideration

given him the network said there was no change of mood or 
behavior after the flowers reached his nose

a court today convicted a palestinian 
believed linked to a terrorist attack on a greek cruise ship of 
entering the country illegally and sentenced him to seven months in 
prison 
dozens of police with automatic weapons stood guard at the 
athens courthouse where mohammed rashid was tried before a 
threejudge panel plainclothes officers packed the courtroom 
i am a member of the plo and the palestine liberation army i 
was passing through greece on a secret mission rashid 34 
testified 
the americans are trying to convince people the palestinians 
staged the cruise ship massacre so that i would be released this 
is not true he added 
rashid 34 was accused of entering greece may 25 with a false 
syrian passport police believe gunmen planned to hijack the city 
of poros cruise ship monday in an attempt to free rashid 
nine people were killed and 98 wounded when terrorists opened 
fire on the ship with machine guns and hurled grenades 
in bagdhad iraq a spokesman for palestine liberation 
organization chairman yasser arafat said the group condemned the 
ship attack 
rashid is also wanted in the united states for allegedly 
planting a bomb on a pan am jetliner in 1982 that killed one person 
and injured 15 
rashid claimed his real name was mohammed hamdam he said the 
passport used to enter greece was forged but added we are a 
refugee people and rarely can get papers he said the passport 
was given to him by his plo superiors 
the prosecution asked for a 10month sentence 
greece says it is considering a us extradition request but 
that rashid would have to serve his greek sentence before he could 
be sent to the united states 
rashid spoke in arabic his testimony was translated for the 
court by a translator of the plo mission in athens the trial took 
90 minutes 
rashids lawyer spyros fytrakis asked for rashid to be freed 
pending appeal but presiding judge mihalis margaritis ordered his 
continued detention at korydallos jail near athens 
rashid was brought to the court wednesday but the trial was 
held over for a day because his lawyer and interpreter were 
unavailable 
on wednesday a previously unknown group linked with 
palestinians claimed responsibility in beirut for the ship attack 
premier andreas papandreous socialist government was sharply 
criticized in parliament by the main rightwing opposition new 
democracy party it complained that the government failed to 
protect innocent tourists at a time of heightened world tension 
after the shooting down of the iranian airbus it was possible 
that there would be waves of terrorism and that greek territory 
could be threatened said parliamentary deputy nicolaos kostakis 
he was referring to the us downing of an iranian airliner on 
july 3 over the persian gulf killing all 290 people aboard the 
pentagon says the plane was mistaken for a fighter 
merchant marine minister evangelos yiannopoulos denied the 
government had been lax toward terrorists 
the exact number of terrorists in the attack remained unclear 
with most accounts by survivors and authorities putting the figure 
at three or four 
in beirut wednesday a group calling itself the organization 
of the martyrs of the popular revolution in palestine claimed 
responsiblity for the attack in a statement delivered to a western 
news agency 
it said the attack was in retaliation for the escalation in 
the operations and murder and extermination by the murderous 
zionistamerican gangs in palestine lebanon the persian gulf 
and all over the world 
the statement also claimed responsibility for the explosion of a 
car near the cruise ships home dock about six hours before the 
attack on the vessel the blast killed two people in the car 
police speculated the two were accomplices of the ship attackers 
and that automatic weapons grenades and explosives found in the 
car were intended for hijacking the ship

progress of the investigation 
the federal criminal police are leading the investigation and 
they havent released anything on it baugniet said 
about 500 soldiers from the british armys 3rd armored division 
transport regiment are based in duisburg 30 miles north of

michael dukakis is no more and no less a liberal 
today than he was before he recruited lloyd bentsen for his 
democratic ticket 
he is not the man who will be changing or tempering his views 
hes the boss 
bentsens arrival offers a gesture to the conservative 
democratic establishment to the ways of washington and congress 
perhaps to the world of finance and business it should help new 
englander dukakis in the south especially in texas with its 29 
electoral votes 
but the bentsen selection does not affect dukakis or the 
policies he has been describing during the long campaign that will 
reach one climax with his presidential nomination next wednesday 
thats not the way ticketmaking works it wont this time 
either notwithstanding dukakis statement that he wanted bentsen 
because he wants a vice president who will challenge me the 
challenge presumably would be intellectual not political and 
certainly not public 
dukakis may indeed amend some of his positions in the campaign 
months ahead and in office if he gets there responsibility tends 
to temper rhetoric although that is likely to be less a factor for 
dukakis than for politicians past 
the massachusetts governor has been proceeding with caution all 
along that is his style and it is reflected in the condensed and 
generalized campaign platform the democratic convention will adopt 
next week 
any visible changes in position will be made by the democratic 
senator from texas at a minimum where his public record is at 
odds with dukakis the rule for vice presidential nominees is 
silence 
he wont have to swallow nearly the mouthful vice president bush 
did after campaigning against ronald reagans tax cut proposal as 
voodoo economics bush who will face dukakis for presidency on 
nov 8 went from that line to unflinching loyalty as reagans 
running mate and then vice president he once joked that it was his 
most memorable political utterance and he regretted saying it 
theres nothing nearly as clear or dramatic standing between 
dukakis and bentsen dukakis said he expects bentsen to continue 
doing his duty and setting his own course as senator from texas he 
didnt add the corollary nor was it necessary 
nominees for vice president are not independent operators they 
are junior partners even when they are senior the presidential 
nominee runs the show 
that wouldnt have worked with jesse jackson who had advertised 
his willingness to accept the nomination with dukakis he is not a 
supporting player 
by jacksons account he should have been offered the nomination 
because he was the major alternative to dukakis throughout the 
primary season dukakis needs the black candidate now and the 
democrats need the black votes he can rally 
but no 2 on the ticket doesnt necessarily go to no 2 in the 
campaign even though some vice presidential choices have been made 
as gestures to losers and their constituencies in contests for 
presidential nominations it is winner take all and it is up to 
the winner to decide how and where to compromise to temper 
positions to make the gestures that can bind campaign wounds 
originally the vice president was chosen for being second each 
member of the electoral college got to cast two votes whoever got 
the most was president whoever ran second became vice president 
but that only lasted until 1804 when the constitution was amended 
to provide separate votes on the two offices 
an early member of congress roger griswold of connecticut saw 
a risk in that change the office will generally be carried into 
the market to be exchanged for the votes of some large state for 
president he warned 
the greatest danger is that the man just nominated for 
president will try desperately to heal the wounds and placate the 
dissidents in his party said henry a wallace a oneterm vice 
president a decade after he was dumped from the democratic ticket 
in 1944 my battle cry would be no more deals and no more 
balancing of the ticket 
that sounds good it wont happen

last week case agreed to drop opposition to comanche peak in 
exchange for a fiveyear term for its leader juanita ellis on a 
committee overseeing the plant 
case also will be reimbursed 45 million in legal fees and 
other expenses by texas utilities utility attorney george edgar 
said

cover any damages it might have to pay in some other legal actions 
said spokesman dick ramsey some 50 workers involved in the 
construction of the plant have suits pending with the labor 
department charging construction flaws said ms ellis 
in 1984 when the utility began to address the issues raised by 
case in 1978 doyle said the cooperation has been unbelievable 
at first i thought i was being conned i had to be conned i now

city council allies of mayor eugene sawyer have 
stripped power from his key opponents in a meeting marked by 
namecalling and police intervention driving a deeper political 
wedge into the citys black community 
this just opens all the old wounds said political scientist 
paul kleppner of northern illinois university 
most white aldermen voted to oust eight opponents of the black 
mayor including several influential black aldermen from committee 
chairmanships during an unruly council meeting that ended late 
wednesday 
at one point during the meeting police officers rushed to the 
floor to break up a nearfight between dorothy tillman a black 
sawyer critic and marlene carter a black sawyer ally 
one more step and i would have put her on the floor ms 
tillman told reporters my mama didnt buy me dolls when i was a 
girl 
the session was reminiscent of the raucous allnight council 
meeting in december when sawyer then an alderman was named to 
succeed harold washington the citys first black mayor a week 
after washingtons death sawyer was supported then by many of the 
same white aldermen who helped reshape the committees wednesday 
sawyer told reporters he would have preferred to wait until the 
end of the month to restructure committee leadership so he could 
get more support for the plan but he said the majority of the 
council got anxious 
i had to seize control he said 
we have an agenda to move a city to run they have another 
agenda he said of his opponents and its not mine 
allies of the mayor said the committee reassignments were 
necessary because sawyers opponents were using their posts to 
spoil his administration 
sawyer needed a real balanced reorganization said michael 
sheahan a white supporter 
but opponents predicted further erosion in sawyers black 
political base 
many of the blacks in the gallery shouted go home uncle 
tom to some of the black aldermen who defended the purge 
mr mayor i think youve made a terrible mistake alderman 
danny davis said on the council floor pointing a finger at sawyer 
it looks like everything we fought for that harold washington 
died for is being turned back 
i guess you and your colleagues have declared war in the black 
community 
davis is one of three ousted aldermen who have indicated they 
will run against sawyer for mayor 
kleppner who has tracked voting patterns in chicago for the 
us justice department said sawyer will find few political gains 
he cant go back to his normal constituency blacks 
kleppner said theres no place else but to go to the white 
ethnics the opponents of harold washington who put sawyer there 
in the first place

sayed ahmad gailani refused to say whether the decision cancels 
earlier guerrilla vows to keep soviet prisoners of war for leverage 
in future talks on a new afghan government 
there was no immediate comment from the soviets 
gulbaddin hekmatyar leader of one of two hezbeislami factions 
within the sevenparty guerrilla alliance claims to have a good 
number of soviet prisoners last week he had said no 
negotiations for their release would take place until all soviets 
leave all afghanistan 
but wednesdays decision to negotiate with the soviets was 
unanimous 
farooq azam with gailanis national islamic front of 
afghanistan said reports reaching the guerrilla alliance say the 
soviets are ready to negotiate with the guerrillas about prisoners 
of war 
the soviet union says 312 soldiers are missing the guerrillas 
refuse to say how many prisoners they hold 
the international committee for the red cross has been given 
responsibility for prisoners of war said diego cordovez un 
special envoy but the guerrillas say they will talk only to a 
soviet delegation talks must be direct or not at all said azam 
gailani refused to say whether the alliance decision means the 
guerrilla groups will pool their prisoners and decide their fate as 
a single unit or whether they will remain prisoners of individual 
groups 
in march representatives of hekmatyars group met with a soviet 
delegation to negotiate a prisoner exchange and a formula of one 
soviet prisoner for 25 afghan guerrillas was struck however 
hekmatyar cancelled the agreement after an agreement was signed 
april 14 in geneva under which the soviets agreed to withdraw 
their troops from afghanistan 
the only prisoner exchange since the accord was in late june 
when rasoul sayyafs ittehadeislami group turned over one soviet 
soldier for seven afghan prisoners 
gailani said the decision to open direct talks with the soviet 
union on prisoner exchanges was made on humanitarian grounds 
the soviets entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
marxist government fight the guerrillas who wanted to set up an 
islamic state

men and women who seek to become 
bishops in the united methodist church are supposed to wait for 
their calling but some of them also believe it helps to 
campaign a little for the job 
seven new bishops a record for the jurisdiction will be 
elected at this weeks southeastern jurisdictional conference 
before the gathering of 588 methodists from nine southeastern 
states ends saturday 
in the weeks leading up to the meeting some of the 14 official 
candidates issued brochures touting themselves some of them also 
have a member of their delegation acting as campaign manager 
campaigning is nothing new to the jurisdiction but some 
observers believe it has become more of a factor this year 
i believe god can live with this process better than the 
backroom politics of past years said one delegate nowell 
bingham of murray ky 
the current nominating system was put into effect back in the 
1970s in an effort to open up the election process said bob lear 
director of the united methodist news service in washington 
before that he said most of the work was done behind the 
scenes 
the nominating system has had the affect of making the 
politics more intense said lear who has been covering church 
elections since 1960 i have a stack of campaign brochures in my 
office to prove it 
under the new system candidates go before their local 
conference to explain their positions the local delegates then 
decide which candidate from their area to endorse delegates to the 
regional conference make the final selection 
retired bishop h ellis finger of knoxville tenn was elected 
in 1964 before the nominating system existed 
there obviously were conversations but you werent required to 
appear before the delegates for an inquiry he said a person 
who was elected in those years was presented in conversation in 
dialogue 
cr hager a delegate from lexington ky was a member of the 
committee that revised the election system 
there was a lot of concern about the advertising he said 
before that it wasnt public it was a calling so a candidate 
wasnt supposed to get out to publicize himself 
hager believes the current system is far superior to the old 
one it gives us the opportunity to know about the candidates 
he said 
bingham said all 14 official candidates met with the various 
delegations at the churchs general conference earlier this year in 
st louis we videotaped it so we could bring it back for our 
church members to review he said

president jose sarney announced 
that brazil has discovered about 100 million barrels worth of oil 
in the atlantic ocean 
tests carried out off the coasts of parana sao paulo and 
santa catarina states have revealed a 26squaremile basin with 
potential for producing as much as 10000 barrels a day sarney 
told reporters wednesday 
brazil produces about 600000 barrels of oil a day 
in march sarney said the staterun oil company petrobras 
suspected there were oil deposits in the region but gave no 
estimates of the quantities involved 
according to sarney the oil was discovered 112 miles off 
brazils southern coast at a depth of 390 feet he also said the 
government oil monopoly had found substantial reserves of gas in 
the new basin 
brazil for decades produced oil only in its northeastern 
regions but in the 1970s major offshore finds were made off the 
coast of rio de janeiro state allowing brazil to increase its 
domestically produced oil supply from 20 percent to 55 percent 
the country now produces about 60 percent of the oil it consumes

weather forecasters today were offering 
droughtstricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate 
outlooks for the next 30 days and three months 
a new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said many 
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent 
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months 
the disappointing forecast came as president reagan headed to 
the midwest to inspect droughtplagued farms 
on tuesday the agriculture department reported sharp declines in 
the outlook for several crops 
that was followed wednesday by a 30day forecast from the 
national weather service saying that droughtstricken areas from 
the dakotas east to new york and from the canadian border to 
oklahoma arkansas and tennessee are likely to continue to be short 
of rain 
that area which includes the major graingrowing states where 
crops already are suffering is given a 55 percent chance of less 
than normal rainfall 
and some states in the center of the area stretching from west 
virginia to nebraska and from wisconsin to missouri may be even 
drier they are given a 60 percent chance of being short of 
precipitation 
a slice of southern california including los angeles is the 
driest area in the forecast with a 70 percent chance of having 
below normal rainfall the rest of coastal california also will be 
dry the forecast said 
the outlook also says theres a 55 percent chance of hotter than 
normal temperatures through the us heartland from new england to 
idaho and from the canadian border to oklahoma within that area 
the chances of high temperatures are above 65 percent in wyoming 
while central midwestern states have a 60 percent chance of above 
average temperatures 
wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south 
texas and parts of new mexico arizona and utah normal 
precipitation is forecast for the atlantic and gulf coast states 
along with the northwest and northern mountain states 
the weather service said normal temperatures are expected for 
the atlantic states from virginia south and for the gulf coast 
states west texas and new mexico may be cooler than normal but 
the far west is expected to see its normal quota of summer heat 
the separate drought impact assessment issued by the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administrations climate office points out 
that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing since dry 
spells have no normal lifetime the low 4 percent probability of an 
end within 3 months is based simply on a statistical analysis of 
past droughts the agency said 
the report noted that as of the end of june 29 percent of the 
continental united states was experiencing severe or extreme 
drought with parts of 35 states affected that puts the current 
drought on the same level as the one in 1911 but still less severe 
than the droughts of 1936 1931 1956 and 1934

have blocked the only highway between alaska and the lower 48 
states stranding hundreds of travelers in towns and campgrounds 
canadian highway officials say 
no injuries were reported 
the yukon territory and northern british columbia have been 
deluged with four to five times their normal rainfall during the 
first half of july

northwest of haines junction yukon more than 200 miles northwest 
of juneau highway officials said 
it mud is about 12 feet high said yukon highways 
supervisor colin yuelet theres just over a mile of road thats 
under water or mud

mountainside across the road and into the south end of kluane lake 
smaller slides and washouts blocked a 43mile stretch of the 
alaska highway near muncho lake in northern british columbia said 
jim coxford of the canadian public works department in whitehorse 
if the rain continues clearing the kluane lake slide could take 
up to a week said yeulet he borrowed two bulldozers from a road 
construction company to handle the project 
travelers caught between the two areas of slides holed up in the 
yukon capital of whitehorse about 90 miles southeast of haines 
junction or were directed to take a much longer route into alaska 
through dawson yukon 
on the northwest side of the slide canadian customs officials 
advised tourists entering the yukon from alaska to take the longer 
route or to wait out the slide in about a dozen lodges between the 
border and the roadblock 
as many as 400 vehicles cross the border daily last july 
canadian customs counted 33512 people driving the highway from 
alaska into the yukon 
we are as busy as busy can be because the road is now blocked 
to the north and south of us said jack austad weigh scale

questions here all day 
in haines junction town manager joanne feenstra said she was 
getting ready to open the community hall to travelers

through the muncho area tuesday dodging small slides and big

gathered in pouring rain on the steps of the lenin library within 
sight of the kremlin and hauled them onto the yellow bus

not been arrested and then hung up the phone

deportation of tens of thousands of baltic residents whom dictator 
josef stalin accused of being nazi sympathizers the soviet union 
annexed the baltic nations of latvia estonia and lithuania in 1940 
under a secret agreement with nazi germany 
the journalist sergei i grigoryants whom gorbachev condemned 
in a may interview as a parasite sponging on the democratic 
process managed to elude officers for a few minutes but after 
handing reporters a statement about the protest he too was 
arrested 
the demonstrators also included representatives of informal 
political groups from estonia and lithuania also present were 
ukrainian human rights activists

the american civil liberties union is 
challenging an ordinance requiring people to obtain a permit from 
the police chief before they can move in or out of the city 
the aclu is defending lenna palmer who is accused of violating 
the municipal code by moving out of east orange an urban 
bluecollar community of 77000 outside newark palmer received a 
summons in may 
the city has a right to know when people move in and out of 
its town said city clerk earl williams he said said the purpose 
of the ordinance is to allow officials to find people who owe the 
city money 
but eric neisser legal director of the state aclu said the 
basic right of all people in this country is to travel and move 
around obviously in states and between states and this ordinance 
restricts that right 
it affects privacy primarily because the ordinance says you 
have to file an application telling them where youre moving to 
neisser said 
at a hearing today municipal judge ernest booker postponed the 
case until aug 17 after city attorneys said they needed more time 
to study the issues 
the judge also told both sides to submit arguments explaining 
why issues of constitutionality should be decided by a municipal 
court 
police chief george daher was out of town and could not be 
reached for comment wednesday officials said 
the citys attorneys declined to comment outside court today 
the ordinance requires a person to file with the chief a 2 
application listing the persons old and new address the date of 
the move and how the persons property will be transported 
moving is prohibited after sundown or on sundays and violators 
are subject to a 500 fine and 90 days in jail 
marianne tolomeo an aclu attorney defending ms palmer said 
the us supreme court has held that there is a constitutional 
right to travel and struck down a nevada law that levied a 1 tax 
on everyone leaving the state 
ms palmer now lives in a neighboring community

the leftist sandinista government has 
nationalized the nations largest and oldest private enterprise in 
what the opposition calls the latest in a series of repressive 
moves 
the agrarian reform ministry announced the takeover of the san 
antonio sugar refinery on wednesday it said the owners hadnt 
invested in the company since 1981 hurting sales dollar income 
and working conditions 
the move leaves nearly the entire sugar industry in the hands of 
the government which has virtually no money to pay compensation 
the san antonio mill had become a symbol of private enterprise 
which the opposition favors over socialism 
the crackdown by the sandinistas who in recent months appeared 
to be easing controls on society began sunday when police used 
tear gas to break up an authorized opposition march 
they beat and arrested several dozen of the 10000 demontrators 
the crackdown appears a reaction to continued attacks by 
usbacked contra rebels the appearance of us embassy personnel 
at sundays march increasing domestic dissent and pressure from 
hardline sandinista leaders 
with the economic crisis deepening opposition groups seem 
stronger and more united than ever 
on monday the foreign ministry ordered the expulsion of us 
ambassador richard melton and seven other embassy diplomats 
the sandinistas charged that the us embassy supported sundays 
march as part of a plan to destabilize the government by creating 
an internal front 
at the same time the sandinistas closed the roman catholic 
radio station indefinitely and suspended for 15 days the 
publication of the only opposition newspaper la prensa 
the press restrictions mean neither can cover ceremonies next 
tuesday celebarting the ninth anniversary of the revolution that 
ousted president anastasio somoza or the hunger march an 
opposition group plans for july 24 
since august the sandinistas had loosened the reins to comply 
with a regional peace plan restoring many liberties taken away 
during the nearly 7yearold war with the contras 
la prensa was permitted to reopen after being shut 15 months and 
to publish without censorship for the first time in five years 
the moves paid off when in february congress rejected president 
reagans request for continued military aid to the contras 
but hardline sandinistas including interior minister tomas 
borge reportedly objected to the concessions borge controls the 
media and the police 
in march the sandinistas began peace talks with the contras and 
on march 23 a temporary ceasefire agreement was signed a series 
of meetings since has failed to produce any concrete results 
talks broke off june 9 but the sandinistas have twice 
unilaterally renewed temporary truces over the past week they 
have reported daily contra attacks 
the latest bulletin by the defense ministry said one civilian 
was killed and six wounded wednesday when a tranportation ministry 
truck ran over a mine about 95 miles northeast of managua 
the foreign ministry sent a note to us secretary of state 
george p shultz protesting the incident 
the expropriation of the sugar mill appears to contradict 
earlier statements by president daniel ortega 
in midjune ortega announced the latest in moves designed to 
revive the economy the government says the war has caused 36 
billion in damage and annual inflation runs well over 1000 
percent 
ortega said the government needs to move away from marxist 
economic measures and lean toward capitalism he said monetary 
rather than moral incentives should bolster production 
but most sectors balked and the sandinistas ended up agreeing 
to provide a small amount of beans rice and sugar to workers in 
nonproductive areas such as doctors teachers and soldiers 
the san antonio sugar refinery confiscated on wednesday was 
described as the last of a mixed economy in nicaragua by 
gilberto cuadra the vice president of the antigovernment private 
enterprise council

the judge in the case of an excia agent 
accused of conspiring to illegally ship arms to nicaraguan rebels 
today rejected a defense objection to pretrial procedures for 
handling classified documents 
us district judge aubrey e robinson jr approved security 
rules proposed by prosecutors to govern the handling of thousands 
of pages of classified documents that were gathered by prosecutors 
in the case 
a defense attorney for joseph f fernandez the cias former 
station chief in costa rica argued that the order contained so 
many restrictions on the use of classified documents by the defense 
team as to be constitutionally faulty 
this is a completely unprecedented case in terms of the 
defendant and the nature of the indictment and the nature of the 
information that will be needed to defend the charges said 
defense lawyer thomas e wilson 
robinson approved the protective order proposed by prosecutors 
on the staff of independent counsel lawrence e walsh but said he 
would be willing to make changes if the defense found the rules 
unworkable 
the order restricts the use of classified documents to a secure 
facility that is supervised by a court security officer witnesses 
whom defense lawyers want to show documents must sign pledges not 
to reveal the information to others 
robinson granted wilsons request that the names of people 
signing such pledges not be shown to prosecutors you dont need 
to know that the judge told hassler 
the judge scheduled an aug 15 hearing to consider fernandezs 
challenge to the constitutionality of the classified information 
procedures act as it applies to his case 
the statute requires defendants to notify the government of 
specific government secrets they plan to divulge during the trial 
to defend criminal charges 
the defense contends that the requirement tramples on 
fernandezs right to a fair trial because the case involves at 
least 60000 secret documents as well as witnesses whose very 
identity is still classified 
wilson argued in court papers filed wednesday that prosecutors 
would be tipped to the defense strategy if told in advance of the 
secrets he planned to divulge 
testimony of virtually every government witness and the vast 
majority of likely defense witnesses will inevitably contain a 
great deal of classified information the defense brief said 
even the identity of many of the witnesses in the case 
witnesses for both the government and the defense will be 
classified fernandezs lawyer said 
wilson noted that fernandezs testimony to congressional 
committees investigating the irancontra affair was given in closed 
sessions and released only after numerous references to classified 
information were deleted 
fernandez who operated in central america under the pseudonym 
of tomas castillo is charged with conspiring to operate an illegal 
armssupply network to the nicaraguan rebels in defiance of a 
congressional ban on such military assistance 
he also is accused of lying to his cia superiors as well as to 
the presidential commission headed by former sen john tower 
rtexas that investigated the irancontra affair 
his constitutional challenge is similar to one mounted by fired 
white house aide oliver l north former national security adviser 
john m poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air 
force maj gen richard v secord 
the four are charged with conspiring to illegally divert 
usiran armssales profits to the contras 
in that case us district judge gerhard a gesell denied a 
defense motion to declare the statute unconstitutional gesell has 
ordered four separate trials and scheduled norths for sept 20 
on wednesday gesell also scheduled closed hearings on aug 8 
and aug 22 to consider norths proposals to use secret documents 
at his trial

a 73yearold federal judge apologized today 
for outlawing the courtesy title ms in his courtroom and 
interrupting a race discrimination trial to scold an attorney for 
using her maiden name 
i unfortunately lost my temper senior us district judge 
hubert i teitelbaum said in a statement 
i have always referred to married women by their married name 
this is the way my generation was taught he said i recognize 
your right to be addressed in any manner in which you see fit and 
i apologize for my comment and the resulting situation 
teitelbaum directed his apology to barbara wolvovitz whom he 
told on friday from here on in this courtroom you will use mrs 
lobel thats your name she is the wife of university of 
pittsburgh law professor jules lobel 
the judge originally threatened the lawyer with jail when she 
resisted and when her cocounsel jon pushinsky came to her 
defense teitelbaum found him in contempt for officious 
intermeddling and gave him a suspended 30day jail sentence 
ms wolvovitz on monday asked for mistrial which teitelbaum 
rejected adding what if i call you sweetie he then settled 
on calling her counselor 
in his apology teitelbaum said he would grant a mistrial if the 
defense requested one again before the jury returned with a verdict 
during a disjointed dialogue friday that covered about 20 pages 
of court transcript teitelbaum told ms wolvovitz that mrs lobel 
is her legal name under the laws of the state of pennsylvania 
and thats what i want you to be to call yourself from here 
on in this courtroom he said thats an intolerable kind of 
thing 
the judge claimed a married woman must petition common pleas 
court for permission to use her maiden name however the 
pennsylvania family law practice and procedure handbook said no 
legal proceedings are required 
teitelbaum presiding over a race discrimination suit against 
ppg industries inc also asked each of the six female jurors 
friday if she used her husbands name or maiden name all used 
their husbands names 
the trial began june 23 but the issue of ms in 
teitelbaums court never surfaced before friday 
the case went to the jury wednesday ms wolvovitz said she 
would not decide whether to file a complaint against the judge 
until after the jury delivers its verdict 
teitelbaum 73 a former us attorney appointed to the federal 
bench by president nixon in 1970 declined to comment wednesday to 
the associated press 
according to the american bar association ms wolvovitz could 
file a complaint with the 3rd circuit court of appeals in 
philadelphia which could decide to publicly or privately admonish 
the judge said ernest zavodnyk with the chicagobased judicial 
administration division 
ms wolvovitz 36 said she was in shock for two days 
ive practiced for 10 years ive gotten into arguments with 
judges but never over something like this i cant quite understand 
what happened said ms wolvovitz who had never argued a case 
before teitelbaum after it was over and the jury left i had 
tears in my eyes 
we didnt know what to do she started crying i started 
crying said ms wolvovitzs client charles gavin 
teitelbaum retreated monday on his threat to jail pushinsky 
saying did you really think you were going to jail 
when pushinsky said he didnt draw any conclusions 
teitelbaum said i just thought over the weekend id let you 
think about it 
i never thought he was such a neanderthal said national 
organization for women president molly yard a pittsburgh resident 
who is familiar with teitelbaum i cant understand how anybody 
whos bright enough to be on federal court can make such an error 
in judgment

two women told congress today they have 
suffered permanent health damage as a result of exposure to 
chemical products used in beauty salons 
edith khatami said she has a central nervous disorder called 
cognitive dysfunction as well as occupational asthma caused by 
handling chemicals that contain methylene chloride at a wig salon 
in cupertino calif 
i cant remember things that i did just a short while ago 
mrs khatami said thats one of the health effects of the 
neurotoxins i was exposed to said the woman who styled wigs for 
four years until 1985 
mrs khatami and kristie smith 24 of portland ore appeared 
before a house small business committee which is investigating 
regulation of the cosmetics industry a 17billionayear business 
rep ron wyden dore the chairman said the food and drug 
administration does not test cosmetics for safety as it does food 
and drugs moreover the fda does not have the authority to require 
that the manufacturers prove the safety of their products before 
they are marketed 
these regulatory gaps raise serious questions about the food 
and drug administrations ability to effectively oversee this 
booming industry he said 
wyden said cosmetic ingredients may cause cancer birth 
defects central nervous system disorders allergic reactions and 
have longterm health effects 
wyden said nearly 8000 chemicals are used in cosmetics and 
fragrances products on the market combine those chemicals in as 
many as 20000 and 40000 combinations 
fda spokesman emil corwin was not immediately available to 
provide a response his secretary said 
ms smith said she never suffered from asthma until she was 
exposed to chemicals used on patrons hair at a beauty school four 
years ago today she said she has a lung condition so bad that a 
whiff of perfume can trigger a breathing attack 
what i am really angry about is that no one told me or 
anyone else in my school that the chemicals we were using might 
be dangerous ms smith said 
she said she encountered trouble breathing within months of 
enrolling in the beauty school where she routinely gave women 
permanent waves and used other chemical compounds she was 
diagnosed as having occupational asthma 10 months after starting 
school 
she said she sued the school and received a 12000 settlement 
she is now a bartender 
beth shulman vice president of the united food and commercial 
workers international union said members of the union who work in 
salons and beauty schools are worried about the chemicals contained 
in the products they handle 
these products may seem benign because of their attractive 
packaging and fragrances but the chemical ingredients in them are 
not she said 
she said the committees task to determine if the american 
public is protected from hazardous chemicals in cosmetics is an 
urgent one

the smallest human ever to receive a liver 
transplant died this morning two days after he and another baby 
became the first americans to receive divided parts of a single 
donor organ a hospital spokesman said 
the other youngster 7month old jaclyn manrose of crystal lake 
ill was in critical and stable condition but doing very well 
the spokesman said 
twelveweekold joseph kovach died today at 830 am from 
heart failure at wyler childrens hospital said john easton a 
spokesman for the hospital 
he had a major birth defect involving the heart easton said 
of the geneva ill boy shortly after the transplant the 
infant suffered a brief cardiac arrest which was attributed to 
weakened heart and the stress of major surgery 
the shock of the episode caused his kidneys to fail and his 
impaired his breathing the spokesman said 
the youngsters were participants in the first double liver 
transplant ever performed in the united states receiving the 
divided liver of a 1yearold illinois child who had died in an 
accident the university said 
weighing only 42 pounds joseph was the smallest human ever to 
get a liver transplant easton said 
because of his small size and additional medical problems 
joseph kovach was a highrisk transplant candidate said dr 
peter whitington associate professor of pediatrics and the 
physician in charge of josephs care 
but because of his advanced liver disease he urgently needed 
a transplant to have a chance at survival whitington added in a 
statement 
tuesdays operation lasted 12 hours double liver transplants 
involving adult donors have been performed in europe but such an 
operation has not been done in the united states easton said 
donor livers are in short supply in this country an estimated 
475 people are awaiting liver transplants many of them children 
who will die without new organs 
joseph was born with neonatal cirrhosis a type of liver damage 
that exists at birth from an unknown cause the spokesman said 
jaclyn suffered from a hereditary defect called 
alpha1antitrypsin deficiencya deficiency of an enzyme that can 
lead to hepatitis or cirrhosis the spokesman said 
kovach was the more urgent of the two he said the 
operation was performed by dr christoff broelsch professor of 
surgery and head of liver transplantation at the university 
dr jean emond assistant professor of surgery operated on the 
manrose infant easton said 
during the early stages of that broelsch separated the 
liver easton said while emond was completing his operation 
broelsch did the transplant on kovach 
at a news conference wednesday the girls parents said they had 
no qualms about approving the experimental surgery for their 
daughter who has a 5yearold brother and a twin sister they were 
just glad a donor organ was available 
megan the twin wants her sister back said mother kathleen 
manrose whose husband bob is a maintenance specialist with 
united airlines 
josephs parents patty and donald kovach a comptroller for a 
chicago firm did not attend the news conference because their son 
was back in surgery 
two infants younger than joseph have received new livers at the 
university of pittsburghs transplant center but both weighed more 
than 6 pounds easton said

all 14 trucks and a bus in the veterans 
peace convoy carrying supplies to nicaragua have crossed the border 
into mexico despite earlier us efforts to block the groups 
journey a spokesman said today 
the vehicles that arrived at this texasmexico border city 
friday crossed the rio grande without incident among them were 
three vehicles that had earlier been stopped and towed away on 
saturday said spokesman raul valdez 
the same vehicles that got stopped saturday paid 75 cents 
and got across said valdez 
he said the 15 vehicles were clearly marked veterans peace 
convoy or displayed similar slogans one truck has been shuttling 
people back and forth across the border he said 
he said the group is puzzled why american authorities stopped 
trying to block the convoy 
customs officials had prevented the trucks from crossing the 
border at least three times contending that taking the vehicles to 
nicaragua would violate a 3yearold trade embargo against that 
country 
customs service spokeswoman donna de la torre in houston said 
today the agency has not changed its policy 
three vehicles did cross yesterday but they declared their 
intent to go to mexico only it is not against the law to go to 
mexico a fourth vehicle also approached and the driver said he was 
going to nicaragua but he was not allowed to cross she said 
i am aware of reports that other vehicles have crossed since 
then she said but they have crossed without the knowledge and 
approval of the us customs service without advance notice of 
export activity the customs service does not staff southbound 
lanes i would not be surprised that some vehicles had mingled with 
legitimate traffic and crossed 
texas rural legal aid lawyer william beardall told a federal 
judge wednesday that 10 convoy vehicles had crossed without 
incident his comments came during a hearing on a lawsuit convoy 
members filed against the government to try to win approval to take 
the vehicles which are loaded with food and medical supplies to 
nicaragua 
convoy members oppose us government policies in nicaragua 
including the embargo and us support for contra rebels fighting 
the leftist sandinista government the group is also sending about 
300 tons of aid by ship 
a vehicle can also be used to commit an act of terrorism 
justice department attorney john tyler said at wednesdays hearing 
the governments position is that the food and medical supplies 
qualify as humanitarian aid exempt from the embargo but that the 
vehicles do not constitute humanitarian aid 
convoy members have refused to sign forms promising they will 
return the vehicles within 30 days 
us district judge george p kazen gave both sides until july 
21 to file briefs in the case 
the convoy first tried to cross the us border june 15 and 
customs officials temporarily detained four trucks 
on saturday police arrested eight convoy members when they 
refused to leave the road leading to a toll booth at a rio grande 
bridge one of the eight was arrested again monday when he tried to 
drive across again 
violating the embargo could mean 10 years in prison and fines up 
to 50000 conroy said

the last of three men awaiting retrial in 
the 1973 slayings of six members of a farm family pleaded guilty 
today and was sentenced to life in prison 
george elder dungee 50 pleaed guilty to six counts of murder 
he was to have been retried later this year his 1974 conviction 
had been overturned by a federal appeals court on grounds that 
pretrial publicity prevented a fair trial 
muscogee county superior court judge hugh lawson sentenced 
dungee to three consecutive life terms and three concurrent life 
terms 
this is the sentence we had hoped to get to avoid the death 
penalty said defense attorney stephen bright 
seminole county district attorney charles ferguson had announced 
this week he would not seek the death penalty against dungee 
because of a new georgia law prohibiting execution of the mentally 
retarded 
courtordered tests he said found dungee significantly 
subaverage in intelligence 
dungee carl isaacs and wayne coleman were convicted and 
sentenced to die for murdering six members of the ned alday family 
during a robbery at the alday farm near donalsonville in seminole 
county 
the three escapees from a maryland prison killed five alday men 
shooting them at close range in a mobile home then raped and shot 
a woman in a field nearby their convictions were overturned in 
1985 
isaacs was convicted earlier this year in a retrial in houston 
county and was again sentenced to death coleman was convicted in 
dekalb county but avoided the death penalty when the jury 
deadlocked over the sentence 
bright said dungee has an iq of 6469 
his involvement was by far the least of any of those 
involved bright said theres no doubt his mental limitations 
had something to do with it

the governing council of international civil 
aviation organization today agreed that the world body should 
investigate the us downing of an iranian jetliner but it refused 
to condemn the united states for the incident 
iran wanted the icao to condemn the united states for the 
missile attack july 3 that killed 290 people only four of the 
councils 33 member nations the soviet union china 
czechoslovakia and cuba spoke in favor of condemnation 
there was no formal vote either on a condemnation or on the 
investigation 
no one spoke in dissent of irans call for an independent icao 
investigation of the disaster 
after todays meeting icao president dr assad kotaite called a 
recess in the special twoday session so members could hold private 
consulations 
the only time the icao has condemned a nation in a formal 
resolution was in 1973 when it criticized israel for attacking 
lebanese civilian aircraft icao officials said 
chinese delegate li keli called for a full and impartial 
investigation we condemn this action he said of the 
missile attack the chinese government is opposed to big power 
military involvement in the gulf region 
the united states offered its defense wednesday 
iranian vessels were attacking us naval vessels at the very 
moment that iran air 655 took off from bandar abbas us 
assistant secretary of state richard s williamson said in a 
15page defense at the opening meeting 
the plane headed straight for the scene of the conflict and 
failed to heed or even answer the repeated warnings and requests 
for identification 
some degree of responsibility must be taken by iran for 
putting its aircraft in this vulnerable position williamson 
argued 
he said the captain of the uss vincennes which the pentagon 
says mistook the iranian airliner for an f14 fighter had just 
four minutes to react and that fairminded people would find the 
captains decision reasonable in the circumstances 
williamson blamed iran for not heeding a un security council 
resolution calling for a ceasefire the 8yearold iraniraq war 
he said us forces are in the gulf only to protect naval and 
air traffic which he termed a major victim of the war 
iranian spokesman hassan shafty said the iran air airbus a300 
was exactly where it was scheduled to be when it was shot down 
ascending from bandar abbas on a 28minute scheduled flight to 
dubai 
later in answer to a soviet question williamson said the 
vincennes was aware there were scheduled flights in the area 
iran asked the icao council to form a factfinding team and 
recommend means of preventing a recurrence 
it also sought explicit condemnation of the united states 
for using weapons against a civilian airliner and demanded the end 
of obstacles restrictions threats and use of force against 
iranian air space 
the united states called for minimum altitude requirements 
unambiguous radar signals and better radio communications to ensure 
that warnings to pilots are received 
west germany and brazil were among countries urging icao to 
review provisions for coordinating military and civilian air 
traffic control 
after a majority of council members had spoken wednesday it was 
clear there was little support for political attacks on the united 
states 
us permanent representative edmund stohr said washington has 
many allies in the icao who appreciate the way us patrols have 
kept oil flowing from the persian gulf 
the soviet delegate ivan vasin read a government statement 
issued last week saying the tragedy was far from accidental he 
termed the attack a grievous international offense for which the 
united states bears full responsibility 
but soviet emphasis was on the future suggesting that a united 
nations naval force replace the us fleet in the gulf and echoing 
williamsons call for immediate action to reroute civilian air 
traffic away from gulf hot spots 
several speakers urged more countries to ratify a 1984 icao 
protocol banning the use of force against civilian aircraft only 
48 of icaos 159 member nations have ratified the amendment

an 11yearold californian the youngest pilot to 
fly the atlantic stepped from the cockpit thursday with a huge 
grin on his freckled face he was greeted by champagne toasts and a 
proud but worried mother 
were finally here we made it said christopher lee 
marshall weary but beaming as he stood on the wing of his 
singleengine mooney 252 aircraft at le bourget the same airfield 
where charles lindbergh completed the first solo transatlantic 
flight in 1927 
mommy missed you so much give me a kiss said his mother 
gail marshall of oceana calif who waved an american flag and 
handed christopher a new stuffed bear 
his old stuffed bear charles lindbeargh cuddly and blue with 
aviators helmet and goggles accompanied him on the long flight 
charles lindbergh was one of my heroes the young aviator 
told reporters so we decided on this trip then next year 
hopefully around the world 
he still wore his bright blue flight suit with a baseball cap 
reading chris marshall tour covering his strawcolored hair as 
he sipped cola at a champagne and softdrink reception inside an 
airport hangar 
unlike lindbergh christopher made several stops between new 
york and paris in canada greenland iceland and scotland and 
had company and emergency help from retired navy pilot randy 
cunningham 46 their trip started in san diego on july 7 
i didnt want to take an 11yearold boy and make him fly for 
20 hours straight cunningham said i had a hard enough time 
having him fly eight hours a day and keeping him awake you know an 
11yearold boy wants to go to sleep when he gets tired 
christophers mother and friends who helped plan the trip said 
they did not know who the previous youngest pilot to fly the 
atlantic might have been but they were confident no one younger 
had done it 
cunningham said the youngster who will enter fifth grade this 
fall is a very talented pilot he flies better than some of the 
adults ive flown with 
he first went into a cockpit when he was 4 years old with his 
father an airline pilot and began flying with an instructor when 
he was 7 
last year he became the youngest pilot to fly across the united 
states but the record already has been broken christopher said he 
was glad even younger kids have followed his example 
im an ambassador to the youth of america and im showing all 
kids across america that they can go out and accomplish their 
dreams he said 
the scariest moment of the flight came early wednesday when the 
planes oil pressure fell and its engine began overheating in bad 
weather between greenland and reykjavik iceland 
cunningham took the controls for the return to the southeast 
coast of greenland and had to pick his way through mountains to a 
small airfield at kulusuk where clouds were just 100 feet off the 
ground 
only one of a million pilots could have made that landing and 
he did christopher said we came so close to dying 
i didnt think wed make it through we had to fly at 50 feet 
off the ground because there were mountains and it was 
quartermile visibility and all the ocean was iced up it was 
neat 
the former navy pilot said christopher was not exaggerating the 
danger they had faced 
i went back in the clouds and came back down and then went 
back around the mountains for about 20 minutes trying to find the 
runway desperately he said i didnt think i was going to 
live 
because cunningham only flew the plane while it was 
backtracking he and christopher both consider the youngster to 
have been the pilot for a complete transatlantic crossing 
mrs marshall said she worried throughout the voyage while 
waiting at a paris hotel room but didnt realize until later how 
frightening the experience could be for her son 
if i knew i dont think i would have let him go she said 
after engine repairs in greenland christopher took the controls 
again for the flight to reykjavik then on to glasgow scotland 
where they stayed wednesday night before the final leg to paris

publication of search warrant affidavits in 
the probe of defense industry fraud could prompt destruction of 
evidence said prosecutors in opposing efforts by two newspaper 
publishers to unseal the papers 
revealing the contents of the affidavits may well encourage 
document destruction and other acts that would have the practical 
effect of putting major felons beyond the reach of justice us 
attorney henry hudson of the eastern district of virginia said in a 
brief filed wednesday 
the times mirror co group publisher of the los angeles times 
and copley press inc publisher of the san diego union and the 
tribune joined last week in efforts to have the affidavits made 
public 
the newspaper organizations petitioned to unseal all documents 
relating to search warrants executed june 14 at southern california 
offices of the northrop corp teledyne industries litton 
industries and the los angeles home of defense consultant fred 
lackner 
a hearing is scheduled friday before a us magistrate on 
motions made by the news media organizations 
the prosecutors contended that disclosure of the information 
which includes details of wiretaps and was used to persuade judges 
to approve search warrants could prompt destruction of evidence 
and might encourage selective amnesia among witnesses 
in the short time since the execution of the search warrants 
became public the government has already become aware of several

the city council has voted 
unanimously including a black councilman to name one of its city 
parks in honor of former mayor james r venable a ku klux klan 
leader 
black councilman robert smith said he voted for the designation 
because venable had donated the land for the park and said the 
attorneys klan membership was not my concern 
but coleman seward of the dekalb county branch of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people said he thought 
the decision was awful 
recreation director barbara holladay said venable a former 
imperial wizard of the national knights of the ku klux klan 
donated the land to the city in the early 1970s she said the 
council voted tuesday to name the park for venable while we were 
going through the master plan for parks and recreation 
council members wanted to do it while he is still living 
she said 
we feel he should be recognized for giving the land to the 
city said mayor jane l rhodes 
gloria brown a black community leader said that despite his 
klan activities many black residents of the city think of venable 
as just another resident 
many black people have worked for him and he has been very 
good to them she said

big banks raised their prime lending rate today 
to the highest level in more than two years a halfpercentage 
point rise to 95 percent signaling more expensive loans for 
consumers and businesses 
it was the second boost in the key lending rate this year and 
reflected the banks own costs of borrowing money which has been 
rising steadily over the past few months 
the prime is watched closely because bankers use it as a basis 
for calculating loans to businesses and for determining many types 
of fixed and adjustablerate consumer loans including popular 
homeequity loans 
chase manhattan bank in new york was the first to announce the 
rate increase and was quickly followed by other big banks 
including citibank first national bank of chicago bank of new 
york and manufacturers hanover 
the last increase in the prime was on may 11 from 85 percent 
to 9 percent the increase today put the prime at the highest point 
since march 1986 
reaction in the financial markets was muted partly because a 
rise had been widely expected on wall street the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials was off less than a point to the 2104 
level by late morning 
in the bond market a sensitive barometer of the economy and 
interest rate trends the treasurys key 30year bond was down 
slightly in price raising its yield to 918 percent from 917 
percent late wednesday 
the prime rate rise came one day after federal reserve chairman 
alan greenspan warned he would move to tighten credit if inflation 
started to accelerate 
testifying in congress greenspan said the fed at this 
juncture might be well advised to err more on the side of 
restrictiveness rather than stimulus 
there has been growing evidence that inflation could rise 
significantly this year low unemployment strains on americas 
productive capacities and rising commodity prices caused by the 
drought point to higher consumer prices in the months ahead 
many economists have predicted that interest rates would rise 
slightly this year but do not believe the increase will be dramatic

democratic national chairman paul kirk said today 
that jesse jackson and michael dukakis had spoken within the last 
24 hours and that two campaigns were continuing to talk although 
platform negotiations remain broken off 
i know there has been a conversation between the two 
candidates and several conversations between the two campaigns 
kirk said so i think well be moving forward to make sure there 
are continuing discussions and hopefully well be able to resolve 
any differences on substantive matters 
a day earlier jacksons convention manager ron brown 
disappointed over dukakis selection of sen lloyd bentsen for his 
running mate and angered that jackson learned of the selection from 
the press said the campaign had broken off talks over 13 still 
disputed platform issues 
asked if there are ongoing talks about the platform kirk said 
at this moment there are not the effort between the two 
campaigns is to assure there will be 
he said dukakis called jackson within the last 24 hours 
he said dukakis wanted to make sure that any 
misunderstandings about how jackson was informed of the decision 
were resolved i think its just one of those matters of 
timing and certainly wasnt intended as a signal of disrespect or 
insensitivity the chairman said 
kirk said he spoke with jackson to explain his own role in 
introducing dukakis and bentsen and the press conference announcing 
bentsens selection in boston on tuesday when kirk presented them 
as the 1988 party ticket 
i talked with jackson about that myself and i said the numbers 
were clear in terms of the presidential nomination the choice had 
been made with respect to the vice presidential nomination that 
the party was anxious to direct its attention and its effort 
against the republicans in november without in any way turning our 
back on the important contribution rev jackson has and will 
continue to make to that effort 
he cited the reality of the numbers and added i think 
its important for me and my role to continue to keep the focus on 
the november election the quicker all of us can close ranks 
and button up the unified democratic party i think its in the 
greater interest of succeeding in the fall 
kirk said jackson listened and added he might have had a 
different point of view 
kirk also announced the addition of four speakers to the 
convention program sen sam nunn dga on defense and national 
security issues sen wyche fowler dga on keeping a senate 
majority gov gerald baliles of virginia representing the 
democratic governors and sen bill bradley dnj on the role of

vice president george bush today called 
the accidental us destruction of an iranian airliner carrying 290 
people a terrible human tragedy but told the un security 
council that iran shares in the responsibility 
presenting the us case in the security councils debate on the 
downing of iran air flight 655 bush defended the us naval 
presence in the persian gulf as our legal right iran which 
asked for a council condemnation of the us action was 
represented by its foreign minister aliakbar velayati 
bush said that iran allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with 
passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle 
that was irresponsible and a tragic error 
velayati charged that the attack had been premeditated 
this was the most inhuman military attack in the history of 
civil aviation he said accusing the united states of 
arrogance indifference and a campaign of lies to justify 
this barbaric crime at any cost 
this was a premeditated act of aggression against the 
integrity of tehran a massacre he said 
the vice president said he would not dignify with a response 
the charge that we deliberately destroyed iran air 655 
and he said that velayati knows better 
bush called the persian gulf a region of vital importance to 
the united states and the economy of the world he said the us 
presence in the gulf was intended to help ensure the flow of oil 
and protect neutral commerce this is our legal right he said 
bush accused iran of reckless behavior toward neutral ships 
engaged in lawful commerce 
bush as he has done repeatedly over the last few days defended 
the captain of the uss vincennes one thing is clear he said 
the uss vincennes acted in selfdefense in firing two missiles 
at the jetliner which it had deduced was an iranian f14 fighter 
closing in on the cruiser 
bush called on iran to immediately divert civilian air traffic 
away from areas of active hostilities and to join with iraq in 
accepting an immediate ceasefire in the war that has raged since 
1980 
the victims of iran air 655 are only most recent casualties of 
a brutal and senseless war that has brought immense pain and 
suffering to the people of both sides bush said 
bush said he came to the united nations where he served as 
ambassador from 1971 to 1973 at the request of president reagan 
because of the importance of the issues at stake 
bush said it was not just the terrible human tragedy of iran 
air 655 but the continuing conflict between iran and iraq that 
brought him to speak 
speaking with reporters on air force two as he flew to new york 
bush said he had been selected because the president decided to 
put some real emphasis on the policy of the united states by 
elevating the level of representation 
the appearance is likely to give the prospective republican 
presidential nominee high visibility at a time when democrats are 
preparing to nominate michael dukakis as their presidential 
candidate 
however presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagans 
selection of bush reflects the importance of the issues at 
stake and was not made for political reasons 
the speech is bushs first speech to the security council since 
he was ambassador under president nixon un officials said no 
us vice president had addressed the council in recent memory 
in the days following the shooting down of the airliner bush 
was outspoken in his defense of the captain of the us cruiser 
vincennes will rogers iii calling the episode in the persian gulf 
just an unhappy incident and telling audiences repeatedly 
life goes on 
the united states has said it will offer compensation to the 
families of the victims but that the mechanics and amount of the 
offer have not been determined 
meanwhile campaign aides said that bush over the next few days 
would settle on a process of selecting a running mate now that the 
democratic ticket has been completed with dukakis selection of 
sen lloyd bentsen of texas 
bush also decided to maintain a low profile during the early 
days of the democratic convention extending a planned threeday 
fishing trip with treasury secretary james a baker iii to five 
days 
baker who managed bushs 1980 presidential campaign and oversaw 
president reagans 1984 reelection campaign is expected to resign 
his post later this summer to become bushs campaign chairman 
the vice president plans to make his vice presidential choice 
privately and intends to avoid divulging it until the republican 
national convention in midaugust said spokeswoman sheila tate 
bush plans to campaign from late wednesday through the following 
weekend with appearances scheduled in detroit north carolina 
south carolina new jersey tennessee florida and new mexico

americans in two public opinion polls strongly 
defended the united states for shooting down an iranian passenger 
plane early this month although both surveys were conducted before 
many details were known 
in an abc newswashington post poll conducted july 5 two days 
after the incident 71 percent of respondents said the us action 
was justified and 74 percent said iran overall was more to blame 
for the incident 
in a usa todaycable news network poll conducted the same day 
75 percent said the shooting was justified based on what was known 
at the time and 61 percent said iran was more responsible than the 
united states for the incident 
immediate oneday polls such as these often measure visceral 
reactions rather than thoughtful opinion their sample sizes are 
about half that of most national surveys 
the united states initially claimed that the iran air jet with 
290 people aboard was outside a commercial air lane when a navy 
warship shot it down the united states later withdrew that claim 
after the polls had been conducted 
the navy has said its warship the uss vincennes mistook the 
jet for an iranian f14 fighter and that it fired after the jet 
failed to respond to repeated radio warnings it has said the jet 
took off an hour later and appeared to be descending in what was 
seen as a hostile flight pattern 
the british intelligence agency reportedly has supported irans 
claim that the jet took off on time and was climbing not 
descending when it was shot down that report also came after the 
polls were conducted 
in other findings in the abcpost poll 72 percent said the 
downing was an understandable accident rather than a stupid 
mistake 80 percent said the captain of the vincennes acted 
properly and 61 percent opposed us payments to families of the 
victims in the usa todaycnn poll 48 percent opposed financial 
compensation to the families 
the abcpost poll was conducted by telephone among 524 adults

sen john h chafee has become the third 
rhode island politician in danger of losing his ballot position 
because of a minor problem on his candidacy papers 
john j staradumsky an independent candidate for chafees seat 
has filed a formal objection to chafees candidacy meaning the 
state board of elections must decide whether to throw chafee off 
the ballot board chairman joseph r distefano said wednesday 
the twoterm republican senator listed his warwick address on 
his filing form as 1128 ives road while his voter registration 
card omits the house number state law requires the two forms to 
match exactly 
similar discrepancies already have jeopardized the candidacies 
of republican rep claudine schneider and democratic gubernatorial 
candidate bruce g sundlun gov edward d diprete said at the time 
he would call a special session of the general assembly if 
necessary to get them back on the ballot 
michael ryan a chafee aide said wednesday homes on ives road 
were not numbered when chafee registered to vote in 1953 
we expect common sense to prevail hopefully in all cases but 
certainly in this one ryan said 
the elections board will hear chafees case july 26 it has 
scheduled a july 25 hearing on the schneider and sundlun cases 
if the board rules against chafee he would hae to run a 
writein campaign against democrat richard a licht in the nov 8 
general election chafee is unopposed for renomination 
distefano has refused to predict what his board will do but 
said it has ruled time and time again against lesserknown 
candidates who made similar mistakes 
everybody knows what the precedents are he said weve 
indicated that quite clearly

a newborn taken from her hospital crib 
two days ago was back in her parents arms today after fbi agents 
arrested an ohio woman on charges of kidnapping the child by posing 
as a nurse officials said 
the woman linda lou german had called an abduction hotline and 
insisted the child was hers then came to the hospital with the 
baby a prosecutor said german 26 of wheelersburg ohio was 
charged with a federal count of kidnapping which carries a 
sentence of up to life in prison said assistant us attorney 
joseph savage jr 
german who has a 3yearold daughter had endured some sort 
of trauma and she wanted a baby of her own said janet 
ferguson a spokesman at cabell huntington hospital 
prosecutors said german will undergo a psychiatric examination 
arraignment scheduled for this morning was delayed without 
explanation 
threedayold lindsey manns was in good health at the hospital 
ferguson said 
savage said german had called an abduction hotline at 9 pm 
wednesday saying she had an infant and my relatives dont 
believe its mine 
german arrived at the hospital with the baby wednesday night and 
told fbi agents she had given birth in early july at a lexington 
ky hospital the prosecutor said 
the fbi called the hospital where there was no record of the 
birth and a doctors exam determined she hadnt given birth 
recently he said 
the infant was taken tuesday from cabell huntington hospitals 
thirdfloor maternity ward officials said they believed the 
kidnapper wearing a nurses uniform carried the baby through the 
front door 
on wednesday donald and linda manns had tearfully pleaded for 
the return of their daughter 
id just like to say whoevers got it please bring it 
back donald manns said just call and tell us its all right 
the prosecutor said german was believed to have been involved in 
an attempted abduction sunday of another baby born at the same 
hospital no charges have been filed in that case he said 
in that case a woman told state police that after she delivered 
her baby at the hospital she received a visit from a stranger who 
told her she had recently lost a newborn baby 
the mother told police that the woman showed up at her home in 
mingo county with a gift for the baby 
once inside police were told the woman was allowed to hold the 
baby then brandished a knife and threatened to take the infant 
state police said the intruder fled when another person walked into 
the room 
we suspect a connection between the two incidents because of 
the time frame and the fact that both incidents involve babies born 
at the same hospital said sgt fh butler

a cuban official today denied that 
agreement was reached in principle for cuba to withdraw its troops 
from angola the statement contradicted a us announcement 
i would say it is not precise to say that an agreement has 
been reached on the withdrawal of cuban troops said alcibiades 
hidalgo a member of the policymaking central committee of cubas 
communist party 
this issue is part of all the discussions is part of a 
process that is continuing i would qualify it as inexact to say 
that an agreement has been reached on the withdrawal of all cuban 
troops he added 
it is our opinion that we made substantial progress he 
said speaking in spanish through an interpreter 
on wednesday chester a crocker undersecretary of state in 
charge of african affairs said that angolan cuban and south 
african delegates agreed that pretoria would end its 73year rule 
in southwest africa and that cuban troops would leave angola 
crocker said no schedule was set for the pullout 
as a result of these 2 days the angolans cubans and south 
africans were able to reach agreement on a set of principles which 
constitute the essential elements of a political settlement in 
southwestern africa said crocker who led the host american 
delegation at talks that began monday 
hidalgo was not the most senior member of the cuban delegation 
it was led by carlos aldana another member of the partys central 
committee he did not appear at todays press conference 
crocker said the south african administration in southwest 
africa also known as namibia would be replaced by un civil and 
military administrators to comply with a un resolution calling 
for that nations independence under black majority rule 
there are some large gaps that remain crocker said for 
example the existing gap on the timing of the cuban troop 
withdrawal from angola is a major issue i think the parties agreed 
that this was not the time to come to grips with that issue and we 
agree with that judgment 
crocker said details of the principles would not be released 
until approval by their respective governments 
south africa has said it would accept a un security council 
resolution calling for southwest africas independence when the 
estimated 50000 cuban troops withdraw from neighboring angola 
the us goal is a full cuban troop withdrawal in one year the 
same time span that the un resolution sets for granting 
independence to namibia 
angola and cuba had insisted that the cuban withdrawal should 
take place over four years 
in washington today un ambassador vernon walters told cbs 
this morning that many obstacles remain including obtaining 
approval of the governments involved and setting a schedule for the 
troop withdrawals 
this war has been going on for 15 years theres a whole lot 
of hostility built up he said 
the united states was a party to the talks because it has been 
supporting anticommunist rebels in angola with funds and weapons 
since 1985 
asked if the united states would still support the rebels 
walters said thats a decision taken in the light of 
circumstances certainly the soviets are still supporting the 
luanda government 
private meetings among the negotiators began monday under tight 
security at the us coast guard station on governors island in new 
york harbor 
both the angolan and south african delegates expressed optimism 
during the talks a marked contrast to the usual rancor and 
recriminations in statements about each other 
angola has been convulsed by civil war since it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 the marxist oneparty 
government has been fighting the anticommunist rebels in the 
south who call themselves unita for national union for the total 
independence of angola 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops across the border from 
namibia into angola to support the unita rebel forces in their 
clashes with cuban and angolan forces 
namibia has been ruled by south africa since world war i when 
the league of nations gave it a mandate to administer the 
territory the leagues successor the united nations has revoked 
that mandate

state law allows lloyd bentsen to appear on 
the texas ballot as a candidate for both vice president and 
reelection to the senate giving him a chance to protect his 
senate seat from the republicans at least for the time being 
i cant get off the ticket in texas thats the way the law is 
written democrat bentsen says if i was to step off the 
ticket that would forfeit it to the republican challenger and i 
cant do that 
bentsens bid for a fourth senate term is being challenged by 
republican rep beau boulter a twoterm conservative from 
amarillo who has been fighting an uphill battle in the race 
boulter is making as much as he can of bentsens dual candidacy 
declaring its wrong its unethical and its going to raise 
questions throughout this campaign 
michael dukakis the expected democratic presidential nominee 
picked bentsen on tuesday to be his running mate 
that put bentsen in a tworace campaign thats allowed under a 
1959 state law written for thensen lyndon b johnson who wanted 
it so he could run for both reelection and the white house his 
presidential bid failed but he became john kennedys vice 
president and later became president after kennedy was assassinated 
texas secretary of state jack rains the states chief election 
officer says withdrawal by bentsen now would give the senate race 
to republican boulter bentsen could remove his name from the 
senate ballot before sept 6 but the democrats could not replace 
him 
if bentsen wins both elections he would have to choose one post 
or the other if he gave up his senate seat as expected 
republican gov bill clements would name an interim senator and 
then call a special election to pick someone to complete the 
sixyear term 
the special election rains said would be a florida scramble 
everyone just goes out and tees it up 
interest is already high and rising 
on tuesday lt gov bill hobby said he would certainly 
seriously consider running if such a special election takes place 
on wednesday state agriculture commissioner jim hightower said 
i am like every other person of voting age in texas considering 
making the senate race hightower already had been looking at a 
1990 race against republican sen phil gramm 
among other democrats looking at entering the senate scramble 
are former gov mark white and reps mike andrews and mickey 
leland both of houston and john bryant of dallas attorney 
general jim mattox also has expressed interest 
on the republican side reps jack fields of houston and steve 
bartlett of dallas have shown interest 
the 1961 special election to replace johnson in the senate drew 
more than 70 candidates republican john tower won

departing attorney general edwin meese iii 
will join the heritage foundation next month to write and lecture 
on issues ranging from drugs to the constitution the conservative 
washington research center said thursday 
meese the subject of a justcompleted 14month criminal 
investigation said he looks forward to a more reflective period 
without the white heat and daily pressures of government work 
when he joins the heritage foundation as a distinguished fellow 
meese also will be a distinguished visiting fellow at the 
hoover institution at stanford university in palo alto calif the 
justice department said 
heritage foundation president edward feulner called meese one 
of the conservative movements most valuable resources 
hoover institution president glenn campbell said it will be 
very good to have mr meese in our coffee room so that scholars 
learn that translating their ideas into policy and programs isnt 
quite as simple as they think it is 
at the heritage foundation executive vice president phil 
truluck said ed meese more than anyone is symbolic of the ideas 
of the reagan revolution and were pleased that hes come to 
heritage to continue to fight for those ideas 
in articles lectures and roundtable discussions meese will 
address questions concerning drugs criminal justice and the 
constitution but will delve into other areas in view of his broad 
experience as head of the reagan administrations domestic policy 
council said truluck 
meese was counselor to president reagan from 1981 to 1985 before 
becoming attorney general truluck said meeses articles will be 
printed in heritage publications and placed in other journals 
the heritage foundation and the hoover institution have hosted 
several former reagan administration officials 
secretary of state george shultz has already agreed to join the 
hoover institution staff after he leaves office 
meese announced july 5 that he would leave the administration by 
next month he said he had been vindicated in a criminal probe of 
his activities because independent counsel james mckay had decided 
not to seek his indictment 
mckay filed an 830page report that is to be made public 
shortly it was referred last week to solicitor general charles 
fried a step that could lead to an ethics review of meese by the 
justice departments office of professional responsibility 
meese has worked for reagan longer than any other aide joining 
him when reagan was elected governor of california in 1966 and 
working as a senior staff member until 1974 
he taught at the university of california school of law in 
berkeley from 1965 to 1967 and was director of the center for 
criminal justice policy and management at the university of san 
diego from 1977 to 1981 
meanwhile thursday richard thornburgh president reagans 
nominee to become attorney general said he will soon talk to top 
justice department officials about improving morale following 
meeses departure 
i want to take a very careful look at what the level of 
commitment and what the level of morale is within the department 
thornburgh said on nbctvs today program 
i hope within the next week or so to begin some conversations 
with key people in the department so i can make that assessment of 
morale and we can deal with whatever problems exist there said 
thornburgh who was interviewed from boston

michael dukakis telephoned jesse jackson in an 
attempt to improve their strained relations according to the 
democratic party chairman who today predicted a resolution of 
differences that threatened to disrupt the national convention next 
week 
dukakis plans for a show of unity have been clouded by 
jacksons hints that he might challenge the selection of sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas for the no 2 spot on the ticket 
the massachusetts governor phoned jackson within the last 24 
hours to ensure that any misunderstandings about how jackson was 
informed of bentsens selection were resolved said paul kirk 
democratic national committee chairman jackson first learned of 
the selection from reporters not dukakis 
i think its just one of those matters of timing and 
certainly wasnt intended as a signal of disrespect or 
insensitivity the chairman said 
jackson hinted wednesday that he might challenge dukakis 
selection of bentsen at the convention 
asked in chicago if there would be a floor fight next thursday 
when the convention is asked to ratify dukakis choice jackson 
said im not suggesting that i will compete for a place on the 
ticket but the floor is wide open on thursday night when the 
recommendation is made 
informed of jacksons comments dukakis said im confident 
well have a united convention 
kirk acknowledged that negotiations on the platform are still 
stalled and he said he had personally talked to jackson to explain 
his role in the tuesday announcement of bentsen as dukakiss 
running mate 
despite the problems the party chairman said i think well 
be moving forward to make sure there are continuing discussions and 
hopefully well be able to resolve any differences on substantive 
matters 
on wednesday dukakis drawing an obvious contrast to republican 
rival george bushs service in the reagan administration says he 
would expect his vice president to challenge me and spell out 
differences on issues and policies 
at a capitol hill news conference dukakis and bentsen 
acknowledged they differ on some issues but insisted they were in 
broad agreement on job creation education fair housing and health 
care 
dukakis and bentsen met with reporters after a day of joint 
appearances in the nations capital during which they tried to 
dampen discontent among blacks angry over the fact that jackson 
received no advance notice of the selection of bentsen 
after a fundraiser at the georgetown home of pamela harriman 
dukakis returned to boston and the struggle to find about 100 
million in cuts to bring his state budget into balance 
his state budget problems are a potential embarrassment to 
dukakis as he prepares to accept the democratic presidential 
nomination at the partys national convention next week in atlanta 
his abilities as a manager and the robust economy of his state 
have been cornerstones of dukakis campaign to convince voters he 
is the most qualified presidential candidate 
dukakis and bentsen were asked repeatedly about their 
differences on such questions as abortion school prayer contra 
aid and the 1981 tax cuts proposed by president reagan 
as long hes a us senator from texas hes going to vote his 
conscience said the massachusetts governor 
then he added if we are elected in november then obviously 
the relationship will change 
bentsen had no argument with that assessment 
as vice president of the united states i would give him the 
very best counsel i could when i agreed or disagreed on the 
issues said the texas senator but theres only one president 
of the united states and hes the man that bears the ultimate 
responsibility and pays the ultimate price 
dukakis said one of the reasons i picked lloyd bentsen is 
because i know he will challenge me as vice president 
the massachusetts governor also seemed determined to contrast 
what he would expect from a vice president to the perception that 
bush often has played a passive role in that office at least so 
far as can be gleaned from the public record 
bush told reporters in california last spring i hold back 
speaking in meetings because i dont want the president tohave to 
be choosing between his vice president and the other members of the 
cabinet and i hold back sometimes because i worry about leaks 
the prospective democratic ticket got a cool reception during a 
joint appearance at the annual convention of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people but dukakis 
said i thought it was terrific 
i understand there were a great many people in that room who 
are actively involved in the jackson candidacy who cared very 
deeply about it and are disappointed he didnt win he said 
the reception was no different than a greekamerican group would 
give jackson if he appeared before them after defeating dukakis in 
a race for the nomination he said

theres nothing like a presidential visit 
into droughtravaged territory to get the rains falling again at 
least in the eyes of farmer herman krone 
it just tickles me to death said krone who today hosted 
president reagan at his 2800acre farm in southern illinois if 
he reagan can make it rain hes done enough for me 
reagan walked through corn and soybean fields on the farm 
towering over the corn normally 8 feet high by now but today less 
than half that height soybean plants were a quarter of their 
expected size 
what i saw was not a pretty sight reagan said 
the nearly 2 inches of rain recorded on krones farm this week 
is turning onceparched fields into muddy pastures and 25 miles 
away in marion motorists have been driving through flooded 
downtown streets 
four or five days ago my corn looked like pineapples 
leaves dying the 63yearold krone a reagan admirer said 
wednesday 
until mondays rain sporadic showers have soaked the area 
since the grass would just crack under your feet he said 
the grass is starting to come back and if i can get some 
continued rain i could get some recovery on my pastures 
todays forecast called for mostly sunny skies hot and humid 
conditions with highs in the 90s 
agriculture experts however insist that recent rain up to 4 
inches over some of the flatland region wont help much of the 
already damaged corn crop 
but the presidents visit they say is a good gesture on 
reagans part and should help get federal aid for farmers who have 
substantial crop loss 
myself im not looking for a handout said krone who added 
that he doesnt receive any federal subsidies i can survive if 
theres no rain and it the drought continues 
even so at the krone farm reagan saw some 400 acres of a 
1200acre corn crop that is irreversibly damaged by drought an 
estimated 35000 loss 
corn stalks that should be 10 to 12feet high by this time of 
year only measure from 2 to 5feet with burnt brownish tassels 
the farmer said 
the dry spell also has parched 125 acres of pasture used to feed 
krones 150 head of cattle for the past month hes had to feed 
the cattle alfalfa hay 
my farm will be a good representation of the drought although 
it has rained here said krone dressed in a blueandbeige 
agratech cap a gray tshirt faded blue jeans and leather work 
boots 
reagan was scheduled for stops in moline ill and neighboring 
davenport iowa before returning to washington dc 
even though it has rained when the president looks at the 
crops hes going to see a bad situation said steve newman of 
the illinois farm bureau theres nothing like looking at the 
problem square in the face and making some decisions 
bob spitze professor of agriculture economics at the university 
of illinois said the reagan visit adds support to a 55 billion 
reliefdrought package under consideration by congress 
now that the administration has said the condition has 
worsened enough it is a major catastrophe and we need 
legislation it legitimizes the reliefdrought package which has 
already been developed he said

said they value a candidates personal style over his position on 
the issues while 79 percent said issues were more important

percent and again the parties were ranked equally in their ability 
to handle it dealing with foreign trade rated fourth went to the 
republicans 4232 
on social issues more than a third of respondents said illegal

percent and better on aids 3320 percent 
republicans were rated better 4024 on dealing with crime the

last two issues the environment 4920 and civil rights 5612 
on foreign affairs a fifth of respondents said ussoviet 
relations was the key issue a fifth said it was the spread of 
nuclear weapons and nearly a fifth said it was unrest in the middle

iran told the security council today that 
the united states committed a barbaric crime in shooting down 
an iranian airliner and denied us claims that the navy warned the 
jetliner before the attack 
iranian foreign minister aliakbar velayati in an angry speech 
accused the united states of a premeditated attack on the airliner 
with 290 people aboard and demanded the withdrawal of us forces 
from the persian gulf 
this was the most inhuman military attack in the history of 
civil aviation he said 
he accused the united states of arrogance indifference and a 
campaign of lies to justify this barbaric crime at any cost 
this was a premeditated act of aggression against the 
integrity of tehran a massacre he said 
vice president george bush called the accident a terrible 
human tragedy but told the security council that iran shares the 
responsibility 
the critical issue is not the how and why of iran air 655 
bush said it is the continuing refusal of the government of iran 
to comply with a un ceasefire resolution to negotiate an end 
to the war with iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against 
neutral shipping in the persian gulf 
he said iran allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with 
passengers to proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle 
that was irresponsible and a tragic error 
the meeting was requested by iran which sought a condemnation 
of the united states it adjourned after velayati and bush spoke 
and was scheduled to resume friday 
iran also sought a condemnation of the united states from the 
governing council of the international civil aviation organization 
the council agreed today in montreal that the world body should 
investigate the incident but only four of the 33 members china 
the soviet union cuba and czechoslovakia spoke in favor of us 
condemnation 
diplomats said the 15member security council was not in 
agreement on a resolution or statement that would be acceptable to 
all parties and would not be vetoed by the united states as one of 
the councils five permanent members the united states has veto 
power 
velayati quoted the radio transcript of recordings between 
flight 655 and control towers and said it shows that contrary to 
the us version the plane never received warnings from the 
vincennes on july 3 
it was traveling in an established civilian air corridor and 
transmitting an internationally recognized signal to identify 
itself claiming mistaken identity is absurd velayati said 
he rebutted us claims that the plane was descending in an 
attack mode that it was transmitting ambiguous civilian and 
military signals and that it was outside a recognized air corridor 
the navy said the cruisers crew mistook the a300 airbus for a 
fighter jet and the plane ignored radioed warnings 
velayati said the council should compel the united states and 
all foreign forces to leave the gulfanything less would be a 
further evasion of responsibilitry by the security council 
the appearance of bush a former un ambassador was considered 
a major gesture of hopes for better relations with iran after 
nearly nine years of hostility a us vice president has not 
addressed the council in years 
bush was us ambassador to the united nations under former 
president richard nixon from 1971 to 1973 this is believed to be 
his first appearance at the un since president reagan has 
appeared six times 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater denied any political 
motivation for the appearance by bush the presumed republican 
presidential nominee 
the vice president does not normally appear before the 
security council and in this way we can again highlight our 
position fitzwater said 
the united states already has expressed deep regret for the 
attack and promised compensation to the families of the victims 
but not to the iranian government 
the united states broke diplomatic relations with iran in 
november 1979 after iranian revolutionaries stormed the us 
embassy in tehran and took americans hostage holding them for more 
than a year 
but both iran and the united states clearly want to avoid a 
bitter public confrontation in the security council and both sides 
have been restrained in their statements here and elsewhere 
the united states has backed off from its call for the council 
to impose a mandatory global arms embargo against iran 
secretary of state george p shultz has said that before the 
airliner was shot down iranian officials had sent probes about 
opening a dialogue with the united states 
in tehran the no 2 leader parliament speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani has urged moderation and restraint and opposed violent 
retaliation for the us attack he previously has said iran must 
stop offending the international community end its isolation and 
gain political friends and trading partners

the commerce department said thursday that retail sales rose a 
moderate 05 percent to a seasonally adjusted 1328 billion last 
month it said sales rose 03 in may an upward revision from the 
previous estimate of 01 percent 
much of the strength in june came at department stores and other 
general merchandise outlets where sales jumped 187 percent to 
152 billion the strongest gain since last august when the 
increase was 194 percent 
in a report last week major department stores had reported 
strong sales of air conditioners summer clothes barbecue 
equipment and sporting goods 
i think what were seeing is the upside of the current weather 
situation said james newton head of economic perspectives inc 
a delaware ohio consulting firm 
in the short term the heat is helping boost sales of all 
kinds of things lawn furniture sprinkling systems also by 
this time generally retailers would be heavily marking down summer 
clothing they havent had to do that newton said 
automotive sales also were strong posting a 12 percent gain to 
297 billion they had been off 08 percent in may and 11 percent 
in april 
excluding autos the june sales increase was 03 percent down 
from a 06 percent gain in may 
offsetting increases at auto showrooms and department stores 
were declines in two areas linked to the housing market which has 
been softening this year 
sales of building supply materials and hardware dropped 10 
percent and furniture sales were off 05 percent 
overall analysts said the moderate june increase should ease 
fears in the financial markets that a toostrong economy poses the 
danger of inflation 
this is confirmation that consumers certainly havent 
retrenched to a serious degree said sandra shaber an economist 
with the futures group in washington but on the other hand 
theres no sign that consumers are going to heat up prices 
for the first six months of the year overall sales were up 64 
percent over the same period a year ago however excluding autos 
first half sales were up only 46 percent barely ahead of the 44 
percent consumer inflation rate for january through may 
real retail sales adjusting for increases in the prices of 
consumer goods have really been extremely flat said david levy 
of levy economic forecasts of chappaqua ny the retail sector 
is one of the weakest sectors in the economy right now 
sales of durable goods the big ticket items expected to 
last more than three years were up 05 percent sales of 
nondurable goods rose 06 percent 
there was gains of 16 percent at specialty clothing stores 04 
percent at restaurants and bars and 03 percent at gasoline 
stations 
food and grocery store sales were down 04 percent a surprise 
to some economists who expected droughtrelated price increases to 
inflate sales figures drug store sales were down 05 percent

economycar buyers will be the first to 
benefit from a less expensive safety innovation developed by 
general motors corp a steering wheel that flattens itself 
against the drivers torso in an accident 
gm president robert stempel said wednesday that gm is 
introducing its new selfaligning steering wheel on the 1989 
chevrolet cavalier the device will be phased in later on other 
cars not equipped with more expensive airbags 
the wheel is a hollow hub on six metal tabs that collapse on 
impact distributing the force evenly and reducing the potential 
for head and chest injuries the automaker said 
most cars equipped with airbags have tended to be more expensive 
models because economy car buyers are less willing to pay the cost 
of an airbag stempel said 
spokeswoman jane mott said today gm would not divulge how much 
the steering wheels or airbags would add to the cost 
automakers are required by the federal government to have 
passive restraints either driverside airbags in addition to 
manual shoulderlap belts or automatic shoulder belts by 1990 
gm the nations no 1 automaker will include driverside 
airbags as standard equipment on 500000 middle and upperrange 
cars a year by 1990 stempel said 
stempel said gm wont begin including passengerside airbags as 
standard equipment until 1992 because the technology is still being 
developed 
he said passengerside airbags are harder to position because 
passengers tend to sit in a variety of postures especially in 
larger cars

georgia schools must provide sex education 
courses beginning in the first grade and aids education beginning 
in the sixth grade the state board of education decided thursday 
the board approved the quality core curriculum a revision that 
will bring the schools into compliance with a 1988 law making sex 
education mandatory it currently is left to school districts 
discretion 
the law stipulates courses must stress abstinence although the 
qcc language gives school systems the option of teaching methods of 
contraception in grades nine through 12 
aids education will begin in the sixth grade with instruction on 
communicable diseases the instruction is to emphasize abstinence 
from sex and drugs as the best prevention 
the law gives parents the right to prevent their children from 
participating in sex education courses 
its a monumental step for georgia and in the nation because 
we are one of the first states in the nation to have a 
statemandated curriculum said peyton williams associate 
superintendent for instruction we are excited about the equity 
it will provide in classrooms around the state 
school districts will be required to adhere to the qcc as it is 
phased in over a period of years 
state officials will encourage teachers to begin adhering to the 
guidelines this fall but the full curriculum will be phased in 
over five years when textbooks and other materials are reordered

two poor rural counties with some of 
the nations highest infant mortality rates have no one to deliver 
babies after their only obstetriciangynecologist died while 
performing surgery 
the death of dr robert x williams has forced the only public 
hospital in bullock and macon counties to refer women in labor to 
montgomery hospitals 40 miles away the administrator of bullock 
county hospital duane brookhart said thursday 
the loss of a physician is going to reduce access to health 
care particularly for the poor who cant afford to travel long 
distances for medical care said jim mcvay spokesman for the 
state department of public health 
at least 27 of alabamas 67 counties are without a hospital 
providing obstetrical services according to the alabama hospital 
association 
williams 54 collapsed with a massive heart attack and was 
pronounced dead in the operating room at the hospital in union 
springs on wednesday morning officials said 
he had nearly completed a hysterectomy when he died st 
margarets hospital in montgomery used its emergency helicopter to 
fly dr judi jehle to union springs to complete the surgery which 
was done without complications hospital spokeswoman cathy ellis 
said thursday 
the patient was given a spinal anesthesia and she was awake 
during the entire thing ms jehle said when i got there 
she seemed pretty calm but she watched the whole thing 
because of williams death we have had to cease ob 
delivery the hospital adminsitrator said 
williams was the only obstetrician in the twocounty area and 
delivered 30 to 50 babies a month he had delivered several babies 
tuesday and i could tell from his oncall room he had been at 
the hospital all night ms jehle said when i left one of the 
nurses shook her head and said he worked himself to death 
ms jehle said it was ironic she was called in to complete the 
surgery because she recently decided to give up the obstetrical 
part of her partice because of the long hours she said williams 
had been scheduled to leave on a cruise this weekend to celebrate 
his 32nd anniversary 
a family physician in macon county arvind patel also has been 
delivering babies at bullock county hospital but he cant because 
there is no longer a surgeon on call in case a caesarean section is 
needed brookhart said 
when williams died two women were at the hospital in labor 
but they were transferred by ambulance to montgomery where they 
delivered no women had been transferred thursday brookhart said 
the hospital administrator said he already is working to recruit 
another physician 
this is a relatively poor area a lot of the patients are 
medicaid and uninsured with all the other liabilities an 
obstetrician faces it is hard to recruit he said 
in 1986 alabama had the highest infant mortality rate of any 
state with 133 out of every 1000 babies dying before their first 
birthday in 1987 it dropped to 122 but complete national 
statistics are not yet available for comparison 
mcvay said bullock and macon counties have traditionally had 
one of the highest levels of infant mortality in the state 
bullock countys rate was 262 in 1986 and 51 in 1987 although 
that figure was skewed by a small number of births macon countys 
rate was 126 in 1986 and 159 in 1987 he said

a 6yearold boy told his father he wanted a 
skateboard as his reward for surviving a stray bullet fired in 
what police believe was a drugrelated shooting 
but ralph brooks jr may never walk again let alone ride a 
skateboard due to the 45caliber slug now lodged just below his 
heart doctors said thursday 
john templeton pediatric surgeon at the childrens hospital of 
philadelphia said the bullet passed through the boys spine before 
stopping half an inch from his heart he is paralyzed from the 
waist down 
doctors who praised the boys stamina said they would not remove 
the bullet unless complications developed because of the risks 
related to surgery that close to the heart 
police said the child apparently was caught in the crossfire of 
a shootout tuesday that may have been part of a feud between drug 
dealers 
police said witnesses told them lonnie summers 21 fired 
several shots at a passing car and one of them hit the boy summers 
was arrested on charges of aggravated and simple assault 
recklessly endangering another person and violating the uniform 
firearms act police said 
he was arraigned wednesday and released on 10000 bail 
officials said 
ralph was playing with one of his two sisters when the shooting 
occurred 
they shoot out there every day two or three times a day 
said lula carr a 30yearresident of the south philadelphia 
neighborhood you stay in your house and you just try not to get 
involved 
bernadine collins rushed outside when shots rang out tuesday to 
where her children and grandchildren had been sitting 20 yards 
from ralph 
its just another repeat of what happens all the time she 
said its not going to stop and this was only a baby i 
never knew a bullet could travel so far 
the boys parents kimberly and ralph sr said they held little 
hope that their sons shooting would stop the drug dealers or 
drugrelated violence 
this has happened so many times brooks said i dont 
think they feel like we feel 
the philadelphia daily news has established a trust fund to help 
finance ralphs education

the focus of the drought plaguing much of the 
nation has shifted eastward but little relief is in sight for most 
areas the national weather service reported thursday 
the new shortrange forecast through next monday calls for hot 
dry weather to expand eastward from the rockies through the ohio 
valley to the midatlantic states 
rapidly moving weather systems are expected to drag weak fronts 
along the uscanadian border possibly triggering scattered 
showers in the extreme northern plains and upper mississippi 
valley the heavy rain which has hit portions of texas is expected 
to diminish 
longterm drought conditions now cover a large area of the great 
lakes region and the ohio and tennessee valleys the agencys 
climate analysis center reported 
in addition drought conditions persist over large areas of the 
northern great plains and rocky mountains 
a 30day weather forecast issued wednesday held little hope for 
improvement and a separate climate assessment added that many 
areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a 4 percent 
chance of recovering from the drought within 3 months 
at the beginning of july 29 percent of the nation was 
undergoing severe or extreme drought the agency said 
on tuesday the agriculture department announced sharp 
reductions in the anticipated harvest of many crops because of the 
water shortage and those projections were based on the assumption 
of normal weather from here on according to department officials 
the new national weather service forecasts cast a dark cloud 
over that assumption 
the drought region now extends well into west virginia and 
includes nearly all of ohio and indiana and much of kentucky and 
tennessee the weather service drought advisory said on the other 
hand western portions of the mississippi valley have received some 
relief due to recent rains 
the drought has been accompanied by higher than normal 
temperatures over much of the nation most notably over the western 
great lakes region 
the national picture shows the current drought to be about 
equivalent to that of 1911 and still somewhat less severe than in 
several years in the 1930s or 1956 however in the midwest the 
weather service reported that large areas have experienced the 
driest apriljune period on record since 1895 
recent rains have resulted in local flooding in texas but 
nationally streamflows are below normal and even in texas are 
expected to fall back to below average levels flows in many major 
rivers remain low and continue to restrict navigation 
reservoir levels remain close to average in much of the nation 
however the weather service noted 
in addition to thursdays shortrange forecast the mediumrange 
outlook through july 23 anticipates much of the nation will remain 
hotter than normal particularly the tennessee valley lower 
midwest central and northern great plains northern rockies and 
great basin the only areas escaping heat in the forecast are the 
nations northwestern and northeastern corners and the 
louisianatexasnew mexico area 
most of the hot area is expected to be drier than normal 
although some significant rain could penetrate northwestward from 
texas into new mexico colorado and eastern wyoming

after 13 years of tearful prayers two 
vietnamese sisters were reunited with their parents and six 
siblings who worked side by side in a small restaurant to buy the 
girls freedom 
our great dream has come true a beaming nguyen van trieu 
54 said thursday at the familys restaurant kims coffee shop 
van trieu and his wife thi khanh last saw the two girls 
mychi 20 and myhanh 15 in saigon on april 30 1975 the day 
the south vieefore i die hes granted that thats for 
sure he said 
tired from their journey the daughters smiled shyly and 
repeated the word happy as their parents detailed the familys 
exodus 
the couple fled with their oldest child kymberly now 26 
leaving two sons and four daughters behind 
van trieu a military officer in south vietnam fled with 
thousands of others from his country to avoid punishment from the 
communists 
the three were taken to a refugee camp in arkansas where they 
spent several months learning english and waiting for an american 
sponsor in the fall of 1975 they were befriended by a church in 
memphis tenn and refusing welfare worked at various odd jobs 
the family sent thousands of dollars to vietnam to pay bribes 
and buy transportation for their childrens freedom two daughters 
and a son were allowed to leave vietnam in 1980 and two years 
later another son was released 
in 1982 the nguyens opened their restaurant with 20000 
borrowed from friends living in an adjoining house the entire 
family worked without pay preparing meals waiting on tables and 
washing dishes as they continued sending money to vietnam for the 
release of the two remaining children 
except for letters and a few snapshots the family had had no 
contact with mychi and myhanh who lived with their 87yearold 
maternal grandmother 
it wasnt until june that the family learned permission had been 
granted for mychi and myhanh to leave 
we had hope mychi said in vietnamese were sleeping 
here but we still think were in vietnam 
the grandmother was supposed to come too but at the last minute 
decided she wanted to die in her homeland van trieu said 
fearing lastminute complications van trieu refused to believe 
his daughters were free until he greeted them at greater pittsburgh 
international airport on wednesday night nine days after they left 
saigon now known as ho chi minh city there had been no official 
confirmation from the vietnamese government that the two had been 
allowed to leave as scheduled july 4 
the nguyens immediately recognized mychi and myhanh who were 
7 and 2 when the family was separated the girls knew their parents 
through photographs but they had never before met their youngest 
sister beatrice ann 12 who was born in the united states 
we get along real good kymberly said we thought there 
would be a lot of differences and stuff like that but it just 
seems like old times 
the family celebrated with a party at their restaurant for 
family and friends that continued into the morning on thursday 
thi khanh took her daughters shopping for clothes and on a tour of 
their new hometown 
both girls plan to earn high school diplomas while of course 
helping at the restaurant 
we have a lot of blessings van trieu said all my family 
is here thats not a dream thats a blessing

nude dancing will be one of atlantas attractions 
that visiting democrats may choose to experience next week without 
fear of official interference 
chances that atlantas nude dancing clubs might have to shut 
down prior to the democratic national convention fizzled wednesday 
when a judge delayed until next month a second round of hearings on 
the constitutionality of a new state law banning the sale of 
alcohol in such clubs 
fulton county superior court judge isaac jenrette scheduled an 
evidentiary hearing for aug 12 on the gold clubs challenge to the 
law a temporary restraining order issued june 30 will continue to 
bar enforcement of the law until jenrette issues his ruling 
the challenge now goes to jenrette rather than directly to the 
georgia supreme court because judge luther alverson who issued the 
temporary restraining order as presiding judge for the week 
refused to grant the states request for a certificate of immediate 
review 
alverson who blocked enforcement of the law with an opinion 
that it violated the state constitution later modified his ruling 
to stress that it was temporary after lawyers from the attorney 
generals office complained that they had not been given an 
opportunity to offer evidence and examine witnesses

a thirdparty presidential candidate charged that 
atlanta city officials attempted to hide their homeless problem by 
moving indigents from shacks under a viaduct near the democratic 
national convention site into cheap apartments 
the ramshackle unsafe apartments the homeless were given 
are meant to be temporary just long enough to keep this eyesore 
from spoiling the sights for the convention delegates lenora b 
fulani candidate of the new alliance party said wednesday 
ms fulani a developmental psychologist from new york will be 
the first woman placed on the ballot in all 50 states and the 
district of columbia for the nov 8 election she is the first 
black woman to receive federal matching campaign funds 
speaking on the steps of atlanta city hall ms fulani urged the 
homeless to register and vote to assert their political rights 
i believe that the solution to homelessness is an independent 
blackled and multiracialultiracial third party in america that 
stands for people instead of profits she said 
on monday city officials moved 16 homeless people from plywood 
shacks and underground tunnels to apartments officials said the 
move was for safety and security they pledged to provide the 
apartments only for 30 days

second with 596 million or 3112 percent and manuel j clouthier 
of the conservative national action party was third with 327 
million votes or 1707 percent two minor candidates accounted for 
the rest of the vote 
of 38 million registered voters 503 percent cast ballots the 
commission said government and party officials initially described 
the turnout as larger than the 75 percent in 1982 and blamed a 
heavy turnout for the slow vote count 
cardenas 54 son of the late president lazaro cardenas who is 
one of the most revered mexican leaders announced plans to tour 
the country next week after calling his supporters to a protest 
march saturday in the downtown zocalo plaza 
he said he would target regions where he considers fraud was 
the most brutal and ran roughshod on our party members 
cardenas broke from the pri last year and united the normally 
fragmented left to leap ahead of the conservative national action 
party as one of the countrys to largest opposition group 
clouthier 54 planned to start his protest rallies thursday 
afternoon in guadalajara mexicos secondlargest city then tour 
northern mexico where his party has its strongholds until july 23 
opposition representatives on the commission accused it of fraud 
and said the release of the vote totals was delayed so they could 
be doctored 
it appears that there are two mexicos said jorge amador a 
national democratic front supporter on the commission 
he said there is a modern mexico where the federal electoral 
code is respected honest results are posted and the victorious 
candidate is cardenas and a second backward mexico in which the 
federal electoral code is not known is not applied and the 
popular will is thwarted 
amadors aides carried into the commission boxes of ballots 
some of them partially burned and others he said they found in the 
streets 
it is now the task of all the competing political parties to 
accept the basic principle of democracy interior secretary 
manuel bartlett the commissions leader said at the meeting 
accept the majority verdict of the people in the terms and 
proportions with which it was expressed 
the pri has not lost a presidential or senate race or 
gubernatorial election in any of mexicos 31 states since its 
founding in 1929 
salinas who proclaimed his victory the day after the balloting 
and has been receiving congratulations from the major organizations 
making up his party throughout the week planned to meet thursday 
with all mexicos governors 
the harvardeducated economist was president miguel de la 
madrids budget secretary for five years until his nomination last 
fall as the pris candidate he promises modernization and 
political reforms will mark his sixyear term 
cardenas clouthier and fifthplace finisher rosario ibarra de 
piedra of the radical revolutionary workers party have said they 
will not recognize the winner of a fradulent election 
we will not permit an electoral fraud to continue and for a 
usurping government to take power cardenas said wednesday night 
the long wait for the final count gave rise to widespread 
speculation that the outcome was being altered 
it was not yet known whether the pri lost the twothirds 
majority required for approval of constitutional reforms in the 
chamber of deputies the lower house of congress 
the pri won 249 of the 300 directly elected seats in the chamber 
of deputies the lower house of congress the national action party 
took 31 and parties supporting cardenas took 20 
the remaining 200 seats in the chamber are assigned on the basis 
of proportion of the vote received so the pri will retain its 
majority but it was not known how many of the 200 seats it would 
get 
salinas has said he preferred a smaller but more credible 
victory to the pris traditional overwhelming margin 
the results gave 60 senate seats to the pri and four to parties 
supporting cardenas two from the federal district that is the core 
of the mexico city metropolitan area and two from his home state of 
michoacan

investment banker felix g rohatyn and a panel 
of financial experts called on congress thursday to enact 
legislation designed to stiffen government regulation of the stock 
index futures markets 
but the bill introduced last week by rep edward markey 
dmass drew a wary response from several members of the house 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee of which markey is 
chairman markey conceded the measure may not have a chance until 
next year 
rohatyn an advisor to the prospective democratic presidential 
candidate massachusetts gov michael dukakis went beyond voicing 
support for markeys bill which would empower the securities and 
exchange commission to regulate index futures now overseen by the 
commodity fsutures trading commission 
rohatyn suggested a series of taxes and other measures that he 
said would dampen speculation by large institutional investors 
controlling billions of dollars including pension funds insurance 
companies banks and other governmentbacked entities 
the fundamental weakness in the securities markets 
worldwide is the result of excessive speculation excessive use 
of credit and inadequate regulation rohatyn said 
rohatyn a partner at lazard freres amp co in new york said that 
market speculation is driven by large institutions which he said 
are risking the assets of retirees depositors and policy 
holders and also putting the taxpayers at risk 
rohatyn proposed 50 percent taxes on the profits from the sales 
of securities held less than one year reducing capital gains taxes 
on securities held more than five years limiting the types of 
investments governmentinsured institutions could make and other 
changes 
i am aware of the political difficulties of such a program 
he said i am resigned to the reality that it will not happen 
until the next market crisis

mr president members of the council 
i have come here today to represent the united states at the 
request of president reagan because of the importance of the 
issues at stake not just the terrible human tragedy of iran air 
655 but the continuing conflict between iran and iraq and its 
implications for international commerce in the persian gulf 
having been my countrys permanent representative to this body 
i know what a grave responsibility the council bears and the good 
it can do when it acts with realism and wisdom we are in urgent 
need of realism and wisdom now 
mr president the persian gulf is a region of vital importance 
to the united states and the economy of the world american and 
european forces are in the gulf with the support of the states of 
the area to meet a vital need to help ensure the unimpeded flow 
of oil and to keep neutral commerce moving in the face of a very 
real threat to innocent shipping this is our legal right 
iranian mines deliberately sown have disrupted innocent 
passage and damaged unarmed merchant vessals and a us naval ship 
in international waters iranian smallboat attacks on 
nonbelligerent merchant ships continue unabated these actions are 
in blatant violation of international law they give the lie to 
irans assertions that it supports freedom of navigation in the 
gulf 
we have increased the size of our forces from traditional levels 
to protect usflag shipping and to assist other neutral vessels 
under unlawful attack when they request assistance five european 
navies in addition to our own a total of some 43 ships are now 
in the gulf to counter irans reckless behavior toward neutral 
ships engaged in lawful commerce i am proud of our leadership in 
meeting this challenge 
together we have made it clear that we will keep the persian 
gulf open no matter what the threat i am here to reaffirm to 
those who depend on us and to those who would threaten us that we 
will not alter this course mr president the critical issue 
confronting this body is not the how and why of iran air 655 it is 
the continuing refusal of the government of the islamic republic of 
iran to comply with resolution 598 to negotiate an end to the war 
with iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against neutral 
shipping in the persian gulf 
the victims of iran air 655 are only the most recent casualties 
of a brutal and senseless war that has brought immense pain and 
suffering to the people of both sides 
iran long ago could have accepted and can still accept an 
honorable end to the war as a first step it should declare its 
readiness unequivocally to comply with resolution 598 today for 
the first time before this body it can act now to end the 
unspeakable sacrifices the people of both iran and iraq are being 
asked to make what possible objectives could be worth the human 
suffering and pain the hundreds of thousands of casualties and 
the economic devastation the war has caused on both sides 
a particularly horrifying aspect of the iraniraq war is the 
increasingly routine use of chemical weapons who can forget the 
pictures of entire families lying dead in the streets of their 
villages innocent of anything yet killed in this savage way 
the united states was the first nation publicly to condemn the 
use of chemical weapons in the war as a blatant violation of the 
geneva protocols we fully support security council resolution 612 
which demands an immediate end to chemical warfare by both parties 
no country should think it can use chemical weapons with impunity 
we respect irans right to air its grievances but iran cannot 
have it both ways iran cannot simultaneously complain to this body 
and defy it 
the government of the islamic republic of iran has refused to 
say plainly and clearly that it will comply with the mandatory 
decision of the security council iran must not be permitted to 
choose those provisions of resolution 598 it likes and ignore the 
others nor can iraq be permitted to rest on verbal adherence to 
resolution 598 while avoiding cooperation with the 
secretarygeneral in finding practical ways to implement the 
resolution 
as for the immediate matter at hand the unfortunate 
destruction of iran air 655 many of the circumstances remain 
unclear our own military investigation is under way we will also 
cooperate with any investigation that is conducted by the 
international civil aviation organization and we trust that the 
government of iran will do the same we want all the relevant facts 
to be brought to light as quickly as possible 
but one thing is clear the uss vincennes acted in 
selfdefense 
this tragic accident occurred against a backdrop of repeated 
unjustified unprovoked and unlawful iranian attacks against us 
merchant shipping and armed forces beginning with the mine attack 
on the uss bridgeton in july 1987 it occurred in the midst of a 
naval attack initiated by iranian vessels against a neutral vessel 
and subsequently against the vincennes when it came to the aid of 
the innocent ship in distress 
despite these hostilities iranian authorities failed to divert 
iran air 655 from the area they allowed a civilian aircraft loaded 
with passengers to proeed on a path over a warship engaged in 
battle that was irresponsible and a tragic error

<TEXT>
the information available to captain will rogers the captain of 
the vincennes indicated that an iranian military aircraft was 
approaching his ship with hostile intentions after seven 
unanswered warnings he did what he had to do to protect his ship 
and the lives of his crew as a military commander his first duty 
and responsibility is to protect his men and his ship 
the united states has never willfully acted to endanger innocent 
civilians nor will it ever but i can also assure you that the 
united states will never put its military in a dangerous situation 
and deny them the right to defend themselves 
mr president we are all accustomed by now to hearing 
irresponsible charges from the iranian government there have been 
many particularly egregious statements concerning this tragic 
incident 
i will not dignify with a response the charge that we 
deliberately destroyed iran air 655 the foreign minister of iran 
knows better he knows that this tragedy was an accident he also 
knows that by allowing a civilian airliner to fly into the area of 
an engagement between iranian warships and us forces in the gulf 
iran must bear a substantial measure of responsibility for what has 
happened 
i call on iran today to reroute civilian air traffic away from 
areas of active hostilities yesterday the us representative to 
the international civil aviation organization advocated an 
investigation by the icao into the iran air incident and immediate 
consideration of appropriate measures to ensure the safety of civil 
aviation in the gulf 
mr president the terrible disaster of iran air 655 fills our 
hearts with sorrow our reaction to this tragedy transcends 
political differences and boundaries as americans we share the 
grief of the families of the victims whatever their nationalities 
it is that strongly felt sense of common humanity that has led 
our government to decide that the united states will provide 
voluntary ex gratia compensation to the families of those who died 
in the crash of iran air 655 
we make this offer as a humanitarian gesture not as a matter 
of legal obligation but out of a sense of moral compassion 
reflecting the value we place on human life we hope that 
compensation will help ease the pain of those who have suffered a 
loss even as we recognize that nothing we can do or say can ever 
bring back their loved ones 
in the case of iranian victims we will take appropriate measure 
to ensure that the money flows directly to the families and not to 
the government we will provide none of these funds to the 
government of the islamic republic of iran indeed we will provide 
no compensation until mechanisms are in place to ensure that the 
money goes only to the families of the victims 
mr president the time has come indeed the time is long past 
for us to rededicate ourselves to the cause of peace the iran air 
tragedy should reinforce our determination to act it should remind 
those who would prefer fo ignore the terrible human cost of the 
iraniraq war and the threat it poses to the security of the 
persian gulf those who find reasons to delay rather than reasons 
to act for peace that their complacency carries a heavy price 
the united states has one overreaching goal in the persian gulf 
that goal is peace peace means cessation of the killing peace 
means total freedom of passage through the straits total freedom 
of ships to sail without risk in international waters peace also 
means nations living without the fear of threats or intimidation 
from their neighbors 
to this end we will continue to defend our interests and 
support our friends while remaining steadfastly neutral in the 
war as long as this conflict continues we and other western 
nations will work to contain the threat to freedom of navigation 
and peaceful commerce in a waterway that is vital to the economies 
of the world our naval presence is welcomed by peaceful nations 
and is a threat to no one but we will respond firmly if we are 
threatened 
the implementation of resolution 598 would enable the united 
states to return to the modest naval presence in the gulf we have 
maintained for more that 40 years with the support of the gulf 
states it would also create new opportunities for a broader 
international role perhaps under the auspices of the united 
nations to protect international commerce in the gulf we look 
forward to that day 
but make no mistake until that day we will do whatever it 
takes to maintain freedom of navigation in this vital area of the 
world and to take whatever actions we must to protect our forces 
there we will not let down our friends and allies we will not be 
intimidated by reckless attacks or terror our commitment to 
freedom and peace demands this and nothing less from the united 
states of america 
thank you very much

fourteen nurses who specialize in caring for 
aids patients were honored thursday in ceremonies at the department 
of health and human services 
i dont think the american public realizes the strain that 
aids has placed on our health care system especially in those 
cities with the highest rates of infection and the largest number 
of cases said dr robert e windom the assistant hhs secretary 
for health 
he said the strain is not just financial but on personnel 
resources 
and by personnel resources i mean nurses because it is the 
nurses who give aids patients the warm caring attention that makes 
all the difference when you are ill said windom 
when it comes to public recognition of this devotion to duty 
nurses have not had even one hand clapping he said that isnt 
right ive been a physician for 30 years and in my opinion nurses 
deserve a standing ovation from the entire nation 
windom said each of the 14 deserved to be singled out but 
emphasized that they are symbols for all of the nurses in our 
country so many of whom are equally deserving of public 
recognition for the work they are doing 
he said he hoped the awards would help serve as a candle to 
light the way for those young people who want a meaningful 
profession to consider nursing as a career 
coincidental with the awards ceremony the departments newly 
formed commission on nursing issued its first report concluding 
that while the number of registered nurses in the united states is 
at an all time high the demand outstrips the supply 
the commission has found that the situation for nurses and for 
our health care system is serious and will require the attention 
and concentrated efforts of all of us in the health care field 
said carolyne k davis a nurse who heads the commission 
the commission formed in january will make recommendations for 
action in a later report 
meanwhile it said nurses represent a bargain and hospitals 
are too often using nurses to do the work of other employees 
especially as cutbacks occur among less highly trained personnel 
the report said a majority of hospitals are relying on overtime 
work by registered nurses to staff their units adequately

billionaire john kluge is known as a 
shrewd dealmaker 
heres an example 
the 73yearold owner of metromedia inc could get 4 million by 
selling his waterfront house in westchester county but by 
dividing the lot in two he can get an additional 500000 
on tuesday night the local zoning board unanimously approved a 
variance that will allow kluge to divide the lot 
in 1972 kluge paid 350000 for an 18room house located on a 
little more than an acre he later bought property next door 
slightly less than an acre for 2 million and razed an 11room 
house so he could add on to his home 
kluge changed his mind about the addition however and decided 
to sell 
kluge could sell the entire property as one lot for about 4 
million according to an appraisal submitted to the zoning board 
but by selling two lots kluge should get at least an additional 
500000 the appraisal said 
kluge who is worth 3 billion is the secondrichest american 
trailing sam walton head of the walmart retailing chain

jesse jackson said today he had received an 
apology from a top aide to michael dukakis but is asking former 
president carter to step in and help ease continuing tension 
between their two camps 
jackson said carter could play a real role in facilitating a 
meeting between the appropriate parties he has gained the respect 
of all of us 
despite sending conciliatory signals to the dukakis camp 
jackson said we will exercise all of our rights and he added 
we are prepared to deliberate and debate tuesday wednesday and 
thursday during next weeks democratic national convention 
at a news conference before heading to atlanta jackson said he 
did not want a personal apology but rather a role for his 
supporters 
presently i do not know the proposed strategy to win at this 
point my constituency has no place on the team he said 
mr bentsen symbolizes one wing of our party he said i 
represent the other wing of the party on a number of issues our 
views are opposite thats all right there is room for both it 
takes two wings to fly and so far our wing is not connected 
in what a jackson aide called a good start to mending 
relations between the two men dukakis telephoned jackson on 
wednesday to try to ease misunderstandings over the way jackson 
learned about the selection of sen lloyd bentsen of texas as 
dukakis running mate 
earlier thursday top dukakis aide paul brountas called jackson 
on the same subject 
on wednesday jackson may have fueled the passions of those who 
want to run him against bentsen by saying the floor was wide 
open on the vice presidential vote next thursday night 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk said today in 
atlanta that dukakis had talked to jackson by telephone within 
the last 24 hours in an effort to rebuild frayed relations 
i know there has been a conversation between the two 
candidates and several conversations between the two campaigns 
kirk said i think well be moving forward to make sure there are 
continuing discussions and hopefully well be able to resolve any 
differences on substantive matters 
jackson convention manager ron brown also in atlanta said 
dukakis and jackson agreed in their conversation to keep in touch 
between now and sunday when both men are in atlanta 
it was an important call and a good start brown said 
asked if the call mollified jackson about the perceived slight 
over the fact that he learned of bentsens selections from 
reporters not dukakis brown said i guess his reaction is the 
same as mine 
it just seems to us that the most important thing the dukakis 
campaign had to do during this process was consult with jesse 
jackson and keep him informed they failed to do either brown 
said that is a very significant oversight 
jacksons departure by bus caravan to the convention city comes 
as many of his supporters are still reeling from what they 
considered dukakis snub 
dukakis says he tried to call jackson on tuesday morning to tell 
him lloyd bentsen had been picked but was not able to reach him 
he spoke with jackson before the actual announcement but after 
reports were already circulating of the texas senators selection 
and two democratic sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said jackson was told privately monday afternoon that he would not 
be picked one source said dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas 
told jackson he would bring the ticket down if nominated for 
vice president 
a clearly irked jackson complained in a news conference that 
dukakis is excluding him from the unity team jackson has repeatedly 
emphasized as the key to victory in november 
at this point im not in the partnership he said adding 
im not suggesting that i will compete for a place on the ticket 
but the floor is wide open on thursday night when the 
recommendation is made 
im being asked to in spite of inadequate communication and 
not being recommended for the ticket to motivate more people and 
deliver more votes and pour out more energy at greater risk and 
danger than any governor or any senator 
he would expect in return he said satisfaction for the 
legitimate and reasonable requests of his constituents 
on wednesday night speaking to operation push the civil rights 
group he founded jackson sounded similar themes complaining about 
exclusion 
for too long the power brokers have sat in small rooms with 
closed doors and made great decisions he declared we must be 
a part of this process when they sit around these tables the key 
investors in our party are not in the group 
jackson officials had been negotiating privately on unresolved 
platform issues but those talks were halted in light of the 
running mate matter brown said 
its up to dukakis to make it a unity convention brown 
said adding that jackson has the logistical wherewithal to make 
our presence felt on any matter at the convention 
jackson told his news conference that many people have a sense 
of indignation and a sense of insult about the handling of 
bentsens selection 
after dukakis and bentsen met with the congressional black 
caucus wednesday some of his capitol hill supporters said they 
were satisfied the communication foulup tuesday was inadvertent 
lots of fences have been mended said rep mervyn dymally 
dcalif chairman of the caucus we have a very fruitful 
discussion about the convention the campaign and the presidency

jesse jackson today asked jimmy carter to mediate 
his dispute with democratic nomineetobe michael dukakis 
republican george bush added his opinion that dukakis could have 
shown a little more in terms of sensitivity toward jackson in 
the way he announced his running mate 
jackson said former president carter understands the 
equation as the democrats try to patch up relations between the 
dukakis and jackson camps in the final days before the democratic 
national convention 
i simply want the respect and responsibility jackson said 
at a chicago news conference before starting a threeday bus trip 
ending at the convention here 
bush made his comment on dukakis and sensitivity as he traveled 
to the united nations security council where he strongly defended 
the united states actions in the persian gulf 
relations between jackson and dukakis have been chilly since 
dukakis choose texas sen lloyd bentsen as his running mate on 
tuesday 
the massachusetts governor tried to warm up the situation with a 
telephone call to jackson on wednesday 
it was an important call and a good start jackson 
convention manager ron brown said today he said dukakis tried to 
explain the failure in communicating dukakis vice presidential 
choice to jackson before word got out on tuesday 
jackson said he called carter this morning to ask him to help 
out 
he has earned respect of all of us jackson said he 
understands the equation 
jackson warned he still may challenge dukakis every night of the 
convention 
it is an open convention we have not yet made a decision 
about all the strategies we will employ jackson said we will 
exercise all of our rights 
he said it is an open question as to whether hell allow his 
name to be entered in nomination for vice president 
democratic national committee chairman paul kirk and house 
speaker jim wright who will chair the convention were both 
hopeful that the differences between the campaigns could be 
resolved 
i think well be moving forward to make sure there are 
continuing discussions and hopefully well be able to resolve any 
differences on substantive matters kirk said in atlanta 
in washington wright said jackson had earned and fully 
deserves a place in the highest councils and he will have it 
kirk acknowledged that negotiations on the platform are still 
stalled and he said he had personally talked to jackson to explain 
his role in the tuesday announcement of texas sen lloyd bentsen as 
dukakiss running mate 
dukakis and bentsen spent wednesday mending fences with major 
jackson supporters with some success 
its a strong ticket its a winning ticket said rep john 
lewis of georgia after dukakis and bentsen met with the 
congressional black caucus on capitol hill it was very friendly 
in the room 
bush who is moving to start the process of selecting his own 
running mate talked to a breakfast gathering in baltimore today 
before heading to the united nations 
in baltimore bush was asked how he would have handled jackson 
if he had been dukakis 
maybe he dukakis could have done a little more in terms of 
sensitivity he told the gathering of black businessmen 
the republican vice president said he and jackson have a 
pleasant relationship i give him great credit for mobilizing 
our attention on the need to address the narcotics question 
then bush flew to new york where he was to speak for the reagan 
administration at the un security council defending the 
governments actions in the shooting down of an iranian airliner by 
a us warship in the persian gulf 
bush in his prepared speech blamed the iranian government for 
allowing the airliner to fly over the gulf as its gunboats and the 
uss vincennes were fighting calling such a decision 
irresponsible 
one thing is clear he said the uss vincennes acted in 
selfdefense in firing two missiles at the jetliner which us 
officials say was mistaken for an iranian f14 fighter closing in 
on the cruiser 
two new national polls gave sharply conflicting views of where 
the race for the white house stands before the democratic 
convention opens and before the selection of bentsen was 
announced 
the los angeles times survey gave dukakis an 11point lead 49 
percent to 38 percent over bush in 1763 telephone interviews with 
registered voters conducted july 510 several other national polls 
have given dukakis a lead of about 10 points 
but a usa todaycnn poll put the two contenders in a virtual 
tie that survey of 1264 registered voters july 610 gave bush 47 
percent to dukakiss 44 percent both surveys have sampling error 
margins of about three percentage points meaning the usa todaycnn 
results are a tie 
dukakis the governor of massachusetts was spending the day at 
the statehouse in boston facing a state budget crisis 
jackson beginning a threeday bus trip to atlanta today was 
still frosty toward dukakis the civil rights leader has been 
fuming over dukakis failure to tell him of his choice of bentsen 
tuesday before he learned of it from reporters 
after yesterday many people have a sense of indignation and a 
sense of insult jackson said at a chicago news conference 
wednesday 
at a capitol hill news conference dukakis said he had 
apologized to jackson when he did reach him tuesday morning 
i said i was sorry that i missed him on the first call 
dukakis said

president reagan on thursday visited the 
radio station where he began his career as a broadcaster a 
halfcentury ago saying broadcasting is a good way of making a 
living and a good way of serving others 
reagan stopped at station woc after visiting droughtstricken 
farm areas in southern illinois 
reagan was invited to the station where he went to work in 
1932 to dedicate a new building that opened several months ago 
a lot has changed since 1932 but in a funny way the business 
stays the same said the president who still delivers a weekly 
radio broadcast 
its a good way of making a living and a good way of serving 
others he said 
the new station is three miles from the building where reagan 
started work broadcasting football games 
the original studio was on the top floor of the palmer school of 
chiropractic which is now the administration building of the 
palmer college of chiropractic 
donna kendall director of public relations for the college 
said its name was changed several years ago and the school and the 
radio station were severed from each other sometime around 1940 
woc was an abbreviation for world of chiropractic 
reagan first showed up at woc in the late summer of 1932 
borrowing his fathers oldsmobile to make the trip of approximately 
75 miles from the family home in dixon ill 
it was his first stop on a round of smalltown radio stations he 
planned to visit in search of a job 
although the station did not have an opening reagan talked the 
station manager into giving him a tryout 
the manager offered him a chance to broadcast a university of 
iowa football game the next saturday for 5 and his roundtrip fare 
from dixon 
he was then hired to broadcast the games throughout the football 
season at 10 a game 
after a regular staff vacancy occurred he went to work for the 
station at 100 a month on feb 10 1933 according to historian 
garry wills in his book reagans america reagan had left by 
the end of may to work for wocs sister station who in des moines 
he stayed in des moines radio until 1937 when it was off to 
hollywood and the movie career that paved the way for his entry 
into politics and his election as governor of california

weather experts discussed the drought 
thursday and its possible causes and effects and said they hoped 
to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last 
all of the speakers at the 1988 drought symposium called for 
more research and study 
theres an enormous number of possibilities that one could 
chase the next business of the scientist is to eliminate the 
possibilities of and extend the range of analysis and look for 
cause and effect said david rodenhuis director of the federal 
climate analysis center in washington 
the symposium attended by 13 state and national experts was 
sponsored by the weather channel an atlantabased cable network 
which broadcast the meeting live 
john hope the networks hurricane specialist and a former 
forecaster with the national hurricane center in miami fla said 
the drought in the southeast might be lessened or ended in the next 
few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season 
hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical 
storms more of which should become hurricanes in this hurricane 
season 
he stressed that a hurricanes effect on drought is variable 
depending on the intensity and speed of the storm nevertheless he 
said some southeastern states get as much as 25 pecent of their 
rainfall in some months from hurricanes 
georgia state climatologist gayther plummer told the symposium 
he thought the position of the planet jupiter had something to do 
with drought in the southeast 
however rodenhuis said he was skeptical about plummers thesis 
its very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the 
issue he said

the house voted 38518 on thursday to condemn 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government for brutal suppression 
of basic human rights and urged the democracies of central 
america to meet to assess the situation 
unlike a similar resolution adopted by the senate in a 914 roll 
call wednesday night the measure drafted by the houses democratic 
leadership did not pose the possibility that military aid to the 
contra rebels might eventually be resumed 
the house version condemned the sandinistas for arresting more 
than 40 people including opposition leaders and for closing down 
the opposition newspaper laprensa for 15 days and a roman catholic 
radio station indefinitely 
it also urged central american leaders to convene immediately 
to assess the conditions in nicaragua described in this 
resolution 
i expect this body to take stronger action later said rep 
robert j lagamarsino rcalif this resolution contains strong 
words but it is just that strong words there are no teeth in 
this resolution 
rep david bonior dmich said the resolution is necessary 
because it is important that we in this country condemn any 
violations of the principle of democracy 
bonior said he believes there is still life in the peace process 
fostered by president oscar arias of costa rica the basis for 
progress i believe still remains he said 
earlier thursday us ambassador robert melton expelled from 
managua this week by the sandinistas told the senate intelligence 
committee he believes congressional resolutions do little to sway 
the sandinistas 
melton said he does think the sandinistas are impressed with 
any evidence of resoluteness on the part of the congress and 
evidence of bipartisan resolve but he added i think the 
sandinistas are impressed more by actions than by words 
melton said embassy functions have been so crippled by that 
countrys leftist sandinista government that there are only very 
marginal reasons to maintain diplomatic relations 
the united states has made no move to end relations and 
administration officials say they plan to replace embassy aides 
ousted with melton as soon as possible 
one of the nearterm tests is when we send new people there 
melton said he said the manner in which they are treated and 
permitted to operate will be a very real test of their the 
sandinistas desire to maintain relations 
the ambassador was asked by sen arlen specter rpa if there 
is any purpose for the united states to maintain a diplomatic 
presence in nicaragua which gives legitimacy to the 
government if the embassy cannot function 
very marginal very marginal purposes melton replied 
he said that in his three months in managua he was falsely 
accused of masterminding plan melton a conspiracy allegedly 
aimed at subverting the sandinista government 
but melton said there is not one scintilla of evidence that 
he or the seven other us diplomats expelled with him on monday 
ever engaged in espionage or any other activity that could have 
justified action against them 
the sandinistas protested the contents of a speech melton 
delivered at the us embassy in celebration of independence day 
but he said the quotes to which they objected were not his but 
those of abraham lincoln 
melton testified that embassy officials were followed by 
sandinista agents armed with cameras and that their photographs 
falsely identifying them as cia agents were printed in local 
newspapers 
at the state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley reacted 
sharply to a claim by the director general of the nicaraguan 
foreign ministry alejandro bendana that us diplomats had 
taunted nicaraguan police at a rally last sunday in nandaime 
bendana sought to prove his case by showing a photograph on us 
news broadcasts of the diplomats with their hands raised 
mrs oakley called the use of photographs wellknown 
propagandistic devices because the message they convey can be 
easily manipulated she said the photograph shown by bendana was 
taken at a time when the embassy personnel were signaling other 
members of their group to prepare to depart 
melton denied that embassy officials participated in the 
opposition rally or were present in any other capacity than that of 
observers 
one committee member sen howard w metzenbaum dohio said he 
was skeptical that the sandinistas expelled the us diplomats with 
no rational motive 
i kid you not when i say there is something bothering me in 
the back of my mind metzenbaum said why did president daniel 
ortega in what seems to fly in the face of logic and reason 
take the steps that he did at the time that he did i have the 
feeling that i dont know everything 
melton replied if these actions seem irrational it is 
because they are 
melton said that since arriving in managua in april most of his 
requests for meetings with sandinista officials were ignored and 
the government attempted to discourage his contacts with opposition 
figures something he defended as normal us diplomatic practice 
he called the expulsion order an attempt to intimidate the 
opposition thats the way i think it should be recognized 
the message to the opposition is youre alone and youre 
in our hands he said

had written and she resigned her position court records show 
further auditing disclosed she had written 15 additional checks 
using fraudulent documentation for a total of 10300 
the checks were deposited in a bank account at marine national

the senate judiciary committee today voted 
along party lines to kill the appeals court nomination of bernard 
siegan a conservative california law professor whose writings are 
often at odds with supreme court precedent 
the committee voted 86 for a democratic motion recommending 
senate rejection of siegan and minority republicans said their 
fight for the university of san diego professor was over 
president reagan nominated siegan for the 9th us circuit court 
of appeals which covers nine western states 
after the party line vote on sen edward kennedys motion for a 
negative recommendation republicans failed in a move to have the 
nomination reported to the senate without recommendation the vote 
was 77 with sen dennis deconcini dariz voting with the gop 
kennedy dmass criticized siegans lack of experience before 
federal courts he had one case three decades ago and said the 
nominee practiced judicial activism in the extreme 
sen strom thurmond rsc defended siegan saying his 
judicial philosophy should not be the single criteria for 
judging him he added nothing about his character experience or 
background should stop him from serving on the court 
siegan wrote that the 1954 supreme court decision outlawing 
school segregation was correct but decided by faulty reasoning 
the landmark ruling siegan said should have been based on the 
right of black students to travel to the schools of their choice 
his critics said this would have left students at the schoolhouse 
door without guaranteeing a seat inside 
siegan said prayer in schools could be constitutional although 
the supreme court has said otherwise he wrote that equal weight 
should be given to property rights and human rights and he said 
framers of the 14th amendment which guarantees basic freedoms 
never intended its scope to be as broad as that defined by the 
supreme court 
siegan 63 tried to save his troubled nomination at a hearing 
last february when he told the committee he would follow supreme 
court precedent and not his own feelings if approved by the 
senate 
if a case comes where i cant observe the law of the land i 
would resign siegan said then there are times i will rule 
contrary to my own feelings 
the 9th circuit has jurisdiction over alaska arizona 
california hawaii idaho montana nevada oregon washington 
guam and the northern mariana islands

the hard hats came off the lights and music came 
on and the rostrum rose seemingly on its own thursday signaling 
that the home of the 1988 democratic national convention is ready 
well nearly ready 
atlantas omni coliseum bedecked in a television designers 
vision of patriotic colors pink gray and pale blue was 
declared complete in a brief ribboncutting ceremony 
then it was back to work because this enormous complex of 
podiums risers camera platforms and network studios inside what 
is otherwise home for the atlanta hawks basketball team wont be 
fully ready until the gavel falls monday 
dont take for granted it was just another days work 
democratic national chairman paul kirk told construction workers 
who gathered in the seats where delegates will sit next week it 
was a page in history 
the hall where michael dukakis will claim his partys 
presidential nomination has been the scene of hurried preparations 
for weeks and as the advance wave of journalists and party 
officials arrived over the last several days they could hardly 
hear each other over the din of construction 
kirk and atlanta mayor andrew young showed off the fancy 
moveable podium sections after the ribbon was cut they are 
controlled with hydraulic lifts by a stage manager who will sit 
behind the speakers and who has the power with a flip of a 
control to make 5foot 8inch dukakis look as tall as 6foot 2inch 
jackson at least on television 
the entire hall is amazingly small so small that half the 
4212 delegates wont actually sit on the floor theyll be in the 
bleachers 
what it looks like actually is a television set and thats 
basically what it is 
i approached it from that standpoint said rene lagler a 
california television set designer who planned the convention 
interior 
lagler also came up with the color scheme which he prefers to 
call red white and blue 
on camera the whole thing will look red white and blue he 
said just squint thats what it will look like on television 
some squinters however found the colors remained pink gray 
and pale blue 
overhead lights swiveled by remote control as they will when 
the convention begins and canned music poured from giant speakers 
that were sniffed by bombdetecting dogs before they were lifted 
overhead for delegates in seats so poor they cant see giant 
television screens atop the whole thing will provide a view 
mike mccurry the conventions director of communications said 
that while all looks pretty close to ready there are constant 
demands for adjustments 
i walked in here yesterday and thought my lord theyre not 
going to be ready mccurry said but theyve done a lot in two 
days 
even as the ribbon was cut however television microwave 
receivers were still being installed above studio skyboxes that 
allow anchormen to look down on the whole thing 
cnns team of correspondents producers and crews had been 
standing around for hours their scheduled dress rehearsal of floor 
coverage left dead in the water by a failed radio system 
the big dispute of the week was over where the four television 
networks talent the bigname correspondents were going to 
sit after a howl of protest that they were being placed too far up 
behind the podium mccurry accommodated them with a closer spot 
the full podium is 200 feet wide though what moves is only a 
smaller rostrum and surrounding area the huge structure further 
reduces in size what is already a small hall seating no more than 
12000 to 17000 people for sports events 
just off the floor is the hawks office where general manager 
stan kasten strolled out to declare the hall unrecognizable 
its amazing he said 
most of the 13500 or so journalists wont even get in the hall 
or will only part of the time theyre being accommodated in the 
vast georgia world congress center dubbed the media village 
theres plenty of room but its another world from the hall and 
to get there is a walk out doors and across the street 
outside the whole thing scores of satellite uplink trucks were 
being put in place their dish antennas pointed skyward theres a 
mobilehome village of network equipment and the handful of 
trailers the dukakis and jackson campaigns each will use as command 
posts 
back inside lagler was looking over his labors when one of his 
hardhatted workers came up with a question when was the meeting 
to discuss tearing it all down after thursday night 
thatll be another problem lagler said getting all this 
out of here

a federal judge apologized thursday to an 
attorney he had scolded and threatened with jail when she insisted 
on using her maiden name and the courtesy title ms in court 
i have always referred to married women by their married name 
this is the way my generation was taught said senior us 
district judge hubert teitelbaum 73 
i recognize your right to be addressed in any manner in which 
you see fit and i apologize for my comments and the resulting 
situation the judge told barbara wolvovitz and three other 
attorneys involved in the trial of a race discrimination suit 
against ppg industries inc 
on july 8 teitelbaum told ms wolvovitz whose husband is 
university of pittsburgh law professor jules lobel from here on 
in this courtroom you will use mrs lobel thats your name 
the judge originally threatened her with jail when she resisted 
his instruction and when her cocounsel jon pushinsky protested 
teitelbaum found him in contempt for officious intermeddling 
and gave him a suspended 30day jail sentence 
ms wolvovitz representing two black men suing ppg moved 
monday for a mistrial which teitelbaum rejected when she again 
stated her preference he said what if i call you sweetie the 
judge said he would settle for calling her counselor he also 
vacated his contempt order for pushinsky 
the jury began deliberations wednesday afternoon and was still 
out when the judge made his apology which was officially entered 
into court records 
teitelbaum said that if ms wolvovitz still wanted to press for 
a mistrial he would grant it before the jury returned with a 
verdict 
teitelbaum said the parties would be stuck with that verdict 
if they declined his offer 
the attorneys agreed to not seek a mistrial hours later the 
jury decided against ms wolvovitzs clients who had charged they 
were harassed at work because of their race 
ms wolvovitz 36 who has practiced law for 10 years and 
pushinsky did not want to comment further after the judges 
apology pushinsky said thursday 
i think that he did what he had to do and thank god he did 
it said national organization for women president molly yard a 
pittsburgh resident who is familiar with teitelbaum i think its 
raised everybodys consciousness and thats fine 
tom hollander president of the allegheny county bar 
association said i think it was big of him to apologize 
joann dempler teitelbaums law clerk for eight years said the 
judge is not sexist does not discriminate against woman 
does not demean women 
hes a tease she said thursday his sense of humor is 
such that he likes to tease and joke and kid around and if people 
do not know that they could easily misconstrue what hes doing or 
saying 
even in court because were dealing with very serious 
matters every once in a while to just sort of inject a little 
levity or reduce tension he will make a lighthearted remark and 
people who know him realize he doesnt mean to offend anyone 
mrs dempler said 
teitelbaum said he wasnt teasing when he told ms wolvovitz she 
would sleep in the county jail tonight if she refused to be 
addressed as mrs lobel 
i unfortunately lost my temper and the matter then got out of 
hand he said 
the judge also said he misstated pennsylvania law when he told 
ms wolvovitz she was legally required to use her husbands last 
name unless she had court permission to do otherwise 
i was wrong teitelbaum said i made a mistake

black members of congress predicted thursday 
that there will be boisterous protests at next weeks democratic 
convention in atlanta over what they see as gov michael dukakis 
snub of jesse jackson 
but some of the lawmakers also said they understand political 
realities and will hold a black strategy session early in the week 
in an effort to repair the schism between the dukakis and jackson 
camps and end the quadrennial meeting as a unified party 
clearly the way jesse jackson was dealt with on a personal 
basis looms as a monumental issue said rep ron dellums 
dcalif it speaks to how black people are perceived in this 
election he is the personification of the hopes of millions of 
people whether mr dukakis understands that or not is something 
that remains to be seen 
jackson and his supporters were stung by dukakis selection of 
texas sen lloyd bentsen for the vice presidential spot on the 
democratic ticket and the hurt was compounded when jackson first 
learned about the choice from reporters rather than directly from 
dukakis 
dukakis telephoned jackson on wednesday to try to mend strained 
relations and jackson said thursday he had asked former president 
jimmy carter to mediate between the two camps jackson also said he 
got an apology from a top dukakis aide but no apology from dukakis 
the lawmakers said their concerns extended beyond the personal 
tiff to the appearance that issues of concern to blacks were being 
given short shrift 
rep mervyn dymally dcalif chairman of the congressional 
black caucus said meetings aimed at healing the rift are being set 
up for his group with paul brountas the top dukakis aide who ran 
the campaigns vicepresidential search and possibly later with 
dukakis himself 
we are trying to salvage this dymally said acknowledging 
that there is a wide range of intensity about the matter among the 
23 black house members who make up the caucus we are practical 
politicians 
some caucus members said they recognized the danger to their 
political standing if jackson appears to be going to the convention 
purely as a spoiler 
the black caucus was working through rep nicholas mavroules 
dmass to set up the meetings and mavroules said he expected 
there to be a lengthy meeting perhaps on tuesday 
i think it would be a very wise idea on the part of the 
dukakis people mavroules said they can talk at length about 
problems about issues and if they want they can talk about the 
jackson thing i would like very much if we could have a nice 
good normal united convention 
mavroules said the members of the congressional black caucus 
play a very key role we need them with us i think most of them 
want this settled 
some of those lawmakers however appeared to be turning up the 
heat on dukakis rep gus savage dill vowed to stage a march on 
monday from the grave of slain civil rights leader dr martin 
luther king jr to the omni convention center 
savage said another protest rally will be held on wednesday near 
the convention center just before the presidential nomination is 
made and said blacks would boycott the acceptance speeches on 
thursday of dukakis and bentsen if jackson is not on the ticket 
dellums said dukakis is showing a level of arrogance that is 
extraordinary in not making an open and uncompromising apology to 
jackson he and others said it is up to dukakis to extend a hand to 
jackson and make a public show of concern for jackson and the 
issues he represents 
i think theres going to be a lot of confusion down in 
atlanta a lot of pain down there dellums said

the army information systems command said 
thursday that a criminal investigation of unisys corp in arizona 
involves alleged overcharging on a 92 million contract 
the contract for computer support work between unisys and the 
systems command expired in september 1987 and relates to the way in 
which costs were allocated by sperry corp army spokesman al 
hinton said in a statement from fort huachuca ariz where the 
army command is based 
sperry corp was merged with burroughs corp to form unisys 
corp in 1986 
unisys has an estimated 80 million in computer hardware and 
software support contracts with the army information systems 
command the fort huachuca investigation is separate from the 
sweeping pentagon bribery probe in which unisys is also involved 
the command provides the army worldwide with automated data 
processing including office automation communications printing 
and publishing records management and visual information 
the existence of the probe under way for several months and 
being conducted by the us attorneys office in tucson was 
confirmed wednesday by unisys from its headquarters in blue bell 
pa but no details were provided 
the company said it has been cooperating with the office of 
the us attorney in tucson ariz in its investigation of a 
contract with the army communications center based in fort 
huachuca 
sperry and unisys have provided software support to the command 
for more than 10 years 
the wall street journal which on wednesday disclosed the 
existence of the fort huachuca probe quoted a source familiar with 
the investigation as saying that the government contended it may 
have been overcharged by as much as 10 million but the army 
command statement said that any overcharges would be considerably 
less in view of the total size of the contract of 92 million

jesse jackson weighing his strategy options for 
the democratic convention next week has put together a 
sophisticated logistical operation that can handle just about any 
decision he makes his convention manager says 
when jacksons bus caravan arrives in town this weekend amid 
great hoopla awaiting will be the technical backbone of his 
convention operation born of weeks of planning and gritty detail 
the setup with systems to communicate instantly with floor 
delegates was put in place at a time when it was not known how much 
it would actually be used said jacksons convention manager ron 
brown 
in light of developments this week when jackson suspended 
continuing platform talks with the dukakis campaign decisions are 
up in the air as to what he will do at the convention the 
operation could end up being more important than originally 
envisioned 
you can assume we have the wherewithal to make our presence 
felt on everything that happens at the convention said brown 
democratic national committee press secretary mike mccurry the 
partys convention spokesman says jackson did what the 
democratic party itself should have done went out and hired some 
of the most experienced and best convention organizers 
the party staff even sought out jackson team members for advice 
on how to handle an occasional problem of their own mccurry said 
although gov michael dukakis is the conventions inevitable 
convention nominee mccurry said jackson has a very well 
organized operation that would rival gov dukakis 
it goes without saying that gov dukakis has more resources 
and something of an edge as a front runner mccurry said but 
added i would put both teams on the field and know that you 
would have a very even game 
as recently as monday jacksons headquarters trailers outside 
the convention hall had working phones electricity furniture and 
staff moving in dukakis trailers nearby were empty with about 
two dozen filled watercooler bottles lined up underneath one 
the dukakis people are peeking in the windows of our 
trailer brown joked early in the week 
jackson intends to use the machinery in the traditional manner 
with a whip system to communicate from telephones in 
headquarters trailers to delegates on the convention floor 
we ran a very serious presidential campaign and were running 
a very sophisticated convention operation brown said 
were serious players on the american political scene now and 
in the future and i think we have to demonstrate that you have to 
demonstrate competence sense of purpose discipline 
this years operation is miles ahead of jacksons 1984 set up in 
san francisco when he made his first presidential bid 
that year jacksonspent a fraction of the estimated 500000 he 
is putting into his staff of about 50 and preparations for this 
years convention

president reagan seeing for himself the 
devastation brought to farmers by this summers drought today told 
those hard hit by the dry spell we cant make it rain but we 
can help to ease the pain 
reagan spoke to an audience of 200 or so gathered under a shade 
tree at the fairgrounds here to his back was a field of corn 
green from recent rains but still shriveled by the lack of moistute 
minutes earlier reagan had walked through corn and soybean 
fields on herman and richard krones 2800acre farm reagan 
towered over the corn normally 8 feet high by now but today less 
than half that height soybeans plants were a quarter of their 
expected size 
what i saw was not a pretty sight reagan told his audience 
earlier reagan had spent 25 minutes in the presidential 
helicopter inspecting fields from the air 
he noted the rains that had come to southern illinois in recent 
days the rain up to 4 inches in places may have helped but 
it hasnt solved the problem he said 
the white house has said that reagan would sign relief 
legislation making its way through congress provided that 
rostraising amendments are not tacked on 
asked about the amendments more than 30 in each house and 
covering a variety of special interests reagan said i hope 
that theyre not being tacked on i hope they are not getting away 
with it 
later reagan said in a luncheon speech in davenport iowa that 
we should keep our eye on the ball drought relief should be just 
that drought relief congress should not use it as an excuse to 
rewrite farm legislation he said 
partisanship should be kept out of the issue of drought 
relief the president said politics must stop at the parched 
fields edge 
the white house said reagan feels two forms of legislative help 
are essential for farmers had hit through much of the nation 
aid for farmers who have received advance deficiency payments 
which are advances on what a farmer expects to receive from the 
government after harvest 
as of now many droughtstricken farms will have to refund 
this money the announcement from the white house press office 
said 
help for suffering farmers not covered by the 
advancedeficiency payment system 
the white house also noted that the president has been working 
closely with the leadership of the house and senate agriculture 
committees and with governors from farm states to draft timely 
bipartisan legislation to help the many farmers who will suffer 
substantial losses 
although krones farm has had nearly 2 inches of rain this week 
and some parts of southern illinois have had up to 4 inches of rain 
recently agriculture experts say the rain wont do much to help 
the already shriveled corn crop 
even though it has rained when the president looks at the 
crops hes going to see a bad situation said steve newman of 
the illinois farm bureau 
at the 2800acre krone farm about 400 acres of the 1200acre 
corn crop are believed to have been irreversibly damaged for a 
financial loss estimated at 35000 krone said corn stalks that 
should be 10 feet to 12 feet high by this time of year measure only 
2 feet to 5 feet with burnt brownish tassels 
the dry spell also has parched 125 acres of pasture used to feed 
krones 150 head of cattle so that for the past month he has had 
to feed them alfalfa hay 
krone a reagan admirer who doesnt receive any federal 
subsidies said im not looking for a handout i can survive if 
theres no rain and it the drought continues 
from southern illinois reagan flew to davenport iowa where he 
took part in the dedication of a new building at radio station woc 
where he broke into radio in 1932 
a lot has changed since 1932 but in a funny way the business 
stays the same said the president who still delivers a weekly 
radio broadcast its a good way of making a living and a good 
way of serving others he said 
on wednesday reagan said he will do all he can to protect 
farmers from excessive losses but he wont approve droughtrelief 
measures that would bust the budget 
congress is considering a bill to provide payments of up to 
100000 apiece to farmers whose crops are destroyed or severely 
damaged 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng said that because of the 
severity of the drought the administration would overlook minor 
flaws in the bill white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the 
president generally supports this legislation 
the spokesman said the bill would cost about 55 billion 
the bill would be financed with money that would have been 
paid as subsidies to farmers in ordinary weather conditions he 
said because of higher cash prices congressional aides 
calculate the government farm programs could be as much as 8 
billion less than originally estimated 
reagan meeting with farm leaders said that droughtrelief 
legislation has to be considered in the context of our efforts to 
reduce the federal deficit to put it very simply we mustnt bust 
the budget 
he said that the automatic budget sequestration cuts that 
overspending triggers would take back from farmers with one hand 
what were providing in drought relief with the other 
there have been indications that the white house office of 
management and budget may be scrutinizing the surplus of federal 
dollars available under the crop acreage support program as a means 
of helping the government avoid mandatory budget cuts in midaugust 
under the grammrudman deficitreduction act

iran failed thursday to get a clear condemnation 
of the united states for the july 3 attack on an iranian jetliner 
but a special session of the international civil aviation 
organization said it deplored the use of weapons against a civil 
aircraft 
the united nations agencys 33member governing council 
unanimously agreed to an independent icao investigation into the 
disaster with results to be reported at the next icao session 
sept 1516 
we are delighted by the results us assistant secretary of 
state richard s williamson said at the end of twoday meeting 
temptations and efforts to politicize this session were 
rebuffed 
iranian spokesman seirous naseri said his country had hoped for 
a strong condemnation of the united states and warned that the july 
3 tragedy could recur unless us forces withdraw from the persian 
gulf 
naseri blamed political constraints for the councils mild 
response citing american influence and power 
it is not easy for all countries to come out and speak very 
frankly and openly against the united states even when the united 
states commits a very serious crime 
he said iran would look to the un security council for 
political condemnation of the us action 
williamson rankled when asked at a news conference if he had 
engaged in armtwisting thats a ridiculous and insulting 
assertion by the iranians he said naseri told the council that 
on july 5 two days after the us warship vincennes shot down iran 
air flight 655 killing all 290 people on board a domestic iranian 
flight was warned by us forces in the gulf 
fortunately this time the warning was received by the pilot 
and he was able to respond naseri said this could have ended 
in a similar tragedy 
the iranians maintain that iran air 655 never received the seven 
military and civilian channel radio warnings the vincennes claims 
it sent before firing 
naseri said he was not aware of why the pilot of the later 
flight iran air 235 from bandar langah to bandar abbas heard the 
us warning when the doomed earlier flight apparently did not 
williamson said he was not aware of the second incident 
the icao decision was in the form of a ninepart statement from 
council president dr assad kotaite 
the soviet union czechoslovakia cuba china and kenya wanted 
to back iran more strongly by calling the statement a 
resolution but they were outvoted 
the decision read very similarly to icaos response in 1983 
after the soviet union shot down a korean air lines jet and that 
was called a resolution following an investigation icao did 
condemn that soviet action 
in thursdays decision members asked the icao secretary general 
to launch an immediate factfinding investigation to determine 
all the relevant facts and technical aspects of the chain of 
events relevant to the flight and destruction of the aircraft 
all relevant parties were urged to cooperate fully with the 
probe iran and the united states said during the session that they 
would 
the council deplored the use of weapons against a civil 
aircraft the decision said it expressed profound regret at 
the loss of lives and deep sympathy with the victims families 
the council reaffirmed the principle that states must refrain 
from resorting to the use of violence against civil aircraft 
appealed to more nations to ratify a 1984 icao protocol to that 
effect and asked countries to refrain from jeopardizing the safety 
of civil aviation in troubled areas 
the decision also called on the icao to renew efforts to 
coordinate civilian and military air traffic improve routing in 
troubled areas and review standards and practises 
naseri said rerouting iranian flights could lead to chaos it 
would be the decisions of military commanders somewhere in the 
world to place their ships wherever they want and then decide 
routes would be adjusted accordingly said naseri irans un 
representative in geneva

george bushs speech to the un security 
council voicing compassion for victims of a usdowned iranian 
airliner while insisting that iran share responsiblity gave the 
vice president a forum for displaying traits he has hoped to 
project in his white house campaign 
the highprofile address on thursday in which bush looked 
straight at his iranian accuser and told him of course we care 
was viewed by aides as a demonstration of his leadership 
compassion and foreignpolicy credentials 
bushs expressions of regret went further than his past reaction 
to the downing of the plane which he previously had called just 
an unhappy incident while telling audiences life goes on 
anytime you can go and speak forcefully about bringing peace 
to this part of the world its worth doing said bush chief of 
staff craig fuller afterwards he didnt do it for political 
reasons but i do not believe it will be harmful politically 
bush who was us ambassador to the united nations from 1971 to 
1973 denounced as offensive and absurd iranian suggestions 
that the downing of iran air 635 containing 290 people on july 3 
was intentional or reckless 
and he told the world organization iran must bear a 
substantial measure of responsiblity for what has happened by 
refusing to divert the airliner away from a combat zone 
there are three ways for iran to avoid future tragedies 
bush said keep airliners away from combat stop attacking 
innocent ships or better still the best way is peace 
he called for iran to immediately adhere to a un resolution 
calling for a ceasefire in the region 
at the same time the vice president said this nations reaction 
to the accidental downing of the plane fills our hearts with 
sorrow that transcends political differences and boundaries 
aides said that bushs presentation was written by three or four 
speechwriters with most of the ideas for its wording coming from 
him the text was coordinated with both the state department and 
the national security council before bush delivered it the aides 
said 
departing from his prepared text bush looked across the 
semicircular council table at iranian foreign minister aliakbar 
velayati and said in measured tones of course we feel badly 
about it or course we have compassion of course we care 
the united states has never willfully acted to endanger 
innocent civilians nor will it ever bush said 
contrast this with the willful detention in inhuman 
conditions of americans and others held hostage against their 
will one course is civilized the other barbaric 
speaking with reporters aboard air force ii on his way to new 
york bush said president reagan decided to put some real 
emphasis on the policy of the united states by elevating the level 
of representation 
his presentation of the us case to the world forum was one of 
bushs most highly visible assignments as vice president and it 
comes just days before democrats assemble in atlanta to formally 
select michael dukakis as their presidential nominee 
it was his first speech to the security council since he served 
there although he addressed the general assembly in 1986 in a 
ceremony honoring the uns 40th anniversary 
aides said that bush was pleased with the way his speech went 
fuller his chiefofstaff declined to say whether the original 
idea for the appearance came from the white house or from the bush 
camp however fuller told reporters he had an interest in doing 
it it was very genuine a reflection of george bushs commitment 
to bring peace to the region 
it was bushs last scheduled public appearance until next 
wednesday when he begins a sixday campaign swing he planned to 
spend most of the time on a private fishing trip in wyoming with 
treasury secretary james a baker iii a close friend and adviser 
speaking with reporters on his plane about the current political 
situation bush said that he was not troubled by dukakis selection 
of sen lloyd bentsen dtexas as his running mate altough called 
it an unusual choice 
asked whether the placement on the ticket of bentsen who had 
defeated him in a 1970 senate race would make him campaign harder 
for texas 29 electoral votes bush said i dont know i 
certainly wont lighten up 
i plan to spend a lot of time in texas anyway i am certainly 
not going to take texas for granted and i will win texas 
the race is going to be determined as i said in 1980 and as i 
said in 1984 by the top of the ticket thats what will determine 
it in texas and elsewhere 
bush also gently rebuked dukakis for his failure to notify 
democrat jesse jackson in advance of his intention to select 
bentsen i dont want to second guess somebody else but you want 
to bend over backwards and be as considerate of other people as 
possible in politicsbush said

the tiniest baby ever to receive a liver 
transplant died thursday two days after doctors divided a donated 
organ between him and another baby in the first us operation of 
its type a spokesman said 
twelveweekold joseph kovach died of heart failure at wyler 
childrens hospital at the university of chicago medical center 
spokesman john easton said 
the boys heart had stopped briefly after the transplant and he 
later suffered kidney and lung failure 
the other baby a 7monthold girl was doing very well but 
was listed in critical and stable condition easton said 
the kovach baby of geneva ill weighed only 42 pounds 
tuesday when he received the transplant which doctors regarded as 
a longshot for saving his life but his only hope said his 
physician peter f whitington 
joseph had previously undergone openheart surgery to correct a 
birth defect but his heart was still weak and the stress of the 
second operation was too much whitington said 
his death will not discourage subsequent double liver 
transplants which could help other youngsters too small to 
accommodate adult livers and likely to die while awaiting scarcer 
childrens organs whitington said 
technically this is not a setback his liver was functioning 
very well this morning even just before he died whitington 
said of course that is not important to joseph kovach 
what we showed with this pair is that its clearly technically 
feasible whitington said we did it under the worst of 
circumstances with a very sick very small baby that needed a 
graft new organ we never would have gotten without a reduction 
in the size of the donor organ 
double liver transplants have been performed previously in 
europe involving adult donors but no double liver transplants had 
been done previously in the united states easton said 
whitington said he told the boys parents that any complications 
at all would result in the childs death and that if it all went 
perfectly there was a small chance he would make it 
joseph suffered from cirrhosis a type of liver damage that can 
exist at birth from an unknown cause 
he was the first child of patty and donald kovach a comptroller 
for a chicago firm easton said 
the other youngster jaclyn manrose of crystal lake ill had a 
hereditary defect called alpha1antitrypsin deficiency an 
insufficent amount of an enzyme that can lead to hepatitis or 
cirrhosis 
jaclyn is one of three children of kathleen and bob manrose a 
maintenance specialist with united airlines easton said 
jaclyn and joseph received the divided liver of a 1yearold 
illinois child who died in an accident the university said 
two younger infants have received new livers at the university 
of pittsburghs transplant center but both babies ages 16 days 
and 3 weeks weighed more than 6 pounds easton said

the us army corps of engineers has rejected 
requests from illinois gov james thompson and other officials for 
increased diversion of water from the great lakes into the 
droughtparched mississippi river an army official said thursday 
we do not feel it is necessary to do it at this time said 
robert page the armys assistant secretary for civil works after 
testifying before the senate merchant marine subcommittee 
the decision was not politically motivated and was based on 
engineering analyses page said 
he said he wrote thompson on thursday to inform the governor of 
the decision 
page said the decision will be subject to review by president 
reagan but the white house placed responsibility with the corps 
we have talked with the administration about this page 
said it is left strictly up to the army corps of engineers 
the decision was in response to reagans request that the corps 
study the need for diversion page said 
thompson and officials from states bordering the mississippi 
asked for increased diversion of great lakes water after levels on 
the river dropped making the channel unnavigable to barge traffic 
barge shippers have estimated losses as a result of the stalled 
shipping at up to 60 million some 3000 barges have been stalled 
as a result of low water 
presently about 3000 cubic feet per second are being diverted 
from the great lakes to the mississippi the officials asked that 
the rate be increased to 10000 cubic feet per second for 100 days 
the governors of four great lakes states opposed the diversion 
and only thompson supported it among the leaders of the eight 
states surrounding the lakes 
canadian officials also protested the proposed diversion 
page said the corps would have the legal authority to increase 
the rate of diversion but would do so only after consultation with 
great lakes states governors 
supporters of diversion argued the increased flow out of the 
lakes would have a miniscule impact on the great lakes but would 
have great benefits downriver 
opponents argued that the lakes water was needed in the midwest 
and northeast and that increasing diversion would set an 
unacceptable precedent 
page said increasing the outflow to 10000 cubic feet per second 
would not do much to help mississippi navigation and shoals would 
continue to impede the flow of goods 
he said the corps foresees through the summer we will still 
have flow on the mississippi 
we see in the foreseeable future based on our forecast we 
dont need increased diversion at all he said

striking paper mill workers thursday called for 
a national boycott of avon products inc because of the cosmetics 
manufacturers ties to international paper co 
the link is stanley gault who serves on the board of directors 
of both companies in addition to his position as chairman and chief 
executive officer of rubbermaid 
avon is a corporate ally of international paper said wayne 
glenn president of the united paperworkers international union 
the union represents 8000 ip workers who for more than a year have 
been on strike locked out or working without a contract at 17 
plants across the country 
the union is calling on women not to buy avon cosmetics 
avon and international paper are two separate companies 
said avon spokesman john cox the mutual board member is the only 
tenuous link between the two companies we think the boycott is 
unwarranted 
gault who was in meetings all day and could not be reached has 
not been approached about resigning from the avon board cox said 
gault who was elected to the board in 1985 also got support 
from ip which said gault is an outside director whose 
independent judgment international paper values highly 
ip spokesman bill fuller in a statement said the boycott was a 
distraction from coming to grips with the things that have to be 
done to put the disputes behind us 
federal law generally prohibits picketing of neutral employers 
but an april supreme court decision said the law does not ban 
nonpicketing activities aimed at such businesses 
the supreme court decision allows us to hold each of ips 
allies directly accountable glenn said also reading from a 
statement 
the union is studying the affiliations of all 15 ip directors 
according to bob frase glenns spokesman 
the avon boycott is the unions first national effort but 
several local boycotts are under way 
the bank of boston is being boycotted because one of its 
directors donald mchenry also serves on the ip board 
in pennsylvania the union has launched a boycott of the pnc 
financial corp w craig mcclelland heads ips hammermill 
subsidiary and sits on the board of pnc financial

independent counsel lawrence e walsh on 
thursday sought a court order to obtain handwriting samples from 
former national security adviser john m poindexter and two arms 
dealers charged in the irancontra conspiracy case 
walsh also sought to obtain photographs of poindexter and the 
two arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj gen 
richard v secord to show to prospective witnesses in the case 
the handwriting samples were needed walsh said because had had 
obtained numerous documents believed to contain the handwriting 
of the various defendants 
poindexter hakim and secord are charged along with fired white 
house aide oliver l north with conspiring to defraud the 
government by diverting profits from the usiran arms sales to 
the nicaraguan contra rebels 
walsh noted that he had already obtained samples of norths 
handwriting as a result of a grand jury subpoena that was the 
subject of a lengthy court battle last year 
north who was cited for contempt of court for refusing to 
supply handwriting samples challenged walshs legal authority to 
obtain grand jury subpoenas a federal appeals court upheld walshs 
authority and enforced the subpoena 
us district judge gerhard a gesell has ordered four separate 
trials and scheduled norths to begin sept 20 
in seeking the handwriting samples from the three defendants 
walsh said it is well settled that a defendant has no valid claim 
of privilege with respect to handwriting examplars 
similarly the government is entitled to take photographs of 
the defendants since it is wellestablished that neither the 
fourth nor the fifth amendment offers any protection against 
compulsion to submit to such photographs 
in a related case us district judge aubrey e robinson jr 
approved the security procedures proposed by walsh for handling 
thousands of pages of documents in the case against former cia 
agent joseph f fernandez 
fernandez who operated in central america under the codename 
tomas castillo is accused of conspiring to set up an illegal 
armssupply network to the nicaraguan rebels and subsequently lying 
to cover up his activities 
the order states that classified documents can only be examined 
in the security facility under supervision of a court security 
officer the same facility was constructed by the justice 
department to house documents turned over to the defendants in the 
other irancontra case

iran said thursday the uss vincennes did 
not warn an iranian airliner before shooting it down but vice 
president george bush responded in the security council that the 
warship fired in selfdefense 
foreign minister aliakbar velayati of iran called the 
destruction of the airliner and the 290 civilians aboard july 3 
the most inhumane military attack in the history of civilian 
aviation a barbaric massacre 
bush said iran should not have sent the airbus into a persian 
gulf battle zone the vincennes and the uss elmer montgomery had 
skirmished with iranian attack boats just before the jetliner 
entered the area 
the vice president who said he was delivering the free 
worlds case called the destruction of the airliner a terrible 
human tragedy but said the united states has a legal right to 
protect persian gulf shipping lames 
we have made it clear that we will keep the gulf open no 
matter what the threat he said we will not alter our course 
velayati read a purported transcript of a communication between 
iran air flight 655 flying from a militarycivilian airport at 
bandar abbas iran across the strait of hormuz to dubai in the 
united arab emirates and the bandar abbas control tower just 
before the attack 
he said the tower told the pilot have a nice day he 
replied thank you good day and the controller answered 
good day 
the united states says the airbus a300 did not respond to 
repeated questioning by the vincennes about its identity and the 
cruisers captain believed it was an iranian f14 fighter 
transmitting ambiguous signals and descending in attack pattern 
in a detailed twohour speech velayati said the airbus never 
heard warnings from the vincennes the plane transmitted only 
unambiguous civilian signals it remained in the recognized 
international air corridor and was climbing when the missiles were 
fired 
every available evidence shows that the pilot of the 
airliner did not receive any warning he told the 15member 
council 
one question is whether the captain of the vincennes actually 
warned the target that it intended to shoot or whether it 
simply decided to shoot on a target which was admittedly 
unidentified at the very least he said 
another question velayati said is why a warship had 
positioned itself right at the center of a civilian airway 
the shooting down of an iranian civil airliner flying on a 
scheduled flight known to the us warships and using an 
internationally established and published civilian airway and 
transmitting signals identifying itself as a civilian airliner 
could not have been a mistake he said 
iran requested the council meeting to seek condemnation of the 
us action and demand withdrawal of all american forces from the 
persian gulf but has been unable to enlist a majority to support a 
resolution 
it had boycotted the security council previously claiming it 
was biased against iran in the iraniraq war 
the meeting was adjourned after velayati and bush spoke and 
neither commented later on the others speech the council session 
with at least 15 speakers scheduled is to resume at 1030 am 
friday and un officials said it could last through the weekend 
it was bushs first speech to the council since he was 
washingtons un ambassador in 19711973 
an appearance by a us vice president is rare us officials 
said the purpose was to lend weight to us arguments about the 
tragedy and emphasize the need to end the 8yearold war 
observers said the speech by bush the certain republican 
nominee for president would emphasize his foreign policy 
credentials and statesmanship 
bush did not dwell on details of the event in his 30minute 
address but defended the us presence in the gulf and the 
decision of the ships captain he urged iran and iraq to accept a 
yearold un ceasefire resolution immediately 
the critical issue confronting this body is not the how and 
why of iran air 655 bush declared it is the continuing 
refusal of iran to comply with resolution 598 to negotiate an end 
to the war with iraq and to cease its acts of aggression against 
neutral shipping in the persian gulf 
i will not dignify with a response the charge that we 
deliberately destroyed iran air 655 the vice president i call 
on iran today to reroute civilian air traffic away from areas of 
active hostilities 
iran allowed a civilian aircraft loaded with passengers to 
proceed on a path over a warship engaged in battle that was 
irresponsible and a tragic error 
after seven unanswered warnings he said the captain did 
what he had to do to protect his ship and the lives of his crew 
bush said the underlying cause of the airline disaster was 
irans refusal to accept a ceasefire iraq says it will accept the 
security council ceasefire resolution if iran does but the 
iranians say no truce is possible until iraq is branded the 
aggressor 
iraq invaded iran in september 1980 after several border 
skirmishes

michael dukakis is the democratic nomineetobe 
but jesse jackson is getting all the attention at least in the 
week before the national convention 
dukakis tended state business in boston on thursday while 
jackson launched a threeday bus trip from chicago to atlanta to 
wrap up his presidential campaign 
dukakis made private phone calls seeking reconciliation with 
jackson jackson made public requests for mediation by former 
president jimmy carter 
youd almost think jackson is the one who won the nomination and 
dukakis is the alsoran 
and thats precisely the trap the massachusetts governor must 
avoid 
above all dukakis needs to come out the atlanta convention next 
friday looking like a man in control of his party and of his own 
destiny 
because dukakis is still a relative unknown to millions of 
voters the sights and impressions from the four nights of 
convention activities on the television screens of america will 
play a major role in shaping the voters thoughts 
the last thing dukakis needs next week is a constant drumbeat of 
questions about what will jesse do competing with the music 
inside the convention hall 
it is certain that dukakis doesnt need jacksons votes inside 
the omni next week to run the convention the massachusetts 
governor has plenty of delegates to stay in charge 
but dukakis does need the votes of millions of jacksons 
supporters outside the hall to beat republican george bush on nov 
8 
at the same time he must avoid the appearance that he is 
pandering to jackson or caving in to the civil rights leaders 
demands 
the appearance of pandering to jackson and his supporters 
damaged walter mondale in his 1984 campaign for the white house 
planting doubts about mondales toughness and his ability to handle 
the demands of special interests 
on thursday jackson demonstrated once again why it is so hard 
to negotiate with this man who has honed the tools of public 
relations and electronic media into powerful bargaining tools 
the preacherturnedpolitician demanded center stage again with 
a single stroke 
it grabs the headlines with a wellknown name 
it puts two prominent men on the spot dukakis and carter 
carter would certainly like to be helpful but how to do so is a 
tricky question 
dukakis cant very well ignore a former president but he surely 
doesnt want carter involved in this either intermediaries just 
complicate things 
moreover democrats dont really want carter in the spotlight 
very long at this convention 
the memories of carters years in the white house are not ones 
that dukakis and democrats want to revive soaring prices gasoline 
lines and iranian hostages were not a pretty picture 
this latest squabble between the campaigns may simply turn out 
to be a little entertainment before the main event 
jackson gets to town on saturday afternoon and dukakis on 
sunday the two will probably meet privately 
what is said at the meeting and the pictures that the nation 
sees after it could well set the tone for the entire convention

south african and cuban 
officials said thursday that major issues remain unresolved 
following a milestone agreement aimed at easing conflict in angola 
and southwest africa 
south africas foreign minister roelof f botha said president 
pw botha who are not related will preside over a government 
meeting next week to decide whether to accept the principles agreed 
upon by delegates after three days of talks in new york 
a cuban official in new york said a us mediators assertion 
that agreement in principle had been reached on a cuban withdrawal 
from angola was inexact this issue remained under discussion 
the cuban said 
state department and south african officials at the united 
nations in new york however on thursday called it merely a matter 
of semantics they said cuba did agree to bring its troops home 
but expressed that in a statement of principles not in what 
diplomats would call an agreement 
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
on wednesday us assistant secretary of state chester crocker 
said angolan cuban and south african negotiators agreed on a set 
of principles aimed at removing cuban troops from angola and ending 
south africas 73year rule over southwest africa also known as 
namibia 
the agreement will be referred back to the three governments if 
they approve another round of negotiations probably would be held 
next month 
the negotiators did not resolve the most contentious issue a 
timetable for the cuban withdrawal and implementation of un 
resolution 435 which outlines a procedure for granting 
independence to namibia 
on thursday a cuban delegate differed with crockers account of 
the talks 
it is not precise to say that an agreement has been reached on 
the withdrawal of cuban troops said alcibiades hidalgo a member 
of the central committee of cubas communist party 
this issue is part of all the discussions is part of a 
process that is continuing he said it is our opinion that we 
made substantial progress 
the agreement linking the withdrawal of cuban forces from 
angola to south african withdrawal from namibia received lowkey 
treatment in south africa 
the road is still far that we have to travel but as of now 
the momentum and confidence have been established to enable us to 
continue neil van heerden directorgeneral of foreign affairs 
and head of the south african delegation was quoted as saying 
crocker said the negotiators in new york decided it was not yet 
time to address the timing of the cuban withdrawal 
south africa and the united states would like to see the 
estimated 50000 cubans leave angola within a year the same 
timetable the united nations has suggested for south african 
withdrawal from namibia 
the cubans and angolans have said in the past it would take four 
years and that south african and american military support for the 
unita guerrillas must end first unita stands for the national 
union for the total independence of angola 
one of the first steps would be withdrawal of south african 
troops from angola south africa has said it has a maximum of about 
3000 troops in angola while its foes claimed 9000 south africans 
were there last year fighting alongside unita 
more than 45 white south african soldiers have died in angola in 
the past year and each death brings more domestic pressure on the 
government to justify its military policy 
crocker said the south african administration in namibia would 
be replaced by un civil and military administrators to comply 
with un resolution 435 south africa has said it would accept the 
resolution only after the cubans leave angola 
in washington un ambassador vernon walters told cbs this 
morning that many obstacles remain 
this war has been going on for 15 years theres a whole lot 
of hostility built up he said 
the united states was a party to the talks because it has been 
supporting unita with funds and weapons since 1985 
asked if the united states would continue backing the rebels 
walters said thats a decision taken in the light of 
circumstances 
the 13yearold civil war in angola despite the presence of 
cuban and south african troops is chiefly between the marxist 
government forces and unita 
in namibia the southwest african peoples organization has been 
fighting a guerrilla war for 22 years to end south african 
occupation and gain control of an independent government

a cuban official on thursday called 
inexact a us statement saying cuban negotiators reached 
agreement in principle to withdraw cubas troops from angola 
but state department and south african officials said it was 
just a matter of semantics that cuba did agree to bring its 
troops home but expressed that view in a statement of 
principles not in what diplomats would call an agreement 
the officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
cuban angolan and south african negotiators initialed a 
statement of principles wednesday calling for cuban troops to leave 
the marxistruled southern african nation of angola and for south 
africa to end its 73year rule over namibia said chester crocker 
the us mediator for the talks 
they did not agree on a timetable for the cuban withdrawal at 
private meetings this week said crocker the state department 
undersecretary for african affairs on wednesday 
alcibiades hidalgo a cuban negotiator and member of the central 
committee of cubas communist party said thursday 
i would say it is not precise to say that an agreement has 
been reached on the withdrawal of cuban troops 
this issue is part of all the discussions is part of a 
process that is continuing i would qualify it as inexact to say 
that an agreement has been reached on the withdrawal of all cuban 
troops 
it is our opinion that we made substantial progress 
hidalgo spoke in spanish through an interpreter at a news 
conference at the cuban mission to the united nations 
a state department official on thursday saw no real 
contradiction saying we have never used the term agreement 
what the cubans agreed to is a set of principles it doesnt 
constitute a specific agreement 
the principles agreed to must now be signed by the angolan 
cuban and south african governments 
military and political experts from those countries will meet in 
august to work out details for a comprehensive settlement 
a south african diplomat noted that the document cuba initialed 
refers to a peaceful settlement in southwestern africa 
showing that a settlement of the southern angola problem is part of 
the set of principles 
south africa has said it would accept a un security council 
resolution calling for the independence of southwest africa 
commonly called namibia when the estimated 50000 cuban troops 
withdraw from neighboring angola 
the us goal is a full cuban troop withdrawal in one year the 
same time span that un resolution 435 sets for granting 
independence to namibia 
angola and cuba had insisted that cuban withdrawal take place 
over four years 
the united states was a party to the talks because it has been 
supporting anticommunist rebels in angola with funds and weapons 
since 1985 
angola has been fighting a civil war since it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 battling anticommunist rebels 
in the south who call themselves unita for national union for the 
total independence of angola 
south africa has repeatedly sent troops from namibia into angola 
to support unita forces in the fighting 
south africa has ruled namibia since world war i under a league 
of nations mandate to administer the territory the leagues 
successor the united nations revoked that mandate 
the four parties began their meetings in london last may

members of the senate energy and natural 
resources committee started staking out consumervsproducer 
positions thursday for seats on the federal energy regulatory 
commission 
the manuevering found the senior republican on the panel lined 
up with producingstate democrats in an impasse that if not 
resolved could leave the commission paralyzed for lack of a quorum 
the occasion was a hearing on the nomination of elizabeth anne 
moler to the commission whose confirmation senators said is not in 
question she is a 12year veteran natural gas expert on the 
committee staff who is supported by all the committee members 
the fivemember commission regulates natural gas pipelines some 
wellhead gas pricing oil pipelines hydroelectric dams and 
wholesale electricity sales and oversees state regulation of small 
power producers the commission must always have a 32 party split 
currently in favor of the republicans 
members may serve for up to a year after their fouryear terms 
expire if no successor has been confirmed 
if confirmed ms moler would replace democrat charles stalon 
who has been serving since his term expired last october 
despite a warning from committee chairman bennett johnston 
dla and ranking republican james mcclure ridaho that stalon 
could not be confirmed again president reagan nominated stalon to 
fill a vacant seat formerly held by a texas democrat for a term 
expiring in october 1989 
if you look at the composition of the commission its obvious 
there is a demand for a seat for a producingstate democrat and 
confirmation of stalon and moler would leave no room for one 
mcclure told reporters after the hearing he said he hoped stalons 
nomination would be withdrawn 
stalon is an economist from illinois and former member of that 
states commerce commission who was the chief architect behind the 
commissions regulations encouraging natural gas pipelines to 
transmit gas for all comers he has stongly pushed deregulatory 
initiatives for electricity generation 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio has backed stalon as a needed 
voice for consumers on the commission he said he was forwarding an 
endorsement of stalon by 19 senators of both parties 
clearly he has served the commission well as a voice of 
moderation and balance among the competing interests of the energy 
regulatory area metzenbaum said 
johnston said he believed the commission should go slow on 
current proposed regulations aimed at making it easier for 
independent electric generators those without transmission or 
retail networks to do business this initiative is opposed by 
most utilities but strongly backed by a minority of companies 
ferc chairwoman martha hesse is known to be eager to get the 
proposals adopted and stalon supports her commissioner charles 
trabandt is opposed 
commissioner anthony sousa has not taken a position and is 
expected to leave the commission this summer 
thus if ms moler replaced stalon and stalon were not confirmed 
for the vacancy she could find herself the swing vote on the issue

here are excerpts of the speech to the 
security council on thursday by foreign minister aliakbar velayati 
of iran delivered in farsi and translated by the iranian mission 
in the morning of sunday july 2 1988 families and friends of 
290 passengers and crew said farewell to their loved ones in tehran 
and bandar abbas airports unaware of the dastardly attack that 
awaited them unaware of the tragic destiny that would be imposed 
upon them by a reckless and incompetent naval force led by 
aggressive and expansionist policymakers 
according to the transcript of the communication between the 
pilot and bandar abbas tower before permission for takeoff was 
granted the tower asked the pilot to make sure that his transponder 
was turned on positive response from the pilot was received 
the plane was flying on a scheduled flight using the 
internationally established and published amber 59 airway that is 
used at least 14 times a week five of which between the same two 
airports the plane was then climbing to the prescribed altitude at 
about 320 knots per hour 
seconds after the last communication between the plane and the 
tower the plane was targeted by two surfacetoair standard guided 
missiles from uss vincennes the most technologically sophisticated 
naval ship the plane ws shot when it was at the center line of 
amber 59 airway 
uss vincennes had well over 14 minutes and not four minutes as 
american officials have claimed of prior knowledge that the 
target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from bandar 
abbas to dubai 
another story which was fabricated to misguide the international 
public opinion was the claim by the united states that the airliner 
was not transmitting the appropriate signals 
adm crowe claimed on july 3 1988 there were electronic 
indications on vincennes that led it to believe that the aircraft 
was an f14 
notwithstanding the fact that the iranian air force had no f14 
operations in the morning of that unfortunate sunday in or around 
the strait of hormuz it may be noted that the military experts 
wellfamiliar with f14 and its capabilities have held that f14 
could not have presented any serious danger to the uss vincennes or 
any surface target for that matter 
f14 fighters as it should be known most vividly to the 
americans who made them are designed for airtoair attack and not 
airtosurface operations 
possibly the most fallacious argument of the american officials 
in justifying their inexplicable crime was a claim that the 
airliner did not respond to the alleged warnings issued by the 
warship 
while every available evidence including the transcripts read 
earlier show that the pilot of the airliner did not receive any 
warning many have contended that in such a short and routine 
flight the pilot was not indeed required to monitor the emergency 
civilian frequency 
furthermore because the ship failed to identify the target of 
its alleged warnings the pilot of the airliner of a scheduled 
flight should not have reasonably taken it as directed against 
himself 
finally the most awkward american explanation for shooting down 
a civilian airliner was presented by adm crowe who claimed that 
the plane was coming onto the uss vincennes in a war zone while 
descending and increasing speed of 450 miles an hour 
it is necessary to note that the area where the plane was 
attacked is well outside the declared war zones of the combatants 
this fact is attested to even by lloyds of london 
the question that needs to be asked is why a warship had 
positioned itself right at the center of a civilian airway 
furthermore positioning itself right in the middle of an 
international civil airway it is ironic that the ship expected the 
plane to go outside of the corridor not be coming onto the 
vincennes 
all available evidence suggests that the shooting down of an 
iranian civil airliner could not have been a mistake certainly 
the huge difference in appearance size weight and flight pattern 
between an airbus and those of an f14 whic is almost a fourth of 
the former would make any claim of mistaken identity absurd 
rather the course of events during that day clearly shows that 
the us warships in the area had clear aggressive intentions 
which resulted in the massacre of 290 innocent people

sen lloyd bentsen refused thursday to be 
drawn into the rift between jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
saying its up to dukakis to mend relations between the two camps 
smoothing over tensions with jackson is gov dukakis 
responsiblity said bentsen who was selected for the running 
mate spot jackson had coveted 
i know he dukakis has a high regard for reverend jackson i 
assume hell have a meeting with jackson bentsen said in a 
session with reporters from his home state 
once again thats a matter of communication with reverend 
jackson he said 
bentsen said he had no plans to meet personally with jackson 
who was irked at learning of bentsens selection tuesday from 
reporters before he heard from dukakis bentsen did however call 
jackson on wednesday and described it as a good conversation 
a personal conversation 
jackson received an apology thursday from one of dukakis top 
advisers but said he was still asking former president carter to 
intercede on wednesday jackson said the floor was wide open 
on the vice presidential vote next thursday night at the democratic 
national convention in atlanta 
bentsen said its up to jackson to decide whether to stage a 
floor fight over the vice presidential nomination 
bentsen a conservative democrat whose positions differ greatly 
from those of dukakis on such issues as an oil import fee aid to 
the nicaraguan contras and the death penalty said he was 
looking for a good exchange of communication with the 
massachusetts governor 
but were in accord on job creation education child care 
health care having babies born with sound minds and bodies these 
are the things we share bentsen said 
bentsen who once said the office of vice president was an empty 
job has changed his mind and is convinced dukakis wants and will 
treat him as a trusted adviser 
bentsen said he consulted with dukakis former lieutenant 
governor john kerry and studied the character of the man not 
diagrams and charts before accepting the job 
that was my major question was i really going to be able to 
communicate counsel and advise bentsen said i kept checking 
and studying and became convinced it could be a meaningful 
job 
and dukakis has assured him he very much wants to have my 
input bentsen said people told me that was his nature 
bentsen believes he was chosen dukakis running mate because of 
his legislative experience which exposes you to so many facets of 
this country of ours his proven ability to work with congress 
and his exposure though the years to various heads of state 
a senator since 1970 bentsen is being opposed in his 
reelection bid this year by rep beau boulter a republican 
bentsen is legally allowed to run both races under a law passed in 
texas that allowed lyndon b johnson to run for vice president with 
john f kennedy as well as the senate 
bentsen believes he and dukakis will take texas and its trove of 
29 electoral votes as they campaign against adopted texan george 
bush 
i think it will be close i think it will be tough but i 
think well win it bentsen said 
vamos a ver he said in spanish for were going to see

united nations shortly before flight 655 was shot out of the 
sky above the persian gulf on july 3 the bandar abbas tower had 
these words of cheer for the departed iran air flight with 290 
people aboard have a nice day 
flight 655 responded thank you good day 
tower good day 
that was at 1024 am 
then nothing 
iran presented thursday to the security council what it said was 
a 14minute transcript of communications in english between the 
iranian airbus and control towers in bandar abbas where it took 
off tehran where it originated and dubai in the united arab 
emirates its destination 
irans foreign minister aliakbar velayati said the uss 
vincennes must have heard the same communications which clearly 
identified the craft as a civilian airliner velayati said the 
plane is identified its altitude and course given its destination 
known and its transponder was on and transmitting its identity on 
an internationally recognized civilian channel 
based on these easily verifiable facts valayati said uss 
vincennes had well over 14 minutes and not four minutes as 
american officials have claimed of prior knowledge that the 
target was a civilian airliner on a scheduled flight from bandar 
abbas to dubai 
the transcript begins at 1010 am bandar abbas time when the 
pilot requests permission to start up his engine 
the tower asked the pilot to make sure his transponder was 
turned on and the pilot said it was 
the plane took off at 1017 am for dubai seven minutes after 
the initial contact with the tower 
the last communication between the pilot and bandar abbas tower 
was recorded at 1024 am a routine exchange when the pilot did 
not report any unusual or emergency condition 
vice president george bush told the council the vincennes crew 
sent seven unaswered warnings to the airliner before shooting it 
down believing it to be an f14 on an attack course 
one question that needs to be seriously examined velayati 
said is whether the captain of the uss vincennes actually warned 
its target that it intended to shoot or whether it simply 
decided to shoot on a target which was admittedly unidentified at 
the very least

jackie pressers handpicked choice to succeed 
him and the international brotherhood of teamsters top official in 
new england are locked in what labor sources say is a tight race 
for the unions presidency 
the teamsters 17member general executive board meets here 
friday to pick a successor to presser who died last saturday 
following 18 months of treatment for cancer presser 61 had been 
the teamsters president since 1983 
speaking on condition of anonymity several sources said the 
next teamsters president may get the post with a margin of only 
one vote 
weldon mathis the teamsters secretarytreasurer and acting 
president since may under an appointment from presser was expected 
months ago to win election easily to the top job upon pressers 
death 
but that was before a large rankandfile rebellion over terms 
of the unions two largest contracts with united parcel service and 
the interstate trucking industry both were declared ratified even 
though they were voted down by a majority of the covered members 
mathis is on the executive board along with 16 teamster vice 
presidents many of whom at some time during the past two months 
had seen themselves as succeeding presser 
in the past week the competition to lead the nations largest 
union one in every 75 american workers is a teamster for a 
membership of 16 million has evolved into a twoman race between 
mathis and william j mccarthy of boston sources close to the 
union said thursday 
forces aligned with 70yearold joseph trerotola of new york 
the unions ranking vice president and head of its east coast 
operations since 1969 have united behind mccarthy sources said 
thursday 
the presser forces have lined up behind mathis and the 
trerotola forces have lined up behind mccarthy one source said 
everyones reading is that it is real close 
mccarthy 68 is said by several sources to have the support of 
at least seven board members other than himself 
mathis 62 whose career with the teamsters began in atlanta is 
believed to have an equal number although one source said he has 
solidified support since may 
another source described the contest as pretty close but 
added that all 17 board members appeared to have made up their 
minds on which way they would vote when they were last together at 
pressers funeral tuesday in cleveland 
breaking union tradition mccarthy has been an outspoken critic 
of the new threeyear national master freight agreement covering 
some 200000 teamsters in the trucking industry 
according to one source mathis offered during a board meeting 
two weeks ago in montreal to support mccarthy for the no 2 job but 
mccarthy declined 
whatever the count is in the closeddoor meeting friday the 
teamsters are expected to follow their customary practice and 
announce a unanimous vote for the winner when it all is over 
that is what happened in 1983 when presser was elected over don 
peters a veteran teamster official in chicago to succeed roy 
williams upon williams 10year prison sentence on a conviction of 
attempting to bribe a us senator 
officially the union is mum on the power struggle duke zeller 
a spokesman for the union said the only item on the agenda is 
naming a new president and possibly a new secretarytreasurer 
historically it goes pretty quickly zeller said but 
anything can happen 
the selection will occur just two weeks after the government 
filed a suit seeking to place control of the entire union under a 
courtappointed trustee saying all of its top officials have 
allowed the teamsters to be controlled by leaders of organized 
crime families 
among the allegations in the suit are that mob bosses in chicago 
and new york were the forces behind elevating williams to the 
unions presidency in 1981 and presser to the post in 1983 
a federal criminal court jury in may found that the government 
lacked sufficient proof of that and attorneys for the union have 
vehemently argued their is no organized crime influence at the top 
of the union 
at the time of his death presser was awaiting trial on federal 
charges of labor racketeering and embezzlement in connection with 
an alleged payrollpadding scheme at a cleveland local that he also 
headed he had pleaded innocent to the charges

leaders of five warsaw pact countries 
arrived thursday to join soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in a 
twoday summit expected to focus on reductions in nuclear and 
conventional weapons 
the meeting friday and saturday was to be the first of the 
politicalconsultative council of the warsaw treaty organization 
since the ussoviet summit that ended june 2 in moscow 
the session will be gorbachevs first opportunity to brief his 
fellow communist leaders on his meeting with president reagan the 
superpower leaders exchanged ratified copies of a treaty to ban 
short and mediumrange nuclear weapons most of which are deployed 
in europe 
enactment of the accord focuses new attention on longstalled 
efforts to reduce conventional forces in europe and gorbachev 
indicated that would be a priority item on the agenda of the warsaw 
pact meeting 
talks on conventional force levels are to resume in vienna this 
fall and gorbachev suggested upon his arrival in poland on monday 
that informal talks be held to search for a new starting point that 
could lead to progress 
poland and the ussr as parties to the warsaw treaty 
attach special importance to the quickest possible inauguration of 
negotiations on the reduction of armed forces and conventional 
armaments in europe said a communique issued by the two 
countries on thursday as gorbachev concluded a fourday tour of 
poland in advance of the summit 
both countries are resolutely in favor of removing 
disproportions and asymmetries existing in this area and are 
ready for a realistic and constructive dialogue on the subject 
the communique added 
the nato countries contend that communist forces hold a 
dangerous twotoone advantage tanks and artillery deployed in the 
border regions separating east and west europe 
in a speech to parliament monday the first day of his sixday 
visit to poland gorbachev proposed withdrawing an unspecified 
number of analagous warsaw pact air forces if nato agreed not 
to deploy 72 usbuilt f16 fighterjets in italy 
speculation that the warsaw pact may be preparing for a dramatic 
force pullback was raised in washington last week when a us 
state department official said intelligence reports indicated the 
soviet union was preparing to remove some or all of its 65000 
troops in hungary 
joining gorbachev and polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski for 
the warsaw pact meeting are leaders from the other five pact 
nations 
romanian leader nicholae ceaucescu czechoslovak leader milos 
jakes bulgarian leader todor zhivkov east german leader erich 
honecker and hungarian leader karoly grosz all arrived in warsaw 
late thursday 
it was warsaws turn to host the annual session of the communist 
defense alliance founded in this polish capital in 1955 
the pact has been showing a greater degree of diversity in 
recent years with members taking divergent courses in response to 
gorbachevs program of perestroika or reform 
the meeting of eastern european chiefs comes barely two weeks 
after the soviet unions 19th communist party conference which 
endorsed an extension of gorbachevs political and economic reforms 
poland and hungary tend to be the pacts most enthusiastic 
backers of reform czechoslovakia and bulgaria are taking a more a 
cautious approach while east germany shows only grudging interest 
in conducting similar reforms 
romania where power is concentrated almost entirely in the 
hands of ceaucescu is conspicuously out of step with the reform 
trend and sharply critical of it

sen albert gore jr of tennessee whose 
democratic presidential campaign fell flat outside the south has 
raised enough money to pay off his more than 2 million campaign 
debt a spokesman said thursday 
gore was celebrating the achievement done without help from 
successful democratic candidate michael dukakis campaign at a 
dinner with major fund raisers at the tennessee governors mansion 
in nashville thursday evening 
mike kopp gores press secretary said the defunct campaign 
raised more than 1 million in contributions and is due to receive 
the balance needed to retire the debt in federal campaign money 
matching the contributions 
gore owed 15 million based on his latest federal election 
commission report on june 20 but kopp said the campaign calculated 
the final amount owed would be 21 million 
we have as of this evening cash on hand of a little over 1 
million kopp said a lot of that came in overnight express 
packages this morning 
kopp said between 170 and 200 gore fund raisers each of whom 
raised anywhere from 5000 to more than 40000 against the debt 
were attending the dinner and private concert by gore supporter and 
country singer johnny cash and his band also providing 
entertainment was singer crystal gayle 
gore withdrew from the presidential race following a poor third 
place showing in the new york primary he scored victories in his 
native south on super tuesday but was unable to match them 
elsewhere

the state motor vehicles division has 
decided that no matter what the word petard means in french 
its ok for bill and donna brewster to use it on their mercedes 
mrs brewster operates a business by the same name 
someone complained to the division that petard is a french 
colloquialism meaning to break wind the division ordered the 
brewsters to turn in their plate because it carried offensive and 
vulgar connotations 
brewster appealed 
armed with a pair of dictionaries brewster argued before a 
state hearings officer april 14 that although the word may have 
vulgar roots petard today is neither vulgar nor offensive 
we got a letter brewster said tuesday seven pages of 
gobbledygook but we won 
the websters new world dictionary college edition defines 
petard as an explosive device used in ancient times to force an 
opening in a wall or gate and a firecracker however the latin 
and french roots of the word do mean to break wind the dictionary 
adds 
but the dictionary also notes the use in shakespeares hamlet of 
the phrase hoist with ones own petard meaning to be caught 
in ones own trap

artistic freedom scentific cooperation and a renewed marxist 
dialogue with religion

he said is intended to improve the lives of everyday people

and some participants did not require earphones to listen to a 
translation 
physicist jan rychlewski then took the floor he suggested that 
socialist countries each concentrate their research in a few 
limited fields to avoid being left behind by the west 
speaking in emotional tones rychlewski then apologized for 
bringing up a topic which i ought not mention 
in the name of my family in the name of my community i would 
like to thank the 19th cpsu communist party of the soviet union 
conference and the delegates to that conference here for the 
decision to erect in moscow the monument to the victims of

role in polish society despite the officially atheistic stance of 
the ruling communist party 
stelmachowski the catholic club president speaking from home 
after the meeting said he found the discussion interesting but 
that gorbachevs brief reply promising written responses in a 
volume to be published later left a feeling of hunger 
he said he was vaguely reminded of the trip to warsaw in the 
19th century of czar alexander ii the czar promised reforms but in 
the end repressed polish aspirations after a popular revolt against 
russian rule in 1863

gov michael dukakis pulled even with vice 
president george bush in texas after naming sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas as his democratic running mate cbs news reported thursday 
night 
the poll of 580 registered voters on tuesday and wednesday found 
48 percent supporting dukakis to 44 percent for bush the margin of 
error was plus or minus four percentage points making the race a 
dead heat 
polls that were taken before dukakis selected bentsen on tuesday 
have found a big bush lead in texas but showed the lead narrowing 
to a dead heat if bentsen were chosen the cbs poll confirmed that 
outcome 
in another poll tuesday dukakis led bush by 10 points 
nationally a margin roughly in line with other recent national 
surveys the new poll by nbc news and the wall street journal was 
done before dukakis chose bentsen 
dukakis selection of bentsen was seen as a homestate challenge 
to bush who maintains an apartment in houston but the cbs texas 
poll found that 57 percent of respondents do not think of bush as a 
real texan 
bush was rated favorably by 44 percent of texas voters and 
unfavorably by 33 percent dukakis had a lower favorable rating 37 
percent but also a slightly lower unfavorable score 28 percent 
bentsen did better than either with a 55 percent favorable 
rating and an unfavorable rating of only 15 percent moreover 21 
percent said having bentsen on the ticket made them more likely to 
vote for dukakis 
the texans also said they favored bentsen for reelection to the 
senate over republican rep beau boulter 6420 but 61 percent 
said bentsen should withdraw from the senate race now that he is to 
run for vice president even though texas law allows him to seek 
both seats 
in the national poll by nbc and the journal dukakis 10point 
lead was 5 points lower than in an nbcjournal poll a month ago 
the poll was conducted july 811 among 1695 registered voters and

ptls bankruptcy trustee said thursday 
that more guests at the heritage grand hotel and income from 
heritage usas new water park are helping offset donations that 
have plummeted to 25000 a day 
mc red benton said the water park and steppedup business 
at the hotel are bringing in about another 25000 a day but with 
the dwindling donations the ptl ministry is still falling short of 
the 60000 a day it needs to operate 
the difference is coming from profits from the sale of ptl 
property that was sold this spring he said 
benton said another round of onair appeals for donations will 
begin soon to remind viewers of ptls television viewers of the 
need for money 
the lowest donations have fallen is 22000 a day in late may 
benton said increased ontheair appeals got the donations 
temporarily back up to about 100000 a day but theyve steadily 
declined ever since 
benton said efforts to find a buyer for heritage usa continue 
the ministry is working with several interested buyers including 
charlotte businessman george shinn and ousted ptl founder jim 
bakker he said 
benton also has established a friday deadline for a 50 million 
deposit by australian businessman gavin morehu who has said he 
plans to offer 200 million to buy heritage usa 
were still waiting on somebody to come up with a deposit 
he said thursday 
benton said he asked morehu to deposit the money in escrow as 
evidence of ability to make good on the offer and he probably 
would grant an extension of two or three days if one is requested 
bruce french director of sales and marketing at heritage usa 
said the water park is averaging just below 1000 people per day 
were particularly happy with the regional attendance 
french said in the past we counted on our visitors to be the 
bulk of our attendance this year weve turned that around and 
decided to market to the area

some 153 members of congress have written 
secretary of state george shultz that the iranian opposition rather 
than us intervention offers the best hope of overthrowing 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
it is not our role to go to war with iran said the letter 
obtained thursday by the associated press 
we believe the ultimate solution to the iranian problem must 
come from within iran itself said the letter the people of 
the country must remove khomeini and the mullahs and replace them 
with a government that is more humane to its own citizens and less 
belligerent toward other countries of the world 
the letter was dated june 20 nearly two weeks before the july 3 
us shootdown of iran air flight 655 that killed all 290 people 
aboard 
the copy of the letter bore the signatures of sen dennis 
deconcini dariz and reps jack kemp rny helen delich 
bentley rmd and mervyn m dymally dcalif 
a statement from dymallys office said thursday that in the end 
14 senators and 139 representatives signed the letter 
the statement said the reagan administration had been trying to 
establish a relationship with moderate elements of the khomeini 
regime but that the letter was meant to stress that a longterm 
solution to the problems in the persian gulf is more likely to 
come from popular opposition to government policies within iran 
than through outside efforts to stimulate change 
the letter said the iranian resistance had told us that 
antikhomeini protests have recently occurred within iran and 
noted that iran had suffered reverses in fighting with iraq and 
with the iraqbased national liberation army of the peoples 
mujahedeen of iran 
the measured yet decisive response shown by the 
administration to irans minings against our ships demonstrates our 
resolve to protect our interests without fullscale war it said 
the members also commended the administration for pressing its 
efforts for a unsponsored arms and oil embargo to pressure iran 
to end the war 
the statement from dymallys office said those signing the 
letter included sens david karnes rneb and paul simon dill 
as well as reps edward feighan dohio donald lukens rohio 
peter kostmayer dpa robert lagomarsino rcalif and 
christopher smith rnj 
a dymally spokesman who asked not to be identified said the 
statement included only those names because those members had 
approved the statement he said he had been unable to check the 
statement with the other signers of the letter before releasing it 
and therefore did not release their names

jesse jackson asked former president carter on thursday to play 
peacemaker in his preconvention dispute with michael dukakis 
saying i simply want respect and responsibility after the long 
run for the democratic presidential nomination 
dukakis six days away from officially becoming his partys 
nominee said that despite the tension he expects jackson to join 
him and running mate lloyd bentsen in a convention display of unity 
vice president george bush needled dukakis from afar saying he 
thought the governor could have shown a little more sensitivity 
toward his rival in the manner in which he announced his choice of 
bentsen bush also went to the united nations where he made a 
highvisibility defense of us actions in shooting down an iranian 
airliner 
while there is plenty of time to settle matters before the 
convention opens next monday jacksons complaints could wind up 
threatening efforts by dukakis and democratic party leaders to 
stage a unified harmonious party meeting 
dukakis told cbs news in an interview he tried but failed to 
reach jackson by phone on tuesday to tell him of bentsens 
selection he said jackson should take no offense from their 
failure to make a connection 
obviously in a contest like this somebody wins and somebody 
loses and im the guy whos won and its my job to go out and pick 
a running mate said dukakis 
asked if the convention audience would witness a final display 
of dukakisbentsenjackson unity he said i expect that you 
will 
jackson did not specify any issues he wanted carter to mediate 
he said he was not seeking a personal apology for dukakis 
failure to notify him before word got out that bentsen had been 
picked for the vice presidential slot on the ticket 
in chicago at a news conference before boarding a bus caravan 
for the convention jackson said he would exercise all of our 
rights at the fourday meeting and added its an open 
question whether he will challenge bentsens nomination in 
atlanta 
dukakis his nomination assured spent the day working on state 
budget problems and burnishing his credentials as a governor who 
cracks down on drugs the massachusetts governor visited two state 
troopers shot during an undercover drug operation and signed a 
state law requiring tougher sentences for cocaine dealers 
were serious about a war on drugs in this state he said 
bentsen spent the day in the senate he told reporters that 
easing the tension with jackson was governor dukakis 
responsibility i know he has a high regard for rev jackson i 
assume hell have a meeting with jackson 
meanwhile cbs said a new survey in texas indicates that dukakis 
has pulled even with bush since naming bentsen as his running mate 
a marked improvement in his standing a poll of 580 registered 
voters on tuesday and wednesday found 48 percent supporting dukakis 
to 44 percent for bush the margin of error was plus or minus four 
percentage points making the race a dead heat 
bert lance who has advised jackson during the presidential 
campaign said he believed dukakis rival would eventually support 
the partys ticket its in the best interest of jesse jackson 
in my opinion to see a democrat elected in november said lance 
who once served as carters federal budget director 
carter declined comment on jacksons statements and dukakis 
aides sought to minimize the dispute 
democratic party officials held a symbolic ribboncutting 
ceremony to mark the transformation of the omni hall into a 
convention city complete with a huge movable podium in pastel 
shades designed to be more pleasing to the eye than the 
traditional red white and blue 
but if the hammering and sawing was nearly finished the 
political maneuvering was in full swing 
black members of congress predicted boisterous protests at the 
convention over what they see as a snub to jackson 
but some of the lawmakers also said they would try to hold a 
meeting with dukakis aides or perhaps the governor himself next 
week in an effort to repair the breach 
clearly the way jesse jackson was dealt with on a personal 
basis looms as a monumental issue said rep ron dellums 
dcalif 
jacksons call on carter a georgian who has remained generally 
out of the spotlight since his defeat in 1980 came as party 
chairman paul kirk and other democratic leaders appealed for unity 
to prevent the convention from deteriorating into a primetime tug 
of war 
officials spread the word that dukakis had called jackson on 
wednesday and a jackson aide termed the call a good start at 
repairing relations 
both kirk and house speaker jim wright convention chairman 
urged unity on the bickering sides wright predicted a harmonious 
convention that will unite all factions and demonstrate that our 
party is ready to govern 
for the moment at least there seemed little harmony 
the most recent round of acrimony began when jackson who 
wanted the second spot on the ticket for himself learned of 
bentsens selection from a reporter on tuesday morning 
jackson told reporters in chicago that dukakis aide paul 
brountas apologized for the way the notification was handled 
he said he had talked to carter and he wants to serve in any 
way he can 
but he said i do not seek a personal apology the progressive 
wing of the democratic party seeks inclusion 
the issue of my constituency is not about the timing of a 
call he said we want inclusion in the party at every level 
dukakis spokesman mark gearan said of wednesdays 
dukakisjackson phone call the governor obviously made it clear 
that it was his own intention for the rev jackson and all of the 
candidates to hear the news from no one else but the governor 
gearan characterized the conversation as friendly but declined to 
say whether the governor had apologized 
jackson spokesman ron brown termed dukakis gesture an 
important call and a good start toward healing relations but 
made it clear he expects there will be numerous conversations 
between the two men in the days ahead 
bentsen went about his senate rounds as usual although the 
jockeying already was beginning among texas politicians eager to 
replace him in congress if he wins the vice presidency 
bush traveled to the united nations to represent the united 
states at a security council debate over the navys downing of a 
civilian iranian airliner in the persian gulf he called the 
incident a terrible human tragedy but defended the actions of 
the navy commander who gave the order to fire and said iran shares 
responsibility in the 290 deaths for sending its plane into a 
battle region 
jackson has ordered aides to break off negotiations with dukakis 
forces over the party platform kirk in atlanta said those talks 
had not yet resumed although he said aides to the two men had 
spoken

state is serious about a war on drugs visited two state 
troopers shot during an undercover drug operation and signed 
tougher sentencing standards for cocaine dealers 
dukakis only days away from accepting the democratic 
presidential nomination spent most of thursday working on state 
budget problems while aides tried to ease the continuing tension 
between their camp and jesse jackson 
spokesman mark gearan said a facetoface meeting between 
dukakis and jackson likely would be arranged after both arrive 
sunday in atlanta for the democratic national convention but he 
said no such talk had been scheduled 
dukakis in a broadcast interview defended his choice of sen 
lloyd bentsen of texas as a running mate despite jacksons 
interest in the job 
obviously in a contest like this somebody wins and somebody 
loses and im the guy whos won and its my job to go out and pick 
a running mate he said in an interview with cbs 
however asked if the convention audience would witness a final 
display of dukakisbentsenjackson unity he said i expect that 
you will 
in chicago meanwhile jackson called on former president carter 
to play the role of peacemaker in his preconvention dispute with 
dukakis he did not say what specific issues he wanted carter to 
negotiate with dukakis but said he was looking for meetings of 
substance about the fundamental issues 
spokesman gearan said dukakis spoke wednesday afternoon with 
jackson who has been described by aides as flabbergasted that 
dukakis did not inform him of the selection of bentsen as his 
running mate until after word of the choice had been reported in 
the news media 
it was a good friendly conversation gearan said 
later he declined to answer directly when asked if the dukakis 
campaign felt it necessary to bring in carter or any other mediator 
our campaigns have been talking throughout this process and we 
are confident they will continue to talk and that we are going to 
have a unified convention gearan said 
the dukakis campaign has said dukakis tried to personally inform 
all of the other candidates for the vice presidential nomination 
about the selection of bentsen early tuesday morning but was unable 
to reach jackson and ohio sen john glenn before the selection was 
reported 
dukakis declined to answer reporters questions outside the two 
hospitals where he visited the troopers who are recovering from 
gunshot wounds suffered wednesday night 
aides said he had already been scheduled to sign the 
drugsentencing bills thursday and decided to do so at boston city 
hospital after learning of the shootings 
were serious about a war on drugs in this state the 
governor said before he signed the bills on the hood of a state 
police cruiser were working at it 
the measures lower from 28 grams to 14 grams the amount of 
cocaine possession needed to trigger a mandatory minimum threeyear 
sentence increase the minimum sentence for possession of 28 grams 
or more to five years and set a minimum 10year sentence for 
possession of 100 or more grams of cocaine 
the laws also increase penalties for first offenders convicted 
of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute and for those 
convicted of selling the drug to minors 
back at the statehouse dukakis met with staff and legislators 
as he looked to trim as much as 200 million in spending before 
signing the states fiscal 1989 budget he also was awaiting 
legislative approval of a plan to balance the fiscal 1988 budget 
which is 370 million in the red pending approval of the plan 
aides said dukakis hoped to sign both spending plans on saturday a 
day before he heads to the convention

a palestinian believed linked to a deadly 
attack on a greek cruise ship was convicted on false passport 
charges thursday clearing the way for a us extradition request 
to be heard 
greek authorities have said the submachine gun and hand grenade 
raid on the city of poros cruise ship which killed nine people and 
injured 98 last monday may have been aimed at hijacking the vessel 
in an effort to gain mohammed rashids release from prison 
rashid 34 a selfproclaimed fighter for the palestine 
liberation organization is wanted by the united states for murder 
accused of planting a bomb aboard a pan am jumbo jet in 1982 that 
killed a japanese teenager and injured 15 people 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley said in washington 
on thursday we strongly believe that the most effective way to 
fight terrorism in this case is to expeditiously begin extradition 
proceedings against rashid 
in new developments thursday in the ship attack 
a 21yearold frenchwoman sought by greek authorities in 
connection with the attack isabelle bismuth was identified 
through dental records as being among the nine people killed 
according to informed sources in paris speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
her mother told the french press earlier her daughter was a 
secretary on vacation in greece and not a terrorist a man shown in 
a picture playing cards with ms bismuth on the ship is one of 
three men sought as attack suspects 
a danish couple who were aboard the ship two days before it was 
attacked claim to have met one of the suspected terrorists then 
the danish newspaper bt reported in its friday edition 
the report indicated the terrorists scouted the liner on an 
earlier cruise before striking the danish couple spoke on 
condition of anonymity the danish man who knows some arabic said 
21yearold mohammed zozad and two arabicspeaking friends of 
zozads stood out among the nearly 500 passengers who were mainly 
tourists from northern europe 
in the case of rashid greece says it is considering the us 
extradition request but that rashid would have to serve his greek 
sentence before he could be sent to the united states 
he began serving a sevenmonth jail sentence after a threejudge 
panel found him guilty of entering greece on a forged syrian 
passport on may 26 
he appealed the sentence but presiding judge mihalis margaritis 
ordered his continued detention at korydallos prison in nearby 
piraeus 
now that rashid has been tried on the greek charge proceedings 
can begin on the us extradition request he cannot be extradited 
before serving his full prison term 
they are trying to involve my client in these crimes he has 
no relation to these violent crimes the americans are accusing him 
of especially the recent one rashids lawyer spyros fitrakis 
told the court 
as far as the ship attack is concerned the americans are 
trying to convince people the palestinians did so that i would be 
released this is not true rashid testified 
he said his forged passport was given to him by my plo 
superiors 
i am a soldier in the palestine liberation army and a member 
of the plo rashid said 
he was arrested by police at athens airport may 30 on a tipoff 
from the us embassy 
i was passing through greece on a secret mission rashid 
told the court he would not say where he was headed 
the sweltering courtroom was packed with reporters and police 
dozens of police officers cradling automatic weapons checked people 
entering the courtroom 
police officer matthaios gonias testified that rashid was 
identified by his fingerprints and that the defendant had served 
three years of a sixyear sentence imposed in 1973 for smuggling 
just under 40 pounds of hashish into greece 
in baghdad iraq on wednesday a spokesman for plo chairman 
yasser arafat said the group condemned the ship attack 
on wednesday also in beirut lebanon a group calling itself 
the organization of the martyrs of the popular revolution of 
palestine claimed responsibility for the attack there was no way 
to independently authenticate the claim by this previously unknown 
group

a homeless advocate scaled a 767foot 
broadcast tower thursday and vowed to remain there until the 
federal government expands housing opportunities for lowincome 
americans 
wayne vorhees a volunteer with the community for creative 
nonviolence climbed the tower in northwest washington and after 
waiting for winds to subside unfurled a 50foot banner reading 
housing now 
two of his companions were arrested 
john muirhead 24 of clinton ny was apprehended after 
abandoning his attempt to join vorhees at the top of the tower 
which is owned by television station wfty and used by that station 
city police and various radio stations 
a second man harold moss was arrested after police saw him 
speaking by walkietalkie with vorhees after vorhees scaled the 
steel communications tower 
district of columbia police inspector ed spurlock said both men 
have been charged with unlawful entry the misdemeanor charge 
carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a 400 fine 
the ages and hometowns for vorhees and moss were not immediately 
available 
earlier in the day ccnv leader mitch snyder and 36 of his 
followers were arrested when they blocked traffic near the capitol 
to draw attention to the plight of the homeless during that 
protest a housing now banner was draped outside the longworth 
house office building all were charged with obstructing and 
impeding passage on government grounds police said 
the dramatic tower climb was staged in an effort to focus 
attention on americas current housing shortage moss said right 
now theres a frightening painful shortage of affordable housing 
not just in washington dc but all across america moss said 
shortly before his arrest 
its not a matter of whos in the white house moss said 
homelessness is caused more and more by a lack of housing 
moss said vorhees has enough supplies to stay on the tower for 
up to five days police said theyre considering ways to get the 
protester down but did not reveal details 
as vorhees rested on a platform atop the tower a police 
helicopter circled nearby 
figures compiled by the congressional budget office indicate 
that the department of housing of urban development budget the 
main source of federal housing assistance has been slashed 82 
percent during the reagan administration 
rental prices also are being driven up because many federally 
subsidized lowincome units have been demolished or abandoned in 
the last eight years with housing vouchers replacing maintenance 
of these structures 
a recent harvard university study indicates that there are now 
about 1 million more poor households than there are available 
lowincome housing units

nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann faced 
with a us order to leave the country accused the reagan 
administration thursday of violating the organization of american 
states charter but he won little more than a polite hearing from 
his oas colleagues 
tunnermann left unclear whether he will abide by the expulsion 
order saying he will make his position clear at noon friday a few 
hours before the deadline for his departure from us territory 
after a meeting of the oas permanent council that lasted just 
under two hours the only expression of support tunnermann could 
claim was a statement by mexican ambassador antonio de icaza 
icaza who spoke in the name of seven other governments noted 
that oas provisions ensure that the 32 member states have the right 
to attend meetings of the organization independent of their 
bilateral relations with the host government underscoring the 
right of all to full representation in the organization 
but icaza also said that these rights are inadeqautely protected 
under a 1975 agreement governing us obligations as the host 
country for the oas as a consequence he said it is 
necessary to fill this legal vacuum 
the majority of the delegates sat impassively through the 
session apparently preferring to stay aloof from the latest 
chapter in the sevenyear history of acrimony between the united 
states and nicaragua 
much of the meeting was taken up by a heated exchange between 
the us and nicaraguan delegates with each accusing the other of 
prolonging the conflict in nicaragua 
tunnermann stopped short of asking for a formal endorsement of 
his position pointing out that he had requested the thursday 
meeting only to inform fellow delegates of his position 
the reagan administration on tuesday ordered tunnermann and 
seven colleagues to leave the country within 72 hours a day after 
nicaragua expelled eight american diplomats from managua including 
us ambassador richard melton 
the administration said the action was taken for retaliatory 
purposes and in the case of tunnermann and military attache major 
pedro sampson for violations of their privileges of residence in 
the united states 
the us ambassador to the oas richard maccormack told the 
delegates that tunnermann and sampson had engaged in certain 
activities which the united states found objectionable but he 
declined to spell them out 
he said the administration had deferred expelling tunnermann and 
sampson earlier in order to avoid giving the nicaragua government 
a pretext for taking the kinds of actions it perpetrated this 
week 
he added that the explusion of the american diplomats from 
managua removed the basis for such restraint on the part of the 
united states 
the reagan administration has said it expects tunnermann and his 
colleagues to comply with the expulsion order but the envoy was 
noncommittal when asked by reporters about his plans 
president reagan said tunnermann will have a big surprise 
awaiting him if the envoy decides to ignore the us demand 
tunnermann who serves as both ambassador to the united states 
and the oas said his government has considered taking his case 
against the administration to us courts 
his main defense was that the united states has no right to 
refuse accreditation to envoys sent to washington by oas member 
states 
it is a sovereign decision of our states that the host 
country must respect to designate its representation before the 
permanent council he said

a lebanese gunman inside the libyan 
embassy held off police for nearly 12 hours thursday before he fell 
asleep and authorities rushed him officials said no shots were 
fired and no one was injured 
police identified the arrested man as elibrahim edelbi 22 he 
had pulled out a revolver thursday morning after embassy personnel 
refused to grant him a visa to travel to libya authorities said 
edelbi escaped from a prison in goettingen on july 8 with a 
turkish inmate who has since been recaptured authorities said 
edelbi was serving a threeyear prison term for assault and had 
been at the prison for 18 months 
police said edelbi told officers he had eaten nothing since he 
escaped 
he had become very weak since his escape and looked exhausted 
during the negotiations with authorities said ulrich fischer 
head of the bonn police team that captured edelbi 
fischers team watched edelbi through a video camera that is a 
normal part of security on the first floor of the libyan embassy 
at about 915 pm 315 pm edt police noticed edelbi had 
fallen asleep inside the firstfloor visitors room and they 
rushed into the building fischer said 
finally he just fell asleep from exhaustion said fischer 
he did not offer us any resistance 
police said there were no injuries among several embassy workers 
who had been trapped on upper floors since the siege began early 
thursday and that no shots were fired 
police said they did not know where edelbi obtained his gun 
edelbi was taken to a local hospital for examination officials

distance of about three yards to avoid being grabbed by police 
officers on the other side of the metal gate police spokesman hans 
georg classen said 
classen said bonn police did not know how long edelbi had lived 
in west germany whether he had relatives in this country or any 
other details about him other than his prison record 
classen said a number of embassy employees had been on floors 
above the gunman who was alone on the ground floor of the 
fivestory building but he did not know how many workers had been 
in the building 
they could not leave because the gunman controlled access to 
stairways and doors

wearing combat gear climbed through a secondstory window into the 
embassy known as the libyan peoples bureau 
omar k bukhries head of the embassy had given police

jesse jackson accepted an apology thursday from a 
michael dukakis aide over the handling of the no 2 spot on the 
democratic ticket and asked former president carter to mediate 
tensions between the two camps 
jackson sounded a conciliatory note after the call from paul 
brountas dukakis campaign chairman who offered an apology and 
detailed a series of mistakes that led to a delay in jacksons 
being told that texas sen lloyd bentsen had been selected dukakis 
running mate 
we accept that explanation jackson said at a news 
conference before leaving on a threeday bus caravan to the 
national convention in atlanta 
asked about carters response to his request jackson said he 
wants to serve in any way he can 
dukakis campaign manager susan estrich said she knew nothing 
about the proposal later campaign spokesman mark gearan asked 
whether the dukakis forces believed a mediator was needed said 
our campaigns have been talking throughout this process and we 
are confident they will continue to talk and that we are going to 
have a unified convention 
dukakis himself did not apologize during a telephone call 
wednesday but jackson said he did not ask for and would not seek 
a personal apology 
jackson learned of dukakis selection of bentsen from reporters 
as he arrived in washington tuesday morning he received a call 
from dukakis about an hour later and before the public announcement 
that afternoon 
dukakis said wednesday he tried unsuccessfully to reach jackson 
but word got out 
dukakis plans for a show of unity have been clouded by 
jacksons hints that he might challenge the selection of the texas 
senator jackson supporters have threatened protests and some 
dukakis backers also criticized the treatment of jackson by the 
dukakis camp 
sen bill bradley dnj a prominent dukakis supporter once 
viewed as a possible running mate to the massachusetts governor 
said dukakis blundered in not notifying jackson earlier that he 
wouldnt be on the ticket 
and new york gov mario cuomo a prominent democrat said 
dukakis is not required to anything for jesse but added i 
think if he wants to win he should 
at the news conference jackson insisted we will exercise all 
our rights during the convention next week and said its still an 
open question whether he will allow his name to be entered in 
nomination for vice president 
it is an open convention we have not yet made a decision 
about all the strategies we will employ he said 
despite those statements jackson sent generally conciliatory 
signals to the dukakis camp saying the issue for my constituency 
is not about the time of a call 
i simply want the respect and responsibility said jackson 
who emphasized that he wants meetings of substance between now 
and then about the fundamental issues 
later after his bus caravan arrived in indianapolis jackson 
said were not going to give up on communications with the 
dukakis camp he said he expected the two would meet at some 
appropriate time 
we hope in the next three or four days that matters will be 
resolved he said at his news conference in indianapolis 
earlier jackson said he has not set all of his strategies for 
next week but wants carter to play a real role in mediating 
between the two camps he telephoned the former president thursday 
to ask his help 
he understands the equation said jackson who added that 
carter has earned the respect of all of us 
then at that time well look at the next step of our 
challenge said jackson who plans to meet with top advisers to 
discuss convention rules and determine the best steps for next week 
jacksons reaction will be key at convention next week and on 
thursday he displayed both hurt feelings about his treatment during 
the bentsen selection and determination to continue talks with 
dukakis forces 
inclusion is the watchword jackson said we want 
inclusion in the party at every level 
as we seek to resolve the creative tensions within our party 
we are determined to set and keep a moral tone that excludes 
battles over personal issues he said 
jackson said he hopes his forces came resume the stalled 
negotiations with the dukakis camp on the party platform but said 
his backers will be debating minority planks at the convention 
he said negotiations with dukakis must be built based on 
shared power and shared responsibility 
asked about other issues he might want to settle with dukakis 
jackson insisted his fundamental role as a force in the party was 
in question because at this point were disconnected from the 
process 
after the the stop in indianapolis the bus caravan will travel 
to louisville ky nashville tenn chattanooga tenn and 
finally atlanta

banks raised the prime lending rate to the 
highest level in more than two years thursday reflecting a rise in 
their own borrowing costs and signaling more expensive loans for 
consumers and businesses 
the move from 9 percent to 95 percent marked the second time 
this year the nations banks have raised the prime a key rate used 
to calculate a range of fixed and adjustablerate corporate and 
consumer loans 
chase manhattan bank in new york was the first to announce the 
rate increase and others quickly matched it putting the prime at 
the highest point since march 1986 
economists had been expecting such a move because of evidence 
that the federal reserve has tightened credit over the past few 
months through its control of the amount of money in the banking 
system this control is one of the feds principal weapons to 
forestall higher inflation 
the rate increase came one day after the central banks 
chairman alan greenspan told congress in his twiceannual report 
that the fed had been tightening and that holding down inflation 
remained his key priority some economists saw a significant 
connection between his remarks and the banks action 
this is one of the few times the fed really has to say 
publicly what its going to do so we wanted to see that said 
john oliver wilson chief economist at bank of america in san 
francisco the prime would have gone up no matter what he said 
but it was a question of how much 
m kathryn eickhoff president of the eickhoff economics 
consulting firm and a former policy director in the office of 
management and budget said the increase in the prime was 
relatively moderate reflecting confidence in greenspans 
prediction that interest rates would not rise dramatically this 
year 
others said the prime rate increase had little or nothing to do 
with greenspans remarks and merely compensated for the rising 
costs of borrowing that banks have been facing 
these costs have narrowed the difference between what banks pay 
for money in the credit markets and what they charge to lend it 
known as he spread which is how banks make their profit 
an important indicator of bank costs is the federal funds rate 
the interest on overnight loans between banks the rate has been 
nudging upward toward 8 percent compared with about 7 percent a 
few months ago 
although many economists have said interest rates will not rise 
much further before the november election a few predicted more 
prime rate increases into doubledigit territory in the months 
ahead possibly by the end of summer if the banks cost of 
borrowing keeps rising 
overall this is just one more piece of ammuniion to show that 
interest rates are headed up said william veronda portfolio 
strategist and credit market economist at financial programs inc 
a denver investment firm

the governing conservative party retained the west 
london district of kensington in polling thursday in the first 
special parliamentary election of prime minister margaret 
thatchers third term but saw its winning margin sharply cut 
voters in the polarized district where royal palaces and 
highrise tenements crowd into three square miles reelected the 
conservatives with 9829 votes against 9014 for the secondplaced 
socialist opposition labor party 
this represented a winning margin for the conservatives over 
labor of 815 votes at the general election in june 1987 the 
conservatives winning margin over labor in the 48500voter 
district was 4500 
bookmakers favored the conservatives to win but many political 
commentators considered labor had a good chance of victory and 
bryan gould labors trade and industry spokesman described the 
kensington result announced early friday as a bitter disappointment 
for his party 
the campaign in kensington which contains thousands of highly 
transient apartmentdwellers was dull and only 51 percent of 
eligible voters bothered to cast their ballots 
the conservatives dudley fishburn 42 an eton and 
harvardeducated former senior editor on the respected weekly the 
economist was put on the defensive during a lackluster campaign by 
thatcher plans for an unpopular new property tax 
but labors ann holmes 41 had to campaign against a background 
of disarray in the british socialist movement over its 
controversial antinuclear policy 
william goodhart 55 of the social and liberal democratic 
party came third with 2546 votes businessman john martin 52 of 
the social democratic party came fourth with 1190 votes 
the kensington poll was the first parliamentary test where 
britains two centrist parties paid the price for an acrimonious 
merger last spring of their former electoral alliance 
both the merged party the social and liberal democratic party 
and the breakaway social democratic party ran candidates thus 
splitting the already minority centrist vote 
the election was caused by the death last november of 
conservative legislator sir brandon rhys williams who represented 
kensington for 20 years 
the districts plush southern end encompasses some of the most 
beautiful parts of the british capital rows of elegant period 
houses kensington gardens and the palace where heir to the throne 
prince charles his aunt princess margaret and cousin prince 
michael live in vast apartments 
in north kensington workingclass britons and immigrants live 
in shabby streets 
at the last general election which gave mrs thatcher a third 
consecutive victory the conservatives took 423 percent of the 
vote labor 308 and the centrist alliance 225 percent 
since the election she has pursued a radical program including 
a shakeup of the welfare system and education and the new property 
tax which is aimed at undermining labor councils but will more 
than double some household tax bills 
the conservatives have a huge 101seat majority in the 
650member house of commons the conservatives have 375 seats 
labor 229 the social and liberal democrats 19 and the breakaway 
sdp 3 the rest are held by minority regional parties

a jury began deliberations thursday in 
the case of three white lawmen accused of beating a black inmate to 
death 
the three officers former hemphill police chief thomas ladner 
41 and sabine county sheriffs deputies james bo hyden 35 
and bill horton 58 have denied they delivered the blows that led 
to the death of loyal garner jr a black truck driver from 
florien la 
the three are accused of violating garners civil rights if 
convicted they face up to life in prison 
after deliberating about six hours the jurors were ordered 
sequestered for the night and were to resume their work friday 
garner 34 died dec 27 at a tyler hospital two days after 
allegedly being beaten while in the sabine county jail in hemphill 
the issue in this case is whether loyal garner was beaten 
unlawfully and then was left to lie in his own blood prosecutor 
john hannah said in final arguments to the jury thursday 
hannah accused the three of conspiring to cover up the beating 
by concocting a story that garner was a drug dealer and was 
extremely drunk when he was jailed 
they knew they had seriously screwed up what they had to do 
was build up a defense that the man they killed was a dope 
dealer he said 
defense attorneys in their closing arguments challenged the 
credibility of some of the states witnesses saying many were 
inmates who were in the jail at the time and had long criminal 
records 
the question of whether anybody had been beaten depends on 
credibility said john seale ladners attorney why suddenly 
have these three leopards changed their spots and suddenly become 
crooked conniving and dirty men these three men did not get 
together and make up anything 
seale also said ladner was justified in striking garner with a 
slapstick once during a jail scuffle christmas night 
all three officers took the stand wednesday as testimony in the 
twoweek trial ended all denied causing garners death 
if the jury convicts any of the three the defendants have 
agreed to allow state district judge oneal bacon to determine 
punishment 
the three also have been charged with murder in garners death 
and that trial is scheduled to begin monday in tyler

of a 471 million aid package introduced in the senate for the 
nicaraguan contra rebels despite some problems with the fine 
print 
the outline of the package including 20 million in military 
aid and 271 million in humanitarian aid through next march was 
introduced late wednesday by senate republican leader bob dole of 
kansas 
he offered it as a freestanding measure but it will be slated 
for action as an amendment to an appropriations bill dole aide 
walt riker said thursday 
under the measure aid to the rebels opposing nicaraguas 
leftist sandinista government would be authorized only after the 
president certifies that it is necessary and after both houses of 
congress approve it 
asked about white house involvement in the creation of the 
package riker said weve been in consultation with them but 
weve taken the lead on it 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said thursday that the 
white house was working with congress on a new contra aid bill and 
said dole has been very helpful in this effort 
we may not agree with all the fine print in the bill but we 
think its a very productive bill fitzwater said as he flew with 
president reagan from washington to marion ill for a oneday 
trip to see droughtravaged farmland in the midwest and to offer 
moral support for farmers there 
when reagan was asked wednesday whether he was supporting 
efforts to get a new contra aid package through congress he 
responded you bet i am 
fitzwaters comments came the same day the house voted 38518 to 
condemn the sandinista government for brutal suppression of basic 
human rights 
the house action was similar to one approved by the senate 914 
on wednesday except that the senate version threatened the 
possible renewal of military aid to the contras 
anger in congress was triggered by the sandinista governments 
arrests of more than 40 people including opposition leaders and 
the closing down of the opposition newspaper la prensa and a roman 
catholic radio station in addition nicaragua this week expelled 
eight us diplomats including ambassador richard melton an 
action that prompted the reagan administration to order the 
expulsion of eight nicaraguan diplomats including ambassador 
carlos tunnermann 
obviously nicaraguan president daniel ortega has given us a 
real gift to rally support for the freedom fighters riker said 
theres a real chance now to get contra aid again theres going 
to be some democratic support weve talked to some of the 
democrats already 
in february congress rejected a 362 million package which 
included a proposed 35 million for a military escrow account 
in late march it approved a 48 million measure providing only 
humanitarian aid for nicaragua through sept 30 and only 17 
million of that was earmarked for the contras

expected even though the early stages of the probe helped uncover

duke ellington was such a prolific composer and 
profound influence on american music that it takes the pbs series 
american masters two installments to tell his story 
the first half of producerdirector terry carters vivid 
portrayal a duke named ellington airs monday night on the 
public broadcasting service the second half can be seen next 
monday july 25 
the documentary includes rare performance footage from europe 
never before seen in the united states and interviews with many of 
the musicians who played in ellingtons band which stayed together 
for a record 47 years 
ellington who died in 1974 began his career in harlem he says 
in interview footage that there was a lot of tough competition from 
the many pianists on the busy music scene guys like count basie 
willie the lion smith and james p johnson 
but im lucky ellington says everybody liked me 
suave handsome and charismatic ellington was also a shrewd 
businessman who entered into a productive partnership with music 
publisher irving mills it was mills who was instrumental in 
getting ellington a gig at the cotton club the documentary 
includes tape of an announcer introducing ellington as the 
greatest living master of jungle music 
ellingtons association with mills according to ellington 
helped break down racial barriers in the music industry and at a 
time when blacks were being insulted by hollywood stereotypes 
ellington and the band appeared in their first movie in 1930 
check and double check ellingtons cool sophisticated style 
gave black americans a positive selfimage 
it seems he was as charismatic to his musicians as he was to his 
fans 
i consider myself privileged to sit in duke ellingtons band 
for 28 years says russell procope any musician you talk to 
whether white black grizzled or gray wanted to play with duke 
ellingtons band believe me 
in 1943 ellington hired clarinetist jimmy hamilton whose 
smooth benny goodmanish sound was a departure from the new 
orleansstyle jazz that was prevalent among black musicians in an 
interview hamilton recalls his reluctance at joining ellingtons 
band because he was working well enough and didnt want to go on 
the road 
he also recalls with relish how he would practice constantly to 
keep up with ellingtons increasingly complex compositions 
he put some music up and id say hey thats difficult man 
i dont know if i can make that you were always trying to stay a 
little ahead of him because he was going to try to get you sooner 
or later 
hamilton said he managed the piece quite well and ellington 
took the same music to goodman who without benefit of practice 
didnt do such a good job ellington came back gloating according 
to hamilton and said ah i found out bennys human 
ellingtons relationship with sax player johnny hodges was not 
so genial according to critic leonard feather hodges riffs would 
sometimes get turned into compositions by ellington and hodges 
felt he was due some proceeds when ellington would play the piece 
said feather johnny would start making motions with his hands 
like counting money you know and that went on actually on the 
bandstand 
part 2 which follows ellingtons later career opens with 
ellington and the band playing the classic take the a train 
which in fact was written by collaborator billy strayhorn 
that number is followed by another classic mood indigo 
i think we played that every night for 28 years said 
procope i never got tired of it because every night it was like 
the first time 
in an interview ellington is asked about his relationship to 
his people the people he responds thats the better 
word the people rather than my people becuase the people are my 
people

despite foreboding bus czar fred g currey and 
his investor groups sank millions last year into rebuilding the 
declining bus industry over the long haul 
they bought greyhound lines in march 1987 and few months later 
acquired trailways inc forming the largest intercity bus company 
in the nation 
now the merger has received the blessing of the interstate 
commerce commission and the bus lines boast increased ridership 
after five years of decline 
we know there are some things wrong with the system but 
were dedicated to bringing the system back said currey a 
former trailways director 
but curreys venture to make the bus a formidable transportation 
force hasnt been a smooth ride so far he relates it as a good 
news bad news story 
after slashing fares as much as 50 percent and unleashing the 
biggest advertising blitz in years by either bus line greyhounds 
ridership surged 
the bad news is the bus company wasnt prepared currey said 
terminals were packed ticket lines were long luggage and 
packages were lost and buses were delayed 
we had a lot of service deficiencies and we had them because 
we were putting together the two largest bus companies in the 
nation he said 
although he is optimistic the company can overcome its problems 
currey acknowledges the only way the bus can make a comeback is by 
improving longdeteriorating quality 
his plans to refuel the bus lines include faster ticketing 
refurbished and secure terminals computerized routing 
airlinecompetitive prices and allaround upgraded service 
we have a fundamental belief in the viability of the business 
and that really is in sharp contrast with the attitude that the 
previous owners had about the industry and the business currey 
said 
gli holding co inc an investor group led by currey acquired 
greyhound lines for 350 million the acquisition occurred amid 
declining ridership and labor disputes between union members and 
phoenixbased greyhound corp 
trailways inc was on the brink of collapse when another currey 
group gli acquisition inc spent 80 million to buy some of its 
fleet garages and terminals in july 1987 
despite icc misgivings that merging the two companies could 
violate antitrust laws the buyouts were given temporary approval 
and on may 17 the merger was endorsed 
a company like greyhound faces significant competition said 
michael redisch chief of research and analysis in the iccs office 
of transportation analysis 
buses are the peoples last choice if the airline wont go 
there and its too far to drive the bus is the last choice the 
bus is also hurt by driving and the growth of the automobile 
redisch said 
its a hard way to make a living 
dont tell that to currey hes operating on the premise that 
the bus and its workers are just suffering from neglect 
the previous owners of greyhound and even to a modest extent 
trailways had kind of a goingoutofbusiness attitude that was 
conveyed to the marketplace said craig lentzsch greyhound lines 
vice chairman and executive vice president so our coming on 
board and saying were here for the long pull i think had a 
positive effect on the marketplace 
in 1987 greyhound lines which runs buses under the 
recognizable trailways name but stamps them with the running 
greyhound logo logged 63 billion passenger miles up from 61 
billion in 1986 icc statistics show passenger miles are the total 
number of miles ridden by paying passengers 
greyhound predicts a 24 percent increase in passenger miles in 
1988 said company spokesman george gravley 
from march 19 1987 to dec 31 1987 the company lost 274 
million gravley said 
we got the revenues we expected and the profit was somewhat 
lower than anticipated because we incurred such substantial 
increased costs in consolidation currey said 
although the company faces 326 million in longterm debt the 
sale of 150 million in senior notes has allowed it to retire some 
shortterm bank debts with higher interest payments and to pour 
about 65 million into sorely needed bus purchases 
in an october company newsletter jim malcomb senior vice 
president of maintenance said 387 of trailways 1127 buses would 
not run 85 needed engines that were not in stock and many more 
were parked because of deferred maintenance 
since its purchase the company has added 325 new buses 275 
mci buses purchased from a subsidiary of greyhound corp and 50 
from eagle international inc a greyhound lines subsidiary 
the bus line subscribes to an airline computer reservation 
system sabre and uses it to compete with airline prices 
we simply cannot survive in this business with the poor 
quality we provided many of our customers this past summer 
currey told employees in the october newsletter 
after the chaotic summer currey directed executives to ask 
employees what they would do to fix the companys shortcomings 
as a result computers have been installed at greyhound 
telephone centers replacing complicated and often incorrect 
schedule reading gravley said 
by july 15 the company expects to have new systems that will 
spit out a ticket in 30 seconds in 100 of the nations largest bus 
terminals 
many depots including dallas are being remodeled expanded or 
moved a onestory schoolhouse in evansville ind is being 
restored to historical standards to serve as a bus terminal 
the business is alive and well currey said at a recent 
employee meeting in dallas and we as outstanding people have 
within our grasp if we act as a team the best transportation 
company in america

robe moslem women wear 
in the locker room she shed the robe to reveal the latest in 
latex exercise gear within minutes she was gyrating to the 
pounding beat of the aerobics class music 
physical fitness is a sensitive subject in the arab world where 
religion and custom decree that womens bodies and sometimes their 
faces be covered 
even in the relatively westernized arab states on the persian 
gulf many women young and old adhere to tradition walking the 
streets in their abayas 
but the female fitness craze has arrived and among gulf women 
it is just beginning to hit its stride 
in another manama gym a young girl in red stretch jogging pants 
and a tshirt reading bye bye worry is one of 33 arab women 
all physical fitness instructors taking a training seminar 
the women 19 to 34 years old have been training for two years 
and now teach their own community courses currently drawing about 
1300 women 
kathy james an american sports specialist and guest instructor 
for the seminar sponsored by the us information service and the 
bahrain sports institute says she was surprised to find such an 
active group in the arab world 
i think theyre becoming more aware of how important it is to 
keep your body physically fit she said 
medical experts say oil wealth and other factors beginning in 
the 1970s have helped bring about changes in eating habits 
saturated fats refined sugars and processed foods have become part 
of the diet and people are adopting a luxuryloving more sedentary 
lifestyle 
its overindulgence said dr essa amin chief of the 
medical staff at bahrains defense force hospital 
theres definitely a link between the diet habit the lack of 
exercise and higher incidence of diabetes cardiac and 
cardiocirculatory problems 
interest in fitness has been encouraged by european and other 
expatriate women who bring a more active sportsoriented lifestyle 
to the region 
apart from those operated at major hotels bahrain now has about 
15 womens fitness centers in schools gymnasiums and private 
health clubs and health studios also operate in nearby dubai and 
abu dhabi 
in cairo egypt aerobics instructor samia allouba has kept her 
popular television show going despite islamic fundamentalist 
opposition that she says has included telephone threats and 
street taunts from both men and women 
she compromises by wearing discreet highcollared tops with 
long sleeves during her tv presentations 
but having crusaded for female fitness for eight years she now 
thinks shes winning egyptian as well as foreign women fill her 
suburban cairo studio from morning to night 
in the last two years ive noticed a definite change in the 
attitudes of women she said in a telephone interview theyve 
become more interested in becoming healthy 
odette alagasi aerobics instructor at bahrains gulf hotel 
said that when she arrived from the philippines more than a year 
ago virtually all her students were foreign women now at least 
onefourth are local 
alagasi 24 said most of her students enroll to lose weight and 
arent aware of such things as the cardiovascular benefits of 
exercise 
mona alansari 29 who has trained the 33 aerobics and fitness 
instructors for the bahrain governments council for youth and 
sports says arab women naturally shy are more at ease in being 
taught by another arab 
we understand their special needs they trust us to do 
their classes for them she said before they didnt have the 
chance to do anything like this for themselves now the opportunity 
is there 
wives mothers and girls women from 12 to 60 years old are 
coming to classes and i like to encourage the women to do sports 
to be on a level with the men 
the advocates of exercise say they see is no conflict with the 
teachings of islam 
instructor alansari quotes the prophet mohammed as saying 
the strong moslem is better than the weak moslem

cardinal john oconnor mayor edward koch and 
several hundred other pilgrims head off this week on a peace 
mission to ireland hoping prayer can succeed where 800 years of 
violence have failed 
i think prayer is an area thats been totally neglected as a 
possible key to peace with justice and i think maybe our doing 
this will catch on oconnor said last week i believe in the 
tremendous power of prayer 
that power will be tested mightily in northern ireland where 
more than 2600 people have been killed in the two decades since 
the irish republican army revived its war against british rule 
this is a land where even a pilgrimage for peace and justice can 
accentuate divisions if peace means the status quo the ira would 
rather fight if justice means change many protestants would do 
the same 
oconnor called for the pilgrimage on st patricks day after a 
protestant gunman killed three mourners and wounded 68 others at 
the belfast funeral of three ira members 
the idea came to him the cardinal said as he was speaking from 
the altar of st patricks cathedral in an emotional sermon 
oconnor bemoaned the lack of concern for northern irelands 
troubles by americans 40 million of whom trace their roots to the 
island 
have we forgotten the very existence of ireland and the 
horrors that have been perpetrated there for so many years he 
asked 
the cardinal said he hoped 100000 pilgrims would follow him 
but possibly because people already had made their summer vacation 
plans or because they are bewildered and frustrated by ulsters 
seemingly intractable problems fewer than 1000 signed up 
they include city council president peter vallone former gov 
hugh carey and steven mcdonald a new york city policeman who was 
paralyzed when he was shot in the line of duty two years ago 
they depart thursday and arrive the next day in knock a town in 
the west of the irish republic where catholics believe mary mother 
of jesus appeared in 1879 
after three days of masses and other services at the shrine 
there the group will spend several days in dublin with a side 
trip across the border into northern ireland oconnor will say 
mass in armagh with cardinal tomas o fiaich after a brief visit on 
his own to belfast 
since becoming archbishop of new york in 1984 oconnor has 
emerged as the us churchs leading spokesman on northern ireland 
and one of the few american bishops ever to show much interest in 
its troubles 
the american catholic hierarchy is dominated by irishamericans 
but other issues such as arms control and other places such as 
central america invariably get the attention 
where are the social activists especially our priests and 
nuns who condemn oppression in the third world but are silent 
about suffering in ireland oconnor demanded on st patricks 
day 
although the cardinal has consistently denounced violence he 
also has criticized british tactics and policies he visited joe 
doherty an ira member accused of murder in jail in new york he 
publicly embraced peter king an ira supporter who was elected 
grand marshal of the 1985 st patricks parade 
with his lips he condemns terror editorialized the daily 
mail of london with his hand he slaps it on the back 
but his defenders say oconnor treats ira members much as he 
does catholics who disobey church teaching on birth control or 
abortion he condemns the sin but not the sinner 
oconnors tenure in new york has been marked by almost as much 
controversy as kochs and some observers are worried the pair will 
exacerbate tensions in a land where almost anything anybody says 
offends somebody 
koch says the pilgrimage is so important he will skip the 
democratic national convention but the mayor whose strident 
rhetoric upstaged the candidates themselves in new yorks 
democratic primary is regarded warily by the british the ira and 
protestant paramilitary groups all of whom he has criticized 
i think he can help but i hope hell be careful not to pick a 
fight said charles j hynes a state special prosecutor and 
organizer of new yorks irishamerican unity day 
in interviews prominent irishamerican ira supporters endorsed 
the trip while ira critics questioned its value 
i would not cast doubt on the power of prayer said martin 
galvin of irish northern aid which has raised millions of dollars 
for the ira effort peter king said the pilgrimage has to do 
good just by going the cardinal sends a message that hes 
concerned 
but padraig omalley of the university of massachusetts at 
boston an expert on irish politics voiced the consensus on the 
other side of the issue i dont think this trip will be 
particularly helpful or useful 
oconnor he said would have been better advised to organize a 
clearly interdenominational group and share the leadership with 
episcopal and presbyterian clergy 
in northern ireland omalley said one must be sensitive to 
symbolism and the symbolism of this trip is all wrong oconnor 
he said will be seen as the representative of one tradition 
even catholics are unlikely to be greatly encouraged by 
oconnors visit he said thereve been far too many americans 
on far too many trips through far too many calls for peace even 
the pope got on bended knee and asked for peace in 1979 everyone 
praised him and then went back to their ways

willie kasayulie was 13 when he had to 
leave this eskimo fishing village it had no high school and 
bright kids like willie were sent to distant boarding schools 
far from family and home he polished his english learned to 
deal with ignorance about his culture and realized the depth of his 
love for the land and his people 
at 37 willie kasayulie is back home putting the lessons of his 
teenage years to use as chief of the yupiit nation he leads a 
coalition of 19 yupik eskimo villages in a battle with state and 
federal officials over control of the villages destiny 
when congress settled alaska natives land claims in 1971 it 
tried to avoid the social ills endured by american indians in the 
lower 48 states instead of reservations run by tribal councils it 
set up corporations run by native shareholders but now kasayulie 
and other native leaders disappointed by the corporations 
performance say the tribal way looks better all the time 
their efforts to assert tribal sovereignty are opposed by state 
and federal officials who fear that recognition of distinct tribes 
in alaska could split the state into an unmanageable hodgepodge of 
independent enclaves 
but kasayulie also a commercial fisherman says that denying 
tribal status is denying a culture its right to govern itself by 
its traditions 
theyre trying to take away my cultural rights said 
kasayulie i dont want to forget who i am or where my roots are 
weve got our language our history and those are as important as 
the history of the united states 
akiachak population 470 tucked among willows on an oxbow turn 
of the muddy kuskokwim river in southwestern alaska can be reached 
only by boat or airplane in summer by dog team or snowmobile in 
winter 
despite its isolation akiachak is at the center of a movement 
among rural alaska natives to assert tribal control over education 
law enforcement taxation game regulations and other governmental 
functions 
the struggle is waged in legislative halls courtrooms and the 
native villages themselves 
akiachak residents voted in 1983 to replace their municipal 
government with a tribal council the council now runs the 
villages water treatment plant pays the salaries of three police 
officers and levies a 2 percent sales tax a panel of elders metes 
out fines for minor crimes in the village but the state recognizes 
neither council nor panel as legitimate governing bodies 
the athabascan indian village of copper center announced its 
intention to tax the operators of the transalaska oil pipeline 
which passes through traditional hunting grounds near the village 
the case is pending in federal district court 
a nonnative family expelled by tyoneks tribal council sued 
the village a federal district court upheld the villages 
sovereign immunity against such suits an appeal is pending 
congress thought it was heading off such conflicts when it 
passed the alaska native claims settlement act in 1971 hailed as 
the most generous settlement ever struck with native americans the 
act granted alaskas natives 963 million and 44 million acres in 
exchange for dropping aboriginal land claims 
the land and money were put under control of 12 regional 
corporations and 200 village corporations 
congress said in ancsa look the days of reservations are 
over we want you to be good businessmen and be part of the 
american economic mainstream said thomas morehouse a 
researcher at the university of alaskas institute for social and 
economic research 
the laws boosters said the corporations would make money for 
alaskas 70000 eskimos aleuts and indians help develop the 
states resources and assimilate natives into modern society while 
addressing social problems such as alcoholism and suicide 
in general the corporations have failed to live up to those 
grand expectations 
some have thrived investing wisely and developing resources 
such as timber or minerals others have foundered the regional 
bering straits native corp is in bankruptcy court and many do no 
more than fill out annual reports 
but even successful corporations have paid out few dividends 
alaska natives have received an average of only 800 in dividends 
since 1971 said janie leask president of the alaska federation of 
natives

despite ancsa and its millions native people who had little 
money before 1971 have little money today said thomas berger a 
former british columbia supreme court judge who spent two years 
interviewing villagers across alaska for the inuit circumpolar 
conference 
unemployment remains high in alaskas villages alcoholism is 
widespread as liquor fuels the depression of a younger generation 
skilled in neither the old subsistence traditions nor the modern 
ways of a technological society alaskas young native men aged 14 
to 24 kill themselves at a rate four times the national average a 
recent study found 
disappointment in the corporate experiment turned to outrage 
when it became obvious it could eventually lead to the loss of 
native lands ancsa banned the sale of stock to nonnatives until 
1991 but natives realized their corporations would be diluted and 
their land could slip from their grasp after that 
the yupiit nation was born in this atmosphere of fear in the 
summer of 1984 kasayulie and about 40 other native leaders drew up 
a declaration of independence from outside forces 
our people have been in control for so many thousands of 
years determining their own destiny with the advance of western 
society the rules changed he said 
native sovereignty is a way to change the rules back again he 
said 
for example akiachaks panel of elders may confiscate a mans 
riverboat if they find him guilty of disturbing the peace if he 
needs it for fishing to feed his family theyre likely to return 
it kasayulie said 
tribal council meetings are conducted in yupik the language of 
choice for most villagers and great deference is paid to the 
elders kasayulie said 
akiachaks brightest teenagers can stay in the village these 
days attending a modern high school that features both computer 
labs and lessons on building dog sleds 
but akiachaks tribal government is still underground as far as 
state officials are concerned the state wont budge on most tribal 
issues partly because sovereignty would discriminate against 
whites living in predominantly native villages said douglas mertz 
an assistant state attorney general 
nonnatives would not have the right to participate in the 
government he said they wouldnt have effective recourse if 
their civil rights were violated in fact they could be booted out 
of the community even if they owned property and had lived there 
all their lives 
state officials also worry that if each of alaskas 200 native 
villages sets up a separate jurisdiction the result would be a 
jumble of tax environmental and hunting and fishing regulations 
mertz is juggling a halfdozen cases involving tribal 
sovereignty and he expects to see more 
thats because the courts have inherited the question from 
congress which last winter amended the claims settlement act the 
amendments continued the restrictions on stock ownership 
indefinitely relieving some of the natives concerns but 
lawmakers rejected pleas to include language bolstering sovereignty 
claims 
so far the courts have sent mixed signals concerning 
sovereignty 
tribal advocates applauded the federal district courts 1986 
decision upholding tyoneks immunity 
but the sovereignty movement was dealt a blow in may when the 
alaska supreme court said tyonek was an exception because it 
occupied a reservation later dissolved in the 1930s the court 
said other alaska villages are ineligible to claim sovereign 
immunity because congress never treated them as reservations or 
tribes 
mertz said it would take more than one court case to untangle 
the legal thicket surrounding native sovereignty the one thing 
about indian law is that there are no certainties and indian law 
in alaska is even more that way he said 
akiachak is not waiting for final word from the courts perhaps 
the best argument for tribal sovereignty kasayulie said is that 
it works 
if theres to be any dispute from the state or federal 
government let them prove that our tribal governments arent 
functioning he said 
i think they should make a comparison between tribal 
government and city government to find out who is more responsible 
to the villagers i think theyd find the tribal government is 
operating better than the city even though were operating with 
less money

rein and sirje ruutsoo are estonias 
version of the children of the 1960s they wanted to take on the 
establishment but this was the soviet union 
they had hopes for a revival of estonian culture and political 
power during the liberalization drive of nikita s khrushchev after 
years of stalinism but khrushchev was ousted in 1964 and leonid i 
brezhnev rose to kremlin leadership and any hopes the ruutsoos had 
were quickly dashed 
now with mikhail s gorbachev leading the nation and opening up 
a closed society the ruutsoos are speaking their minds 
so are many of their fellow estonians and people living in the 
two neighboring soviet republics on the baltic sea latvia and 
lithuania 
they want officials in moscow to keep their hands off the 
culture language and economy of the baltic states home for 77 
million people 
by allowing the soviet unions many nationalities to vent long 
pentup demands gorbachev may gain popular support in estonia and 
other independentminded republics 
estonia with a 15 million population is already among the 
most westernized of the 15 soviet republics 
along with latvia and lithuania estonia had a brief taste of 
independence 22 years between the two world wars and still 
feels some kinship with the finns who live just 50 miles across the 
gulf of finland and whose language is akin to estonian 
but estonians lithuanians and latvians have lived under the 
influence or domination of others since the 13th century starting 
with the german teutonic order then came the swedes followed by 
the czarists russians in the early 18th century with the collapse 
of the russian monarchy and the defeat of germany in world war i 
the baltic states proclaimed independence in 1918 but under a 
secret agreement with nazi germany josef stalins soviet union 
annexed the baltic states in 1940 
today switzerlandsized estonia is on the front line of 
gorbachevs battle to build citizens economic and political 
initiative 
signs that estonians are taking up his battle cry of 
perestroika gorbachevs policy of restructuring of society 
are all about tallinn the picturesque ancient seaside capital 
shops display colorful westernstyle fashions unseen in other 
soviet stores 
estonians march with their previously banned black blue and 
white national flag 
a nationalist emblem carved in stone on a city building but 
covered up for as long as anyone can remember has suddenly 
reappeared 
the greens environmental group branching out from west 
germany has painted slogans with ecological demands on a barricade 
wall at a construction site 
longbanned plays with nationalist themes are allowed and 
interest in folk choirs has been renewed a cultural 
renaissance is taking place says a musician 
and the ruutsoos after years of underground activism that began 
at tartu university estonias spawning ground for many cultural 
figures they now are central figures in a group called the 
peoples front for perestroika 
all the peoples front leaders are idealists of the 1960s 
explained rein ruutsoo a 41yearold philosopher and communist 
party member the 60s generation hoped to take over the communist 
party we had some illusions now its our second chance 
ruutsoo who refuses to speak russian to protest encroachment of 
the soviet unions largest and most influential republic on 
estonian life explained in english that he was among 40 estonian 
intellectuals who signed a letter in 1980 protesting what they saw 
as the russification of their culture 
the kgb secret police accused his 39yearold wife sirje of 
being a us central intelligence agent for collecting half the 
signatures on the letter two years later she was expelled from 
the communist party for writing a poem in which the first letters 
of each line spelled the colors of the estonian flag 
in those days estonian television announcers were not permitted 
to refer to the region as estonia in weather reports the ruutsoos 
recalled between sips of tea grown in the garden of their home 
they called it just the republic or the baltic area 
throughout the ruutsoos house which has been in reins family 
for four generations is evidence that times have changed 
an estonian flag sits atop the television set and they showed a 
reporter a tshirt imprinted with a map of estonia and the words in 
english go home strangers meaning the russians 
gorbachev has said the kremlin was mistaken in the past to 
suppress national cultures and languages like estonias 
he has promised to be more sensitive to the soviet unions more 
than 100 ethnic groups some of which are now among the most ardent 
practitioners of his glasnost openness epolicy using it to 
express their longrepressed national or ethnic identities 
the peoples front for perestroika is one outgrowth of the new 
tolerance it sprang up in april when the estonian philosopher 
edgar savisaar proposed on television creating a democratic 
movement to support perestroika the group now has 900 affiliates 
with 50000 members in estonia ruutsoo said and sister 
organizations have been formed in latvia and lithuania 
while generally supporting communist party policies the 
peoples front demands political and economic sovereignty of 
union republics and cultural autonomy for all nationalities 
it calls for direct estonian trade ties outside of moscows 
control with foreign companies and says it intends to propose 
legislation and up candidates for government posts the only 
condition for membership is active and businesslike support of 
the course of perestroika 
at first the established leadership in estonia apparently 
fearing a challenge to its authority denied the new group access 
to the republiccontrolled press 
but on june 16 the republics party chief karl vaino a 
holdover from the brezhnev years was replaced by vajno vyalyas a 
gorbachev protege and former soviet ambassador to nicaragua who 
already had respect among estonian intellectuals 
the next day 150000 people gathered in a meadow outside 
tallinn to show their support for the peoples front and to ask 
estonias delegates to the nationa communist party conference in 
moscow to press the groups demands 
the delegation led by vyalyas endorsed the fronts demands for 
local control over the republics finances environmental policy 
culture and education and pleaded their case before the 5000 
communists who assembled in the kremlin june 28july 1 to set party 
policy 
the delegations platform also calls for limiting migration to 
estonia where ethnic estonians now make up just 60 percent of the 
population the republic was 90percent estonian in 1940 
the estonian delegates to the party conference in moscow appear 
to have won much of what they sought at least in principle the 
conference adopted a resolution saying republics were entitled to 
greater independence in economic social cultural and ecological 
spheres 
the peoples front stops short however of calling for 
secession from the soviet union but ruutsoo says its generally 
assumed the goal is a revival of an independent estonia 
sirje ruutsoo doesnt conceal her own thoughts 
its a revolution she said the only thing is tanks are 
on the other side thats the only reason we dont have a new 
republic already

estonias new communist party chief 
vajno vyalyas is a native son attempting the delicate task of 
steering his republic away from moscows tight grip 
the 57yearold descendant of estonian fishermen and seamen took 
office in june in the midst of a vigorous populist movement that is 
seeking more economic cultural and political independence from the 
kremlin 
such movements had been suppressed under vyalyas predecessor 
karl vaino who is remembered by activists here for intolerance and 
a poor command of the estonian language 
vyalyas a history graduate of estonias prestigious tartu 
university doesnt hide his roots 
i was born and raised on this land he said in an interview 
this is my homeland 
on this land worked my ancestors he added i myself am a 
historian and through church lists i managed to ascertain that 
seven generations of them worked on the island hiiumaa an island 
just off the coast 
the brownhaired hazelblueeyed vyalyas spoke in his office in 
communist party headquarters in tallinn estonias capital among 
the few decorations in his office were portraits of vladimir i 
lenin founder of the soviet state and mikhail s gorbachev 
gorbachev and vyalyas both worked in the 1950s and early 1960s 
in the communist partys youth organization komsomol gorbachev 
in his home region of stavropol in southern russia and at moscow 
state university and vyalyas in tartu and tallinn vyalyas went on 
to lead the city party organization in tallinn for 10 years before 
being elected a party secretary for the republicwide party 
apparatus 
after being passed over for the estonian party chiefs job in 
1978 vyalyas joined the soviet diplomatic corps serving as 
ambasssador to venezuela trinidad and tobago and nicaragua 
estonian intellectuals say vyalyas diplomatic experience may be 
helpful in winning the battle for more estonian independence 
vyalyas talks about making estonia more economically independent 
of moscow and preserving its culture and language but he adheres 
to the soviet principle of internationalism the mix of 
national groups under one soviet umbrella 
but he adds a flavoring of his own heritage to it 
islanders are always by nature big internationalists 
vyalyas said chuckling they were all seamen and always said 
any port is my home

to protect farmers from excessive losses during the drought that is 
afflicting large areas of the nation 
but on the eve of his inspection tour of southern illinois 
drought areas wednesday he cautioned we mustnt bust the 
budget 
agriculture experts say that up to 4 inches of rain in the 
flatland region wont help much of the already damaged corn crop 
but the reagan visit they say is a good gesture on the 
presidents part and should help get federal aid for farmers who 
have substantial crop loss

gasoline futures had fared better than oil in recent weeks

even as it posted a big profit gain for its 
second quarter and announced some major management changes cbs 
inc says a scriptwriters strike is clouding the outlook for the 
broadcasting business 
cbs reported wednesday that its secondquarter profit climbed 40 
percent to a record high citing higher interest income improved 
operating efficiency and an increase in broadcast sales despite a 
sluggish advertising market 
but laurence a tisch president and chief executive of cbs 
said in announcing the results that the business outlook for 
broadcasting for the balance of the year is somewhat uncertain 
based largely on the continuing strike by the writers guild of 
america 
the 19week strike threatens to delay the start of the fall 
television season and some network executives fear that without a 
slate of new programming viewers could look elsewhere for 
entertainment and reduce the audience for commercials 
however tisch said cbs had found demand for advance sales of 
fall television time to advertisers was surprisingly strong 
the networks have been conducting their annual upfront ad 
sales for the fall season over the past 10 days and tisch said he 
agreed with published reports that said prime time sales could 
match or exceed last years total 
the strong earnings performance by the cbs broadcast group also 
figured in wednesdays announcement that howard stringer the 
president of cbs news would become president of the cbs broadcast 
group an abc executive david w burke was selected to head the 
news division 
effective aug 1 stringer replaces gene f jankowski 54 who 
has been president of the broadcast group for 11 years and will 
take the newly created post of broadcast group chairman stringer 
46 will report directly to tisch 
burke 52 has been with abc news for 11 years the last two as 
executive vice president his appointment marks the first time cbs 
has gone outside the company for the head of its news division 
tisch said jankowski approached him last week suggesting that 
with this years program development schedule complete and 
sixmonth earnings at a record level it was appropriate for an 
orderly transition in management of the broadcast group in his 
new role jankowski said he will scout possible station 
acquisitions among other things 
the cbs television network struggled during the past season 
with its prime time ratings trailing nbc and abc for the first time 
ever 
financial analysts suggested the changes probably were 
inevitable as tisch made his mark on the company which he has 
headed since the fall of 1986 
larrys putting his man in charge and gene is probably taking 
the first step out the door said edward atorino who follows the 
media business for the investment firm smith barney harris upham amp 
co 
stringer a 23year veteran with cbs had headed cbs news for 22 
months steering the news division through controversial layoffs 
and budget cuts while still managing to launch a news show 48 
hours and keep three primetime news hours on the fall schedule 
phil jones general manager of kctv in kansas city mo and 
former chairman of the cbs affiliates board said stringers 
performance indicates he will be good person to do business 
with 
in its earnings report cbs said it had net income of 1287 
million or 501 a share in the three months ended june 30 
compared with 921 million or 377 a share a year earlier 
revenue rose 4 percent to 740 million from 714 million the 1987 
figures included 193 million income from discontinued operations 
for the first six months of the year cbs earned 104 billion 
or 4043 a share up sevenfold from 1408 million or 570 a 
share a year earlier revenue was unchanged at 144 billion 
the latest results included a gain of 8666 million on asset 
sales while the 1987 figures include 602 million income from 
discontinued operations

gillette co shareholders may get another chance 
to vote in the battle between the personal care products company 
and the dissident investor group attempting to win seats on its 
board of directors 
a federal judge who ruled that gillette inaccurately portrayed 
the group coniston partners during a bitter proxy battle said 
wednesday he was likely to order a new shareholder vote 
us district judge mark l wolf ruled last week that gillette 
inaccurately portrayed coniston in newspaper advertisements leading 
up to the april 21 proxy vote in which shareholders rejected a 
coniston slate of four director candidates 
coniston had called for a new vote in briefs filed this week in 
the second part of the case being held to decide what sort of 
relief coniston deserves wolf tentatively set a second trial to 
begin aug 22 
the judge said at a hearing wednesday likely would invalidate 
the proxy vote and call a new vote regardless of whether he found 
that coniston acted with unclean hands in the period leading up 
to the election 
i continue to believe some relief to shareholders will be 
required he said what i found was that the essence of the 
election was tainted in a material way 
gillette stock closed at 4050 up 225 a share on the new 
york stock exchange 
thats what weve been saying to him coniston attorney mark 
a michelson said of wolfs statement what the judge is saying 
is hes inclined to give the relief we want which is a new 
election 
but gillette spokesman david fausch said wolf was only 
speculating on what action he may take hes made no decision on 
that fausch said of a new vote he said that hes evolving his 
theories and ideas but no decision has been made at all on remedy 
after a sevenday trial wolf ruled july 6 that several gillette 
newspaper ads during the proxy solicitation contained falsely 
misleading information about coniston but he ruled gillette did 
not mislead shareholders when it withheld information about 
potential buyers during the threemonth proxy battle 
wolf also said he was still reviewing whether coniston violated 
full disclosure laws in us securities and exchange commission 
filings including the role of swiss financier tito tettamanti who 
raised 5 million for strategic block investments in gillette 
on wednesday wolf said the second phase of the case may require 
more information on tettamanti 
although he is beyond the subpoena powers of this court 
perhaps he should be invited to come wolf said why doesnt he 
make one of his visits in the last week of august and well ask him 
questions and watch the answers 
gillette on april 14 filed suit seeking to block conistons 
proxy bid on the grounds coniston falsified sec filings and did not 
fully disclose all investors including tettamanti 
a countersuit filed by coniston five days later alleged gillette 
misprepresented coniston in advertisements and mailings to the 
companys 27000 shareholders and failed to publicly disclose all 
companies that had expressed interest in buying gillette 
stockholders rejected the coniston slate of candidates by 52 
percent to 48 percent 
coniston controls 676 million gillette shares or about 58 
percent of the shares outstanding coniston is attempting to 
pressure the 12member gillette board to sell the company which 
likely would boost the value of the groups shares

hewlettpackard co is claiming that 
apple computer inc does not hold valid copyrights for visual 
displays and computer images that are at the center of a legal 
battle between the computer makers 
in a countersuit filed wednesday in response to a us district 
court copyright infringement suit filed by apple hewlettpackard 
alleged that apple was engaged in unfair business practices and 
antitrust violations 
palo altobased hewlett packard denied all of apples suit 
allegations and asked the court to invalidate apples copyrights in 
the case and to dismiss its suit against hewlettpackard 
cupertinobased apple sued hewlettpackard and microsoft corp 
of redmond wash in march charging them with copyright 
infringement in two socalled operating environment programs 
microsofts windows and hewlettpackards newwave 
the programs provide a visual desktop on the screen on 
which a computer user can view various symbols representing 
documents applications programs and places to store information 
in april microsoft submitted a response to the court in san 
jose charging that apple violated contracts acted in bad faith 
and damaged microsofts relations with other companies 
microsoft denied that windows infringed on apple copyrights by 
using images that too closely resembled those of apples popular 
macintosh computer 
apples suit shook software developers and computer makers 
throughout the industry because of its potential scope aside from 
hewlettpackard and microsoft apple also indirectly challenged its 
biggest rival international business machines corp which has 
been incorporating display graphics similar to apples 
apple was seen as essentially asking the court to preserve a 
technological edge it has enjoyed over its competitors just as the 
rivals were closing the gap 
hp is confident the court will agree apples suit has no 
merit said douglas c chance executive vice president of hps 
business systems sector 
apple officials could not be reached for comment wednesday

car sales weakened but stronger light truck 
buying topped period sales records for some manufacturers in early 
july 
jeep vehicles and ford light trucks roared to new sales peaks 
makers said in reporting sales figures wednesday for the july 110 
period 
industrywide domestic light truck sales climbed 86 percent on 
a daily average compared with overall 16 percent decline in daily 
sales of us made cars 
combined car and light truck sales totaled 228870 for the seven 
sales days in the july 110 period and combined sales were up 2 
percent on a daily basis from the comparable 1987 period which 
contained eight days 
chrysler corp sold 21700 cars in the early july period for a 
122 percent increase in daily sales but general motors corps 
sales of 66737 cars and ford motor cos sales of 41436 vehicles 
both represented 58 percent declines 
david healy automotive analyst with drexel burnham lambert 
inc said the slowed sales did not represent a significant change 
i think sales are just bouncing around reflecting the timing of 
incentives he said 
general motors and ford recently cut back on buyer incentives 
chrysler had said its current campaign would expire tuesday then 
announced a new slightly smaller package that day 
there may have been some people in there buying because they 
thought the incentives were about to end said chrysler spokesman 
tom houston 
ray windecker an analyst at ford said the timing of incentives 
pushed fords car sales up in late june with a resulting early july 
fallback 
but car sales may continue tapering off because makers are not 
oversupplied and will have no reason to offer the fire sale 
style incentives of august and september of 1986 and 1987 said 
chris cedergren analyst at jd power amp associates in agoura 
hills calif 
in contrast fords sales of 30869 light trucks an average of 
4410 a day broke a july 110 record rate of 4312 set in 1973 
when a dealer incentive program concluded on july 10 windecker 
said 
and chrysler said sales of 5110 jeep vehicles surpassed the 
4944 units of the best previous july 110 period for jeeps in 
1986

japanese government and business leaders expressed 
regret thursday over the us house of representatives passage of 
a trade bill that they described as protectionist 
foreign minister sosuke uno called the bill problematical 
and said japan strongly hoped the reagan administration will 
continue to oppose protectionism 
a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said japan had serious concerns about the bill and he hoped 
the united states will stick to the rules governing 
international trade 
the governments chief spokesman keizo obuchi told a news 
conference the passage of the bill was regrettable and expressed 
hope reagan will veto the legislation the bill must still pass the 
senate 
the government hopes the reagan administration will fight 
protectionism and that this protectionist bill will not be 
enacted obuchi said 
joichi aoi president of toshiba corp said the bill unfairly 
singles out his company for a subsidiarys sale of hightechnology 
machine tools to the soviet union the sale was made in violation 
of the rules of the coordinating committee for export control a 
multilateral agreement regulating the flow of western technology to 
communist nations 
us officials have charged that the machine tools sold by 
toshiba machine co helped the soviet union build quieter 
submarine propellers 
our position has been that any us sanctions against a 
foreign firm for violating cocom regulations would be contrary to 
the principle of cocom which holds that transgressors of the 
export regulations must be punished under the laws of the 
individual countries where the incidents occur aoi said 
the toshiba provision in the trade bill calls for barring 
toshiba corp from sales to the us government for three years 
and prohibits toshiba machine co from all exports to the united 
states for the same duration 
other japanese business leaders also expressed regret over the 
house action saying it would have an adverse effect on japanus 
relations 
takashi ishihara president of the japan association of 
corporate executives called the vote shortsighted and untimely 
because it came only a few days after the release of japans trade 
figures for june which showed a rapid decline in the countrys 
trade surplus with the united states 
the foreign ministry official said the trade bill as drafted 
does not violate regulations of the general agreement on tariffs 
and trade an international trade body but he said the bill 
contains enough enforcement latitude to allow possible violation of 
gatt rules in practice

japan said thursday its trade figures with the 
united states have improved dramatically in the past six months and 
predicted the trend will continue for the rest of the year 
overall the trade surplus with the united states was down 149 
percent during the period from january through june compared with 
the same period last year according to statistics from the foreign 
ministry 
imports rose 408 percent in dollar terms while exports were up 
only 58 percent 
part of the improvement was attributable to a decline in the 
value of the dollar which makes imports in dollar terms seem 
greater 
in yen terms imports were up 197 percent while exports were 
up 99 percent 
in overall trade imports were up 343 percent in dollar terms 
and exports were up 157 percent the balance of trade 
internationally declined by 159 percent 
a foreign ministry spokesman who demanded anonymity said he 
was pleased with the latest figures and said japan was working hard 
to solve international trade problems 
he said japan in the first half of this year had made 
significant progress in resolving thorny trade issues such as beef 
and citrus quotas with the united states a new science and 
technology agreement with washington and an agreement to open its 
construction industry to foreign competition 
according to the trade figures imports of wood products from 
the united states were up a sharp 52 percent foodstuff imports 
were up 34 percent and machinery imports were up 58 percent 
the official said he expected these trends to continue but said 
we cant be too complacent he said twoway trade cannot always 
be free from friction but he said japan has shown to the world 
it is capable of dealing with these issues

britains unemployment rate fell to a seasonally 
adjusted 84 percent in june from 86 percent in the previous 
month while industrial production rose 06 percent in may the 
government said thursday 
the unemployment rate also was down from 104 percent in june 
1987 the department of employment said 
however the department said half the decline in the latest 
month was the result of a new definition of employment people 
employed by government job training programs now are being counted 
as employed 
the new practice brings britain more in line with other european 
countries methods of defining employment and adds about 334000 
persons to the ranks of the employed the department said 
total seasonally adjusted british unemployment came to 238 
million people in june down from a revised 241 million people in 
may and 292 million people in june 1987 the department said 
meanwhile industrial production was up 38 percent from a year 
earlier according to the central statistical office 
the latest figures compare with aprils revised 1 percent 
monthtomonth rise and 4 percent yeartoyear rise 
the office said the index of industrial production which uses a 
1980 base of 100 rose to 1167 in may from a revised 116 in april 
and was up from 1124 in may 1987

ohio suzuki dealers in an attempt to restore 
confidence in the companys sharply criticized samurai model are 
offering a 1 million accidental life insurance policy free for one 
year to people who buy or lease the vehicle 
you cant run enough ads to erase the cloud that all of this 
has put over the car said robert reichert president of the 
kenwood dealer group on wednesday the sales promotion ends aug 
31 but may be continued if buyers show renewed confidence in the 
model reichert said 
he said he worked with other ohio suzuki dealers on the plan 
we decided that we needed something emphatic he said 
charges by consumers union that the vehicle tips over too easily 
caused national sales of the samurai to drop by 706 percent in 
june 
american suzuki motor corp which had been selling about 6000 
a month of the vehicles from march through may reported it sold 
2199 samurais in june compared to 7479 in june 1987 
reichert said suzuki dealers have considerable data to dispute 
the information put out by consumers union which publishes 
consumer reports magazine consumers union says suzuki should 
recall the vehicle and give car owners refunds 
we felt there was very little we could do to effectively fight 
the negative publicity other than offer a bigpromotion to show 
that the samurai is safe reichert said 
the insurance program which starts friday is being 
underwritten by the american international group of insurance 
companies 
in a separate move american suzuki officials on wednesday 
disclosed to dealers plans to offer a 2000 discount off the 
samurais regular price for a limited time 
reichert said the dealers offer the insurance policy for one 
year but buyers can renew after that time and pay for it themselves 
its a typical accident policy said reichert if a person 
is killed when a samarai turns over or tips over the policy will 
pay 1 million 
but were going to tell tham that these things are not built 
to turn corners at 80 mph like any other car these things can 
turn over reichert said 
reichert said the aug 31 limitation was set to comply with ohio 
law that limits the time of sales promotions

a pair of government contractors billed the 
army for 23 hours of work at the redstone arsenal in alabama even 
though the job they performed took only 45 minutes says a 
congressional watchdog agency 
and in another incident at redstone the contractors billed the 
pentagon for the work of 10 men to paint stripes on a parking lot 
even though two of them did all the painting while the other eight 
stood around the general accounting office said 
the idle workers were often told to hide from government 
inspectors a gao witness told a house subcommittee on wednesday 
the incidents are part of an investigation in which the fbi and 
the armys criminal investigative division are probing contracts at 
the huntsville installation the gao said 
the redstone investigations are unrelated to the investigation 
into allegations that defense contractors and their consultants 
bribed pentagon officials for inside information that could have 
been vital in bidding for contracts worth billions of dollars no 
charges have been filed 
the redstone case was revealed by david c williams of the gaos 
office of special investigations he was testifying before the 
government operations national security subcommittee 
the redstone case in which the 45minute job was inflated and 
the parking lot was painted involves a fiveyear 250 million 
contract for base support activities including maintenance food 
service and equipment repair williams said 
the contract was between the army missile command and two 
contractors who formed a joint venture to bid on the project they 
are the holmes and narver corp of orange calif and the 
morrisonknudsen corp of boise idaho 
the investigation showed that to cover for falsified labor 
charges materials had to be expended and building supplies were 
given away to contract workers and government employees williams 
said 
materials such as paint were discarded in dumpsters and and 
other times thrown into the tennessee river williams 
a review of vehicle maintenance records looking only at oil 
changes and lube jobs showed that the government was overcharged 
by 262 percent or 5000 hours each year he said 
this type of charge attempted to justify the excessive costs 
for that year and created an inflated cost history for future 
projected increases in the contract he explained in fact the 
fiveyear contract has increased over its original bid by more than 
100 million 
officials at the army base at huntsville and holmes and narver 
did not return telephoned requests for reaction to williams 
statements 
vern nelson a spokesman for morrisonknudsen said we are 
aware the general accounting office has been auditing these 
operations and we have been fully cooperating with the gao 
representatives we have just received the gao congressional 
testimony and are reviewing the matter 
williams also said that a 1987 study of 263 timeandmaterial 
contracts to small businesses turned up some suspicious facts 
for example he said 45 percent of those 263 contracts showed 
that the bids were within 1 percent of the governments cost 
estimates suggesting that there might have been unauthorized 
releases of government estimates or that contractors themselves 
prepared the governments cost estimates either practice 
compromises the governments ability to ensure a fair and 
reasonable price 
in yet another case said williams there was apparent 
favoritism in two contract awards by army lt gen john wall 
commander of the army strategic defense command toward bdm 
international inc of mclean va 
in one case wall directed bdm to be interim contractor for a 
major research initiative in another case according to williams 
bdm lost out to teledyne brown engineering on a 500 million 
contract but wall ordered that 240000 hours of support work be 
shifted from teledyne to bdm 
since bdm charges 15 per hour more than teledyne williams 
said this could result in an expected increase in cost of 
approximately 36 million 
wall was investigated by the army cid and retired in june 
williams said attempts to locate him for comment were not 
successful 
james hughes a spokesman for bdm said there was no 
suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of bdm in the army 
investigation

several of the nations major banks raised their prime lending 
rate today by half a percentage point to 95 percent the highest 
level in more than two years 
it was the second boost in the key lending rate this year and 
signaled a new round of higher interest rates for consumers on 
loans for purchases ranging from automobiles to homes 
the increase came one day after federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan warned he would use the central banks power to tighten 
credit if inflation started to accelerate 
separately american consumers boosted retail sales 05 percent 
in june by purchasing more cars and summer gear the government 
reported today but the increase wasnt as strong as expected and 
could ease concerns about inflation 
the commerce department said sales increased 713 million last 
month to a seasonally adjusted but not inflationadjusted 1328 
billion much of the increase came from sales of autos air 
conditioners barbecues and clothes 
analysts had been expecting a gain of about 08 percent the 
moderate june increase therefore may dampen anxiety in financial 
markets that the economy is too strong lessening pressure on the 
federal reserve to tighten credit 
the retail sales report came a day after fed chairman alan 
greenspan warned he would use higher interest rates to battle any 
resurgence of inflation 
currency investors interpreted greenspans comments as 
supportive of the dollar which finished mostly higher despite 
reports of central bank intervention but the stock market 
discounted his warnings and the bond market was mixed 
delivering his midyear report to congress on monetary policy 
greenspan also said the fed and other central banks would continue 
to work for stable exchange rates he said he saw no evidence that 
the growth of us exports has been affected by the dollars recent 
rise against other major currencies 
greenspan said the central bank stands ready to push interest 
rates higher to stem inflation and the risks of a new wageprice 
spiral are sufficiently great that the fed should err on the 
side of squeezing credit rather than stimulating the economy he 
said 
greenspan said the fed already has made a series of small 
credittightening steps from late march through late june allowing 
shortterm interest rates to rise 
nevertheless inflationary pressures including tight labor 
markets high factory operating rates and droughtcaused increases 
in grain prices remain and must be curbed now rather than later 
he said 
greenspans pledge to continue fighting inflation gave bond 
prices an early boost but they finished mixed 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials down 
about 10 points at its afternoon low closed with an 1173 point 
gain at 210437 the late round of buying was attributed by 
analysts to computer program trading 
grain and soybean futures closed sharply higher on the chicago 
board of trade with most contracts up their allowable limit in 
reaction to tuesdays government report showing severe drought 
damage to crops 
crude oil prices skidded to a 21month low as traders grew more 
pessimistic about overproduction by opec members on the new york 
mercantile exchange the augustdelivery price of west texas 
intermediate crude fell 28 cents to close at 1444 a barrel 
in other economic developments wednesday 
automakers reported that buyers reacting to changing incentive 
offerings pushed domestic car sales down at general motors corp 
and ford motor co but up at no 3 chrysler corp 
the house passed a revamped version of the massive trade bill 
now tailored to conditions set by president reagan when he vetoed

the us appetite for foreign oil increased sharply in the 
first half of the year while domestic crude production kept 
declining an industry report showed

the chicago board options exchange smarting 
from a 50 percent downturn in options trading since the oct 19 
stock market collapse is trying to persuade brokers and investors 
to return to the market 
the market is dispatching teams to 30 cities to contact brokers 
explain what happened and promote stock options sales to put a 
floor under losses for potential investors 
were trying to rebuild the business said james emerson a 
marketing consultant with the exchange who will travel to san 
antonio memphis and new orleans next week 
after a fiveyear bull market when confidence in the financial 
markets blossomed to an alltime high individual investors were 
badly shaken by the october debacle and have been slow to return 
shortly after oct 19 options trading volume on the chicago 
board options exchange fell by 50 percent emerson said trading 
has slowly improved but has yet to approach preoctober levels he 
said 
individual investors make up about 75 percent of the exchanges 
clientele its recovery has been somewhat slower than the 
institutiondriven stock market 
emerson says the chicago board options exchange which accounts 
for 55 percent of all listed options traded in the united states 
has slashed staff cutting the fat down to the muscle 
the most noticeable change is that consumers are less eager to 
enter the risky business of call and put options 
a call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a security 
based on the expectation that a stock will rise in price a put 
option is the right to sell 100 shares of a security on the 
expectation that the stocks price will fall 
to counter consumer fears emerson suggests that brokerages use 
options to reduce risk and make a portfolio more conservative 
for instance an investor might buy a certain companys stock 
then purchase put options on that same stock the strategy puts a 
floor on losses regardless of whether the stock price rises or 
falls 
were not presenting anything thats brand new emerson 
said but by reminding brokers about the advantages of options 
trading he hopes many of them will start calling clients again

a veto of a bill to require that workers be 
given advance notice of plant closings and layoffs would be a 
projobs move and not hurt vice president george bushs 
presidential campaign white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
today 
the senior advisers recommend a veto and it was a major 
reason why president reagan vetoed the trade bill fitzwater 
said aboard air force one as reagan flew to marion ill to visit 
a droughtstriken farm he was later flying to davenport iowa 
fiftyfour of the 177 house republicans abandoned the 
administration and bush on the issue wednesday nineteen of the 
senates 46 republicans did the same last week as congress heads 
for a showdown with reagan over the issue 
we support the concept but believe it ought to be a part of 
labormanagement agreements fitzwater said 
we believe this bill stymies job creation puts structural 
rigidities in the market to make it more difficult to expand plant 
capacity and create more employment so we consider our position on 
plant closings as a projobs position he said 
fitzwater denied that a veto of the measure which had earlier 
been included in a trade bill reagan vetoed would prove 
politically damaging to bush 
on a 286136 vote more than the twothirds needed to enact the 
law over a veto from reagan the house voted wednesday to let 
workers caught up in plant closings or layoffs involving more than 
50 of them know about it 60 days beforehand 
the senate approved the same measure a week ago by a vetoproof 
7223 vote in the biggest legislative battle of the decade between 
corporate america and labor unions 
house republicans aware of polls showing that more than 80 
percent of the american public favor the notices are distancing 
themselves from reagan and bush on the issue 
i dont think hell be able to sustain a veto said rep 
marge roukema rnj who led the house fight against the 
mandatory notices through the legislative process but voted for the 
bill wednesday 
there are a lot more than 54 republicans who dont want him to 
veto it she said we fought every fight but you have to 
pick your battles bush is going to have to handle the issue now 
immediately after the vote on the layoff notices wednesday the 
house approved by an even larger 37645 vote a trade bill that 
president reagan vetoed in may because the plant closing and layoff 
notices were then a part of it 
the 141 millionmember aflcio possessing onesixth of the 
delegates at next weeks democratic national convention has 
threatened to withdraw its pivotal support for overhauling the 
nations trade laws if the plant closing notices are not enacted 
separately 
and the labor movements chief supporters in the senate edward 
m kennedy dmass and howard metzenbaum dohio have vowed to 
reattach the notices to the trade legislation or kill the bill 
entirely if reagans veto of them as a separate measure is upheld 
todays house vote coupled with last weeks overwhelming 
senate margin clearly give the white house a strong message that 
this bill should be signed aflcio president lane kirkland said 
wednesday 
in vetoing the trade bill in may reagan echoed the sentiments 
of business groups such as the national association of 
manufacturers us chamber of commerce and the business 
roundtable which oppose notices of plant closings or impending 
layoffs reagan called them anticompetitive and said they would 
stifle the creation of new jobs 
under the constitution reagan has 10 days excluding sundays 
to veto the measure after it reaches his desk which house leaders 
said will be sometime next week that gives democrats time for a 
veto override vote before the republican national convention the 
second week of august 
i suspect the president will veto it house minority leader 
robert michel rill said wednesday the legislation is here to 
create an issue not because people are demanding it 
bush has steadfastly supported reagans position that companies 
should tell workers well in advance they are about to lose their 
jobs but that the government shouldnt make them do it 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis said wednesday 
he will sign the bill into law the first month of his presidency if 
elected in november 
there is now a national consensus for national plant closing 
legislation dukakis said in a statement also attacking reagans 
handling of sofar unsuccessful efforts to oust panamanian leader 
manuel noriega after his indictment by a us grand jury on drug 
smuggling charges 
an administration that is willing to give general noriega 120 
days notice certainly ought to be willing to give hardworking 
honest american workers and their families at least half that time 
when they lose their job dukakis said 
white house officials have said that reagan himself has not 
stated definitely that he would veto the notices business groups 
however said wednesday they are still counting on him for a veto 
if he vetoed the trade bill because of it i dont know why he 
would turn around now said renee reymond the national 
association of manufacturers chief lobbyist on the issue this 
isnt over yet i think some republicans will come back with us 
mark de bernardo the chamber of commerces chief labor 
lobbyist said opponents remain within striking distance of 
sustaining a veto 
we recognize that the agenda of organized labor is much more 
ambitious de bernardo said the chamber will continue to 
support the administration as it supports the business community 
against this illadvised measure

unisys corp which is being investigated 
for allegedly fraudulent defense procurement practices confirmed 
today it may face charges for its billing for computer work done 
for the us army 
in a statement the company said it has been cooperating with 
the office of the us attorney in tucson ariz in its 
investigation of a contract with the army communications center 
based in fort huachuca 
a story in the wall street journal wednesday said the us 
attorneys office in tucson planned to seek criminal charges 
against a unisys unit and two company officials 
the overcharges in computer could reach as much as 10 million 
the journal said they stem from several years of work on the army 
information systems command in fort huachuca ariz 
however wren timberlake a spokesman at the arizona base said 
the entire contract in question was for 92 million 
unisys said it totaled 8 million and that the alleged 
overcharges did not exceed 250000 the company said the contract 
with the army was entered into in 1982 by sperry corp which 
merged with burroughs corp in 1986 and became unisys 
if there were overcharges they were significantly less than 
10 million timberlake said 
im not certain the alleged charges involved any money at all 
the alleged administrative shortcoming involved in this case was 
more the procedural irregularities in the way the government was 
billed he said 
the journal reported that unisys had voluntarily disclosed the 
problems at fort huachuca provided additional information to the 
justice department as the investigation progressed and pledged to 
take corrective action to prevent recurrence 
the company has three contracts with the army at fort huachuca 
totaling 70 million timberlake said adding that the army and 
unisys continue to have a fine relationship 
unisys had 97 billion in revenues last year of which 25 
percent or 24 billion came from defense work

italys pasta purity law was overturned 
thursday opening the door to imports from other european countries 
and touching off warnings of an invasion of mushy macaroni 
the european economic communitys court of justice in luxembourg 
ruled italy could not ban imports under its 1967 law requiring that 
all pasta be made with durum wheat 
pasta made of durum wheat is more firm but also more expensive 
than macaroni made from other kinds of wheat 
in the coming weeks italians will have to say goodbye to 
their beloved firm pasta said the leftleaning newspaper la 
repubblica in an article headlined pasta without durum will soon 
invade italy if the eec has its way 
that flavorful and firm macaroni the product of our able 
pasta makers will be challenged and maybe even replaced by the 
gluey and insipid pasta from germany or holland the newspaper 
said 
even with the current emphasis on eating less italians consume 
an average of 55 pounds a year each it is always cooked al 
dente or firm 
the case dubbed pasta wars by the italian press was 
brought to the court by the west german pasta producer drei 
glocken the firm was blocked in 1985 from importing pasta made 
with mixed wheat into italy 
according to the ruling italy can still require its own pasta 
makers to use only durum wheat but it cannot use the law to block 
pasta imports from the other 11 nations in the eec 
the decision was based in part on a march 1987 ruling by the 
court of justice that west germanys beer purity law violated the 
eecs free trade rules by keeping out cheaper foreign beers

gaf corp and its vice chairman pleaded innocent 
thursday to charges they manipulated union carbide corps stock 
price after a takeover attempt of the much larger company fizzled 
in 1986 
during a brief proceeding in federal court lawyers for gaf and 
james sherwin entered the pleas to the 10count indictment returned 
last week by a grand jury 
sherwin who could face a 50year prison term and 15 million in 
fines if convicted was released without bail us district judge 
mary johnson lowe who was assigned the case did not immediately 
set a trial date 
the indictment marked the first criminal charges against an 
american industrial enterprise stemming indirectly from revelations 
of ivan boesky the wall street felon at the center of the 
widespread insider trading scandal boesky is serving a threeyear 
prison term and cooperating with government investigators 
according to the indictment gaf and sherwin attempted to create 
an artificial demand for carbide stock after gafs takeover attempt 
on carbide failed in october 1986 
their alleged motive was to induce other investors to buy 
carbide shares and thereby inflate the price so gaf could sell its 
10 percent stake at a better profit or with minimal loss 
if convicted on all counts gaf could face 15 million in fines 
based in wayne nj gaf is a major producer of chemicals and 
building materials

share prices finished lower in choppy trading 
thursday on the london stock exchange after being whipsawed by 
british economic reports and by news that major us banks raised 
their prime lending rates to 95 percent from 9 percent 
however market players were reluctant to significantly change 
their positions ahead of fridays barrage of us economic 
indicators dealers said 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished the 
day down 8 points or 04 percent at 18633 its lowest level of 
the day 
trading volume was a relatively robust 5266 million shares up 
from wednesdays 4308 million shares 
the us trade report for may producer prices for june 
industrial production data for june and business inventories for 
may are due to be released friday by the government in washington 
in addition the british retail price index for june is to be 
reported 
weve been up and down like a yoyo today one london equity 
salesman said he said the market had been doing quite well on the 
spate of british economic reports released early thursday until the 
prime rate hikes at midafternoon knocked us down like a ton of 
bricks 
of particular interest to the london market was news that the 
underlying annual rate of increase in british average earnings held 
steady at 85 percent in may following a downward revision in 
april to 85 percent from 875 percent 
that report helped eased fears about inflation but the market 
quickly became unsettled by the prime rate increase analysts said

forecasts for another month of drought conditions 
in the midwest drove prices for most corn oat and soybean futures 
up their allowable limits thursday on the chicago board of trade 
but profittaking cooled the advance in prices for nearterm 
delivery and wheat futures closed lower after failing to hold new 
contract highs 
all corn oat and soybean contracts soared their respective 
limits at the opening in response to the national weather services 
6to10day and 30day forecasts for abovenormal temperatures and 
belownormal rainfall in the farm belt 
most of those contracts held their limit gains through the 
close but the july contracts on which the limits have been 
removed pending their expiration next wednesday closed with 
relatively modest gains 
analysts said the pattern indicated profittaking perhaps 
stemming from increased chances of rain in the midwest on friday 
wheat settled 4 cents to 10 cents lower with july at 387 a 
bushel corn was 2 cents to 15 cents higher with july at 335 a 
bushel oats were 3 cents to 15 cents higher with july at 308 a 
bushel soybeans were 31 cents to 45 cents higher with july at

mci communications corp signaled confidence in 
its future thursday by announcing plans to repurchase for 677 
million the 162 percent stake held by its largest shareholder 
international business machines corp 
but mci defrayed the cost and kept a link to ibm by saying it 
would sell ibm a new issue of 400 million in preferred shares the 
shares will give ibm 10 percent of the voting rights in mci 
investors reacted positively to the announcement bidding mci up 
75 cents to 1612 a share in overthecounter trading a 5 
percent increase 
mcis stock has doubled from 8 a share a year ago and more than 
tripled from its low of 5 a share in early 1987 the 
secondbiggest longdistance phone company was staggering then from 
a bloody 1986 in which it lost 448 million 
investors have been impressed by washingtonbased mcis ability 
to lure bigbusiness accounts and 800number service away from 
american telephone amp telegraph co the market leader also the 
multibilliondollar cost of constructing a nationwide fiber network 
is mostly complete 
however mcis stock remains far below the peak of 2850 a 
share adjusted for stock splits that was reached in 1983 one 
continuing worry is that mci could suffer in price battles if atampt 
wins the freedom on pricesetting it has been seeking 
atampt unlike its competitors requires governmental approval 
before it can offer special low rates to certain customers to get 
or keep their business 
ibms agreement to sell its common shares was not seen as a 
split between it and mci for one thing ibm will still have 10 
percent of the voting rights through its nontradable issue of 
preferred shares also the companies had not been tightly coupled 
anyway in spite of some cooperative marketing and development 
projects which will continue 
at the time they bought it the mci stake ibm looked at it 
more as an insurance policy in case atampt came up with something 
that really integrated computers and communications in some sort of 
unique highly valueadded way said charles schelke an analyst 
for smith barney harris upham amp co 
instead most companies have since decided it is not important 
for computer makers to own transmission networks or for 
longdistance companies to own computer operations atampt with big 
commitments in both areas is an exception 
this indicates the confidence that the management and the 
directors of mci have in their future said james m mccabe an 
analyst for nomura securities international inc 
when they did the transaction it helped mci that they had a 
big brother like ibm in the ensuing period mcis fortunes have 
changed for the better dramatically mccabe said 
ibm acquired its stake in mci in march 1986 as part of its sale 
to mci of satellite business systems a longdistance 
communications unit 
mci is paying less than the market price to repurchase its 
stock at the closing price of 1537 a share wednesday in 
overthecounter trading the roughly 47 million shares would have 
cost more than 720 million 
the deal was negotiated at a time when mcis rapidly rising 
stock was trading at a lower price daniel f akerson mcis chief 
financial officer said in an interview 
ibm spokesman michael starks said the sale represented a gain 
for ibm which had been carrying the stock on its books at a value 
of 528 million

federal home loan mortgage corps preferred 
stock soared in heavy trading thursday when the first in a series 
of ownership restrictions were lifted in a move that could bring 
fresh capital to the savings and loan industry 
in composite nationwide trading of issues listed on the new york 
stock exchange the shares jumped 3275 a share to 13275 the 
first opportunity savings and loan institutions have had to boost 
their holdings beyond 150000 shares 
analysts have speculated the stock could trade as high as 200 a 
share 
the board of the federal home loan mortgage corp known as 
freddie mac approved a plan wednesday to increase the number of 
shares that savings institutions may own and to allow the public to 
own shares beginning jan 1 
freddie mac is a congressionally created entity that buys home 
mortgages from savings insitutions and other lenders and packages 
them into securities for resale to investors thus making more 
money available for home buyers 
freddie mac voting stock is owned by the federal home loan bank 
system which in turn is owned by the nations savings 
institutions its perferred stock which has no voting power is 
held now only by savings institutions 
under terms of the plan approved wednesday the limits on the 
number of shares a single stockholder may own were immediately 
lifted from 150000 to 300000 the limit will rise to 450000 on 
oct 1 and to 600000 on jan 1 
savings institutions will be permitted until nov 30 to exchange 
restricted shares for shares that public investors will be 
permitted to buy after jan 1 the institutions will have to pay a 
7ashare fee for the exchange 
freddie mac has 15 million preferred shares outstanding 
ownership restrictions on the 100000 outstanding shares of voting 
stock are unaffected and remain in place 
analysts said the stock is an attractive buy because of the 
earning power behind it 
as it trades it will trade up in value which means the value 
of the holdings of the sampls that own stock will go up and boost 
their capital positions which is what they desperately need 
said charles vincent an analyst at provident national bank in 
philadelphia 
in addition vincent noted that since freddie mac is a 
government agency there is virtually no risk in holding the shares 
vincent said the individual thrifts must choose whether to 
sell their shares to boost their capital position or hold on to 
show an appreciation on their investment

the dollar rose in domestic dealings thursday 
despite concern over an upcoming report on the nations trade 
deficit 
gold prices fell in domestic trading after rising overseas 
republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid of 43835 for 
one troy ounce of gold down from wednesdays late bid of 44025 
the foreign exchange market largely ignored a hike in a key 
lending rate by several us commercial banks as the dollar settled 
above the pscyhologically important barrier of 18500 west german 
marks despite central bank intervention the dollar had not closed 
at these levels since last august 
traders said the market is focused primarily on the commerce 
departments release on friday of us merchandise trade data for 
may concern over the report also dominated the currency markets in 
europe where the dollar finished mostly higher in light dealings 
the market is still bullish about the dollar even if the 
number does come in at 115 billion said cynthia johnson vice 
president and foreign exchange manager at lloyds bank plcs north 
american office in new york 
the trade deficit registered a narrow 99 billion in april but 
the consensus in the market is that a singledigit figure is 
unlikely for may 
traders said the federal reserve stepped in when the dollar 
reached 18500 west german marks in an attempt to stem its rise 
one trader said the us central bank sold quite a substantial 
amount of dollars during the intervention 
a trader in frankfurt predicted massive intervention by both 
the west german and us central banks in the event of a 
lowerthanexpected deficit which would help push the dollar 
higher 
several us banks announced a half a percentage point increase 
in the prime rate putting the key lending rate at 95 percent its 
highest level in more than two years but there was little reaction 
in the market 
the prime rate hike had been pretty much expected said 
michael malpede a senior currency analyst at refco group in 
chicago the timing may have been a bit unusual but it is a 
lagging indicator 
generally however higher interest rates at home can be bullish 
for the value of the dollar because they attract more foreign 
investment to the united states 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day 
begins the dollar rose 048 yen to a closing 13295 japanese yen 
later in london it edged up to 13312 yen in new york the dollar 
finished at 13318 yen up from 13269 yen on wednesday

the hike in the prime lending rate thursday to 
its highest level in more than two years is not the start of 
another upward spiral in interest rates many economists maintained 
they predicted that rates will hold at current levels probably 
until after the november election but they conceded that this 
forecast is contingent on a slowdown in overall economic growth 
if this expected slowdown does not occur and inflationary 
pressures remain high then their interest rate forecasts will be 
proven wrong analysts said 
big banks raised their prime lending rate onehalf percentge 
point to 95 percent on thursday it was the second boost this year 
and put the key borrowing rate at its highest level since march 
1986 
the increase followed by one day stern warnings from federal 
reserve chairman alan greenspan that the central bank stood ready 
to tighten credit even further if inflation shows signs of 
worsening 
some economists said greenspans tough talk put financial 
markets on notice that the central bank will be pushing interest 
rates higher in the weeks ahead 
but other analysts read greenspans comments as a signal that 
while the fed did tighten credit conditions significantly from late 
march to late june the tightening process is over for the time 
being 
for one thing greenspan appeared to downplay prospects that the 
central bank soon would hike its discount rate which has been at 6 
percent since last september 
an increase in the discount rate the interest the fed charges 
to make loans to financial institutions is the most dramatic 
signal the central bank can send of its intentions to tighten 
credit 
in the first five months of the year retail prices increased at 
an annual rate of 44 percent the inflation rate for all of 1987 
and inflation appeared to be slightly stronger in the last few 
months than earlier this year 
greenspan made it clear that he believed unemployment which 
dropped to a 14year low of 53 percent in june cannot go much 
lower without risking accelerating wage demands and higher 
inflation but he indicated that he expected both the unemployment 
rate and current high factory operating rates will begin leveling 
off in the months ahead 
analysts said these two indicators of economic strength along 
with the various measurements of inflation will be the key ones to 
watch to determine future interest rate moves 
greenspans testimony indicates that the central bank expects 
the economy to soften and inflation to settle down in the second 
half of the year said allen sinai chief economist of the boston 
co if that forecast comes true then there will be no need for 
the fed to tighten further 
david jones an economist with aubrey g lanston amp co said the 
latest increase in the prime rate was in response to the fed 
tightening which has already occurred 
greenspan indicated that over the past three months the fed has 
pushed up a key shortterm interest rate the federal funds rate 
by a full percentage point 
the federal funds rate is the interest banks charge each other 
for overnight loans and it is heavily influenced by fed decisions 
on bank reserves 
the hike in the prime rate is not the start of something new 
it is simply a reflection of the earlier tightening steps jones 
said i think we will see interest rates remain stable at these 
levels for the next few months 
david wyss chief financial economist of data resources inc 
predicted a period of steady interest rates between now and the 
november election saying that neither the fed nor major banks want 
to risk getting embroiled in the presidential campaign by making 
further tightening moves 
wyss said that based on banks cost of funds an increase of 
025 percentage points in the prime rate on thursday would have 
been more justified than the onehalf percentage point increase 
which did occur 
i think the banks wanted to get all of the bad news out of the 
way before the election wyss said the closer you get to an 
election the harder it is to raise rates because the more 
politically sensitive such a decision is 
while predicting a period of stable rates for now many 
economists said they believed rates will head higher before the end 
of the year in part because of a belief that inflation will remain 
higher than the fed will be willing to tolerate 
some analysts said they were looking for fixedrate mortages 
which are currently at 104 percent to be around 11 percent by the 
end of the year they said they expected one more rise in the prime 
rate as well after the election boosting it to 10 percent

a judge ruled against a shareholder challenge to 
amoco canadas 45 billion takeover of dome petroleum on thursday 
and amoco indicated it believed the transaction could be completed 
within months 
justice gregory forsyth of court of queens bench ruled that the 
acquisition was fair to all parties and he saw no need for amoco 
to amend its buyout proposal 
the ruling went against preferred shareholder gordon savage who 
headed the last of three shareholder groups including one headed 
by dome founder jack gallagher opposed to the transaction the 
other two bowed out about two weeks ago after accepting settlements 
from amoco 
i have foundthat the bid for dome was done in a competitive 
fashion and resulted in the best possible price forsyth ruled 
allan sternberg savages attorney would not say whether he 
will appeal the ruling sternberg had indicated during the fairness 
hearing he would appeal any decision in favor of domeamoco he has 
20 days to do so 
sternberg told reporters he wants to reserve comment until the 
court decides who is responsible for costs in the case 
t don stacy president of the usowned amoco canada told 
reporters the company was pleased with the decision but noted 
several hurdles remained before the merger could be completed 
one issue is a 331 million loan to dome by the arctic petroleum 
corp of japan the consortium loaned dome the money for beaufort 
sea exploration and now seeks better repayment terms than amoco is 
offering 
asked if the consortium could still scuttle the entire deal 
stacy said yes but he said there had been progress in 
resolving the matter 
in a news release stacy said he hoped to close the dome 
acquisition next month 
bidding for dome closed almost 15 months ago amoco hoped its 
merger would be complete in six months but that was before some of 
the debtridden companys creditors and shareholders challenged the 
move in court forsyth threw out the challenges one by one 
the fairness hearing was the last legal obstacle to amocos 
acquistion of dome which is about 52 billion in debt 
sternberg had argued that shareholders did not have complete 
information when they voted 87 per cent in favor of the deal early 
last month he contended shareholders were unaware of an internal 
amoco document since made public showing the company estimated 
domes value at up to 6 billion and were unaware of a competing 
54 billion buyout offer by a group of middle eastern oilmen 
forsyth dismissed both claims saying the competing offer was 
nothing more than a sham and that shareholder information 
packages were prepared and distributed correctly

president reagan lending moral support to 
droughtstricken farmers while congress mulls financial relief 
said thursday the government must act quickly to help america cope 
with the worst natural disaster since the dust bowl of the 
1930s 
what i saw was not a pretty sight reagan said after walking 
through sunparched corn and soybean fields in his native illinois 
stunted corn sparse beanfields withered plants starved for 
water struggling to push their way through 
he promised farmers that we will do everything that we can 
at the same time he called on congress to act quickly on a 
package of legislation aimed at making emergency federal aid 
available to farmers 
after inspecting fields on foot and by helicopter the president 
held up a portion of a corn stalk and told reporters this is the 
tassle you see but theres no silk yet 
reagan who returned to the white house in early evening used 
his tour to announce that he was dispatching agriculture secretary 
richard lyng on a tour of several states hard hit by the dry spell 
the president had planned several months ago to return to the 
station that launched his radio career woc in davenport iowa 
and he kept that appointment thursday joining station executives 
in marking its 65th anniversary of broadcasting 
but if the radio station appearance presented reagan with a 
nostaligic return to his early days of radio in the 1930s the 
witnessing of the droughts effects also evoked thoughts about that 
decade 
from montana to texas from california to georgia and right 
here in illinois farmers face the worst natural disaster since the 
dust bowl of the 1930s reagan told a group of state agriculture 
officials and farmers gathered at the du quoin state fairgrounds 
near here 
he voiced concern that a bipartisan farm aid program drafted by 
leaders of the congressional agricultural committee might become 
weighted down with specialinterest amendments 
lawmakers earlier this week unveiled a 55 billion plan that 
would provide payments of up to 100000 to keep farmers on their 
land despite the withering heat and lack of rain 
there may be some very fine amendments that belong on the 
bill reagan said but also every once in a while it becomes 
a christmas tree with people trying to attach things that really 
have no bearing on the main purpose 
im calling today for congress to act quickly on comprehensive 
drought relief for all farmers for all crops he said 
in an interview with woc reagan said he is waiting for the farm 
relief bill i will sign it the minte it is delivered to me he 
said 
the president touched on the bill again in a luncheon speech in 
davenport partisanship should be kept out of the issue of 
drought relief he said politics must stop at the parched 
fields edge 
at the conclusion of his speech the president was presented a 
framed replica of a special edition of the front page of the quad 
city times with photographs of him as a child of four in 1914 a 
football star in 1927 a highschool graduate in 1928 on a 
postcard in the late 1930s during his movie career as governor of 
california in 1967 and as president in 1988 
he quipped i was never as young as i am in some of those 
pictures 
the agriculture department said tuesday that the corn crop this 
year may be 29 percent less than expected a few months ago and 26 
percent below last years bumper harvest it said sharp reductions 
also are expected for 1988 wheat and soybean production 
after landing at williamson county airport near here reagan 
boarded his helicopter for a 25minute aerial inspection of the 
crop damage the president observed by reporters traveling in 
another helicopter flying in a loose formation with marine one 
could be seen looking out the window occasionally gesturing toward 
other passengers as he witnessed the devastation 
once on the ground he joined his farm hosts herman and richard 
krone for a walking tour of corn and soybean fields 
reagan a sixfooter towered over the corn stalks which 
reached just past his waist by this time of year they should have 
grown to eight feet 
he then crossed a dirt road and walked through a soybean field 
which ad many gaping spots where there was nothing but soil 
the situation on the ground im sorry to say is as bad as i 
expected the president said at the fairgrounds 
reagan said recent rains may have helped some but it hasnt 
solved the problem and for many farmers time has run out 
noting that 1973 counties in 38 states have qualified so far 
for federal emergency agricultural disaster relief aid he said 
we cant make it rain but we can help to ease the pain 
it will end it always has in the past reagan said but 
the question is when will it end and how much of the crop can be 
saved 
i wanted to let you know that we will do everything that we 
can he said 
reagan who doffed his suitcoat for the walking tour drank iced 
tea at a picnic table outside the krones farmhouse as he 
commiserated with the father and son about the crop damage they 
have suffered 
richard krone speaking just before reagan went to the mike at 
the fairgrounds said theres no one here looking for a handout 
these people here realize only so much can be done

the congressional watchdog agency was asked 
thursday to investigate complaints that the securities and exchange 
commission is restricting access to documents in its public 
reference room 
rep glenn english dokla chairman of the house government 
operations subcommittee on government information asked the 
general accounting office congress auditing wing to look into 
complaints about the commissions policy on how access is granted 
to its records on paper and on microfiche of publicly traded 
corporations 
users of the sec reference room have charged that new access 
regulations interfere with the publics right to know threaten to 
undermine investor protection restrict the ability to gather news 
about financial markets and provide de facto monopoly access to 
timely financial data to a single company english said in a 
statement 
mary mccue an sec spokeswoman said the agency keeps records on 
paper for 30 days after that records are kept on microfiche 
because over time the microfiche records have become disordered 
mccue said the agency decided last month to permit only sec 
employees to have access to those files 
reference room users now must fill out request forms for 
microfiche and the goal is to supply it within one to four hours 
she said there is still open access to paper records 
however pat clawson washington bureau chief of radio and 
records a weekly industry newspaper said much longer delays of 
eight hours or even several days are commonplace under the new 
policy compared with access within several minutes under the old 
policy 
these elongated time frames critically hamper newsgathering 
activities pressured by deadlines said clawson who is 
organizing opposition to the new policy 
the sec actions represent a clear and present danger to the 
publics right to know and threaten to undermine investor 
protection he said 
he also charged that in many cases bechtel information services 
a gaithersburg md firm which provides microfilming and copying 
services under contract with the sec has the first access to 
documents before the public reference room and before a press 
room which the sec maintains for news organizations 
bechtel also sells copies of documents and thus competes with 
about 23 other privately owned investor services which operate out 
of the public reference room 
because bechtel gets some documents first youve got the 
creation of a de facto monopoly here of the governments securities 
files clawson said 
mccue of the sec said the bechtel contract which is renewable 
annually was awarded competitively and the commission reviews the 
fees it charges to supply copies 
she also blamed employees of the investor services which 
compete against one another for misfiling and losing microfiche 
files she said the sec has been unable to increase its reference 
room staff even though the number of documents filed with the
