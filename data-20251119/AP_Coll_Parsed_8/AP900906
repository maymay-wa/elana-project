soldiers tightened their encirclement of 
armed mohawk warriors wednesday but federal officials met with 
indian leaders to try to end the confrontation 
about 400 soldiers have surrounded 20 mohawk warriors and 30 
women and children in a small wooded area bordered by a highway and 
a lake on the kahnesatake settlement near oka 18 miles west of 
montreal 
on wednesday the soldiers ringed the mohawk stronghold with 
razor wire and provincial police set up a floating barricade on 
the lake to prevent boats from entering or leaving the compound 
in ottawa native leaders met with federal indian affairs 
minister tom siddon and solicitor general pierre cadieux 
georges erasmus head of the assembly of first nations a major 
indian group said both the federal and quebec governments must get 
involved in a new round of negotiations to resolve the dispute 
erasmus urged the army to pull back from positions surrounding a 
detoxification center occupied by the mohawks 
what were concerned about is that an accident will happen or 
somebody will lose the control they have over themselves erasmus 
said then there will be the exchange of gunfire that nobody in 
this country wants 
quebec premier robert bourassa broke off negotiations last week 
and ordered the army in to remove barricades set up by mohawks near 
oka and on the mercier bridge over the st lawrence river linking 
montreal with its southern suburbs 
on wednesday night the quebec government announced that the 
mercier bridge would be reopened on thursday morning for the first 
time since july 11 when mohawks from the kahnawake reserve put up 
barricades in sympathy with the mohawks in oka 
the bridges closure caused angry and at times violent 
demonstrations by local residents who were forced to make long 
detours to travel to montreal 
the barricades came down last week after the army reached an 
agreement with the kahnawake mohawks 
but mohawks at the kahnesatake settlement refused to remove 
their barricades the army moved in over the weekend to dismantle 
the barricades and the indians retreated to the wooded area around 
the detoxification center 
members of the militant mohawk warriors society say they wont 
lay down their arms without a new policing arrangement that would 
curb the authority of the quebec provincial police in the 
settlement 
the mohawks fear reprisals for the death of a police officer 
killed july 11 in a failed police attempt to remove barricades put 
up in a dispute over plans by oka town officials to expand a golf 
course onto what the indians say is tribal land the clash sparked 
the 2monthold armed standoff 
the dispute over the golf course expansion was solved when the 
federal government purchased the land and said it would give it to 
the indians but the mohawks have raised a wider range of 
grievances including demands for sovereignty 
also wednesday the army decided it will no longer allow food or 
supplies such as film to reach 15 journalists still inside the 
kahnesatake compound mohawks however are allowed to bring in 
food 
the army said if the journalists decide to leave they wont be 
allowed back in 
when asked why army spokesman capt yvon desjardins said 
its for their own security they would be more secure if 
they left

scientists said today they had cloned a gene 
that helps brain cells communicate a step that may someday help in 
treating schizophrenia parkinsons disease and other brain 
disorders 
the gene tells brain cells how to make a structure called a 
dopamine receptor which receives a chemical messenger called 
dopamine that brain cells send one another 
hyperactivity in this communication system may cause at least 
some schizophrenia symptoms and evidence suggests the 
hyperactivity may result from abnormalities in dopamine receptors 
commented dr lewis judd director of the national institute of 
mental health 
the discovery will aid research into identifying receptor 
abnormalities and the effect they have on brain cells judd said 
the gene is for the socalled d1 dopamine receptor the gene for 
the other major kind of dopamine receptor called d2 was cloned in 
1988 
the new work is reported in todays issue of the british journal 
nature by three teams of scientists 
the finding may someday let doctors diagnose schizophrenia and 
parkinsons before symptoms appear by identifying receptor 
abnormalities said allen dearry a member of one of the research 
teams 
that could allow earlier treatment with greater chance of 
success he said 
parkinsons is a potentially disabling condition that can 
include tremors rigidity and gradual loss of spontaneous movement 
further work may also pave the way for better drugs to treat 
psychosis the loss of touch with reality seen in schizophrenia 
said dearry of the duke university medical center in durham nc 
scientists may be able to distinguish variants of the receptor 
and design drugs to act only on those variants that affect 
psychosis while avoiding variants that produce side effects he 
said 
most current standard antipsychosis drugs include a risk of 
such side effects as tardive dyskinesia a syndrome of involuntary 
movements that can affect the mouth tongue arms leg or trunk 
dearrys group included scientists at duke and the howard hughes 
medical institute laboratories there 
another group reporting the gene cloning is from the oregon 
health sciences university in portland and the third group is from 
the university of toronto ontario canada the national institute 
of neurological disorders and stroke in bethesda md the yale 
university school of medicine the hospital for sick children in 
toronto and the addiction research foundation in toronto

nasa says magellans 744 million 
mission to map the rugged surface of venus will begin later this 
month even if engineers cant figure out why they twice lost radio 
contact with the spacecraft 
were not willing to wait to understand what happened 
magellan experiment representative steve wall at nasas jet 
propulsion laboratory said wednesday 
magellan went into orbit around venus on aug 10 after a 
looping 948millionmile trip that began when the spacecraft was 
launched from the shuttle atlantis 16 months ago 
magellan made its first pictures of venus during an aug 16 test 
but lost touch with earth that night for 14 hours and lost contact 
again for 17 hours starting aug 21 
engineers will continue trying to determine the cause of the 
failures but computer commands being sent to magellan should 
enable engineers to restore contact quickly if it is lost again 
wall said 
magellan is designed to use radar to peer through venus thick 
clouds and make the most detailed maps and pictures yet of the 
planets deformed surface the communications trouble delayed the 
start of mapping last week 
officials expect to start the mapping sometime late this month 
wall said 
magellan and venus are about 153 million miles from earth 
the spaceships initial pictures showed long faults other areas 
crisscrossed by many faults in a pattern resembling broken 
automobile safety glass solidified lava flows volcanic cinder 
cones meteorite impact craters and extensive valleys and ridges

a 10foothigh concrete barrier separates 
the elite from the masses on the beach of this black sea resort 
illustrating the soviet unions failure to achieve a classless 
society 
the wall starts in the water and runs over the sand to separate 
the riviera a public beach from a vast playground reserved for 
those with position and influence 
no one seems to know the name of the private beach or the names 
of those who use it little is known of the services provided but 
the sheer size of the sanctum raises eyebrows 
on an average day 15000 people must crowd onto a public beach 
only 750 yards long while about 500 of the upper crust loll on an 
expanse that stretches more than half a mile 
arkady melkonyan a state television correspondent cited the 
figures in a recent broadcast 
like melkonyan some citizens are indignant others shrug it off 
the martians live differently than we why shouldnt they 
valery skripnik a 40yearold gardener said on the riviera beach 
he spoke between chinups on an exercise bar 
there is increasing criticism of reserving beaches quality 
medical care luxury apartments special planes and stores for 
communist party and government officials in a country where 
ordinary people live in cramped housing and stand in line for food 
and other necessities 
some politicians most notably boris yeltsin president of the 
russian republic have won wide popular support by attacking 
privilege 
dozens of country homes have been converted from private 
residences for the elite to public rest homes the newspaper 
rabochaya tribuna reported aug 8 that the number of aircraft 
reserved for the privileged had been drastically reduced 
those who are more equal than others have a strong grip on 
sochi however and few of its facilities have gone public 
melkonyan told viewers that of the resort areas 151 beaches only 
22 were open to ordinary people 
in addition to the reserved beaches sochi has elaborate private 
resort complexes known in russian as sanatoriums they do not 
appear on maps are generally visible only from the sea and are 
heavily guarded 
down the beach from the actors sanatorium and pravda 
sanatorium spas for actors and journalists is the dzerzhinsky 
sanatorium the summer hideaway of kgb agents named for felix 
dzerzhinsky who founded the soviet secret police 
it begins at the seaside with a covered patio adorned with tall 
ornate yellow arches and white columns an elevator takes 
vacationers up a hill to a main building tucked into a thickly 
wooded area 
exclusive beachfront facilities nearby include a small yellow 
villa with white arches that was favored by lavrenti beria 
dictator josef stalins chief of secret police 
farther along the black sea coast are the dachas as the villas 
are called of president mikhail s gorbachev premier nikolai i 
ryzhkov and anatoly i lukyanov 
at least two resorts have been partly opened to the public after 
decades of catering to the elite 
the 180acre green grove resort once reserved for communist 
party officials received automotive workers from gorky and 
steelworkers from magnitogorsk last year director ludmilla 
voblikova reported 
staffs of communist party schools from janitors to instructors 
spend vacations at the complex on a wooded hill overlooking the sea 
voblikova has run the place since 1958 when privilege was not 
questioned she proclaimed allegiance to the new policy but said 
i think we should all work well and the better we work the 
better we should live 
at nearby lenin sanitorium the splendor formerly saved for 
communist party officials now is available to workers from 
collective farms 
they live in a gray marble dormitory built in 1984 that has 
clean carpeted wellfurnished rooms 
an older building erected in the 1950s has an italian 
courtyard with colored tile white columns and an ornate 
fountain in the main dining room are glass chandeliers white 
marble columns and parquet floors

so you think its been a hot summer 
where you live pity the folks in nebraska where its been so hot 
farmers have had to feed their chickens cracked ice to keep them 
from laying hardboiled eggs 
talk about hot an iowa farmer says the sun was so intense one 
day his cornfield exploded into fluffy white clouds of popcorn his 
cattle thought it was snowing and froze solid on the spot 
sure everyone complains about the weather but one man has 
finally done something about it 
fred pfister an english professor at college of the ozarks in 
point lookout has compiled a list of tall weather tales he calls 
them weather windies that hes heard on his travels around 
the country 
pfister a native of missouris ozarks began jotting down 
outrageous weather sayings just for kicks about 20 years ago 
he spins the best of the 50 or 60 weather windies in his repertoire 
at speaking engagements around the region 
when youre from the hills and youre out in the flatlands 
the natives like to pull your leg a little bit he said people 
always exaggerate about the weather 
pfisters found that to be especially true in the midwest 
it seems as if everybody in the midwest likes to think that 
their weather is unique he said i suppose it is in a way i 
dont think people on the east and west coasts need to worry as 
much about tornadoes as they do in the midwest 
talking about the weather is always a good way to jumpstart a 
conversation pfister said 
im not sure why people like to talk about the weather he 
said maybe its a neutral subject youre not going to offend 
anyone if you talk about the weather youre not going to seem nosy 
or anything 
pfister says he enjoys playing the straight man for oldtimers 
gas station attendants store clerks or anyone else who can add to 
his collection of weather windies 
an arkansan transplanted in texas once told pfister that 
comfortable summer days in dallas are as rare as rockinghorse 
manure 
i love that one he said 
the same nebraskan who told pfister the story about feeding ice 
to chickens complained that rivers had gotten so dry catfish were 
coming up to homes to beg a drink of water 
a north dakota native claimed it gets so cold in his state in 
winter that words freeze in peoples mouths and they have to wait 
until spring to find out what everyones been talking about 
an oklahoman swears that the wind blows so hard in the sooner 
state that there was a calm day once and everyone fell down 
and south dakotans and minnesotans alike gripe that their states 
have nine months of winter and three months of bad sledding 
all these sayings dont do you any good but theyre kind of 
nice things to know at parties pfister quipped

before she died in january dorothea allen 
destroyed family papers and letters and tore the date and place of 
birth from her passport she left more than 28 million in cash 
no traceable next of kin no will no birth certificate no 
marriage certificate and a growing list of claimants to her 
fortune 
so far 31 people have come forward claiming to be heirs of the 
woman known in british newspapers as the vanishing lady 
by law claimants have 12 years to prove they are blood 
relatives if they fail the fortune goes to the state treasury 
treasury lawyers ordered the sale of her effects including mink 
coats a 1972 rollsroyce corniche and a 1964 daimler jewelry 
paintings furniture silver and other trappings from a glamorous 
past that by some accounts included a trip across the dance floor 
with fred astaire 
the sale conducted tuesday by sothebys at her 300yearold 
home added 108 million cash to the estate the home itself in 
the village of suttonunderbrailes 90 miles northwest of london 
is expected to fetch another 13 million when it is sold 
according to sothebys the latest claimant to come forward is 
wilfried kluber from badenbaden west germany who says his 
grandmother was mrs allens sister 
kluber told sothebys that his grandmothers maiden name was 
farquharson and that mrs allen was born in 1901 his letter has 
been passed along to the treasury sothebys said 
the times of london said another claimant is merilyn horton of 
cleveland ohio it reported that mrs horton says her 
greatgrandfather was a scottish immigrant named farquharson 
chris proudlove of sothebys said that after a crash in her 
chauffeurdriven rollsroyce in the early 1980s mrs allen became 
a recluse in her home sutton brailes manor 
her husband eric allen died in 1965 news reports said the 
fortune came from a corset factory they set up in 1927 in nearby 
banbury 
she deliberately tried to obliterate her past i think she 
was of lowly birth married into money but had a business head on 
her shoulders i think she wanted to be remembered as the rich lady 
of the manor proudlove said 
the times said other reported theories were that she was a 
halfbelgian exnun an american cabaret dancer or even allens 
sister but the independent said former employees and neighbors 
scoffed at rumors of an incestuous marriage 
the times quoted john lee of the treasury lawyers office as 
saying so far we only have a passport indicating a maiden name 
of farquharson but the details of date and place of birth have 
been destroyed 
hoping to solve the mystery sothebys on aug 24 organized a 
tea party on the lawn at sutton brailes manor for former staff 
she destroyed her past so successfully i dont think anybody 
will ever discover the real truth said leslie stratford 82 who 
was her accountant 
muriel keyte 73 who was also at the tea party said tuesday 
that she was allens only child by his first marriage she believed 
his second marriage to dorothea was bigamous 
the daily telegraph on wednesday quoted unidentified former 
employees as saying mrs allen was a factory worker who eloped with 
allen after he abandoned his wife and children 
news reports said that in the 1930s the couple enjoyed a 
champagne lifestyle with luxury apartments in london a beachfront 
estate in barbados as well as sutton brailes manor 
among the stories of their past none of them verified were 
tales of her dancing with astaire on one of the couples frequent 
visits to paris 
in her old age servants recalled she used to call for a cup of 
tea by setting off the burglar alarm

the 15 chiefs of us corporations going to 
the soviet union this weekend with commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher plan to offer american knowhow on such fundamental items 
as efficient housing and transporting goods 
its kind of back to the basics you walk up a stairway in 
a soviet building and none of the steps are the same they cant 
even finish a floor flat things you and i take for granted said 
mark hungerford chairman and chief executive officer of tanscisco 
industries inc of san francisco a rail car company 
they can get rockets to the moon so its not like theyre 
incapable but theyve never focused on these things before 
hungerford said 
he is one of 15 chief executive officers of us companies 
scheduled to leave for moscow on saturday for a weeklong visit to 
discuss what kind of technical assistance the united states can 
give the soviet union 
mosbacher and the business leaders are set to leave on the eve 
of president bushs summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev the administration said wednesday that it would take a 
fresh look at economic aid for the soviet union in light of 
moscows real and very helpful support in the persian gulf 
at the economic summit of industrial nations in houston last 
july the administration balked at providing the soviet union with 
cash grants or loans but agreed to provide the technical assistance 
about 80 other nations receive american technical assistance 
which can range from developing a flyresistant wheat in morocco to 
bringing down bangladeshs fertility rate 
the soviets need help with improving their transportation 
systems and housing said business leaders who will make the trip 
several officers of us oil companies are also accompanying 
mosbacher 
big chunks of money are not what they want they want to have 
the exposure to the management techniques and construction 
techniques and operating techniques that we take for granted 
hungerford said 
hungerfords company for example is engaged in a joint venture 
with the soviets to help them with a heating system for tank rail 
cars that performs well in cold climates his firm also is helping 
the soviets improve their transportation of petrochemical products 
another transportation company sealand service inc of 
edison nj will be represented by its chief executive alex j 
mandl sealand specializes in global distribution networks 
mandl said the trip gives him a chance to help both bush and his 
company 
that part of the world is opening up as long as the iron 
curtain was up our distribution network did not participate in 
that part of the world as that wall comes down we have a chance 
to be in there mandl said 
leonard sylk chairman and chief executive officer of shelter 
systems group of hainesport nj said the soviets have been 
interested in his firms expertise because it makes manufactured 
housing components they are the roofs floors and walls that 
largescale builders use in putting up houses 
the soviets have voiced interest in using wood for housing as 
in the united states rather than the concrete and cinder blocks 
now used sylk said 
us businesses stand to gain if the soviet economy improves 
the executives said 
its in our interest as a nation to help them at least get 
into the last part of the 20th century they say to make peace is 
to make prosperity and vice versa hungerford said 
other companies to be represented on the trip are according to 
government sources are 
archerdanielsmidland co of decatur ill atlantic richfield 
co of los angeles chevron corp of san francisco dresser 
industries of dallas fortune magazine of new york glenair 
international of del mar calif 
also the louisiana land and exploration co of new orleans 
painewebber of new york pepsico inc of purchase ny pruet oil

forthright steely and calm foreign secretary 
douglas hurd is playing the central role in britains involvement 
in the persian gulf crisis like an old hand 
prime minister margaret thatcher who appointed hurd less than a 
year ago has been content for the most part to let him speak for 
the government a role she had usually reserved for herself 
appearing daily on british television newscasts hurd turns up 
in capitals from london to riyadh stylishly berating saddam 
hussein talking of giving sanctions a chance while preparing for 
war and prodding iraq to release western hostages 
this is a catandmouse game now a little mercy now some 
more ruthlessness hurd said after the iraqi president tousling 
the hair of a 5yearold british hostage said he would let women 
and children go and of course its quite unacceptable 
hurd 60 began his working life as a diplomat then turned to 
politics and writing he is probably the first british foreign 
secretary whose qualifications include fluency in mandarin chinese 
hurd was appointed in october just three months after the 
humiliation of having his previous post as home secretary offered 
to others in a cabinet shuffle 
hurd appeared a safe choice for the foreign office post for 
him it was the fulfillment of an ambition cherished through a long 
political career 
some analysts predicted trouble between the patriciansounding 
hurd and mrs thatcher who is traditionally suspicious of the 
foreign office with its uppercrust style and its instincts for 
compromise and conciliation 
but for the first time since she led the conservative party back 
to power in 1979 mrs thatcher is letting someone else is do most 
of the talking in a crisis 
commented the proconservative daily telegraph hurd simply 
conveys a strong sense of unvarnished quality which avoids slipping 
over into dullness 
hurd is an oldfashioned tory from the paternalistic benign 
centerleft wing of the party that mrs thatcher overthrew in 1975 
the son and grandson of conservative members of parliament hurd 
was educated at eton and cambridge where he took a firstclass 
honors degree in history he joined the diplomatic service in 1952 
while posted in rome he wrote the first of five published 
thrillers 
at the age of 36 hurd quit a fastmoving diplomatic career for 
politics for six years he was political secretary to edward heath 
the man mrs thatcher ousted as party leader in 1975 
mrs thatcher gave him his first cabinet job as northern 
ireland secretary a decade later 
as foreign secretary hurd appears to have succeeded in locking 
mrs thatcher into a commitment to link the pound to other european 
currencies and to have generally oiled britains often prickly 
relations with the rest of the european community 
only five years younger than mrs thatcher hurd seemed to have 
reached his political zenith before the gulf crisis 
he has talked of spending more time with his wife judith his 
former secretary whom he married after a 1982 divorce and their 
two small children there are three adults sons by the first 
marriage 
his name is also mentioned as a serious contender to succeed 
mrs thatcher 
the speculation does not hurt a politician who unlike some of 
mrs thatchers prominent aides manages to be loyal without 
appearing cowed 
she likes an argument hurd said recently of mrs thatcher 
some people find it difficult to argue with a woman prime 
minister so they rather tend to shrivel up and feel resentful the 
answer is actually to argue back youll find yourself being 
contradicted and sometimes told you dont know what you are talking 
about but if you persevere you gain ground

un sanctions enforced by american 
warships are chipping away at iraqs warhardened economy but some 
western analysts fear it could take a year to force any real 
concessions 
time could be an ally for iraqi president saddam hussein who is 
constantly probing for weak links that will enable him to break the 
embargo and the international solidarity behind it 
the sanctions imposed after iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 are 
beginning to bite in baghdad however iraq now rations some basic 
foods there are shortages and growing bread lines some with 
hundreds of people waiting more than four hours 
western diplomats say iraq can survive for months and perhaps 
indefinitely on its own food stockpiles and production from this 
years expected bumber crop yields 
the embargo on food is wishful thinking on the part of the 
west said one diplomat who like others spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
the iraqis he said are resilient people pragmatic and 
accustomed to hardships after eight years of war with iran 
they could effectively feed themselves on a basic level 
indefinitely the senior diplomat said 
another western diplomat agreed saying iraq has enough food to 
comfortably survive for three months perhaps more 
the real bite of sanctions they say will be felt in the 
hightech industry and infrastructure of this nation which has 
relied on western technology and expertise 
its hard to see how all these industrial items they are used 
to can get in the senior diplomat said one can imagine the 
whole 20th century economy of this place is collapsing or about to 
collapse 
iraq relies on imports spare parts and components no longer 
available because of the sanctions 
one european diplomat noted some areas have experienced brief 
power cuts perhaps a sign of some technical problems in iraqi 
generating capacity 
the statecontrolled media has advised people to conserve 
fuel we take that as evidence of official worry about how the 
refineries are holding out he said 
still diplomats predict the embargo will take months to cripple 
the country 
it may be a year before it hurts saddam hussein enough to make 
concessions said one 
some western diplomats also fear that saddam will persuade poor 
weaker countries to abandon the sanctions 
he has been successful a diplomat said there are certain 
countries that are weaker that cannot resist the situation the 
blackmail the hostages the promises of future deals he refused 
to identify the countries 
the diplomats said the level of the sanctionsbusting is 
insignificant so far and that the economic blockade will be 
effective if maintained 
export sanctions are very effective i cant imagine them 
flying out planeloads of crude oil the senior diplomat said 
iraqs creditworthiness is near zero the money is running out 
private contractors said they have shut down or mothballed 
projects in iraq and that many companies may be reluctant to come 
back some of their workers have been detained by the iraqis for 
violating their contracts 
many foreign workers who perform menial tasks also have fled 
and piles of garbage now litter some neighborhoods one iraqi said 
it was an unusual sight caused by the exodus of egyptian workers 
some iraqis say they believe shortages caused by the sanctions 
especially food lines could lead to street violence 
but diplomats here discount any hope that saddam will be toppled 
by a popular revolt 
opposition is just wishful thinking one said there is no 
opposition in iraq 
saddams portrait smiles down from buildings and billboards all 
over the city his name is attached to everything from monuments to 
the airport 
dissent is crushed ruthlessly and the statecontrolled media 
hails the achievements of the president portraying him as the 
leader of the arab masses who has defied the superpowers 
the propaganda machine works perfectly in this country said 
one western diplomat it is like the soviet union under stalin in 
the 1930s the people genuinely believe the propaganda 
they believe it in their hearts said another 
saddam they argue is strong firmly in control and enjoying 
the genuine support of at least half the population 
while desperately seeking for ways to break the sanctions 
government ministries are working overtime looking for ways to 
increase production of essentials 
the government is making loans to farmers and providing 
fertilizer free of charge one diplomat said 
it has instituted rationing one said to play up the dramatic 
effects of the embargo as well as to conserve food and to guarantee 
a constant if reduced flow of some foods 
rationing appeals to the soft hearts of other countries the 
diplomat said 
but the senior diplomat noted the un sanctions permit the 
delivery of food and medicine when necessary and he doubted they 
would become the biggest weapons of the embargo 
when people start dying who will deny them food or medicine 
will president bush be able to deny it to a dying child he asked

temperatures soar during daytime and plunge after dark 
airlifts will continue as long as necessary norman said the 
new canaanbased agency also might help fly the refugees home 
we are not normally peopleferriers he said but if we 
can arrange for access to help people get out and if people think 
its appropriate i think we might extend our relief effort in that 
area as well 
asian refugees were pouring into jordan at a rate of 10000 a 
day relief officials said tuesday adding the number could reach 1 
million within a week or two more than 420000 refugees have

bread one tomato and one cucumber per person americares said 
the organization would send nonperishable food such as wafers 
nutrition bars and survivaltype packaged food norman said 
the red cross said overcrowding of refugees was a major concern 
the international red cross has been working in jordan for the 
past two weeks and according to relief workers the conditions for 
the new arrivals are deteriorating said steve richards 
executive vice president of the american red cross it is urgent 
that the refugees be evacuated away from the border area as soon as 
possible 
the organization said some refugees have had little water food 
and shelter for periods of up to three days the red cross 
chartered planes to fly into amman jordan carrying milk 
babyfood food for adults familysize tents and other survival

the international red cross to jordanian red crescent refugee 
relief programs to 350 tons officials said 
on tuesday jordans crown prince hassan criticized the 
international community for not doing enough 
i dont think we had any idea of how we would do it without 
the cooperation of the jordanians and i think until recently 
they really werent communicating with anyone norman said 
the international aid group operation usa appealed wednesday for 
money and bulk donations of food medicine and shelters for the 
refugees citizens of bangladesh india pakistan sri lanka the

pope john paul ii visiting a region 
ravaged by aids has declared that the disease is a moral issue 
that calls for changes in sexual behavior 
the pope who traveled to this tiny mountainous country on the 
fifth day of a 10day african trip said aids is a pandemic which 
must not be treated solely as a medical problem he stressed its 
implications of a moral and anthropological character 
the epidemic differs from so many others that humanity has 
known in that specific human behavior plays a role in its spread 
john paul said in the speech wednesday to burundis bishops it 
is linked directly or not to the transmission of life and love 
the first big landmark on the popes drive from the airport to 
the city was a 90footwide sign warning against the dangers of 
aids spread by permissive sex in polygamous african societies 
the burundi society like many others in the world is exposed 
to a grave danger the pope said i am talking about the 
pandemic of aids which afflicts a number of your compatriots 
especially young adults and it is painful to state it little 
children 
john paul said aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
poses major challenges for the church such as informing and 
educating people about the disease while making sure the problem 
is not treated at the expense of the moral ethic 
he said the church has a duty to assist aids sufferers not only 
with health care but with psychological and spiritual 
assistance for those with an acute form of the illness and those 
who carry the virus 
these people often tend to close themselves in an anguished 
silence he said they need a fraternal presence to give them 
the courage to accept their condition 
it was the second time the pope has spoken about the deadly 
disease during his fournation african tour in tanzania last week 
he called for a global effort to combat the disease and reaffirmed 
the churchs rejection of the use of condoms as a means to check 
the spread of aids 
the world health organization estimates that 5 million africans 
are infected with the virus that can cause aids 
aids is most often transmitted through sexual contact the virus 
attacks the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to a 
wide variety of infections and cancers 
john paul began his threeday visit to burundi by urging 
forgiveness and reconciliation in this country with a long history 
of tribal warfare he flew to the country on wednesday from 
tanzania 
the pope on his seventh visit to africa will also travel to to 
rwanda and the ivory coast where he will end his tour monday by 
consecrating the massive basilica of our lady of peace

white house and congressional budget 
negotiators have agreed on almost nothing during three contentious 
months of bargaining and now that they are about to resume 
discussions saddam hussein has made the job even harder 
iraqs conquest of oilrich kuwait has meant higher fuel costs 
and that has threatened to further slow the already sputtering us 
economy dispatching american troops to saudi arabia has driven up 
pentagon spending 
those changed economic and political circumstances will 
complicate efforts to shrink the federal deficit when 
administration officials and congressional leaders resume budget 
talks on friday 
in preparation house democrats and republicans held separate 
budget sessions wednesday and planned additional sessions today 
were working on a democratic plan house majority leader 
richard gephardt dmo tersely told reporters when he emerged 
from a lengthy afternoon session 
white house budget director richard darman met with republican 
lawmakers meantime darman said little about that meeting but 
expressed concern that the redink problem will be further 
complicated by the costs of the persian gulf operation and the 
slowing us economy 
the budget talks broke off five weeks ago for congress august 
recess 
the world we left aug 4 is not the same as the world well 
see on sept 7 said rep newt gingrich rga one of the 
negotiators 
yet the bargainers have precious little time left to work out a 
budget deal the new fiscal year starts oct 1 unless a pact is 
enacted the grammrudman deficitreduction law will trigger more 
than 100 billion in spending cuts to most federal programs a 
staggering amount that day 
with that in mind the negotiators goal is to work out a 
package of tax increases and spending cuts by monday their 
sessions at andrews air force base in suburban maryland may be 
so lengthy that bargainers say they may sleep overnight at the base 
to give themselves more working time 
sometimes the will for a solution comes collectively when you 
know youre down to the short strokes said another participant 
sen bob packwood rore 
before the talks recessed bargainers had reached a consensus on 
one thing the need for a package that saves about 50 billion next 
year and 500 billion over five years 
now negotiators disagree over how much savings are desirable 
it is possible they will settle for a smaller plan particularly 
for next year 
some lawmakers say they want to stick to the initial 50 
billion500 billion formula they argue that with a limp economy 
there is more reason than ever to take a substantial whack at the 
budget gap which could be a record 230 billion or more next year 
unless something is done 
we have to make a decision about whether a deficitreduction 
package is important to this country said house budget committee 
chairman leon panetta dcalif i still think it is 
others say reductions in the range of 30 billion to 40 billion 
may be preferable for next year because the weak economy shouldnt 
be shocked by even deeper cuts 
you dont need a phd in economics to figure out if you have 
slow economic growth and you cut 50 billion out of the economy at 
that point what you do is go right into the hole youve been 
slipping into said william gray of pennsylvania the 
thirdranking house democrat 
administration officials said as recently as tuesday that they 
still think 50 billion in savings is the best goal for next year 
although they are willing to listen to proposals for smaller 
targets 
lawmakers who have spoken to white house aides say that could 
drop to perhaps 35 billion 
the iraqi invasion has also caused bargainers to look 
differently at some likely components of a deficitcutting package 
higher oil prices will make it harder for the negotiators to 
agree to new energy taxes which before august seemed a likely part 
of any compromise 
the showdown in the gulf has also provided new ammunition to 
opponents of deep defense cuts some republicans say the 
confrontation with iraq shows that the military must remain strong 
despite the waning of the cold war 
democrats who have been looking for pentagon reductions in the 
9 billion to 16 billion range counter that any additional 
defense spending needed in the middle east can be more than 
compensated for by cuts in us military expenditures in europe 
despite their divisions bargainers say they are guardedly 
optimistic that they will make a deal 
with the combination of the military and economic crisis and 
the budget crisis and the sequester grammrudman spending cuts 
the members of this summit are going to feel they cant just walk 
out i hope said panetta

an elderly italian man is being plucked from 
45 years of obscurity to be toasted at a blacktie dinner as an 
unsung world war ii hero who rescued thousands of hungarian jews 
from death in the holocaust 
unlike raoul wallenberg the celebrated swedish diplomat who 
saved tens of thousands of jews in wartime budapest retired 
businessman giorgio perlasca and his perilous exploits were 
virtually unknown in the united states until very recently 
tonight all that will change hundreds of italianamericans 
will gather to watch perlasca 80 receive the medal of remembrance 
from the us holocaust memorial council the council a federal 
agency is overseeing construction of a privately financed 147 
million holocaust museum near the national mall 
perlasca who made his first trip to the united states from his 
modest home in padua italy for the occasion will receive the 
medal from supreme court justice antonin scalia 
he is the first recipient of the award established to honor 
individuals who displayed extraordinary heroism and acts of courage 
during the holocaust in which 6 million jews were slaughtered by 
nazi germany 
in this sea of darkness there were flickers of light from a 
few people said miles lerman the councils chairman for 
international relations who learned of perlasca during a visit to 
budapest last year 
there werent many who cared to step forward while other good 
people stood idly by and did nothing lerman said but their 
choices made the difference between life and death in the total 
darkness of cruelty and indifference they found that goodness has 
a power of its own and they became beacons of light who redeemed 
mankind 
perlasca who dislikes publicity and dismisses any mention of 
his personal heroism speaks modestly of his wartime mission of 
mercy others would have done the same he said 
i always say the opportunity makes a thief perlasca said 
speaking through an interpreter my opportunity was there and i 
took it maybe those who remained silent didnt have the 
opportunity 
during the three months from october 1944 until soviet troops 
liberated budapest in january 1945 perlasca masqueraded as a 
spanish diplomat and arranged safe haven for an estimated 5200 
jews who had been given phony letters of protection by the 
spanish legation in the hungarian capital 
some experts say perlasca was responsible for saving more than 
10000 jews most of them women children and the elderly from 
certain death by hungarian nazi thugs until soviet liberators 
arrived 
perlasca was the budapest representative of an importexport 
company in rome that supplied meat to the italian army when 
dictator benito mussolini was overthrown in 1943 and italy 
abandoned its alliance with nazi germany perlasca sought 
protection from reprisals by obtaining a diplomatic passport from 
the spanish legation 
the spanish were friendly to perlasca because he had fought with 
francisco francos forces in the spanish civil war later when the 
spanish minister fled to switzerland perlasca convinced hungarian 
officials that he was the legal representative of spain in budapest 
perlasca then 34 was appalled at the sight of jews being shot 
beaten and herded aboard cattle cars at the budapest train station 
for deportation to german death camps 
so much agony reinforced in me the will to do as much as 
possible to help those unfortunate people he later told a 
hungarian writer the cattle loaded by my company were 
treated better than the deportees 
repeatedly perlasca harangued senior hungarian officials to 
assure the safety of jews crowded into the sanctuary of apartment 
houses flying the spanish flag and personally rescued jews who had 
been arrested in violation of agreements 
he spent his dwindling funds to buy scraps of meat powdered 
eggs and other scarce foods and delivered them to the starving 
inhabitants of his safe houses in the spanish diplomats black 
limousine 
perlasca vividly recalled snatching twin children from a throng 
of jewish deportees at the budapest train station and hustling them 
to safety in the spanish limousine i thought to myself why do 
these two have to go to die he said 
when a gestapo major tried to pull the children from the car at 
gunpoint perlasca physically barred him at the door claiming 
diplomatic immunity the confrontation escalated with perlascas 
friend wallenberg joining the argument along with representatives 
of other neutral countries the vatican and the international red 
cross 
a german colonel intervened the major explained the situation 
let them go their time will come too the colonel said the 
germans walked away and perlasca kept the twins 
perlasca asked wallenberg who the colonel was wallenberg 
surprised replied that he was adolf eichmann 
eichmann the nazi engineer of the holocaust was captured by 
israeli agents in 1960 and convicted by a jerusalem court of crimes 
against humanity he was hanged in 1962 
his time came too perlasca said

for more than a year republicans looked 
forward eagerly to taking on rep roy dyson in the november general 
election 
now they are not so sure that the maryland democrat will make it 
that far 
a recent revelation that the hawkish congressman was a 
conscientious objector during the vietnam war has leaders of both 
political parties speculating that he might not survive the primary 
election next tuesday 
dyson is still seen as the favorite but for the first time 
there is talk among political leaders in the 1st district that 
state legislator barbara kreamer his chief democratic opponent 
has an outside chance of winning 
if she has any money to make a major blitz on television this 
weekend its going to be a lot closer than anyone thought said 
joyce terhes state republican chairwoman 
a top democratic official who asked not to be named said the 
furor over dysons draft status and kreamers prochoice views on 
abortion give her an outside chance of pulling off an upset 
the problem for the democratic party is if dyson wins now he 
loses in november said the party leader who considers kreamer a 
stronger candidate 
not all democrats are that pessimistic there is agreement 
however that republicans have a good chance of reclaiming the seat 
they lost to dyson in 1980 
the incumbents problems extend beyond his draft status 
they began in 1988 with the disclosures that the federal 
election commission was investigating contributions made to him and 
other members of congress by defense lobbyists 
joseph e hill a consultant for unisys corp later pleaded 
guilty to donating unisys money to dyson and other officials and 
disguising the contributions as personal donations dyson said he 
did not know the gifts came from corporate funds 
just before the may primary election in 1988 dysons campaign 
was rocked again by the suicide of his top aide tom pappas pappas 
jumped to his death from a new york hotel the day the washington 
post reported that he recruited single young men for the 
congressmans staff and demanded that they spend off hours 
socializing with him and other staff members 
the national republican congressional committee targeted dyson 
for defeat this year the committee said its polls indicate he is 
one of the most vulnerable members of congress seeking reelection 
that vulnerability enticed eight republicans and three other 
democrats to enter the 1st district race this year 
just as it appeared dyson had put his problems behind him the 
story broke about his draft status 
he disclosed in a news release last week that he had been a 
conscientious objector the release was issued the day after the 
washington post sought an interview to discuss his draft records 
i opposed the war in vietnam dyson said by way of 
explanation 
i was a conscientious objector because i believed it was wrong 
to draft young men and send them to die in the jungles of southeast 
asia 
as a member of the house armed services committee dyson is a 
strong supporter of pentagon budget requests 
he backed the panama invasion and thinks us troops should be 
used to fight drug wars in south america 
after the iraqi invasion of kuwait dyson said president bush 
should preposition troops right in the middle of downtown 
baghdad 
his hawkish stand on defense coupled with his conscientious 
objector status brought charges of hypocrisy from his opponents 
he obviously is a hypocrite in this matter hiding from the 
draft and at the same time urging that we position our boys in 
the streets of baghdad said mark frazer one of his republican 
opponents 
the disclosure provided an instant boost to kreamers campaign 
theres definitely been a sea change in the last week said 
bob deweese kreamers campaign manager 
checks are coming in that we didnt expect to get thats 
going to help us get the message out on television and the radio 
he said 
no single favorite has emerged from the crowded republican field 
seven of the eight candidates are campaigning actively for the 
15000 to 20000 votes likely to be cast in the republican primary 
one of them state delegate richard colburn believes kreamer 
would be an easier target in the mostly conservative 1st district 
with roy it would be conservative vs conservative in 
november with barbara you would have a liberal democrat running 
against a conservative republican colburn said

the uss taylor was 
tracing its usual boxpattern patrol course in the central persian 
gulf when the tanker heavily laden and low in the water appeared 
on the horizon outbound 
this is an american warship please identify yourself your 
cargo and port of origin came the radio challenge 
a voice identified the tanker as the greekregistered 
fortuneship l carrying oil from jubail saudi arabia 
thank you said the taylor wishing a good day to the 
battered vessel that once survived three iraqi rocket attacks 
aug 30 nov 11 and nov 12 1987 while under charter to iran 
during its war with iraq 
after two sister frigates uss reid and uss robert g bradley 
fired warning shots at a pair of iraqi tankers on aug 18 the 
taylor was involved in shadowing one of the tankers out of the gulf 
otherwise in a month of operating mainly in the central gulf 
the charleston scbased missile frigate has yet to encounter its 
first iraqi tanker or cargo vessel 
we have been talking with every ship that comes through our 
section every single one has been cooperative and polite said 
the taylors skipper cmdr kevin p green of summerville sc 
the 3900ton taylor is one of 11 us warships operating in the 
gulf helping to enforce the unordered economic blockade of 
baghdad 
having arrived in july for a threemonth tour with the middle 
east force the navys gulfbased patrol unit it was already on 
station when iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 
we were on a routine deployment all the excitement developed 
after we were here said green even so he said the iraqi 
invasion really changed very little for his crew 
in training exercises said green we go through just about 
every conceivable contingency practice with all the weapons 
systems and are prepared for precisely this type of situation 
the taylors patrol assignment makes it one of the first us 
warships that would encounter iraqi tankers or other vessels headed 
south from iraq or kuwait green said 
it also means ships coming up the gulf have usually already been 
cleared by other ships before they reach the taylors area 
iraq is convinced that we mean what we say green said i 
am sure theyre convinced we know what were doing out here 
although the taylor is at readiness condition three one 
notch below battle stations the atmosphere is relaxed sailors 
jog and work out with weights on the upper deck 
lt steve davis the taylors combat systems officer 
acknowledged the relative comfort the ships crew members enjoy 
when compared to the us troops who have taken up positions in the 
saudi desert 
i really feel sympathy for those guys out there in the sand 
at least we can duck inside cool off and have a good meal he 
said 
like other us warships the taylor now has a small contingent 
of us coast guardsmen veterans of the us governments 
caribbean drug interdiction program to assist in enforcing the 
unsanctioned iraqi blockade 
each boarding party includes eight or more members both sailors 
and coast guardsmen

the talk from the 
exhausted group huddled under the f15 turned quickly from the 
intricacies of jet engines to worries about financial support for 
their wives and children back home 
the us government may cut the supplemental income soldiers 
received back home for living offbase because they now get their 
food and supplies free in saudi arabia 
i just had a kid four weeks ago and that money is figured into 
my finances chris jessen tells a visitor to an f15 maintenance 
hanger on wednesday where the airmen work 12hour shifts in 
sweltering heat 
if they take it away then in essence the government is 
saying sergeant youre going to pay us this money so that you can 
go to saudi arabia and support the mission he said 
jessens buddies huddled under the f15 nod their heads in 
agreement all but one of the five is married the four that are 
all have children one found out the other day his wife is pregnant 
with their fourth child 
as far as morale thats the biggest problem kevin wilde 
of sioux city iowa said of the possible loss of the pay known as 
bas basic allowance for subsistence for these men it amounts to 
an extra 180 a month about 20 percent of their total pay 
their commanding officer interjects saying that for now the air 
forces tactical air command has kept up the payments but that 
congress will have to act to keep the money flowing if the the bas 
payments are to continue throughout the us deployment 
the airmen complain a bit about the heat and the long hours 
spent hunched under the seemingly endless line of f15s needing 
maintenance 
airman adam bayes describes the days this way you go to work 
for 12 hours go home get clean go to bed wake up get clean 
whatever do your laundry if you can do that come to work work 
go home sleep its getting to be a routine 
so much so that wilde spent his day off this week sitting around 
watching his buddies work 
i didnt know what else to do he said 
during a visit to the troops last week georgia sen sam nunn 
was pulled aside by col john mcbroom commander of the first 
tactical fighter wing mcbrooms message do something to keep the 
extra money flowing to the families back home 
there are some indications congress might heed the advice of 
mcbroom and other commanders in the saudi desert 
at a white house meeting wednesday sen john glenn dohio 
suggested that congress and the administration agree on a pay and 
income tax incentive package for the troops deployed in saudi 
arabia to forestall a morale problem 
the airmen interviewed wednesday predict just such problems if 
the money is cut off as the law stands now servicemen lose the 
extra payments when they get free meals 
every serviceman here that has heard about it is in an 
uproar said jessen 
theyre telling us that for the opportunity to go and sweat 
over in saudi arabia you may pay me uncle sam 180 a month 
jessen said weve got family at home depending on that money and 
we cant afford to lose it

the screening committee reviewing 
applications to the 20000 international violin competition had 
doubts about a brazilian candidate but her audition tape was so 
dazzling they invited her to play 
but when blumita singer did she was so bad that some in the 
audience giggled and others walked out 
the panel of judges then reviewed the audition tape and soon 
concluded it hadnt been singers artistry but that of yehudi 
menuhin or fritz kreisler two of this centurys greatest 
violinists 
the judges disqualified singer from the competition the richest 
in the world 
it took just five notes for those 10 people to say whos 
this playing it must be menuhin or kreisler thomas j 
beckiewicz executive director of the annual contest said 
wednesday when you have 10 of the most expert violinists in the 
world you cannot fake anything 
singer 26 was sent home to sao paolo brazil on tuesday she 
had performed in sundays preliminary competition 
she was the first person accused of fraud in the contests 
eightyear history 
besides the 20000 cash prize the competition offers concert 
opportunities and recording contracts for the gold silver and 
bronze medalists the gold medalist also debuts at carnegie hall 
the screening committee reviewed more than 200 candidates 
singer was among 53 who made the cut 
singer said on her application she received professional 
training at the manhattan school of music in 198384 and at 
juilliard in 1982 and that she was taught by the late violinist 
henryk szeryng from 1984 to 1987 she also listed several 
competitions and awards including first prizes in the 1983 fritz 
kreisler talent award and 1975 national young soloists competition 
it was not immediately known whether she had falsified any of 
those credentials 
the screening committee looked at this portfolio with special 
care because there were doubts in their minds from the beginning 
beckiewicz said 
he said the committee had doubts about documents accompanying 
the application including recommendation letters copies of 
certificates of musical education and programs and reviews of 
concerts she supposedly had given 
when she was confronted with the fraud allegation she offered 
no admission no regrets no penitence beckiewicz said she 
showed no indignation but some stress that she was unmasked 
no further action will be taken against singer contest 
officials said 
she did not return a message left on the answering machine at 
her home wednesday 
singer was accepted as part of a very honest effort to search 
out those who are less known beczkiewicz said i dont want to 
discourage the screening committee from taking a few risks 
however he said that to prevent cheating future applicants may 
be required to submit a statement documenting the authenticity of 
their tapes

beginning friday 16 semifinalists will perform full recitals over 
four days six finalists then will be selected and each will

bush administration officials say they fear an 
oil shortage from the embargo against iraq and kuwait may develop 
just at the time americans turn up their furnaces for winter 
if so private analysts said it could cause a repeat of the 
heating oil crisis last winter when the coldest december in 60 
years sent prices of the fuel up by an average 45 cents a gallon on 
the east coast and related propane prices up by more than a dollar 
despite commitments by other producers to make up much of the 
iraqikuwaiti output and record high inventories both government 
and private analysts said they expect a world shortage to develop 
by the end of november 
the last half of the fourth quarter gives us concern 
assistant energy secretary john j easton jr told the house 
government operations committee on wednesday we see the 
potential for greater uncertainty as winter develops 
the 21nation international energy agency foresees a shortage of 
500000 barrels a day developing over the next three months 
because the winter seasonal demand for oil is expected to increase 
by several million barrels a day private analysts said the 
shortage could be much larger particularly if it is unusually cold 
edward n krapels president of energy security analysis inc of 
washington said the shortfall could easily reach 2 million 
barrels a day possibly sending oil prices above 40 a barrel 
we are convinced that useable commercial crude oil stocks will 
be depleted by the end of october he said anticipation of the 
shortage will result in a runup of crude oil prices that will be 
translated into higher heating oil prices as the winter develops 
krapels whose firm closely monitors world oil supplies said 
the government could preempt a spiraling of home heating oil 
prices by immediately drafting a contingency plan to begin drawing 
down the nations 590millionbarrel strategic petroleum reserve in 
november 
a reasonable organized modest drawdown will send a signal 
not only to the oil industry and to consumers but also to the 
financial markets that the winter will be a difficult one but not 
an economybreaking one he said 
the administration has said it will dip into the reserve only 
when a real shortage occurs and not as a price mechanism 
compounding the threat of heating oil shortages is the worldwide 
lack of refining capacity now boycotted refineries in kuwait and 
iraq accounted for about 12 percent of worlds gasoline jet and 
diesel fuel and heating oil production 
meanwhile the us petroleum industry in the face of high 
operating costs and environmental opposition has shut down more 
than 100 refineries without building a single one in the past 
decade 
calvin kent director of the governments energy information 
administration said refineries already were operating at more than 
90 percent capacity an alltime high to meet the summer demand 
for gasoline and to build heating oil stockpiles when iraq invaded 
kuwait last month 
the cold snap last winter and related fires and explosions from 
trying to continue production during it forced some refineries to 
close and others to cut their output an event that officials fear 
could happen again 
theres no question that an accident would cause a severe 
impact on supply and prices kent said

the democratic congressman from connecticut 
told secretary of state james a baker iii that everyone was 
thrilled with the administrations handling of the persian gulf 
crisis youve done a terrific job said rep sam gejdenson 
the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said 
america was solidly behind president bushs policies not since the 
cuban missile crisis said sen claiborne pell dri had he seen 
as much pulling together as there is now 
superb said the senator from new york you have made an 
impression on the world and that doesnt happen to many people 
many times democrat daniel patrick moynihan told baker 
bakers testimony tuesday and wednesday marked the first 
administration appearance before congressional committees since 
bush committed us force in response to after iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 
but with all the praise there was an undertone of misgiving 
lawmakers wanted to know where the exit was they wanted to know 
what the united states would do about saddam hussein and his 
countrys nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities even if he 
withdraws kuwait 
the questions betraying uneasiness were sandwiched between the 
barrages of praise for the way bush and baker had won worldwide 
cooperation and support 
a brilliant job so far said sen joseph biden ddel but 
i need more explanations of where its going to go from here 
what your plans are 
bakers replies were often vague he spoke of a regional 
security arrangement some sort of mideast nato to check saddam 
he spoke of a longterm american sea or land presence and he 
called for american patience 
that is what we ask most of the american people he said 
stand firm be patient and remain united so that together we can 
show that aggression does not pay 
sen paul sarbanes dmd said that even if bushs goals are 
met we are left with an iraq to deal with afterwards 
sen richard lugar rind wanted to know if baker could not 
provide some sort of international united way campaign donor 
chart listing which countries were providing troops which were 
sending money and how much 
biden wanted to know why bush insists on returning the kuwaiti 
emir to power rather than taking the opportunity to encourage the 
democratic selection of the countrys leaders 
rep james leach riowa making the same point said an emirate 
is a little bit difficult from a historical american perspective 
to be too thrilled about protecting 
rep peter kostmayer dpa said he hated to be the skunk at 
the garden party but had to wonder if deep down this wasnt a 
fight for cheap oil 
i dont think that young men and young women of this country 
are prepared to spill their blood in the sands of saudi arabia to 
keep the price of gasoline cheap kostmayer said 
baker said protecting the worlds oil supplies was an objective 
but not the overriding reason why america is there 
sen john kerry dmass just back from a visit with the troops 
in saudi arabia said saudi forces and us marines were in 
position to shed the first blood in a war but i didnt notice 
any of our other allies 
baker said 26 nations have sent military assets of one form or 
another and he was hopeful others would he offered to list other 
commitments but only in closed session 
the extrication question was raised by kostmayer at the house 
foreign affairs committee hearing what if saddam hussein simply 
stays where he is could this go on for months or years where 
does this end 
we have not put a time frame on it baker replied because 
im not sure we can put a time frame on it now it is 
important yes that we succeed but also that we build a regional 
security structure that is able to contain the aggressive 
tendencies of a leader like this 
kostmayer persisted could it be years 
baker said he would not want to speculate because some 
continuing us presence on land or sea would be called for in 
the new regional security structure he foresaw 
these are questions that are going to have to be addressed 
down the line he said and theyre questions that are going to 
have to be studied considerably

the united states is deploying 
missile batteries multiple rocket launchers and mines in saudi 
arabias northern desert to blunt any possible iraqi thrust 
military officials say 
in the last two days patriot missile batteries designed to 
shoot down incoming missiles and multiple rocket launchers used to 
smash troop buildups have been brought in to reinforce us 
positions closest to the kuwaiti border 
the weapons have been transported north over the past week in 
huge convoys that also carried hundreds of troops to forward camps 
us marines at a base camp close to the kuwaiti border said 
they were preparing to mine strategic northsouth roads but were 
taking special precautions to protect refugees fleeing kuwait 
mines will be placed along a side road running south from 
kuwait with warnings posted for refugees said the marines who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the main highway from kuwait to dhahran in saudi arabias 
oilrich eastern province is to be be drilled and wired so mines 
can be placed at short notice to hinder any iraqi advance 
a marine gunnery sergeant taking part in the mining operation 
pointed out a small bridge connecting a highway that runs through 
rough terrain 
if the united states gets wind of a possible iraqi attack 
thatll be gone he said 
the deployments will help the united states improve its 
groundbased fighting capabilities after relying on air power for 
defense in the weeks following the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait 
commanders say that in about a month the buildup will offer 
enough firepower to make them comfortable about offensive 
operations if they are ordered to attack 
at the marines forward base camp the commanding officer lt 
col jim mattis said his troops were in a defensive posture 
we didnt come here to fight mattis said in an interview at 
the base command post my concern is to defend the area to which 
ive been assigned if someone wants to fight well finish them 
off 
mattis said his troops can rely on air cover from marine and 
royal saudi air force attack helicopters and fighter jets 
including f18s and vertical takeoff harriers 
on the ground the marines have tanks and other armored vehicles 
the forwardmost us forces are taking up positions in the 
desert behind saudi and arab troops manning the frontline just 
south of kuwait 
scout patrols from the forward marines the 7th marine 
expeditionary brigade is within 40 miles of kuwait have advanced 
beyond those forces on reconnaissance missions said sources who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
theyre just getting the lay of the land its nothing 
devious one source said 
the american forces appear to be growing more confident every 
day as slowmoving ships carrying heavy ground force armor arrive 
in the region 
a cluster of ships carrying marine amphibious forces are now a 
few days from the persian gulf 
the convoys moving north include doubledecker buses carrying 
hundreds of soldiers and dozens of transport trucks carrying tanks 
artillery and other heavy equipment there also are scores of 
refueling and other support vehicles for the tanks and infantry 
carriers 
an army official said troop and equipment movements were being 
made at night not to hide them but because of the cooler 
temperatures and to avoid raising fears among saudis 
driving through towns in the middle of the day with a 
halfmilelong row of tanks and rockets isnt a particularly good 
idea he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
most of the gear transported north in the past few days belongs 
to the 24th mechanized infantry division a georgiabased unit 
armed with fastmoving m1 tanks and bradley armored fighting 
vehicles or afvs 
still being unloaded at a saudi port is similar heavy equipment 
for the 197th infantry which will join the 24th in the forwardmost 
us positions in saudi arabia 
the air force brought f111 bombers into the region earlier this 
week and is adding to its fighter arsenal many of the new 
squadrons are being based in other persian gulf nations

the navy has lifted its ban on firing the 
battleship wisconsins 16inch guns but an investigation continues 
into the explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors aboard its 
sister ship the iowa 
the wisconsin is in the persian gulf and is the only battleship 
deployed in the conflict there 
should us forces take action the ships huge guns could blast 
shore points to protect a possible marine land assault the massive 
weapons can heave 2700pound shells more than 20 miles 
a navy statement issued wednesday at the pentagon said the 
battleship has been granted authority to begin live firing 
training and operations 
navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii made the decision after 
consulting the services top admiral adm frank kelso 
the decision came after extensive testing of the gunpowder 
bags used in the guns said navy spokesman cmdr jim mitchell 
the navy unit in charge of testing the naval sea systems 
command has now determined that the guns may safely fire certain 
lots of propellant a navy statement said 
mitchell said the navys investigation into the april 19 1989 
explosion aboard the iowa is expected to be concluded later this 
year 
mitchell said investigators have found that there was a greater 
chance for an explosion in a gunpowder bag if a limited number of 
propellant grains were in the top layer known as the tare layer 
of the bag 
the gunpowder bags are filled with several layers of pellets or 
gun powder grains 
mitchell said investigators concluded during the past four 
months of new tests that 20 or more grains of powder in the tare 
layer provides a substantial safety margin even if a bag of powder 
should be compressed by a highspeed overram during the loading of 
a 16inch gun 
he said the navy had removed from service all powder bags 
containing less than 20 grains of powder in that layer still he 
said this does not imply that these powder bags were unsafe 
last year the navy said the iowa explosion most probably 
was an intentional act by gunners mate 2nd class clayton hartwig 
of cleveland 
the service accused hartwig of placing some type of detonation 
device between the gunpowder bags while loading the 16inch guns 
during gunnery practice on board the iowa however the navy 
admitted it only had circumstantial evidence 
the navy reopened its investigation of the explosion in may 
after an unexplained ignition of some gunpowder bags occurred 
during additional testing ordered by congress 
some members of congress during their own investigation into 
the iowa explosion suggested that ramming the gunpowder bags too 
vigorously or instability in the gunpowder bags could have 
caused the iowa explosion 
the suspension of firing the huge guns aboard the battleships 
was ordered by garrett on may 24 
the navy said the battleship missouri will be authorized to 
conduct live firing upon completion of a series of certifications 
and inspections 
the other two battleships the iowa and the new jersey are in 
port and are scheduled to be decommissioned in 1991 because of 
budget constraints

three radical leftists have agreed to plead 
guilty to a 1983 bombing at the us capitol and to setting off 
bombs at seven other sites in new york and washington 
as part of their deal with prosecutors charges against three 
codefendants are to be dropped 
laura j whitehorn linda s evans and marilyn j buck are 
scheduled to appear in us district court on friday to plead 
guilty to participating in a twoyear campaign of armed 
propaganda to set off bombs at government buildings and private 
offices according to court documents 
the bombs caused property damage but did not injure any people 
the nov 7 1983 blast at the capitol blew a hole in a wall 
outside the us senate chamber damaged five paintings and knocked 
the door to democratic leader robert byrds office off its hinges 
bombing charges against three other members of the group which 
called itself the armed resistance unit the revolutionary fighting 
group or the red guerrilla resistance would be dropped as part of 
the deal 
law enforcement officials have linked the group of radicals to 
series of crimes dating back to the 16 million armed holdup of a 
brinks armored car near nyack ny in 1981 buck is serving a 
50year sentence for participating in a string of armed robberies 
including the brinks holdup in which two policemen and a guard were 
killed 
the plea agreement was revealed in court papers filed last week 
in federal court in washington the filing by us attorney jay 
stephens gave no reason for the governments decision to settle the 
case saying only it was in the interest of justice 
attorneys familiar with the case said a supreme court ruling 
about double jeopardy in may influenced the governments decision 
to drop charges gainst susan l rosenberg timothy a blunk and 
alan berkman 
both rosenberg and blunk are serving 58year sentences for 
possession of an arsenal of explosives they were arrested in 1984 
while loading more than 600 pounds of explosive material into a 
rented storage bin in cherry hill nj 
berkman a physician who is serving a 10year sentence for 
possession of explosives firearms and fake identity cards suffers 
from hodgkins disease 
a seventh defendant in the case elizabeth duke is a fugitive 
rosenberg blunk and berkman won dismissal of the charges 
against them in 1989 when us district judge harold h greene held 
that evidence used to convict them of the earlier charges was the 
basis for the bombing indictment 
but the charges were reinstated last fall when the us circuit 
court of appeals here found that the doublejeopardy rule did not 
apply to their case 
the defense renewed its double jeopardy claim in june after the 
high court ruled in a new york case that evidence used to convict a 
person of one crime could not be submitted to charge the same 
defendant with a different offense 
greene has not ruled on that motion 
according to the deal outlined in court papers whitehorn 45 
buck 43 and evans 43 agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy and 
malicious damage to the us capitol the offenses carry a maximum 
15year prison term 
whitehorn also agreed to plead guilty to a fraud charge in 
connection with the possession of false documents found in the 
baltimore apartment she shared with buck and evans the charge 
carries a maximum fiveyear sentence 
in addition to the explosion at the capitol bombs were 
detonated outside the national war college at fort mcnair here 
april 26 1983 the washington navy yard computer center on aug 
18 1983 and the washington navy yard officers club on april 20 
1984 
bombs were also placed at the fbis office on staten island 
ny on jan 28 1983 the israeli aircraft industries building in 
new york on april 5 1984 the south african consulate in new york 
on sept 26 1984 and the new york patrolmens benevolent 
association on feb 23 1985

its only rock n roll but she plays it on a 
harp 
i hate to play classical says amy lee who entertains lunch 
crowds at the art institute of chicago with hits by the likes of 
pink floyd led zeppelin and the rolling stones but when people 
request it i get out my bag of bach and my music stand and sit 
there pluck pluck plucking 
lee 34 got tired of blacktie formals bach and loungelizard 
pop tunes like feelings when she got hooked on rock as a 
teenager 
she has worked as a disc jockey and symphony musician but her 
solo career took off after she performed rock n roll during a 
1981 jazz festival in chicago she was dubbed the angel of rock 
i remember i got a standing ovation for playing stairway to 
heaven she said 
lee looks the part of a rock angel decked out in bright colors 
a short skirt bold earrings and dark sunglasses she taps her feet 
and sways as her fingers speed across the 6foot 47string antique 
harp her father gave her when she was 7 
the kind of music she makes should be paid attention to 
said alek jakich an inspector for the city of chicago and a 
regular at the art institutes outdoor restaurant where lee has 
worked the last eight summers 
when was the last time your heard pink floyd on the harp 
jakich asked and its great 
playing rock is a switch from when lee performed with the 
northwest indiana symphony and the twin city symphony of st 
joseph mich being alone on stage is also a switch 
im usually background music the 5foot5 blonde said at a 
performance tuesday so i decided why not play something i 
like 
that day her songs by the eurythmics the kinks and the police 
got her a complimentary glass of wine from two women having lunch 
praise from a mother visiting the gallery with her toddler and 
applause after nearly every song 
waiters came up to whisper several requests during her 
performance in the outdoor atrium scattered with white tables and 
matching parasols 
once they hear the rock songs then they want to request 
them said lee who also performs in lounges and has her own jazz 
group ive gotten requests for tom petty and the grateful dead 
but i also get requests for lady of spain

increased taxes are inevitable in improving 
americas schools state and local educators say as a national poll 
suggests americans may be willing to pay 
kentucky education secretary jack foster california state 
superintendent bill honig and pat tornillo jr of the united 
teachers of dade miami fla said wednesday that tax increases are 
essential to finance the numerous education reform proposals by 
local state and federal officials but they stressed that 
property taxes should not be the only funding source 
the taxpayer issue is bugging everyone interested in school 
reform said foster 
their comments during an allday education conference hosted by 
cbs news at georgetown university underscored the results of a cbs 
news poll that showed americans would support a tax hike if the 
money went to their own neighborhood schools 
according to the poll 71 percent of the 1107 adults

federal health officials today unveiled goals 
for improving americans health over the next decade to be 
achieved by encouraging healthy living and preventing disease 
we can no longer afford not to invest in prevention dr 
james mason assistant secretary for health in the department of 
health and human services said in a 671page report 
from the perspective of avoiding human suffering as well as 
saving wasteful costs for treating diseases and injuries that could 
have been prevented the 1990s should be the decade of prevention 
in the united states he said 
the report identifies 298 specific health objectives covering a 
range of areas including fitness nutrition tobacco alcohol 
drugs family planning mental health occupational and 
environmental health food safety cancer heart disease aids 
infant health and sexually transmitted diseases 
the key to good health hhs secretary louis sullivan said in his 
foreword to the report is personal responsibility which is to 
say responsible and enlightened behavior by each and every 
individual 
among the objectives to be obtained by the year 2000 were 
increasing 30 percent the proportion of people who engage in 
regular moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day 
in 1985 an estimated 22 percent of people were doing this 
reduce the prevalence of overweight adults to no more than 20 
percent down from the current 26 percent 
cut to 15 percent the proportion of adults who smoke in 1987 
an estimated 29 percent of the population smoked 
reduce pregnancies to 50 per 1000 girls under 18 in this age 
group 71 per 1000 girls became pregnant in 1985 
increase use of automobile safety restraints to 85 percent of 
occupants up from the current 42 percent who report using them 
eliminate elevated blood lead levels in children under 5 
currently 10 percent of these children have levels above 25 
micrograms per deciliter 
reduce infant mortality to 7 deaths per 1000 births 
provisional data for 1989 shows a rate of 97 per 1000 
cut coronary heart disease deaths to 100 per 100000 in 1987 
135 per 100000 died from this disease 
reverse the rise in cancer deaths from 133 per 100000 in 1987 
down to at least the 1970 rate of 130 per 100000 by the turn of 
the century 
limit annual incidence of diagnosed aids cases to 98000 an 
estimated 4400050000 cases were diagnosed in 1989 
the objectives in healthy people 2000 were developed in a 
threeyear effort led by the public health service and involved 
more than 300 voluntary and professional organizations and state 
health departments 
they build on a similar effort begun in 1979 in which national 
goals were set for 1990 data for the previous 10 years has not 
been compiled yet and an assessment of the first set of goals was 
not expected until next year 
a midcourse review in 1986 found that about half the 226 
objectives had been achieved or likely would be by the end of the 
decade these included reductions in high blood pressure smoking 
and motor vehicle accidents and increases in immunizations 
but about a quarter of the objectives were not likely to be met 
and a similar proportion could not be measured targets of concern 
included infant mortality among minority and lowincome women drug 
abuse and the proportion of americans who are overweight

presidential chief of staff john sununu back 
from a managerial mission to moscow says the soviet union is going 
through a debate similar to what the united states faced in framing 
its own constitution two centuries ago 
sununu and a team of top white house aides spent five days last 
week in moscow and leningrad it was a return visit with soviet 
efficiency experts who toured the white house and several cabinet 
departments in june looking for tips on how to run the soviet 
unions rapidly changing government 
sununu said the americans gave the soviets plenty of 
nutsandbolts advice then this time he said the soviets were 
more interested in discussing broader issues of government 
including how to balance the role of the central government in 
moscow with demands for independence from the 15 soviet republics 
in an interview with news agency reporters wednesday sununu 
said the soviets are experiencing something like what our country 
went through about 210 years ago as we worked from the articles of 
confederation to our own constitution 
the framers of the us constitution had to go back then and 
convince the states that they ought to give up all the powers 
they had to the new central government he said 
in the soviet union on the other hand theyre trying to 
convince the federal government to give back all the powers to the 
republics sununu said but the same issues are being debated 
the issue of currency the issue of the banks the issue of who 
owns the resources within the lands 
sununu said he is convinced that there is no turning back from 
the soviet unions march away from communism and towards a market 
economy 
not once in any of our discussions did the word communism 
come up not once he said we didnt find anybody who wanted 
to turn back from economic reforms 
there was an undertone to all the discussions that a lot of 
the pulling and tugging of breaking it up is so that they can come 
back and renegotiate putting it back together again said sununu 
nobody seemed to be doing it just for the sake of stirring the 
pot they all seemed to be very sincere in trying to work this 
thing out 
among other things sununu said he was asked what special 
perquisites went with working for the us government 
it was a big surprise for them to hear that top federal 
officials made less working for the government than they could 
command in business he said 
sununu and his group met with boris yeltsin the excommunist 
party maverick and president of the russian republic as well as 
defense minister dmitri t yazov foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and other top soviet officials 
a meeting with president mikhail s gorbachev was on the 
schedule but it was scrapped when gorbachev wound up in a marathon 
meeting instead with yeltsin that produced an agreement for radical 
economic reforms 
sununu praised the kremlins computerized personnel system 
which he said tracks both job openings and top candidates 
in some sense we wish we kind of had one as detailed and as 
efficient as that he said 
the soviets select people from a more narrow group and have 
almost everybodys background and capacity available at their 
fingertips he said

books written to not offend adults teachers 
who are poorly trained and a curriculum that seems designed to 
snuff out interest are all crippling biology education in 
america a national academy of sciences panel said in a study 
released today 
the study said correcting the flaws in the way american school 
children are taught biology will require changes on virtually every 
level of education from the preparing of teachers to the 
attitudes of parents school boards and local governments 
among the points made 
biology teaching starts too late in school and is generally 
of such poor quality that students learn to dislike science 
textbooks are often too long abysmally crafted and written 
with the implicit aim of avoiding offense to a scientifically 
illiterate segment of the adult population 
schools of education where teachers are taught to teach 
present pedagogical information so unrelated to the specifics of 
teaching science as to be of little or no help 
middle and high school students are taught science as courses 
in memorizing terms which they soon forget most students leave 
the experience with the conviction that further exposure to science 
is something to be avoided if at all possible the report said 
it noted that a test given 12000 american high school 
students showed that half who had not taken biology did as well or 
better than 40 percent of those who had taken such courses 
clearly the report said a great many children are 
learning almost nothing in their biology courses 
too many of our teachers the report said are recruited 
from the lowest academic quartile of the college population 
further teachers are given little opportunity update their 
scientific knowledge or to interact with research scientists in 
industry or academia 
the preparation of teachers needs drastic reform the report 
said 
to improve the system the national academy of sciences panel 
these and other changes need to be made 
start teaching courses in science during the elementary school 
years and devote more class time to the subject orient 
middleschool courses toward human biology to help overcome 
misinformation about health hygiene and disease and in high 
school teach central concepts in an easy language instead of 
involving detailed complex terms that must be memorized the 
courses should laboratory work 
textbooks should be reviewed by the scientific community to 
assure accuracy and currency and working scientists should assist 
school boards and teachers in evaluating proposed texts 
testing should be revised so that it does not drive the 
curriculum the nation the report said should be more interested 
in teaching and materials than in ranking student performance 
research is need on what makes education programs for 
teachers effective the study said it recommended that science 
teachers should be given opportunities to train in actual 
laboratories of research scientists colleges should develop 
undergraduate training for teachers that includes advice from 
scientists on how best to teach science 
universities should offer summertime training programs for 
elementary middle and high school science teachers continuing 
education of teachers should include not just what to teach but 
how to teach 
though the panel declined to make a cost estimate the report 
said that a major commitment of funds will be needed to 
accomplish the goals of improving biology education 
the report was prepared by three committees that included more 
than 50 educators and scientists from many parts of the country and 
selected by the national research council the council is an 
affiliate of the national academy of sciences

state workers who engage in sex outside of 
marriage should not be allowed to keep their jobs republican 
gubernatorial hopeful evan mecham says 
from my viewpoint they shouldnt be in government service 
because theyre lawbreakers mecham said in a campaign appearance 
arizona has laws against a variety of sexual acts as well as 
against open and notorious cohabitation but the laws are 
seldom enforced 
mecham was elected governor in 1986 he offended homosexuals 
women blacks hispanics jews and orientals with a series of 
remarks and was impeached and ousted on unrelated charges in 1988 
i never went out looking or declaring war on homosexuals

he said there are other lawbreakers too that shouldnt be 
allowed there im not just picking homosexuals out 
i dont know that we will ever launch a program to try to get 
everybody whos living a lifestyle that isnt totally within the 
cover of the law out because there are a lot of those people

savings and loan crisis is agreeing to give notice of any large 
transactions and not to transfer assets out of the country 
under an agreement announced wednesday by the justice 
department keating must file financial statements with the office 
of thrift supervision and must tell that agency 48 hours in advance 
of any transactions exceeding 5000 
those terms had previously been imposed on keating by a 
preliminary injunction issued by the us district court in los 
angeles wednesdays announcement indicated he had agreed to them 
keating already has provided financial statements which have 
not been disclosed 
regulators wanted to determine if keating transferred money out

extensively in switzerland and the bahamas in the last few years 
keating has denied transferring any funds overseas 
the justice department reached the agreement which was filed in 
the los angeles court on behalf of the office of thrift 
supervision an agency of the treasury department 
the ots had previously ordered keating to prove his assertion 
that he is broke the agency partially froze his assets in 
connection with its efforts to recover 41 million from keating and 
five associates 
the governments enforcement efforts stem from the collapse of 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif which 
keating controlled and has been accused of looting regulators 
estimate the failure may cost taxpayers 2 billion ranking with 
miamis centrust bank as the costliest sampl failures 
keating earned huge salaries lived lavishly and contributed 
heavily to politicians while he headed american continental corp 
a development company based in phoenix that owned lincoln 
his case has attracted particular attention because of his 13 
million in contributions to the campaigns of five senators 
republican john mccain of arizona and democrats alan cranston of 
california donald w riegle jr of michigan dennis deconcini of 
arizona and john glenn of ohio 
keating has contended he never broke any laws and that 
government officials are making him a scapegoat to conceal their 
own inability to prevent the sampl disaster 
us district judge stanley sporkin in washington recently 
dismissed keatings lawsuit to recover control of lincoln saying 
actions by keating and his cohorts amounted to a looting of 
lincoln 
after the ruling keating resigned as chairman and chief 
executive of american continental which is in bankruptcy

rep lamar smith rtexas says he has a plan 
to reduce the federal deficit by cutting 27 billion from the 
governments administrative expenses 
smith wrote congressional colleagues wednesday proposing to trim 
10 percent of 270 billion spent on travel phone calls printing 
lights and other costs 
he said the idea is better than having acrosstheboard cuts 
due to take effect automatically under the grammrudman 
budgetbalancing law unless targets are met for reducing the 
deficit 
what this says to federal office managers is you need to 
determine within your office how to cut indirect costs 10 percent 
you can do it by having one fewer training sessions you can do it 
by taking less travel you can do it by having fewer supplies 
smith said 
budget negotiators are scheduled to resume meeting this weekend 
seeking ways to reduce the deficit by 50 billion 
using data from the office of management and budget smith said 
his staff determined the government will spend about 340 billion 
in overhead or indirect costs next year smith exempted about 70 
billion in research and development appropriations to get the 270 
billion figure he said it does not include salaries

the food and drug administration is rethinking 
whether to regulate dietary supplements such as ltryptophan which 
has been linked to the deaths of 27 americans 
although the agency started requiring a federal safety review 
before a nutritional supplement could be marketed in 1973 the fda 
stopped trying to enforce its rule after two unsuccessful court 
cases 
since the mid1970s the fda has largely maintained a 
handsoff posture towards dietary supplements in general 
spokesman jeff nesbit said wednesday 
since the health threat that resulted in all ltryptophanbased 
products being taken off the market in march however the fda has 
begun to review that policy acting fda commissioner james benson 
recently asked agency officials to examine our regulation of this 
whole area nesbit said 
ltryptophan an amino acid used to treat insomnia depression 
and obesity was ordered off the market after it was linked to an 
outbreak of a rare blood disorder called eosinophiliamyalgia 
syndrome the syndrome has struck 1500 people and killed 27 
according to the federal centers for disease control 
the outbreak has been traced to one japanese manufacturer of 
ltryptophan a study by minnesota scientists linked the deaths to 
a change in the how the supplement was made 
the main regulatory obstacle in the fdas mind is a 1976 law 
sponsored by thensen william proxmire dwis prohibiting the 
fda from acting against makers of vitamins and minerals unless 
there is a clear public health risk 
the proxmire amendment does not address dietary supplements 
specifically but fda officials believe the law and the two court 
cases leave the agency with little power to act 
other dietary supplement makers say the fda has the authority it 
needs

in a major turnaround in colombias 
antidrug strategy president cesar gaviria has announced that 
cocaine traffickers who surrender will not be extradited to the 
united states 
the new president said his decree wednesday is part of a plan to 
end drugrelated terrorism a yearold war between the government 
and traffickers fighting extradition has left hundreds of people 
dead 
those who have been in crime and who have repented and who 
voluntarily turn themselves in to judges in order to freely confess 
their crimes may be tried by our judges based on our judicial 
order gaviria said in a nationally televised speech wednesday 
night 
in july the medellin cocaine cartel declared a unilateral 
ceasefire in its terrorist attacks apparently hoping that the new 
administration would end extraditions 
gaviria who was inaugurated aug 7 said in his speech that 
criminals who turn themselves in will also face lighter sentences 
judges will be given the capacity to reduce sentences of 
those who turn themselves in confess their crimes lay down 
weapons and other goods linked to their crimes and cooperate with 
investigations 
in repeated communiques drug traffickers using the pseudonym 
the extraditables have offered to turn themselves in to 
colombian judges if the government promises to end extraditions 
their communiques bore the letterhead we prefer a tomb in 
colombia to a jail cell in the united states 
extradition is a sensitive issue in colombia because many people 
believe sending people to be tried in a foreign country is an 
insult to national pride still colombias justice system has so 
far failed to keep any major drug trafficker in jail traffickers 
often bribe or threaten officials into letting them go free many 
judges who refused to be intimidated have been murdered 
gaviria has said fortifying the judicial system is a major 
priority in his administration the government plans to build 
special fortress cities where judges and their families can 
live and work free of intimidation 
gavirias predecessor virgilio barco resumed extradited 
accused drug traffickers to the united states a year ago after drug 
bosses declared total war on the state 
in his speech wednesday gaviria said three colombians currently 
awaiting extradition would be sent to the united states but he 
said three other extradition requests by the united states have 
been rejected 
currently 14 people are in colombian jails awaiting 
extradition the barco administration extradited 22 colombians 
the government blames the medellin cartel for killing more than 
500 people including at least two presidential candidates in a 
long series of bombings and assassinations 
the war began in august 1989 with the assassination of sen luis 
carlos galan a presidential hopeful of the governing liberal party 
who took a tough stand against the drug lords 
gaviria galans campaign manager became the partys winning 
candidate 
in addition to the victims of the drug war with the government 
thousands of people have died in fighting between rival drug gangs 
and violence blamed on right wing death squads financed by cocaine 
smugglers 
gaviria said the new judicial measures apply to members of 
paramilitary groups as well as drug traffickers 
members of paramilitary groups say they are merely farmers and 
ranchers seeking to defend themselves from leftist guerrillas but 
human rights activists say the groups are drugfinanced death 
squads that kill peasants suspected of sympathizing with guerrillas 
in his speech gaviria reiterated his call for international 
cooperation in fighting drugs he said colombia has been successful 
in reducing cocaine supplies on us streets 
once again we ask of the international community an effective 
solidarity which transends the realm of words and pep talks the 
president said 
he asked developed countries to limit drug consumption money 
laundering arms trafficking and the sale of chemicals used to 
process cocaine 
colombias medellin and cali cartels supply most of the cocaine 
consumed in the united states and europe

navy doctors were not responsible for the 
suicide of sen john east a federal judge ruled in rejecting his 
widows 35 million wrongfuldeath claim 
priscilla east had contended that government doctors who provide 
care for members of congress did not promptly diagnose a thyroid 
disorder and that the delay led to her husbands suicide in 1986 
us district judge walter black on wednesday ruled the care the 
north carolina republican received at bethesda naval medical center 
was not perfect but did not constitute negligence 
terri steinhaus one of mrs easts lawyers called the ruling 
unfortunate but said no decision had been made on whether to 
appeal the lawyer said mrs east had no comment 
a government lawyer said the decision vindicates the doctors 
the physicians have had to live with a cloud over their careers 
for some period of time said assistant us attorney ira oring 
blacks ruling came four months after an eightweek trial he 
presided over without a jury 
east 55 a firstterm senator killed himself by running his

a study published today says parents who smoke may 
raise the risk their children will get lung cancer when they grow 
up 
the study in the new england journal of medicine is the first to 
suggest that passive smoking is especially hazardous for youngsters 
it found that nonsmoking adults who lived at least 13 years 
with two cigarette smokers during their childhood and adolescence 
face double the usual risk of getting lung cancer 
the findings from this and other studies have made me feel it 
is a very prudent thing to discourage people from smoking in your 
house said dr dwight t janerich who directed the study 
his research conducted at yale medical school suggests that 
exposure to smoke in the home early in life is to blame for 17 
percent of all lung cancer among people who never smoked 
the environmental protection agency estimates that about 25000 
of the more than 150000 new cases of lung cancer annually occur 
among nonsmokers and 40 percent of them or 10000 people never 
smoked if the latest estimate is correct this means that about 
1700 cases each year are caused by childhood exposure to other 
peoples cigarette smoke 
children are really a captive audience said dr alfred 
munzer a spokesman for the american lung association and a 
pulmonary specialist at washington adventist hospital in takoma 
park md theyre the ideal guinea pig because they have no way 
of escaping their parents smoke its not surprising that they 
should show the effects of passive smoking 
lung cancer may occur long after people stop smoking janerich 
said secondhand smoke may be especially hazardous to children 
because they have so many years ahead of them in which to develop 
lung cancer 
it makes a strong case that exposure to secondhand smoke as a 
child increases your risk as an adult this is quite convincing 
commented dr stanton glantz of the university of california at san 
francisco 
the study turned up no evidence that smoking by spouses or 
coworkers causes cancer although the researchers cautioned that 
their work could not rule out this possibility 
the study was based on a survey of 191 nonsmokers in new york 
state who were diagnosed with lung cancer in the early 1980s 
researchers calculated their lifetime exposure to cigarette smoke 
and compared it with that of healthy nonsmokers 
the researchers calculated each persons smokeryears the 
number of years they lived in a house multiplied by the number of 
smokers there for instance someone who lived at home for 18 years 
with two smoking parents had an exposure of 36 smokeryears 
the study found that exposure of 25 or more smokeryears during 
childhood and adolescence doubles the risk of lung cancer 
twentyseven percent of the cancer victims had this level of 
exposure compared with 15 percent of the healthy comparison group 
household exposure of less than 25 exposureyears while growing 
up did not appear to increase the risk of lung cancer 
exposure to a husband or wifes smoke made up less than a third 
of total household exposure on average and it was not linked with 
an increased risk munzer said this might be explained by the fact 
that spouses who work spend relatively few waking hours together at 
home so their exposure to smoke is short 
while the study did not examine the effects of passive smoking 
on the heart some believe this may be an even more important 
hazard in other work glantz has calculated that secondhand smoke 
may cause 10 times as much heart disease as lung disease 
this would make passive smoking the third leading cause of 
preventable death behind active smoking and alcohol abuse

arcadia is finally cashing in on bonnie and 
clyde 56 years after the outlaws were blown away in a police 
ambush outside town 
visitors will stroll barrow boulevard trigger trail and ambush 
alley during a monthly flea market that begins here sept 14 the 
threeday bonnie amp clyde trade days will include booths set up by 
more than 500 dealers 
were not famous for anything else around here and the names 
of bonnie parker and clyde barrow are known nationwide said 
lamar ozley a lawyer and investor in the project we just hope 
we can draw as many people as bonnie and clyde the day their bodies 
were hauled into town 
about 20000 people crowded arcadia that day in 1934 after clyde 
barrow and bonnie parker lowlife killers made into tragic heroes 
by the warren beattyfaye dunaway movie died in their tan 1934 
ford deluxe in a hail of gunfire eight miles outside town 
the mortuary was in the back end of a furniture store said 
william dees 83 whose father ran a nearby bank i went in 
there the people actually tore up the furniture standing on it 
walking on it to get a look at the bodies 
arcadia has a population of about 3000 but it had only 700 
when bonnie and clyde died 
situated in northcentral louisiana arcadia was a good hideout 
area for bandits in the 1930s us 80 was their interstate and 
bienville parish was near the arkansas line and about an hours 
drive from texas for criminals who didnt care about speed limits 
four texas lawmen had trailed parker and barrow through a 
halfdozen states finally getting a break when a bienville parish 
farmer ivey methvin offered to set up an arrest in exchange for 
dropping charges against his son henry henry ran with bonnie and 
clyde 
the texans joined by bienville parish sheriff henderson jordan 
and his deputy prentiss oakley hid by the side of highway 154 
near the methvin farm on may 23 1934 when the outlaws auto came 
by the officer fired more than 100 rounds 
prentiss told me the ambush bothered him recalled homer 
oakley brother of the late deputy the fact is if he ever drank 
much before then i didnt know about it but after the ambush 
everybody knows he started drinking 
i think prentiss and the sheriff aged overnight said hugh 
watson retired chairman of premier bank in shreveport they were 
never the same after that 
watson 17 at the time said he worked in an arcadia sandwich 
shop and served bonnie and clyde the night before they were killed 
we werent busy so i sat on the curb while they sat in the car 
and ate we chatted she asked if i had a comb i got her one and 
she combed her hair he said both of them were polite 
ordinary looking though she had kind of a coarse look 
watson said he discovered their identities the next day when 
their pictures appeared in the shreveport journal 
people must have read the paper and heard it on the radio 
because arcadia filled up he said the car was hauled into 
town with the bodies still inside people were taking pieces off 
the car for souvenirs 
one girl i went to school with wound up with one of bonnies

a red carpet is rolled up just inside 
the main entrance of the hotel housing kuwaits 
governmentinexile primed to be slapped across the glossy marble 
for any passing head of state 
the hotel near this mountain resort in southwestern saudi arabia 
is home and headquarters for the deposed emir sheik jaber alahmed 
alsabah and the entire cabinet 
nearly all senior government officials escaped when iraq invaded 
on aug 2 
visitors to the hotel about 50 miles east of mecca have instant 
access to a whole battery of ministers they probably could not have 
reached by telephone in kuwait before the invasion 
you want three ministers in an exclusive interview a 
diplomat acting as a press liaison officer asks before presenting 
the ministers of health housing and municipal affairs for a 
15minute chat in the lobby 
most activity centers around an upstairs conference room on the 
same floor as the emirs suite 
arabic wire service stories about cabinet ministers on the road 
and expressions of support for kuwait are pasted across a bulletin 
board outside the room 
the one constant on the board is a photocopied newspaper picture 
of president saddam hussein of iraq hugging a detained child next 
to one of hitler in virtually the same pose history repeats 
itself is scrawled under it with red felt marker 
the television in the outer reception room is tuned to cnn 
press visits are easily arranged through an american public 
relations firm that was hired after saddams frequent television 
appearances convinced the cabinet that their seclusion was losing 
them the sound bite battle 
traffic into the cabinet room can be fierce aides scurrying 
between a battalion of facsimile machines jostle for space with 
whitejacketed waiters pushing carts laden with crystal goblets and 
plates of nuts 
everyone rises when a senior member of the royal alsabah family 
passes but otherwise there is little formality 
a reporter conducting an interview in the cabinet room is 
interrupted when someone sticks his head in the door and tells him 
he has a phone call 
go take it says planning minister suleiman almuttawa 
ill be here 
but no one wants to be there for too long and they hope soon to 
return to kuwait about 700 miles to the northeast 
the ministers echo almuttawa in saying were hoping it wont 
extend even a period of months 
the spirit infects the whole building conversations that end at 
lunch with until next time in kuwait are picked up again at 
dinner 
the cabinet eats with everybody else and both meals are 
sumptuous affairs usually involving two whole sheep 
special food carts are wheeled into the suite of the emir who 
has appeared twice on television since the invasion but refuses all 
interview requests and rarely emerges 
a diplomat who met with him as part of his presidents 
delegation said the emir was very much in despair tired and 
despondent he kept saying you lost money but i have lost my 
country 
cabinet ministers days center around dealing with refugee 
problems trying to monitor events inside kuwait and planning for 
reconstruction 
derogatory nicknames for saddam and the iraqis creep into all 
conversations ranging from madman to the new tatars a 
reference to the hordes that swept out of asia in the 13th century 
and pillaged culturally advanced islamic cities 
cabinet members bristle at any reference to support for saddam 
from other arab countries 
we havent come to power over the dead bodies of our 
compatriots stormed almuttawa 
the word palestinian brings a grimace due to the palestine 
liberation organizations support for baghdad 
almuttawa says there is a sense of shame and frustration 
among the ministers for having lost kuwaits independence even 
when they heard about the invasion they thought iraq would stop 
just inside the border and try to negotiate its land and oil 
demands 
but the ministers can also joke about their plight 
when someone mentions a chronic lack of hotel rooms one pipes 
up delegate that to the housing minister

american journalist terry anderson has 
marked his 2000th day in captivity with no new word on whether he 
may be released soon 
anderson 42yearold chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press reached the grim milestone on wednesday 
he is among six americans four britons two west germans and 
one italian held captive in lebanon most are held by proiranian 
shiite moslem militants 
anderson of lorain ohio was kidnapped in moslem west beirut 
on march 16 1985 by islamic jihad or islamic holy war 
the latest report on him came from former irish hostage brian 
keenan who said after his release aug 24 that he had seen 
anderson during his four years in captivity 
i saw terry anderson some time ago hes in good form 
keenan said after he was freed by a group calling itself the 
organization of islamic dawn 
the irishman said he spent part of his time in captivity with 
anderson noting they were in chains and blindfolded much of the 
time 
keenan said anderson appreciates the letters that he received 
from his family he has a picture of his daughter sulome which is 
some great companionship for him 
sulome andersons younger daughter has never met her father 
she was born nearly three months after he was kidnapped 
lebanese newspapers have published several pictures and letters 
from sulome her lebanese mother madeleine and the hostages 
sister peggy say 
in dublin the papal nuncio to ireland pleaded with irans 
outgoing ambassador on wednesday to undertake all possible efforts 
to obtain the release of the remaining western hostages in lebanon 
i am certain that you will do all in your power to see that 
innocent human beings of no matter what nationality held 
captive against their will shall be enabled to regain the freedom 
the dignity to which they have a right archbishop emmanuel 
gerada said during a farewell reception for iranian ambassador 
bahram ghassemi 
ghassemi who is taking up a post in the iranian foreign 
ministry was widely credited with assisting in obtaining the 
release of keenan 
islamic jihad and other shiite kidnappers are linked to 
hezbollah or party of god the fundamentalist movement is irans 
main ally in lebanon and is closely linked with radical figures in 
tehran 
apart from keenan two swiss red cross workers held hostage in 
south lebanon were freed in early august 
islamic dawn freed us hostages robert polhill and frank reed 
10 days apart in april as a goodwill gesture 
but one of the kidnappers reputed mentors said this week the 
situation has changed and that no more americans will be freed 
because of the us military intervention in the persian gulf in 
response to iraqs invasion of kuwait 
if theres going to be a hostage release it will be europeans 
and not americans said hussein musawi who heads a prosyrian 
wing of hezbollah he had announced before polhill and reed were 
freed that they would be released 
the united states has spearheaded the wests occupation of 
saudi arabia after iraqs invasion of kuwait and that has 
eliminated the chance of releasing american hostages in lebanon 
this year he said 
musawi condemned iraqi president saddam husseins invasion of 
kuwait but added we dont believe that saddams aggression 
should be confronted by an american occupation of our lands 
however unconfirmed reports have indicated the iraqi invasion 
could indirectly speed up the release of all western hostages 
witnesses who were in kuwait during the invasion said 15 
proiranian terrorists convicted there in the 1983 bombing of the 
us and french embassies were seen fleeing the central prison 
islamic jihad had demanded the release of the 15 
a shiite source who has close links with hezbollah said two 
lebanese among the 15 believed to be the main focus of islamic 
jihads demands have returned to lebanon since the prison escape 
the story has not been confirmed by the kidnappers or hezbollah 
musawi said european hostages held in lebanon would be in a 
more favorable position than others 
another shiite source who is familiar with irans situation 
said the us deployment in the persian gulf region would hinder 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjanis efforts to pressure the 
kidnappers into releasing the six american captives rafsanjani 
wants to improve irans relations with the west and faces 
opposition by iranian radicals 
but rafsanjanis internal power was consolidated last month when 
saddam fearing for his vulnerable eastern flank with iran agreed 
to withdraw his troops from areas occupied during the 198088 
iraniraq war exchange prisonersofwar and share sovereignty of 
the shattalarab waterway with iran 
this and the apparent escape of the kuwait 15 has raised 
speculation that iran will be better placed to arrange hostage 
releases and that andersons kidnappers have got what they want 
however the shiite source noted that with american soldiers 
deployed in the gulf rafsanjani would have to think twice before 
making any friendly gestures toward washington

president mikhail s gorbachev will come to japan 
in april for the first visit by a soviet leader prime minister 
toshiki kaifu said today 
the timing of the longawaited visit was set today during talks 
between soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and kaifu 
japan broadcasting corp reported 
id like to make it a good start of discussion on a peace 
treaty and territorial issues kaifu was quoted by an aide as 
saying 
a visit by gorbachev is further evidence of warming relations 
between the two countries after a decadeslong chill caused by a 
dispute over islands off northern japan seized by the soviets near 
the end of world war ii 
moscow has rebuffed efforts by japan to regain the islands 
after a third and final round of talks today shevardnadze and 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama signed documents to lay the 
groundwork for the visit 
their agreements also would facilitate japanese technical 
assistance for the ailing soviet economy and aid for victims of the 
1986 chernobyl nuclear disaster 
for years japan has insisted that the small group of sparsely 
populated islands must be returned before there could be any real 
progress in economic or political ties for its part moscow has 
emphasized increased japanese economic cooperation particularly in 
remote siberia 
but both sides now show a willingness to discuss a broad range 
of cooperation while continuing their negotiations on the 
territorial dispute 
it was not immediately clear if any progress had been made on 
the islands issue during shevardnadzes talks with japanese 
officials 
after their first day of talks wednesday the foreign ministers 
issued a joint statement calling for iraq to withdraw immediately 
from kuwait and to release all foreigners being held in the two 
gulf nations 
nakayama urged the soviets to begin a unilateral reduction of 
troops in the far east as they have done in eastern europe a 
japanese foreign ministry official said 
but shevardnadze ruled this out saying troop reductions in the 
far east can be discussed only in the context of the overall 
military balance in the region said the official who briefed 
reporters on condition of anonymity 
instead shevardnadze proposed a series of confidencebuilding 
measures to improve ties including exchanges of military personnel 
and prior notification of large military exercises the official 
said 
nakayama said the two countries should instead focus on their 
fundamental differences in order to reduce their wide gap the 
official added

critics are questioning the morality of 
the navys plan to train naturally playful dolphins to guard 
nuclear submarines 
we are militarizing space and now we have the audacity to 
think we can militarize animals it is insane jeanne clark of 
hempstead ny said at a hearing wednesday night on the navys 
plan to use as many as 16 dolphins to guard its trident subs at 
bangor 
animalrights activists protested military use of dolphins after 
news reports in 1988 citing navy records said 13 dolphins in navy 
training had died from 1986 to 1988 nearly half suffered from lack 
of appetite or stomach ulcers other ailments included hepatitis 
and pneumonia 
the navy recently reported that none of its 142 marine mammals 
had died since june 1989 
animalrights groups sued the navy in april 1989 arguing that 
bringing dolphins to bangor required an environmental impact 
statement under federal law no dolphins are now at bangor eight 
trident subs are stationed there 
the groups dropped the lawsuit in may when the navy agreed to 
conduct the environmental review the assessment is due next 
summer wednesday nights hearing was on its scope 
laurie raymond of the progressive animal welfare society in 
seattle said the assessment should consider scientific questions 
such as the effects of stress and cold water on the warmwater 
dolphins 
most speakers made more emotional arguments 
we are polluting the moral environment said the rev 
gretchen woods of kitsap unitarian universalist association 
les bivens associate head of the biosciences division at the 
naval ocean systems center in san diego said it would be difficult 
to address moral questions in the impact statement 
but he said i do not think the people here have anything to 
worry about whatsoever a federal marine mammal commission 
investigation in 1989 found no major problems in the navys 
dolphintraining program 
in boston meanwhile protests from animalrights activists have 
led an aquarium director to rethink plans to trade an aggressive 
unsociable show dolphin to the navy 
the new england aquarium would have sent rainbow an 11yearold 
male to the secret underwater mammal program at the san diego 
center 
aquarium director john h prescott said wednesday he believed 
the trade would be good for rainbow but he added if its 
causing public concern i must pay attention its not a closed 
issue

the airline industry says it is concerned 
about a rash of retirements among key federal aviation 
administration personnel including air traffic controllers 
the air transport association which represents major carriers 
said wednesday that the agencys loss of 341 people last month 
jeopardizes the faas air traffic control and airways operations 
faa spokesman fred farrar confirmed the figure and said it was 
twice the normal number of retirees for a month he said the 
increase was primarily because of concern over possible changes in 
federal retirement rules 
there are approximately 50000 faa employees 
the bush administration in congressional budget negotiations 
has proposed eliminating a provision that allows employees to get 
back their individual retirement contributions in two annual lump 
sums 
if the rules do change only those who retired 30 days before 
the program expires sept 30 would be eligible to get the lumpsum 
payments 
farrar said it was too early to tell what impact steppedup 
retirements might have on the air control system

the united states will begin collecting 
antidumping duties on synthetic sweaters imported from south 
korea taiwan and hong kong as a result of a decision by the us 
international trade commission 
the commission ruled in a 21 vote wednesday that the imports 
are sold at less than fair value causing material damage to the 
us domestic industry 
the decision means us customs will be ordered to charge duties 
on the imported sweaters the commission said the announcement did 
not give the rates of duty which could bring a combination of 
higher prices for the imports and reduced shipments 
the finding was requested in a petition filed earlier this year 
by the national knitwear and sportswear association a us 
industry group 
the commission said imports accounted for 75 percent of the 149 
million dozen manmade fiber sweaters purchased by us consumers in 
1989 and for 777 percent of total sweater purchases that year of 
339 million dozen 
south korean synthetic sweaters led the 1989 imports with 37 
percent of value and 375 million dozen sweaters followed by 
taiwan with 31 percent and 31 million dozen and hong kong with 12 
percent and 13 million dozen it added

iraq will send foreign minister tariz 
aziz and other officials to iran on sunday the first such 
highlevel visit since war broke out between the two nations 10 
years ago the iraqi news agency reported today 
the news agency did not provide any other details in the 
onesentence announcement 
the visit was agreed to before iraq invaded and annexed kuwait a 
month ago but thanks to concessions iraq has since made it will 
aim to create the conditions for a direct meeting between iraqi 
president saddam hussein and his iranian counterpart hashemi 
rafsanjani 
saddam has wanted such direct talks for years but iran refused 
but last month an increasingly isolated saddam accepted tehrans 
demands for an iraqi withdrawl from territory occupied in the 
closing stages of the iraniraq war which ended in a ceasefire in 
august 1988 
the iraq president also agreed to exchange all prisoners of war 
and share the shattalarab the border waterway that provides iraq 
with its only access to the persian gulf iran had said direct 
talks could begin only after iraq accepted a 1975 treaty 
establishing the shattalarab as the boundary between the two 
countries 
no iraqi foreign minister has visited tehran since the islamic 
revolution which ousted irans shah mohammad reza pahlavi in 1979 
iran has condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait but also has 
criticized the deployment of the usled multinational force in 
the persian gulf it has also called for the removal of foreigners 
from saudi arabia the site of three of islams holiest sites and 
for an arab solution to the conflict 
iran has said it would honor the unimposed embargo on trade 
with iraq along the countries sommon 730mile border 
the iraqi concessions also have strengthened rafsanjanis hand 
against radical opponents diplomats in tehran said in telephone 
interviews rafsanjani has been locked in a power struggle with 
hardliners opposed to contact with the west

at 71 roseland still calls itself the home of 
refined dancing but since disco and hiphop cut in on the 
foxtrot and the chacha trouble has also resided at the nations 
most famous ballroom 
the mirrored lobby which displays the shoes of the greats who 
danced there and the names of spouses who met there also has a 
metal detector and instead of taxi dancers the ballroom now 
employs a battalion of bouncers and guards 
there have been two murders at roseland in the past six years 
16 felonies in or around it this year and increasingly angry 
complaints from neighborhood residents about latenight noise and 
drug use outside the club 
this week opponents found a focus 
a tourist from utah was stabbed to death when a gang of youths 
allegedly robbed his father and used the money for admission to the 
ballroom later in the evening in an unrelated incident a man was 
shot and wounded on the dance floor 
on wednesday the club announced it would end disco programs by 
the end of the month 
ballroom dancing is roselands heart and soul said manager 
hilary feshbach who promised to find alternatives to disco to keep 
the ballroom solvent 
in the early evenings roseland is much the same as ever crowds 
of mostly elderly men and women dance the foxtrot the chacha and 
other ballroom favorites their numbers have steadily declined and 
about 10 years ago roseland started a disco that opened at midnight 
on fridays and saturdays after ballroom dancing ended 
the late show has drawn roughly twice as many dancers as the 
ballroom music but it also attracted a younger more intoxicated 
and more violent crowd 
police inspector lowell stahl calls the change after midnight 
like dr jekyll and mr hyde 
the scene outside is even more troublesome 
its a nightmare says allan abramowitz who lives with his 
wife and young son in an apartment building nearby i invite you 
to stay in my apartment any friday or saturday night between 2 am 
and 6 am youd hear the car boom boxes i live on the 10th floor 
and my windows shake from the bass 
its a different kind of shaking than the kind for which 
roseland is famous 
the ballrooms hall of fame displays shoes worn by betty 
grable george raft gregory hines and bill bojangles robinson 
a plaque bears the names of more than 725 couples who met and 
married there 
roseland opened in a former carriage factory in 1919 and later 
moved into a skating rink legend has it the owner louis brecker 
needed a place to take his fiancee dancing that stayed open longer 
than his native philadelphia permitted 
breckers roseland was lively but orderly house taxi dancers 
partnered patrons for 10 cents a dance but they couldnt accept 
gifts from them jitterbuggers were discouraged from jittering too 
frenetically the twist was banned altogether 
but styles of music and dance continued to change eventually 
roseland gave in to disco in an attempt to cover vast overhead 
we just couldnt fight it said nancy brecker leeds the 
founders daughter who sold the place in 1981 it was all 
around

cambodias vietnambacked government 
has welcomed a us offer to meet and discuss ending nearly 20 
years of civil war but it is unlikely to yield easily on 
relinquishing power to a un administration 
in jakarta indonesia talks scheduled for today involving the 
cambodian government of premier hun sen and representatives of its 
guerrilla foes failed to get off the ground as the parties bickered 
over who should sit at the table secretary of state james baker 
iii told the senate foreign relations committee on wednesday that 
uscambodian talks would be held in the laotian capital of 
vientiane 
he called it the next logical step in us support for peace 
efforts 
us diplomats in bangkok say no date has been set for the 
meeting 
a cambodian official today called it another step forward in 
the solution of the cambodian problem hor nam hong minister 
responsible for external affairs on phnom penhs council of 
ministers spoke to reporters in jakarta 
washington backs the noncommunist resistance forces of prince 
norodom sihanouk and of son sann who are allied with the 
chyinesebacked communist khmer rouge 
the three forcea are battling the government vietnam installed 
in phnom penh after it invaded in late 1978 and toppled the khmer 
rouge which had during a nearly fouryear rule tried to transform 
cambodia into a radical agrarian commune sending nearly 1 million 
people to their deaths 
plans for the talks in jakarta were on the verge of total 
collapse earlier in the week after key figures threatened not to 
come and the meeting did not begin as scheduled today 
but sihanouks son prince norodom ranariddh today said his 
father would come to jakarta on sunday in reponse hor nam hong 
said the premier now plans to arrive friday 
the feared khmer rouge the strongest rebel group on the 
battlefield had threatened to boycott the talks if hun sen and 
sihanouk did not attend 
the talks were expected to focus on formation of a transitional 
government to govern while elections are organized each of the 
four cambodian factions is supposed to be represented on the 
council 
on aug 28 the united states and the other permanent members of 
the un security council britain china france and the soviet 
union adopted a cambodian peace plan under which the world body 
would hold interim authority and disarm and regroup the four armies

officials had succeeded in getting the vietnamese to persuade phnom 
penh to back the un plan

friday in their second round of talks on the cambodian conflict 
solomon said the vietnamese still want the armies to remain in

a man told police he helped his 
cancerstricken wife commit suicide by tying a plastic bag over her 
head to asphyxiate her fearing painkillers she had taken wouldnt 
kill her 
bertram harpers taped statement to a detective was played in a 
courtroom wednesday during a hearing to determine whether he should 
be charged in the aug 19 death of his wife virginia 
i helped my wife carry out her wishes thats all ive done 
the 72yearold california man later told reporters 
harper said once his wife lost consciousness in their motel room 
after taking about a dozen painkillers he pulled the bag over her 
head and tied it around her neck with rubber bands knotted 
together he said he waited about an hour to make sure she was 
dead then called romulus police 
the 30minute audio tape of harpers police statement was played 
during a preliminary hearing on whether sufficient evidence exists 
to try harper on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder 
harper described to police his wifes cancer and their earlier 
commitment to end each others suffering if necessary the couple 
chose to do that in michigan because they understood the state has 
no law against helping someone commit suicide harper said 
harper told police his wife washed down the pills with coffee 
liqueur and lay on the bed while she pulled a clear plastic bag 
over her head he said they removed the bag when she complained it 
was too hot 
harper said they tried to put the bag over her head twice more 
but she kept moving her hands and head harper said he secured the 
bag over his wifes head only after she lost consciousness 
if i hadnt placed the bag i dont know what would have 
happened harper said on the tape eventually she probably 
would perhaps come out of the sleeping pills but then shed 
have been back to square one shed have been back in pain 
a deputy wayne county coroner sawait kanluen testified that 
mrs harper died of asphyxiation 
kanluen said she had liver cancer but neither that nor drugs she 
had taken in the suicide attempt killed her 
harpers lawyer hugh davis denied to reporters that the couple 
came to michigan to carry out their death pact because of the case 
of dr jack kevorkian who helped an oregon woman commit suicide in 
a detroit suburb on june 4 
kevorkian has not been charged prosecutors continue to 
investigate 
harper said he and his wife learned from a book by derek 
humphry executive director of the hemlock society that michigan 
has no law against helping someone commit suicide 
the hemlock society is an organization advocating the right of 
terminally ill people to end their lives when and as they choose 
the society is financing harpers defense 
harper was jailed for a week before a bail bondsman he never met 
posted his 25000 bond district judge henry zaborowski adjourned 
the preliminary hearing until friday

after a decade of study a scientific review 
concludes that acid rain is a long term problem requiring 
tougher pollution controls but is not an environmental crisis 
nevertheless the report released wednesday by the national acid 
precipitation assessment program said steep cuts in sulfur dioxide 
emissions especially from midwest electric utilities will be 
needed to reverse the environmental damage of acid rain 
the report made no recommendation on how steep or how soon the 
reductions should be made it said a cut of 10 million tons of 
annual sulfur dioxide emissions would result in the recovery of 
highly acidic lakes and reverse other environmentally damaging 
conditions 
legislation nearing approval in congress calls for utilities to 
cut annual sulfur dioxide releases by 10 million tons or roughly 
in half by the end of the decade 
the national acid precipitation assessment program was 
established by congress in 1980 to improve understanding of acid 
rain it spent 537 million to conduct its decade of study 
the scientific groups report was embraced by both those who are 
supporting steep cuts in sulfur dioxide emissions as well as 
critics of such cuts 
the critics contend that severe pollution controls costing as 
much as 5 billion a year is an overreaction to the extent of the 
acid rain problem 
the report provides strong evidence that there is time to 
implement more cost effective ways in which to mitigate the limited 
environmental impacts of acid rain said richard lawson 
president of the national coal association 
he maintained the findings show that acid rain does not pose 
an environmental emergency 
thomas kuhn president of the edison electric institute said 
the findings point out that the damage from acid rain is much 
less than was feared in the late 1970s and early 1980s 
but eileen claussen a senior director involved with air 
pollution issues at the environmental protection agency said the 
report clearly establishes the link between sulfur emissions 
and environmental damage and supports the bush administrations 
call for tough pollution controls by coalburning electric 
utilities 
the report acknowledged that acid rain is affecting visibility 
across much of the east causes damage to some forests reduces 
soil nutrients kills some aquatic life erodes buildings and 
statutes and can pose health problems to some humans 
it said that acid rain has shown to be most damaging to aquatic 
systems in the adirondacks of new york state where 14 percent of 
large lakes and nearly a third of the smaller ones were highly 
acidic less of a problem was found elsewhere along the 
midatlantic region and new england 
james mahoney director of the group that conducted the study 
outlined the draft report to a final meeting of the group and said 
its findings have reduced the scientific uncertainties about 
acid rain 
acid rain is correctly viewed as a longterm problem which 
should be resolved by permanent measures he said 
mahoney said that while the study supports many of the 
scientific views expressed over the years on acid rain it also 
rejected other more extreme views such as those who consider it 
a flatout crisis or those who would say theres no problem 
at all

amnesty international said today that death squads 
formed to fight lawlessness in brazilian streets are killing 
children at a rate of about one a day 
the worldwide human rights group said an increasing number of 
homeless children are turning to crime to survive leading to an 
increase in murders by death squads partly manned by offduty 
policemen 
in a report released today the group spoke of hundreds of such 
killings and said there were also many cases of children being 
beaten tortured and mutilated by policemen on duty 
it cited brazilian rights groups for the estimate of a death a 
day 
the organization reminded president fernando collor de mello of 
his pledge june 22 to stamp out the abuses he said we cannot be 
and will not again be a country cited as violent in reports by 
amnesty international 
it said an amnesty delegation met collor last month and asked 
for immediate concrete action to stop the killings 
the report cited the case of three boys picked up in rio de 
janeiro by military police last month on suspicion of trying to 
break into a store it said they were made to play russian 
roulette and a 13yearold leandro cardoso da silva was shot 
in the head and dumped outside a hotel by police he later died 
in hospital 
poor children in brazil are treated with contempt by the 
authorities risking their lives simply by being on the street 
the report said their most basic rights are trampled on by the 
very people who should safeguard them 
it said the death squads kill children to clean up the streets 
remove witnesses or keep an area safe onduty police officers 
have shot youths dead simply for failing to stop their motorcycle 
when signaled to do so or for allegedly insulting a police 
officer 
it said that while some officers and judges deplore the abuses 
the authorities have generally failed to take action the few 
cases that are properly investigated often take years to go to 
trial and result in negligible sentences 
police are sometimes slow to intervene to stop death squad 
abductions as they are taking place when two boys were taken from 
their home by armed men claiming to be police other officers in a 
patrol car refused the mothers request to search for the boys 
they were later found dead 
the report said young people on the streets or in detention are 
routinely tortured and illtreated by police it said the police 
use electric shocks burn children with cigarettes throw hot water 
on them and beat them with truncheons

the federal reserve board has ordered citicorp 
to close its insurance operations in delaware in a decision 
analysts say casts serious doubt on the ability of banks to expand 
into the insurance business 
the decision announced by the fed on wednesday involves family 
guardian life insurance co a company controlled by citicorps 
whollyowned citibank of delaware 
the fed announcement noted that family guardian was acting under 
a new delaware law that permits state chartered banks in delaware 
to conduct broad insurance agency and underwriting activities 
through a separate department or division of the bank or through a 
subsidiary of the bank 
however the fed said it determined that these activities were 
not consistent with the boards regulation governing bank holding 
companies such as citicorp 
the delaware law that took effect in may capped years of debate 
and lobbying by the banking and insurance industries and quickly 
led to the establishment of insurance operations by a number of 
leading banks in delaware 
the fed decision similar to one involving south dakota several 
years ago is in line with the insurance industry arguments that 
state laws are preempted by the federal bank holding company act 
that does not allow a subsidiary of a bank holding company to 
engage in a business that the parent company is not allowed to 
engage in

million including works by picasso and renoir were stolen by 
thieves who lowered themselves into a 5thfloor apartment by rope

returned from work early wednesday police said 
among the works reported stolen were paintings by 19th and 20th 
century masters pablo picasso pierreauguste renoir edgar degas 
amedeo modigliani and edouard manet 
officials initially estimated the value of the stolen paintings 
at nearly 2 million but police said today that the value was 
likely to be much higher 
french press reports suggested there was uncertainty as to the 
origin of the paintings and police said they wanted to talk with 
the apartments owner jacques schwarzfuchs 62 
a retired member of the council of state schwarzfuchs 
reportedly is ill and receiving medical care in the eastern city of 
strasbourg 
according to police the thieves broke through a balcony window 
of the apartment in cannes after lowering themselves by rope from 
the roof two floors above

works in the past two years in cannes and nearby nice 
in december eight oil paintings by henri matisse valued at 
more than 12 million were stolen from a nice apartment the works

nasa engineers embarrassed again by 
a space shuttle that cant fly set off anew today on a hunt 
through a tangle of pipes for an elusive fuel leak that grounded 
columbia for a third time 
it is a real booger to try to find and isolate shuttle boss 
robert crippen said after the mission was scrubbed wednesday 7 
hours before columbia was to have lifted off at 120 am today 
with the 150 million astro observatory 
engineers worked on a troubleshooting plan through the night 
but crippen said that even if the hole is found immediately 
columbia could not leave on its long astronomy mission for at least 
three or four days and probably longer 
weve got pretty good test data from what we did during the 
tanking and detanking of the fuel tank nasa spokesman george 
diller said this morning referring to wednesdays pouring of 
hydrogen into the halfmilliongallon fuel tank 
weve been looking at it all night and we will have some 
educated guesses later in the afternoon he said 
because there are some propellants still on board repair crews 
will not be able to enter the tail section of the orbiter until 
late afternoon he said at that time nasa has scheduled a 
briefing for reporters by administrator richard truly and the top 
man in the agencys space flight program william lenoir 
the launch would have been the 36th shuttle flight and the first 
in four months after a summer of similar leaks for nasa that is 
the longest gap between missions since flights resumed following 
the challenger disaster 
nasa thought it had cured columbia of leaks by installing new 
plumbing between the orbiter and its huge tank crippen said the 
leak that forced the first launch postponement in may was gone 
but another leak appeared wednesday inside the rear compartment 
i think this leak has been there all along he said 
trying to isolate it out from the other leak confused the 
data 
my first reaction was frustration said program scientist ed 
weiler but my next thought was my god im glad they stopped 
some of my friends are aboard hydrogen is highly combustiblle 
the seven columbia crewmen left for their training base in 
houston at dawn 
we will be ready when columbia is fixed said commander 
vance brand 
the shuttles rear compartment is a maze of pipes pumps and 
valves that feed three huge engines which push the shuttle into 
orbit once its booster rockets are spent 
we do not consider that the vehicle is safe to fly crippen 
said 
it was the second scrub in less than a week last thursday a 
day before the scheduled launch launch control found that it could 
not communicate with one of the four telescopes in columbias cargo 
bay that problem was fixed over the weekend 
the telescopes designed to study stars galaxies and other hot 
objects was supposed to have gone up in a shuttle in march 1986 
but all flights were postponed because of the challenger disaster 
two months earlier 
columbia must be on its way by sept 14 or face yet another 
delay the shuttle discovery on a neighboring launch pad has 
priority for a flight that must take place between oct 5 and oct 
23 to send a probe winging toward orbit around the sun the 
alignment of planets for that mission wont be right again for 13 
months 
wednesdays countdown was stopped as technicians noticed an 
alarming buildup of hydrogen while the fuel was pouring into the 
shuttle tank at the rate of 8400 gallons a minute 
the concentration of hydrogen was 10 times over the limit when 
officials called a halt they continued filling the tank trying 
without success to isolate the leak 
the problem is another in a series that began with the launch of 
the hubble space telescope in april the 15 billion telescope was 
supposed to see to the beginning of the universe instead it needs 
corrective lenses that cant be put on by astronauts until 1993 
in may the columbia leak was discovered during fueling and the 
shuttle was trundled back to its hangar for tests and a new 
connecting pipe the old one was found to be contaminated with tiny 
glass beads that made a path for leaking gas 
in june a fueling test on sister ship atlantis showed it too 
had holes and the entire threeshuttle fleet was grounded 
last month the magellan space probe went into orbit around 
venus after a 158millionmile trip that began in may 1989 the 
euphoria was dampened when engineers twice lost touch with the 
probe they said wednesday that magellan will start mapping the 
surface of venus later this month even if they dont figure out 
the communications blackouts 
vice president dan quayle alluded to nasas problems a few hours 
before the scrub in a televised speech to nasa employees from the 
johnson space center in texas he said the space agency is up to 
doing the job it was assigned to do 
take it from a guy who knows a lot about unwarranted 
criticism he said once they pile it on they just dont know 
when to stop

rep tommy robinson criticized the 
legal system after the us supreme court upheld a stay of 
execution for a convicted murderer who contends robinson beat a 
confession out of him while sheriff 
these legal maneuvers could go on for years robinson said 
in a statement issued through a spokesman rex nelson 
the time has come for congress to limit the number of appeals 
that can be filed by those on death rows across the country he 
said 
barry lee fairchild 36 was spared execution by injection 
wednesday when the high court declined to lift a stay granted the 
day before by a federal appeals court 
fairchild was convicted in the 1983 slaying of air force nurse 
marjorie mason 
also wednesday the fbi confirmed it was investigating reports 
of civil rights abuse by the pulaski county sheriffs office which 
robinson headed when fairchild was arrested 
the fbi wouldnt say if the investigation covered the period 
when robinson was sheriff 
fairchilds attorneys have contended in appeals that he was 
beaten into confessing by robinson and his deputies robinson a 
republican denies the allegations 
i am tired of attorneys who waste a courts time and waste our 
tax money robinson said in the statement i also am tired of 
groups that try to make heroes of convicted murderers and rapists 
the rights of barry lee fairchild were never violated 
robinson said he would work in the closing days of the 
congressional session for passage of a bill limiting federal court 
appeals his tenure in congress ends in january because he chose to 
run for governor instead of for reelection 
robinson lost the gop gubernatorial primary in may 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
ordered us district judge g thomas eisele to look at new 
evidence presented by fairchilds attorneys 
among the evidence are affidavits from four black men who claim 
they were accused of ms masons slaying and were beaten by 
robinson or his deputies 
eisele said he will consider the new evidence nov 13 
assistant attorney general jack gillean said three of the four 
men who submitted affidavits were suspects in the 1983 murder he 
said police questioned the men days before fairchild was arrested 
and questioned 
hall said the existence of the other suspects wasnt revealed to 
the lawyer for fairchild at his trial joe obryan such 
information could have helped convince the jury that police 
rounded up blacks and beat on them until they elected which one was 
the best one to be charged hall said 
gillean said he was told by the pulaski county sheriffs office 
that the information about the three suspects was in the department 
case file and has no reason to believe it was withheld 
obryan said he hadnt known at the time of any other witnesses 
who might testify about coercion

the usually raucous ride to the mess 
hall was quieter this noon as sgt williams words sank in 
we dont have time for any attitudes he told his men all 
neighbors from around allendale sc an attitude is going to get 
people hurt when were over there were on the same team and its 
time to act like a team 
the short lecture before lunch was just another sign that things 
are getting serious for the 14 members of the 265th quartermaster 
detachment 
the water purification unit from the south carolina national 
guard trained hard this past week for deployment to the mideast 
but now the pace is even harder 
the men go about the days activities wearing gas mask packs and 
web gear to get used to the weight their forestpatterned battle 
dress fatigues have been exchanged for desert camouflage 
every early morning session of pt physical training sees 
more miles run a subject of mild grumbling among the unit where 
the average age is 35 
if saddam hussein was chasing your ass across the desert youd 
all do another five miles chided capt robert appiah the 
regular army officer preparing the men for overseas 
every night goes a little later as the 265th commander sgt 
ronnie jackson pushes his men to practice radio communications 
chemical protection and field operations 
for williams the second in command it is a question of 
survival 
called john by his men and his superiors the usually smiling 
noncommissioned officer has been less cheerful these last few days 
you realize what could happen and it makes you more serious 
said the 42yearold father of three 
williams a computer programmer is the only member of the unit 
who experienced combat he has shrapnel scars in his back to remind 
him of the ambushes and firefights in vietnam they give him an 
appreciation of training and teamwork 
i could get knocked off or ronnie could get knocked off so 
its important that everybody learn to do every job he said in 
his soft voice youve got to look at every man as the one who 
might have to take over 
the push to get ready has had its casualties for spc henry 
harris the 51yearold retired teacher it was sore knees sgt 
bill bostick 42 has a bad back sgt earnest deloach reinjured a 
hamstring all three were given light duty after being forced to 
report to sick call

there was no way i was going to go if that was the case

after giving blood for an aids test a requirement of all troops 
facing deployment spc ulysses calhoun stretched out on a couch 
and suggested he might need a long rest someone asked if he would 
like cookies and juice 
no said calhoun i believe a big tbone and a 12pack 
will fix up my blood just right 
still for every light moment there is a reminder of the future 
after lunch the 265th joined hundreds of reservists for a general 
briefing at the posts movie theater when it ended the unit was 
asked to stay for a briefing on saudi arabia 
the reservists filed out some stopping to wish the unit luck

president roh taewoo told north 
koreas prime minister today during a historic meeting that he 
hoped for a summit soon that could set the stage for korean 
unification before the end of the century 
korea cannot remain the last divided nation on earth 
separated by cold war roh said 
the two countries prime ministers wound up two days of formal 
talks today without any major agreements but seoul officials said 
privately they were not displeased south koreas goal had been to 
open up dialogue with the communist north 
another round of discussions between the two nations is 
scheduled for oct 1619 in the north korean capital of pyongyang 
rohs meeting with prime minister yon hyong muk marked the first 
time a leader of south korea has received an official 
representative of the rival north korean government 
to effectively solve pending issues between the south and the 
north the top leaders of both sides should meet as soon as 
possible and set the framework for mutual cooperation roh said 
according to an aide 
the meeting was the climax of talks between the two koreas 
prime ministers on easing political and military tensions 
discussions at the highest level between the rival states since the 
division of the peninsula in 1945 
the first prime ministers meeting in 45 years should be a 
starting point for unification roh said to achieve 
unification in this century authorities of south and north korea 
should continue dialogue and open the way for unification 
with south korean prime minister kang younghoon also attending 
roh met the north korean prime minister for about 20 minutes said 
lee soojung spokesman for the president afterwards roh spoke 
with six other north korean delegates and three of their aides 
meanwhile sporatic protests were staged to coincide with the 
meetings some of the protests demanded the withdrawal of 43000 
us troops stationed in south korea saying their presence hinders 
dialogue on unification 
about two dozen radical students unfurled a unification banner 
and tossed antiamerican leaflets outside a hotel where south 
korean political leaders held a dinner eight people were arrested 
about 500 radical students yelling antius and antigovernment 
slogans clashed with police outside seouls kunkuk university at 
cheju university in southern korea about 300 students fought 
police with firebombs for an hour protesting anticommunist 
security laws news reports said 
in southern kwangju city students burned an american flag in 
front of a us air force facility according to news reports 
earlier in the day five dissidents were arrested when they 
tried to enter the hotel where the meetings were held they wanted 
to deliver a letter to the premiers 
one of the five was the wife of suh kyungwon a former 
opposition legislator sentenced to prison for 10 years illegally 
visiting north korea 
in the final meeting north korea reiterated its demands that 
south korea release jailed dissidents halt a joint us military 
exercise and stop efforts to seek its own seat in the united 
nations said an official speaking on condition of anonymity 
the joongang daily news said south korea had offered to discuss 
the three issues if certain conditions were met but that north 
korea did not immediately accept 
the newspaper quoted unidentified officials as saying south 
korea offered to consider a suspension of the team spirit military 
exercise with us forces if north korea was willing to remove 
offensive forces along the heavily armed korean border 
the newspaper also said south korea agreed to consider releasing 
dissidents jailed for traveling illegally to the north if the north 
agreed to sign accords permitting travel mail and transportation 
between the two nations 
the paper said south korea had offered to delay applying for 
un membership a major point of contention 
both nations each claiming to represent the entire peninsula 
have permanent observer status at the united nations

most americans would flunk a test of basic 
knowledge about sex says a new survey thats old news to sex 
experts 
fiftyfive percent of people surveyed could not get at least 10 
of the 18 questions right in the test designed by the kinsey 
institute 
half didnt know that a woman can become pregnant while having 
her period the report said half also did not know that oilbased 
lubricants like petroleum jelly shouldnt be used with condoms or 
diaphragms such substances can erode microscopic holes in condoms 
or diaphragms the kinsey report said 
half the respondents incorrectly believed anal intercourse 
itself can cause aids even if neither partner is infected by the 
virus nearly 30 percent incorrectly said that menopause causes 
most women to lose interest in sex and only 35 percent knew that 
problems with achieving erections usually begin with physical 
causes 
im not surprised at all by the poor showing virginia 
johnson masters director of the masters amp johnson institute in st 
louis said in a telephone interview 
she said people just do not seem to absorb factual information 
they hear about sex unless a sexrelated problem affects them or a 
family member or friend or they are health professionals who deal 
with sexual problems or they have a good understanding of sexual 
function and behavior 
the results also made sense to debra haffner executive director 
of the sex information and education council of the us a 
nonprofit organization that promotes sex education 
the group believes that until there is comprehensive sexuality 
education for all people from childhood through adulthood that we 
will continue to see this alarming degree of sexual ignorance that 
causes both personal pain as well as significant disease and 
dysfunction she said 
kinsey institute director june reinisch said wednesday the 
questions were drawn from those most often asked of the institute 
they represent facts that people need to know for both their 
physical health and their mental health she said 
nearly every question affects peoples feelings about 
themselves their selfesteem she said a recurring theme in 
questions asked of her she said is am i normal the reason 
we dont know whats normal is that were not taught whats going 
on 
among the polls other findings only about 25 percent knew that 
the typical american has first intercourse at age 16 to 17 or that 
an estimated 30 percent to 40 percent of married men have had an 
extramarital affair 
and only 21 percent knew that more than a quarter of american 
men have had a sexual experience with another male as a teenager 
or adult 
poll results emphasize a need for sex education of preteen 
children and of medical school students because the poll found 
people turn to doctors for sex information reinisch said 
less than 20 percent of poll participants got at least 12 
questions right and only five people out of the 1974 polled 
answered at least 16 questions correctly reinisch said 
participants from the midwest generally scored best with 55 
percent passing followed by 47 percent in the west and 40 percent 
in the south and northeast she said 
overall there were no differences in accuracy by sex but men 
did better in questions about rates of sexual behavior and women in 
questions about sexual health care and contraception reinisch said 
the poll is described in a new book the kinsey institute new 
report on sex at a news conference reinisch said the poll was 
financed by book publisher st martins press and the kinsey 
institute for research in sex gender and reproduction 
in addition the roper organization which conducted the poll 
was very generous she said 
the poll involved facetoface interviews with a nationally 
representative sample of americans done last october as part of a 
larger roper survey twelve questions were answered on a 
questionnaire that a person slipped into an envelope before 
returning to the interviewer 
the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points the 
overall percentages exclude 263 participants who answered 10 or 
fewer of the 18 items the remaining participants were still a 
representative sample reinisch said

investigators in the slayings of five 
gainesville students today searched the apartment of an 18yearold 
parttime student charged with beating his grandmother 
alachua sheriffs lt spencer mann also said that 180 miles 
away in indialantic task force investigators also were searching 
the home of edward lewis humphreys grandmother as well as his 
black cadillac parked there 
the searches were begun simultaneously at about 930 am 
mann said mann said search warrants were obtained late wednesday 
and would remain sealed temporarily 
today was the first time investigators have acknowledged 
obtaining search warrants in the case they have said humphrey is 
one of eight suspects 
the gainesville sun reported in todays editions that 
investigators on wednesday searched a gainesville best western 
motel room where humphreys mother had stayed in august 
investigators released no details on that search 
humphreys attorneys were in court this morning asking a brevard 
county judge to reduce humphreys 1 million bond he was arrested 
aug 30 on a charge of aggravated assault after he allegedly 
battered his 79yearold grandmother 
an initial bond of 10000 was increased after task force 
investigators said he was a possible suspect in gainesville 
investigators have refused to confirm a miami herald report 
wednesday that the five college students bodies were posed for 
maximum shock value 
police have previously said without elaboration that the 
killer appeared to have left taunting messages for them in the 
way he arranged evidence at the scene 
meanwhile an expert who examined the offcampus apartments for 
fingerprints with a hightech lightintensifying device said the 
killer was methodical and cautious and had left practically no 
evidence behind 
four women and a man all students at the university of florida 
or santa fe community college were slain last month in three 
attacks that terrorized the town three victims were mutilated one 
of the three was decapitated police said 
the killer placed the severed head in the direct line of vision 
of anyone entering the apartment and positioned a mirror in an 
apartment to show another victims body to anyone who happened to 
look in the window the herald said 
the killer also poured bleach onto the genitals of the four 
women victims in an apparent attempt to confuse investigators about 
whether they were sexually assaulted the newspaper said citing 
unidentified sources 
police would not confirm the report and have refused to say 
whether the victims were sexually assaulted 
on monday however police capt rb ward said in the scene 
the setup there was a message to law enforcement to whoever 
he was very calculated very methodical in the way the person 
did things as well as left things 
after examining the apartments for fingerprints dr michael 
west a deputy medical examiner and forensic dentist from 
hattiesburg miss said wednesday ive never been associated 
with a crime scene that had so many violent attacks and so little 
evidence left behind 
this individual that perpetrated these crimes is not your 
average criminal west said hes very methodical and very 
neat he doesnt leave any traces of his presence in the crime 
scenes 
he said he turned up prints but that they probably belonged to 
residents of the apartments he said he was certain the killer left 
no prints 
only humphrey and stephen michael bates a 30yearold lakeland 
shortorder cook have been mentioned publicly as suspects bates 
has been held in the polk county jail on 100500 bail since his 
aug 29 arrest in an unrelated assault case 
about 600 people attended a memorial service for the victims 
wednesday 
michael browne student body president said this hurt so 
badly because the people taken from us were just like us 
the victims were christa hoyt 19 sonja larson 18 christina

council official oliver norths involvement in the scheme and the 
type of supplies being sent to the contras 
whether a jury would believe fernandezs defense is 
speculation but to preclude the jury from considering evidence 
relevant to this defense would be to deprive him of fundamental 
constitutional protections said the opinion by judge j harvie 
wilkinson iii he was joined by judges william w wilkins jr and 
robert f chapman 
the 40page opinion deletes numerous mentions of sensitive 
national security information 
us district judge claude m hilton of alexandria dismissed the 
case last november after the government refused to submit the 
classified material sought by fernandez 
the former cia station chief had been indicted on two counts of 
lying to investigators and two counts of obstructing justice he 
was accused of telling investigators that a costa rican airstrip 
was for training that countrys military in case of an invasion by 
nicaragua when in fact the airstrip was used to illegally resupply 
the contras 
he also was accused of falsely saying he did not know of norths 
involvement and did not know that supplies he helped deliver to the 
contras in 1986 contained military aid 
fernandez asked to disclose nearly 5000 classified documents at 
his trial

sexual straying sometimes hits in high ecclesiastical circles 
jarring officialdom and the rank and file 
when an ordinary priest or minister gets involved in a sexual 
tangle a frequent occurrence according to studies its scarcely 
noticed and often not publicly at all 
but reactions are intense when it happens to high magisterial 
prelates as shown by several recent cases careers are toppled and 
questions swarm about why the respected churchmen let it happen 
its individually complicated but its related to the 
collapse of the clerical culture a collapsing of all hierarchical 
structures said eugene kennedy a noted roman catholic 
psychologist 
supports to a celibate life of authority prestige and 
privilege were given when the hierarchical structure functioned 
but these do not exist anymore the rules become more difficult to 
see and the role is blurred 
under the circumstances he added in a telephone interview 
these kinds of failures wouldnt surprise me 
while deviation from the celibacy rule marked recent cases of 
notable roman catholics and that of a greek orthodox bishop it was 
an extramarital affair that tripped up an eminent protestant 
leader 
the rev allen boesak 44 a renowned antiapartheid leader in 
south africa resigned aug 10 as president of the world alliance 
of reformed churches after admitting a sexual liaison with a 
television producer 
a prophet is human and gets scared the repeatedly jailed 
and threatened boesak once told american presbyterians a prophet 
fails often he can give in to temptation and if that happens who 
will confront the world 
other prominent cases include 
roman catholic archbishop eugene a marino 56 of atlanta 
the first black archbishop in the american hierarchy resigned july 
10 after revelations of a twoyear intimate relationship with a 
young woman singer and lay minister 
the rev bruce ritter 63 founder of new york citys covenant 
house and a multimilliondollar string of shelters for young 
runaways resigned last february after accusations of sexual 
affairs by male youths an investigative report released in august 
found he had a consistent pattern of sexual misconduct 
greek orthodox bishop anthimos 57 resigned as head of the 
churchs denver diocese in 1987 at the behest of patriarch 
dimitrios i of istanbul turkey after the bishop was accused of 
seducing a priests daughter and keeping her in sexual 
servitude 
in greek orthodoxy priests are allowed to marry but bishops 
are vowed to celibacy as are roman catholic priests and bishops 
these four cases involved ecclesiastical heavyweights with 
honored positions and powerful influence in their churches a 
different level than the promotional tv preachers snared in sex 
scandals 
jim bakker 49 who left his ptl network in 1987 after 
revelations of extramarital sex with former church secretary 
jessica hahn and hush money paid to her was sentenced last fall to 
45 years in prison for defrauding contributors 
jimmy swaggart on his tv show in 1988 tearfully confessed 
moral failure and a new orleans prostitute recounted paid 
sessions with him 
both swaggart and bakker were defrocked by the assemblies of 
god swaggart after refusing a yearlong disciplinary suspension 
the tv preachers focused on their own individual followings of 
mostly impersonal and remote audiences contrast distinctly with 
highranking church dignitaries but none is immune to sex scandal 
the us protestant and eastern orthodox establishment of the 
national council of churches was rocked in 1983 when former united 
bishop james armstrong resigned both as bishop and as council 
president saying he had failed his family and the gospel later 
indicating female involvement 
a brilliant leading member of the french roman catholic 
hierarchy cardinal jean danielou 69 died of a brain hemorrhage 
in 1974 in the paris apartment of a young gogo dancer and 
prostitute 
police and church authorities tried to hush it up but abandoned 
the attempt after a french weekly published details danielou was 
carrying much cash and some theorized he hoped to buy her freedom 
from racketeers using her for prostitution 
kennedy a muchpublished professor at loyola university in 
chicago said that clergymen as trusted counselors of distressed 
people seeking solace are susceptible to sexual involvement if 
they arent careful 
this is common in all the helping professions he said 
whenever someone has an emotional need they quickly transfer 
that need to the person helping but counselors are trained to 
understand whats happening 
thats what it means to be professional to accept someones 
problem without being entangled in it if they are then they are 
no longer able to help

a judge ruled today that an art gallery and 
its director must stand trial later this month on obscenity charges 
for displaying five sexually graphic photographs by robert 
mapplethorpe 
dennis barrie and the contemporary arts center already were 
scheduled to go on trial sept 24 each on one misdemeanor charge of 
using children in material involving nudity the obscenity case 
will be heard the same day 
in his ruling today hamilton county municipal judge david 
albanese rejected a defense request to dismiss the obscenity 
charge defense lawyers had contended that the pictures were a 
legitimate art exhibition and immune from ohios obscenity law 
that is contrary to the law albanese said the 
affirmative defenses and issues of credibility are for the trier of 
the case to decide 
albanese today also granted a prosecution request to limit the 
obscenity case to the five photographs described in the indictment 
against barrie and the center 
he rejected defense claims that the jury had to consider all of 
the photos in the exhibition including shots of flowers and 
sculpture because the show was a survey of mapplethorpes life 
a photograph makes an immediate impression albanese said 
the court finds that each photograph has a separate identity 
he said prosecutors only have to prove that one of the 
photographs is obscene to win a conviction 
among photographs at issue in the case are separate shots of a 
boy and a girl with their genitals exposed 
the maximum penalty for each charge is a 1000 fine and six 
months in jail for barrie and 5000 fine for the contemporary arts 
center 
the charges were filed april 7 the day the sixweek exhibition 
opened to the public the exhibition closed may 26 after 81000 
people had visited the gallery 
the mapplethorpe exhibition opened aug 1 at the institute for 
contemporary art in boston a court clerk in that city on wednesday 
refused a request to file obscenity charges

sen joseph r biden jr agreed today with the 
bush administration that advances have been made in the war against 
drugs but said the situation still remains far worse than it was a 
few years ago 
its been a year since the administration announced its 
national drug control strategy and i think youve made some great 
progress biden ddel chairman of the judiciary committee 
told national drug control policy director william j bennett 
however biden said we have a way to go to get even to the 
84 level much less dealing with this problem 
were not saying the war is over were certainly not 
saying it will be over soon bennett responded 
president bush had said wednesday i think america is making 
progress against drugs and will continue to do so 
bush and bennett released a document showing declines in 
emergency room admissions for cocaine and heroin surveys showing 
americans increasing hostility toward illegal drugs and increases 
in prices for cocaine and reductions in its purity indicating a 
reduction in supply 
the statistics indicate the wholesale price of a kilo of cocaine 
now ranges from 17500 to 35000 up from a range of 11000 to 
25000 last year 
but biden noted that the wholesale price in 1984 was 40000 to 
50000 
in addition he said while the number of cocainerelated 
emergency room cases declined slightly last year to 42145 at 
hospitals checked by the federal government those emergency rooms 
had only 10248 cocainerelated cases in 1985 
bennett asked biden if he could persuade his colleagues on 
capitol hill to continue their pattern of giving the drug war even 
more money than the administration requested itll be a hell of 
a lot harder to do it this year than it was last year or the year 
before biden said 
on wednesday bush told staff aides and reporters that after a 
year there is still too much violence too much destruction too 
many innocent victims 
he said drugs remain an international menace but declared 
that his administration would remain on the front lines until 
this scourge is licked for good 
the judiciary committee issued a report on wednesday hailing as 
a major success an increase in spending on justice department 
efforts to combat drugs to more than 38 billion this year 15 
billion over the 1989 level 
the report also pointed to increases in drug agents cocaine 
prices and criminal convictions 
among major failures though it listed cuts in the ranks of the 
border patrol and other agencies as well as relaxed controls on 
some military assaultstyle weapons tied to the drug trade 
the mixed review ranged from praise for expanded treatment 
facilities to concern that the administration may have undercounted 
by as much as two thirds the number of hardcore cocaine addicts 
which it put at 24 million 
rep john conyers dmich told a news conference that bush and 
bennett cannot deny that we are losing the drug war in our inner 
cities 
prevention and education efforts directed at the educated 
middleclass appear to be having a dramatic effect said conyers 
who chairs the house government operations committee treatment 
programs have room for clients who can afford to pay 
however the chronically addicted cannot pay when they are 
poor and unemployed as is often the case the lawmaker from 
detroit added 
new york city police commissioner lee brown told the judiciary 
committee that initial enthusiasm over the war on drugs was 
dampened by a lack of federal aid to local police 
he said new york was designated a highintensity drug area 
under the program and thus made eligible for increased funding but 
he said none of the 4 million in additional aid went directly to 
local police 
los angeles police chief daryl gates said the drug strategy 
may not be perfect but i think it is a good one he said the 
price of cocaine is up while the quality may be deteriorating as a 
result of the war against drugs 
but both officials said heroin overshadowed in recent years by 
the cocaine plague is now making a comeback on the streets of 
their cities 
brown said heroin seizures skyrocketed 80 percent in new york 
last year and are up 20 percent this year gates said the figures 
were similar in los angeles and described the phenomenon as an 
unintended consequence of the war against cocaine

a former union president whose gun was used to 
kill two antimarcos activists in 1981 has been arrested in the 
slayings police said today 
constantine tony baruso was president of the alaska cannery 
workers union when gene viernes and silme domingo were gunned down 
in the union offices in seattle on june 1 1981 
baruso was arrested at his home in tacoma late wednesday on a 
warrant charging him with two counts of aggravated firstdegree 
murder seattle police spokesman mark amundson said 
dan donahoe a spokesman for the prosecutors office said he 
would not give details of the charges but said a news conference 
would be held later in the day 
baruso was being held in the king county jail on 500000 bail 
barusos attorney anthony savage said that he was surprised at 
the arrest but that the criminal charges would give baruso an 
opportunity to clear his name 
baruso who told authorities the gun used in the case had been 
stolen from him was never previously charged criminally in the 
case but was found liable for millions of dollars in damages in a 
federal lawsuit brought by the victims families 
three men members of a filipino gang called tulisan were found 
guilty of murder at the original criminal trial prosecutors in 
that case argued the killings stemmed from an internal union 
dispute in which domingo and viernes were working to end 
gangdominated gambling in alaska fish canneries 
in the civil lawsuit however family members contended the 
slayings were ordered from manila because of domingos and viernes 
activism against the martiallaw regime of thenphilippines 
president ferdinand marcos 
a us district court jury last december awarded the families 
151 million from marcos estate and from his widow imelda us 
district judge barbara rothstein later found baruso and marcos 
friend dr leonilo malabed of san francisco liable for an 
additional 84 million 
baruso a prominent member of the seattle philippineamerican 
community testified in both the criminal and civil trials but 
repeatedly invoked his fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination 
evidence in the civil trial indicated baruso flew to san 
francisco two weeks before the murders and picked up 15000 from 
malabed who was accused of maintaining a philippines intelligence 
slush fund 
the plaintiffs alleged baruso kept 10000 for himself and gave 
5000 to the triggermen 
authorities identified barusos gun as the murder weapon but 
said baruso told them the weapon had been stolen from him 
baruso was later convicted of embezzling money from the union

american businesses plan to increase spending 
for new plants and equipment just 51 percent over 1989 the 
smallest growth in three years the government said thursday 
analysts said the commerce department survey shows that 
businesses remain leery of a softening economy and worried about 
falling profits 
the department said the survey found businesses planning to 
spend 5269 billion for expansion and modernization this year the 
fourth consecutive year of increased business investment 
but while the projected investment would top last years record 
5016 billion the 51 percent increase would be less than half of 
the 104 percent spending gain in 1989 and the lowest since a 31 
percent advance in 1987 
capital spending rose 95 percent in 1988 
the new estimate also is down from the 55 percent spending 
increase that businesses said they planned in the previous survey 
completed in may 
it confirms the economy is sluggish and expectations for the 
future are that it will continue to be sluggish said economist 
thomas runiewicz of the wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
aftertax corporate profits which rose just 15 percent from 
january through march fell 02 percent in the second quarter and 
many analysts expect them to fall farther in the last half of the 
year 
businesses often are reluctant to make capital investments as 
their profit margins weaken 
runiewicz said the bulk of the survey was completed before the 
persian gulf crisis and added that higher prices and uncertainty 
after the aug 2 iraqi invasion of kuwait could cut investment 
spending even further the survey was begun in july and completed 
in midaugust 
however economists at mitsubishi bank in new york suggested in 
their current newsletter the crisis would have little effect on 
1990 investments given that most of this spending is already set 
in motion 
runiewicz said business investment contributed to the growth in 
the nations economy in 1988 and 1989 and said the slower increase 
in capital spending this year would further reduce growth 
many analysts have been looking for continued business 
investment to help keep alive an economy that has been weakening 
for more than a year as the federal reserve kept a tight rein on 
credit to curb inflation 
some economists said even before the oilprice shock associated 
with the persian gulf crisis that the economy is headed for a 
slight recession later this year 
spending on replacements for aging plants and equipment and 
expanded facilities also helps boost us productivity an 
increasingly important factor in view of the stiff competition the 
nation faces from overseas 
before adjusting for inflation the department projected a 54 
percent increase for all businesses this year to 5348 billion 
after gains of 114 percent last year and 11 percent in 1988 
it said the investment increase for all industries includes a 
47 percent gain for manufacturing companies and a 58 percent 
advance for companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing businesses 
manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of 
1924 billion 
the gain includes a 26 percent increase by industries making 
durable goods bigticket items expected to last at least three 
years and a 64 percent increase by those engaged in nondurables 
such as food and clothing

federal health officials thursday mapped a 
national strategy to improve the health of all americans by the end 
of the century putting the spotlight on preventing rather than 
curing illness 
the blueprint outlines 298 health objectives everything from 
cutting the rate of infant deaths to increasing use of seat belts 
to reducing the number of smokers 
we can no longer ignore the fact that individually and as a 
nation prevention is the single most important factor in 
maintaining good health said dr louis sullivan health and 
human services secretary 
he called for a national priority for personal responsibility 
and for choices that maintain or improve the health status of our 
citizens 
such a climate would enhance the independence of our citizens 
by preventing illness or disability and this would in turn free 
up resources for those who do encounter disease or disability he 
said 
he noted that the united states spent 600 billion on health 
care in 1989 and he said that if the same course is followed the 
bill would be 15 trillion by the turn of the century 
the 671page report identifies specific health objectives 
covering a range of areas including fitness nutrition tobacco 
alcohol drugs family planning mental health occupational and 
environmental health food safety cancer heart disease aids 
infant health and sexually transmitted diseases 
sullivan said he was especially concerned about the disparity in 
health status among americans particularly for the lowincome 
minority population 
in almost every category of mortality listed minority deaths 
are greater than that of the white population he said for 
example black infants die at twice the rate of white infants 
although he stressed the importance of personal behavior 
sullivan said the nation must find ways to make health care more 
accessible to the most vulnerable among us he made no new 
proposals 
among the goals for 2000 are 
to increase to 30 percent the proportion of people who engage 
in regular moderate physical activity for at least 30 minutes a 
day up from an estimated 22 percent in 1985 
to cut from 26 percent to 20 percent the proportion of 
overweight adults 
to reduce from 29 percent to 15 percent the proportion of adult 
smokers 
to reduce pregnancies to 50 per 1000 girls under 18 from 71 
per 1000 in 1985 
to increase use of safety restraints to 85 percent of 
automobile occupants from the current 42 percent 
to cut infant mortality to 7 deaths per 1000 births 
provisional data for 1989 show a rate of 97 per 1000 
to reduce coronary heart disease deaths to 100 per 100000 
from 135 per 100000 who died from this disease in 1987 
the objectives in healthy people 2000 were developed in a 
threeyear effort led by the public health service and involved 
more than 300 voluntary and professional organizations and state 
health departments 
the blueprint builds on a similar set of goals that were set 
more than a decade ago to be achieved by this year in assessing 
progress made by the mid1980s health officials said nearly half 
of the 226 objectives had already been or would likely be reached 
on time a final evaluation wont be made until 1992 after all the 
data for the decade is compiled officials said 
however it is already apparent that a high proportion of the 25 
percent of 1990 objectives that wont be met involve poor health of 
minority populations said dr james mason assistant secretary of 
health 
we really as a nation are going to have to target those 
medical and preventive services to those people who have not 
had access to good health care mason said

his posse fts a loosely knit crew known for graffiti and a love 
of loud dance music to police he is simply yull gary morales 19 
of queens accused murderer 
morales and seven other young men were arrested monday and 
charged with the sunday night stabbing of a utah tourist on a 
subway platform the suspects allegedly wanted cash for a night of 
drinks and dancing in manhattan instead they wound up charged 
with murder 
residents of the wellmaintained middleclass queens 
neighborhood where several members of the gang lived described the 
suspects as guys who hung out at the schoolyard drinking beer 
smoking dope and spray painting their names on the wall 
on thursday one member was spraypainting something else a 
memorial to stabbing victim brian watkins watkins 22 of provo 
tried to intervene as the gang robbed his father and punched his 
mother in the face 
the gang often meets in the flushing section coincidentally 
watkins had traveled to the same area to watch the us open tennis 
tournament 
on the night that watkins was slain several members of the gang 
met in the twostory stucco home of 18yearold ricardo lopez the 
entire group hooked up at a subway station to head into manhattan 
and the roseland ballroom with a brief stop for a mugging to 
finance the evening 
they used to come here said lopezs mom louisa rodriguez 
i used to throw them out because i knew they were up to no 
good it was not clear if she was home at that nights meeting 
morales was one of the founders of fts which some locals said 
was an obscene acronym others says it stands for flushing top 
society either way its one of about a halfdozen gangs in the 
area 
initiation into the gangs involves different rituals some fts 
members said it requires its members to mug somebody getting 
paid they call it before they join other gangs require 
aspiring members to run a gantlet of gang members who beat and kick 
him a variation is putting the youth inside a circle and letting 
him fight his way out 
fts has been around for about three years at its peak in 1988 
it had about 250 members morales had been its leader although he 
lost face two years ago for backing down in a gang fight 
associates said police say he didnt back down when watkins 
defended his mother from the attackers instead morales fatally 
stabbed the tourist police said 
morales was not the only one armed that night police said 
emiliano fernandez 18 allegedly used a box cutter to slice the 
pants pocket of watkins father and steal his wallet which 
contained 200 
fernandez whose street moniker is trauma was the only 
convicted criminal in the group authorities said 
several of the others had pending charges lopez had an upcoming 
trial for auto theft pascual carpenter 18 was arrested aug 27 
for carrying a gun on the subway ricardo nova 18 was twice 
arrested for fare beating luis fernando montero was busted once 
for the same thing anthony anderson 18 was arrested after a 
schoolyard fistfight last year 
only johnny hincapie 18 had no arrest record all eight are 
now charged with murder two counts of robbery and assault in 
watkins slaying 
on thursday fts member papo love and about two dozens other 
people were back in the schoolyard at jhs 189 love 19 had spent 
the whole night creating a spraypainted memorial to watkins 
watkins first name was in bright red orange and purple with 
his last name a blue outline with a grey interior written 
alongside the name was rest in peace and a peace symbol 
i gave that tribute to him said love i feel sorry for 
him because he lost his life for defending his mom

the us military has built a sophisticated 
network of medical facilities in the saudi desert including 15 
hospitals that officials say are equipped to treat virtually any 
type of combat wound 
the hospitals include two medical ships being deployed in the 
persian gulf along with 13 facilities spread out across the 
eastern province of the desert kingdom hundreds of doctors and 
nurses who can perform anything from neurosurgery to heart surgery 
to orthopedic surgery have been flown in to care for the estimated 
60000 us troops so far deployed in operation desert shield 
washington says the american troops are here to defend saudi 
arabia in case of an attack by iraq the scope of the medical 
system clearly shows that officials want to be prepared should war 
break out 
our hospitals are just as capable if not more capable of 
doing anything we do in the states col jerome faust commander 
of the 44th medical brigade said thursday his brigade runs the 
armys hospitals in saudi arabia 
the us navy is building a 500bed hospital in the desert 
defense department guidelines prohibit describing specific 
locations and places 
the stateoftheart facility is housed in 24 airconditioned 
caramel tents which include intensive care units an operating 
ward and a laboratory and xray unit 
we have it all were a little city said capt richard 
mayo the hospitals commander this is larger than any ground 
facility we had in vietnam 
when fully staffed the hospital will have a staff of 900 800 
of them medical personnel 
at another location the army is building a bubble hospital 
a 200bed facility with a pharmacy attached it is housed in a 
series of caterpillershaped inflatable rubber structures that 
resemble giant inner tubes a tubine engine heats and cools the 
interior 
about 15 million tons of equipment from narcotics to hospital 
beds were shipped from the united states for this hospital 
soldiers have worked mostly at night to set up the facility 
because of the searing daytime temperatures twenty doctors will 
eventually be assigned to it 
like the others the hospital will be almost exclusively for 
americans saudis may be treated occasionally at us facilities 
but the kingdom has its own modern system of medical care 
besides the hospitals each military unit such as a marine 
brigade in the desert has doctors and paramedics assigned to it 
in combat their role is to keep wounded soldiers alive until they 
can be taken to a hospital

a postal service decision to slow delivery of 
some firstclass mail in the face of a new rate increase is going 
over like a lead balloon postmaster general anthony m frank was 
told thursday 
telling americans that longer delivery times for some mail 
results in improved service is doublespeak it doesnt compute 
it doesnt jibe rep glenn english dokla said at a hearing 
by the house government operations subcommittee on government 
information 
frank said the payoff will be more consistent delivery time 
we asked the american people in surveys what good service is 
and they said it is getting it there every time so they can count 
on it frank said the postal service concluded that mail users 
want speed but want consistency more 
delaying some overnight deliveries will affect less than 5 
percent of firstclass mail he said the result will be a 
winwin situation improved mail service for our customers and 
improved efficiency for the postal service 
frank said the change in overnight deliveries was not begun as a 
costsaving measure and has nothing to do with the pending 5cent 
increase in the price of a firstclass stamp 
critics said many mail users feel they will be getting less 
service but paying more for it its going over like a lead 
balloon said rep frank horton rny 
on july 28 the postal service reduced the number of nonlocal 
overnight deliveries starting later this month about 5 percent of 
letters that now require two days for delivery will require three 
even with the changes frank said we are committed to deliver 
more than half of all the firstclass mail in this vast country 
overnight 
the changes are taking effect over objections of the consumer 
advocate for the postal rate commission stephen a gold director 
of that office told the subcommittee the postal service should 
have done a costbenefit analysis and tried to determine how much 
speed mail users were willing to forgo in the interest of 
consistent delivery times 
cary h baer vice president of the readers digest association 
inc which spends 100 million a year for us postage 
tentatively endorsed the changes because of their potential to 
significantly improve consistency of delivery while having only 
modest impact on speed

a ballot proposal to shut oregons only 
nuclear power plant appears to have strong support among voters and 
is a key issue in the governors race 
democratic gubernatorial candidate barbara roberts surprised 
observers in july when she endorsed a shutdown of the trojan plant 
near rainier but she is heartened by the results of two polls 
taken last month 
the nov 6 ballot measure to force closing the plant is 
supported by 73 percent of 600 registered voters surveyed in a poll 
for the oregonian newspaper the measure was supported by 63 
percent of those surveyed in a poll for portland station kptv 
republican gubernatorial candidate dave frohnmayer says closing 
the plant is a bad idea that could leave the state vulnerable to 
future energy shortages political tensions in the persian gulf 
make this the wrong time to consider shutting trojan says 
frohnmayer the state attorney general 
roberts has cited concerns about storage of radioactive waste 
dave has painted me as an extremist because of my position on 
the nuclear safety issue roberts said 
the results of polling on the issue may represent that dave 
frohnmayer is out of touch with oregonians roberts said

the cake was the tipoff that drug control 
chief william bennett was not going to face many tough questions 
from a key democratic senator on the first anniversary of the war 
on drugs 
its been a year and i think youve made some great 
progress senate judiciary chairman joseph r biden told bennett 
after giving him the chocolateiced cake outside the hearing room 
bennett had no problem with that assessment the two also agreed 
that much remains to be done and that congress must be pushed to 
provide the money for that war even as it faces other problems such 
as the persian gulf the deficit and the savings and loan crisis 
in fact the most severe critic of the republican 
administrations drug war was sen arlen specter a republican from 
pennsylvania 
like some house democrats specter called for dividing federal 
drug war money equally between law enforcement and treatment and 
education the breakdown is now almost 70 percent for law 
enforcement the rest for treatment and education 
president bush and bennett marked the first anniversary of the 
national drug control strategy wednesday with a white paper showing 
improvements in the drug war 
the statistics cited declines in emergency room admissions for 
cocaine and heroin surveys showing americans increasing hostility 
toward illegal drugs and increases in prices for cocaine and 
decreases in its purity indicating a reduction in supply 
the wholesale price of a kilo of cocaine now ranges from 17500 
to 35000 up from a range of 11000 to 25000 last year 
but in 1984 biden noted the wholesale price was 40000 to 
50000 
the number of cocainerelated emergency room cases declined 
slightly last year to 42145 at hospitals checked by the federal 
government biden pointed out that those same emergency rooms had 
only 10248 cocainerelated cases in 1985 
but biden ddel took pains not to blame bennett 
the fact that the problem is still extremely bad is not a 
comment on what i consider the extremely good job you have been 
doing biden told him 
bennett assured biden that the drug issues remain a top priority 
for bush who said wednesday that the issue remains no 1 for 
him despite the other crises that seem to preoccupy the white house 
these days 
were not saying the drug war is over bennett said 
were certainly not saying it will be over soon 
bennett said some communities were making more progress than 
others largely because of local efforts but he said the federal 
government should take the lead to demonstrate the importance of 
the matter to state and local governments 
the judiciary committee issued a report wednesday hailing as a 
major success an increase in spending on justice department efforts 
to combat drugs to more than 38 billion this year 15 billion 
over the 1989 level 
the report also pointed to increases in drug agents cocaine 
prices and criminal convictions 
among major failures though it listed cuts in the ranks of the 
border patrol and other agencies as well as relaxed controls on 
some military assaultstyle weapons tied to the drug trade 
the mixed review also contained praise for expanded treatment 
facilities as well as concern that the administration may have 
undercounted by as much as twothirds the number of hardcore 
cocaine addicts which it put at 24 million 
bennett and biden agreed thursday to have their staffs work out 
some common figures 
bruce carnes of bennetts office told biden he believes the 
judiciary committees number is too high because it overcounts some 
groups of the population such as those arrested and the 
governments figure is too low because it misses some groups such 
as those who are incarcerated

practice of fracking or pumping fluid and sand into a 
formation to increase the drain of oil mosbacher said giving them 
that expertise might have almost an immediate impact he said 
the soviet union the worlds largest oil producer receives 70 
percent of its hard currency from its oil improving production 
would have a dramatic impact on the soviet economy mosbacher said 
american oil companies as well stand to gain because of the 
potential joint profit ventures with the soviets he said

help bush and could open investment possibilities for his oil 
company 
in our estimation there is a tremendous amount of oil and gas 
reserves still to be found in the soviet union steward said 
he expects next weeks trip to involve preliminary discussions 
about new techniques rather than any specific proposals for new 
drilling possibilities mosbacher said the oilmen might actually 
visit soviet oil fields 
steward and other oilmen making the trip such as chesley pruet

former san diego mayor roger hedgecock 
forced from office after being convicted of hiding campaign 
contributions won a new trial today from the state supreme court 
on his 12 perjury convictions 
the court also set aside hedgecocks remaining conviction for 
conspiracy to violate campaign disclosure laws to let a san diego 
judge consider allegations that a bailiff improperly influenced 
jurors by talking about the case and getting them liquor 
in 1985 hedgecock was convicted of failing to disclose more 
than 350000 in contributions to his successful 1983 campaign for 
mayor the money allegedly came from principals in j david amp co 
an investment firm that later collapsed prosecutors said some of 
the contributions violated local election laws 
hedgecocks oneyear jail sentence and 1000 fine have been 
stayed during his appeal he now works as a san diego radio talk 
show host 
hedgecock 44 said today that he was confident the ruling is 
going to be the beginning of setting the record straight on this 
pretty unfortunate episode in my life and the life of san diego 
the former mayor had contended he was guilty of no more than bad 
bookkeeping and claimed he was the target of a vendetta by 
district attorney edwin miller 
hedgecock said a retrial would be a horrifying waste of 
resources and time millers office had no immediate comment on 
the ruling or on whether a retrial would be sought a news 
conference was scheduled for later in the day 
the court voted 52 to overturn the perjury convictions on the 
grounds that thensuperior court judge william todd told the jury 
that the alleged deliberate errors and omissions in hedgecocks 
campaign finance reports were material or substantial enough 
to support perjury charges 
the issue of whether the inaccuracies were material was a 
factual question to be decided by the jury said the supreme court 
opinion by justice joyce kennard 
the court ruled unanimously that a hearing could be held to 
consider allegations that the conspiracy conviction was also 
improper because the court bailiff purportedly made remarks that 
pressured the jurors into convicting hedgecock and supplied liquor 
for a party the night before the verdict 
todd had dismissed those allegations on the basis of written 
statements from jurors and the bailiff saying he was not 
authorized to call witnesses at a hearing

south carolina democrat ernest f hollings 
the senates biggest booster of protecting the jobs of us textile 
and apparel workers from import competition has had suits 
custommade in south korea 
at the request of us embassy officials sen richard lugar 
rind two weeks ago brought back a custommade suit from south 
korea that hollings had a seoul tailor sew from usmade fabric 
lugar was one of 32 senators who in july voted against a 
senatepassed bill by hollings that would restrict imports of 
clothing and fabrics in order to keep up the standard of living 
of us textile and apparel workers 
the house is expected to act later this month on the bill which 
was twice vetoed by former president reagan president bush has 
opposed the bill and administration officials have said they will 
urge him to veto it also 
a spokesman for lugar described his boss action as a simple 
personal favor for a colleague saying the embassy had asked 
lugar if he would deliver the suit to hollings 
hollings whose state is one of the largest manufacturers of 
textiles and clothing is not willing to talk about the suit his 
spokesman john patterson said thursday 
the washington post quoted the owner of the seoul shop as saying 
he charged hollings 100 to sew the suit together from wool fabric 
the senator had sent him the tailor also said hollings had bought 
suits in his shop during visits to south korea in 1988 and 1989

the national research council on thursday 
called for major reforms in biology education including classroom 
study of creepy crawly critters and games of what if 
biology education in america is hampered by teachers who are 
poorly trained books written to not offend adults and a curriculum 
that seems designed to snuff out interest according to a study 
released by the council an affiliate of the national academy of 
sciences 
by a variety of criteria the nation is doing a poor job in 
teaching science said timothy goldsmith a yale biology 
professor 
goldsmith one of the biologists and educators who wrote the 
study pointed to unflattering comparisons of american students 
test results with their foreign counterparts and steadily declining 
interest in science among us students 
goldsmith said biology and all other sciences should be taught 
in ways that are more interesting and personal to the children 
the entire curriculum needs to emphasize science as a 
process of understanding an openended game of what if and 
what else could that possibly mean rather than a stupefying 
exercise in memorizing terminology he said 
jane butler kahle a science professor at miami university in 
oxford ohio said science teaching should be a handson 
process where elementary children can study mice hamsters 
mealworms those creepy crawly critters and examine their 
environment 
middle school programs should emphasize human biology she said 
while high schools focus on laboratory investigative activities and 
more core concepts 
the experts said children arent spending enough time on 
science they should start learning it young preferably age 5 
they said and should spend at least an hour a day on it 
preferably in the morning when they are more open to learning 
kahle said science education now takes a mere 18 minutes a day 
in most kindergarten through third grade classes and up to 26 
minutes for children in fourth through sixth grades 
textbooks teachers and testing also could use improvement the 
report said 
textbooks are often too long abysmally crafted and written 
with the implicit aim of avoiding offense to a scientifically 
illiterate segment of the adult population it said 
the panel also said schools of education where teachers are 
taught to teach present pedagogical information so unrelated to 
the specifics of teaching science as to be of little or no help 
too many of our teachers are recruited from the lowest 
academic quartile of the college population said the study 
adding that teachers are given little opportunity to update their 
scientific knowledge or to interact with research scientists in 
industry or academia 
the study also recommended that testing be revised so it does 
not drive the curriculum 
the report was prepared by three committees that included more 
than 50 educators and scientists from many parts of the country and 
selected by the national research council

the bush administration on thursday cautiously 
endorsed the colombian governments offer to spare cocaine 
traffickers extradition to the united states if they surrender and 
confess their crimes 
if the government and people of colombia are now able to 
enforce their own laws against drug trafficking prosecuting 
convicting and incarcerating these thugs so much the better 
attorney general dick thornburgh said in a statement 
but thornburgh warned that if the socalled extraditables fail 
to take advantage of this opportunity to surrender confess their 
crimes and serve jail sentences we will continue to support 
colombias effort to arrest and extradite them to the united states 
for trial 
under the decree issued wednesday by recently inaugurated 
president cesar gaviria drug lords wanted by us authorities 
would not be extradited if they surrender and cooperate with 
colombian efforts to root out the cocaine cartels 
thornburgh and william bennett national drug policy director 
both praised the announcement 
thornburgh said the prosecution of drug traffickers in colombia 
would satisfy the bush administrations goal to seize these drug 
kingpins and bring them to justice 
there can be no substitute for the removal of these 
traffickers from society and the dismantling of the drug 
organizations they operate thornburgh said 
under the decree announced by gaviria colombian judges would be 
empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess and 
cooperate with local investigations 
gaviria also announced plans to build fortress cities where 
colombian judges will live and work free of intimidation from the 
drug lords 
bennetts chief spokesman benjamin f banta iv said the drug 
policy director thinks this is a good and positive step by the 
new colombian government to help in the war on drugs 
the offer of leniency and a promise that drug traffickers wanted 
in the united states wont be extradited provide an incentive for 
many suspects to surrender banta said 
a senior law enforcement official speaking on condition of 
anonymity called the decree a gutsy political move in a 
country where extradition is a touchy political issue 
gavirias offer appeared to be at least in part a response to 
repeated offers from the drug traffickers to surrender to colombian 
judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had 
been resumed last year by thenpresident virgilio barco 
barcos decree touched off a declaration of total war by the 
medellin cartel since then 22 colombians have been extradited to 
face federal drug charges in the united states 
twelve have either been convicted at trial or pleaded guilty 
one was acquitted an additional nine are awaiting trial 
two others were killed in shootouts with colombian authorities 
the justice department has asked for extradition of 16 suspects 
in colombian custody and the bogota government has so far agreed to 
turn over three of the accused drug traffickers said spokesman dan 
eramian

starving people broke into a warehouse 
thursday accidentally setting it ablaze and the west african 
military force sent to try to end liberias civil war said at least 
20 people were killed 
the city has been cut off from the outside world for more than 
two months because of the war and its last food stocks were 
exhausted this week doctors said some children had begun dying of 
starvation 
further details of the fire deaths were not available 
except for a few fishing boats that dared enter the city with 
their catches no new food was arriving in monrovia 
thousands of people seeking food mobbed the fivenation 
intervention force but the soldiers had little to offer and were 
waiting themselves for rations 
rebels loyal to charles taylor ended the severalday lull in 
fighting in the capital by shelling the citys small airfield 
commanders of the west african force had hoped to open the field 
to flights soon but the attack made it clear they would have to 
drive taylors rebels out of range of the strip before operations 
can resume 
gambian president sir dawda jawara urged west african states and 
the international community to send food to liberia jawara heads 
the west african regional group that sent 3000 soldiers to liberia 
in an effort to end the 8monthold tribal war which has claimed 
at least 5000 lives 
ghana gambia nigeria guinea and sierra leone have contributed 
troops to the force created by the economic community of west 
african states 
the ghanian commander of the intervention force lt gen arnold 
quainoo met jawara this week to press for emergency food aid 
jawara also met this week with burkina faso leader capt blaise 
compaore who has criticized deployment of the intervention force 
compaore has been accused of supporting taylors efforts to force 
the west african soldiers to leave liberia 
jawara said compaore promised to try to use his influence with 
taylor to accept a ceasefire 
liberias president samuel doe and taylors rival rebel 
leader prince johnson welcomed the arrival of the intervention 
force and have observed an informal ceasefire 
taylor has refused any compromise but has been unable to capture 
monrovia 
the fighting began began dec 24 when the rebels invaded from 
neighboring ivory coast accusing doe of corruption 
the war has driven more than 500000 refugees into ivory coast 
sierra leone and guinea the un high commissioner for refugees 
reported 
ivory coast sierra leone and guinea have not been able to 
provide much help to the refugees in their countries because their 
governments are deeply in debt and face serious budget problems

prime minister margaret thatcher said thursday 
that britain plans to step up its deployment to the persian gulf 
saying the united nations has already taken sufficient steps to 
allow military force against iraq 
to use no military force without the further authority of the 
security council would be to deprive ourselves of a right in 
international law mrs thatcher told an emergency session of 
parliament 
it would hand an advantage to saddam hussein and could put our 
own forces in greater peril for these reasons i am not prepared 
to limit our freedom of action she said 
mrs thatchers remarks were jeered by the opposition although 
all of britains political parties are united in supporting 
sanctions and backing participation in the usled military 
buildup in the persian gulf 
the governing conservative party and the opposition labor party 
are divided over whether legal authority already exisits to use 
force if sanctions fail to drive iraq out of kuwait 
labor leader neil kinnock argued that military action without 
new un authority would enhance iraq president saddam husseins 
stature among traditionally antiwestern arab nations 
the potential consequences of taking action that doesnt have 
complete and unarguable un authority include further turmoil 
terrorism an increase in nationalism and fundamentalism the 
destabilizing possibly of strategic allies he said 
it was the first time that parliament not due to return from 
its summer break until oct 15 has been recalled for an emergency 
sitting since the outbreak of the britishargentine war over the 
falkland islands in 1982 
saying the us military deployment in the gulf deserved strong 
support mrs thatcher noted that britain had already contributed 
three squadrons of warplanes and small numbers of ground forces to 
guard airfields 
we believe some additional forces will be needed and their 
composition is under consideration she said she gave no further 
details 
some us congressmen argue that european nations should also 
deploy large numbers of ground troops to underline joint 
involvement 
mrs thatcher says sanctions should be given months to work but 
has insisted repeatedly that the military option cannot be ruled 
out 
history has many examples of perfidy and deceit said mrs 
thatcher this ranks high among them and shows that nothing that 
saddam hussein says can be trusted iraqs actions go back to 
the laws of the jungle 
she added the person who takes such action against one 
state will take it against another if he is not stopped and his 
invasion reversed we will persevere until he is

elementary school pupils got a 
lesson in civic responsibilty and environmental ethics thursday and 
were a little more thirsty because of it 
students streaming into dora l small elementary school couldnt 
bring juice boxes for snack or lunchtime as part of maines ban on 
the popular 8ounce containers maine is the first state in the 
country to outlaw the boxes 
environmentalists contend the aseptic containers made from 
bonded layers of plastic paper and aluminum cant be recycled and 
went against the states goal of recycling half its solid waste by 
1994 
the ban took effect saturday just before the school year began 
the boxes weigh less than glass or metal theyre unbreakable and 
are easy to stash in a lunchbox or backpack 
many parents said they didnt mind the ban 
but they admitted that packing something for their children to 
drink is a little harder without being able to use the handy 
singleserving containers of juice and fruit drink that come with 
straws 
its a pain said sheri allen whose daughter amy is a first 
grader at small school i used them and ive stopped using them 
now my daughter doesnt have anything to drink at snack time 
thats what it amounts to because i cant fit two thermoses in her 
lunchbox 
kathy duca whose two children attend nursery school said she 
liked using the juice boxes and isnt sure the ban is fair 
i agree the juice box containers arent good for the 
environment she said but i dont think they can just get rid 
of one thing when there are so many other materials that pollute 
the environment like plastic containers 
several said keeping maines environment clean is worth the 
sacrifice 
if its not recyclable we shouldnt use it said wendy 
athearn as she walked to school with her son a kindergarten pupil 
weve got to do something with all this trash building up 
i agree with the ban completely added kathie barton 
another parent with her children in tow i also think milk 
cartons should be banned 
other parents like ted omeara said the ban hasnt been a 
problem my sons been bringing extra juice in a thermos 
his son ben a first grader at small shrugged his shoulders 
and wrinkled his nose when asked if he minded not being able to 
drink juice boxes anymore 
other pupils also seemed oblivious to the ban shrugging their 
shoulders or giving blank stares when asked about the new law 
sharon langella the schools secretary said she hadnt heard 
any complaints from parents

two potentially deadly kinds of viral 
encephalitis have reached high levels among viruscarrying 
mosquitoes in at least five states federal health officials said 
thursday 
only seven cases of st louis encephalitis and two cases of 
eastern equine encephalitis have been confirmed in humans in the 
united states this year the centers for disease control said but 
testing of mosquitoes this summer has detected unusually early 
and high levels of the viruses the cdc said 
cdc researchers warned that encephalitis is a potentially deadly 
illness with fatality rates as high as 30 percent symptoms 
include fever headache stiff neck and in serious cases 
nervoussystem disturbances 
the last major outbreak of st louis encephalitis the most 
common type struck nearly 3000 people 15 years ago 
in different locations the risk is going to be different 
said dr ted tsai a coloradobased encephalitis specialist with 
the cdc only certain mosquitoes carry these viruses only vector 
mosquitoes are capable of transmitting infections 
the cdc reported high levels of encephalitis viruses in 
massachusetts texas florida new york and new jersey 
indicating a potential risk for epidemic transmission 
in massachusetts which has had heavy rainfall good for 
mosquitoes for two years the risk was anticipated the cdc said 
one 7yearold boy has been diagnosed with eastern equine 
encephalitis and four more human cases are suspected 
officials ordered the spraying of 700000 acres in swampy 
southeastern massachusetts with the pesticide malathion but the 1 
million program was harshly criticized when thousands of tiny fish 
died apparently from fallout 
but if you dont do anything and theres a human case the 
public outcry is going to be you didnt do enough tsai said 
in texas tests in central houston showed as many as 25 per 
1000 mosquitoes carrying st louis encephalitis virus as many of 
60 percent of wild birds showed signs of infection 
two human cases were confirmed both patients died 
in florida high st louis encephalitis infection rates were 
noticed in flocks of chickens five human cases were confirmed and 
a sixth was suspected in three central florida counties 
in new york and new jersey tests have shown high eastern equine 
encephalitis infection rates in groups of mosquitoes 
elsewhere a fatal case of eastern equine encephalitis has been 
reported in south carolina a presumed case has been found in north 
carolina and cases in horses have been reported in georgia and 
maryland 
encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain st louis 
encephalitis about 5 percent fatal in humans and eastern equine 
encephalitis about 30 percent fatal are part of a family of 
viruses known as arboviruses 
federal health officials reported 108 cases of various arboviral

wednesday when 15yearold taleb subh returned from kuwait 
i dont know how to describe it said his father nabil 
subh im very very moved i cant believe im holding him right 
now 
taleb had been visiting relatives in kuwait city when iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
it was great kuwait city was beautiful he said but then 
i woke up and it was just changed it was like going to a different

his father said a palestinian identification card that officials 
of the palestine liberation organization gave to taleb helped get 
him through some checkpoints in iraq he left baghdad on tuesday 
along with 23 other americans who had been held hostage in iraq and 
kuwait 
taleb sounded anxious to get home when he was approached by

chicago with his parents his two brothers and his sister he was a 
little more expansive despite having gone more than 60 hours 
without sleep 
i want to get back to school and do what i was doing before 
he said i plan to kick back and relax 
another american freshly back from the persian gulf conceded 
thursday that he may have been a bit hasty when he sharply 
criticized the state department for failing to do enough to get 
americans out of kuwait and iraq

little wild because my wife tells me as far as she knows they have 
been making every effort to get us out of kuwait lloyd 
culbertson said in an interview in el paso texas 
if thats true im sorry i told the reporters what i did 
he said 
but later in the same interview culbertson said i am not 
sorry for what i said about the state department

iraq invaded the country he was among 47 americans allowed to 
leave kuwait after the rev jesse jacksons meeting with iraqi

not lifted a finger for us 
i dont agree with jesse jacksons political beliefs he 
said thursday but he got me out shouldnt i say thank you i

president bush was upgraded to first 
class thursday when a boeing 747 jumbo jet made its first official 
flight as the new air force one 
its marvelous in every way the latest in technology and 
certainly very very comfortable bush said as he stepped aboard 
the plane for a quick hop across the country for political rallies 
in topeka kan and tallahassee fla 
the president planned to be back at the white house thursday 
evening 
its so much roomier my heavens bush said it is 
magnificent 
some of the stewards chided reporters not to scuff up the new 
airplane 
be careful those cameras dont scratch the walls one said 
congress and the reagan administration decided in 1986 to spend 
a quarter billion dollars on a pair of jumbo jets to replace two 
wellpreserved but aging boeing 707s that had flown a total of 55 
million miles the delivery was almost two years late 
for a president who already has logged a record 200000 miles in 
the air in less than 20 months in office the new jet will allow 
bush to whet his appetite for travel and comfort 
the comforts range from a showerequipped presidential lavatory 
to an airborne office with a large wooden desk to a fully decked 
conference room that could accommodate more than half the cabinet 
the seats throughout the jet are firstclass size bush and his 
top staff have large leather reclining chairs 
there are televisions galore 85 telephones the latest in 
computers memory typewriters a paper shredder two galleys with 
ovens and microwaves and for the president and first lady a 
spacious private cabin with two couches that convert to twinsize 
beds theres enough freezer space on the plane to store 2000 
meals 
the white house physician could perform emergency surgery in a 
separate medical room 
the plane has a range of 7140 miles without refueling about 
1400 miles further than the old air force one and an airborne 
refueling capacity that will be used only in emergencies 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said its more 
fuelefficient and quieter than the old air force ones which 
exceeded federal aviation administration noise standards 
bush invited reporters but not camera crews or photographers 
to glimpse his private suite in the nose of the plane his private 
quarters are decorated in brown and rust tones with an upholstered 
wall mural depicting a rustic sunset 
asked if he planned any oneday trips to the persian gulf bush 
quipped stay tuned have plane will travel 
bush said he checked out the cockpit but the onetime navy 
fighter pilot said he had no plans to take the controls 
a little sitting there maybe but i wouldnt understand how to 
start this thing bush said 
col danny barr the air force one pilot since 1989 was at the 
controls of the new jet 
the presidents first landing in topeka was bumpier than the 
usual smooth setdowns for which air force one is famous but the 
plane had a smoother landing in tallahassee 
bonnie newman the presidents assistant for management and 
administration flew several trial runs on the jet including a 
trip last week to hawaii when she became the first passenger to try 
the presidential shower 
it was refreshing she said with a laugh 
while the contract called for the government to pay 266 million 
for the two jumbo jets the actual cost reportedly ran closer to 
400 million white house officials say boeing absorbed much of the 
overrun the second plane is to be delivered next year 
the new plane has separate cabins for guests bushs senior 
staff and other aides as well as for his secret service contingent 
and the press corps that travels with him 
it seats 70 passengers and 23 crew members half again as many 
as the old plane it provides room for two additional members of 
the media a total of 13 reporters photographers and television 
crews 
the passengers on the maiden flight had nine movies to choose 
from viewed on overhead televisions in each cabin with the sound 
provided by individual headsets thursdays offerings included 
the abyss indiana jones and the last crusade young 
einstein and steel magnolias 
the walls of the plane were bare but officials said photos 
would be hung 
the outside of the jet is decorated in the same colors president 
john f kennedy chose for the air force one put into service in 
1962 white and royal blue over a thin gold stripe with the bottom 
and the big cowlings for the engines in robins egg blue 
the old air force one featured a single narrow center aisle 
where vips had to weave their way past flight attendants secret 
service agents and the media on their way to the lavatories 
flight attendant becky schulz said it will be more work running 
around the longer twostory plane but will mean a lot less 
stress 
you wont be stepping over peoples feet all the time she 
said

an environmental lobby group named its 
congressional dirty dozen thursday and presented sen jesse 
helms with what it called a lifetime achievement award for 
opposing environmental legislation 
while many other lawmakers have been acquiring the knowledge 
that pollution imperils our communities and our planet helms has 
been acquiring the seniority to help thwart efforts to protect our 
air and water said ruth caplan executive director of 
environmental action 
its his cumulative record thats so bad caplan said at a 
news conference contending helms has voted consistently against 
environmental issues the lobby group supports 
helms office did not immediately return telephone calls seeking 
comment 
helms rnc was first named to the list in 1978 but wasnt 
one of 1990s dirty dozen 
the groups latest list includes three senators and nine members 
of the house the only democrat among them is sen howell heflin of 
alabama 
the other senators are minority whip alan simpson of wyoming and 
mitch mcconnell rky 
the house members are bob michel rill larry craig ridaho 
bill dannemeyer rcalif bill emerson rmo clyde holloway 
rla james inhofe rokla stan parris rva denny smith 
rore and arlan stangeland rminn 
debbie locker a spokeswoman for heflin said the rating was 
based on a limited number of votes and did not take into account 
heflins overall environmental record during his 12 years in the 
senate 
sen heflin is for doing anything to protect the environment 
as long as it does not mean people in alabama will lose their 
jobs she said 
stangeland spokesman tom hanson said environmental action was 
highlighting a few test votes and ignoring stangelands role as a 
leader in reaching compromises on environmental issues 
he looks for solutions that are environmentally safe and 
economically sound hanson said 
mcconnells reelection campaign manager steven law said the 
senators top priority was protecting jobs in kentuckys 
energydependent economy 
the problem is that kentucky relies heavily on its coal 
uranium and oil exploration industries law said in louisville 
you cannot possibly satisfy these leftwing washington groups and 
also protect kentucky jobs 
environmental action charted 12 votes in the senate and house 
that it considered this years most important on such issues as 
clean air oil spills water pollution and world population 
control each members record in key committee votes and on 
homedistrict environmental issues was also taken into account 
caplan said 
environmental action has issued a dirty dozen list in every 
congressional election year since 1970 except for 1980 and 1982 
in 1984 the list was made up of reagan administration officials 
instead of members of the house and senate 
environmental action a research education and lobby group 
says it has about 20000 members nationwide 
the national right to life committee criticized the inclusion of 
the populationcontrol vote which would have earmarked 15 million 
for the united nations population fund 
under current law us tax dollars cannot go to the fund 
because it operates programs in china which uses forced abortions 
and sterilizations to carry out its onechildperfamily policy 
it is an outrageous distortion to claim that a congressman is 
antienvironment because he opposes compulsory abortion said 
douglas johnson the committees legislative director 
caplan said the vote was included because the pressure of 
population growth on the environment can undo all the progress we 
have made

talks between officials from estonia and the 
soviet parliament were suspended thursday after the soviet side 
announced it had no authority to engage in negotiations estonian 
media reported 
the estonian side accused the soviets of unprofessional 
conduct because both sides signed a protocol three weeks ago 
agreeing to negotiations on the political and economic relations 
between the independenceminded republic and the soviet union 
according to the estonian news service 
on tuesday lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis accused 
the soviets of delaying the start of independence negotiations with 
that republic refusing to reply to its suggestions on the start of 
negotiations 
representatives of the baltic republics say the soviets may be 
stalling on negotiations because lithuania latvia and estonia have 
said they will seek full independence and wont sign a union 
treaty soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has been promoting 
the treaty to try to keep the nation of 15 republics from 
splintering 
it is clear that those were right who said that the soviets 
agreed to the talks not to reach an outcome but just for the sake 
of talks andrei birov the estonian delegations spokesman said 
in an interview with the estonian telegraph agency 
thursdays session at the kremlin between the soviet and the 
estonian parliamentary delegations was the third round of talks 
during the second round on aug 30 soviet delegation chief 
nikolai gritsenko started to use the word consultations instead 
of negotiations the estonian news service quoted ulo nugis 
the head of the estonian delegation as saying 
on thursday gritsenko said the soviet delegation was authorized 
only to hold consultations and later added we can hold 
negotiations only between independent states but estonia is only a 
soviet republic according to the soviet constitution the news 
service reported 
it was then decided that the meetings between the estonian and 
soviet delegations would be halted temporarily and only groups of 
experts from both sides will continue contacts it added 
in my mind the reason for such behavior is an understanding 
that estonia will not join the new union treaty said endel 
lippman an estonian government minister who is in charge of 
negotiations with the soviets 
the official news agency tass in its account of thursdays 
events said the delegations met as part of continuing 
consultations between the ussr supreme soviet and the estonian 
leadership and did not report the suspension of the talks 
last month estonias parliament declared that the constitution 
of the estonia soviet socialist republic was no longer effective 
and that estonia was not a part of the soviet union 
the declaration was part of a package defining the basis for 
estonias independence negotiations with kremlin representatives 
on march 30 estonia declared a transition period toward 
independence gorbachev rejected that move as well as a similar 
step by latvia and an outright declaration of independence by 
lithuania

congressional leaders of both parties said 
thursday they still want 50 billion in deficit cuts for next year 
despite the persian gulf crisis and the weak economy 
their comments came on the eve of the resumption of budget 
bargaining between congress and the bush administration white 
house officials said president bush will participate for about 90 
minutes friday when negotiators meet at andrews air force base in 
suburban maryland 
since the negotiations broke off in august for congress summer 
recess some participants for both sides have suggested working for 
a somewhat smaller deficitreduction package perhaps in the 30 
billion to 40 billion range they say such a plan would be less of 
a shock to the us economy which has shown signs of slowing 
but senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine house 
speaker thomas foley dwash and house majority leader richard 
gephardt dmo told reporters that negotiators should stick to 
the goals they were working toward when the talks recessed 50 
billion next year and 500 billion over the next five years 
gephardt said democrats also want the package to protect the 
poor and middle class encourage us energy security and prod 
economic growth 
the health of our economy and the living standards of our 
people demand no less he said 
separately house minority leader robert michel rill and 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said they also believed 
the 50 billion500 billion formula should be negotiators goal 
hopefully it is time to make the tough choices dole told 
reporters 
bush has been saying publicly for weeks that he wants to work 
toward a 50 billion package for next year 
democrats and republicans met separately on capitol hill 
thursday making lastminute preparations for their bargaining 
their aim is to work out a deal by monday 
congressional leaders and white house officials hope that with 
the negotiators secluded on the air force base chances will 
improve for a bipartisan compromise 
they also suggest that the setting and the fact that the base 
generally is closed to reporters might cut down on partisan 
posturing on both sides 
administration officials speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said bush would fly by helicopter to the air base to 
open the bargaining session on friday morning and remain for about 
90 minutes 
he will return to andrews later in the day to fly to helsinki 
for his oneday meeting on sunday with soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev 
administration officials said bush does not plan to participate 
directly in the budgetsummit talks after fridays appearance 
speaking at a republican fundraiser on thursday in topeka 
kan bush said time is running out for finding a budget 
agreement since the new fiscal year begins in just a few weeks 
ive kept the faith and yes took some heat through five 
long months of budget talks bush said 
weve got to draw the line on spending break free once and 
for all from the tired old mindset that says for every new problem 
we must create a new bureaucracy 
so i say congress get with it the time for avoiding 
tough decisions is gone the time for action is now lets fix this 
budget mess once and for all

a soviet spokesman on thursday raised the 
possibility of kremlin support for a un military force in the 
persian gulf and said mikhail s gorbachev may discuss the idea 
with president bush at their summit 
foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov did not make clear 
whether the kremlin envisioned un troops acting independently or 
replacing usled forces in the region 
the soviet union has not sent troops to join the usled 
multinational force deployed in the gulf since iraqs invasion of 
kuwait on aug 2 it previously left open the possibility of 
joining a un force but gerasimov appeared to take this a step 
further by raising the issue himself at a news conference 
we have to go back to the un charter and revive certain 
clauses of this charter in particular the clause about the 
military staff committee which may have armed forces 
international armed forces at its disposal so as to keep 
international peace and security he said 
the committee consists of senior officers from the five 
permanent members of the un security council the united states 
soviet union china britain and france it has been inactive since 
1946 but last month the united nations security council said it 
should play a role in enforcing sanctions against iraq 
gerasimov said gorbachev may raise the idea with bush at 
sundays meeting in helsinki finland garasimov however said it 
was unlikely the two nations would issue a joint ultimatum to iraq 
since the kremlin prefers multilateral action 
although iraq is a longtime ally of the soviet union gorbachev 
has condemned its invasion of kuwait and repeatedly called for 
iraqi troops to withdraw 
in talks wednesday with gorbachev and other top officials in 
moscow iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz gave no indication his 
country was willing to leave the oilrich sheikdom gerasimov said 
i see indications to the contrary because iraq is sending 
its citizens and palestinians into kuwait and giving them documents 
to live there permanently which may change the demographic balance 
in kuwait gerasimov said its a small country so they can 
change the demography and then they can hold a referendum and vote 
for kuwait joining iraq 
a senior western diplomat commenting on azizs visit said the 
soviets agreed to see him but they said rather pointedly they 
wanted to hear something new the diplomat who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said he did not see evidence that aziz 
brought anything new to moscow 
the soviet union has voted for un resolutions imposing an 
economic embargo on iraq and allowing the use of military force to 
halt ships carrying goods to or from iraqi ports 
in recent years un troops have been deployed to troubled 
areas to monitor ceasefire lines and try to keep the peace not 
since the korean war of 195053 and congo rebellion of 196064 have 
un soldiers undertaken a police action 
the korean and congo forces were directed by the full security 
council not the military staff committee 
gerasimov dismissed a proposal by iraqi president saddam hussein 
to link the withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait to israels 
pullback from its occupied territories 
it is this aggression by iraq that is on top of the agenda 
and i dont think we should link this aggression with any other 
issue otherwise the resolution of this conflict will be 
indefinitely postponed he said 
earlier thursday aziz endorsed a call for an islamic holy war 
against western forces on the arabian peninsula and accused bush of 
being a bad christian because he condemned the iraqi invasion but 
did not heed the plight of palestinians living under israeli 
occupation 
the tass news agency reported thursday that french president 
francois mitterrand telephoned gorbachev to discuss the gulf crisis 
and other mideast issues 
soviet media meanwhile have put the us military involvement 
in the gulf in a favorable light 
the evening television news program vremya in a report from 
saudi arabia showed american soldiers mingling with their saudi 
counterparts 
a soviet correspondent said the united states did not leave 
its longtime ally and oil donor saudi arabia alone to face their 
opponent the americans were the first to respond to their 
distress signal

an american trying to evade capture was shot 
and wounded by an iraqi soldier in kuwait the state department 
said thursday 
iraqi officials say the unidentified man will be discharged 
from the hospital within 24 hours but will remain in their 
custody they promise us consular access at that time said 
agency spokesman mark dillen 
dillen accusing the iraqis of outrageous behavior said the 
man was wounded in the forearm while trying to escape out of a 
window at his kuwait apartment 
the incident occurred as iraq mandated a law imposing a sentence 
of life imprisonment on people who try to leave the country without 
permission 
meanwhile an undisclosed number of american citizens are 
expected to leave kuwait and iraq on friday on what the state 
department hopes will be regular evacuation flights arranged by the 
us embassy 
in addition to american women and children whom the iraqis have 
been allowing to leave since late last month us officials said 
they hoped adult men with medical problems also would be allowed to 
depart 
asked whether the friday charter will be part of a daily exodus 
dillen said i dont want to speculate about the future beyond 
this first flight 
voa broadcasts to kuwait are encouraging americans there to stay 
in touch with the american embassy 
we are hoping to start air evacuation within the next few days 
from kuwait through baghdad to amman a text of the broadcast 
says 
there are an estimated 2200 americans in kuwait and 300 in iraq 
twelve americans were aboard a canadianchartered flight 
thursday 
dillens account of the incident involving the wounded american 
was partially provided by an american eyewitness who later was 
taken by iraqi authorities from kuwait to baghdad 
iraqi officials in baghdad confirmed the american was injured 
but said the injury was not serious dillen said 
we hold the iraqi government responsible for the health and 
welfare of all american citizens held against their will in kuwait 
and iraq dillen said 
reports that iraqi soldiers are using live fire in their 
efforts to round up foreigners are extremely disturbing and yet 
another indication of the lengths to which the iraqis are willing 
to go to carry out their inhumane policy of using innocent 
foreigners as shields while denying them the right to leave 
the state department lodged a protest with iraqi ambassador 
mohamed almashat who told reporters the american was violating 
curfew 
soldiers are under orders to enforce the curfew he said 
to enforce the law you americans use firepower in the streets 
now we are in an emergency situation

companies that say the united states should 
adopt cheaper interim technology before moving to a full 
highdefinition tv system got some bad news thursday from the head 
of the federal communications commission 
fcc chairman alfred sikes in his strongest statement yet on how 
quickly the nation should shift to hdtv told a broadcasters 
seminar that he saw little possibility the commission would decide 
to allow socalled enhanceddefinition tv to be used before full 
hdtv 
while not slamming the door completely on the interim edtv 
which is being promoted by a consortium that includes nbctv sikes 
said the commissions preliminary decision to try to adopt a 
simulcast hdtv system for the nation in early 1993 probably 
would not be changed 
i do think any objective review of the record will show that 
the simulcast hdtv option we have pointed toward has greater public 
interest than edtv sikes said in prepared remarks for a meeting 
of the association of maximum service television 
he said hdtv affords broadcasters the ability to be fully 
competitive in the future video services marketplace 
sikes is among those concerned that japanese or european 
manufacturers not dominate the hdtv market which most observers 
believe will be a huge business in the next century 
at thursdays meeting he rejected assertions that the fcc was 
moving too quickly to adopt an hdtv standard while citing japans 
long lead in bringing hdtv to the public 
nbc and the david sarnoff research center along with 
electronics giants thomson consumer electronics and philips 
consumer electronics have proposed edtv as a lessexpensive means 
of improving todays tv images 
edtv while less sharp than hdtv could be sent out by stations 
on a single channel but viewers would need a new set to receive 
the improved edtv image 
simulcast systems would send programs normally on one channel 
and the same programs in hdtv on a separate channel a new set also 
would be required to receive the hdtv signal 
the nbc consortium says edtv would require relatively 
inexpensive equipment changes at tv stations 
sikes said that adopting edtv first would create unnecessary 
costs for stations and viewers and could cause viewers to resist 
buying edtv sets if they knew that hdtv would soon make those sets 
obsolete 
the nbc consortium hedging its bets also is among a halfdozen 
companies that will offer simulcast hdtv systems for testing by an 
industrysponsored laboratory that will recommend an hdtv standard 
to the fcc testing is to begin this year or early next year 
hdtv promises crystalclear pictures and compact discquality 
sound proponents see numerous medical military and educational 
uses for sharper tv images

southshore suburbs opened thursday for the first time following an 
eightweek standoff between armed mohawks and police 
as army pipers played hundreds of cars and trucks drove onto 
the bridge from suburban chateauguay through the kahnawake mohawk 
reserve and past armored personnel carriers in the early morning 
mist 
commuters had started lining up their cars an hour earlier 
horns honking impatiently as they waited for the army to wave them 
through 
its about time one man on his way to work at a montreal 
refrigerated warehouse told a radio station the government 
should never have let this happen in the first place 
the bridge normally handles about 70000 vehicles during the 
daily rush hour it was barricaded by natives from the kahnawake 
reserve after provincial police staged an abortive attack on a 
mohawk barricade at kahnesatake near oka quebec on july 11 in 
which an officer died 
the bridge closure led to violent demonstrations by southshore 
commuters including an incident last week in which a white mob 
hurled stones at a convoy of mohawk women children and invalids 
escaping the reserve 
the stage was set for the reopening when barricades at kahnawake 
came down last week after an agreement was reached between the army 
and mohawks 
but in kahnesatake where the mohawk deadlock began over a land 
dispute soldiers spent wednesday firming up their positions 
around the last warrior stronghold 
federal indian affairs minister tom siddon met with a delegation 
of native leaders in ottawa on wednesday but he stopped short of 
committing the government to either of the two requests made by the 
indian delegation that the army retreat at least 100 yards away 
from mohawk lines and that ottawa assume an active role in the 
negotiations 
among the native leaders who met with siddon were george erasmus 
of the assembly of first nations canadas largest native group 
erasmus said the federal and quebec governments must get 
involved in a new round of negotiations to resolve the stalemate at 
kahnesatake 18 miles west of montreal 
about 400 soldiers have backed some 20 warriors and 30 mohawk 
women and children into a piece of land about the size of two 
football fields bordered by a highway and a lake on wednesday the 
soldiers surrounded the site with razor wire and set up a floating 
barricade on the lake 
the mohawks say they wont lay down their arms until a policing 
arrangement is worked out that would preclude the quebec provincial 
police from taking control once the crisis comes to an end natives 
say they fear reprisals from the police for the death of one of 
their officers in the botched raid in july 
the deadlock at oka began when provincial police stormed a 
barricade the mohawks erected to stop the towns plans to expand 
the local golf course saying the property in question was part of 
their ancestral land 
elsewhere in quebec about 100 micmac indians blocked a stretch 
of highway just across the border from cambellton new brunswick 
the indians felled trees and used rocks and abandoned cars to 
set up two roadblocks they said the barricades would remain until 
the oka crisis is resolved

the gannett foundation purchased 2000 copies 
of the autobiography of its chairman allen h neuharth raising 
questions about whether it was trying to boost the books standing 
on national bestseller lists the washington post said thursday 
neuharth in response was quoted as saying he was on the posts 
enemy list 
neuharth said that post executive editor ben bradlee was out to 
get him and that playing a nonnews story like this on page 
one when the world is full of real news is typical of the personal 
journalism the post uses to try to get its enemies and help its 
friends 
he was quoted in a statement by foundation president and chief 
executive officer charles l overby 
the foundation said that it spent 40000 to buy the copies of 
confessions of an sob that the books were donated to 
college libraries and journalism schools and that there was no 
attempt to manipulate sales 
overby said in his statement that purchase of the books was 
consistent with our mission of teaching young journalists and other 
young people how to succeed in life 
neuharth was chairman of gannett co the nations largest 
newspaper group until he retired 17 months ago to head the 
foundation he told the post his autobiography sold 164000 copies 
in hardback between september 1989 and the end of last year it was 
on the new york times bestseller list for several weeks 
the post quoting gannett editors and people connected to the 
foundation said the foundations motives were suspect because it 
bought the books at full retail prices in stores around the country 
the foundation could have obtained the books at a sizable 
discount from neuharths publisher doubleday inc but only retail 
purchases count on bestseller lists compiled by the new york times 
and publishers weekly 
the post said overby asked some of gannett cos 81 daily 
newspapers to buy books at stores in their cities the foundation 
then reimbursed the editors for the cost of the books 
michael kagay editor of news surveys for the new york times 
book review said the purchase of 2000 copies normally would not 
have much effect on how a book fares on the bestseller list 
the times does not reveal the names of the approximately 3000 
bookstores it surveys in compiling its list and if someone tried 
to influence the list most of their purchases would be wasted 
they wouldnt know which stores to go to kagay said 
overby in his statement said neuharth now traveling outside 
washington laughed heartily when i read him the post story

a high school teacher felt the persian gulf 
crisis down to the soles of his feet thursday when he dramatized 
energy conservation by walking 11 miles to his classroom 
scores of students joined don chenoweth voting with their feet 
in favor of reducing us dependence on foreign oil supplies 
the prices are going up says coleman davis a 14yearold 
freshman at concord high school who walked several miles so if 
lots of people from our school walked wed save gas 
the idea grew from chenoweths senior government class where 
students began discussing methods of energy conservation in the 
face of rising fuel prices 
in the course of the conversation i threw out the challenge 
if i walk to school one of these days how many students would be 
willing to do the same he said while walking the final yards 
if nothing else theyll get a little firsthand involvement 
with current events 
chenoweth left his mishawaka home at 345 am walking with 
school counselor don mann and arrived shortly after 7 am nearly 
30 minutes ahead of schedule 
chenoweth 57 doesnt offer himself as model of fitness or 
restraint in driving he says his exercising is usually limited to 
an occasional evening stroll and hes put 146000 miles on his 
1982 pontiac 
many people have forgotten the conservation lessons enforced by 
oil crises of the 1970s he said and for his students those years 
are dim history 
i did tell them about the 1970s how we were mandated by the 
government to turn back the heat in public buildings and 
encouraged to do other things he said 
they were not aware that the 55 mileperhour speed limit 
really came about in an attempt to save fuel not an attempt to 
slow us down to save lives 
about 300 students agreed to give up cars and school buses for 
the day and walk said principal robert sutton who walked the two 
miles from his home 
no one kept count of how many participated but scores of 
students appeared on foot in groups of three and four already 
looking tired and sweaty shortly after 7 am 
four miles we did it said lee anne grice we are having 
an energy crisis right now so i thought it would be a good way to 
show my support 
sophomore chris carrel 15 left his motor scooter which gets 
about 75 miles to the gallon at home to prove his point 
the iraq thing kind of makes it worthwhile he said saves 
me some gasoline 
chenoweth and mann arrived sweaty but smiling then showered and 
changed for class 
i may move closer if we try this again said mann

after being held a political hostage by a mutinous 
lieutenant governor gov michael s dukakis departed on a european 
trade mission thursday as his allies moved to quash the rebellion 
dukakis had delayed his travel plans tuesday after lt gov 
evelyn murphy threatened to seize control of massachusetts feeble 
finances once he left 
i think the episode of the past 24 hours is really kind of 
pathetic dukakis said at a brief airport news conference before 
boarding his plane to germany 
while dukakis allies moved to quash the rebellion thursday with 
references to a new form of murphys law and an attempted 
bloodless coup murphy said her boss was acting weird by not 
letting her assert herself 
theres no good will here and certainly no mutual respect 
murphy said 
dukakis said he did not speak to murphy on thursday but he said 
he believed her assurances that she would act responsibily in his 
absence but he said he could cut his trip short if anything occurs 
that affected the governments stability 
murphy spokeswoman jody durso said the lieutenant governor who 
is seeking the democratic nomination for governor would not take 
any action thursday night durso did not rule out murphy acting 
later 
murphy who is lagging in her democratic primary race to succeed 
dukakis had been a strong supporter of the governor in his 1988 
bid for the presidency but with the state in a fiscal disaster and 
dukakis not seeking reelection politicians have treated him as a 
liability 
murphy took the antidukakis revolt to a new level wednesday 
when she disclosed she was waiting for the governor to leave the 
state so as acting governor she could push a secret plan for 
solving the states financial woes 
dukakis decided to postpone his travel plans prompting some 
observers to say he was being held hostage by his own lieutenant 
governor 
dukakis bitterly denounced the tactic as a maneuver designed to 
gain favor with voters in the gubernatorial race on thursday 
aides to dukakis echoed that charge 
heres a lady who isnt going to get elected governor no 
matter what she does and she is dangerously flirting with the 
economic health of the commonwealth of massachusetts thats 
irresponsible said l edward lashman state secretary of 
administration and finance lashman said he isnt publicly 
supporting any candidate in the sept 18 primary 
according to recent public opinion polls murphy is well behind 
her two democratic opponents former state attorney general 
francis x bellotti and john silber who is on leave as boston 
universitys president before this week she tried gently to 
disassociate herself from dukakis claiming she warned him in the 
spring of 1988 that the state was headed for trouble 
murphy insisted thursday that she was simply looking out for the 
wellbeing of the state which discovered this week its tax 
collections had fallen short for the second month in a row that 
prompted dukakis to order cabinet members to find 150 million 
worth of cuts 
murphy said quicker action was needed but she refused to reveal 
her strategy even to dukakis during a phone conversation 
shes elevated murphys law to an art form said stephen 
crawford a dukakis spokesman whatever can go wrong shell make 
sure goes wrong 
in her defense murphy told a radio station thursday i cant 
understand why hes so concerned and what this strange behavior is 
about frankly i find the governors response yesterday 
weird 
murphys actions however caused some defections within her 
ranks william currier a campaign coordinator resigned because of 
her moves against dukakis 
its almost an attempted bloodless coup he said if murphy 
tries to make changes as acting governor he said cabinet 
secretaries might either disregard her or dukakis could reverse 
the action once he returned 
currier also questioned how murphy could solve problems in 10 
days that hundreds of people couldnt solve in two years 
the states fiscal mess has given massachusetts the lowest bond 
ratings of any state 
lashman said thursday that wall street had started to send 
positive signals since the state adopted a tax and budget package 
and dukakis ordered new cuts once it became apparent they were 
necessary he said murphys actions could undo efforts to rebuild 
the states image

officials will go for about 350 nightly

background of tomesku or how he obtained the property except to 
say he is leasing it 
brezhnev ruled the soviet union from 1964 until his death in 
november 1982 
under mikhail s gorbachev brezhnev has been blamed for 
fostering complacency and cronyism during his years in power which 
soviet officials call the period of stagnation 
the press has published other details of his lavish lifestyle 
including a white marble mansion in azerbaijan built for brezhnev 
so he could stay there during a 1982 visit he stayed there two 
days

lawmakers criticized a treaty laying the 
foundation for german unity thursday because it fails to give east 
germans control over the secret files of the former communist 
regime 
the treaty that reconciles many of the differences between the 
two german states came up for a first reading in parliament 
several legislators were irate over the vagueness of the 
provision dealing with the files kept by the former secret police 
a group of activists who helped lead the revolution that toppled 
the communists have been occupying the former state police 
headquarters where the files are kept 
they began a sitdown protest on tuesday and are demanding that 
east germans have access to the files and that secret police still 
working in the government be fired 
even prime minister lothar de maiziere said the provision in the 
treaty which he personally approved should be modified to deal 
more specifically with the fate of the files 
later his top unity negotiator guenter krause said on west 
german radio that east germans should be allowed to know what is in 
their files 
the files are an emotional issue in a nation that was largely 
kept in check by the smothering and frequently sinister activities 
of the giant secret police network 
the activists and many lawmakers are demanding that east germans 
have the right to read the files that were kept on them records 
were kept on an estimated 6 million of the 16 million germans 
the treaty between the german states says the files will 
temporarily remain on east german land but will be administered by 
a west german official until a united german parliament to be 
elected on dec 2 makes a final decision on their future 
however activists and many lawmakers said the agreement was 
tantamount to giving the files to west germany because the united 
parliament will be dominated by lawmakers from the larger country 
some lawmakers demanded the rejection of the 900page state 
treaty that aims to reconcile many of the social and political 
differences between the two nations which are to merge on oct 3 
lawmakers are expected to hold a final vote on the treaty next 
week

an editor at the washington afroamerican 
resigned thursday after saying the minorityowned weekly newspaper 
refused to profile a mayoral candidate because he is white 
robyn denise yourse who is black said thursday she submitted 
her resignation to publisher frances murphy after murphy refused to 
include a story on city council chairman david clarke in a 36page 
issue of the paper 
i felt that the reasons given for yanking the profile were 
racially biased said yourse it was a decision in all good 
conscience i could not agree with 
yourse declined to elaborate on her discussion with the 
publisher who also is black 
her reasoning was clear to me and i will say it had nothing 
to do with the candidates views yourse said beyond that i 
do not wish to embellish 
murphy denied that clarke was excluded because of his race 
claiming that other candidates who did not receive the papers 
endorsement were not given fulllength feature articles 
were just a weekly and we dont have the space murphy 
said there were lots of people who didnt get articles so you 
cant say it is black and white 
she added that she was uncertain whether the paper had prepared 
an article on the council chairman 
there are some we did and some we did not do murphy said 
i just dont know 
but an afroamerican staffer who asked not to be identified by 
name said clarke had been the subject of a feature story 
they had it ready the staffer told the associated press 
he came up there he was interviewed and a story was prepared 
clarke is the only white vying for the citys democratic mayoral 
nomination his four opponents are black 
clarke a washington native and veteran of the civil rights 
movement has been ranked third or fourth in recent public opinion 
polls 
the afro which endorsed ray for mayor in thursdays edition 
has long been a source of news and influence in washingtons black 
community the newspaper lists its circulation at 10000 which 
would make it the most widelyread of six minoritypublished

as hundreds of foreigners trapped in iraq 
and kuwait struggled to get out iraq on thursday imposed a law 
mandating possible life imprisonment for those caught trying to 
leave without permission 
a plane with 136 canadians 12 americans and 10 irish who had 
been in kuwait and iraq arrived in london late thursday on a 
nationair flight chartered by canadas government airport 
authorities reported all but 24 of the passengers were flying on 
to toronto after a brief refueling stop they said 
a british airways charter with 250 women and children on board 
departed early friday from amman for london they arrived thursday 
in jordan on two iraqi airways jets one carrying 150 passengers 
and the second 100 said british ambassador to jordan anthony reed 
iraqs justice minister akram abdulkader ordered public 
prosecutors and police to revive a 1987 law that a foreigner 
violating the entry and exit procedures will be sentenced to 
life or temporary imprisonment and all cash in his possession will 
be confiscated 
in an interview with the official iraqi news agency monitored 
in nicosia he said courts and prosecutors are called upon to 
make no exception in implementing this law in light of the present 
circumstances 
the minister added that foreigners must report any change in 
address within 48 hours or face prison terms of one to three years 
plus fines of 300 to 1500 
hundreds of westerners in iraqioccupied kuwait are in hiding to 
avoid being captured by iraqi troops some foreigners keep 
constantly on the move often avoiding iraqi soldiers with the help 
of kuwaiti friends 
abdulkader repeated an order given aug 24 that anyone caught 
harboring a foreigner would face charges of espionage punishable 
by death 
earlier a british convoy carrying 182 women and children 
arrived in the iraqi capital from kuwait the iraqi president 
saddam hussein has said women and children may leave but men must 
stay 
the latest arrivals were put in a hotel where presumably they 
will await official permission to leave the country some men were 
believed to be among the group 
the convoy left kuwait on thursday at 915 am for the 14hour 
drive across the desert to baghdad british diplomats in iraq said 
the diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said about 60 
women and children were in the group including 50 britons nine 
americans and one west german us embassy officials were trying 
to arrange travel for the group to the jordanian capital of amman 
aboard an iraqi airways flight 
another 306 foreigners arrived in baghdad on tuesday in a convoy 
from kuwait 
four irish women and children made it to amman on thursday on an 
iraqi airways flight from baghdad 
an air france jet landed in paris about dawn thursday carrying 
153 westerners including three pregnant women who had traveled 
from baghdad overnight there were at least nine americans on board 
a western source in baghdad said the united states was trying to 
persuade iraq to allow an iraqi airways jet to airlift some 
americans directly out of kuwait without the overland trip to 
baghdad an estimated 1300 americans remain in kuwait which has 
been occupied by iraqi soldiers since aug 2 
there are believed to be a total of 11000 westerners trapped in 
iraq and kuwait 
joanna restall of brighton england is one of the westerners 
who have managed to get out of the region in relatively small 
batches the past week she arrived in london early thursday from 
baghdad ms restall was part of a convoy saturday that made a 
hairraising drive across the desert from kuwait city 
ms restall 29 who had been teaching english in kuwait said 
the people left behind in kuwait are frightened particularly the 
men 
they cant go out the shops are closed there are lots of 
wrecked cars everywhere its like a ghost town she said 
the iraqis have moved some westerners to strategic facilities 
such as military bases to deter possible attacks by western forces

the bush administration will enter 
negotiations with the european space agency to set guidelines for 
multinational commercial space ventures the white house said 
thursday 
the guidelines would cover undertakings with countries without 
market economies like the soviet union and china 
the negotiations are intended to develop principles of free 
and fair trade the white house said so that us 
spacelaunching firms can compete in an international market free 
of what they contend is unfair foreign government support 
the white house said bush has approved a new national space 
policy directive designed to encourage the growth of us private 
sector space activities and calling for the talks 
the new policy was influenced by the end of cold war tensions 
with the soviet union and the administrations view that some 
restrictions formerly imposed under national security guidelines 
can be eased said an administration official 
another source close to bushs national space council which 
developed the policy said the easing of restrictions is another 
sign the cold war is over 
the sources spoke on condition that their names not be used 
the new policy requires that national security restrictions on 
technology transfers still must be taken into account with any 
commercial launching venture with foreign countries 
the guidelines are meant to replace the ad hoc approval 
practices that governed past decisions on space launch firms such 
as bushs recent authorization for a us firm to participate in a 
launching project in cape york australia 
that firm usbi co of hunstville ala eventually hopes to 
launch americanmade satellites on soviet rockets from the cape 
york 
usbi would provide program management engineering and 
development for the launching facility and the soviet union would 
provide the boosters the united states government is not involved 
in the project 
the new policys major contribution to such future ventures is 
predictability said courtney stadd senior director of commercial 
space for the national space council which is headed with vice 
president dan quayle 
were trying to work out the principles of free market play 
he said comparing it to the early days of aviation when there were 
no rules governing international flights 
it requires that us government satellites be launched only on 
usmanufactured rockets 
it also opens the possibility of government incentives to 
encourage technical improvements to reduce the cost and increase 
the reliability of us space launch vehicles according to a 
white house fact sheet 
the administration will begin negotiations with the european 
space agency sometime later this month on an agreement that 
defines principles of free and fair trade it said 
us rocket launching firms have complained that european space 
firms have unfair advantages due to government asistance

nasa said thursday it will replace 
the fuel pump that likely caused its latest failure to get 
astronauts back in space and try again in midseptember to launch 
columbia 
nasa administrator richard truly said a new pump will be 
installed this weekend if that seems to correct the problem a 
fourth launch attempt will be made to launch the shuttle with an 
astronomical observatory early the week of sept 17 
its not a 100 percent guarantee but its the one shot we 
have to get the astro mission airborne before discoverys 
scheduled flight with the ulysses satellite in october truly said 
the unit is bolted in and can be replaced easily said launch 
director bob sieck crews cannot enter the compartment until friday 
because propellants remain aboard preventing a new pump from being 
installed until saturday 
on wednesday nasa called off its third attempt to send columbia 
on a mission to study some of the hottest objects in the universe 
with the 150 million astro observatory thursdays early morning 
launch was scrubbed after hydrogen flooded into the rear 
compartment 
officials continued filling columbias massive external tank to 
pinpoint the source and narrowed their search to the shuttles 
three recirculation pumps 
each of the shuttles three main engines has a pump officials 
were uncertain which one might be leaking or whether there were 
other holes 
the pumps are part of the plumbing in the rear of the shuttle 
where pipes range in diameter up to 17 inches they are directly in 
front of the huge engines and are accessible through side doors 
were not talking about a large leak were talking about an 
extremely small leak said forrest s mccartney director of 
kennedy space center its very elusive and very frustrating 
it is a real booger to try to find and isolate shuttle boss 
robert crippen said 
if a new pump does not correct columbias leaks or the launch is 
delayed too long the mission will wait until after discoverys 
flight with ulysses a satellite being sent on a fiveyear journey 
to explore the suns polar regions discovery must lift off between 
oct 5 to oct 23 to take advantage of the proper planet alignment 
ulysses is our first priority and we will not compromise 
that said william lenoir head of nasas space flight program 
columbias seven astronauts left for their training base in 
houston at dawn 
the mood at the space center was one of disappointment mixed 
with relief 
my first reaction was frustration said program scientist ed 
weiler but my next thought was my god im glad they stopped 
some of my friends are aboard hydrogen is highly combustible 
nasa had to replace a pump once before on atlantis last year 
it delayed the launch with the magellan space probe for six days 
in may nasas first attempt to launch columbia for the astro 
mission ground to a halt at almost the same moment during fueling 
as more than a halfmillion gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid 
oxygen were flowing into the tank wednesday the earlier attempt 
too was delayed by leaks in two places 
the space agency returned columbia to the hangar replaced a bad 
valve and plugged leaks the lines were tested with helium at room 
temperature rather than with liquid hydrogen a highly combustible 
fuel that contracts metal because of its extreme cold 
the repairs gave nasa the confidence to proceed with another 
launch attempt said david winterhalter director of systems 
engineering and analysis for the national aeronautics and space 
administration the second try last week was called off because 
of communications problems with one of astros four telescopes 
columbias long flight with astro and its astronauts four of 
them astronomers was to have revitalized nasas stalled shuttle 
program the last shuttle flight was in april when discovery 
carried the defective hubble space telescope into orbit 
a month after first discovering columbia was leaking the 
shuttle atlantis was found to have a similar problem and the entire 
fleet was grounded 
john logsdon director of the space policy institute at george 
washington university said he is confident nasa will fix the leak 
and that shuttles soon will be flying again 
weve launched 35 of these things its not like the system 
cant work we know it can work logsdon said this is the kind 
of vexing problem that will pop up along the way

hardline communists from across the soviet union 
headed back home thursday after spending three days lamenting 
president mikhail s gorbachevs reforms and arguing that socialism 
has a bright future 
traditionalists far outnumbered reformers among the 2585 
delegates to the communist party congress of the russian republic 
the largest of the soviet unions 15 republics 
they applauded fiercely thursday when a littleknown leningrad 
delegate mikhail popov said gorbachevs perestroika reform 
program was not a revolution but a counterrevolution they 
clapped even louder when popov warned that efforts to create a 
marketbased economy would help black marketeers 
gorbachev sat silently on the podium during popovs speech and 
most of the threeday session in the kremlins cavernous marble 
palace of congresses he finally addressed the congress thursday 
afternoon just before it ended but his speech was closed to both 
soviet and foreign reporters 
reformers who dared to speak in the open sessions were jeered 
and heard deliberately disruptive applause which the official 
soviet press agency tass described as badtempered clashes 
one young delegate vladimir c zaitsev of murmansk incurred 
the wrath of the hardliners by suggesting their leader russian 
communist party first secretary ivan k polozkov did not have the 
confidence of the people 
zaitsevs 10minute speech was interrupted so many times he grew 
redfaced and was barely able to continue 
on tuesday a traditionalist from the siberian city of tyumen 
ivan vtorushin suggested the country would be better off if it 
returned to the way things were in 1985 the year gorbachev came to 
power 
the purpose of the congress was primarily organizational to 
complete the creation of a separate russian branch of the communist 
party until this year russian communists were simply members of 
the soviet party and did not have their own organization 
the russian party was founded at a first congress in the kremlin 
in june when polozkov was elected its leader that congress was 
widely seen in the soviet union as an attempt by traditionalists to 
reassert themselves after being eclipsed for several years 
since june several reformers have quit the russian party 
others such as economist pavel bunich have publicly condemned the 
russian party as rightist and called for polozkov to resign 
polozkov 55 has accused the proreform soviet media of 
conducting a campaign against him and discrediting traditional 
socialist values he said thursday he would not step down 
despite their high profile during the congress the influence of 
the hardliners appears limited they do not have the authority to 
make laws and the party has lost both its official leading role in 
society and much of its unofficial grip on soviet life

hungarian president arpad goencz 
planted a tree thursday to mark the opening of an international 
environmental center to help eastern europe cope with its 
widespread pollution problems 
proposed by president bush when he visited hungary in july the 
regional environmental center is an independent organization for 
training and information on energy efficency public health and 
regional cooperation on pressing environmental problems 
it is designed to provide data on environmental issues but not 
to get involved in political decisions in eastern european 
countries said lee pasarew director of its project development 
team peter hardi is the executive director 
the opening of this center today is only the latest in a 
remarkable series of events that history will record as the 
revolution of 1989 william k reilly administrator of the 
environmental protection agency said in an opening speech 
eastern european countries are struggling with the results of a 
chronic disregard for the environment that characterized the 
communist regimes overthrown last year 
antiquated factories central to their economies still spew tons 
of waste into the air and water many forests are damaged if not 
decimated by acid rain 
reilly said wednesday that the center was a way of providing 
legitimacy involvement for eastern european environmentalists 
who had been previously suppressed 
half of the 10 million needed to start the center was donated 
by the united states the european community gave 25 million 
hungary 800000 and the netherlands austria and canada 15 
million total finland and norway made smaller contributions 
any country may join the center by contributing money but only 
eastern european countries may join free of charge

a union at nbc said 10 of its members were laid 
off because of a new contract nbc put into effect last month so 
now it plans a boycott against nbc and sponsors of the networks 
shows 
nbc denied the accusations of the national association of 
broadcast employees and technicians and characterized the 
threatened boycott as an effort to harass the network 
the skirmish was the latest since nbcs aug 15 implementation 
of a new fouryear contract that the unions members rejected 
twice they struck nbc in 1987 in a bitter walkout lasting 17 weeks 
no strike is imminent this time because the union says it has 
decided to employ what it calls the inside game keep its 
members on the job as its lawyers fight nbcs action in various 
ways 
the 10 union members being laid off work at nbcowned wmaqtv in 
chicago include mike cunningham a member of the unions 
negotiating committee and secretary of the unions local there 
nabet spokesman john krieger said 
kreiger whose union says it represents more than 2300 people 
in nbcs 5800member work force attributed the layoffs to nbcs 
new contract 
nbc spokesman joe rutledge said the 10 layoffs had been planned 
for late last year and early this year but were delayed to 
assist with vacation relief needs during the summer 
the layoffs have absolutely nothing to do with the new 
contract he said asked if more layoffs are planned he replied 
not to my knowledge 
krieger made public an aug 28 letter from nabet to lane 
kirkland president of the aflcio the letter said a boycott 
against nbc is part of the unions strategy to fight the contract 
that the network put into effect 
in addition to nbc the boycott will be against the companys 
owner general electric and sponsors who advertise on nbcowned 
television stations and nbcs more than 200 affiliated stations 
krieger said 
no date has been set but the boycott will happen very 
shortly he said 
rutledge responded that a boycott would certainly qualify as 
harassment its regrettable a boycott serves no ones 
interest and will gain nabet members absolutely nothing 
until the union ratifies the contract that nbc has put into 
effect he added members wont be eligible for the pay raises it 
provides

jersey area port everglades fla north of miami lake charles 
la near the texas border port hueneme calif north of los 
angeles and seattle wash 
the worst spill in us history occurred in alaska on march 24 
1989 but costello told a news conference the vastly improved spill 
response capability in alaska is now greater than it will be at any 
of the corporations regional centers however he said marine 
spill response is negotiating to work out what role it might play 
in alaska 
the corporation is funded by dues from companies in the oil 
industry including owners shippers and purchasers of crude oil 
and petroleum products who have formed the marine preservation 
association each pays according to the number of barrels handled 
but if a company spills oil it will have to pay for the 
cleanup even if it is a duespaying member of the association 
costello said 
in addition to the regional centers marine spill response will 
have vessels at about nine other sites ready for any spill along 
coastal areas of the atlantic pacific or gulf of mexico or around 
hawaii the virgin islands or puerto rico said costello a retired 
coast guard vice admiral 
were excited by the prospect of creating the worlds largest 
bestequipped and besttrained oil spill cleanup organization he 
said 
each regional center will have the ability to handle a spill 
roughly as large as the record 11milliongallon spill of crude oil 
from the exxon valdez in alaskas prince william sound he said 
regional centers can combine forces to handle even larger spills 
the corporation expects to spend 315 million on initial 
equipment including ships trucks booms skimmers dispersants 
and tools for dealing with wildlife and damaged shorelines 
the company with about 400 employees will administer spill 
response but will contract most of the work out to scores of other 
companies costello said 
he said it would supplement existing private and government 
cleanup operations 
we dont want to replace anybody whos there absolutely not 
theyre doing a fine job he said 
the company was set up to fulfill the terms of federal oil spill 
legislation signed by president bush last month the bill gives oil 
companies until february 1993 to show they can contain and clean up 
a worstcase oil spill 
costello said the new company would be fully operational by then 
and could provide some limited response even earlier 
the oil spill law also increased the liability of shippers from 
a ceiling of 150 per gross ton of the tanker to 1200 per gross 
ton 
costello said liability laws in some states should be changed to 
allow for a quick response to oil spills he said that although his 
company would have no problem because it is a nonprofit 
corporation its subcontractors might be inhibited 
the company grew out of an american petroleum institute task 
force on oil spills which determined in june 1989 that neither the 
government nor the oil industry had the equipment or personnel 
ready to deal with a catastrophic spill 
the new corporation will have its headquarters in washington 
but will be independent from the petroleum institute with a board 
of directors made up of people outside the industry

the federal government intends to test a 
new weapong in the fight against crime denying student loans 
federally backed mortgages and other federal benefits to convicted 
drug users in rhode island 
gov edward d deprete hailed the plan thursday as a sensible 
approach to the drug problem but civil libertarians complained 
that it would be unfair the head of a national prosecutors group 
said violators would be losing only yuppietype benefits 
diprete announced that rhode island had been awarded a 150000 
justice department grant to set up a system for tracking drug 
convicts 
a neverused twoyearold federal law allows state and federal 
judges to bar drug convicts from receiving federal contracts and 
benefits that include farm subsidies and pilots licenses 
its breaking new ground diprete said at a statehouse news 
conference we feel the federal law makes sense its one tool in 
the arsenal and its worth a try 
but the american civil liberties union which fought the 
proposal when it was debated in congress denounced it as 
unnecessarily punitive 
i cant see any beneficial purpose being served by denying 
individuals certain benefits simply because of the nature of the 
offense that happens to be the big political issue of the time 
said steven brown executive director of the aclus rhode island 
affiliate 
lawenforcement officials said they knew of no cases where the 
law had been used since it was passed in november 1988 
people convicted for a first offense of felony drug trafficking 
could be ineligible for federal programs for five years benefits 
would be denied for 10 years on a second offense and for life on a 
subsequent conviction 
felony drug possession convictions could make someone ineligible 
for one year on a first offense and five years on subsequent 
convictions 
the aclu tried to have programs such as student loans and grants 
exempted said janlori goldman the aclus legislative counsel in 
washington 
many student loans and grants are needsbased she said 
but the law specifically exempts only retirement social 
security health disability veterans or public housing benefits 
richard wintory director of the national drug prosecution 
center in virginia said the law still punishes people who might 
not get prison but exempts those who would be harmed by losing 
federal benefits 
the benefits that were talking about are yuppietype 
benefits they are middleclass benefits they are government 
freebies wintory said those are the people now that in the 
criminal justice system get off the lightest these are the 
stockbrokers lawyers wealthy white kids 
the law also bars judges from denying benefits if someone was 
addicted to drugs but had no treatment available or who had 
undergone treatment and overcome a drug dependency 
its a pretty milquetoast provision as it is wintory said

a former union boss whose gun was used to kill 
two antimarcos activists nine years ago was charged with 
aggravated firstdegree murder in the slayings prosecutors said 
thursday 
constantine tony baruso was president of the alaska cannery 
workers union when gene viernes and silme domingo were gunned down 
in the union offices on june 1 1981 
baruso 62 was arrested at his home in tacoma late wednesday on 
a warrant charging him with two murder counts said king county 
prosecutor norm maleng baruso was being held thursday in the king 
county jail on 500000 bail an arraignment hearing was scheduled 
friday 
barusos attorney anthony savage said his client would plead 
innocent the charges arose out of new information that came to 
light during a recent civil lawsuit filed by the victims 
relatives maleng said 
criminal charges initially were not filed against baruso because 
of insufficient evidence he said 
ive always said that this was an open case and that we would 
be willing to look at any new evidence which might cast light on 
barusos involvement with these murders maleng said 
authorities identified barusos handgun as the murder weapon but 
said baruso told them the weapon was stolen from him baruso was 
later convicted of embezzling money from the union 
prosecutors would attempt to establish that barusos involvement 
in the killings stemmed both from his interest in controlling the 
union and in halting viernes and domingos work to end 
gangdominated gambling in alaska fish canneries maleng said 
maleng also said prosecutors would try to show that baruso 
conspired with thenphilippine president ferdinand marcos and dr 
leonilo malabed of san francisco a marcos friend to kill the two 
activists 
savage said thursday he was surprised to hear of his clients 
arrest 
im disappointed savage said well do our best to fight 
it 
three men members of a filipino gang called tulisan were found 
guilty of murder at the original criminal trial prosecutors in 
that case argued the killings stemmed from an internal union 
dispute in which domingo and viernes worked to end the gambling in 
alaska fish canneries 
but in the civil lawsuit family members contended the slayings 
were ordered from manila because of domingos and viernes activism 
against marcos regime 
a us district court jury last december awarded the families 
151 million from the estate of marcos who died in hawaii after 
he was ousted in a coup and from his widow imelda us district 
judge barbara rothstein later found baruso and malabed liable for 
an additional 84 million 
family members expressed joy thursday at malengs decision to 
file murder charges 
i knew that whether it took 10 to 20 years someday he 
baruso would pay for these murders said cindy domingo 
domingos sister 
joining her at a press conference was domingos widow terri 
mast and their attorney michael withey 
were convinced that the evidence against baruso is 
overwhelming withey said 
aggravated firstdegree murder is the only crime in washington 
that carries the possibility of the death penalty if prosecutors 
decide not to seek death the only alternative upon conviction 
would be life in prison without parole

iraq tightened the screws on trapped westerners on thursday 
warning that anyone trying to leave without permission could face 
life in prison the soviet union raised the possibility of kremlin 
support for sending a un military force to the persian gulf 
saudi arabia committed several billion dollars toward defraying 
the enormous cost of the us forces protecting the kingdoms oil 
fields from possible iraqi aggression us and saudi officials 
announced 
us officials said the saudis would at a minimum pick up all 
fuel water and transportation costs for the 60000 american troops 
now in saudi arabia earlier this week secretary of state james 
baker iii told congress the us presence would cost about 6 
billion by years end 
both us and saudi officials declined to provide a specific 
price tag for the commitment 
british prime minister margaret thatcher pledged more forces to 
bolster the us contingent in the gulf she did not elaborate on 
the deployment plans 
egypt too said it was beefing up its small gulf contingent 
at the united nations diplomats said un secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar planned to send an envoy to occupied kuwait 
to meet with diplomats whose embassies are surrounded by iraqi 
troops and with trapped foreigners baghdad would have to give its 
consent for the visit 
the state department again blasted iraq for its treatment of 
foreign nationals including the shooting of an american in kuwait 
who was trying to avoid capture 
department spokesman mark dillen called iraqs behavior 
outrageous and the deparment summoned the iraqi ambassador to 
the united states mohamed almashat to lodge a formal protest 
almashat later called the incident unfortunate he told 
reporters the man had been slightly injured because he 
violated the curfew and not because he was picked up as an 
american 
washington and moscow meanwhile scrambled to prepare for the 
weekend superpower summit they hope will bring a break in the 
nearly 5weekold crisis 
president bush said the united states was determined to force 
iraqi president saddam hussein to withdraw from kuwait which iraqi 
troops overran aug 2 in a dispute over land money and oil 
we will not stand by while one country devours another 
unthreatening country whole bush said at a kansas fundraiser 
our cause may not be easy but it will always be right 
in a surprise move bush said he would make a statement for 
broadcast to the iraqi people saying he saw a real opportunity 
to explain the us view baghdad had offered to broadcast an 
interview with bush but the white house said the president would 
tape a statement instead 
statements by the iraqi president which white house wags call 
saddamathons have received ample air time in the united 
states and the bush administration was reportedly irritated about 
this 
word that moscow might support a un military force in the gulf 
came from soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov he 
indicated mikhail s gorbachev may discuss the idea with bush at 
their summit sunday in helsinki finland 
previously the soviets had said only that they might 
participate if the united nations decided to deploy a military 
force 
we have to go back to the un charter and revive certain 
clauses of this charter which may have armed forces 
international armed forces at its disposal so as to keep 
international peace and security gerasimov told reporters 
gerasimov spoke a day after iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz 
met with gorbachev and displayed no softening in iraqs refusal to 
leave kuwait moscow and baghdad were longtime allies but 
gorbachev has condemned the kuwait invasion as treachery 
expenses escalate daily for the us military deployment and 
treasury secretary nicholas brady arrived thursday in seoul south 
korea the latest stop on a tour to press allies for funds 
secretary of state james a baker iii was making the same pitch in 
saudi arabia where much of the us force is deployed 
in iraq the outlook grew grimmer for trapped foreigners 
baghdad said those caught trying to leave without permission could 
face life in prison 
justice minister akram abdulkader said authorities were 
reviving a 1987 law that a foreigner violating the entry and exit 
procedures will be sentenced to life or temporary imprisonment 
and all cash in his possession will be confiscated 
the state department said iraqi authorities had informed us 
officials that an american shot by iraqi police in kuwait was 
expected to be discharged from a hospital shortly but will remain 
in iraqi custody the department spokesman dillen said the 
american was wounded while attempting to evade capture at his 
apartment in kuwait city 
we hold the iraqi government responsible for the health and 
welfare of all american citizens held against their will in kuwait 
and iraq dillen said 
westerners were continuing to make their way out of iraq and 
kuwait under saddams promise to free foreign women and children 
western men are being held as human shields to protect iraqi 
installations 
an air france jet flew into paris from jordan on thursday 
carrying 153 westerners allowed to leave iraq including at least 
nine americans 
a canadianchartered iraqi plane carrying 157 people most of 
them canadians was headed for toronto after leaving iraq and 
kuwait and letting off five people during a stopover in turkey a 
dozen americans were among the passengers 
the state department also said it expected a uschartered 
iraqi airways flight would leave baghdad on friday 
a british airways charter took off from amman for london early 
friday carrying 250 british women and children refugees from 
kuwait happy to be free but expressing fears for husbands left 
behind they arrived thursday in jordan on two iraqi airways 
charter flights from baghdad 
a british convoy arrived in baghdad from kuwait on thursday with 
182 women and children british diplomats in baghdad said a second 
convoy including nine americans had also left kuwait 
asians and arabs were having an easier time than westerners at 
getting iraqi permission to leave but a much more difficult time 
getting home more than 100000 asian refugees are stuck in jordan 
lacking transportation to get them back home 
meanwhile there were signs the international unity against 
baghdad might be cracking china and iran suggested that food and 
medicine should be sent to iraq despite the un economic sanctions 
chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman li jinhua said thursday the 
un embargo does not include supplies intended strictly for 
medical purposes and foodstuffs for humanitarian purposes 
irans president hashemi rafsanjani said last month that iran 
would abide by the embargo but the englishlanguage tehran times 
which is close to rafsanjani said in an editorial thursday that 
providing food and medicine was a humanitarian question 
in other developments 
arab diplomats in baghdad said king hussein of jordan might fly 
to moscow for talks with gorbachev in advance of the helsinki 
summit the jordanian monarch returned home thursday after two days 
of talks with saddam 
oil prices soared over 31 a barrel thursday reaching that 
plateau for the second time since the persian gulf crisis as 
traders bet that supply shortages will develop 
the stock market took a sharp dive in the face of rising oil 
prices with the dow jones industrial average falling 3193 points

nasa engineers embarrassed again by 
a space shuttle that cant fly set off anew today on a hunt 
through a tangle of pipes for an elusive fuel leak that grounded 
columbia for a third time 
it is a real booger to try to find and isolate shuttle boss 
robert crippen said after the mission was scrubbed wednesday 7 
hours before columbia was to have lifted off at 120 am today 
with the 150 million astro observatory 
engineers worked on a troubleshooting plan through the night 
but crippen said that even if the hole were found immediately 
columbia could not leave on its long astronomy mission for at least 
three or four days and probably longer 
the launch would have been the 36th shuttle flight and the first 
in four months after a summer of similar leaks for nasa that is 
the longest gap between missions since flights resumed following 
the challenger disaster

the median net income of officebased physicians 
rose 128 percent last year to 132500 and the credit may go to 
the doctors themselves they are becoming better businessmen 
a survey by the magazine medical economics found the 1989 median 
income rose 14770 the biggest dollar increase in the 61 years 
the survey has been conducted by the financial publication for 
physicians 
the article describing the study suggested higher incomes 
resulted more from better business practices especially more 
efficient bill collection than from a larger number of patient 
visits or higher fees 
it points out in fact that while median gross receipts rose 
sharply much of the revenue was gobbled up by a 198 percent 
rise in professional expenses the steepest such increase of the 
decade 
nevertheless the higher incomes could provoke controversy 
because they come at a time when business insurers patients 
federal officials and the medical profession itself are seeking to 
hold down steadily rising costs 
the article points out that while the typical doctor had lost 
six of his nine most recent yearly skirmishes with inflation 1989 
put him comfortably ahead for the decade 
while the consumer price index rose 644 percent from december 
1979 to december 1989 the article states that doctors cumulative 
annual earnings growth for the period topped that figure by 84 
percentage points 
however doctors in family or general practice earned 
considerably less than the median with the former grossing 
211540 and netting 97340 and the latter grossing 170423 and 
netting 86860 
the study was based on questionnaires mailed in january to 
31976 medical doctors in private officebased practice by the 
midmay cutoff date 9762 responses had been trimmed to a working 
sample of 6484 questionnaires 
the magazine stated that the survey was representative in terms 
of physicians field of practice region and age and therefore 
likely to be representative in other ways as well 
the responses showed cardiovascular surgeons as the highest paid 
of all medical doctors with a gross income of 493750 and a net 
of 296300 followed by neurosurgeons at 455560 and 256600 
respectively 
orthopedic surgeons plastic surgeons and ophthalmologists 
followed all with net incomes exceeding 200000 obstetric and 
gynecological specialists thoracic surgeons anesthesiologists and 
earnosethroat specialists followed at just under 200000 
among other specialties general surgeons were said to have 
netted a median of 143130 internists 110500 psychiatrists 
103570 and pediatricians 101800 
the highest median net for medical doctors in general was found 
in the south atlantic states at 143500 in the midsouth at 
143300 and in the far west including alaska and hawaii at 
135420 
in order below them were the southwest states at 132500 the 
mideast states of new york pennsylvania and new jersey at 
131790 the great lakes region at 125830 new england at 
125000 and the great plains at 123750 
the survey found the highest gross and net incomes in florida 
at 282500 and 157950 respectively representing a oneyear 
increase of 34820 or 283 percent 
in his commentary medical economics editor don berg stated that 
this year could well be the last one of really big increases 
before medicare caps and other restrictions begin

trip shakespeare has been living on the road for 
three years the van rides are long the hotels look the same but 
business hassles are left to others 
it doesnt feel bad compared to what the minnesotabased band 
was doing before holding onto parttime jobs and making the rounds 
at the local clubs no ones longing for that way of life 
trip shakespeare is happiest on stage when they can open up to 
each other learn a few things about themselves and create a world 
a little prettier than the one they come down to once the 
instruments are unplugged 
that is almost the ultimate goal for us making music 
explained bassist john munson thats something we want to do in 
performance create a different world a place where everyone can 
be where the audience can be forget the drudging pains of life 
and bill collection and so on 
fitting for a band that numbers dr seuss and rocky and 
bullwinkle among its influences trip shakespeare includes plenty 
of fractured fairy tales on across the universe their first 
album on a major label aampm records 
the slacks is a naughty dance song about a oneeyed lady 
from france with a fatal weakness for magic trousers theres also 
snow days a call from indoors to poor mrs braintree a 
minnesota schoolteacher and chilly northern woman stranded in a 
winter blizzard and pearle whose lovely heroine meets her 
fate along the gullies by deegan curve 
the love songs are open and painful with no trace of bitterness 
or hardened acceptance of loss only a childlike grief over 
something so natural being taken away just listen to the ballad 
drummer like me when the singer slips into a gentle falsetto 
on oh listen some drummers have shaky time his voice full of 
doubt and fear 
a lot of people that come to see us are pretty wideeyed 
theres not a lot of cynicism munson insisted 
because we jam a lot do it differently every time there has 
to be a level of trust between the band and audience and the 
audience is of all different sizes shapes and colors theyre open 
to what were saying 
one thing that the songs have in common is they are works of 
the imagination added guitaristpianist dan wilson who spoke of 
honey tree another ballad 
the honey tree is someplace beyond this world the garden 
where that romance takes place is otherearthly its real in the 
same way that a dream is real 
trip shakespeare formed in minneapolis in late 1986 as a trio 
the members including matt wilson dans brother and who also 
writes all the lyrics munson and drummer elaine harris dan 
wilson joined a year later 
there are no rap songs or exotic drugs or summer arts festivals 
called trip shakespeare the band members simply made up the name 
one night and liked the sound of it literary and humorous at the 
same time 
they released a pair of albums applehead man and are you 
shakespearienced on independent labels before signing with aampm 
the sound is appropriately not quite of this world a combination 
of garage bands folk harmonies and oldies albums sold on 
latenight television 
somebody came up to us and said i know the left banke and 
jeff beck munson recalled and then someone will come up and 
say the zombies and mott the hoople or you guys sound like a 
cross between peter paul and mary and led zeppelin 
a lot of things about the band just sort of developed 
organically we never sat down and said lets cop a folk sound 
or lets get on that alternative music jag 
records are made with live shows in mind and it works in the 
other direction the same way movie studios preview films to test 
audience reaction trip shakespeare experiments with its material 
on stage bending notes to the roar of the crowd 
the road i travel is not divine they sing on 
turtledove the routine these days is pretty simple hit town 
set up the equipment and play try to give the audience and 
themselves and a world of honey trees in the sky and blessings on 
the ground 
about a year after dan joined the band we were in iowa city 
playing to about 250 people in a small room dan wilson said 
we took one song and wrestled with it on stage 
we stretched it pulled it at its edges and ran off on 
tangents for 25 minutes just exploring the contours of the song 
with each member taking off in different directions that was a 
moment when we realized something special was happening

you want action send for the norris 
brothers chuck and aaron 
chuck we know about hes the nimblefooted stolidfaced 
destroyer of evil aaron is his younger brother a former stuntman 
now director of chucks films including the current delta force 
2 
they recently got together at mgm for a discussion on how they 
work together 
aarons first film as director was braddock missing in 
action 3 but aaron had worked with me for 12 years as stunt 
coordinator on my films chuck said id seen him as a 
secondunit director as i watched him i said this guy has a 
tremendous amount of creative talent hes very focused if he ever 
gets the opportunity to direct i think hell do exceptionally 
well 
the opportunity came when the director of braddock quit the 
producer rejected chucks suggestion of his brother as director 
because of lack of preparation the substitute director got 
lost during the philippines locations aaron to the rescue 
one thing about chuck is he has focus he knows where his 
character is and where he should be at that given scene its a 
great quality aaron said 
we collaborate as a team because one man never runs an entire 
movie the director has the focus of the entire film but he 
listens to everyone around him thats why you hire all these 
talented people 
what happens when they disagree 
chuck recalled a scene in delta force 2 for which aarons 
instructions ran counter to chucks instincts the director 
suggested shooting the scene two ways deciding later which one was 
right 
we looked at the dailies the next day and he was right 
chuck laughed i never questioned him after that 
any chance of sibling rivalry affecting their work together 
chuck commented aarons a lot younger than me when we were 
growing up our mother had to work so i babysat aaron i must have 
spanked him a few times because now hes paying me back 
thats the beauty of this whole thing added aaron with a 
laugh for anyone who has had an older brother this is a chance 
to get back at him for all that stuff he gave me when i was young 
i put him through his paces on delta force 2 
indeed chuck norris does some of his most perilous stunts 
including the scaling of a 12000foot peak and leaping out of an 
airplane 
but theres a limit aaron said i came up through the 
stunt community i understand where that limit is but hes real 
game i get him in tight places but you go first and foremost for 
safety the last thing i ever want to do is hurt anybody 
for delta force 2 the norris brothers returned to the 
philippines which doubles for colombia where chuck is warring 
against the biggest drug lord of all will they become a permanent 
team 
i would like for it to be whether aaron directs or 
produces answered chuck if it works out that way well be a 
team in whatever the capacities may be we work well together

theres something reassuring about watching a 
televised treasure hunt on the bottom of the sea 
in this type of reality tv there are no killings or threats of 
gasoline shortages no naval blockades or smiling dictators 
stroking a captive child there are just lovely dreams of gold 
thats not to say its easy finding let alone digging up 
sunken treasure a mile and a half below the waves 
the twohour treasures of a lost voyage airing sunday night 
on cables discovery channel demonstrates why 
the longlost ship ss central america had to be pinpointed 
under thousands of square miles of ocean off the south carolina 
coast 
the recovery crew then had to endure unpredictable weather 
temperamental spaceage retrieval equipment and costly legal 
fights with other searchers and a host of insurance companies over 
who actually owns the estimated 3 tons of gold nuggets assay bars 
and coins that sank with the ship in 1857 
its a battle of man against nature its also a battle of man 
against machines said barry schatz one of three project 
directors for the ohio group of investors and scientists that 
located the wreck site in june 1986 
schatz also could have said lawyer against lawyer 
it took four years and precedentsetting court rulings in a 
norfolk va federal court for his columbus america discovery 
group to establish the legal right to a treasure that could be 
worth 1 billion at auction 
while the court battle dragged on columbus americas innovative 
6ton robot retrievercamera vehicle nemo quietly plied the 
wreckage bringing up more than 2000 pieces of gold bars and coins 
through last summer 
experts believe that represents about a third of the gold that 
weighed down the steam sidewheeler central america when it 
foundered in a hurricane in september 1857 while en route from 
panama to new york 
it will take this and another summerfall salvage season at 
least for nemo to collect the mostaccessible artifacts from an 
area the size of a football field schatz said 
the ship which carried 500 passengers and freight from the 
california gold fields took three days to sink as passengers and 
crew bailed in vain four hundred twentyfive people died with 
some of the survivors telling of desperate passengers jumping 
overboard fatally weighted down with gold 
the discovery program combines documentary footage of the gold 
rush era with footage from the exciting 1986 discovery along with 
satellitedelivered views from the recovery vessel arctic 
discoverer to update the progress of current salvage efforts 
nemos cameras reveal startling images of piles and 
waterfalls of gold coins bars and other artifacts the views 
are carried by wire up to a computercrammed control room on the 
recovery vessel 
there far from the crushing pressures and dark cold of the 
wreck site scientists under the direction of geologisthistorian 
bob evans control retrieval and research 
it is increasingly common for tv cameras to accompany 
adventurers or journalists even diplomats into the heat of the 
action but in this case television actually helped make the event 
happen 
the columbus america group in what schatz said was a first 
established its right to bring up the gold by possessing the 
site through tv images rather than actually laying hands on the 
booty through manned diving 
we were able to exert a presence and take possession as if we 
were actually physically there schatz said calling the new 
legal doctrine telepresence or telepossession 
this will have very important applications for outerspace 
law he said 
the search for the ss central america begun by columbus 
america founder thomas thompson was motivated by gold but 
scientists realized the search would afford a unique opportunity to 
study the oceanbottom environment 
the shipwreck is a biological oasis schatz said it has 
attracted an incredible diversity of deep sea life 
three as yet unidentified species of life have been retrieved 
as well as a type of sponge that may prove useful in fighting 
arthritis he said 
these unexpected spinoffs are icing on the cake for an already 
spectacularly successful salvage effort 
the investors said hey lets find gold schatz said 
but theyre really proud to be part of this other activity as 
well

into the woods stephen sondheims broadway 
musical fairy tale takes on a grimmer look in london with 
bloodstreaked walls and a moon that crashes down in the second act 
its a steady descent into bleakness and blackness said 
julia mckenzie who plays the witch in the 1987 sondheimjames 
lapine musical opening sept 25 at londons phoenix theater 
the show budgeted at 12 million pounds 223 million is 
directed by richard jones and designed by richard hudson a team 
who have been working jointly in opera and the subsidized theater 
for the past decade 
into the woods is the second sondheim musical to receive a 
major british production this year his 1984 sunday in the park 
with george finished a 15week run june 16 at the royal national 
theater 
into the woods won three tony awards including one for 
sondheims score but some critics saw it as a schizophrenic work 
whose halves never quite meshed 
the first act sends such fairy tale characters as little red 
riding hood and cinderella into the woods where all end up 
living happily ever after their wishes fulfilled in act 2 their 
happiness proves shortlived a marauding giant emerges in the 
woods bringing death and devastation and belatedly teaching the 
characters the importance of responsibility and companionship 
mckenzie inheriting bernadette peters broadway role said this 
new production would differ greatly from its predecessor for a 
start the british cast can use its own accents because the show 
is set in no particular country 
its going to be very much one piece here she said it 
wont look as pretty as in new york therefore youll be more 
prepared for the ending 
this is mckenzies fourth sondheim musical in london following 
company side by side by sondheim and follies 
sondheim is writing a song for her into the woods role that 
wasnt in the longrunning new york version 
designer richard hudson said he based his sets on extravagant 
drawings from victorian childrens books german fairy tales culled 
from londons goethe institute and the 19thcentury french 
illustrator gustave dore 
its a question of finding the right balance he said im 
quite keen to make the show nastier its entertaining and 
delightful but there are moments where you go oh my god 
accordingly the wallpaper of act 1 will be seen peeling in act 
2 the benign moon hovering over the set will crash to the ground 
and when the wolf kills the grandmother the walls will be streaked 
with blood 
its been very very meticulously worked out said hudson 
explaining that the tone should be kind of pessimistic 
director richard jones wanted it to rain on stage at the end 
but they decided against that hudson said the irony is that 
these characters all talk about happy ever after but their lives 
are not that brilliant 
the show walks a very very fine line between shock horror and 
laughter that is near hysteria said mckenzie

climb inside the 1991 pontiac firebird formula and youd swear 
it was 1967 all over again 
just like during the muscle car era theres no slinking quietly 
around the streets the throaty rumble of the 1991 firbirds v8 
engine just emanates from below even at idle 
inside are all the trappings of a traditional american sports 
car low bodyhugging cloth seats rear legroom thats miniscule 
and that big hump in the middle of the floor that indicates the car 
is reardrive as always 
sure the front and rear fascias have been restyled for the new 
model but all they succeed in doing is giving even more sporty 
flair to the car than the previous model had and a new rear 
spoiler adds to the lookatme firebird package 
some things never change horsepower image and flair were 
hallmarks of the earliest firebird they remain today 
the test car a bright speedingticketred firebird formula 
had me fighting butterflies in my stomach when i punched the 
accelerator and felt the car surge forward there was no waiting as 
the optional tunedport fuelinjected 5liter engine mated to 
fivespeed manual transmission responded capable of delivering 225 
horsepower 
suspension was stiff offering good handling but a rough ride 
over harsh bumps but i wasnt on the bumps for long this car just 
flew over them 
fuel economy was as expected a bit low at just 16 miles per 
gallon in city driving i had to get used to looking over the air 
dam on the front hood it is positioned right in front of the 
driver and with my 5foot4 stature i had to sit up straight and 
peer over the dam 
i also had to get used to the long heavy doors they took a big 
heave to shove open 
and there wasnt a lot of space in the rear hatch area 
still no one can really expect great storage space in a sports 
car besides power and handling the sound system and ambience are 
important 
in the firebird the premium sound system with graphic 
equalizer a 150 option was superb and the smallish thick 
steering wheel seemed a perfect fit the dashboard design harkened 
back to the 1960s when the top shelf of the dashboard jutted way 
in toward passengers in the 1991 firebird there was about a 
3inch overhang where the top of the dash came over and stuck out 
above the wide array of large traditional analog gauges 
typical buyers of the firebird formula are men 70 percent who 
are single said company spokesman reg harris twothirds are under 
age 35 and between 30 percent and 40 percent have college degrees 
he said the firebird in all its models the standard firebird 
firebird formula firebird trans am and firebird trans am gta 
sells particularly well on the west coast and in the carolinas and 
the southeast he added 
it is interesting to note that more than twothirds of firebird 
purchasers are firsttime newcar buyers harris said they tend to 
fall into one of two categories the first group is people who put 
great emphasis on the look of their car they want the car of 
their dreams they are not necessarily car enthusiasts but they 
do want their car to give them a certain powerful image he said 
the second group is people who like domestic cars who are 
traditional car fans harris said these people can be 
conservative in accepting new automotive technology and want a 
vehicle thats tried and true 
they certainly get it with the firebird introduced in february 
1967 the firebird has racked up sales of more than 22 million 
over the last 23 years 
the best model year was 1978 when 175607 were sold according 
to pontiac in recent years sales have hovered around 
5000060000 for 1991 the company looks for sales between 50000 
and 55000 prices range from 11985 for the standard firebird to 
more than 23400 for the topoftheline gta 
competitors include the ford mustang which has a 5liter engine 
model that starts around 12100 the eagle talon which starts 
around 13000 and the toyota supra which starts at more than 
22800 
consumer reports says 198387 firebird v8s were much worse than 
average in owner complaints of trouble and the 1988 model was 
worse than average harris said the company has made many 
improvements to bolster quality

freshman us sen tom harkin is battling 
history in his bid to defeat republican challenger and congressman 
tom tauke 
iowa voters never have given a democratic us senator another 
term in office and tauke is doing his best to ensure that harkin 
doesnt become the first 
the two men are waging the most expensive political fight in 
iowa history harkin plans to spend 6 million and tauke a 
sixterm congressman from northeast iowa hopes to answer with 5 
million 
nowhere in the country harkin warned supporters recently will 
voters have a clearer choice this year and nowhere will democrats 
be pushed harder 
theyre coming after me with everything theyve got said 
harkin 
the candidates began airing television commercials last spring 
they have disagreed on abortion rights the persian gulf crisis 
and how theyre paying for their wellfinanced campaigns 
through it all harkin 50 has clung to a stubborn lead of 10 
to 12 percentage points in most polls though hes dropped 
perilously close to 50 percent in those surveys 
republicans argue that tauke 39 has positioned himself to 
overtake harkin in the stretch while democrats say tauke hasnt 
made a dent in that lead and is running out of time 
were surprised that the race is not closer said harkin 
spokesman phil roeder a year ago heading into this campaign we 
anticipated it would be a dead heat going into the final couple of 
months and its not 
we couldnt be happier with where we are said tauke 
spokesman allen finch its labor day and harkin hasnt moved in 
over a year and weve stayed within 10 points 
harkin has emerged as a pesky critic of republican presidents 
and gop officials concede hes a tough campaigner 
absolutely this is a tough one said iowa republican 
chairman richard schwarm this senate race was going to be tough 
any time but tom harkin has proven relatively slippery 
democrats have built a voter registration edge of roughly 
100000 but a republican can certainly win statewide in iowa 
with those numbers said schwarm 
the candidates are conducting an unprecedented series of four 
primetime debates broadcast on live commercial television 
throughout the state 
tauke dug himself into a hole in the most recent campaign debate 
focusing on abortion rights some analysts say in a state where 
nearly twothirds of voters consider themselves prochoice tauke 
staked out the hardest of antiabortion positions ruling out 
abortions even for rape and incest victims 
harkin took a more moderate approach outlining a generally 
prochoice position but saying he would be willing to consider 
measures such as limited requirements that a parent be notified 
before a minor gets an abortion 
taukes staffers argue that he has long held antiabortion 
views and couldnt afford to waffle on the issue critics said he 
missed a chance to reach out to more moderate voters 
democrats saw it as one more thing going their way 
i dont think weve seen a challenging candidate run such a 
poor campaign said iowa democratic party spokesman joe shannahan 
but finch argued that issues like abortion are fading from 
voters minds in the face of world events 
i think what can be said is the persian gulf has overshadowed 
virtually all other issues he said 
weve got our base solidified and were in single digits and 
well seek to take the message to the voters as they increasingly 
pay attention to the race said finch 
tauke is completely supportive of president bushs efforts in 
the persian gulf harkin has argued that more pressure should be 
exerted on other nations for greater support and he has criticized 
bushs decision to activate reserve units 
tauke criticizes harkin for raising 90 percent of his larger 
contributions from outside the state harkin responds that he has 
backed campaign finance legislation thwarted by republicans in 
congress 
both candidates are veteran campaigners harkin represented 
southwest iowas 5th district for 10 years before ousting incumbent 
republican sen roger jepsen in 1984 tauke has represented the 
heavily democratic 2nd district for 12 years

producer arnold shapiro had a head start in 
shooting the cbs movie on bostons stuart murder case or so it 
would seem 
he just happened to have a camera crew in the area the night of 
the incident arriving at the scene minutes after charles stuart 
was shot and his pregnant wife carol was mortally wounded 
the crew working for shapiros cbs series rescue 911 was 
chasing the ambulance that pulled up to the bleeding couple on the 
evening of oct 23 1989 the dramatic footage of the stuarts being 
removed from their car and given emergency treatment was broadcast 
last february to a wide audience 
but the rescue 911 crew shot on videotape and the stuart 
movie became a 35mm film project the two mediums dont cut 
together effectively so everything was reenacted 
shapiros location in boston that night gave him a head start of 
a different kind however in the industry rush to film the stuart 
story the producer had a leg up on the competition 
we had all this research and all the contacts shapiro said 
everyone in hollywood wanted to do the movie but wed already 
been on it 
good night sweet wife a murder in boston scheduled for 
tuesday night stars ken olin as stuart and margaret colin as 
michelle caruso a reporter who doubted stuarts story of the 
shootings 
boston police had vigorously searched for the killer in the 
citys black community after stuart said the couple had been 
attacked by a black man a black suspect even was jailed for a 
time sparking allegations of police racism and raising ethnic 
tensions 
charles stuart who was white eventually became the prime 
suspect in the slaying of his wife as a web of evidence engulfed 
him he committed suicide in january of this year 
the racial issues this story raises are not unique to boston 
we need to explore why stuart was able to fool virtually 
everyone shapiro said a large part of this movie is trying to 
understand stuarts behavior if one police department is more 
skeptical the next time a similar crime occurs i will be 
fulfilled 
michelle caruso a crime reporter for the boston herald was one 
of the few people who doubted stuarts story from the start he 
said 
this shows you should not act in haste shapiro said the 
media and the police bought chuck stuarts story hook line and 
sinker he said a black man did it and that set off a near racial 
war the husband or the boyfriend is always a suspect in a murder 
like this why wasnt chuck because his selfinflicted wound was 
so bad he nearly died 
shapiro moved the stuart movies production site to chicago to 
avoid any incidents in boston where passions still run high over 
the case 
the movie also stars bd wong james handy bruce mcgill 
michael c gwynne and annabella price as carol stuart jerrold 
freedman directed from a screenplay by dan freudenberger 
all the actors looked at the 911 show and all the raw 
footage to make it as accurate as possible shapiro said its 
been a challenging movie to make as of this date the grand jury 
hasnt come back with its findings about whether any living person 
should be charged there are some things we may never know that 
chuck stuart may have taken to the grave 
the stuart film was to have been broadcast opposite the season 
premiere of abcs thirtysomething which also stars olin but 
mgm television producers of thirtysomething objected and the 
stuart movie was postponed a week 
this is not the first time shapiro has turned a documentary 
situation into a television movie his 1978 academy awardwinning 
documentary scared straight became the 1980 cbs movie scared 
straight another story 
the walls in shapiros office are covered with pictures and 
mementos that attest to his documentaries on aviation the battle 
of iwo jima american prisoners of war the unknown soldier and the 
korean war 
as his 911 goes into its third season hes preparing a new 
reality series for cbs called true detectives which will tell 
stories of professional and amateur sleuths who solved baffling 
mysteries 
the biggest challenge in filming the stuart story shapiro said 
was not the uncertain ending but cutting the wealth of material to 
fit a twohour format 
i think this is a story that could have happened in any 
american city he said it offers some broad national lessons 
you cant say enough about the horror of violence against women and 
children that one reason alone would be enough for me to make this 
movie

language romany is spoken by most unassimilated gypsies it is 
an ancient language rooted in sanskrit or early hindi and has 
evolved differently in each east european country some versions of 
romany are so divergent that hungarian gypsies for instance have 
trouble communicating with those from romania or bulgaria

history the first gypsies arrived in europe about 900 years 
ago from northern india but mass migrations to the continent did 
not begin until the 14th century their nomadic lifestyle and 
refusal to adapt led to increasing persecution in western europe 
and migration to the eastern regions where they were allowed to 
work as itinerant craftsmen and musicians and in other nomadic 
occupations 
pressure to conform was applied systematically in the late 18th 
century when austrias queen maria theresa who controlled much of 
eastern europe issued decrees designed to assimilate gypsies 
forcibly into the serf class persecution continued culminating in 
the nazi extermination of an estimated 500000 gypsies

for weeks the denizens of midtown manhattan had 
puzzled about the strange pervasive grinding noises audible in the 
streets and in the the corridors of the towering skyscapers 
it turned out of course that the sounds were network 
television executives wearing out the enamel on their molars 
what has gone wrong with the republic they wondered from 90 
percent of the potential tv audience in 1980 the big three had 
sunk to splitting 65 percent between them where had all the people 
gone 
the fall television season of 1990 was approaching they were 
out of ideas there was nothing left to do but make something up 
or head for the sidewalk either by the elevator or a long 
whistling free fall out the window 
so they came up with 35 new shows the greatest number of 
original programs in tv history nineteen of them 543 percent 
are situation comedies and as usual there are precious few 
programs worth celebrating 
the biggest disappointment is fox broadcasting co which got a 
reputation for innovative programming fox scared the big three 
spitless by stealing 10 percent of the viewership without even 
reaching the entire country 
judging by its fall offerings the weblet has gone from limber 
youth to doddering old age 
five of its 10 shows are sitcoms one true colors is the 
mildest statement about biracial marriage since good luck you 
crazy kids youre going to need it it does not remotely 
resemble innovative programming 
even though corin nemec plays a greedy little hustler the 
networks parker lewis cant lose is a fun fine highschool 
fantasy bound to appeal to younger viewers its just too bad that 
the show foxs best new comedy stops at satirizing high school 
american chronicles a slick sleek documentary is visually 
classy but its popular appeal is uncertain dea is visually 
distinctive but turns out to be just another cop show thats 
underwritten somewhat more than most 
both fox and abc have done their bit to hasten the demise of 
home video programming 
abcs americas funniest home videos has tacked on the 
wretched americas funniest people and fox has added 
haywire to its totally hidden video both shows feature 
americans making fools of themselves 
abc offers only six new shows which reflects the strength of 
their established programs half of the new crop are sitcoms and 
only two of the six are worth watching 
gabriels fire brings james earl jones back to television 
where his strength and dignity are sorely needed he plays an 
excon excop who brings the skills of both to his job as a 
lawyers investigator 
cop rock is steven bochcos engaging knockoff of dennis 
potters stylish pennies from heaven and the singing 
detective but even those two pbs miniseries never tried to blend 
rock music and police action 
the show works but its an open question whether music 
supervisor mike post can find composers capable of keeping up the 
standard set by randy newman in the series premiere 
thirdranked cbs whose 11 new shoes were the most offered by 
any network had the fewest shows ready for reviewers some of them 
wont see the airwaves until october 
evening shade will have to fall through the earths crust to 
fail is it even possible that a sitcom could fail with a cast of 
burt reynolds marilu henner elizabeth ashley ossie davis 
charles durning and hal holbrook 
wiou also not available for previews has a cast that 
includes john shea helen shaver mariette hartley dick van 
patten harris yulin and phil morris its about tv journalism and 
has all kinds of chances to fail 
the little screen has not been kind to comic book superheroes 
so unless the flash has great special effects and even better 
writing the scarlet speedsters prospects for renewal are dimmer 
than the six million dollar mans 
theyre not dimmer than earth force which is by turns 
pompous improbable ungrammatical and unintentionally funny 
five of nbcs nine new shows are worth making time for 
the long pilot episode for parenthood was one of the best 
shows in the preview crop with ed begley jr and william windom in 
peak form its a halfhour that cries out for another 30 minutes 
just to let the characters breathe 
despite the grimsounding premise of a high school musical 
comedy hull high makes a joyful noise its clever funny 
full of subtle touches and it genuinely likes teenagers and the 
people who teach them 
another winner is american dreamer which brings the 
wonderful carol kane back to tv and proves that robert urich can 
indeed do comedy the script is funny and the chemistry between 
kane and urich is unmistakable 
the fanelli boys is the best sitcom nbc has to offer mama 
ann guilbert and her four sons are a funny bunch 
law amp order stars george dzundza as a police detective who 
arrests criminals and michael moriarty plays the prosecutor who 
tries them the hour goes quickly 
there may be other worthwhile shows but theyre still not 
available to reviewers 
the start of the network season still is sept 17 but the 
network executives have thoroughly confused things by trying to 
stir up interest in the shows theyve already got in the can 
nbc ran a double pump and previewed several shows ahead of 
that date fox put out early episodes of its shows too cbs and 
abc scheduled a few early shows the week before the official season 
at the end of august ac nielsen co expanded its known 
universe of us television households from 921 million to 
931 million even though the audience is dwindling and becoming as 
independentminded as a hog on ice 
what would happen if the executives gave a fall tv season and 
nobody came

the tidy gray hair impeccable tweeds and 
respectable air immediately identified dame agatha christie an 
uppermiddleclass englishwoman of a time and place when class 
defined a persons life 
child of prosperous and loving parents loyal wife and devoted 
mother she was a woman who spent more than 50 years writing about 
murder hatred jealousy and guilt with a cool skill that made her 
one of the bestselling novelists ever 
dame agatha born sept 15 100 years ago wrote 147 short 
stories 15 plays and 90 novels most of which are still readily 
available at neighborhood bookstores they have sold more than 2 
billion copies in 45 languages and 14 years after her death they 
sell about 25 million copies a year her publisher says 
some of them sell better now than when first published and 
this without sex obscene words overt violence or naked passion 
she was the patron saint of insomniacs anthony curtis said 
in the financial times after her death in 1976 her readers were 
not merely legion they included most literate persons above the 
age of 10 
despite her fame agatha christie spent most of her life well 
out of the public eye a shy and intensely private woman who 
probably would have been dismayed to discover what a fuss is being 
made over her centenary 
her birthplace the south coast town of torquay is holding an 
international crime writers convention a series of lectures on the 
author and the world championships of the mystery board game cluedo 
clue in the united states 
the local theater is reviving christie plays new editions of 
her books are appearing and hotels are holding murder weekends 
for guests to play detective 
the mousetrap her most famous play is still going strong 
in london after 38 years and has been seen by more than 85 million 
people 
lavish films of christie stories have been huge tv and film 
successes actors as diverse as peter ustinov albert finney and 
david suchet have portrayed detective hercule poirot while angela 
lansbury and joan hickson pick up miss marple where margaret 
rutherford left off 
an agatha christie murder seems cozy and polite committed for 
the most part out of sight by the most ordinary people her books 
are filled with comfortable stereotypes of benign clerics 
gossiping spinsters foolish servants and retired military men 
less comfortable racial and religious stereotypes also crop up 
some critics say agatha christie was not a particularly good 
writer and she was always modest about her gifts 
im very lowbrow she said in 1971 while expressing surprise 
at being made a dame by queen elizabeth ii a lot of people have 
written books 
but others such as hrf keating admire her she was very 
skillful her timing was marvelous and she was a very good 
storyteller 
she was a reasonably ordinary person in herself and didnt 
attempt to be more in her writing so she appeals to the ordinary 
in all of us said keating author of the inspector ghote 
mysteries and president of the venerable detection club of crime 
writers which christie headed for many years 
she had a powerful imagination and an inventiveness that 
blossomed so she said in the bath there she ate apples as she 
soaked plotting her next story 
her most famous character is poirot the tidy belgian detective 
with the waxed mustache who solved 34 of her mysteries in books and 
dozens more in short stories christie introduced him in her first 
novel the mysterious affair at styles published in 1920 
the endearingly egotistical poirot with his patent leather 
shoes and exquisite tailoring solves puzzles with his little 
gray cells imposing order on tangled clues in the same 
meticulous way he arranges his perfectly symmetrical life 
christie brought poirot back in 1926 for the murder of roger 
ackroyd the book that made her famous with a shocking ending 
that nobody but nobody could guess readers who had watched every 
one of the suspects eliminated cried foul when they found out 
whodunit but they didnt stop reading agatha christie 
seven months after roger ackroyd made her a celebrity this 
reserved woman with a horror of publicity created a sensation 
agatha christie disappeared dec 3 1926 the day her husband 
col archibald christie told her had fallen for a young woman 
named nancy neele and wanted a divorce agathas car was found 
abandoned and a nationwide search began she was found 11 days 
later in a northern england hotel reportedly suffering from 
amnesia and registered as teresa neele she never explained not 
even in her posthumously published autobiography 
the christies divorced in 1928 their only child rosalind grew 
up with her mother in 1930 agatha christie married max mallowan 
a distinguished archaeologist 13 years younger than she whom she 
met on a trip to iraq 
eight years after roger ackroyd christie wrote one of her 
most famous books murder on the orient express in which 
poirot questions suspect after suspect on a snowbound train and 
cant seem to eliminate them 
almost as famous as poirot is jane marple the english spinster 
whose lifelong study of her village neighbors has taught her about 
motive human nature is much the same everywhere miss marple 
points out homing in on the murderer without dropping a stitch of 
her knitting 
christies skills were selftaught her mother believed 
education would be hard on her eyes so she kept her at home a 
substantial house where she was born agatha miller the youngest of 
three children 
her wealthy american father was fond of his club her doting 
mother presided over a household run by servants and young agatha 
absorbed the details of uppermiddleclass life that would set so 
many scenes in her mysteries 
these settings enhanced in nostalgic detail in films and 
television today seem as much a part of the christie appeal as do 
the stories here perhaps more perfect than they ever really were 
are the 1930s chic of londons bright young things and the 
sundappled countryhouse leisure of a class that thought it would 
rule for eternity 
preserved forever are the rural hamlet with a constable on his 
bicycle and the seaside hotel with its potted palms and string 
quartet 
christie was not like the sheltered women who populate her 
fictional villages she traveled widely knew personal scandal and 
despair and met and observed people from many cultures but her 
modest manner is the image that lasts 
im not very good at talking she once said writing is a 
great consolation to people like me who cannot express themselves 
well any other way 
she said it wasnt easy 
the real hell is having to tie up all the loose ends in 
the last chapter by the time youve done it youre sick of 
everybody in the book 
she wrote poirots and miss marples last cases in the 1940s for 
posthumous publication but allowed poirots curtain to be 
published before her death 
one secret she kept for nearly 20 years until 1949 was mary 
westmacott the name under which she wrote six straight novels 
absent in the spring published in 1944 was the one book 
that satisfied me completely the book i had always wanted to 
write that had been clear in my mind 
but these novels never captured the public as her mysteries did

far from agatha christies rural village two of 
todays best crime writers have staked out their territory on the 
grimy streets of the inner city and the secret anxieties of 
suburbia 
ruth rendell and pd james hold their own at the top of 
bestseller lists and in the eyes of some critics have moved the 
crime novel toward mainstream fiction 
their concern for the why of crime and their talent for 
making killer and victim as real as your nextdoor neighbor 
separate them from most of the writers of the golden age of crime 
writing 
from the 1920s through the 1940s the upperclass sleuths of 
dorothy sayers ngaio marsh and margery allingham with their 
servants and exciting escapades offered millions of readers an 
escape from the depression and world war ii 
in those classic tales distinguished crime writer julian symons 
says the general strike of 1926 never took place trade unions 
did not exist and when sympathy was expressed for the poor it was 
not for the unemployed but for those struggling along on a fixed 
inherited income murder was committed over and over again 
without anybody getting hurt 
ruth rendell told a literary gathering long before i was 
first published the crime writer had ceased to be expected to 
assemble 12 people in a country house murder one of them and have 
a snowstorm maroon the rest indoors 
rendells 34 novels may provide escape from the readers own 
worries but they offer no refuge from the dark side of human 
nature the perverse and sexually maladjusted turn up in the world 
of her ruggedly honest provincial detective inspector reginald 
wexford and his uptight sidekick burden 
but in her nonwexford stories and the books she writes under 
the name barbara vine they get the upper hand 
a judgment in stone is about a family slain by their 
housekeeper because they discovered the secret that shamed her all 
her life she could not read or write in a a demon in my view 
judged the best crime novel of 1976 the killer takes to strangling 
real women when he is deprived of the store dummy he liked to 
throttle every now and then in the cellar 
rendells writing reflects her time with its urban 
frustrations mental stress and sense of the individual losing 
control of his own life 
like rendell phyllis dorothy james does not back away from 
violent death and the reader is not excused from the room murder 
she says is the ultimate crime the one for which you cant ever 
make reparation 
murder and its discovery are central to the book and we should 
see it experience it she said in a british broadcasting corp 
radio series on mystery writers 
the character of the victim is just as important as the 
character of anyone else in the book james said unless we 
understand him and care something about him were not going to 
care whether he dies or not 
her widowed police inspector adam dalgliesh a poet finds his 
criminals by following clues in the traditional murder mystery 
style 
but the author uses her strong anglican faith and interest in 
moral dilemmas to enrich her 11 mysteries and stretch the limits of 
crime fiction she has no interest in crime novels in which the 
murderer is a psychopath or has no sense of sin 
she is more interested in using the detective story to write a 
novel of character says critic hrf keating author of the 
inspector ghote mysteries 
she has always a whodunit interest which keeps your head 
down in the book but as you read on wanting to know whodunit you 
get these pictures of very real and interesting people seen in a 
moral climate 
theres a constant presentiment of imminent disaster in 
rendells work something she attributes to her childhood a 
loving father who nonetheless looked for sorrow rather than 
happiness in life and a mother a vague strange woman whose 
multiple sclerosis was little understood in those days 
so i think i was imbued from a very early age with a sense of 
doom the 60yearold writer said 
pd james 70 says she has been fascinated with death since 
childhood i had a feeling always when people made plans yes 
but we might not be here 
her view of humanity is stern 
the doctrine of original sin she said seems to me pretty 
well to conform to the facts we are fallen in the sense that 
basically we are selfish and violent creatures disposed really 
always to put our interests first 
the great sadness of her own life a young husband who returned 
from the war a schizophrenic and spent the rest of his life in and 
out of hospitals does not appear to have altered her perspective 
i never felt why me probably because it doesnt need very 
much imagination to look at the world and see greater suffering 
and why not me

gov rudy perpich is a nonstop booster of minnesota and not 
coincidentally his own political fortunes in a tight gubernatorial 
primary that is one of 11 elections tuesday to fill out the 1990 
campaign lineup 
we are without doubt the no 1 state in the nation perpich 
tells voters as he campaigns to stave off a tough primary challenge 
from mike hatch a former state commerce commissioner 
in other tuesday primaries arizona republicans will decide 
whether to endorse evan mechams bid to regain the office from 
which he was ousted two years ago while veteran politicians in new 
hampshire and vermont also are making comeback bids 
jesse jackson is on the district of columbia ballot for the 
symbolic office of shadow senator his first bid for an office 
other than president voters in the nations capital also will 
choose candidates in the race to succeed marion barry as the citys 
mayor 
also going to the polls on the busiest day of the primary season 
are voters in connecticut maryland new york rhode island utah 
and wisconsin 
only four states massachusetts washington hawaii and 
louisiana have yet to hold primaries runoffs are scheduled to 
settle contests in oklahoma and florida 
while the parties choose their nominees independent candidates 
are playing an unusually significant role 
former republican sen lowell weicker is running as an 
independent and leading in the polls in the race for governor of 
connecticut rep john rowland already has the republican 
nomination for governor while rep bruce morrison and state 
legislator bill cibes are competing for the democratic nomination 
gov william oneill a democrat is retiring 
in the district of columbia barry is running as an independent 
for a seat on the city council where he served before being elected 
mayor in 1978 barry was convicted last month on a misdemeanor 
charge of possession of cocaine 
city council members john ray charlene drewjarvis and david 
clarke congressional delegate walter fauntroy and lawyer sharon 
pratt dixon are the democratic contenders to succeed barry former 
police chief maurice turner is unopposed for the republican 
nomination for mayor 
jackson who moved to washington from chicago a year ago and 
mulled entering the race for mayor is one of four democrats 
seeking nomination to become one of two shadow senators whose job 
would be to lobby congress to make the city the 51st state shadow 
senators lobbied congress to win support for statehood for 
tennessee michigan california minnesota oregon and alaska 
perpich has served as governor of minnesota for 10 years he was 
appointed to finish the last two years of former gov wendell 
andersons term in 1978 and then won election to the office in 1982 
hatch has mounted a strong challenge this year focusing on 
scandals involving two close perpich associates and a perception 
that minnesotans are looking for a change 
after eight years past mistakes and personal vanities become 
the focus of an administration said hatch 
perpich countered by telling minnesotans they were living in the 
best state in the nation 
there isnt a state thats better than we are he said 
during a televised debate with hatch in 1983 we couldnt 
compete with south dakota today were beating the world 
the governor also scored a late spring coup when soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev paid a oneday visit to the state 
after his june summit with president bush 
a midaugust poll showed perpich and hatch were in a dead heat 
among members of the democraticfarmerlabor party the states 
equivalent of the democratic party 
but a survey published wednesday said perpich had opened a 
17point lead over hatch 
an unusual race also is taking place for the gop nomination for 
governor of minnesota state auditor arne carlson had an 18point 
lead in the latest poll over jon grunseth a st paul businessman 
who was endorsed by the state party 
party leaders attacked carlson as out of step with their 
positions on crime gun control and abortion the attacks abated 
only after a backlash from contributors who threatened to withhold 
funds 
in the democratic senate primary college professor paul 
wellstone and state agriculture commissioner jim nichols are 
competing for the nomination to oppose gop sen rudy boschwitz 
millionaire developer fife symington is the frontrunner for the 
republican nomination for governor of arizona but no one is 
prepared to write off mechams chances to capture the nomination in 
the fivecandidate field particularly if there is a low turnout 
the 66yearold former car dealer was elected governor in 1986 
and impeached and removed from office two years later on the basis 
of allegations he misused funds from supporters and interfered with 
the police investigation of an alleged death threat by one of his 
aides 
but the impeachment charges generated less controversy than many 
of mechams positions as governor particularly his opposition to a 
state holiday commemorating the birth of the rev martin luther 
king jr 
in the democratic primary for governor former mayor terry 
goddard of phoenix has only token opposition 
three democrats are battling in rhode island to challenge 
republican gov edward diprete whose approval rating in a brown 
university poll dipped below 20 percent 
mayors joseph r paolino jr of providence and francis x 
flaherty of warwick and businessman bruce g sundlun are in a close 
democratic race 
diprete first elected governor in 1984 is heavily favored over 
talk show host steve white in the gop primary 
in vermont gov madeleine kunin a democrat is retiring after 
three twoyear terms kunin was elected governor after republican 
richard snelling decided not to seek reelection in 1984 to a fifth 
term 
now its snellings turn and he is running to succeed kunin 
both snelling and democrat peter welch face only token opposition 
in their party primaries 
in neighboring new hampshire voters in both parties have plenty 
of choices 
former sen john durkin a democrat who lost his seat to warren 
rudman in 1980 is attempting a comeback in a crowded primary also 
competing for the democratic nomination to succeed retiring gop 
sen gordon humphrey are nashua mayor james donchess and 
businessman john rauh 
in the gop primary rep bob smith is favored over thomas 
christo who has complained that white house chief of staff john 
sununu a former new hampshire governor has intervened on behalf 
of smith 
in the new hampshire governors race former state democratic 
party chairman joseph grandmaison is favored to win his partys 
nomination to challenge republican gov judd gregg 
the biggest issue in the campaign for the republican nomination 
for governor of maryland has been whether frontrunner william 
shepard acted properly when he designated his wife lois as his 
candidate for lieutenant governor that move prompted ross z 
pierpont to launch his fourth campaign for governor 
whoever wins will have a formidable task challenging incumbent 
democratic gov william donald schaefer heavily favored for 
renomination 
two republican congressional primaries hold the interest in 
utah in the second district former rep dan marriott and 
geologist genevieve atwood are competing for the nomination to 
challenge democratic rep wayne owens 
in the heavily republican third district rep howard nielson is 
retiring and former state sen karl snow and thinktank chairman

troops tanks and planes remain poised at the line in the 
sand drawn by president bush in the gulf crisis both sides have 
held their fire but another struggle has been taking place in the 
form of a public relations war complete with communiques 
satellite tv and news conferences 
how good a job has the us news media done in sorting it all 
out the associated press checked with six specialists for their

there is a tendency for the story of this crisis to follow two 
tracks one a story of global political intrigue another a moral 
tale of right and wrong of hero and villain either course 
obscures the fact that the presence of american troops in saudi 
arabia and of course iraqi troops in kuwait is essentially an 
economic story at issue is the worlds oil supply and not least 
the united states 
the media try to map out the issues to explain who the parties 
are and what they are saying to assay interests and motivations 
but the press soon goes beyond the story of global politics 
to the people on the ground the naval and military personnel who 
ultimately fight a war if there is to be one while 
wellintentioned this coverage sometimes serves only to trivialize 
the larger issues 
at the same time however some of that coverage leads us to 
question precisely what and who we are fighting for and whether the 
price of american lives is worth paying recently some journalists 
have begun to probe at these points but if previous conflicts are 
any guide the larger prospect for the press is not encouraging

good journalism is supposed to show at least two sides of an 
issue but coverage of the gulf crisis has been very onesided 
us news media have allowed bush supporters to virtually drown out 
articulate critics of his persian gulf policy 
instead of asking tough questions weve seen too much media 
cheerleading and saberrattling on behalf of the president 
supposedly neutral reporting has often given way to worshipful 
prose about the masterful leadership of the commanderinchief 
reporters ought to be raising the real issues doesnt bushs 
rhetoric about saddam controlling the oilfields ring hollow 
when opec in cahoots with western oil companies would continue to 
fix prices is it worth risking 10000 american lives for the emir 
of kuwait who owns nearly as many wives as imelda marcos has 
shoes should us soldiers be deployed in support of the 
antidemocratic saudi regime which tortures its own people 
amid all the talk about saddam husseins naked aggression 
and trampling of international law media pundits have rarely 
uttered the p word panama bushs invasion violated 
international law just as much as saddams invasion but one would 
never know that from the us media

i think weve been having a difficult time in reaching the 
public with the longevity of this commitment we havent been too 
careful about explaining what seems to be a long period of 
continued western presence in a fairly hostile environment if 
there is anything remiss it may be that 
i dont think criticism of excess coverage of saddam is 
founded it is imperative to know thine enemy if you want to put 
it on a strictly partisan basis its a matter of degree there 
comes a time when the seventh interview of saddam hussein becomes 
suspect 
we are now trying to figure out how did we get there there 
has been some exposition of the roots of this thing the historical 
problems that beset kuwait and its relations to iraq we havent 
looked into this as much as we should 
the hostages invariably take over the news and they become what 
i imagine what saddam hussein wants them to become one of the 
primary issues the administration has been forced to do its utmost 
to downplay the hostages

beginning in 1930 with 3 million from 
the rockefeller foundation and a small ship called atlantis 
scientists began exploring the ocean from this tiny seaport at one 
corner of cape cod 
since then oceanographers from woods hole oceanographic 
institution have discovered vast underwater mountain ranges 
strange life forms in the galapagos islands hot water springs 
miles beneath the ocean surface and even the rms titanic 
even the movie jaws featured richard dreyfuss as a scientist 
from woods hole called in for his expertise on the great white 
shark 
indeed after 60 years of exhaustive research experimentation 
and technology scientists at woods hole can say this with pride 
men have now seen 1 percent of the ocean floor 
one percent this from a nation that sent men to the moon two 
decades ago scientists at woods hole will tell you that time and 
money would be better spent here 
its much more important that we use the tremendous technology 
we have to understand ourselves said john steele a senior 
scientist at woods hole and former director of the institution 
we have major scientific problems as well as social concerns here 
on earth 
the success of the scientists at woods hole is remarkable given 
the lack of glamour attached to oceanography and the scarcity of 
funds available for research 
the government spends about 390 million in oceanographic 
research annually in contrast president bush proposed this year a 
152 billion space agency budget 
perhaps we arent as good at selling ourselves as nasa said 
steele but we also all had even scientists the mistaken belief 
that the bottom of the ocean was flat and uninteresting 
without the capabilities of woods hole and other institutions 
we wouldnt understand the gulf stream and why its important to 
problems of climate we wouldnt have made wonderful discoveries 
under the sea bed and we wouldnt have appreciated the marine life 
in the deep ocean 
it can be as tricky to send scientists down to the oceans 
average depth of 12000 feet as it is to send astronauts into 
space the incredible pressure and the absence of light make the 
construction of underwater vehicles and other technology laborious 
and expensive 
but the marine biologists geologists engineers divers 
technicians chemists physicists and many others who comprise the 
900 employees at woods hole believe many of the solutions to the 
worlds environmental crisis may lie beneath the ocean surface 
woods hole is the largest private oceanographic institute in the 
world and relies mostly on grants about 80 percent of them from 
the federal government unlike its west coast counterpart the 
state universityaffiliated scripps institute in la jolla calif 
woods hole does not receive state money it has an operating budget 
of 67 million a year 
as a result woods hole scientists have been likened to 
entrepreneurs each in charge of their own destiny and relying on 
their creativity and vision to come up with successful grant 
proposals 
among the 350 projects at woods hole one of the most eagerly 
anticipated is the world ocean circulation experiment a global 
study of sea patterns the 10year 100 million project will track 
how the ocean influences climate over periods longer than weather 
forecasts of a few weeks 
scientists from the soviet union china brazil britain 
france spain and australia among others are part of the project 
they began gathering at woods hole more than three years ago to map 
the project 
the ocean plays a significant role in determining the impact 
of the greenhouse effect said terrence joyce a senior scientist 
at woods hole who is directing the hydrographic program for the 
world ocean circulation experiment woce will give us an idea of 
how the ocean affects climate change and allow us to better predict 
the future 
woods hole or whoi pronounced hooey by local residents and 
employees has been on the cutting edge of oceanography and marine 
science since its inception it was founded following a 
recommendation of the national academy of sciences that an american 
oceanographic lab was needed on the east coast 
the sprawling campus of woods hole dominates the small town 
which extends like a little finger off the southwestern corner of 
cape cod the large brick buildings of woods hole line the 
villages main street with water on both sides 
the campus consists of four large laboratories and a variety of 
smaller buildings in the village of woods hole and on the nearby 
200acre quissett campus the institution offers a graduate degree 
program for future oceanographers with the massachusetts institute 
of technology 
work at sea is conducted aboard three large research vessels a 
smaller coastal vessel and the alvin a threeperson deepwater 
submersible 
during world war ii woods hole researchers developed 
antifouling paint which prevented barnacles from forming on the 
hulls of boats and the bathythermograph an instrument that gives 
a record of temperature layers in the ocean 
since 1964 scientists at woods hole have been able to penetrate 
the ocean frontier with the aid of alvin which has made more than 
2000 dives all over the world and can go as deep as 13000 feet 
alvins most dramatic early mission was reminiscent of the film 
dr strangelove in 1966 two military planes collided over 
spain and a hydrogen bomb fell into the mediterranean alvin pilots 
found the device and then relocated it after it slipped down a 
steep slope during a recovery attempt 
in 1974 alvin joined project famous a frenchamerican undersea 
study and collected the firstever photographs and samples of the 
midatlantic ridge 
woods hole has a celebrity scientist robert ballard who 
discovered the wreck of the titanic in 1985 ballard discovered the 
german battleship bismarck last year he also is host of the pbss 
national geographic explorer tv series 
woods hole tends to support highrisk people more than a 
public institution would said ballard its very comparable to 
private industry versus the government theres a greater risk if 
you fail but it lets you try

an outbreak of salmonella in raw tomatoes in the 
midwest points up the need to take precautions to clean all food 
properly 
in the last two months more than 100 people have been reported 
stricken with salmonella javiana in illinois minnesota wisconsin 
and michigan 
it was the numbers that got officials attention normally in 
illinois for example officials would expect 20 cases of this 
strain of salmonella among 2000 to 3000 cases of salmonella a 
year 
the exact source of the tomato contamination has yet to be 
solved but it appears the problem stemmed from one distributor 
said minnesota state epidemiologist mike osterholm the 
contamination he said could have occurred anywhere from the 
fields to the trucking operation 
we have no evidence of anything intentional happening or of 
any breaks in good harvesting practices he said and it 
occurred at a time when millions of tomatoes were coming into the 
midwest we really are looking at a needle in a haystack 
osterholm estimated that thousands of people were made ill by 
the contaminated tomatoes only a small percentage of cases of such 
outbreaks generally get reported to state authorities he said 
though people commonly think of salmonella in relation to animal 
products strains of it have turned up and caused large outbreaks 
traced to lettuce and parsley cantalopes and other plant foods 
the symptoms vomiting diarrhea and stomach cramps are the 
same for salmonella javiana and the betterknown salmonella 
enteritidis said dr david swerdlow a medical epidemiologist with 
the centers for disease control 
there are hundreds of salmonella strains some are more common 
than others but most cause similar disease he said javiana 
is fairly rare so when there was increase in these states 
everybody took notice 
recent outbreaks of food poisoning osterholm said are a result 
of changes in food distribution large quantities of food moving 
over a widespread area 
i have great concern about the safety of the food suyppy 
today he said it is a lot less safe today than 10 to 15 years 
ago 
some precautions that can be taken at home 
wash fruit and vegetables i think it was impressive to us 
how few people knew they should wash produce osterholm said 
for tomatoes and other fruit cut off the stem area and then 
cut out any bruises or bad spots wash the knife between each cut 
to prevent any bacteria from spreading into the tomato flesh the 
salmonella outbreak traced to cantalopes occurred because the 
bacteria on the rind was carried by knives to the fruit 
after the fruit has been cut dont leave it for long at room 
temperature 
thoroughly wash any cutting boards used for meat before 
putting produce on them better yet use separate boards

it began in a renovated elevator factory where 
customers were drawn by dishes and utensils stacked devilmaycare 
in the crates and barrels they came in 
that rustic presentation gave the first crateampbarrel store a 
formula for success showing off mundane household products with 
the flair and imagination many stores reserve for designer garments 
the notion has brought the company from that single store in 
1962 to more than 30 in six states with a new flagship showroom to 
open thursday on chicagos glitzy magnificent mile 
crateampbarrel does for its housewares what most apparel stores 
do for their clothing lines they dress up their products so that a 
customer can look at a set of tableware and envision what their 
table at home could look like just like they would with an outfit 
of clothing said george rosenbaum president of the retail 
research firm leo j shapiro amp associates in chicago 
the flagship store is another expression of crateampbarrels 
trademark showmanship offering display cases with dressers and 
chairs along chicagos ritziest retail strip 
it all began when gordon and carole segal then both 23 were 
washing the dishes one day in 1962 
mr segal wondered why he couldnt get the couples favorite 
dishware in chicago and they decided there was a gap in the local 
market 
they quit their jobs his in real estate hers in teaching 
raised 17000 and set out to fill the gap with the first 
crateampbarrel 
it was all created out of a desire to be different said mr 
segal president and owner of the store chain 
it operates under the corporate name euromarket designs inc 
based in the chicago suburb of northbrook mrs segal pulled away 
to start her own catering business and has since retired 
when they started the usual places to stock ones kitchen and 
dining room were department stores where the goods often were 
warehoused in unobtrusive places mr segal said 
it was really a dreadful part of the store he said it 
was always hidden away on the top floor 
retail analysts and experts say crateampbarrel brought a new 
strategy to the housewares business by giving as much attention to 
the overall look of the store as to the types of goods it sells 
crateampbarrel has always been considered innovative in terms of 
color and style of their housewares and especially in the way they 
display them said kimberly rawn spokeswoman for the 
chicagobased national housewares manufacturers association 
mr segal describes his company as a blend of artists and 
businessmen 
its a fine line he said we dont want to be an art 
gallery but at the same time we dont want to just look at the 
bottom line 
the privately owned company declines to release details of its 
finances or operations except to say its staff has grown from 
three to about 1000 employees 
it has reported sales of about 15 million from its catalog 
business alone and mr segal said it taps the lucrative wedding 
market with a bridal registry listing an average 18000 brides at 
any given time 
crateampbarrel stores are found in illinois california texas 
maine massachusetts minnesota and washington dc 
about 75 percent of the housewares sold in the stores are 
imported and the stores purchasers arent bound by the consumer 
preference studies many department stores rely on mr segal said 
if we dont like it if we think its ugly were not going to 
buy it he said just because bloomingdales sold 2000 of 
these lamps doesnt mean were going to rush to sell them too 
he acknowledges not having stockholders allows him more freedom 
to veer from the norm and take risks instead of relying on market 
tests 
hes not under pressure to increase business or cut corners in 
order to keep earnings up rosenbaum said so he has the luxury 
of moving slowly and trying new things

texas oilman t boone pickens turns up the 
rhetoric in his personal trade war with japans koito manufacturing 
co today with fullpage advertisements in new york and washington 
pickens lambastes trade policies in japan which he said is 
even refusing to fully support americas military efforts in the 
middle east 
pickens known for his often hostile raids on us companies 
has been battling with the management of koito for 18 months to 
gain representation on its board of directors 
pickens claims his battle with koito an automobile parts 
manufacturer is an example of japans closed corporate system 
which the ads claim is unfair to competition 
the ads slated to appear in the new york times and the 
washington post said the japanese refuse to play on a level 
playing field causing the loss of american jobs and a growing us 
trade imbalance now japan is even refusing to fully support 
americas military efforts in the middle east where japan gets all 
of its oil to fuel its economic machine 
koito issued a statement that branded pickens tactics 
outrageous and irresponsible 
pickens has maintained that koito is really a subsidiary in an 
alleged cartel headed by toyota motor corp the japanese carmaker 
which is koitos largest customer pickens whose boone co owns 26 
percent of koitos stock claims toyota has three seats on the 
koito board while controlling only 19 percent of the car parts 
makers stock 
but ruth pachman a koito spokeswoman in new york said toyota 
has no representatives on the board although three former toyota 
employees are board members 
koito in turn has maintained pickens is really fronting for a 
japanese investor kitaro wantanabe who is allegedly seeking to 
mount a greenmail campaign in which a corporate raider buys a 
companys stock forcing it to buy the shares back at abovemarket 
prices 
pickens has denied the allegation but also refuses to disclose 
the source of his financing to obtain his stake in koito 
the texan was again denied a seat on koitos board at a raucous 
companys shareholders march meeting in tokyo 
koito said pickens was trying to manipulate public opinion for 
his own personal gain he continues to wrap his greenmailing 
schemes in the mantle of usjapan trade relations these tactics 
are outrageous and irresponsible 
japan which consumes 49 millions barrels of oil per day 34 
million barrels of it from the persian gulf has pledged 1 
billion in aid for the multinational force opposing iraqi troops 
that invaded kuwait last month 
but kuwait and the united states have urged japan to do more 
prime minister toshiki kaifu has ruled out any direct role for 
japans military citing the constitutional ban against using force 
in settling international disputes 
a japanese foreign ministry spokesman said wednesday that 
corporations there will be asked to divert exisiting stock to the 
aid package and sell their products to the government at cost 
mark helmke a pickens spokesman in washington said the ads 
which urge readers to complain to the white house congress and the 
japanese embassy about japanese trade policies will run in other 
newspapers around the country at a later date

the 10 major car and truck makers in the united states said 
wednesday they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 38943 
during the aug 2131 period this year that compared with a 49276 
vehicleaday rate during the same time last year when incentives 
lured buyers to showrooms

sales of cars made by general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp were down 27 percent during the period while sales

august car sales were down 176 percent and truck sales fell 157 
percent 
webb rewey chrysler spokesman tom jakowboski and gm marketing 
vice president jb fitzpatrick agreed that a general softening of 
the economy was more of a reason for the declining vehicle sales 
rate 
while present business conditions have created some 
uncertainty in the marketplace we are optimistic that the 
environment will continue to stabilize in the weeks ahead 
fitzpatrick said 
through the first eight months of this year car and truck sales 
from domestic and overseas automakers were 6 percent behind last 
years pace car sales were down 64 percent and truck sales were 
off 5 percent

import car sales were off 78 percent sales of trucks made in 
north america were down 27 percent and import truck sales were

treasury secretary nicholas brady on 
a globetrotting search for billions of dollars to support the 
campaign against iraqs saddam hussein arrived in asia today for 
what promises to be the toughest selling job of the whole trip 
brady is scheduled to meet friday with south korean president 
roh taewoo later the same day he flies to tokyo for talks with 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
the bush administration also dispatched secretary of state james 
a baker iii to oilrich nations of the middle east to look for 
economic support 
officials in the delegation traveling with brady said the stops 
in south korea and japan were likely to be the most difficult in 
part because americans were looking for substantial contributions 
from both countries to defray the cost of the us military buildup 
and to help ease the economic hardships on jordan and other nations 
resulting from the trade embargo on iraq 
critics in the united states have complained that both japan and 
south korea should be doing more given the fact that their 
economies are heavily dependent on oil from the middle east 
a working dinner at the us ambassadors residence was the only 
event on bradys schedule before his meeting friday morning with 
the south korean president 
these discussions were to follow on the heels of bradys talks 
tuesday and wednesday with french officials and british prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
but in those cases the meetings involved countries which 
already have a sizable military presence in the persian gulf and 
have indicated a willingness to provide at least some aid to 
alleviate the economic suffering on egypt jordan and turkey from 
enforcement of the trade embargo against iraq 
japan and south korea have been less forthcoming in the eyes of 
the administration and for that reason bradys delegation was 
braced for tougher negotiations 
during bradys 17hour flight from europe to the far east 
senior administration officials said a 1 billion military support 
package offered by japan represented a good first step but they 
left the clear impression that tokyo would be called on to do more 
the officials who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
said there was no thought of asking south korea to supply military 
troops in the middle east but they suggested seoul would be asked 
to make inkind contributions to support the american buildup 
the administration officials also supplied some of the first 
specific figures on what president bush had in mind when he called 
on americas allies to pay their fair share of the economic and 
military campaign being waged to force iraq to withdraw from kuwait 
the officials said the united states is looking for its allies 
to pick up the entire cost of the american military buildup in the 
persian gulf which they estimated would cost 1 billion a month 
over the next year 
i think it is not unreasonable to ask the allies to pick up 
all of it one official said after all they couldnt buy this 
military capability anywhere else in the world 
japans 1 billion has been earmarked to support the military 
exercise in such ways as sending medical personnel to the gulf 
the officials indicated that this type of inkind contributions 
of such things as oil transportation and housing would be the 
preferred donation rather than direct cash which raises questions 
among critics over whether the us military is fielding a 
mercenary force in the mideast 
secretary of state baker meanwhile flew to the middle east 
overnight in his search for economic support the administration is 
hoping to get significant amounts from saudi arabia the united 
arab emirates and the exiled government of kuwait which still has 
significant financial resources at its disposal 
in addition to looking for support for the us military effort 
brady and baker were searching for a 105 billion pool of 
resources to assist egypt jordan and turkey three countries 
severely hurt by the trade embargo against iraq 
senior officials traveling on bradys plane put the relief need 
for the three countries at 35 billion for the last three months 
of this year and 7 billion more next year 
in his meetings in europe brady has stressed how critical it is 
for the allies to put together an economic assistance package to 
insure that the embargo against iraq doesnt begin to unravel 
the conversations with mrs thatcher and the french centered 
primarily on this issue of support for socalled frontline states 
in the mideast 
in addition to this aid the administration wants to raise an 
unspecified amount to be used to alleviate adverse economic effects 
from rising oil prices on countries such as the philippines brazil 
and the emerging democracies of eastern europe 
the officials would not discuss an overall price tag but the 
various elements could well add up to more than 25 billion

unlawful trading 
but the government didnt agree to recommend any specific

maximum sentence on those charges of 28 years 
the report said the witnesses could include ivan boesky the 
convicted former stock trader 
the story said the judge isnt obligated to take the 
governments additional allegations into consideration when 
deciding an appropriate sentence but if she does the story said 
milken will be entitled to defend himself at a hearing 
the story said prosecutors have held lengthy discussions with 
attorneys for milken in recent months detailing what they plan to 
say in their sentencing memo to the judge who is scheduled to 
receive it on monday 
in addition the story said witnesses who aided the government 
in its case against milken have confirmed that they were told by 
prosecutors that the government will seek to present the full force 
of its case against milken at any such hearing 
prosecutors have told these attorneys that such a hearing could 
last for more than three months the story said

bertelsmann ag the west german media 
conglomerate has ended an eightmonth search for a new boss of 
bantam doubleday dell on by naming paul d neuthaler as chairman 
and chief executive 
the publishing group had been without a permanent leader since 
alberto vitale left to take over random house at the start of the 
year 
officials of the parent company said wednesday that the search 
was prolonged by the difficulty of finding an executive with 
credentials in both books and finance the new york times reported 
thursday 
the choice of neuthaler a relative unknown appeared to be 
connected with bertelsmanns desire to push into scientific 
technical and professional publishing in the united states 
neuthaler 47 had directed a fruitless effort by the company in 
the middle 1980s to develop a technical publishing arm in this 
country 
he then left to become a partner of jpt publishing group 
financial scientific and market research publishers 
bantam doubleday dell is a generalinterest or trade 
publishing group for which bertelsmann paid 475 million three 
years ago 
bernhard von minckwitz a bertelsmann board member who had been 
acting chief executive during the search for a new chairman will 
remain with the group with the new title of executive chairman and 
neuthaler will report to him bertelsmann said

a federal judge today denied the 
governments request for a stay of his order requiring the office 
of thrift supervision to return control of franklin savings 
association to its former officers 
the denial by judge dale e saffels sent government attorneys to 
the 10th us circuit court in denver seeking to override saffels 
and get an order that would keep franklin under federal management 
the government was fighting a deadline saffels set wednesday for 
turning franklin over to its former managers 
franklins chief counsel roger stanton said the savings 
association had its attorneys ready in denver to file a response 
opposing a similar motion there he said 10th circuit rules do not 
provide for a hearing on such a motion 
ots seized control of franklin based in ottawa kan and the 
states largest thrift last february in a dispute over whether it 
was being managed prudently it placed franklin under management of 
the resolution trust corp as conservator 
franklins officers sued to regain control of the thrift and 
saffels held in a 93page opinion made public wednesday that the 
government seizure was arbitrary and capricious 
he ordered the government to remove the rtc as conservator of 
franklin and to turn over management reins today to the thrifts 
chairman ernest w fleischer 
however ots attorneys filed a motion wednesday night for a stay 
of judgment seeking to keep franklin in the hands of the rtc while 
the government appeals saffels decision 
saffels said the ots has not demonstrated either a strong 
likelihood of success on the merits on appeal or that it would 
suffer irreparable harm if a stay were not issued 
the judge ruling on the stay motion without a hearing said a 
stay would be contrary to the public interest 
harris weinstein chief ots counsel in washington said late 
wednesday the federal agency would appeal to the 10th circuit 
seeking a stay if saffels denied its motion 
in his order saffels found that the ots decision to take 
control of franklin lacked any basis in fact 
weinstein disagreed strongly 
we firmly believe the government acted in a timely and proper 
manner in taking over franklin an institution that was being 
operated with insufficient capital and in an unsafe and unsound 
manner weinstein said in a statement issued in washington 
ots continues to believe that prior to the conservatorship 
order franklin was placing excessive reliance on highrisk assets 
financed by highcost and mobile brokered deposits and that at the 
same time franklin used improper accounting methods under which it 
recognized gains and deferred losses while distributing more than 
45 million of the institutions funds in dividends to the 
shareholders 
saffels also retained jurisdiction in the case for the next 90 
days meaning that the ots cannot appoint another conservator or 
attempt to place franklin in receivership during that time without 
his approval 
saffels told reporters that after 90 days the ots could move 
against franklin again that could mean more court hearings he 
said and wed probably start over again 
the ruling was not expected to have any direct impact on other 
savings and loan litigation 
at issue in this case was whether ots was justified in seizing 
control of the 11 billion thrift on feb 16 for allegedly losing 
millions in the futures market but deferring those losses for 
bookkeeping purposes by using a controversial hedging accounting 
system 
franklin officials headed by fleischer sued the government on 
march 12 contending the government had insufficient evidence of 
losses management problems or improper accounting procedures to 
take over the thrift 
saffels declared in his lengthy opinion that no statutory 
ground for the imposition of a conservatorship existed 
this was not a case of improper or retroactive rulemaking 
but one of erroneous application of existing regulatory rules he 
wrote the facts of this case clearly show that the regulator 
acted wrongly in imposing the conservatorship this court must 
correct that wrongful action 
the judge went out of his way to distinguish the franklin case 
from others being prosecuted around the country by ots 
this is not a case involving an infamous or notorious savings 
and loan association the likes of which the public has recently 
become more than familiar saffels wrote 
this is not a case involving fraud corruption or selfdealing 
by the management or directors of franklin there has been no 
allegation or even hint of illegal or unethical conduct by 
franklins management or directors 
essentially this case boils down to a dispute over accounting 
practices he wrote 
fleischer who was in saffels courtroom when the ruling was 
released said he was very pleased with the decision and the care 
with which the decision was written

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher thursday on the chicago board of trade amid expectations of 
more sales of us grain to the soviet union 
the soybean market drew further support from reports that hot 
dry weather has begun to stress soybeans in nebraska as well as in 
the mississippi delta region which has been unusually dry all 
summer analysts said 
speculation continued to mount that the united states will grant 
credit to the soviet union for purchases of agricultural 
commodities said william biedermann director of research with 
allendale inc a futures brokerage in crystal lake ill 
it could be as soon as monday or tuesday biedermann said 
but i dont think the important thing is when the important 
thing is that they are going to get it 
he said there were also signs that soviet grain production this 
year will fall below market expectations 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cents to 3 cents higher 
with the contract for delivery in september at 266 a bushel

frequent fliers want to get where theyre going 
cheaply and on time nothing bugs them like delays and in general 
theyre pretty unhappy with airline service 
so says the 1990 zagat airline survey which reflects the 
opinions of 4462 upscale business travelers who spend nearly one 
night a week on the road results were released at a new york news 
conference thursday 
many view the airlines and airports as akin to the buses and 
bus terminals of 20 years ago deteriorating overcrowded 
disappearing and depressing said survey analyst nicholas 
tortorello 
the survey was a first for tim and nina zagat the husband and 
wife team known for their annual assessment of hotels and 
restaurants they said they took on the airline industry to 
explore the publics feelings about air travel 
questionnaires were sent to 25000 people this spring asking 
them to rate 1400 us hotels restaurants spas car rental 
companies and airlines 
respondents were asked to rate 27 top international and domestic 
carriers in terms of comfort service timeliness food and bang 
for buck which rated cost and value scores were then averaged 
together for an overall rating 
the top 10 spots went to international carriers with singapore 
airlines heading the list with an overall rating of 2514 followed 
by swissair japan air lines scandinavian airlines system and 
qantas 
american airlines ranked 11th with an 1862 rating delta air 
lines the next domestic airline on the list was 14th at 1812 
aeroflot soviet airline came in last scoring a dismal 731 
according to the 30point scale 26 to 30 signifies a rating of 
extraordinary to perfection 20 to 25 very good to excellent 10 
to 19 good to very good and zero to nine poor to fair 
tortorello whose firm research amp forecasts analyzed the survey 
results said foreign carriers scored better overall than domestics 
because airlines use bigger more comfortable planes on longer 
flights and the crew has more time to pamper passengers 
domestic airlines fared better when respondents listed their 
favorite airlines capturing six of the top 10 spots american 
topped that list with 229 percent choosing it as their favorite 
the other top domestics were united delta trans world 
continental and pan american world airways 
the survey also separated the airlines into domestic and 
international categories american delta and united airlines 
respectively captured the top three domestic spots while troubled 
eastern airlines ranked last in 11th 
karen cerensak a spokeswoman for eastern defended the 
carriers recent performance saying some of these people 
obviously have not flown eastern recently in the last 18 months 
weve been on top in the industry for on time performance weve 
received food awards for our inflight meals and our fares are 
among the lowest in the industry so the perception thats out 
there does not match reality 
internationally singapore swissair and japan air lines headed 
the list while el al israel airlines olympic airways and aeroflot 
were listed at the bottom in 14th 15th and 16th places 
in a section that included comments travelers generally had 
good and bad things to say about each carrier with the exception 
of aeroflot that airline was called a flying slum by one flyer 
and included this warning from another dont do it 
the survey also found that of eight features travelers consider 
in choosing an airline the most important were routes offered 46 
percent price 42 percent and timeliness and reliability 41 
percent 
quality of food 12 percent was least important 
tortorello says he believes the low figure reflects passengers 
resignation that nothing can be done about the taste or selection 
of the food 
travelers biggest gripe were delays 496 percent followed by 
comfort 165 percent and service 95 percent 
surprisingly safety was at the bottom of the list 16 percent 
and oftheard complaints about baggage were cited by only 33 
percent of the respondents 
tortorello said safety ranked so low because a majority of the 
travelers apparently believe every airline is trying to do its 
best 
he said women rated safety as a concern more often than men and 
women were also more concerned about price men basically seemed 
more concerned about the plane being on time and comfort 
tortorello said 
the collective profile of those who responded to the 
questionnaire showed they were mostly upscale professionals between 
the ages of 30 and 59 who spend an average of nearly one night a 
week on the road 
fiftynine percent of the respondents were men and 37 percent 
women four percent did not identify themselves by sex 
the margin of error could not be scientifically calculated 
because the survey was not a random sampling 
cornish hitchcock of the nonprofit watchdog group aviation 
consumer action project said the zagat survey will be a useful 
tool in helping consumers choose airlines and hopefully will 
serve as another goad to those airlines who are not doing such 
a good job to improve their performance

the iraqi invasion of kuwait last month has 
put on hold efforts by the resolution trust corp to sell the 
phoenician resort in scottsdale to a branch of the kuwait 
government 
for months the rtc the federal agency established to oversee 
the sale of failed savings and loan associations had been 
negotiating with the kuwait investment office in london on the sale 
of the 260 milliondollar phoenician resort 
thats all on hold until the middle east situation clears 
up said kevin shields rtc spokesman in denver 
the kuwaiti office has the right of first refusal for purchasing 
the phoenician because it owns 45 percent of it and the crescent 
another hotel in phoenix 
the rtc obtained the remaining 55 percent interest in the hotels 
in 1989 when federal regulators seized the failing lincoln savings 
amp loan association which operated the hotels as subsidiaries 
lincoln was a unit of american continental corp of phoenix of 
which financier charles h keating jr was chairman he resigned 
aug 24 
selling the hotels already had been delayed because of the 
litigation surrounding keating as well as an 185 million lawsuit 
filed by mccarthy western constructors prime contractor for the 
phoenician mccarthy says it is owed that much for work it did at 
the hotel but was not paid 
that lawsuit was close to being settled but mark nadeau a 
phoenix attorney representing the hotels for the rtc said the 
persian gulf crisis complicates the situation because some kuwaiti 
money would be needed to pay for the settlement 
after iraq seized kuwait several governments including those 
of the united states england and france froze kuwaiti investments 
and assets in their countries to protect them from the iraqis 
the kuwaiti office is one of several kuwaiti institutions set up 
to invest the massive oil profits kuwait had earned since 1973 
when the first arab oil embargo sent prices soaring 
the country now is believed to have about 100 billion in 
foreign assets and investments around the world including the 
phoenixarea hotels

atlantic richfield co introduced its second 
lesspolluting gasoline thursday a premium unleaded it said would 
burn cleaner and cost less than any competitors 
arco chairman lodwrick m cook said the fuel also will help 
prove his contention that cleaner gasolines not fuels such as 
methanol or natural gas are the best way to meet increasingly 
tough smogcontrol laws in southern california and other areas of 
heavy air pollution 
he said arco would absorb the extra costs of making the new gas 
known as ec for emission control premium rather than passing 
them along to dealers in higher wholesale prices making the gas 
will cost a few cents more per gallon what wed like to think is 
well sell more of it making up the lower margin in increased 
market share cook said 
arco currently has about 15 percent of the market for hightest 
gas in the five western states in which it sells gas he said 
the new gasoline with an octane rating 92 will be sold only in 
southern california for the time being it replaces arcos old 
hightest gasoline the 91 octane super unleaded 
arco became the first oil company with a lowemission gasoline 
in august 1989 when it introduced ec1 a substitute for the 
leaded regular used in old cars and trucks 
since then several other companies have begun selling fuels 
reformulated to evaporate less easily and burn cleaner many of 
those gasolines like arcos ecpremium are intended for newer 
cars that run on unleaded fuel examples include shell su 2000e 
chevron supreme unleaded and exxon plus 
arco said tests it conducted with state and regional airquality 
officials showed the new fuel would reduce emissions by 86000 
pounds per day its ec1 already has reduced vehicle air pollution 
by 73 million pounds arco said 
cook said it would cost arco about four cents a gallon more to 
make the new premium arco had raised wholesale prices for the old 
premium by a couple of cents a gallon before the persian gulf 
crisis and believes it can absorb the additional cost without 
undue damage to profits he said 
the key ingredient in the gas as in ec1 is the octanebooster 
methyl tertiary butyl ether or mtbe the oxygenrich mtbe is used 
to replace higher polluting octaneenhancers such as lead benzene 
or toluene 
its produced at arcos carson calif refinery and by arcos 
chemical affiliate assuring arco a regular supply a shortage of 
mtbe coupled with instability in energy markets caused chevron 
recently to postpone the introduction of its reformulated gas in 
houston baltimore and washington chevron already had begun 
selling the fuel in southern california 
cook said arcos new gas contains 15 percent mtbe compared to 
competitors 1 percent while polluting components have been 
reduced for example it contains just 1 percent benzene compared 
to 27 percent benzene in competitors fuels he said 
arco the nations eighthlargest oil company sells gas in 
california oregon washington arizona and nevada its strategy 
has been to offer the lowest pump prices something its 
accomplished by doing away with credit cards and nearly all 
fullservice pumps 
huge reserves of alaska crude have also helped that strategy 
and came in handy in assuring crude supply when president bush 
appealed to oil companies to restrain price increases after iraqs 
invasion of kuwait 
arco froze its wholesale gas prices for two weeks longer than 
any other company the move reaped goodwill from the public and 
politicians a bonanza the company clearly hopes to augment with 
its new fuels 
that response was clear at the news conference thursday as los 
angeles mayor tom bradley and regional smogcontrol officials 
praised cook as a farsighted smogfighter 
no oil company has yet introduced a lesspolluting substitute 
for regular unleaded gasoline by far the most commonly used grade 
and also the grade in which consumers are most costconscious 
in an interview thursday cook acknowledged that such a gas 
would inevitably mean higher pump prices 
he said arco wont market such a fuel until congress finalizes 
cleanair standards nationwide and all oil companies will have to 
market the gasolines 
it will be four or five years and a 2 billion investment 
before we can get close cook said 
that investment will have to be borne by the whole industry he 
said while arco was willing to shoulder several millions of 
dollars in development costs on a fuel like ecpremium we 
cant take a 2 billion hit all by ourselves

the dollar finished mostly lower in thin trading 
on the worlds currency markets thursday as speculation mounted 
over whether the federal reserve is poised to nudge interest rates 
lower 
the us currency took its biggest hit against the japanese yen 
falling to an 11month low and gave up significant ground against 
the british pound 
analysts said the markets attention is tuned to the labor 
departments release friday of unemployment statistics for august 
on the assumption that the federal reserve will respond by pushing 
interest rates lower to give the economy a boost 
the market consensus contends the report will show a gain of 
between 50000 to 65000 jobs on nonfarm payrolls but it is 
unclear whether a figure within that range would prompt the fed to 
take action 
the nations central bank is under considerable pressure to 
notch rates lower to avert a recession at the same time though 
lower interest rates could fan inflation as oil price continue to 
rise 
some speculate the fed will opt against easing because of the 
sagging dollar 
the dollar is too weak to ease now said earl johnson a 
vice president at chicagobased harris trust and savings bank the 
weaker the dollar the less incentive for foreigners to invest in 
dollardenominated securities 
foreign capital is critical to the financing of the nations 
budget deficit the united states has attracted foreign capital in 
the past by offering higher yields on government securities than 
those available elsewhere in the industrialized world but the 
interestrate advantage has been narrowed as yields in europe and 
japan have advanced recently 
analysts note that returns on shortterm instruments like 
threemonth treasury bills are simply not as alluring as they once 
were 
the pound meanwhile was bolstered by anticipation that britain 
will join the european exchange rate mechanism at a meeting of 
european finance ministers in rome this weekend the mechanism 
establishes currency rates for a basket of european community 
countries 
despite weeklong weakness in the japanese stock market the yen 
has continued to gain ground at the expense of the dollar and a 
number of continental currencies 
in tokyo the dollar fell to a closing 14165 japanese yen from 
14230 yen at wednesdays close later in london it fell further 
to 14105 yen in new york the dollar closed at 14065 yen down 
from 14165 yen on wednesday 
in london the british pound rose to 19075 from 18990 late 
wednesday in new york it cost 19125 to buy one pound more 
expensive than wednesdays 19055 
other late dollar rates in new york compared with late 
wednesdays rates included 15560 german marks down from 15580 
12975 swiss francs up from 12940 52135 french francs down

to return the thrift 
we waited for a couple minutes and then the order came in from 
office of thrift supervision director timothy ryan to return the 
thrift to us and thats what they did said john scowcroft 
president of franklins holding company 
but court action continued 
government attorneys filed a motion shortly after 11 am with 
the 10th us circuit court of appeals in denver asking for a stay 
in the judges order while the government appeals the ruling 
earlier thursday morning saffels had denied a similar request for 
a stay 
the appeals court had taken no action by afternoon 
roger stanton the lead attorney for franklin said he would be 
surprised if the appeals court granted a stay franklin considered 
the governments request moot because it was filed after 11 am 
he said 
scowcroft and fleische when he was 
befriended by perlasca 
ronai says he feels guilty that he never searched for perlasca 
after the war to thank him for the phony letters of protection 
he issued to jewish families or the scraps of food perlasca 
delivered to the starving inhabitants of jewish safe houses that 
flew the spanish flag 
at least he is alive and at last we are able to talk to each 
other ronai said 
from october 1944 until january 1945 when budapest was 
liberated by soviet troops perlasca masqueraded as a spanish 
diplomat and provided sanctuary for an estimated 5200 jews facing 
wholesale slaughter by hungarian nazi thugs 
he saw a jewish boys skull crushed by nazi rifle butts he 
rescued a naked girl from a massacre of hundreds of screaming jews 
who were marched out of the budapest ghetto shot to death and 
dumped into the danube river he confronted adolf eichmann during a 
train station tugofwar over young jewish twins and won their 
release 
stared down by an indignant and unyielding perlasca eichmann 
told his underlings let them go their time will come too 
eichmann who engineered nazi germanys wartime extermination of 
6 million european jews was seized by israeli agents in 1960 
convicted by a jerusalem court of crimes against humanity and 
hanged in 1962 
his time came too perlasca said 
incredibly two former gestapo officers knocked on perlascas 
door in padua before eichmann went on trial beseeching him to 
testify as a character witness for the defendant perlasca 
brusquely refused 
unlike wallenberg the celebrated swedish diplomat who saved 
tens of thousands of jews in budapest before he disappeared 
perlascas exploits were virtually unknown in the united states 
until very recently 
his name appeared occasionally in the italian and israeli press 
two years ago the yad vshem holocaust memorial in jerusalem 
hailed him as righteous among the nations of the world 
his story was discovered by miles lerman an executive of the 
us holocaust memorial council during a visit to budapest last 
fall 
the council is a federal agency overseeing construction of a 
privately financed 147 million holocaust museum near the national 
mall when it opens in april 1993 lerman said its exhibits will 
include the story of perlascas extraordinary acts of courage 
in this sea of darkness there were flickers of light from a 
few people lerman said there werent many who cared to step 
forward while other good people stood idly by and did nothing but 
their choices made the difference between life and death 
in the total darkness of cruelty and indifference they found 
that goodness has a power of its own and they became beacons of 
light who redeemed mankind he said 
perlasca speaks more modestly of his perilous feats 45 years 
ago when he was the hungarian representative of a romebased 
company that supplied meat to the italian army 
i always say the opportunity makes a thief perlasca said 
speaking through an interpreter my opportunity was there and i 
took it maybe those who remained silent didnt have the 
opportunity

oil prices soared over 30 a barrel thursday 
reaching that plateau for the second time since the persian gulf 
crisis as traders bet that supply shortages will develop 
light sweet crude rose throughout a hectic day of trading on the 
new york mercantile exchange closing up 166 at 3143 per barrel 
for october contracts at its peak thursday oil traded at 3158 
the us energy department testified yesterday to congress 
that they thought thered be a shortage of oil this winter said 
philip l dodge an analyst with nomura securities international 
inc that was enough to move the markets also theres no sign 
of peace breaking out in the gulf 
oil futures had last traded above 30 per barrel on aug 2224 
at one point matching the alltime merc high of 3235 before that 
surge the merc had not seen 30 crude since november 1985 
the stock market took a sharp dive thursday in the face of 
rising oil prices with the dow jones industrial average falling 
3193 points to 259629 
unleaded gasoline futures also traded higher up 28 cents to 
9507 cents per gallon for october delivery analysts partially 
attributed the increase to a realization that increased crude 
output by saudi arabia and venezuela will not accommodate most us 
refineries because it is a more difficult oil to refine 
even though those nations are exceeding temporarily their opec 
production limits to make up for the shortfall caused by the 
boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti oil petroleum experts fear that 
refinery capacity in kuwait cannot be replaced quickly 
gasoline is the item to worry about dodge said it was in 
relatively short supply going into the crisis also the oil that 
replaces the iraqi crude has a lower yield of gasoline the excess 
oil thats being made up by the saudis and the venezuelans is sour 
heavy crude which is not something the us refineries like to run 
through their systems 
domestic refinery operators prefer light sweet crude which has 
less sulfur and costs less to refine 
the petroleum markets opened strong on news that an american 
citizen had been shot in the hand by an iraqi police officer in 
kuwait the continued tensions in the middle east kept oil high all 
day 
prices were also bolstered by bullish markets in europe where 
tight supplies might cut us imports of heating oil said brendan 
dolan an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc 
thats helping to fuel the buying for crude right now 
dolan said 
home heating oil was up 487 cents to 8824 cents for october 
delivery natural gas for october closed at 1530 per 1000 cubic 
feet up from 1514 a day earlier 
later contract months for the petroleum futures were all higher 
with oil above 30 per barrel for november and december delivery 
although oils initial rise above 30 per barrel last month 
caught futures traders by surprise one expert said thursday there 
was no particular significance to the number 
thirty dollars is just a magical number as 25 was said 
thomas c lewis a vice president with duff amp phelps inc in 
chicago the next one will be 35

paramount communications inc is in the market 
for a merger or acquisition but has already passed on specific 
chances to invest in the theme park recorded music and publishing 
fields its chairman said thursday 
martin s davis who is also chief executive made the comments 
as paramount reported that earnings for its third quarter rose 103 
percent from a year ago improvement in paramounts publishing 
operations more than offset a decline in operating income from its 
entertainment business 
davis has indicated on several occasions that paramount is 
interested in making a purchase or arranging a merger in 
entertainment or publishing 
the company made a failed bid for time inc last year but 
subsequently raised a considerable amount of cash by selling its 
financial services arm associates corp of north america for 
335 billion last year 
nonetheless most analysts say they expect paramount is probably 
exploring relatively small strategic deals rather than large ones 
especially given the depressed condition of the stock market 
recently 
davis was quoted in a report thursday by dow jones news service 
as saying paramount continues to hold talks with a number of 
companies he declined to identify regarding a possible merger or 
acquisition 
we have looked at specific opportunities to invest in the 
theme park and recorded music businesses but we ultimately 
concluded that the opportunities presented could not achieve an 
acceptable return on our investment given the acquisition process 
and growth potential of the companies he was quoted 
but he said the company would explore other opportunities in 
these areas 
he also said acquisition candidates in publishing and 
information services were abandoned because the prices were too 
high 
jerry sherman a spokesman for paramount said davis was in 
meetings and unavailable for comment but said the account of 
davis remarks was accurate for the three months ended july 31 
paramount earned 1062 million or 88 cents a share compared with 
963 million or 80 cents a share a year ago 
revenue for the quarter rose 88 percent to 104 billion from 
951 million a year earlier 
the latest results include net interest income of 106 million 
mainly due to investment of proceeds from the associates sale the 
1989 results included net interest expense of 321 million a 
charge of 483 million related to paramounts unsuccessful bid for 
time inc and 778 million in earnings from the associates 
operating income from publishing rose 11 percent in the quarter 
to 1152 million as gains in educational and international 
publishing sales more than offset lower results from consumer 
publishing and a flat performance in professional information 
but the company said operating income from entertainment dropped 
4 percent in the quarter to 551 million as gains in television 
operations were more than offset by declines in motion picture and 
theater operations and costs associated with the renovation of 
madison square garden 
it noted that the bulk of the profits from domestic distribution 
of its summer blockbuster ghosts will be recorded in the fourth 
quarter 
for the first nine months of its fiscal year paramount said it 
earned 1486 million or 123 a share down 36 percent from 
2311 million or 193 a share a year earlier 
revenue for the nine months rose 112 percent to 269 billion 
from 242 billion a year earlier 
davis was also quoted as saying the company now expected to be 
at the lower end of its earlier forecast of full year earnings 
of 210 to 260 a share paramount earned 1221 a share in 
fiscal 1989 including a onetime gain of 1005 on the sale of the 
associates

the goodyear tire amp rubber co said thursday 
it will eliminate 1180 jobs in europe by mid1992 in an ongoing 
restructuring effort that has cut jobs in the united states and 
canada 
the company also announced it expects to incur an estimated 51 
million in aftertax charges in the third quarter to cover 
restructuring and environmental cleanup costs linked to production 
sites closed in 1986 
in a statement goodyear chairman tom h barrett predicted that 
competitive forces within the tire industry and higher costs tied 
to instability in the middle east create an atmosphere for a 
general economic downturn the rest of this year and in 1991 
barrett said goodyear will focus on containing costs while 
improving the efficiency of north american and european operations 
these measures are designed to strengthen our core businesses 
as we continue our focus on improving production efficiencies and 
the development of high quality products which meet the needs of 
our customers barrett said 
company spokesman walt mcclenny said the company has a european 
workforce of about 20000 
in july goodyear reported a loss of 94 million in the second 
quarter due to charges resulting from the restructuring of tire 
operations and the closing of a roofing systems plant 
the loss amounted to 16 cents per share for the quarter ended 
june 30 compared with a profit of 271 million or 47 cents per 
share a year ago sales in the quarter rose slightly to 287 
billion from 281 billion 
those results included a charge of 214 million or 37 cents a 
share due to restructuring 
in the first half goodyear earned 115 million or 20 cents 
per share on sales of 556 billion that compared with 1216 
million or 211 per share on sales of 545 billion in the first 
half of 1989 
citing sluggishness in the auto industry and concerns about 
inventory goodyear announced last week its plans to lay off 800 
employees at manufacturing plants in tennessee and quebec goodyear 
said aug 30 that the duration of the layoffs would depend on the 
economy and market demand 
valleyfield quebec has goodyears largest canadian plant the 
temporary layoffs of 530 workers follow goodyears recent 
announcement of plans to lay off 360 workers there by years end 
because the plant is discontinuing production of medium and 
heavyduty truck tires 
in june goodyear revealed a plan to eliminate 1100 jobs and 
take a 35 million charge in the second quarter as part of a 
restructuring of its us tire sales and support staff those job 
cuts were to be phased in through layoffs and early retirements

gold neared 390 an ounce thursday the third straight day of 
rising prices as the market continued its recovery from last weeks 
collapse 
but unlike last months explosive rally analysts said golds 
current strength appeared to reflect investor concerns about the 
economy rather than kneejerk reactions to persian gulf 
developments 
on other markets oil prices soared following reports that iraqi 
police shot an american civilian in the hand in occupied kuwait 
grains and soybeans advanced and livestock and meat futures were 
mostly higher 
gold futures settled 320 to 360 higher on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for spot delivery up 360 at 
38970 a troy ounce the heavily traded december contract settled 
at 39620 
silver futures settled 33 cents to 37 cents higher with 
september at 477 a troy ounce 
spot gold has climbed 740 an ounce this week after plunging 
3270 last week amid perceptions that the usiraq confrontation 
was cooling down 
heightened tensions in the gulf this week have provided support 
for gold but investors seem to be responding more to economic news 
especially inflation signals said stephen w platt an analyst who 
follows the precious metal and oil markets for dean witter reynolds 
inc 
gold is often considered an investment hedge against inflation 
federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan told the senate 
banking committee wednesday it could take several years to reduce 
the us inflation rate platt said that remark apparently sparked 
some of the demand for gold 
it appears that in this point in time the monetary 
authorities have given up on trying to contain inflationary 
pressures in the us economy and appear to be focusing on how to 
limit any kind of recessionary tendency that might be popping up 
he said 
oil prices rose sharply for the fifth straight day on the new 
york mercantile exchange as traders responded to the middle east 
developments and to wednesdays weekly american petroleum institute 
inventory report which showed a largerthanexpected drop last 
week in us supplies of crude oil 
light sweet crude oil futures settled 64 cents to 166 higher 
with october at 3143 a barrel heating oil was 185 cents to 487 
cents higher with october at 8824 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 275 cents to 338 cents higher with october at 9507 
cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures settled mostly higher on the chicago 
board of trade amid expectations of more sales of us grain to the 
soviet union 
the soybean market drew further support from reports that hot 
dry weather has begun to stress soybeans in nebraska as well as in 
the mississippi delta region which has been unusually dry all 
summer analysts said 
speculation continued to mount that the united states will grant 
credit to the soviet union for purchases of agricultural 
commodities said william biedermann director of research with 
allendale inc a futures brokerage in crystal lake ill 
wheat futures settled 1 cents to 2 cents higher with september 
at 265 a bushel corn was cent lower to 1 cents higher with 
september at 243 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher 
with september at 111 a bushel soybeans were cent lower to 5 
cents higher with september at 617 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange cattle futures were boosted 
by higher cash steer prices and active retail beef movement 
nearterm hog futures also advanced but the deferred contracts 
settled lower amid expectations that hog marketings will increase 
next week when cooler weather is expected in the midwest 
live cattle futures settled 03 cent to 55 cent higher with 
october at 7782 cents a pound feeder cattle were 02 cent lower 
to 30 cent higher with september at 87 cents a pound live hogs 
were 22 cent lower to 08 cent higher with october at 4935 cents

a federal judge thursday extended a freeze on 
payments to asbestos victims by the manville trust for one month to 
complete a restructuring plan for the fund 
us district judge jack b weinstein said more time was needed 
to work out the details of a court order to rehabilitate the 
finances of the trust which has run out of money to pay tens of 
thousands of new asbestos health claims 
it was the second monthlong extension by weinstein the freeze 
applies to paying all claims or court judgments made since the 
first order in august or until the new oct 6 expiration date 
the trust was created in 1988 as part of manville corps 
bankruptcy court reorganization which was forced by mounting 
liability for lung cancer and other serious and fatal diseases 
caused by asbestos 
leon silverman a new york attorney appointed by weinstein as a 
special adviser to restructure the trust said negotiations were 
continuing on completing a reorganization plan 
under the freeze the trust is permitted to make payments for 
hardship claims and emergency health needs as well as operating 
expenses legal fees of trust attorneys and silvermans fees 
the trust to date has settled close to 24000 claims for more 
than 1 billion from people made sick inhaling asbestos fibers 
mostly during shipbuilding and other construction about a third of 
that money has gone toward lawyers fees 
the trust faces 130000 more claims it cant meet the 
reorganization order came after the trust said it was out of money 
to pay new claims it said would not be met until well into the 21st 
century 
the reorganization is designed to speed payments and alter the 
compensation scheme to process claims based on victims health and 
financial need rather than when they file a claim 
the trust effectively owns 80 percent of denverbased manville 
which must make annual payments to the trust beginning next year 
and is shielded from further legal liability for asbestos claims 
the cash shortage at the trust had been anticipated but made 
worse by more cases larger payouts and quicker settlements than 
expected victims had received an average of 43000 per claim 
compared with estimates of 25000

while saddam hussein has given new 
urgency to an old debate over whether americas friends should bear 
more of the burden for defending democracy the response from most 
allies in the current crisis has been far from overwhelming 
treasury secretary nicholas brady is on an 18500mile odyssey 
that has taken him from europe to asia in search of economic 
assistance while secretary of state james a baker iii launched 
his own middle east fundraising mission thursday in the saudi 
arabian capital of jiddah 
the two cabinet members are seeking aid to defray the high cost 
of keeping a protective us military shield on the saudikuwaiti 
border 
back at home a third cabinet officer defense secretary dick 
cheney was keeping the verbal pressure on declaring in a speech 
we need to have some of our friends step up to the counter and 
contribute more than some of them have indicated that they are 
prepared to contribute 
shortly after baker arrived saudi arabia said it would commit 
several billion dollars toward the cost of defending the kingdoms 
oil fields 
and following meetings earlier this week in paris and london 
brady insisted he was getting strong words of encouragement 
especially from british prime minister margaret thatcher 
but while the words have been effusive the flow of money from 
most countries has not 
neither the french nor the british committed to specific dollar 
amounts and officials of the 12nation european community were 
scheduled to take up the question of increased assistance at a 
meeting friday 
while one official traveling with brady on the flight from 
london to seoul said it would not be unreasonable for the allies to 
pick up the entire 1 billion monthly cost of the us troop 
buildup that statement was viewed more as a negotiating ploy than 
a reasonable expectation of the outcome 
for one thing the brady delegation faced an even harder sell in 
meetings friday with south korean president roh taewoo and 
japanese prime minister toshiki kaifu 
the administration is turning to the two economic powerhouses in 
asia for support since both nations depend heavily on middle 
eastern oil 
japan has pledged 1 billion to support the troop buildup but 
did so only after bush made a personal call to kaifu 
the administration says privately what critics in congress are 
saying openly that japan should do much more given the size of 
its economy 
the current debate has echoes that reach back to the height of 
the cold war when critics contended that americas huge military 
burden was diverting resources from critical areas such as making 
the investments needed to boost productivity 
japan and other countries without large military obligations 
were getting a free ride the argument went allowing them to make 
the enormous investments needed to complete effectively in the 
world marketplace 
in dispatching brady and bush on their money missions president 
bush declared that the shape of the postcold war world was at 
stake in the persian gulf crisis 
what he left unsaid was that america hobbled by a sluggish 
economy and a huge mountain of debt can no longer afford to go it 
alone 
but officials traveling with brady insist that the fundraising 
effort would make sense even if the administration werent 
bedeviled by the mammoth budget deficit 
they note that when the european community dismantles its 
economic barriers in 1992 the combined economies of its dozen 
members will equal americas 5 trillion annual gross national 
product meanwhile japans exploding gnp could well surpass that 
of the united states by the end of this decade 
we live in a changing world whether there is a budget deficit 
or not said one senior official traveling with brady who spoke 
on condition that he not be named in that changed world we 
americans have a right to expect that the burdens will be shared 
more appropriately 
despite the lukewarm public response from countries being 
targeted for aid other forces could prod the allies to do more 
for one thing japan risks triggering an avalanche of resentment 
in its biggest foreign market unless it pays a bigger share 
in addition there is a belief that the allies cannot afford to 
waver in this effort given the threat posed by iraqi president 
saddam hussein 
both the brady and baker missions were designed as highly 
visible campaigns to demonstrate that the allies are a united 
force thus raising the stakes considerably if there is a perceived 
failure 
one of the most important audiences for this whole thing is 
saddam hussein said another official on bradys plane who spoke 
on background we need to let him see that this is not one 
country or a couple of countries but it really is the whole 
world

top michigan officials expressed 
satisfaction thursday with the credit ratings given a new program 
designed to help young couples save for the down payments for their 
first homes 
gov james blanchard said michigan got the highest credit rating 
possible for shortterm bonds to be sold under the home ownership 
savings trust 
the ratings for longterm bonds in the host program parallel 
michigans overall bond rating and are just one notch below the 
highest said state treasurer robert bowman 
both said the interest rates reflect the evaluation of 
michigans financial strength especially when compared to other 
areas of the nation which are slumping 
the host program guarantees money invested in it will grow at 
least as fast as housing inflation in michigan 
moodys investors service rated the shortterm bonds mig1 and 
standard amp poors corp gave them a sp1 rating officials said 
longterm features of the host program for investments lasting 
more than about a year will carry an aa rating from standard amp 
poors a1 from moodys and aa from fitch investors service 
acquiring a credit rating was needed to market the host bonds 
which will go on sale shortly officials said 
under the program investors can buy the general obligation 
bonds with monthly payments a lump sum or a combination of both 
for up to five years the investors estimate how much theyll need 
for a down payment and a payment schedule is set based on that 
the minimum savings plan would require payments of 50 a month 
bowman said 
about 6000 people have expressed interest in the taxfree host 
investments so far officials said

financially troubled mack trucks inc 
announced thursday it has approved an 81 million buyout by renault 
vehicules industriels sa 
mack said the agreement which calls for the parisbased renault 
to pay 625 a share was reached earlier in the week 
renault started the week with 445 percent of macks 29 million 
shares on wednesday the french firm purchased 45 percent more 
the french firm hopes to buy the rest of the stock by sept 20 
said renault spokesman bill catacosinos 
the car company has been trying to buy out the allentownbased 
firm for several months saying it was making the offer because 
of the continuing deterioration of the financial condition of 
mack and the need to restructure the companys debt 
mack lost a record 1854 million last year and lost 972 
million in the six months ending june 30 
net sales for the first half of 1990 were 7939 million a 22 
percent decrease from the 1 billion in sales in the 1989 period 
the companys fiveyear financial plan in july projected a net 
loss of about 130 million for this year at the time mack 
officials said they did not expect the company to show a profit 
before 1992 
in the past year mack has tried to reduce business costs and 
conserve cash amid a slowing market for heavy trucks 
macks financial advisor bt securities corp called the 625 
per share offer fair 
mack spokesman james a santanasto said thursday the merger 
would have no immediate effect on the truck companys employees 
this just reflects a corporate change he said 
catacosinos said it was too early to predict any changes 
this is still in the preliminary stages he said 
mack is one of north americas largest producers of heavyduty 
diesel trucks mack also markets a line of mediumduty diesel 
trucks throughout north america and parts of central america 
australia and new zealand

american textile and fiber makers are talking 
tougher 
they have dumped the celebrities who grinned as they flashed the 
made in usa labels for the cameras in those old buyamerican 
commercials 
in a new round of ads that debut this weekend on nbcs telecast 
of the miss america pageant they show shoppers making excuses for 
buying imports while workers cart their belongings outside a plant 
closing for good 
in another commercial a mother explains to her bewildered young 
son that they are moving because his fathers plant shut down 
why did the plant close the boy asks because a lot of people 
are buying clothes made in other countries not ours mom replies 
welcome to the sober new world as seen by the crafted with pride 
in usa council a nonprofit organization set up in 1984 to 
encourage sales of usmade clothes and home furnishings and its 
ad agency warwick baker amp fiore 
robert e swift executive director of the council said the 
group decided on the new approach in reponse to surveys that 
indicate consumers are growing more concerned about their reduced 
standard of living 
imported clothing for instance accounts for nearly 60 percent 
of all clothing sales in the united states he said 
but when americans are asked about imports he said they usually 
cite the car market where foreigners have captured only a 
onethird share 
swift said he hopes the ads get american consumers to think 
about what impact imports are having in apparel and furnishings as 
well 
the council estimates that nearly 500000 jobs have been lost in 
the us apparel and textile industries since 1980 swift said the 
new ads should make consumers aware that job losses and plant 
shutdowns not only hurt american workers but hurt the community 
tax base and their own standard of living 
swift declined to say how much the council would spend over the 
next year to run the ads on television but he said the new 
campaign will start off with more support than the council has 
spent in launching any earlier campaign 
the celebrity campaign that kicked off the councils made in 
usa campaign in 1985 was useful in calling attention to the 
quality and value of americanmade products swift said 
while imports share of the clothes market rose to 59 percent 
last year from 47 percent in 1985 he said the pace at which the 
imports share was rising has slowed considerably

oldsmobile dealers will offer a 
warranty and roadside assistance program on used cars by the end of 
the year general motors corp officials said thursday 
the program is expected to help oldsmobile dealers resell cars 
originally purchased by large fleet buyers such as rentalcar 
companies 
mercedesbenz is the only other automaker to offer a special 
usedcar warranty 
the oldsmobile program is an extension of the oldsmobile 
edge program offered on all new cars sold by the gm division 
that program included provisions for return of a new oldsmobile for 
credit toward a new one and a roadside assistance program 
oldsmobile general manager michael losh said that during the 
last year about 12 percent of new oldsmobiles bought were 
returned under the oldsmobile edge program he estimated a 1 
percent rate when he announced the program last year 
about half of the cars were returned because customers changed 
their minds about a feature of the vehicle and the other half were 
returned because of problems with the vehicle he said 
the usedcar program called value rated covers 
qualifying 198489 cars on oldsmobile dealer lots no matter what 
make with less than 50000 miles 
cars qualifying for the warranty must pass a check list similar 
to one used for every used car on an oldsmobile dealers usedcar 
lot the program should help dealers by offering shoppers 
lowerpriced cars at oldsmobile dealerships losh said 
its a way for our dealers to extend our product line he 
said 
the company also will offer a value rated plus program for 
oldsmobiles from the 1990 or 1991 model years that program is 
aimed at directly helping dealers sell cars that were owned by 
fleet purchasers said roy pikus oldsmobiles direct marketing 
manager 
a cost hasnt been fixed but pikus estimated it would be 
between 200 and 300 and probably would be passed on to the 
customer through the price of the used car 
the mercedesbenz program covers only cars made since 1980 by 
the west german company which have less than 100000 miles on them 
the mercedes program is also geared toward dealers 
mercedes spokesman ab schuman said thursday that company 
research shows that about 62 percent of the 4000 people who bought 
used cars under warranty last year were firsttime mercedes buyers 
72 percent said they would buy another mercedes and 25 percent said 
they would buy a new mercedes

the argentina supreme court 
decided thursday evening to review the latest legal challenge to 
the controversial sale of the stateowned carrier aerolineas 
argentinas 
hours earlier administrative law judge oscar garzon funes 
ordered the sale suspended because the proposed buyers made the 
down payment by letter of credit instead of cash 
garzon funes gave the public works ministry eight days to 
explain why it accepted the letter of credit after which he said 
he would decide whether to annul the sale 
the supreme court took the case out of judge garzon funes hands 
on the grounds that it would be speedier to issue a single final 
ruling rather than have the case drag out in appeals courts 
six of the nine justices voted in favor including all five 
nominated by president carlos menem 
a consortium led by spains state airline iberia agreed last 
july to buy 85 percent of aerolineas for 260 million and the 
retirement of 2 billion of argentinas foreign debt 
the down payment of 130 million due aug 21 was paid by 
letter of credit to the banco hispanamericano in new york 
iberia spokesman margarita blanco said from madrid last week 
that the consortium did not feel obliged to tie up 130 million in 
cash because the argentine government had not fulfilled its 
obligation to obtain a waiver or approval from creditor banks 
the underlying issue for argentina however is the consortiums 
financial stability and its intentions for the second largest 
commercial fleet in latin america 
opponents of the sale including aerolineas labor unions and 
nationalist elements of the ruling peronist party claim the 
consortium is trying to sell or lease planes to come up with the 
down payment and may not intend to invest in the airline as 
pledged 
the vice president of the privatization committee of the lower 
house of congress alberto natale last week urged the government 
of president carlos menem to set aside the sale because the 
consortium did not comply with its agreement 
menem wants to sell aerolineas and virtually every other company 
operated by the state as a way to reduce the fiscal deficit and 
reorient argentina toward a free market economy 
however even the president indicated he is irritated with how 
the sale now appears to be stalled 
asked to comment on a thursday report in the newspaper clarin 
that the consortium has requested the governments permission to 
sell some aerolineas planes to come up with the down payment menem 
said a maneuver of that kind would not be acceptable to the 
government

the chairman of the federal reserve board told 
a senate committee thursday he believed mortgage interest rates 
would rise only slightly if the governmentbacked mortgagebuying 
corporations were forced to maintain the highest private credit 
ratings 
however in his letter to sen donald riegle dmich chairman 
of the banking committee chairman alan greenspan did not give a 
numerical estimate of the likely increase saying only that studies 
suggested it would be relatively small 
in followup questions to recent greenspan testimony riegle had 
noted the treasurys proposal that the federal home loan mortgage 
corp and the federal national mortgage association be required to 
win and maintain the best private credit ratings triplea ratings 
from the private credit rating agencies 
riegle asked for greenspans estimate of how much mortgage 
interest rates would rise if the proposal were adopted 
rates would be expected to rise because the corporations would 
be required to raise more shareholder capital to win the highest 
rating they can operate with less capital now because the credit 
and capital markets assume the government would not let the 
corporations fail 
in his response greenspan said it was unclear how much of the 
subsidy represented by the implicit government guarantee gets 
passed along to people who take out mortgages and how much is 
retained by shareholders of the corporations 
but greenspan noted that prices of shares in the corporations 
had declined following the treasury proposal suggesting a 
sizeable proportion of the subsidy has gone to shareholders 
studies suggest the subsidy going to mortgage holders which 
would be lost under the treasury proposal is relatively 
small greenspan wrote

the federal reserve boards order voiding a 
delaware law that allows banks to sell insurance nationwide was the 
result of a turf battle between the central bank and the federal 
deposit insurance corp banking officials said thursday 
the insurance industry however which sought the order by 
filing a complaint against citicorps insurance operation scored 
the decision as a major victory 
the delaware law enacted in may allows banks incorporated in 
the state to write insurance policies nationwide through a 
subsidiary 
the fed on wednesday said delawares law violated federal 
regulations and ordered citicorp to close its insurance business in 
dover 
what theyre really trying to do is take the authority away 
from the states and the fdic in hopes congress will put them the 
fed in charge of the banking system its all about turf said 
philip s corwin director of retail banking for the american 
bankers association in washington 
the feds order targeted family guardian life insurance co a 
company controlled by citicorps whollyowned citibank of delaware 
the company opened june 1 with plans to hire 500 people 
richard t collins citibank delaware vice president said bank 
officials were reviewing the order but the dover operation had not 
been closed 
when the law was being drafted the fdic asked that it include 
safeguards to protect the banks capital and deposits 
the reserve board said those safeguards were so restrictive 
they in effect barred the banks from the insurance business 
therefore the board ruled the delaware law violated a federal 
law that bars a subsidiary or division from engaging in a business 
which the parent company is barred from engaging in 
james b watt president of the conference of state bank 
supervisors in washington said the reserve board was using a 
technical interpretation to prevent something they dont want to 
happen 
corwin and ellis both said they believed the state was caught in 
a turf war between the reserve board and the fdic 
they put us in a catch22 to do all the fdic wants and 
basically the federal reserve said because you did such a good job 
were not going to let you do it thats untenable everyone is in 
amazement ellis said 
he said state officials will meet to determine what delaware 
will do next gov michael n castle had no comment 
the feds order was the result of a petition from a coalition of 
insurance trade groups to bar citicorps insurance business 
claiming the law would create unfair competition in the industry 
since 1981 delaware has enacted several laws aimed at financial 
services 
for instance in 1981 the state enacted a law offering tax 
breaks for credit card operations and eliminating interest rate 
ceilings on credit cards the purpose was to convince outofstate 
banks to move their credit card operations to delaware 
the bankinginsurance law was aimed at banks that relocated or 
opened subsidiaries under the 1981 law
