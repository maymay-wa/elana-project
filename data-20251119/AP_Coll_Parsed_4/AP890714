we told our people to go back to work but they told us no 
donald watson vice president of umw local 1071 said late friday 
in the past the umw has maintained it has not asked the workers 
to stay away from the coal mines and many umw rankandfile have 
ignored backtowork orders from judges 
trumka asked the wildcat strikers to return to work until july 
26 when the unions international executive board meets 
as the regular work schedule resumes on monday and our members 
return to work we assume that the industry will cooperate with our 
efforts to help restore stability in the coal fields trumka said

monday union spokesman joe corcoran said 
trumka said miners would continue the memorial or cooling off 
periods in umw district 31 in north central west virginia from next 
monday through thursday and in umw district 6 in ohio and west

headquarters said virginia police sgt mike frank there were no 
injuries and no arrests were made frank said

were very concerned about incidents such as this pittston 
spokeswoman susan copeland said she said security would be 
increased at the headquarters 
corcoran said he and other union officials were unaware of the

environmentalists offered a plan friday 
aimed at preserving ancient forests in the pacific northwest while 
allowing timber companies to cut down more trees 
the federal government has been prevented from selling many older 
forest stands to timber companies because of court injunctions won 
by environmental groups who argued the stands may be the last 
remaining habitat for the northern spotted owl 
the injunctions have drastically reduced the supply of logs for 
lumber mills in the northwest the plan offered friday would release 
490 million board feet of timber currently barred from logging under 
court injunctions 
a compromise plan worked out at a meeting of environmentalists 
timber industry officials and politicians last month went up in 
smoke when some environmental groups said it allowed for too much 
logging 
reaction to the latest proposal was mixed 
im encouraged said rep peter defazio dore i think 
its a thoughtful albeit somewhat complicated response 
but rachel gorlin press secretary to rep less aucoin dore 
said it raises as many questions as it seems to answer 
and jim geisinger president of the northwest forestry 
association said the plan strayed too far from the original 
framework for the summit compromise 
they want to be in charge of managing the national forests 
said geisinger who represented the timber industry at the summit 
i dont think we are prepared to turn that responsibility over to 
them 
overall the environmentalists offer would allow 96 billion 
board feet of federal timber to be harvested in oregon and 
washington over the next 15 months andy kerr conservation 
dirrector of the oregon natural resouces council emphasized at a 
news conference friday that the offer covered only the 1989 and 1990 
fiscal years 
the harvest level is 400 million board feet less than was 
proposed in the plan developed at the june 24 summit although the 
environmentalists called their proposal a minor reduction 
congressional aides who asked not to be identified said the 400 
million amounted to enough timber to supply four mediumsized mills 
with logs for a year 
under the plan 37 billion board feet would be available for 
harvest in national forests the remainder of this fiscal year 39 
billion could be harvested on national forests in the 1990 fiscal 
year and a billion could be harvested on bureau of land management 
land in each of the two fiscal years 
a lot of this was difficult because we are bleeding kerr 
said this plan is not sustainable for timber production and not 
sustainable for spotted owl production 
any longterm plan he said would have to provide more severe 
limits on federal logging with a greater emphasis on improving 
production on private timberland 
the plan would allow harvesting of small fragmented stands 
spotted owl habitat selected by environmentalists and areas that are 
not spotted owl habitat but have been protected by the injunctions

a homemade bomb exploded outside a 
discotheque in northern honduras early thursday and wounded seven 
american soldiers four of them seriously officials reported 
two other americans in the group escaped injury no one claimed 
responsibility for the fourth attack on us troops in honduras 
since feb 1 
witnesses say the bomb was apparently thrown from a car but 
the scenario is still confused said anne sigmund of the us 
embassy they dont say if the bomb was thrown from a moving car 
or a parked car were still investigating 
the soldiers had gone into la ceiba a coastal town 200 miles 
north of tegucigalpa in civilian dress and without proper leave 
embassy spokesman charles v barclay said 
they were not authorized to go into town he said in a 
telephone interview the group was part of a convoy carrying 
equipment and machinery from puerto castilla to enrique soto cano 
air base i have no further details for the moment 
officials said the convoy of about 150 americans was returning 
wednesday from a roadbuilding exercise with honduran troops and 
stopped at la ceiba for the night puerto castilla is 250 miles 
north of tegucigalpa 
the four most seriously injured soldiers were flown to a military 
hospital in san antonio texas and the other three were being 
treated at soto cano 50 miles northeast of tegucigalpa the embassy 
said 
the names were withheld pending notification of relatives 
col eric sanchez the honduran military commander at la ceiba 
said by telephone the explosion occurred at the lido discotheque 
and four honduran suspects were being questioned he would say 
nothing further about the suspects 
sanchez said the two uninjured soldiers were turned over to us 
officers from the soto cano base because they refused to talk and 
demanded a lawyer the soldiers had been working in the valle del 
aguan 125 miles east of la ceiba barclay said the united states 
has had facilities at the soto cano base in central honduras for 
years and about 1200 us military personnel are assigned there on 
sixmonth rotating tours 
honduras has been the scene of frequent us military exercises 
since 1982 in part as a political signal to the leftist sandinista 
government in nicaragua which borders honduras to the south 
many hondurans resent the increased us military role in the 
central american nation as well as the use of honduran territory by 
ussupported contra rebels battling nicaraguas government 
on april 11 assailants attacked a jeep convoy carrying us 
soldiers outside olanchita near la ceiba one jeep was disabled 
but nobody was injured 
on feb 1 assailants fired at an american military convoy in 
northern yoro province no one was injured 
on feb 18 three american soldiers and two honduran passersby 
were wounded when a bomb was detonated under a passing bus in 
comayagua near soto cano 
a shadowy leftist group calling itself the morazanista national 
liberation front claimed responsibility for all three attacks this 
year and for attacks in 1983 and 1987 
the group formed in 1979 and named after francisco morazan who 
ruled honduras from 1829 to 1832 it is believed to be part of the 
outlawed communist party 
in addition to the attacks on us military personnel other 
violent incidents in honduras have raised fears of increased 
activity by leftwing guerrillas and rightwing death squads 
six people have been assassinated in the last three weeks 
including a university professor shot to death wednesday a union 
leader and a student leader 
on jan 25 former military chief gen gustavo alvarez martinez 
was assassinated he helped found the nicaraguan rebel movement in 
honduras while head of the military from 1982 to 1984

two former thrift executives were sentenced 
thursday to six months in prison for their role in a scheme to use 
money from the thrift for illegal political contributions 
the executives of commodore savings association e morten 
hopkins and john harrell were given fiveyear sentences by us 
district judge joe fish who suspended all but six months of the 
sentences 
commodores former owner robert h hopkins jr was sentenced 
wednesday to 15 years in prison for creating the donation scheme 
which began in 1982 
a jury in may convicted the hopkins brothers on 47 counts 
including conspiracy making false entries into the records of a 
bank misappropriation of funds and making false statements to a 
federal agency 
harrell former commodore chief executive was convicted on two 
counts of making false entries into the records of a bank but 
acquitted on the other charges 
fish also ordered all three men to pay restitution to the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp for money diverted from the thrift 
the fslic will recover 104062 from the judgment with harrell to 
pay about 4000 and the hopkins brothers to pay the balance 
federal law prohibits corporate contributions to political 
campaigns 
during the trial thrift employees testified they gave money to 
political action committees and were reimbursed through pay 
increases or checks for fictional travel 
prosecutors alleged the defendants tried to hide contributions to 
members of congress including rep jim wright dtexas who was 
then embroiled in an ethics investigation that led to his 
resignation 
prosecutors said there was no evidence that recipients of the 
contributions knew of the scheme 
attorney carol vance who represented the defendants did not 
return a phone call from the associated press 
prosecutor david jarvis said the case was the first involving 
illegal political contributions to be tried at the felony level the 
charge is a misdemeanor but was upgraded because the defendants 
were accused of making false statements to a federal agency and 
entering false information in bank records

young descendants of immigrants 
who crossed the atlantic in years past to work in the fields and 
factories of argentina are taking the journey in reverse nowadays as 
the nation sinks deep into recession 
this is my home and i hope to return to it and live and die 
here but not if it means starving to death because i dont have any 
work aldo bignone a 23yearold auto mechanic said as he stood 
outside the spanish consulate to apply for a visa 
rodrigo imas a 30yearold print shop employee said his 
grandfather told him many times about the fourweek trip he made 
from italy in the hold of a freighter to start a new life in 
argentina 
now im hoping to find enough money to buy a oneway ticket on 
aerolineas argentinas imas said the transportation has changed 
and the direction is reversed but the idea is the same 
as inflation and interest rates have soared out of control and 
the austral currency falls to a tiny fraction of its worth just five 
months ago businesses have closed by the score and thousands of 
workers have been laid off 
argentines who consider themselves lucky just to have jobs have 
watched in dismay as food gasoline cigarettes movie tickets and 
virtually everything else have shot up in price while wages in real 
terms have shrunk 
argentines have left for years for a variety of reasons a decade 
ago it was to escape the violence of leftwing subversion followed 
by a brutal crackdown that began with a military coup in march 1976 
for the past several years argentines have left in search of 
economic opportunity however and visa applications have 
accelerated as the economy has deteriorated in recent months 
with the austral trading at about 590 to the dollar a teacher 
who earned 100 a month at the end of 1988 would have been earning a 
little as 40 at the end of june a newspaper reporter who earned 
300 now earns 90 a bilingual marketing administrator could well 
have seen his pay fall from 300 to 135 and a bank economist from 
700 to 300 some of those employers have taken their own measures 
to offset inflation 
a lot of people are thinking that their children have limited 
futures said the canadian consul andree bazinet they get all 
these skills at the university and cant use them in argentina we 
get some of our highest quality acceptances from argentina 
in 1986 the canadian embassy received 188 applications for 
immigrant visas and in the first five months of this year 
applications stood at 1292 only 275 were issued 
the argentine government issues no figures on the number or job 
skills of emigrants but officials at variousd consulates said visa 
applications are way up and usually its the best educated and best 
trained who are taken 
the longest lines are outside the consulates of spain and italy 
the countries to which a majority of argentines trace their roots 
italy generally offers visas to grandchildren of its emigrants and 
spain to children of people born in those countries who never 
renounced their citizenship 
those visas are coveted because they will allow argentines to 
work thoughout western europe beginning in 1992 when the european 
economic community is unified into a single market 
australia granted about 480 immigrant visas in 1986 and 1987 the 
consulate said and inquiries for the ninemonth period that ended 
in march skyrocketed to 16330 it gave no figures on the number of 
visas to be granted 
daniel fainstein dean of the latin american rabbinic seminary 
estimated that 2000 jews left argentina last year for israel 
there has been an increase because of the permanent 
instability and insecurity here he said 
the united states issued 1450 to 1500 immigrant visas to 
argentines in the past few years a consular officer said the 
number of applications is not kept but it clearly exceeds the 
number of acceptances and probably has increased in recent months 
the official added 
standing in line at the us consulate jose ponti said he hopes 
to move to baltimore md to work in his uncles clothing store 
my family split in two after world war ii said ponti 27 
who works on the buenos aires subway one part went to the us 
another part came here to argentina the american side of the family 
is doing very well

timothy dalton was faced with two of the 
toughest acts to follow but he has managed by talent and sheer 
perseverance to bring james bond to life in a new modernized style 
that could carry 007 into the 21st century 
the 44yearold briton was here for the opening of licence to 
kill 16th of the adventures not counting two unofficial films 
that have generated more dollars than any film series in movie 
history 
most critics have found dalton at ease in his second goround as 
bond his first the living daylights was not written for him 
he also seemed relaxed in an interview as if he had come to grips 
with a classic role that might have overwhelmed him he admitted 
having enormous pause when he first considered it 
my concern was not about creating the character which after 
all is my job said dalton if i do it well then thats 
terrific if i fail then thats also part of being an actor 
the pause was over how to deal with it how to bring an 
audience with you away from its history and into its new present 
very clearly before i took it on i knew that everyone has an 
opinion about bond its part of the cinemagoing consciousness 
everyone has an opinion about the actors who have played bond 
before half the world loved sean connery half the world loved 
roger moore their films existed in two very different styles you 
know when you take it on you run the risk of having the whole world 
hate what you do if that had happened it would have been a major 
catastrophe fortunately it didnt he said 
what one must face today is that weve got something new 
something different this is a new style of bond it isnt a 
lighthearted comedic spoofing bond its not a technological 
extravaganza i think its back down to its origins its basics 
trying to capture the spirit of ian fleming and of the early movies 
i loved dr no and from russia with love they were very 
exciting adventurethrillers i watched the train sequence of sean 
connery and robert shaw the other day its still tremendously 
exciting 
previewers noted that dalton seemed to be performing much of his 
own action but he discounted any threat to his safety 
i think the strenuous side of a bond movie is the sheer amount 
of time to make one six months which is a very very long 
schedule he said youre on location so you work long hours 
the crew works 15 hours a day we go back watch rushes talk about 
tomorrows work so its 18 hours a day 
dalton had a thriving career before producer cubby broccoli chose 
him as the fourth james bond george lazenby had a single shot in 
on her majestys secret service 1969 
he grew up in manchester with nonprofessional parents 
my grandfather and grandmother were in vaudevillemusic 
halls dalton said but my parents were not involved in the 
theater it skipped a generation 
i suppose i first became interested just like most kids of my 
generation by going to the saturday morning pictures you find 
yourself in a very exciting rare different world an extraordinary 
coincidence the first fulllength feature film i saw was the red 
beret starring alan ladd i discovered recently that it was 
produced by cubby broccoli the very first picture that i saw at 
five or six years old was produced by the man im now working for 
dalton studied at the royal academy of dramatic arts and appeared 
in classics from repertory to the west end his film debut was 
auspicious as the young king of france in the lion in winter 
with katharine hepburn and peter otoole other films have included 
cromwell wuthering heights as heathcliff agatha and 
a curiosity sextette with mae west 
although sextette was seen by few dalton found working with 
the film legend a rare experience 
she claimed to be 84 but some oldtimers said she was 90 he 
recalled it was amazing to be working at her old studio 
paramount and see her come to life every day as she did the thing 
she loved 
how long will dalton remain with bond 
he laughed heartily before replying licence to kill started 
to do extremely well in europe if it does well here im sure there 
will be another one but for how long ill continue i dont 
know

worldclass dancer is coming home to america with moscows 
bolshoi ballet 
five years after he said goodbye to his mother in los angeles 
he is back for a fiveweek crosscountry tour as the only american 
dancer with the bolshoi ballet academy the official school for what 
many consider the worlds most prestigious ballet company 
in the intervening years always without family and usually 
without money young shannon worked and danced his way halfway 
around the world being supported variously by the governments of 
the united states canada sweden hungary and the soviet union 
hes also found himself in finland italy austria 
czechoslovakia and bulgaria and along the way learned to speak 
russian hungarian and italian 
its been in a literal sense a long leap 
its kind of strange shannon said in a backstage interview 
at suburban washingtons wolf trap theater i left home at 14 
forever now i feel like a foreigner coming back home 
when i left my mother said ill miss you and love you but i 
want you to have a better life than i have shannon said i have 
no other family we come from what you would call the lower end of 
the middle class and she had to borrow money for my plane ticket 
the first stop was canada as he traded his southern california 
love of surfing swimming and baseball for a chance to dance i 
still didnt know if id make it he says now 
it wasnt easy even years later when he was discovered by madame 
sophia golovkina director of classical dance at the moscow academy 
choreographic school and a stern but loved master of the ballet 
now in her 70s madame golovkina discovered shannon at a 
ballet competition in jackson miss on one of his brief stopovers 
in this country since moving away 
shes been like a mother to me ever since and worked to get me

bolshoi dancers shannon said 
already the recipient of an award from the us national 
foundation for the arts and the first american graduate of the 
hungarian state ballet institute shannon scraped together some 
money packed his bags and ent to moscow 
there was no cultural exchange at that time shannon said 
i was an exchange student without an exchange program and i spent 
every day going from one government ministry to another looking for 
support 
i lived in a hotel and on the last day when i ran out of money 
they called and said you can stay shannon recalled relief 
still clear in his voice 
they dont have any foreigners shannon said of the academy 
which was founded in 1773 and annually draws thousands of young 
soviets hoping to be admitted as students 
although he hasnt been formally admitted to the actual bolshoi 
ballet company shannon hopes to win that honor during or shortly 
after the current us tour the academys first us visit in 20 
years id be the very first american theyve given me so much 
id like to stay for years and bring what ive learned over there 
back here

below the surface frenzied officials faced lastminute crises 
organizers of the giant friday night parade hired sharpshooters 
with tranquilizer guns in case the elephants decided to moonwalk 
down the champselysees with the florida aampm marching band 
it was not immediately clear how fast a tranquilizer dart worked 
or what one did with an inert elephant in the middle of a parade 
authorities had planned a temporary ban of alcohol along the

the industry fearing continued thievery during this summers 
harvest turned to the legislature this spring for help 
lawmakers passed a berry bill that was signed into law by gov 
john r mckernan it is designed to give authorities the tools to 
track down the illegal pickers and end the black market make that 
blue market in berries 
the law requires pickers to get written permission of landowners 
and requires anyone who transports 25 pounds or more to get a 
numbered permit from the maine blueberry commission packers and 
shippers must also keep account of the blueberries they receive in 
lots of 25 pounds or more 
finally the law authorizes police sheriffs forest rangers and 
game wardens to make inspections and arrests and investigate 
blueberry thefts 
maine is one of the nations leading producers of blueberries 
and they are one of its largest cash crops blueberries are a 70 
million a year industry in the state according to ed mclaughlin of 
the blueberry commission 
mclaughlin said thefts are worst in seasons when the price is 
highest he estimated the loss during the 1988 season at 1 million 
suspected thieves confronted by wyman employees typically claim 
they took the berries from someone elses fields said phillips 
others spotted in the act make easy getaways on the dirt roads that 
wind through the hilly barrens 
these people are doing it for money said phillips who added 
that organized thieves tend to go where the berries grow the best 
its a big business 
while people in the industry say the law was a long time coming 
some casual roadside pickers believe the state has gone too far 
for heavens sake the most i would ever take is three or four 
quarts said a woman who asked that her name not be used 
theyve roped off all of the good blueberry patches im miffed 
ill just have to sneak in after dark

a top aide to former housing secretary samuel 
pierce wants immunity from prosecution in exchange for testimony 
implicating pierce in the influencepeddling scandal at the agency 
sources said thursday 
the sources who asked not to be identified by name said deborah 
gore dean has told congressional investigators she can testify that 
pierce ordered funding for specific projects under the section 8 
moderate rehabilitation program 
the program was briefly suspended after hud auditors criticized 
the selection process and said a number of prominent republicans had 
been able to steer millions of dollars to their clients 
the sources said ms dean demanded immunity from prosecution in 
exchange for answering questions from the house subcommittee 
investigating abuses at hud during pierces eightyear tenure as 
secretary 
one source said she told the committee that she could testify 
that pierce personally ordered funding for numerous projects 
the source declined to be more specific 
a congressional source said rep thomas lantos dcalif 
chairman of the subcommittee was considering such a deal with an 
open mind but had not made a decision 
ms dean earlier refused to testify citing her fifth amendment 
rights against selfincrimination she spent three years as pierces 
executive assistant and has been described by former colleagues as 
wielding great influence 
pierce told the subcommittee last month he had no direct role in 
funding decisions in the section 8 or any other program since then 
however the wall street journal has reported that pierce intervened 
on behalf of several associates including a former law partner 
subcommittee members have told pierce who moved back to 
manhattan to resume his law and business dealings that they want to 
question him again 
word on the negotiations between congressional investigators and 
ms dean came as hud officials more than doubled to 11 billion 
their estimate of the losses in one program suspended because of 
scandals plaguing the agency 
the washington post said in fridays editions that hud hired 
attorney peter e novick to head a program that three years earlier 
had losses estimated at nearly 240000 because novick made false 
statements working as a settlement attorney in real estate 
transactions 
novick 47 pleaded guilty may 25 in us district court to one 
count of making a false statement and has been ordered to report in 
midaugust to a halfway house to serve a oneyear sentence however 
a memorandum filed earlier this year in court by federal prosecutors 
said novick made false statements in 18 separate real estate 
transactions from 1982 to 1984 the newspaper said 
novick was rehired by hud in february 1987 after talking with 
thomas demery the assistant secretary for housing during the later 
part of the reagan administration 
the senate banking committee also voted to launch its own 
investigation into hud operations during the reagan administration 
joining the two house panels already scrutinizing allegations of 
mismanagement fraud and influencepeddling at the 
multibilliondollar agency 
the senate committee said one of its priorities would be a review 
of a coinsurance program under huds federal housing 
administration the subject of a new audit that estimates losses at 
more than double the earlier 452 million figure 
the 11 billion estimate was based on the audit and information 
compiled by fha officials according to a ranking hud official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
hud secretary jack kemp was aware of the estimate tuesday when he 
gave congress a 2 billion ballpark figure as the cost of hud 
mismanagement during the reagan years the official said 
ms deans testimony would mark a dramatic turn in the 
investigation which so far far has centered on influencepeddling 
on the section 8 program suspected abuses of the 5 billion 
coinsurance program and lax agency management that allowed private 
closing agents hired by hud to withhold millions of dollars owed the 
government 
kemp who has suspended or canceled three programs and ordered 
internal reviews of virtually all the agencys housing programs has 
vowed to clean up the department that he took over last winter 
in other developments 
black manafort stone amp kelly a leading gop consulting company 
linked to influencepeddling at hud disclosed far broader dealings 
on hudrelated work than had been described by one of its principal 
members in recent testimony to congress 
paul manafort testified before the employment and housing 
subcommittee last month that his company had lobbied hud for two 
clients however lantos released a memo from manafort saying that 
further review found the company had lobbied hud for several other 
clients 
rep bob traxler dmich chairman of the house appropriations 
subcommitee said its decision not to provide new funding for the 
section 8 program wasnt irreversible but that congress needed 
assurances influencepeddling has been eliminated 
the senate banking committee approved and sent to the full 
senate the nomination of francis a keating ii as huds general 
counsel a post that will have a key role in agency dealings with 
investigations by law enforcement agencies 
the coinsurance program under investigation was among those kemp 
suspended the fbi is investigating the largest private lender under 
the program drg funding corp 
the new york times reported thursday that the fbi probe has 
expanded to include a review of company ties with demery the former 
assistant secretary for housing demery oversaw the coinsurance 
program 
demery in an interview thursday with the associated press said 
he believed documents seized by the fbi from drgs offices likely 
included official correspondence with his office at hud 
theres nothing that would look suspect demery said there 
would be routine correspondence from time to time between my office 
and drg 
demery said he hadnt been contacted by the fbi an agency 
spokeswoman said she could neither confirm not deny that demerys 
actions were a part of the drg investigation

agreement with us banks on debt restructuring to a close 
according to published reports 
the new york times reported in friday editions that the loan is 
contingent on an agreement between mexico and its creditors to 
reduce and rearrange 54 billion in existing loans 
other countries and perhaps commercial sources may also 
contribute to the temporary loan the times said 
in its friday editions the washington post said that mexico and 
the banks had reached a tentative deal 
a senior government official in washington told the associated 
press that he could not confirm the reports because the officials 
involved were with president bush in paris for the sevennation 
economic summit conference 
he said however that he did not believe mexico had reached a 
deal on saturday the negotiators for the two parties said that 
they were near an agreement 
there would have been great pleasure if mexico and the banks 
could have agreed on a deal before the paris summit but when it 
became clear the negotiations would span the summit we werent 
particularly uptight about it said the official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
the mexican government has said it wants to reach an agreement

giving up cigarettes is more than just a 
matter of willpower and smokers need more help just saying no to 
nicotine once they try to quit a federal health official said 
noting that nicotine is an addictive drug john pierce chief 
of epidemiology in the federal office of smoking and health in 
rockville md said former smokers tend to relapse 
it is no longer an issue of getting people to quit but how to 
help people stay off cigarettes he said 
although 17 million smokers attempt to quit each year only 13 
million succeed pierce said and though 60 percent of smokers never 
light up after quitting the rest do he said 
the first through fifth years after quitting is the period that 
needs most attention he said thursday 
pierce an australian epidemiologist who was involved in his 
homelands antismoking program spoke at the start of a twoday 
conference of 130 health educators and practitioners who create 
provide and finance services that help smokers quit 
the sponsor of the national conference on smoking cessation was 
the institute for the study of smoking behavior and policy at 
harvard universitys john f kennedy school of government 
about 50 million americans smoke despite a decline in the 
popularity of smoking it is estimated 40 million people still will 
be puffing away in the year 2000 
are there ways to get more people to use these programs this 
issue needs to be treated more like a business john pinney 
executive director of the smoking institute said in an interview 
its a mass marketing problem were trying to help people 
examine this issue in a way it hasnt been examined before said 
pinney head of the us office of smoking and health in the carter 
administration 
david levinson delaware insurance commissioner and another 
conference speaker said insurance companies need to be compelled to 
offer discounts for nonsmokers and reimbursements for the cost of 
programs smokers use to give up tobacco 
a national leader in pushing for such insurance coverage 
levinson charged that the industry resists such efforts 
the bottom line is that health insurance companies dont want 
to have healthy citizens because then they would make less money 
from medical claims what businessman in america is going to be 
in favor of that levinson said 
he called on government regulators of health insurance to compel 
insurers to offer such coverage more widely 
later in a telephone interview from washington a spokesman for 
the health insurance industry dismissed levinsons charges 
the insurance industry stands second to no one in its efforts 
to reduce smoking said donald b white spokesman for the health 
insurance association of america 
white said health insurers have helped establish programs to 
promote health through the workplace and large health insurers offer 
discounts for individual policy holders who dont smoke 
it is to everyones financial interest to reduce smoking as 
much as possible said white whose lobbying group represents 350 
insurers

purchase is that important he will buy the tickets something 
else in his budget will have to be reduced instead 
town officials planned to meet today to further discuss the issue 
the police chief doesnt think voters would mind paying the 
1500 for the new tickets he said as much as they hate getting 
ticketed they hate being blocked by illegally parked cars more the 
return on the investment also is attractive he said 
parking fines are 5 to 10 and the new tickets would generate 
about 37500 he said 
once the tickets run out oloughlin said hell tell officers to 
tow vehicles parked in tow zones

the national space council working on a 
major new space initiative is focusing on an american return to 
the moon establishing a permanent base and proceeding from there to 
mars 
but it will be expensive warns rep robert walker rpa who 
was among a group of congressmen briefed thursday on several options 
being considered by the council 
any of the options walker said will require a substantial 
increase in resources available to nasa it will require doubling 
the size of nasa and the nasa budget 
the council headed by vice president dan quayle favors the 
moonmars scenario over other courses being considered walker said 
but no final decision has been made quayle nasa administrator 
richard h truly and mark albrecht executive secretary of the space 
council conducted the briefing 
they basically outlined three options walker the ranking 
republican member of the house space science subcommittee said in 
an interview 
one for the united states to move ahead with a robotic program 
and gradually phase men out of the space program another to go 
back to the moon with the idea of establishing a permanent moon base 
and then going from there to mars and third to take us directly to 
mars after the turn of the century 
the council is not expected to make a recommendation about 
americas space future to president bush in time for inclusion in 
his speech next thursday on the 20th anniversary of the first 
landing on the moon 
walker said quayle is basically consulting with the people on 
capitol hill who have something to say about authorizing space funds 
as an advance of space council consideration of a major new space 
initiative 
attending the meeting in the white house complex were the 
chairmen and ranking members of the senate and house subcommittees 
and committees that handle the space program 
the space agency has asked for 13 billion in the next fiscal 
year but is likely to get far less than that from a budgetminded 
congress 
i made the point that they basically were asking for us to find 
about 2 percent of the federal budget for nasa in the 1990s and into 
the next century walker said we were almost double that level 
in the 1960s this nation has shown it is capable of spending 36 
percent of the budget for space activity if the program is truly 
visionary 
the national space council was established by bush as a 
presidential advisory body it includes the secretaries of state 
defense treasury commerce and transportation the director of the 
office of management and budget the white house chief of staff the 
national security adviser the presidents science adviser the 
director of the cia and the nasa administrator

the germanmade car 
the national highway traffic safety administration in a report 
released thursday reiterated its conclusion that most incidents in 
which cars suddenly lurched forward or backward at full speed were 
caused by drivers putting their feet on the wrong pedals 
but the safety agency report also said recalls involving 1978 
through 1986 models were necessary for safety of the audi 5000 and 
other models audis us sales plummeted after a major 1986 recall 
audi recall campaigns to modify the accelerator and brake pedals 
on 1978 through 1983 models install automatic shiftlock systems in 
all models and correct idle speed control systems in 1984 through 
1986 models appear to have resulted in a very substantial 
reduction of the number of sudden acceleration incidents and 
accidents the report said 
further reductions are expected as more vehicles have the recall 
work completed and older cars which do not have the work done are 
scrapped nhtsa said 
some drivers had complained the west germanmade audi 
distributed by volkswagen of america would suddenly accelerate when 
it was shifted out of park into drive or reverse 
in february the traffic safety agency concluded after a 
yearlong study that most such events in audis and other cars are 
caused by drivers pushing the gas pedal when they think they were 
pushing the brake 
but the safety agency said this does not mean drivers are always 
at fault and design flaws may be to blame 
the report said the frequency of wrongpedal incidents appears to 
increase because of the location and possibly the feel of the 
control pedals and by problems involving unexpectedly fast engine 
idle speed which could startle drivers at inopportune times 
audi has had seven recalls since 1982 the major one in 1986 
called back 250000 of the 5000series automobiles to install the 
automatic shiftlock which prevents the transmission from being put 
into forward or reverse without the brake pedal being depressed 
the report said this recall campaign was an effective practical 
countermeasure and other recalls also were necessary 
hansjorg hugerland volkswagen of america president said the 
report ends a grievous period for the company which has long 
maintained that sudden acceleration was not caused by a mechanical 
problem 
now at long last that result is official and the case is 
closed hugerland said 
hugerland also said installation of the shiftlock device caused 
complaints of unintended acceleration real or imagined to drop 
90 percent 
us sales of audis dropped from more than 200 a day before the 
1986 recall to 60 a day for the 1989 models in the first five months 
of this year

the discovery that experimental mutant proteins can 
stop the destructive multiplication of the aids virus may give 
scientists a new weapon in their search for drugs to tame the 
disease scientists say 
in reports in todays issue of the journal cell doctors said 
they crafted these proteins by tinkering with two genes of human 
immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
while one of the researchers called the work a major step 
others were more cautious noting that any practical result of this 
work is probably years away 
some time in the distant future however doctors said these fake 
proteins could be the basis of a cure for acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
in the work scientists changed aids virus genes known as tat and 
rev both produce proteins that are essential for the virus to churn 
out new copies of itself inside the body 
the scientists found that by slightly scrambling the genes they 
can make them produce proteins that dont work but because the 
proteins look like the real thing the aids virus is fooled into 
using them instead of its own natural proteins as a result virus 
replication is shut down 
dr maurice green of st louis university experimented with the 
tat gene and dr bryan r cullen of the howard hughes institute at 
duke university worked with the rev gene 
green said that unlike most proteins the fake tat product can be 
taken in by cells there it will jam up the virus control 
mechanism for viral replication 
we are testing it out against the most virulent strains of aids 
virus and we are very encouraged said green its a major step 
forward as far as im concerned in possible aids therapy 
however dr william haseltine of the dana farber cancer 
institute in boston a codiscoverer of both genes cautioned 
its an interesting concept but its a long way from making a 
useful drug 
the aids virus kills by slipping inside blood cells called t 
cells subverting them to make new copies of the virus and then 
killing the cells people eventually die largely because of the 
destruction of these blood cells which are essential for fighting 
routine infections 
the scientists research suggests two possible ways to combat 
aids 
one is to flood the bloodstream with fake viral proteins that 
will overwhelm the genuine product and shortcircuit reproduction of 
the virus the other probably more difficult approach is to 
implant the viral genes that make these bogus proteins into victims 
bodies so they will produce their own antiviral ammunition 
in the latter approach scientists would implant mutant rev or 
tat genes into a patients bone marrow tissue which makes new blood 
cells the new bone marrow would produce blood cells that carry the 
extra viral genes 
when these cells got infected with the aids virus they would not 
be killed instead the added genes would make proteins that would 
keep the virus from reproducing and destroying the blood cells 
you would end up with a population of t cells that are no 
longer sensitive to the hiv virus said cullen at that point 
you will have reconstituted the persons immune system and they 
should be in great shape 
the longterm promise of this technology is that its a cure 
not just a treatment 
but cullen cautioned that this approach is a long long way 
from reality and no one even knows whether it will work 
in the virus the tat gene is a sort of supercharger vastly 
speeding up its ability to make new copies of itself rev is an 
onoff switch when rev is working the virus will assemble the 
proteins it needs to make new copies but when its shut off no new 
virus will be made

despite the execution of four former cuban 
military officers on drug trafficking charges the state department 
is reluctant to accept an offer from president fidel castro for a 
joint antismuggling campaign 
you dont automatically start negotiating cooperation until you 
have an indication the other side is really serious deputy 
spokesman richard boucher said thursday alleging that drugrelated 
activities in cuba are continuing 
boucher spoke after a cuban war hero and three colleagues were 
executed for shipping tons of drugs to the united states 
boucher said the bush administration did not have access to all 
the evidence in the case and therefore cannot make a judgment about 
the executions 
with regard to policy we of course support vigorous 
prosecution of alleged drug traffickers whoever they may be he 
said 
castro has suggested uscuban cooperation to halt drug 
trafficking but state department officials said they believe its 
possible the cuban leader has known all along about current and past 
use of cuban territory for narcotics shipments 
castro said the drug probe that led to thursdays executions 
began in march after us authorities arrested two traffickers who 
said they used cuba as a transit point for smuggling cocaine from 
colombia 
another reason for us caution in responding to castros offer 
officials said is that they dont want to create with cuba the same 
kind of situation they have faced with gen manuel antonio noriega 
head of panamas defense forces 
noriega they said has cracked down from time to time on his 
adversaries in the drugsmuggling business winning praise from the 
drug enforcement administration while allegedly engaging in aiding 
drug shipments himself 
noriega has been under indictment in florida since february 1988 
for drugrelated offenses 
the cautious us stand has been criticized by rep charles 
rangel dny chairman of the select committee on narcotics he 
has said the administration is squandering an opportunity to strike 
a blow against drug traffickers 
but boucher said the administration has had information linking 
cuba to narcotics smuggling since 1982 and had expressed its 
concerns since then 
three federal indictments implicating cuba in drug trade have 
been handed down since 1982 he said two of the cases have 
disclosed detailed allegations of cuban officials complicity in the 
drug trade which to the best of our knowledge have not been 
investigated by the cuban government 
until the recent arrests cuba rejected allegations that any 
cuban officials were involved in drug trafficking boucher said

hog producers are cutting back on their 
breeding stock but are sending enough animals to market that 1989 
pork output should be up from last year says the agriculture 
department 
hog producers have experienced a steep drop in returns over the 
past year but have made only a modest cutback in hog numbers the 
departments economic research service said thursday 
on june 1 the number of hogs kept for breeding was 3 percent 
below a year ago while market hogs those destined for slaughter 
were down only 1 percent and the report said producers expect to 
have about the same number of sows farrow this summer and next 
fall as they did last year 
commercial output of pork for all of 1989 was estimated at 159 
billion pounds up 2 percent from last year and the most since 1980 
market prices of hogs going to slaughter are expected to average 40 
to 43 per 100 pounds compared with 43 in 1988 
the allcut retail price of pork may be around 180 per pound in 
1989 down 3 to 5 cents per pound from last years average the 
report said 
beef production was projected at 228 billion pounds this year 
down 3 percent from 1988 production last month the agency forecast 
a 2 percent reduction in beef output 
prices of choicegrade steers are expected to average 71 to 74 
per 100 pounds compared with 70 in 1988 feeder steers may average 
about the same as last years 84 per hundredweight the report said 
the relatively high feeder cattle prices should provide an 
incentive for cowcalf producers to retain heifers to rebuild their 
breeding herds the report said 
as a result of smaller beef supplies average retail prices were 
forecast to rise 10 to 15 cents per pound on an allcut average 
from the 1988 level of 255 per pound 
relatively high returns are encouraging broiler producers to 
expand production by about 6 percent this year to 171 billion 
pounds the report said last months forecast was a 1989 increase 
of about 5 percent 
wholesale prices were forecast at 60 to 63 cents this year up 
from an average of 56 cents in 1988 
turkey output is expected to increase about 4 percent this year 
after a 6 percent increase in 1988 the june forecast indicated a 3 
percent increase wholesale turkey hen prices were indicated at 68 
to 71 cents per pound compared with 61 cents last year 
egg production may decline about 2 percent this year following a 
slight drop in 1988 the report said prices paid to producers were 
forecast at 73 to 76 cents per dozen up from 62 cents last year

when city people move to the suburbs they 
sometimes are bothered by pesky flies from a nearby farm and that 
could lead to bad feelings and even lawsuits says the agriculture 
department 
weve seen instances all over the country where urban 
encroachment in agricultural areas has caused problems for 
homeowners and agricultural producers says ralph a bram of the 
departments agricultural research service 
cities are sprawling into the countryside at the estimated rate 
of 900000 to 15 million acres a year he said thursday in an 
agency report and to newcomers flies and barnyard odors are not 
part of their idyllic country dream 
some flies can travel great distances from manure piles or other 
barnyard breeding places to find targets one kind the stable fly 
can migrate up to 135 miles 
bram is the national program leader for insects affecting humans 
at the agencys research facility in beltsville md 
we have to learn how to increase nonchemical fly control and 
how to make the same chemicals we have work better he said it 
goes beyond relying on screen doors sprays and swatters 
possible tactics include several nonchemical baits in traps to 
lure flies natural predators such as wasps that prey flies while in 
their pupa stage of development and natural organisms such as fungi 
and bacteria that attack flies in cattle feedlots 
the usda attack is directed at four main kinds of flies 
stable flies which have biting mouth parts and feed on blood 
house flies which secrete digestive enzymes onto their food 
then suck up both enzymes and food 
horn flies which bother only livestock on pastures and 
rangeland 
face flies also pests of livestock but an annoyance to 
homeowners in the fall 
stable flies and house flies from farms are the major problem 
species for homeowners said gustave d thomas an entomologist and 
research leader at the agencys midwest livestock insects research 
laboratory lincoln neb 
in the united states the stable fly is estimated to cost 400 
million annually in damage to cattle he said its hard to put 
a dollar value on the damage caused by the house fly but worldwide 
this fly may rank in the top 10 insect problems because it can 
transmit a lot of diseases

world oilseed production in 198990 is expected 
to be at a record level of around 2154 million metric tons up 8 
percent from last year says the agriculture department 
the us share is expected to be about 607 million tons up 21 
percent from last year most will be soybeans from the 1989 crop 
currently projected at 531 million tons or 195 billion bushels 
last years us soybean harvest was 419 million tons or 154 
billion bushels a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 
367 bushels of soybeans

a plan to provide condoms to san francisco 
jail inmates to prevent the spread of aids has been postponed for 
fear health workers could be prosecuted for permitting sex among 
prisoners 
we dont want to put our health educators at risk of being 
arrested even though some have said they are willing to go on the 
line beverly hayon an aide to city public health director david 
werdegar said thursday 
after two years of legal review sheriff mike hennessey approved 
a plan that would authorize distribution of condoms to inmates in 
three san francisco jails 
the proposal which had been scheduled to take effect today has 
been mired in legal uncertainty because engaging in sexual activity 
in jail is a felony in california any person who permits it could 
be charged with aiding and abetting illegal sexual activity 
authorities said 
the city health commission is scheduled to review the program 
tuesday hayon said 
if the commission endorses it despite the legal ambiguities 
well go for it she said 
in a letter to hennessey earlier this week san francisco 
district attorney arlo smith said anyone who distributes condoms 
would be at particular risk of liability 
smith said circumstances that would influence the chance of 
prosecution include the reasons for distribution the number of 
condoms issued and evidence of sexual conduct 
smith thinks its impossible to issue a legal opinion covering 
all situations and suggested hennessey seek a change in the law 
most of the nations prison officials ban condoms arguing that 
distribution would only encourage homosexual activity but vermont 
mississippi and new york city issue condoms to inmates 
hennessey insisted the primary purpose of condom distribution was 
to allow inmates to become familiar with the product without 
engaging in sexual activity 
its like drivers education he said you teach people to 
drive in a simulator 
but he acknowledged sexual activity occurs in jails and said 
inmates observed having sex would be booked and arrested 
if it is going to happen we would prefer it happened with a 
condom so disease is not spread he said 
under the program inmates would ask health educators for 
condoms which would be distributed one at a time if deemed 
medically appropriate after an interview with the inmate hennessey 
said 
condom distribution would be recorded in inmates confidential 
medical records he added

one week after a palestinian forced an 
israeli bus off a cliff the site of the attack and the assailants 
demolished home have become grim shrines representing both sides of 
the arab uprising 
hundreds of jews gathered for a memorial service thursday on the 
steep cliff where the bus plunged 200 feet into a gorge a 
tepeeshaped monument has been erected from stones charred tires 
and twisted metal 
dozens of israeli motorists stop on the jerusalemtel aviv 
highways shoulder to peer at the blackened mark where the bus went 
up in flames they leave behind a daily offering of flowers and 
blueandwhite israeli flags to memorialize the attack that killed 
14 people and injured 27 
in the gaza strip the impoverished nuseirat refugee camp has 
also become a shrine one that honors abdel hadi salman rassem 
ghanem 23 police and witnesses say ghanem forced bus no 405 off 
the road to avenge a friend who was shot by soldiers and paralyzed 
during the 19month palestinian uprising 
ghanems home has been demolished by the army as punishment for 
the attack 
but that has not erased his legend inscribed in graffiti on the 
walls of the camp ghanem who is hospitalized in a prison ward is 
considered a martyr because even though he did not die he was on a 
suicide mission 
to the hero abdel hadi the killer of the jews a salute of 
honor and glorification for the fighter abdel hadi said one 
slogan signed by islamic jihad a militant moslem group 
long live the hero abdel hadi symbol of sacrifice and 
redemption said another slogan signed by the plobacked united 
national leadership of the uprising 
at the jewish memorial service people gathered at the blackened 
spot where the bus burned picking through twisted steel and burned 
blankets they burned to death an elderly woman cried out 
several hundred people gathered on a cliff overlooking the crash 
site and beneath a sign that read enough terror a week earlier 
helicopters rescuing the wounded had perched on that same cliff 
this is the gate of heaven from here the holy ones went up to 
heaven said zvi rosenberg whose brother died in the attack 
legislators and clergymen delivered brief speeches as victims 
families wept quietly in the front row israeli flags fluttered in 
the breeze and youths lighted 14 torches for the victims 
transportation minister moshe katsav said the attack proved 
israelis are fighting a war for their existence 
this murder proves to everyone that there is no difference 
between terror and the intefadeh he said using the arabic word 
for uprising 
at least 560 palestinians and 35 israelis have died in the 
uprising that began against israeli rule on dec 8 1987 in the 
west bank and gaza strip which israel seized from jordan and egypt 
in the 1967 middle east war 
avner shaki minister of religion from the national religious 
party said the enlightened world the civilized world america 
european countries did not sound a clear condemnation of this vile 
murder 
israel was angered by the failure of the united states to 
immediately label the attack a terrorist act after protests the 
united states said it considered the attack terrorism 
earlier thursday the bus driver moshe elul told israel army 
radio he too had stopped on the roadside to reconstruct the moments 
when a palestinian wrenched the wheel from him and forced the bus 
over the cliff 
it helped me to go back over what happened to me in those few 
fateful moments i remember the angle of the bus as it fell down 
said elul who suffered head and neck injuries in the attack 
in nuseirat a wall left standing amidst the rubble that was once 
ghanems home is also sprayed with graffiti and slogans small 
posters bearing his picture are plastered around the camp home to 
30000 palestinian refugees 
ghanems wife nimaa 25 told the ap after the attack i think 
he is a hero and i am proud of what he did 
she gave birth to a boy the day before the bus attack 
he visited me wednesday night in the hospital to congratulate 
me and when i asked him where my present is he said it will be a 
big surprise she said 
i think he gave me the greatest present in history nimaa 
said adding that ghanem asked her to name the boy radwan after his 
paralyzed friend

the environmental protection agency is stepping 
in with everything but the money to clean up some of the 
worstpolluted military bases nuclear weapons plants and nuclear 
laboratories run by the government 
the epa announced thursday it plans to add 52 sites to its 
national priorities list the socalled superfund list of hazardous 
waste sites needing the most attention 
among the sites are wellknown laboratories and weapons materials 
plants such as fernald in ohio brookhaven in new york oak ridge in 
tennessee savannah river in south carolina and lawrence livermore 
in california military bases account for most of the 52 
estimates for cleaning up the radioactive and hazardous waste at 
all the department of energys nuclear facilities range from 80 
billion to 150 billion 
epa administrator william reilly said in a statement that many of 
the facilities are much larger and more complex than other 
superfund sites with wide varieties of hazardous and radioactive 
wastes 
epa in its superfund program can undertake cleanup activities 
and try to recover the costs from the corporate and other polluters 
when a federal agency gets on the list it must come up with cleanup 
funds out of its budget 
we have not engaged in budgeteering relating to these 
cleanups said jon cannon the assistant epa administrator in 
charge of the superfund when asked about the possible cost to 
taxpayers 
president bushs budget request for fiscal 1990 contains 500 
million for the defense department to clean up its hazardous sites 
although little money may be needed during the beginning 
assessment period which lasts up to two years the costs rise once 
cleanup begins cleanup must begin within 15 months after a plan is 
approved 
you will see budget demands ballooning in future years as 
remedies are selected and the cleanup process the expensive part of 
the process kicks in said cannon 
the epa intervention is nonetheless important cannon said 
the thing about the proposal is that it sets in motion a 
process whereby the federal facility is required to reach agreement 
with epa for cleanup he said once the site is listed it 
becomes a requirement of law that an interagency agreement be 
achieved that a schedule be set that an enforceable program be put 
in place 
the proposed additions to the list are followed by a period of 
public comment after which they become formal 
the 52 sites announced thursday are in 26 states california had 
the most sites 10 followed by alaska and florida each with 
four of the 52 sites 41 belonged to the department of defense 
nine to the energy department one to the transportation department 
and one to the federal aviation administration 
so far 12 of the does 17 nuclear weapons facilities have been 
proposed for the list or put on it 
the superfund list has 1224 hazardous waste sites 889 of which 
are final and 335 are proposed federal sites account for 115 of 
that total with 41 final and 74 proposed

the seven leaders of the worlds richest democracies 
will spend much of the weekend working in a cocoon of marblecovered 
concrete suspended more than 300 feet in the air 
that is if they dont mistake the openair elevator shafts or 
the tubular artworks adorning the site of the 15th economic summit 
for scaffolding left behind by the builders 
such is the design of la grande arche a 35story white marble 
structure that is one of the french capitals latest architectural 
outrages such is the location for the meetings that run from today 
through sunday 
in attendance will be president bush french president francois 
mitterrand canadian prime minister brian mulroney japanese prime 
minister sousuke uno west german chancellor helmut kohl great 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher and italys prime 
minister ciriaco de mita 
to imagine the structure picture a giant white cardboard box 
standing on its side with the top and bottom flaps folded in to 
form what looks like a deep glassless window frame 
the summit strategy sessions on third world debt the environment 
and aid for eastern europe will be held in the rooftop slab that 
hangs over a cavernous hollow huge enough to hold the notre dame 
cathedral including its spire 
to reach the summit in the sky the leaders will ride the bubble 
elevators that could easily be mistaken for construction staging 
should the statesmen suffer from vertigo they can ascend to the 
meetings through a disorienting expanse of stone stairs that stretch 
330 feet wide at the cubes base 
the arche is not quite finished and its inauguration was 
accelerated to accommodate the prestigious summit 
wittingly or not the planets most influential statesmen will 
serve as the guinea pigs for the controversial new structure which 
will eventually house the ministry of equipment and housing and an 
array of private companies 
hosting the financial summit in a previously unoccupied building 
may ease some security chores and avoid disruption of the business 
activities likely to bustle at the arche once its trapezoidal towers 
are replete with as many as 10000 office workers 
but christening the complex with such a highprofile event could 
also invite embarrassment or disaster 
on the eve of the summit electrical and plumbing problems 
disabled most of the highrises washrooms and elevators proved 
woefully inadequate for the 4500 journalists headquartered in the 
cube plastic dropcloths and wooden walkways still obscured much of 
the courtyard 
walls still needed paint and electricians worked hurriedly to 
test the elevators thursday under the watchful eye of dogs trained 
to detect explosives 
mitterrand personally chose the design submitted by late danish 
architect johan otto von spreckelsen in a 1983 international 
competition for the structure the president deemed the cubic entry 
an effort to unite technical prowess with purity of form 
but in emphasizing form over function the developers have drawn 
fire for what many see as more of an oddity than an artistic 
endeavor 
erected at the western extreme of an imaginary axis extending 
from the louvre through the arc de triomphe and along the champs 
elysees the modernistic marble monument completes the la defense 
cluster of contemporary office towers that many parisians consider a 
wart at the western edge of their revered city 
la defense a bluff beyond the seine and the bois de boulogne 
where the french held off german aggressors in the 1870 
francoprussian war has raised eyebrows and hackles since the first 
ultramodern structures took shape in the architectural 
expressiveness of the 1960s

a house bill to levy 50 million in new and 
increased licensing fees on many communications businesses would 
also ban obscene dialaporn services and restrict access to 
indecent phone messages 
the house energy and commerce committee approved the package on 
thursday while also voting to enact a new fairness doctrine that 
requires broadcasters to air opposing views on controversial public 
issues 
the committee action was part of a drive to hold the federal 
budget deficit in fiscal 1990 to 110 billion as required by the 
grammrudman deficitreduction law 
the committee attached the dialaporn and fairness doctrine 
measures to its budget reconciliation bill which is designed to 
generate 50 million through 
a 126 percent acrosstheboard increase in licensing fees 
charged by the federal communications commission 
new fees on 17 communications areas previously exempted from 
charges including ham radio operators and satellite launching 
businesses 
increases in fcc fines that have not been changed since 1934 
committee spokesman mike connolly said the vast majority of 
the 50 million will come from new fees with about a third of the 
money coming from private radio operations such a rural radio 
national paging services offshore radio and mobile and cellular 
phones 
minimum fees in nearly all cases will be 30 as opposed to 5 
currently the 70000 for satellites is the maximum other fees 
include a 6760 fee for a telephone company that requests an fcc 
hearing 
the dialaporn provision comes in response to a supreme court 
ruling last month that invalidated a 1988 law that had outlawed the 
2 billion dialaporn business 
the court said indecent speech was protected by the constitution 
but obscene speech was not 
the court since 1973 has defined obscenity as a work that is 
patently offensive prurient and has no serious literary artistic 
political or scientific value 
connolly said the committees action takes the ruling of the 
court and works with those constitutional restraints it bans 
obscene speech and it regulates indecent speech 
the bill requires telephone companies to block dialaporn calls 
to their customers lines unless a customer formally asks to have 
access to the service 
the dialaporn and licensing fee measures passed on voice votes 
but the fairness doctrine was added only after the committee voted 
358 against an amendment by rep tom tauke riowa to strip the 
provision from the bill 
tauke objected that the fairness doctrine a set of guidelines 
that were in effect since the 1940s before they were repealed by the 
fcc repealed in 1987 was unnecessary unconstitutional and made the 
bill veto bait at the white house 
the house and senate commerce committees both passed fairness 
doctrine bills in april 
president bush has indicated he would veto a fairness doctrine 
law and fairness doctrine proponents were not assured of enough 
votes to override a veto 
committee chairman john dingell dmich who has made the 
fairness doctrine a top legislative priority this year adopted the 
commonly used ploy of attaching a controversial measure to an 
important spending bill 
the committee feels its doubtful president bush would veto the 
entire reconciliation package over fairness connolly said

people in kentucky are bad about smoking but good 
about not drinking and driving most hawaiians buckle up and montana 
residents arent a sedentary lot a health survey shows 
the national centers for disease control asked people in 32 
states and the district of columbia about their exercise habits 
their drinking their driving and their efforts to ward off heart 
disease breast cancer and the flu 
the survey taken in 1987 and released thursday is the latest of 
the cdcs behavioral risk factor surveys an effort to find out 
what americans do to ruin their health 
the survey found a wide variety of healthrelated behavior from 
statetostate it also found variations in the use of precautions 
such as cholesterol checks mammograms and flu vaccinations 
weve seen that risktaking behavior varies a lot said dr 
robert anda a specialist in health risks with the atlantabased cdc 
he cited several possible reasons for the differences 
it could be socioeconomic factors it could be that the quality 
of medical care may vary from state to state or the availability 
or access he said prevention has not had the emphasis it needs 
in this country 
in the survey the widest variance in unhealthy behavior was the 
use of seat belts 72 percent of the south dakotans surveyed 
reported that they did not usually wear seat belts while just 7 
percent of hawaiians fell in that category 
but most of the nation seems agreed on a distaste for exercise 
in all but three states more than half the respondents said they 
led sedentary lives not engaging in thriceweekly exercise 
sessions of 20 minutes or more 
a look at the surveys other highs and lows 
smoking ranged from 323 percent in kentucky to 15 percent in 
utah 
montana reported the fewest with sedentary lifestyles 472 
percent and new york the most with 735 percent 
binge drinking more than four drinks in one sitting in the 
last month was reported by 294 percent in wisconsin and just 66 
percent in new mexico 
heavier drinking 60 or more drinks a month ranged from 
37 percent in west virginia to 103 percent in new hampshire 
drinking and driving defined as getting behind the wheel after 
too much to drink ranged from 83 percent in wisconsin to 13 
percent in kentucky 
in maryland 568 percent of those surveyed had had a 
cholesterol check while in new mexico it was just 293 
in new hampshire 575 percent of the women surveyed had had a 
mammogram compared with 346 percent in nebraska 
and while 413 percent of those 65 and older in montana had 
gotten their flu shots for the year just 24 percent of those in 
rhode island did the same

alaskas governor and house representative say 
legislation to cancel sweetheart deals two companies have to cut 
timber in alaskas huge tongass national forest forest is a case of 
environmentalists going too far 
the bill approved thursday by a 35660 vote would terminate 
50year contracts with the louisiana pacificketchikan and the 
alaska pulp co a japanese firm in the southeastern alaskan forest 
proponents claim the companies have abused their special 
relationship and stifled competition from other companies while 
getting trees at bargainbasement prices 
rep george miller dcalif called the timber contracts a 
raid on taxpayers 
the federal government has spent 362 million on tongass timber 
subsidies since 1982 said miller but because the government 
has assessed the value of the trees at rates set in 1956 the us 
treasury has received only 39 million on its 362 million 
investment 
the size of west virginia and delaware combined the forest is 
treasured by environmentalists as a habitat for grizzly bear and 
bald eagles and contains the largest spawning area for salmon 
its also one of two remaining sections of a rain forest that 
once extended northward from northern california and is considered 
an important protection against global warming 
but alaskan officials say the vote ignored the states interests 
todays house action is an unfortunate case of congressmen from 
outside alaska voting on the livelihoods of alaskans gov steve 
cowper said alaskans deserve better and i suspect well get it 
when this measure reaches the senate 
republican rep don young alaskas lone representative in the 
house said the vote demonstrated the power of environmentalists who 
ignore the need of alaskans to find jobs he claims 6000 jobs would 
be lost if the lumber companies go out of business 
im terribly disappointed he said 
proponents say competition would be enhanced however 
if we cancel these contracts it doesnt drive the timber 
industry out of alaska said robert mrazek dny cosponsor of 
the bill it simply puts these companies on the same footing as 
other companies 
young cowper and many members of congress including agriculture 
committee chairman kika de la garza dtexas favor a version that 
would have called for renegotiation rather than cancellation of the 
timber contracts the agriculture committee oversees the forest 
service 
but that version was rejected 269144 on thursday 
young said if the bill is not changed in the senate it will be 
vetoed by president bush 
agriculture secretary clayton yeutter has already said he would 
recommend a veto of legislation that called for termination of the 
contracts 
the house interior committee whose chairman rep morris udall 
dariz vowed nine years ago to end the 50year contracts is also 
trying to attach the bill to deficitreducing legislation which 
staff members believe would have better chance of becoming law 
by repealing a 40 million annual appropriation that aided the 
lumber companies the tongass timber reform act would save the 
federal government almost 200 million over five years after 
subtracting added expenses the bill creates 
the legislation also would designate 23 areas as wilderness 
barring timber harvesting and development on 18 million acres and 
ban logging within 100 feet of salmon streams

a rosy likeness of rock n roll king elvis 
presley will appear on mississippis entry in the tournament of 
roses parade on new years day after all 
barry ward a memphis tenn attorney representing presleys 
estate said thursday that an earlier decision against allowing use 
of the likeness had been reversed the mississippi parade entry is 
planned as a tribute to the magnolia states musicians 
the estate does not like normally to have elvis associated 
with any other artists ward said the other artists that are 
going to be featured on the float are outstanding in their field 
even though it was a different field from elvis 
with the floral bust of the tupeloborn rocker will be likenesses 
of bluesman bb king opera diva leontyne price and country singer 
tammy wynette 
ward said the original decision was reconsidered because of the 
floats importance to mississippi and mississippians 
were celebrating around the office said pat frascogna 
chairwoman of the mississippi float committee ive never seen 
anything change so fast in my life we were dismayed at their 
earlier decision 
her organization the nonprofit mississippi tournament of roses 
association will launch the float in the 1990 parade 
the reversal ended a frantic search for an elvis replacement 
choices included louisiana native jerry lee lewis who now lives in 
mississippi and jimmy buffet conway twitty charlie pride jimmie 
rodgers and bobbie gentry 
the 102500 float was already under construction in pasadena 
calif where the parade is held 
the presley estates initial refusal outraged some mississippians 
and sparked a jackson radio stations letterwriting campaign 
intended to shame estate representatives into changing their minds

a houstonarea lawyer is barred from doing 
business with the federal government because he was slow in turning 
over some 15 million from sales of property owned by the 
department of housing and urban development 
we have not kept any money larry e thomas who had worked 
as a private closing agent for hud said thursday 
a hud official wayne sevier in the departments fort worth 
office confirmed that practically all of the money has been 
recovered 
the department which estimates it has lost about 20 million 
from closing agents who sold hud property and kept the money sent 
thomas a letter two weeks ago telling him he cant do any more work 
for the government 
the ban applies to all agencies of the executive branch of 
government the letter said 
in recent years hud hired private contractors including thomas 
to handle the paperwork for closing the sales of property the 
department took over through foreclosure once the sale is closed 
the agents are to turn over the money to the federal treasury by 
wire within a few days 
thomas speaking in a telephone interview from missouri city 
texas acknowledged he had been late in giving the money to the 
department sometimes by months but said it was due to one 
paperwork problem or another 
whether its late or whether he didnt plan to do it who 
knows said sevier anyway its been turned over to our 
inspector general and possibly to justice the justice department 
for action 
thomas said he did not profit by hanging onto the money because 
it had been kept in an account that did not bear interest 
the only reason that there would be any delay would be because 
of the incorrect reporting of the taxes that we might receive from 
the tax people that we use here or inhouse missed communications 
over at the department getting them signed in the right amount of 
time thomas said 
thomas said he was not surprised to be slapped with a ban on 
doing contract work for the government because of all the attention 
that has been focused on closing agents and other scandals at hud 
one former closing agent marilyn harrell of maryland has become 
the most widely known because of her nickname robin hud given 
because she said she used some of her stolen money to help buy 
houses and cars for the poor in all she admits stealing more than 
5 million

democratic leaders want to quickly outlaw flag 
burning without changing the constitution but congressional 
conservatives are promising to fight any footdragging on their 
proposed constitutional amendment 
rep don edwards dcalif the chairman of the house judiciary 
constitutional law subcommittee said thursday legislation would 
probably reach the house floor before congress august recess to 
overturn the supreme court decision 
but he said it probably wouldnt be the constitutional amendment 
supported by president bush edwards said the proposed amendment 
might be reckless in its current form because it doesnt detail 
what would constitute desecration of the flag or shape the penalties 
edwards and other key democrats including house speaker thomas 
s foley dwash house judiciary committee chairman jack brooks 
dtexas and senate judiciary committee chairman joseph biden 
ddel propose regular legislation designed to meet the courts 
concerns 
but in the senate republicans are insisting the amendment 
doesnt get secondclass treatment and house republicans say they 
can force their amendment out of committee if the panel tries to 
hold it up 
republicans and some democratic conservatives say the 
constitutional amendment is the only way to ensure the court ruling 
is overturned 
even experts who do not favor a constitutional amendment 
approach say that a legislative approach would not work house 
republican leader bob michel rill told edwards subcommittee on 
thursday as congressional hearings on the flag issue began 
rep sonny montgomery dmiss the chairman of the house 
veterans affairs committee called for passage of the amendment 
without it he said people will be burning flags throughout the 
country on every holiday occasion drawing strong reactions 
especially from veterans 
people are going to get hurt he said 
while many liberals object entirely to a flag constitutional 
amendment as a threat to the bill of rights biden told the panel he 
would support an amendment if a simple statute didnt work but he 
said a statute could enacted far more quickly since it doesnt 
require ratification by the states 
biden who plans to begin hearings in his committee soon decried 
those who were trying to take political advantage of the flag ruling 
the easiest thing in the world to demagogue is the flag said 
the former presidential candidate 
michel who appeared alongside montgomery insisted it was not a 
partisan issue and he said those who feared weakening of free speech 
rights were wrong 
i have more faith in the strength of the constitution and in 
the common sense of the american people than to believe that the 
first amendment can be weakened by protecting the flag he said 
sen howard metzenbaum dohio said the push for a 
constitutional amendment was being driven by politics and not any 
threat to this nations values or security 
we are engaged in a crude form of political oneupmanship a 
crass competition about who loves the flag more with a cold eye 
toward the next election he said

house taxwriters want millions of people who 
deduct consumer interest to give up the writeoff a year earlier so 
bankers and corporate executives may keep a special tax benefit of 
their own 
that unusual tradeoff has been written by the house ways and 
means committee into a bill designed to raise 53 billion in new 
revenue for deficit reduction during the budget year that begins 
oct 1 
the committee also signaled thursday that it is likely to 
recommend significant changes in the surtax that finances 
catastrophic health insurance for older americans aides said there 
also is considerable sentiment to make some cut in the capital gains 
tax although not necessarily as president bush has recommended 
but on a 2511 vote the committee rejected a plan by rep bill 
archer rtexas to tackle the catastrophic and capital gains issues 
together his amendment would have delayed for one year the medicare 
surtax on older americans and used a lower capital gains tax to pay 
for the bulk of the insurance program 
committee aides said the panel is likely to make some change in 
the catastrophic insurance tax next week congress has been flooded 
with mail from older americans with higher incomes who now must pay 
a surtax of up to 800 this year for federal insurance against costs 
of catastrophic illness 
it is far from certain the aides added that the capital gains 
tax will be cut many democrats are opposed because the bulk of the 
benefit would go to highincome taxpayers 
the bush administration contends a capital gains tax cut which 
affects profits from stocks and other assets would raise money and 
thus could be used to reduce the deficit congressional economists 
insist it would lose money after the first year 
by a voice vote the panel eliminated from the deficitreduction 
package an increase in taxes on snuff and pipe and chewing tobacco 
the three products would have been taxed at 267 a pound snuff now 
is taxed at 24 cents pipe tobacco at 45 cents and chewing tobacco 
at 8 cents 
in place of those increases the committee agreed to speed up 
collection of taxes from dividends received from mutual funds 
the biggest single revenueraiser affecting corporations that 
use employee stockownership plans to avoid takeover and banks that 
lend to esops was scaled back it was to finance part of that 
scaleback that the committee agreed to a quicker phaseout of the 
itemized deduction for consumer interest 
only 20 percent of interest on loans for automobiles education 
and credit cards is deductible under present law that is scheduled 
to drop next year to 10 percent under the committees action the 
interest deduction would die at the end of this year 
about 24 million couples and individuals take a deduction for 
consumer interest 
the committee wants to reduce two existing tax benefits connected 
with esops under which workers are given shares of the companies 
where they are employed 
under the committees action thursday a bank that lends money to 
finance an esop purchase of stock could continue avoiding tax on 
half the interest earned from such loans only if the esop owns 30 
percent or more of the corporation the same 30 percent test would 
be applied before a corporation could take a tax deduction for 
certain dividends paid on esop stock 
a second change would make the new rule effective on july 10 
this change would allow dozens of corporations that are setting up 
esops to qualify for treatment under the old rules

beer ads on television should be regulated so 
youngsters are not encouraged to drink an advocacy group says but 
the beer industry contends its up to parents to keep an eye on 
their kids viewing habits 
the center for science in the public interest said thursday that 
in an informal survey it conducted television ads for beer were 
more popular than any other type of commercial among teenage boys 
forty percent of the highschool boys surveyed said one or more 
beer ads were their favorites of the girls surveyed 12 percent 
listed beer and wine ads as their favorites 
michael jacobson executive director of the washingtonbased 
center said the ads have an impact regardless of beer industry 
claims that they dont target youngsters 
intentions aside their advertising is sure reaching these 
kids and thats really the issue he said 
jim sanders president of the beer institute said i dont 
believe this particular survey reveals anything more than parental 
neglect 
other surveys have shown no correlation between advertising and 
increased consumption sanders said the competition within the 
industry is for a market that has leveled off he said 
jacobson said the survey showed that advertisements for fast 
foods and soft drinks as well as beer are popular with teenagers 
its high time that society either restricted such ads or made 
sure that messages for a more healthful lifestyle reached kids he 
said 
boys and girls agreed on what made an ad attractive he said 
those characteristics were humor rock music and the depiction of 
athletes or other sports activities 
in fact the single favorite ad among boys was for isuzu cars and 
trucks followed by budweiser or bud light the single favorite 
among girls was mcdonalds followed by pepsi or diet pepsi 
the students in the survey were questioned this spring at public 
and private high schools in washington baltimore and rural 
pennsylvania the washingtonbased center said the 284 responding 
students listed a total of 1026 favorite or most memorable ads 
the students average age was 157 years

senate sponsors of a planned overhaul of the 
nations immigration system including a cap of 630000 immigrants 
arriving each year are predicting a strong chance of approval in 
the house 
im very hopeful that well get legislation its early in the 
session sen edward m kennedy dmass said thursday after the 
senate approved the measure 8117 and sent it to the house 
the bill was originally designed to cap immigration at 600000 in 
each of the next three years but was expanded to include room for 
30000 new arrivals annually before final passage the ceiling 
represents 136000 more visas than were issued last year 
critics say the bill still could reduce visas for all but the 
closest relatives of american citizens and permanent residents of 
the united states 
the house killed a similar measure in 1988 but sponsors are more 
hopeful about their chances this year 
kennedy and cosponsor alan k simpson rwyo said they have 
already received encouragement from house leaders 
weve never given them anything like this this early simpson 
said 
simpson expressed concerns about changes the bill underwent 
before passage but said it was time to face the unfortunate but 
hideously cold reality that there are many more people who want to 
come here than there is room or intent to accommodate them 
simpson praised provisions that reserved 120000 of the annual 
visas for individuals who do not have family ties in america but who 
would be likely to make significant contributions in business 
sciences or other areas 
the senate added a provision that would allow entry to spouses 
and minor children of those who achieved legal status under the 1986 
amnesty program for illegal aliens 
the thrust of the bill does not relate to illegal aliens but the 
senate attached a number of riders that focused on the politically 
volatile subject 
the senate voted 7821 to raise the ceiling by 30000 visas 
annually after sen arlen specter rpa recalled how his father 
fled czarist russia in 1911 and arrived in america with no rubles 
in his pocket he had to come steerage 
further efforts at expansion however were rejected 
the senate did approve an amendment from sen richard c shelby 
dala that would force the census bureau to halt its practice of 
including illegal aliens in its official count proponents were 
concerned that states with many aliens would get an unfair edge in 
congressional remaps following next years census 
sen jesse helms rnc said that under the current system 
states like california would gain a congressional seat at north 
carolinas expense 
among those entering for reasons other than family ties 54000 
visas annually are subject to a point system giving credit for those 
with special skills who do not have employers ready to sponsor them 
the judiciary committee deleted a provision that would provide 
extra points to individuals who speak english simpson appealed to 
the senate in vain to restore the point system but lawmakers 
rejected the idea 5643 
meanwhile the house approved 35844 and sent to the senate 
separate legislation to ease immigration of certain soviet and 
southeast asian refugees 
it would temporarily reestablish the legal status of soviet jews 
and evangelical christians as well as certain categories of 
vietnamese laotians and cambodians as persecuted without having to 
prove it in each individual case that would aid them in obtaining 
standing as refugees 
the measure is opposed by the bush administration which contends 
it unnecessarily establishes special preferences for certain 
refugees and makes it more difficult to fairly administer the us 
refugee program

next weeks update of the projected federal 
deficit for fiscal 1990 once seen on capitol hill as ominous is 
now viewed by lawmakers as a harmless exercise that may even make 
their budget work easier 
many members of congress say they believe the white houses 
office of management and budget is likely to forecast a deficit that 
falls below the 110 billion target set in the grammrudman 
balancedbudget law 
my best estimate is that omb will come in with a set of numbers 
indicating well easily achieve the 110 billion sen pete v 
domenici of new mexico ranking republican on the senate budget 
committee said thursday 
i would not even be surprised if the assumptions would yield 
closer to 100 billion than 110 billion he said 
domenici who consults regularly with bush administration 
officials said his comments were based on an informed guess 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the house budget 
committee said he believes the deficit will probably be projected 
very close to earlier estimates that the grammrudman target 
would be honored 
im not expecting any big surprises he said 
failure to meet the grammrudman ceiling can trigger automatic 
spending slashes in most domestic and defense federal programs 
fiscal 1990 begins oct 1 
domenici panetta and others on capitol hill said they expect omb 
to concede that next years economy is likely to be less robust than 
the agency projected in february 
a worsening economy tends to increase interest rates the 
government pays to borrowers and diminish the revenues it collects 
driving up the deficit 
but the lawmakers said that could be more than compensated for by 
higher than anticipated revenue collections by the government as 
well as some spending savings 
domenici indicated that omb could claim 10 billion more in 
revenue than was expected in february 3 billion in savings from 
the way the savings and loan industry bailout is being handled and 
perhaps 1 billion in savings from changes in defense spending 
omb officials wouldnt comment on the forecast 
in other budget action thursday 
the house energy and commerce committee imposed federal 
communications commission fees on amateur radio operators 
nationwide paging services and other radio frequency users raising 
an estimated 50 million 
the panel also wrote new restrictions on dialaporn companies 
and voted to write the fairness doctrine into law the doctrine 
enforced by the fcc until 1987 requires broadcasters to grant equal 
time to all sides of issues 
the senate banking committee took credit for saving 187 million 
by renewing the governments floodinsurance program the program is 
to expire sept 30 which would leave about 2 million policyholders 
eligible to receive benefits but not required to pay premiums 
the senate governmental affairs committee approved legislation 
moving the moneylosing postal service offbudget and changing 
the way the service pays health benefits to families of former 
employees pensions and other retirement payments the package 
claims 29 billion in savings 
the senate veterans affairs committee extended a fee it charges 
for loans and retained restrictions on the loan portfolios it sells 
claiming a savings of 665 million the house veterans affairs 
committee took similar action that it said saved 697 million 
ombs deficit projections assume enactment of savings in the 
117 trillion budget passed by congress in may congressional 
committees are beginning work on the spending revenue and savings 
bills needed to carry out the deficit reduction envisioned in the 
budget 
the congressional budget planned a deficit of 1054 billion in 
fiscal 1990 the spending plan reflected an agreement worked out in 
april between president bush and congressional leaders

china said today it was imposing tougher rules on 
what books and magazines can publish and there were reports of more 
executions and prison terms in a continuation of the governments 
drive to stifle popular dissent 
a foreign source in chengdu the capital of central sichuan 
province quoted local press reports as saying two men were executed 
last saturday for their actions during deadly riots in that city in 
early june 
the executions which were not reported in the national press 
brought to 29 the number of people known to have been put to death 
for disrupting social order since the june 34 military assault on 
beijing in which at least 200 people were killed 
meanwhile the official peoples daily said today that the state 
press and publications administration has decided to take tough new 
measures to weed out publications it considers unsavory 
it said publishers in recent years have flooded the book market 
with low grade and vulgar material which contain violent murders and 
obscene pornography which have corrupted peoples souls 
it added that books and periodicals to be investigated and 
removed from bookstalls include those with counterrevolutionary 
and bourgeois liberalization propaganda 
the chinese government has blamed the june violence on 
counterrevolutionary rebels trying to overthrow the socialist 
system and has detained or issued arrest warrants for dozens of 
students and intellectuals who led the prodemocracy movement 
books by scholars now on nationwide wanted lists have been 
banned and culture ministry workers have raided private bookstalls 
to seize copies 
the administration said any bookseller or publisher who violates 
the regulations will be fined at least five times the profit made 
the chengdu source said the two executed men zhou xiangcheng and 
wang guiyuan were charged with beating smashing looting and 
burning a catchall of crimes that china uses for rioting neither

the chengdu riots of june 45 are believed to be the most violent 
that occurred outside the capital up to 30 people were killed as 
people battled police and a halfblock of the city was destroyed by 
fire more than 100 people were later arrested 
the source said chengdu courts also gave another man a death 
sentence with a twoyear reprieve and sentenced three others to life 
imprisonment one for arson and two for hooliganism the 
twoyear stay of execution means the sentence is converted to life 
if the prisoner shows a proper attitude 
the source said courts in chengdu the past week have sentenced 20 
others to prison terms ranging from five years to life 
in the first weeks following the violence in beijing chinas 
national media reported the arrests of more than 2000 people who 
took part in protests the arrests still are believed to be going 
on although the national press rarely reports them now

worker being given a 10year prison term for spreading rumors during 
an interview with abctv 
the interview in which xiao bin 42 of dalian told abc that 
20000 people were killed by troops during their attack on tiananmen 
square apparently was intercepted by china central television when 
abc was sending the unedited tape by satellite 
china tv broadcast the tape and demanded that people turn the man 
in two women reported xiao to police and later received cash 
rewards

against the sound of furious politicians from 
president bush on down calling for a constitutional amendment 
protecting old glory sen howard metzenbaum seeks silence 
the ohio democrat is going out of his way to try to convince his 
colleagues to leave the constitution alone 
compared to the events that have shaped the constitution the 
burning of the flag in texas by an obscure protestor was a blip on 
the screen of history metzenbaum told members of a house 
subcommittee thursday 
but we will magnify it a thousandfold if it stampedes us into 
eroding the majesty of the constitution he said we must not 
turn this foolish offensive act into an historic event 
metzenbaum didnt seem to make any headway 
the house judiciary subcommittee on civil and constitutional 
rights remained focused on taking flag desecration off the list of 
protected forms of political dissent the issue for the panel isnt 
whether to reverse a recent supreme court ruling but how to go 
about it 
the political outcry came after the supreme court ruled last 
month that the 1984 conviction of a man who burned a flag in a 
dallas protest was unconstitutional because his actions were covered 
by first amendment guarantees of freedom of speech 
metzenbaum acknowledged hes up against a political tidal 
wave but said he felt obliged to wade in i would hope the 
congress would have backbone and will not try to change the bill of 
rights he said 
even with action scheduled on the other side of capitol hill on 
one of his pet projects metzenbaum sat patiently in the house 
hearing room listening to more than an hour of speeches analysis 
and dire predictions of the foul things that could happen without a 
strong flag protection measure 
when he got his turn metzenbaum stuck to his script reading 
slowly and calmly as he urged restraint 
he evoked images of the excessive government reaction to 
political protest in china and told the panel it is the right to 
protest even when it is offensive that makes us different from the 
rest of the world 
is the political breastbeating on this issue based on a real 
concern about a threat to this nations values or security no 
metzenbaum told the committee we are engaged in a crude form of 
political oneupmanship a crass competition about who loves the 
flag more 
during times of heated passions our national leaders should 
call forth the best in us the love of freedom that has made us the 
model for the world he said the flag dispute has instead 
reduced the political debate to shameful and crass demagoguery 
if the forces behind the amendment drive were offended they 
didnt let on 
rep jim sensenbrenner of wisconsin the ranking republican on 
the subcommittee and one of the loudest proamendment voices 
complimented metzenbaums testimony 
you have taken an intellectually honest approach for one who is 
on the other side he said

the b2 stealth bomber is ready to fly 
after successfully completing ground tests and takeoff could come 
as early as saturday the air force says 
the batwinged aircraft sped down a desert runway thursday 
hitting a top speed of 132 mph and lifting its nose wheel off the 
tarmac said brig gen richard scofield director of the b2 
program 
weve completed all the taxi tests prior to going to first 
flight scofield said the airplane is in good shape 
the bomber in development for more than a decade has been 
subjected to extensive computersimulated flights but has never 
actually lifted off a runway 
it incorporates revolutionary technologies and the use of 
lightweight composite material to elude radar by absorbing radar 
energy rather than reflecting it as conventional aircraft do 
but although the bomber appears ready to fly congressional 
opposition to the costly defense program threatens to ground the b2 
just as it is rising to prove its secret capabilities 
congressmen warned air force officials earlier this week that 
they face a tough uphill fight with the b2 which recent estimates 
indicate would be the most expensive aircraft in history 
put it in perspective or theres a real possibility that the 
b2 will become a museum piece said rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee 
on thursday defense secretary dick cheney pleaded with congress 
not to nickel and dime to death the b2 saying the bomber is 
essential for us forces to penetrate improving soviet air 
defenses 
testifying before the house armed services committee cheney 
urged lawmakers to try to overcome sticker shock at the 500 
million to 750 million price for each plane and to restore 800 
million the panel cut from the b2 budget last month 
at air force plant 42 in palmdale scofield refused to be drawn 
into the political debate telling reporters im working on the 
airplane end of the thing and the airplane is doing just fine 
scofield said engineers from northrop corp which designed and 
built the b2 and air force officials would spend at least one day 
evaluating data gathered during thursdays ground tests 
we will have to see what the data tells us the general said 
well be working on a number of issues 
nevertheless he made clear that northrop and air force officials 
believe they have all the data they need to send the bomber airborne 
after maintaining for years that the b2 didnt exist the air 
force invited the media and dignitaries to a comingout ceremony 
last november 
last week the pentagon announced the first flight tests of the 
bomber 18 months behind schedule would be held during the next 
two weeks 
the pentagon is proposing a 47 billion budget in fiscal 1990 
for the b2 manufactured by northrop in palmdale the plane will 
cost about 24 billion over a threeyear peak period beginning in 
fiscal 1992 according to defense department figures 
the department has invested about 224 billion in the plane so 
far

defense secretary dick cheney is asking 
congress not to nickel and dime to death the b2 stealth bomber 
cheneys plea was the latest in a defense department offensive to 
try to convince skeptical lawmakers to overcome the sticker 
shock over the expensive radarevading plane and look instead at 
its strategic value 
its time that we move this debate from the question of 
simple cost to one of strategic value he told the house armed 
services committee thursday 
the b2 is an essential addition to our strategic bomber 
force if we are to have confidence in our ability to penetrate 
improving soviet air defenses in the late 1990s and beyond he 
said 
the defense secretary spoke as both the senate and house moved 
toward showdowns on the planes place in president bushs request 
for a 2956 billion pentagon budget next year 
the senate armed services committee met behind closed doors 
thursday to write its own version of a defense budget which was 
expected to be revealed today 
concerned about the price tag of 500 million to 1 billion for 
each plane making it the most expensive bomber in history the 
house panel last month cut some 800 million from the b2 budget 
a prototype of the plane made its first taxi tests in palmdale 
calif earlier this week but has yet to make its maiden flight the 
plane successfully completed final ground tests thursday taxiing at 
speeds up to 75 mph in preparation for a maiden flight that could 
come as early as saturday 
recent figures have indicated that 23 billion has been spent on 
the b2 so far much of it in secrecy and there are estimates that 
it will cost an additional 50 billion through the late 1990s 
cheney told the house committee he could not guarantee against 
cost increases but said most of the major technical and cost overrun 
problems of the past are under control 
the house panel over the vehement objections of its chairman 
last month cut the administrations request for the b2 from 47 
billion to 39 billion while restoring 300 million for a vertical 
takeoff plane and the f14d fighter jet that bush and cheney wanted 
to scuttle 
the chairman rep les aspin dwis and the committees ranking 
republican rep william dickinson of alabama prepared an amendment 
thursday attempting to restore some of b2 money but acknowledged 
the plane is in trouble because of its cost 
with 23 billion already sunk into the b2 including work on 11 
planes for development and testing cutting its funds now amounts 
to eating our seed corn said cheney 
you do have to make that choice cheney added indicating 
bluntly that he would prefer an eitheror decision to stop the plane 
entirely or proceed with it on the administrations schedule 
what you shouldnt do is nickel and dime it to death he said

scientists detected new volcanic tremors and a weak 
earthquake in the area where an undersea volcano spewed water and 
smoke the previous night and the government warned another eruption 
appeared imminent 
the governments coordinating committee for earthquake prediction 
said an eruption is highly likely to recur not only at the same 
spot but possibly other locations it said it was broadcasting 
emergency warnings and news on significant developments to local 
families 
most of the 200 residents in ito who had left their seaside 
houses about 60 miles southwest of tokyo to spend the night in 
buddhist temples and schools returned home today but 43 schools 
closed amid the uncertainty said masaaki mitsuhashi a spokesman 
for the resort city of 72000 people 
although there is no immediate danger we have eight places 
ready for evacuees just in case anything worse happens he added 
no injuries or damage have been reported from thursday nights 
eruption but 21 people suffered minor injuries sunday when two 
earthquakes measuring 55 on the richter scale hit the area 
since june 30 about 22300 quakes including 480 large enough to 
be felt by humans have been recorded off ito and parts of nearby 
izu peninsula 
the central meteorological agency said new volcanic tremors were 
measured at 247 am today lasting about 87 minutes and at 1142 
am lasting about three minutes 
the volcano erupted about 330 feet undersea at about 630 pm 
thursday about 8000 feet northeast of teishijima an uninhabited 
islet the agency said 
while water rose about 100 feet in the air no dangerous waves 
hit the shore 
maritime safety agency officials passing nearby on a patrol boat 
told kyodo news service today they were extremely scared when 
they heard a noise that sounded as though a huge hammer had hit the 
bottom of the vessel and something was pushing the boat from below 
we still have not confirmed whether the eruption formed a new 
volcanic mountain under the ocean but a new piece of ground might 
appear out of the ocean said a central meteorological official 
this morning scores of dead fish and stones of volcanic origin 
were found scattered on the ito shore mitsuhashi said 
chief cabinet secretary masajuro shiokawa and national land 
agency director eiji nonaka called today for measures to protect 
local residents 
daisuke shimozuru chairman of the earthquake prediction 
committee told a news conference thursday night that recent quakes 
in the area probably have been caused by magma or molten rock 
under the ocean floor 
large magma movements can cause earthquakes which often precede 
volcanic eruptions 
the japanese archipelago which is of volcanic origin is 
believed to have about 80 active volcanoes in january mount 
tokachi on japans northernmost island of hokkaido erupted several 
times

an organization of american states 
mission has arrived in panama for a third attempt to find a solution 
to the countrys electoral crisis 
we came here to get a clear view of the situation oas 
secretary general joao baena soares said late thursday 
the oas mission arrived only hours after the opposition rejected 
the latest government proposal for a junta to take over on sept 1 
the constitutional inauguration day 
international observers say the opposition led by presidential 
candidate guillermo endara won the may 7 national elections by a 31 
margin the opposition wants its victory recognized 
the government controlled by gen manuel antonio noriega head of 
the defense forces and panamas de facto ruler annulled the 
election on may 10 
in addition to having its victory recognized the opposition 
wants noriega to resign something the united states has sought 
since last year 
we feel that our proposal for a threeway negotiation involving 
the government the opposition and the military has been accepted 
another member of the oas mission ecuadoran foreign minister diego 
cordovez said the important thing is to clear up details for a 
negotiation 
the mission is to meet with government officials and opposition 
leaders and then submit a report to the oas in washington on july 19 
endara said last week that he has been disappointed with the oas 
efforts so far 
the opposition had expected the oas negotiators to put more 
pressure the government to enter negotiations that include noriega 
the united states which says noriega is a drugtrafficking 
dictator has thrown its support behind the opposition by imposing 
economic sanctions on panama 
noriega says the united states which indicted him last year on 
drugtrafficking charges is trying to set the stage to renege on 
the 1977 treaties that hand the panama canal over to panama at the 
end of the century

the mozambican government has approved 
a peace plan involving negotiations with the guerrillas to end the 
countrys 12year civil war the top us official on african policy 
said 
herman cohen assistant secretary of state for african affairs 
made the announcement thursday at the zambian presidents safari 
lodge after meeting with mozambiques president joaquim chissano 
cohen ending a weeklong tour of africa headed today to 
portugal mozambiques former colonial ruler 
briefing kenneth kaunda at the presidents lodge in eastern 
zambia cohen said chissano had received the approval of the central 
committee of the ruling party to engage in a fullfledged peace 
process through negotiations over the conflict in his country 
he has asked the united states to be helpful and we have agreed 
to do whatever he thinks we should do to contribute to this 
process cohen said 
earlier at maputo airport cohen said chissano indicated he might 
ask the united states to meet with the guerrillas and that such a 
request would be seriously considered 
kaunda said he would be willing to meet in confidence with 
fw de klerk the leader of the ruling national party in south 
africa and designated to be the countrys next president before or 
after the south african parliamentary elections in september de 
klerk would not become president until september when he is 
virtually certain to succeed pw botha 
kaunda has previously said he would be willing to meet de klerk 
after south africa granted independence to namibia whose elections 
are not scheduled until november 
kaunda did not give a reason for offering to move up a proposed 
meeting with de klerk but he welcomed the meeting last week between 
botha and nelson mandela the imprisoned leader of the african 
national congress which has its exile headquarters in zambia 
kaunda said he would also encourage the anc which has been 
waging intermittent guerrilla attacks in south africa since 1961 to 
talk to the south african government 
cohen praised kaunda for offering to meet de klerk whom cohen 
had talked to early this month he said de klerk was a man who is 
willing to listen to ideas 
i believe it is important the he listen not only to the ideas 
of prime minister margaret thatcher and west german chancellor 
helmut kohl but that he also talks to african leaders because he 
is an african and has to find african solutions to the problems of 
south africa cohen said 
i am persuaded that the president truly seeks to resolve the 
conflict through a political settlement he said 
it is now important for renamo the portuguese acronym for the 
guerrilla organization to reciprocate by accepting the principle 
that no group in mozambique should seek to impose its will on the 
people or government through use of force or violence cohen said 
chissano indicated that the united states could play a role in 
facilitating the peace process we agree to play a role and will 
continue discussions to decide how this can best be carried out 
the us official added 
the national news agency aim said cohen made it clear that the 
united states role would be on the side of the mozambican 
government and not as a mediator 
he said chissano indicated that he might ask us to meet renamo 
some time if he does this we will consider it seriously 
renamo began its guerrilla war against the marxist government in 
1977 with rhodesian help and was then aided by south africa from 
198084 until south africa signed a nonagression pact with 
mozambique the mozambican government continued to accuse south 
africa of violating the agreement but relations have improved 
recently and the mozambican government now says support for the 
guerrillas still comes from south africa but it does not say who is 
behind it 
renamo which has been accused of mutilating peasants enslaving 
children burning villages and crops and attacking food relief 
convoys is not openly supported by any government but it maintains 
offices in the united states and portugal

six men accused of illegally aiding the contras have 
been cleared of neutrality act violations by a federal judge who 
said the us executive branch was conducting a secret war against 
nicaragua at the time 
defense attorneys on thursday hailed the dismissal as proof of 
their contention that the indicted men were only carrying out reagan 
administration policies 
the neutrality act allows prosecution of anyone making war from 
us soil against a nation with which the united states is at peace 
us district judge norman roettger of fort lauderdale agreed 
with the defense that the reagan administration waged war against 
the sandinistas in 198485 despite congressional votes to cut off 
funds for the ussupported nicaraguan rebels 
the facts show that the contras funded in part by the 
executive branch continued their attempt to overthrow the 
sandinista government roettger wrote the mere fact that 
congress refused to fund the contra cause for a brief period of time 
is not equivalent to saying that the united states was at peace 
with nicaragua 
he pointed to the conflicts in vietnam and korea as well as us 
raids on libya and the invasion of grenada under the reagan 
administration as evidence that war can be conducted without a 
formal declaration 
it appears that declarations of war between nations have become 
passe the judge said in his opinion released thursday 
during the hearings defense witnesses testified that lt col 
oliver north then a presidential aide was providing the contras 
with 32 million at the same time the defendants were training 
antisandinista mercenaries 
north was convicted may 4 of lying to congress altering and 
destroying classified national security council documents and 
accepting an illegal gratuity a security fence in the 
irancontra affair he was sentenced last week to two years 
probation and a 150000 fine 
the defendants in the neutrality act case also submitted volumes 
of the tower report on the irancontra affair detailing how profits 
from the sale of weapons to iran were diverted to the contras 
defense attorney john mattes who represents former mercenary 
jack terrell hailed roettgers decision as a vindication of his 
client 
this is the first time in the 10year history of the us war 
against nicaragua that a federal judge has had the courage to 
declare what we all knew mattes said thursday this has 
consequences far beyond a mere district court in south florida 
diane cossin spokeswoman for the us attorneys office said 
the prosecutors could not comment on a pending case 
the judges ruling completely cleared the four defendants accused 
of neutrality act violations mario calero brother of top contra 
leader adolfo calero thomas posey head of the private 
alabamabased mercenary group civilian materiel assistance former 
stock broker and conservative fundraiser alex martinez and wealthy 
texas businessman maco stewart 
terrell a former mercenary who soured on the war and provided 
much of the evidence used in the indictment is named in two minor 
weapons counts unaffected by the ruling 
mattes said terrells prosecution was vindictiveness by the

a judge has convicted a cocaineaddicted 
mother of delivering drugs to her two children through their 
umbilical cords at birth 
rejecting arguments that the law under which she was tried was 
meant only for criminals engaged in illegal drug deals circuit 
judge oh eaton jr said he viewed the two children born to 
jennifer clarise johnson as victims 
these children had no ability to control what was being 
introduced into their bodies eaton said in handing down the 
ruling thursday after a nonjury trial the defendant had that 
ability 
the unmarried 23yearold woman is believed to be the first 
mother in florida and one of only a few in the country convicted 
of pushing drugs to their children under a criminal drugdealing 
statute 
ms johnson faces a 30year sentence but prosecutor jeff deen 
said he would recommend that she complete a drug program she is 
undergoing and then serve a lengthy probation period 
in his ruling the judge made two key determinations 
that the illegal substance traveled from ms johnsons body 
into the babies at birth but before their umbilical cords were 
severed 
and that a child who is born but whose umbilical cord has not 
been severed is a person within the florida law under which she 
was tried 
the defense had argued that a newborn is not a person until the 
cord is severed and that ms johnson could not be tried under the 
law that makes it a felony for someone to deliver drugs to a 
minor 
i am convinced and find that the term delivery in the law 
includes the passage of cocaine or a derivative of it from the body 
of a mother into the body of her child through the umbilical cord 
after birth occurs the judge held 
ms johnson was acquitted of one count of child abuse other 
mothers giving birth to socalled cocaine babies have been 
successfully prosecuted under that law which carries a maximum of 
five years in prison 
the defendant who sat impassively during the trial refused 
comment her attorney jim sweeting said he would appeal 
sweeting representatives of the american civil liberties union 
and a doctor who testified on the defendants behalf had argued that 
a guilty verdict encourage pregnant addicts to avoid prenatal care 
and give birth to their babies outside hospitals because they would 
fear imprisonment 
i think what we found today is that having a baby is a crime 
for pregnant addicts sweeting said 
the judge said he believed the opposite to be true that 
pregnant addicts are now placed on notice that they have a 
responsibility to seek treatment 
the children a boy born in 1987 and a girl born in january are 
being cared for by ms johnsons mother and an aunt doctors said 
they appear to be healthy

a consumer group said today that it 
planned to test us cherries and other agricultural imports to 
determine if they contain unsafe levels of pesticides or carcinogens 
the citizens alliance for consumer protection of korea said the 
tests would be conducted in overseas laboratories if south korean 
labs either cannot or will not cooperate 
the first tests will be performed on imported us cherries to 
determine if they contain the chemical daminozide or alar a 
suspected cancercausing agent 
other imported us agricultural products also will be tested 
said song bokyung vice president of the alliance 
meanwhile the ministry of health and social affairs said today 
that recent concerns over food safety would result in more detailed 
testing of all imported food products 
the ministry said laboratory testing on us imported grapefruits 
and oranges showed they contained no alar but it said tests would 
be conducted on other agricultural products such as apple juice 
the alliance recently led a nationwide boycott of florida 
grapefruit after it said a government lab report indicated the 
presence of alar on some fruit although the lab later clarified the 
report to say that its test did not find the chemical consumers 
remained skeptical 
the government lab declined to retest the grapefruit and an 
independent lab said it did not have the equipment meanwhile 
koreas consumer movement against all chemicals in food production 
has grown 
on thursday the agriculture forestry and fisheries ministry 
announced a ban on the sale and use of alar on korean farm products 
last year an estimated 12540 pounds of alar was sold to south 
korean farmers the ministry said 
song said the concern is not restricted to alar which is used to 
enhance color and perserve storage life 
the other issue is residues of pesticides and chemicals on all 
imported food commodities from the united states the philippines 
or anywhere else she said this included beef products as well as 
fruits and vegetables 
song said that korean consumer groups depend heavily on consumer 
groups in the united states for research and information and the 
alliance coordinates with groups in other parts of the world 
we are concerned about the safety of foods the consumers eat 
she said we are not concerned for the businessmen or trade 
issues 
washington has pushed seoul to open its markets to us 
agricultural products to help correct south koreas trade imbalance 
which was 85 billion in 1988 south korean farmers have staged 
protests against us products claiming they undercut domestic 
prices 
the citizens alliance is one of the largest and most outspoken 
of 10 leading consumer associations that claim a combined nationwide 
membership of 2 million

david and james taggart saw their net worth 
increase tenfold in the four years they were associated with the ptl 
ministry a bank officer testified in their taxevasion trial 
from 1984 through 1987 the taggarts combined net worth climbed 
from 171000 to 17 million ncnb bank branch manager judy bailey 
said thursday citing personal financial statements she was provided 
by the taggarts for an unsecured line of credit at the bank 
the taggarts are charged with evading 487000 in federal income 
taxes from 1984 to 1987 prosecutors say they diverted 11 million 
in ministry funds to their own use by using ministry credit cards 
and then using blank ministry checks to pay off the cards 
on their 1983 statement the taggarts listed their net worth at 
171075 she testified by 1987 their net worth was listed at 
1695837 including 600000 in jewelry and more than 350000 in 
artwork 
james taggart 35 is an interior decorator in late 1984 he 
decorated the hotel suite for ptl president jim bakker his brother 
david 32 was bakkers deputy from 1980 until spring 1987 when 
bakker resigned in a sex and money scandal 
us district judge robert potter informed jurors that they would 
not have to return until monday morning potter also told the jury 
that the prosecution expected to rest its case monday morning and 
that the defense would begin 
justice department lawyer david brown said he expects to complete 
the governments case with two hours of testimony on monday 
defense attorney ben cotten said he expects his case to last one 
to two weeks 
testimony by bakker is a real possibility cotten said 
bakker faces trial next month on other charges growing from a 
16month federal investigation of the bankrupt ministry 
meanwhile on thursday a ptl accountant testified he had 
difficulty getting the taggarts to provide documentation for cash 
advances made to them by the ministry 
james guinn a certified public accountant hired by ptl at the 
time it was audited by the internal revenue service said he helped 
draft a letter recommending david taggart be fired if he did not 
hand over the documentation 
guinn testified that the action was necessary as the ministry 
prepared to appeal any sanctions by the irs including revocation of 
its taxexempt status 
they needed to show that as soon as they found the problem 
they took the appropriate steps guinn said 
guinn who specializes in taxexempt religious organizations 
said he was never able to convince david taggart to turn over any 
records 
if convicted on the tax evasion charges the taggarts each could 
be sentenced to 25 years in prison and face fines totaling about 1 
million

comparing the supreme court to the ku klux klan 
for recent decisions on civil rights and affirmative action naacp 
head benjamin l hooks called for a march on the nations capital 
next month to protest the rulings 
were not going to let four men and a woman in black robes turn 
us around any more than well let white robes turn us around 
hooks said thursday referring to the garb traditionally worn by 
klan members 
meanwhile the rev jesse jackson challenged president bush to 
offer blacks and other minorities more than kinder and gentler 
words 
former president reagan laid the tracks and built the engine 
to take the rights of workers and women and africanamericans and 
hispanics and the poor bush is putting grease on those tracks not 
brakes jackson told 3500 cheering people at the closing session 
of the groups 80th annual convention 
we all appreciate president bushs appeal a shift from 
hostility to be kinder and gentler we appreciate that he is 
prepared to meet and greet us and even sup with us and even shake 
our hands 
but after six months it is time to look beyond the smile and 
look at the substance because thousands of poor people working 
people women africanamericans and hispanics need more than 
kindness and gentleness said jackson who received the groups 
coveted spingarn medal for achievement by an american black 
the harsh criticism of the supreme court contrasted with the warm 
words hooks had for bush earlier in the week for his appointments 
and for inviting black leaders to the white house 
in the term just ended the high court struck down contract 
guarantees for minority firms made it tougher to prove bias in the 
workplace while making it easier for white males to contest 
affirmative action and allowed states to impose restrictions on 
abortions 
the rulings have impacted on the civil rights laws already on 
the books they have pinched them back so far that they have made 
them nearly null and void said hooks the groups executive 
director 
the nations oldest and largest civil rights organization 
addressed this week by vice president dan quayle and bush cabinet 
members jack kemp and louis sullivan decided to protest the 
administrations apparent inaction following the court rulings by 
calling for the aug 26 march hooks said 
the remarks by hooks and former democratic presidential candidate 
jackson continued the attacking tone set earlier in the day by 
democratic national chairman ronald brown 
we hear new words from the republican party said brown a 
former jackson campaigner and the first black to head the national 
party in politics as in poker theres a phrase for it 
i believe its time that we tell george bush dan quayle jack 
kemp national gop chairman lee atwater and the rest of those 
republicans its time to put up or shut up 
several other speakers also attacked the supreme court including 
former us equal employment opportunity commission chairwoman 
eleanor holmes norton 
the reagan administration is over at long last but through the 
court the music lingers on she said what we stand to lose is 
awesome 
norton said civil rights activists should turn to congress and 
the bush administration for redress now that conservative 
republicans she characterized as opposed to civil rights control the 
judiciary 
after his speech to the convention wednesday quayle told 
reporters the president did not feel the court decisions needed to 
be overturned to advance civil rights 
but jackson and others said legislation should be introduced in 
the wake of the court rulings which he said had shifted the 
burden of proof of discrimination onto the backs of the 
oppressed 
congress should introduce legislation clarifying the original 
intent and meaning of affirmative action he said and president 
bush should support it and agree not to veto it

police arrested a man for torching old glory but 
charged him with destroying property rather than desecrating the 
flag because of the recent us supreme court decision 
since we didnt know whether flag desecration was still 
punishable we didnt want to endanger the case by using that 
charge lt paul j gallagher of the police force in suburban 
north andover said thursday 
meanwhile the california senate on thursday approved a 
resolution urging congress to pass a constitutional amendment 
against flag burning a move already endorsed by president bush the 
state assembly passed a similar measure last month 
north carolinas senate passed by 470 a bill backed by gov jim 
martin that would revise the states flag desecration law making it 
a misdemeanor to destroy or mutilate an american or north carolina 
flag except for disposal purposes 
martin said the bill would not violate last months us supreme 
court ruling that flag burning is protected by the constitutions 
freedom of speech guarantee the bill was modeled after a measure 
proposed by new york gov mario cuomo and unlike the texas law 
struck down by the high court it does not refer to conduct that 
could seriously offend people 
in austin the texas house passed without objection an amendment 
to an antiflag desecration bill that would extend criminal 
penalties for desecration to flags of all us states and 
territories in addition to old glory and the texas flag 
in massachusetts police charged jack t fredyma of malicious 
destruction of property a felony punishable by up to 2 years in 
jail rather than desecration of a national symbol 
the key to the case is that fredyma allegedly burned someone 
elses flag not his own the supreme court ruling doesnt give 
you the right to take someone elses flag and burn it gallagher 
said 
fredyma allegedly took down a 5by8foot flag in front of 
american telephone amp telegraph cos plant in north andover 
wednesday night then set it on fire and ran it back up the flagpole 
the 27yearold man worked at the plant from january 1985 until 
last october and apparently was expressing anger at atampt gallagher 
said 
fredyma pleaded innocent wednesday in lawrence district court 
and the case was continued until oct 16 he declined to comment on 
the charge thursday but said he was fired by atampt after complaining 
about environmental hazards in the companys darkrooms a claim the 
company denies 
fredyma also faces federal charges of using the mail to make 
physical threats against his former supervisors 
according to an fbi affidavit filed in the case he sent a june 1 
letter to the boston office of the occupational safety and health 
administration in which he accused top atampt officials of being 
traitors against the us constitution and its people and 
threatened to use deadly force against these traitors 
walter murphy an atampt spokesman in new york said the company 
would not comment

two lawmakers said they will seek to outlaw 
dwarf tossing and dwarf bowling saying the barroom contests are 
demeaning and dangerous 
its just unbelievable that in this type of society were going 
to start throwing people around state sen nicholas spano said 
thursday 
there are enough prejudices out there against people who are 
different than others physically spano said we are going to 
play to those types of prejudices if we allow this to happen 
in grand rapids mich meanwhile a nightclub is facing state 
penalties for violating a restricted entertainment permit by holding 
a dwarf tossing contest in which patrons competed to see how far 
they could throw a person 
the state liquor control commission said thursday that it also 
cited the nightclub carnival for two unrelated liquor violations 
the bar could be fined up to 300 per violation and faces possible 
suspension or revocation of its liquor license although revocation 
is unlikely said ronalee polad a duty officer with the 
commissions enforcement division 
club manager scott vokoun who was aware that commission 
investigators were present that night said his attorney does not 
believe he violated his entertainment permit 
the contest drew more than 300 spectators as well as 50 
demonstrators many of them disabled who said the event was 
demeaning and cruel 
state rep richard bandstra has said he will introduce 
legislation later this year banning the event in michigan 
in new york spano and sen guy velella said they will introduce 
legislation banning the practices when the legislature returns to 
session in january a ban on dwarf contests was passed earlier this 
year in florida after dwarf tossing became popular near the 
university of florida 
dwarf bowlers compete by strapping a helmeted person to a 
skateboard and pushing him or her headfirst into bowling pins 
both contests originated in australia and have become fads at 
some parties and taverns across the country spano said contests 
have been held at bars on long island and in new york city 
a spokesman for decisions a nightclub in mineola said it had 
one dwarf bowling contest to promote a special australian night but 
wont do it again because of a bad reaction 
id like to try and get it stopped because its demeaning to a 
lot of little people said thomas acquafredda a yonkers member of 
the little people of america a national group representing dwarfs 
acquafredda approached spano seeking the ban 
acquafredda said bar owners take advantage of sick dwarfs who 
think they cant find other jobs theres no insurance to cover any 
injuries they might suffer he said 
the people in bars who are doing it i think are disturbed and 
jerks acquafredda said

bristolmyers co has announced it will make a 
new drug available to people with aids at no cost although safety 
testing on the drug is not complete 
ddi or dideoxyinosine appears to be effective but not dangerous 
like azt or azidothymidine the only drug now licensed to treat 
aids 
the new yorkbased companys decision thursday was hailed as a 
victory by advocates who have sought to give aids patients access to 
experimental drugs 
supporters of ddi in the united states and canada had asked that 
it be made available because about half of all acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome patients cannot take azt 
this is a historic development larry kramer a leading aids 
activist who founded the aids coalition to unleash power told the 
new york times we are grateful that pharmaceutical company has 
put compassion before greed 
the bristolmyers announcement took government officials by 
surprise officials of the us food and drug administration and the 
national institutes of health had discussed making the drug 
available but had not expected bristolmyers to act so quickly the 
times and the washington post reported in todays editions 
under regular practice a drugs safety is studied in phase i 
tests and its effectiveness is determined during a larger longer 
phase ii study ddi has only been through the phase i stage 
it is still up to the fda to decide if bristolmyers can legally 
distribute the drug to people who are not part of the phase ii 
testing the post said 
we want to do what we can to help said jerry parret a 
spokesman for bristolmyers any patient who does not meet the 
criteria for phase ii clinical trials but for whom ddi is critical 
would receive the drug 
the drug is expected to be distributed free of charge beginning 
in september when phase ii testing begins the newspapers said

majority to reappoint him 
the most aggressive deputies were unimpressed with kryuchkovs 
responses to queries on phone taps informers and dossiers but they 
relished the first opportunity in the nations history for a public 
grilling of the boss of the kgb which killed millions of soviet 
citizens during the reign of josef stalin and is still feared by 
many citizens 
only six members of the 542person supreme soviet voted against 
the 65yearold kryuchkov who has been kgb chairman since last year 
and was deputy chairman for 10 years before that 
kryuchkovs confirmation came despite derisive snorts of laughter 
from the hall when he claimed that the kgb does not tap soviet 
citizens phones and complaints from several deputies about the 
kgbs network of informers 
kryuchkov said the agency which performs both domestic and 
foreign security functions strictly follows soviet laws and has 
only a few helpers who inform on their neighbors and colleagues 
lawmaker boris yeltsin said kryuchkovs statements about 
informers were insincere and that in reality an army of many 
thousands constantly informs on what is happening in each work 
collective 
yeltsin said there were agents in every soviet institution yet 
during the 10 years he spent as communist party chief in the city of 
sverdlovsk they never caught a single spy 
marju lauristin a professor and peoples front leader from 
estonia also challenged kryuchkovs claims that the kgb employs few 
informants she said many of her students have told her they were 
offered money within the past year to inform on their fellow 
students and teachers 
its a fact she said 
kryuchkov refused to reveal the kgbs budget despite repeated 
inquiries but said it would be published soon and you will be 
surprised when you see it 
he also declined to reveal the number of kgb employees but did 
say the agencys border guard contingent alone numbers 200000 
kryuchkov also said the kgb does not maintain dossiers on any 
dissidents except those who present a real threat to the state

in a case that generated international 
protest and plea for clemency from the pope the state supreme court 
has set aside the death penalty for a teenage killer 
the court ruled 50 on thursday that paula cooper should serve a 
60year prison sentence for the stabbing death of an elderly bible 
teacher cooper committed the murder at age 15 
the court cited a 1988 us supreme court decision generally 
barring executions of killers who were under 16 at the time of the 
crime as well as a 1987 change in indiana law that sets an 
identical minimum age 
the indiana law was passed after coopers crime and was not 
retroactive but the indiana supreme court said it would be unfair 
not to apply it to her 
at the same time the justices said this is a difficult 
conclusion to reach because of the gruesome nature of coopers 
acts 
attorney general linley e pearson said the state had no grounds 
to appeal the ruling 
cooper now 19 pleaded guilty to the may 1985 slaying of ruth e 
pelke 78 of gary pelke was stabbed 33 times with a butcher knife 
after cooper and three friends went to her home on the pretext of 
taking bible lessons then stabbed and robbed the woman 
cooper an inmate at the indiana womens prison in indianapolis 
learned of the decision from prison superintendent clarence trigg 
it was a joyous occasion for her trigg said she jumped up 
and down 
cooper must serve half of her 60year term before she can apply 
for parole 
while pursuing her appeal cooper gained wide support in europe 
roman catholics and some european leftist groups adopted her as the 
symbol of their campaign against capital punishment amnesty 
international and the american civil liberties union also entered 
the case on coopers behalf 
in 1987 pope john paul ii wrote to thengov robert d orr to 
ask for clemency for cooper this march when the state court heard 
coopers appeal an italian group called non uccidere or thou shall 
not kill presented a clemency petition with 1 million signatures to 
the united nations 
michael sutherlin an indianapolis attorney who works for amnesty 
international said the cooper case really demonstrated how 
inappropriate the death penalty is as it is applied in this 
country 
in an unusual step the supreme court cited in footnotes to its 
opinion 11 news articles about the international protest and 
legislative maneuvering following coopers sentence 
while sparing cooper from the electric chair the supreme court 
said the circumstances surrounding her crime clearly support the 
next most severe penalty under the statute namely the maximum 
sentence of imprisonment

it is official policy in israel that the 
government and individual citizens have no dealings with the 
palestine liberation organization but the idea there is no contact 
is also one of israels most enduring myths 
israels government has worked out various deals with the plo 
over the years most notably prisoner exchanges and a nonaggression 
pact in lebanon in 1981 but even a hint in washington of possible 
israeliplo contacts raised a storm in jerusalem 
hardly had assistant secretary of state john h kelly raised the 
issue before a house subcommittee wednesday when denials were issued 
by spokesmen for prime minister yitzhak shamir and finance minister 
shimon peres head of the labor party 
its an absolute lie we are not speaking directly or 
indirectly with that group said shamirs spokesman yossi ahimeir 
kellys statement was the lead item on israel televisions 
evening news with all the official denials on staterun israel 
radio thursday there was an analysis of what kelly had and had not 
said it seemed more what he didnt say that raised the ruckus 
kelly said in answer to a question that it would be an 
exaggeration to say there were official contacts between the two 
sides but that there was classified reporting about contacts 
he added he could only discuss the issue further in a closed 
session suggesting there was secret evidence to support his claim 
amid the denials yossi beilin an outspoken deputy to peres 
admitted israel was having indirect contacts with the plo not only 
through the usplo dialogue in tunisia but through other foreign 
channels 
for 2 months clear official unequivocal negotiations have 
been under way between the israeli government headed by yitzhak 
shamir via the americans said beilin who is deputy finance 
minister 
whoever doesnt admit this whoever tries to ignore it is like 
a small boy who closes his eyes and thinks the world doesnt see 
him beilin said 
it should come as no surprise zeev schiff defense editor of the 
israeli daily haaretz wrote in april after shamir visited 
washington to unveil his peace initiative that the trip marked the 
start of indirect negotiations between israel and the plo 
mr shamir may insist that israel will never negotiate with the 
plo but he and his cabinet understand that from now on the 
americans will shuttle between them and the plo with proposals and 
counterproposals schiff said 
the united states began its dialogue with plo officials in tunis 
in january after plo chairman yasser arafat renounced terrorism and 
recognized israel a month earlier at a un meeting in geneva 
since then foreign ministry spokesman have repeatedly said that 
israel to ensure against even indirect contact with the plo has 
instructed its embassies abroad to neither request nor receive 
information about usplo meetings 
but they have hastened to add they would listen to the views of 
palestinians elicited by the americans without necessarily asking 
where they came from 
at the same time israeli officials have been meeting regularly 
with local palestinians who are known supporters of the plo such as 
faisal husseini to talk about shamirs plan for elections in the 
occupied territories 
over the years similar elaborate arrangements have been made to 
achieve contacts between israel and the plo 
in 1981 thenus special envoy philip habib and lt gen 
william callaghan commander of un interim force in lebanon 
shuttled between the two sides to work out a nonagression pact 
along the lebanon border 
it fell apart when israel invaded lebanon the next year blaming 
the plo for attacks on israeli diplomats in europe carried out by 
radical palestinian factions not linked to arafat 
prisoner exchanges were worked out between the two sides in 1982 
1983 and 1985 
one agreement allowed the evacuation of arafat and his guerrilla 
force from beirut in august 1982 according to israeli reports an 
israeli sniper had arafat in his scope at beiruts port but never 
pulled the trigger 
abie nathan the longtime israeli peace activist says he was 
given official permission by thendefense minister ariel sharon one 
of the most hardline opponents of the plo to see arafat in 1982 to 
try to free a captured israeli airman 
nathan said the family requested he go to beirut and sharon 
agreed he was unsuccessful he said because the government 
insisted on tough terms 
gen sharon told me to get him out without giving anything 
nathan said later he added the airman was freed in a prisoner 
exchange 
nathan who operates a pirate peace radio station offshore in the 
mediterranean says he has met arafat seven times the past 10 months 
in his quest for an end to the israeliarab conflict 
he is now facing charges of having contacts with a terrorist 
organization which the plo is under israeli law if convicted 
nathan can be sentenced to up to three years in jail

a state department of social services 
caseworker has been charged with failing to report a suspected case 
of sexual abuse after an 8yearold boy in a foster home died of 
aids 
the indictment issued thursday by a richland county grand jury 
charged frank edson with not investigating the case or notifying the 
proper law enforcement authorities as required by law 
the foster mother of brett hall of columbia told edson in 
october 1987 that the boy had been sexually abused but edson waited 
eight months before beginning his investigation according to the 
indictment by that time brett was dying of acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome a breakdown of the bodys immune system which 
leaves the victim fatally susceptible to viruses 
brett was 9 when he died in november 
edson was indicted on two counts of obstruction of justice and 
two counts of failure to report child abuse a 1977 state law 
requires child protection agencies to follow through on any 
suspected case of child abuse or neglect within 24 hours 
each count of obstruction of justice carries a maximum 10year 
prison term each count of failure to report child abuse carries a 
maximum 6month prison term and 500 fine 
social services spokeswoman norma g anderson who has worked at 
the agency since 1973 said it was the first time in her memory that 
an employee has been indicted on criminal charges for failing to 
follow through on a suspected child abuse case 
edson declined to comment on the indictment the state newspaper 
reported today calls by the associated press to his home this 
morning were not immediately returned 
state policy requires employees who have been indicted to be 
suspended or transferred to a less sensitive position until the 
criminal charges are resolved no action had been taken thursday on 
edson 
now that brett is dead there is no way to prosecute the person 
responsible so the investigation has turned toward the boys

the operating rate for us factories fell in 
june to 835 percent while industrial production dropped 02 
percent the government said today further easing concerns about 
inflation but providing more evidence of a slowing economy 
the federal reserve said the june operating rate declined 03 
percentage point from mays 838 percent and aprils 841 percent 
the rate hit a 10year high of 843 percent last december 
declines were widespread throughout the industrial sector with 
especially large drops for autos mining and utilities the 
central bank said 
economists had worried that the steady upward march of operating 
rates last year signaled increased inflationary pressures the 
closer us industry gets to full operating capacity the greater 
difficulty it has producing enough to meet demand leading to 
shortages and price increases 
analysts generally consider an operating rate of 85 percent or 
above as an indication of inflationary pressures 
until recently the central bank has been pushing up interest 
rates in an attempt to cool inflationary pressures without slowing 
growth so much that the economy slides into a recession 
in its other report today the federal reserve said its 
industrial production index stood at 1411 percent of its 1977 base 
34 percent higher than a year ago but down from mays 1414 
percent it was the first decline since it fell 02 percent in 
february which had been the first drop in a year 
the pace of industrial production had risen 06 percent in april 
last months factory operating rate of 835 percent was up from 
830 percent a year earlier 
the operating rate fell 03 percentage point to 838 percent at 
manufacturing plants down from mays 841 percent prior to april 
the rate had declined since it peaked at 847 percent in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods big ticket items 
expected to last more than three years fell 03 percentage point 
from 827 percent in may reflecting in large part a reduction in 
the production of autos 
the rate at factories producing nondurable goods dropped to 858 
percent comparied to mays 860 percent 
production meanwhile remained flat at manufacturing plants 
making both durable and nondurable goods 
output at mines and oil wells fell 11 percent following a 
revised 03 percent decline in may the june output was 17 percent 
lower than a year ago and analysts said in part reflected the 
effects of a monthold wildcat strike by more than 30000 coal 
miners in appalachia and the midwest 
production at utilities dropped 13 percent in june due in part 
to decreased use of air conditioning because of coolerthannormal 
weather utility production had dropped 02 percent in may

british prime minister margaret thatcher set off 
fireworks of her own at the celebrations marking the 200th 
anniversary of the french revolution saying the overthrow of the 
french monarchy was by no means the founding of the concept of human 
rights 
in an interview with the paris daily le monde just prior to the 
summit mrs thatcher said the concept of human rights was enshrined 
far earlier than the revolution in the british magna carta of 1215 
and in the american declaration of independence in 1776 
the prime minister also mentioned our glorious revolution in 
1688 when parliament imposed its will on the monarchy 
the response on both sides of the english channel has been loud 
and angry with boos for mrs thatcher as she arrived in paris 
criticism from french premier michel rocard and claims from one 
opposition british politician that shes gone mad 
in a chilly interview to be screened on british television later 
today frances socialist premier michel rocard reportedly attacks 
the british conservative party leader by referring to the current 
trend toward social cruelty in britain 
on thursday scattered booes mingled with applause greeted mrs 
thatcher when she arrived for the bicentennial celebrations 
sounds just like home quipped a senior thatcher aide who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
asked about the atmosphere between mrs thatcher and french 
president francois mitterrand during the festivities the spokesman 
said simply very good 
britains opposition socialist labor party which has a strong 
lead over mrs thatcher in domestic poll ratings today accused her 
of making an eccentric spectacle of herself with her 
offensive comments about the french revolution 
such conduct is of course extremely offensive to the french 
people who are taking part in an historic national celebration 
labors foriegn affairs spokesman gerald kaufman said in a statement 
issued in london 
it is even more worrying for the british people who are 
concerned for the serious problems this country faces after 10 years 
of thatcherism and who now watch with incredulity as the british 
prime minister makes an eccentric spectacle of herself in front of 
the world added kaufman 
i can only conclude that mrs tahtcher sees herself as a 20th 
century marie antoinette who faced with the justified complaint of 
the electorate she misrule airily replies let them eat pate 
kaufman said he wondered if mrs thatcher has gone mad her 
extraordinary behavior in paris indicates that she would do well to 
seek urgent psychiatric help 
headlines in the british press proclaimed booing greets 
thatcher in paris feud and the storming of maggie by angry 
french while the newspaper the express suggested that tempest has 
sent relations between britain and france plummeting to a new 
low 
mrs thatchers remarks underlined the long history of checkered 
relations between france and britain long time friends and rivals 
in fact the very conservative leader of britains conservative 
party was not alone in her assessment 
norman stone a professor of modern history at oxford university 
wrote in todays daily telegraph that mrs thatcher to her very 
great credit has taken a robust and british view of the french 
revolution telling le monde how much superior our own tradition is 
to all of the waffle sentimentality and mayhem that july 14 really 
symbolizes

brass bands marched down the champselysees today 
and scores of planes streaked across the sky leaving a trail of 
blue white and red smoke wafting over the heads of hundreds of 
thousands of bicentennial revelers 
celebrants danced and frolicked into the wee hours this morning 
at nearly a dozen places around paris to celebrate the july 14 
1789 storming of the bastille prison 
the thousands of revolutionaries who rushed the hated prison 
found only seven inmates to free locked up not for their politics 
but for fraud incest and lunacy but the action marked the 
beginning of the french revolution 
the traditional bastille day military parade in the morning 
followed allnight partying that briefly got out of hand resulting 
in a 5 am scuffle between a few stragglers that riot police tried 
to clear from the place de la bastille 
three of the batonwielding policemen were slightly injured as 
were an unknown number of others the french news agency agence 
francepresse reported about a dozen people were arrested

arc de triomphe to the place de la concorde where he took his place 
in the parade viewing stands behind bulletproof glass shielding 
more than 30 world leaders in paris

were president bush prime minister margaret thatcher of britain and 
president corazon aquino of the philippines

nine mirage 2000ns designed to carry nuclear warheads one 
squadron of aircraft trailed blue white and red smoke the french 
national colors

the prison stood before it was burned down during the french 
revolution 
the enormous circular place was jammed with people of all ages 
people perched on the base of the bastille monument and the 
staircase of the new glassandsteel opera bastille 
directly across a huge white tent sheltered a stage where jazz 
musicians african bands and accordion virtuosos played waltzes 
marches and other music to the staccato accompaniment of fireworks

this beats any party back home said robert mckean of 
alameda calif who took a break from studying french in summer 
school to meet his friends at the bastille

jailed nationalist leader 
nelson mandela wants permission to meet a wide range of 
antiapartheid activists to coordinate strategies a newspaper 
reported today 
the antiapartheid weekly mail said mandela hopes to see several 
black trade union leaders when he meets with his family on tuesday 
his 71st birthday 
without citing sources the weekly mail said mandela has composed 
a list of up to 150 people he would like to see at victor verster 
prison outside cape town where he lives alone in a suburbanstyle 
house 
mandela met july 5 with president pw botha fueling speculation 
that the black leader soon may be freed and that the government is 
seeking new means to break the countrys political stalemate 
the need to meet with opposition leaders has become 
pressing the weekly mail said adding that some antiapartheid 
groups fear mandelas isolation makes unified political action 
difficult 
the newspaper said mandela wanted to see jay naidoo elijah 
barayi and cyril ramaphosa of the congress of south african trade 
unions the countrys largest labor federation 
the prisons service declined to comment when asked if mandela had 
made such a request or if he would be receiving visitors in the near 
future 
mandela the countrys best known black leader and head of the 
african national congress guerrilla movement receives regular 
visits from his family and attorney but talks with antiapartheid 
leaders have been rare 
he was imprisoned in 1962 under a life sentence for sabotage and 
plotting to overthrow the white government 
the antiapartheid movement which has many factions and numerous 
disagreements has reacted to the bothamandela meeting with 
conflicting statements 
mandelas wife winnie initially dismissed the talks at the 
presidents official cape town residence as government propaganda 
involving no shift in policy but the tone changed when mandela 
released a statement wednesday indicating he welcomed his chance to 
talk with botha 
we do not condemn the meeting at all mrs mandela was quoted 
as saying by the independent south african press association for 
us to get to the negotiation table we have to start somewhere 
the african national congress dismissed the meeting as a public 
relations exercise it has not commented publicly on mandelas 
statement 
among issues that divide the groups is whether or not they should 
use violence to force change in south africa 
in another development the new nation newspaper said police 
raided mrs mandelas home on the day her husband visited botha 
the newspaper said it did not know the reason for the raid on the 
house in soweto the huge township outside johannesburg 
mrs mandela has mentioned no such incident and could not be 
reached for comment police said they had no immediate comment but 
would respond later

the prominence given to the environment at the 
paris economic summit reflects a growing view among world leaders 
that the battle against pollution is too immense and complicated for 
a single nation to tackle 
president bush and his advisers are expected to argue forcefully 
that unless a resounding effort is made to enlist all countries the 
moves to cut pollution by a few nations could be wiped out by 
actions taken or not taken elsewhere in the world 
so leaders of the seven largest industrial nations the united 
states britain france west germany japan italy and canada 
want to conclude their meeting sunday with a unified voice that will 
carry weight among leaders not present 
the summit participants are aware that the environment has become 
a hot political issue repeated polls indicate that people want 
their leaders to tackle the worlds pollution problems 
at the same time the bush administration sees the environment as 
a way for the united states to extend a new form of leadership in 
the sometimes troubled western alliance as well as becoming the 
conduit toward closer eastwest ties in the coming years 
our shared heritage is the earth president bush said during 
his stay in hungary and the fate of the earth transcends borders 
it is not just an eastwest issue 
dozens of international conferences have been held or are 
scheduled for the next few years to deal with global warming the 
decay of the protective stratospheric ozone layer dirty urban air 
and oceans contaminated with everything from medical wastes to 
sprawling oil spills 
all of these topics will be the focus of debate at the economic 
summit today through sunday in paris the environment is coming on 
like a freight train as an international issue bush has said 
his chief environmental spokesman william reilly head of the 
environmental protection agency complained recently that some of 
the conference participants may be trying to move too quickly 
there is something of a race on by some of the economic summit 
participants to be the greenest of all on this issue said 
reilly the first epa administrator ever to attend an economic 
summit restoring the environment is not a sprinters game its 
going to require steady longterm commitments 
the bush administration however has been criticized by some 
environmentalists for being too slow in asserting us leadership on 
dealing with the growing global environmental mess 
earlier this year the united states dragged behind in calling for 
a ban on the production of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs which are 
blamed for depleting the ozone layer the united states announced 
support for a ban only after european nations did 
the administration also waited until the last minute before 
calling for an international workshop on global warming and then did 
so after critics charged the president was backing away from a 
campaign pledge to host such a conference the workshop was to be 
held in washington but now is planned for geneva in october 
although reilly insists the united states will remain its host 
the seven nations at the summit use about 60 percent of the 
worlds ozonedepleting cfcs and account for about 40 percent of the 
worlds carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels 
the principal culprit in global warming 
you wouldnt launch a marshall plan at an economic summit 
reilly quipped to reporters recently while reviewing his 
expectations of the paris meeting the 15th such summit and the 
first in which the environment has held this much attention

the four members of a special us air force reserve 
unit who parachuted over the sinking wreckage of a singleengine 
plane routinely practice the sea rescue maneuver theyve never 
rehearsed a miracle however 
the team watched the powerless cessna 210 spiral into the sea off 
the bahamian island of eleuthera with thomas root slumped 
unconscious in the pilots seat when they leaped from the hc130 
hercules plane 3000 feet above the crash site they assumed they 
would recover a body 
then we saw there was a survivor said tech sgt dave dahl 
it was very special on the verge of being a miracle in fact it 
was right at miracle 
root who passed out after taking off from washington national 
airport about 630 am thursday and flew for nearly four hours on 
autopilot was awakened by the impact and managed to hang onto a 
raft dropped from the hc130 authorities said today that he had 
been shot in the abdomen at some point during the flight and he was 
bleeding from the abdomen when rescued he was listed in stable 
condition at memorial hospital in hollywood north of miami it was 
not immediately clear how the shooting occurred 
i was slowly parachuting down then i heard from the plane that 
he was alive my first reaction was that they either saw a body 
floating or they were mistaken said staff sgt scott tracy 
its almost unreal 
around the country nearly 82000 air force reserve personnel 
augment the air force in crises and in peacetime 
the unit from the 301st aerospace rescue and recovery squadron in 
homestead is one of three such teams trained to bring em back 
alive said air force lt col robert dubiel in robins ga the 
others are based near detroit and near portland ore he said 
they have to know how to pull them from the water pluck them 
off a mountain if they have to dubiel said they have to be in 
super condition 
the three squads had more than 400 military and civilian rescues 
during the past 10 years dubiel said the unit based in homestead 
about 20 miles south of miami is credited with 142 rescues in the 
atlantic and the caribbean 
dahl said there are fewer than 10 seaparachute rescue missions 
in any year around the world 
we wait for years for one of these missions said dahl for 
everything to go perfectly like this is just a great feeling 
after root was given first aid and oxygen aboard the raft he was 
airlifted aboard a coast guard hh3 helicopter to nassau bahamas 
for initial treatment the 36yearold lawyer from alexandria va 
was then taken to opalocka airport north of miami on a coast guard 
jet 
looking back now the whole scene was incredible said sgt 
paul hayden its like a onceinalifetime thing

fierce rocket and artillery duels occurred 
in beirut today after an oil tanker broke through a syrian blockade 
and began unloading badly needed gasoline for the besieged 
christians 
police said the barrage killed one person and and wounded seven 
that raised the toll to 410 killed and 1622 wounded since march 
8 when the confrontation began between the 20000 troops of the 
christian army commander gen michel aoun and syrias 
40000strong force in lebanon 
syrians opened up with 130mm howitzers and bm21 rocket 
launchers hitting east beiruts residential districts and a 28mile 
coastal stretch to the north dotted with three major ports and small 
harbors 
the sovietdesigned launchers fire 40 122mm rockets a minute 
aouns gunners fired back with 155mm howitzers targeting syrian 
batteries along west beiruts main boulevard but several shells 
also crashed in residential districts causing considerable damage 
radio stations interrupted programs to advise residents to stay 
in basements and underground shelters 
news reporter bahjat jaber said that from his house he watched 
scores of rockets and shells fall along the beach at the 
christian port of jounieh 12 miles north of beirut 
the whole area is shaking jaber said by telephone they 
are shelling every docking facility even fishermens ports 
a spokesman for aoun said the syrian target was a tanker carrying 
gasoline for 1 million christians besieged in a 310squaremile 
enclave 
the spokesman who requested anonymity said lebanese gunners 
provided cover for the vessel to sail into port 
the tanker has already dropped anchor he said refusing to 
say at which harbor for security reasons he also would not give the 
tankers name the amount of gasoline it was carrying or its 
nationality 
he said a syrian gunboat intercepted the ship earlier today in 
lebanese territorial waters searched it for arms and allowed it to 
sail on but soon after syrian gunners opened up 
syrian shells have struck at least six ships since the blockade 
was imposed march 12 the last victim was the malteseregistered 
tanker aloil which sank off the enclave sunday after unloading 880 
tons of gasoline 
the aloil also had been searched by syrian gunboats and allowed 
to sail on before it was shelled 
syria began the siege in retaliation for a blockade aoun imposed 
on illegal ports run by syrianbacked militias south of beirut 
syrian gunboats intervened to tighten the siege two weeks ago 
after reports that aoun obtained sovietdesigned frog7 missiles 
from iraq syrias main arab rival 
syria demanded the mediumrange missiles capable of hitting 
damascus be removed from the enclave 
aoun and his aides have refused to confirm or deny acquisition of 
the missiles which have a range of 45 miles 
syria and iraq are longtime rivals and iraq has declared support 
for aouns war of liberation against syrian troops deployed in 
lebanon under a 1976 arab league peacekeeping mandate 
aoun says the syrians lost their credibility after siding with 
the moslems in the strife that has so far killed more than 150000 
people

a mildly retarded killer died in alabamas 
electric chair early today in the second execution attempt after the 
first try failed because of a misconnected cable 
horace franklin dunkins jr 28 was declared dead at 1227 am 
19 minutes after the executioner first flipped the voltage switch 
the us supreme court turned down two lastminute appeals to stop 
the execution 
state prison commissioner morris thigpen and prison warden 
charles jones said the jacks connecting electricity to the chair 
were reversed and so did not deliver enough voltage to kill dunkins 
on the first try 
through our procedures of checking the equipment each day 
somehow someway it got reversed and we are right now correcting 
the problem jones said 
i regret very very much what happened thigpen said it 
was human error i just hope he was not conscious and did not 
suffer 
dunkins attorney steve ellis described dunkins death as a 
grisly scene 
when the guard raised the two vinyl shades covering the window in 
the witness room dunkins was already strapped in the electric 
chair his face covered by a black veil attached to the hood of the 
electrodes on his head 
thigpen said the first throw of the switch at 1208 am brought 
no visible response from the condemned man 
a guard in the witness room opened the door to the death chamber 
and told another guard directing the execution i believe youve 
got the jacks on wrong neither guard was identified 
two doctors who examined dunkins determined he was unconscious 
but had a strong heartbeat thigpen told a news conference later 
theyre torturing him ellis said softly to a fellow witness 
during the medical exam 
at 1217 am the switch was thrown a second time ten minutes 
later dunkins was pronounced dead 
alabama law allows application of electricity to the condemned 
until the prisoner is dead 
dunkins execution marked the second time in six years that 
alabama prison officials were forced to use more than one surge of 
electricity to carry out a death sentence in 1983 it took three 
jolts to execute john louis evans iii a drifter who was put to 
death for killing a mobile pawnbroker 
dunkins who according to court documents has an iq of 69 was 
convicted in 1981 of murdering lynn mccurry a 26yearold mother of 
four who was found stabbed 66 times and bound to a tree behind her 
home a second defendant frank m harris pleaded guilty and is 
serving a life sentence 
dunkins became the 115th person executed in the united states and 
the fifth in alabama since the us supreme court allowed states to 
reinstate capital punishment in 1976 
the nations high court ruled two weeks ago that the death 
penalty is not unconstitutional when applied to the mentally 
retarded as long as the sentencing judge and jury consider the 
condition as a mitigating factor dunkins was described as mildly 
retarded 
as his last request dunkins asked to talk to gov guy hunt by 
telephone but thigpen said the governor did not wish to speak to 
him 
hunt had denied clemency earlier thursday saying that he had 
reviewed dunkins case but would not alter the decision by the 
courts the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta also 
refused to halt dunkins execution 
the condemned inmate had met with ministers on the eve of his 
execution he also visited with his father horace franklin dunkins 
sr who later was among 13 who witnessed the execution 
the us supreme court voting 72 each time twice refused 
thursday to block dunkins execution an initial request for a stay 
of execution had been sent to the high court raising legal 
questions about executing an inmate of limited mental ability 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall voted to spare 
dunkins 
the victims husband allen mccurry had said that dunkins 
deserved execution its taken so long he said it ought to 
be over

a federal judge today upheld the constitutionality 
of a dade county pit bull ordinance that imposes severe restrictions 
on the dogs but delayed enforcement for 30 days 
us district judge william m hoeveler ordered the grace period 
to give the dog owners who have not complied with the ordinance 
requiring registration pending my verdict an opportunity to comply 
with the ordinance 
in three days of hearings this week witnesses testified that 
only seven owners of pit bulls had registered a total of eight 
animals even though thousands are believed to be in the county 
the legislation came under fire in a lawsuit brought by the 
michiganbased american dog owners association nova university law 
professor steve wisotsky representing dog owners said the 
measures description of pit bulls was too vague 
the ordinance was adopted in april following the mauling of a 
young girl and her mother 
owners are required to register their dogs with dade county 
animal services in a 90day period that ended today 
owners must confine or muzzle their dogs except at dog shows 
they may not be walked within 50 feet of any public school and

a federal judge today struck down a rhode 
island law that keeps ethics complaints against public officials 
confidential saying it violates the first amendment rights of the 
person filing a complaint 
us district judge raymond j pettine issued a permanent 
injunction forbidding the state to enforce the rule against alfred 
gemma who filed a complaint against warwick mayor francis x 
flaherty and then discussed it with reporters 
state law and ethics commission rules forbid the person filing a 
complaint and the target of that complaint from discussing it in 
public until the commission reaches a decision on its merits 
the commission argued the rule is needed to keep innocent public 
officials from being unfairly tarred by frivolous complaints but 
pettine ruled that interest while legitimate was outweighed by the 
first amendments protection of freespeech rights 
the question is not whether the states concerns are 
legitimate but whether they are compelling enough to silence a 
citizencritic of official conduct through the imposition of civil 
and criminal sanctions pettine wrote supreme court precedent 
makes it very clear that the answer to this question must be a 
resounding no 
he added that it is a fundamental assumption of our system of 
governmful beams of atomic particles across space 
a spokesman for the strategic defense initiative organization 
army maj william oconnell said the experiment was conducted early 
thursday morning at the white sands missile range in new mexico 
its the first time a neutral particle beam was fired or 
operated in space oconnell said basically its to see 
whether a neutral particle beam would behave in space as we had 
theorized 
the spokesman said it was presumptive to announce whether the 
test had been a success since sdi officials and scientists needed 
to study the results of the experiment 
oconnell said sdi officials planned to release more information 
about the experiment on monday 
the test involved technology that will be used by the sdi program 
in its later phases 
the experiment involved the lifting into space just for a few 
minutes of a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small aires 
rocket before the rocket returned to earth the accelerator was to 
be turned on and scientists would collect data on how it worked and 
how the particle beams moved 
the total flight was to last only about 15 minutes 
in june a similar test was aborted when the rocket failed to 
ignite on command 
the star wars program is a research effort aimed at developing 
lasers beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be 
used to automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the 
united states or its allies 
the defense and energy departments are spending 4 billion on 
such research this year

turner who put his outspoken manner on the back burner the past 
few years as his business dealings became more time consuming 
showed he hasnt lost his flair for controversy when he made the 
remarks about abortion foes in los angeles wednesday 
in a speech turner said tbs would present abortion for 
survival a program that takes a prochoice slant in line with his 
own views

follow the program

hajek who served during the prague spring reforms was detained for 
five hours today while on his way to give a lecture on the 1968 
reform movement sources said 
sources in vienna and prague who requested anonymity said 
police in prague detained hajek at the hotel olympic the sources 
said a west german group was holding a seminar on czechoslovak 
history at the hotel 
an emigre source in vienna said earlier today that hajek was 
picked up with a west german citizen but the sources in prague and 
a west german who witnessed the detention said hajek was alone 
the sources said the seminar where hajek was to speak about the 
shortlived prague spring liberalization period was banned by 
authorities but that no one else was detained 
the west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher visited 
czechoslovakia this week and met thursday with hajek in talks with 
top czechoslovak officials genscher reportedly stressed the 
special importance of human rights in boosting eastwest 
relations 
the sources said the detention prevented hajek from attending a 
reception at the french embassy marking the bicentennial of the 
french revolution 
hajek was released at 215 pm and taken home in a police car 
but by then it was too late for the reception 
hajek 76 who served as foreign minister during the 1968 prague 
spring reform period that was crushed by soviet troops had his 
passport confiscated july 4 after he returned from a scandinavian 
trip 
sources in vienna said he was told the measure was taken because 
of interviews he gave western media while he was abroad and because 
he attended a meeting of the socialist international in stockholm 
june 2022 
during the interviews hajek accused the czechoslovak regime of 
being slow to implement reforms 
hajek is a member of charter 77 the soviet blocs oldest

and named for the document issued by founding members calling on

mayor marion barry jr whose administration 
has been dogged by scandal will run for a fourth term and does not 
expect jesse jackson to oppose him a spokesman said today 
the mayor definitely intends to seek reelection barrys 
press secretary john white said i think he generally feels that 
he would like to run one more term to complete some of the projects 
that he started 
jackson who had said through aides he would consider running for 
mayor only if barry stepped down said in a newspaper interview he 
has no plans to seek the post 
ill be doing more and more work out of washington for the 
cause of the rainbow coalition he told the detroit free press on 
thursday jackson who has plans to move to the nations capital by 
the end of the summer said it makes more sense to have a house than 
to stay in hotels 
barrys decision to seek a new term comes after months of 
speculation about his plans particularly in view of a string of 
highlevel resignations the conviction of several former aides on 
criminal charges and the mayors friendship with a man convicted on 
drug charges in the virgin islands who is awaiting trial on 
additional charges in washington 
the washington post today quoted barry aides it did not identify 
as saying that letting word out that the mayor would run was an 
attempt to force jackson out of contention 
barry has indicated previously he would announce his candidacy 
officially in the fall 
jackson in detroit for a speech to the national association for 
the advancement of colored people on thursday night told the post 
i have no comment i dont know the context in which the barry 
statement was made 
but white said barry feels jackson will keep his word which 
was that he would never run against the mayor 
we expect jesse jackson to actively campaign for the mayors 
reelection another barry aide anita bonds told the post 
pointing to barrys early support for both of jacksons presidential 
campaigns 
white said he did not know whether jackson and barry have 
discussed the mayors candidacy 
barrys recent problems have prompted some business and community 
leaders to urge him to step aside after three terms 
barry has weathered a series of personal and political crises 
since becoming mayor in 1979 several of his top aides including 
two former deputy mayors have been convicted of crimes they 
committed while in office 
most recently barry was reported to have visited a man charles 
lewis at a washington ramada inn last year while lewis was 
suspected of trafficking in drugs lewis has since been convicted in 
the virgin islands of dealing cocaine and has been indicted in 
washington on charges that he sold cocaine while he stayed at the 
washington hotel last december 
white said barry has put the lewis situation behind him he 
feels he has explained his relationship with lewis and that no 
matter what he says not everyone will believe him 
several top aides including police chief maurice turner also 
have resigned 
at the same time the citys homicide rate has soared 
police say the 372 killings in 1988 were a record and that the 
229 slayings committed through thursday this year put the city on 
pace to far outstrip last yeas total authorities estimate at least 
60 percent of the homicides have been drugrelated 
announced candidates for mayor include council chairman david 
clarke and former utility executive sharon pratt dixon both 
democrats they would face barry in the democratic primary success 
in the primary is tantamount to a general election victory in this 
heavily democratic city

national security adviser brent scowcroft said today 
the bush administration will take a close look at soviet claims that 
it would give up sealaunched nuclear cruise missiles if the united 
states did the same 
thats one of the open areas in start scowcroft said in 
reference to the ussoviet negotiations to limit strategic arms 
weve had a number of proposals back and forth well have to look 
at this one carefully and see what it means 
however scowcroft said verification remains a serious problem to 
overcome scowcroft who is in paris with president bush for the 
economic summit was interviewed on cbstvs this morning 
program 
in moscow col gen nikolai chervov said the kremlin would be 
willing to give up the sealaunched cruise missiles depending on 
us actions 
chervov chief of the arms control section of the soviet general 
staff said if i were determining policy then id accept it 
the washington post reported in todays editions 
the general said it was a progressive suggestion to eliminate 
nuclear cruise missiles 
the comments marked a departure from the soviet stance on the 
issue at the ussoviet arms negotiations taking place in geneva 
the soviets said chervov would prefer to give up all cruise 
missiles at sea but faced with the us navys strong desire to 
keep conventionally armed missiles we are coming to this 
how the soviet union decides well see chervov said 
chervov said the soviet military budget would decline about 25 
percent by 1995 he said defense spending already had been reduced 
10 billion rubles the equivalent of 16 billion at official 
exchange rates below the governments orginial plan for 1987 and 
1988 
he said military spending would drop another 10 billion rubles by 
1992 and if circumstances allow by 10 billion rubles more in the 
following three years 
in may soviet president mikhail s gorbachev said the soviet 
military budget for 1989 was 773 billion rubles the equivalent of 
118 billion and the total would be cut by 10 billion rubles by the 
end of 1991

an elementary school principal who urged 
the school board to fire him rather than cut any of the teachers in 
this financially pressed school district was out of a job today 
some of the board members had tears in their eyes as they voted 
unanimously thursday night to lay off norman najimy 
this was the shortest and saddest meeting in our history 
board member donna slowick said after the 20minute session 
immediately afterward najimy a teacher for 37 years turned in 
his keys to superintendent george st pierre 
maintaining it could balance the books with the least impact on 
the children najimy suggested that the berkshire hills community 
could save about 40000 by firing him and paying a teacher an extra 
3000 to run its 200pupil elementary school 
building faculty is the hardest thing to do najimy said 
if we lose our teachers we will never get them back 
even though voters in the little town of 1600 people approved 
overrides of property tax limits totaling 75000 it was not enough 
to cover boosts in health insurance the breakdown of its heating 
plant and rising tuition costs for its high school students najimy 
said

leaders of the worlds seven richest nations 
turning from partying to politics opened their annual summit today 
with talks focusing on the economic struggles in eastern europe and 
the harsh repression of human rights in china 
the initial session of the 15th world economic summit began at 
the new glass louvre pyramid now the main entrance and 
architecturally controversial structure in front of the famed museum 
the first order of business was a picturetaking session for the 
class photo of president bush and the leaders of britain 
france west germany japan italy and canada 
even before the summit began bush won a victory on a contentious 
trade issue with japan reversing course japan agreed to hold talks 
with the united states on a broad range of trade barriers which the 
administration contends are a major cause of the 52 billion us 
trade deficit with the asian nation 
on the other hand bush maneuvered unsuccessfully to obtain a 
final agreement between mexico and its commercial bank lenders on 
restructuring mexicos foreign debt of more than 100 billion 
mexican president carlos salinas de gortari told bush that no 
deal is in sight despite french president francois mitterrands 
warning that mexico is on the edge of an explosion because of the 
weight of its debt 
todays first session of the big seven industrial democracies 
coincides with the climax of three days of festivities marking the 
200th birthday of the french revolution 
the salute to the july 14 1789 storming of the bastille which 
marked the beginning of the revolution began with a military parade 
down the champs elysees the most famous thoroughfare in paris 
heavy tanks rumbled past the vip viewing stand as mirage jet 
fighters screamed overhead trailing streams of red white and blue 
smoke the colors of the french flag 
with more than two dozen heads of state and government invited to 
the festivities there was an extraordinary gathering of world 
leaders from nations rich and poor 
bush leader of the worlds wealthiest nation got a front row 
parade seat next to president hossain mohammed ershad of bangladesh 
representing one of the worlds poorest 
bush began the day with a hurriedly arranged meeting with salinas 
on his countrys commercial lenders afterward white house chief of 
staff john sununu reported there was no early prospect for a final 
agreement 
sununu said mexican officials want to get it done correctly 
rather than trying to rush it and the white house believes 
there is no requirement to leave the summit with an 
agreement 
the united states offered a loan of 1 billion to 2 billion to 
help mexico seal an agreement preferably before the economic summit 
ends on sunday but sununu said the negotiations remained snagged 
over details 
mitterrand who is pushing a rival plan for solving the third 
world debt problem said in a french tv interview that mexicos 
foreign debt has carried that country to the brink of an explosion 
no one has an interest in this explosion taking place which 
would mean more misery for a suffering people he said we are 
contributing i am contributing as far as possible so that a 
positive answer could be given in the coming days 
the 15th economic summit marks bushs debut at the annual 
gathering of the leaders of the united states japan britain 
france west germany canada and italy leaders of some of the third 
world countries attending the bastille celebration urged the 
prosperous nations to hold a summit between rich and poor nations 
mitterrand has been harshly criticized in the press here for the 
extravagence of the bicentennial celebration as well as for holding 
two separate dinners tonight for have and havenot nations 
bush through a spokesman rallied to mitterrands side 
i dont think the president sees any difficulty at all in the 
way the french have laid out their plans their celebrations or 
their hosting of the summit meeting said sununu 
bush hoped the summit would let him assume the mantle of 
leadership on economic and environmental issues much as he did on 
military matters in may with a troop reduction proposal at the nato 
summit in brussels 
following his stops this week in poland and hungary bush planned 
to press for a coordinated economic aid program to reward the two 
east bloc nations for democratic reforms among other steps bush 
was expected to express support for new loans and debt rescheduling 
to ease their financial woes 
chinas bloody crackdown on prodemocracy students in tiananmen 
square and subsequent repressions also were on the agenda it 
appeared likely the leaders would approve a statement of concern 
about events in china rather than endorse any collective sanctions 
sununu said bush would welcome a summit statement reiterating 
previously expressed condemnations and concerns about human rights 
violations in china 
we know of no specific proposals that go that even brings all 
of the countries up to the levels that the president has gone much 
less going further sununu said 
the united states has cut off military sales and technology 
transfers to china urged a freeze on international loans for 
beijing and restricted us diplomatic contacts 
the summit will turn to economics and other subjects on saturday 
and sunday bush is seeking an international agreement on tackling 
problems of global pollution 
other leaders had their own agendas 
attempting to overcome a sex scandal which has shaken his 
government japanese prime minister sosouke uno came armed with 
nearly 40 billion in aid to improve the global environment and 
provide financial support to lessen the staggering 12 trillion 
debt burden carried by developing countries 
mitterrand has his own rival plan for third world debt so does 
bush 
nicholas brady bushs treasury secretary unveiled a strategy 
march 10 to encourage commercial banks to voluntarily forgive a 
portion of developing nations bad debt 
security problems of protecting the big seven summit leaders 
were compounded by the presence of more than 30 presidents and prime 
ministers who are mitterrands guests for the bicentennial 
festivities 
fanning out over an 80mile circle around paris 30000 security 
forces erected a protective cocoon around the leaders while an 
observation blimp hovered over the crowds sharpshooters kept watch 
from rooftops and troops armed with groundtoair missiles kept an 
eye on the skies

the kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in turkey 
iran and iraq and small enclaves of 500000 each in syria and the 
soviet union 
liebhart said the other two killed were abdullah ghaderiazar

france and iraqborn fadel mala mahmoud rasoul 38 who has held 
austrian citizenship since 1985

discussion 
two or three men stormed into the apartment and opened fire 
liebhart said the three fatalities were shot in the head

despite the ceasefire between the two countries since august 1988

mourners streamed into churchyards in 
several villages today for the funerals of 14 people killed when a 
farmer ran amok with a doublebarreled shotgun bastille day 
celebrations were canceled and decorative flags and bunting removed 
from streets and buildings 
the gunman who was seriously wounded in a shootout with police 
was moved today from a hospital in besancon to the fresne prison 
hospital near paris he was charged with murder and attempted 
murder police said 
investigators and witnesses described how christian dornier 31 
shot his mother and sister to death wounded his father then got in 
his car and drove around this village of 128 people and neighboring 
communities for about two hours firing at anyone he saw 
the spree came to an end in verne where officers returned fire 
and hit him in the abdomen said a spokesman for the besancon 
headquarters of the gendarmerie the military police responsible for 
public order in rural france 
verne with the only functioning church in the area was the site 
of the largest funeral service 
eight people including two children were buried in a ceremony 
there attended by relatives friends and more than 1000 
sympathizers 
separate funerals were held in other villages for the six other 
victims 
seven of the dead were from luxiol the others came from the 
nearby communities of anteuil autechaux sechin fourbanne 
baumelesdames and voillans 
neighbors said dornier had frightened them long before the 
dramatic events of wednesday afternoon 
dornier was under heavy police guard partly for his own 
protection from the irate citizens the genedarmerie spokesman 
said speaking on condition of anonymity 
the spokesman said investigators were taking seriously reports 
that local people had privately threatened dornier 
the investigating magistrate in charge of the case is expected to 
decide next week whether dornier must stand trial or be considered 
legally insane 
the maximum penalty for murder in france is life in prison if 
someone is ruled insane he can be interned in a psychiatric 
institution as long as necessary 
we knew he would create havoc one day and the police should 
have dealt with him months ago unfortunately our laws dont allow 
such preventive action said dominque cuenot a member of the 
village council 
everyone here was afraid of christian dornier said joel 
clausse whose father is mayor his behavior was strange no one 
ever complained to the police about him but we all knew 
christian was a taciturn depressed fellow serge dornier 
said of his brother he had no friends hardly ever talked to 
anyone a few weeks ago he suddenly got a punk haircut he did 
strange things like that and we did not pay much attention 
the village council had decided no action was called for because 
christian dornier had never been in trouble with the law 
we advised the family to get him psychiatric treatment and 
they did said jacques fleury a council member 
a psychiatrist came regularly from nearby baumelesdames and 
prescribed tranquilizers but serge said his brother did not take 
them

from chinas early revolutionary years and the 196676 leftist 
cultural revolution among the popular songs are socialism is 
good without the communist party there would be no new china 
i am a soldier and party beloved mother 
the tape began appearing in stores this week and sales figures 
were not available the lyrics carry the same message party leaders 
have been preaching since the army put down studentled 
prodemocracy protests june 34 
unity is strength this strength is iron this strength is 
steel 
i am a soldier i come from the ordinary people i love the 
country and love the people 
in socialism is good the peoples liberation army song and 
dance troupe sings the reactionaries have been overthrown the 
imperialists have run away with their tails between their legs 
the collection stays away from cultural revolution songs that 
idolized mao tsetung and only one song refers to mao as our 
leader 
the message of the videotape is less subtle charred corpses of 
soldiers killed by angry beijing residents and footage of crowds 
stoning soldiers during the weekend attack are accompanied by a 
narrative that condemns handfuls of thugs said to be responsible 
the nearly hourlong video titled the true story of the 
turmoil went on sale to foreigners thursday for the first time at 
a seminar for foreign travel agents 
for about 8 buyers can watch crowds set tanks on fire topple 
buses and surround jeeps of soldiers in desperate efforts to keep 
the army from reaching tiananmen square where the students were 
camped 
a narrator describes the action in english the rebels climb on 
an armored vehicle and open it this is rampant counterrevolutionary 
arrogance a group of thugs goes on beating smashing 
plundering and burning 
the tape shows no footage of soldiers opening fire nor does it 
mention that they did and it does not contain the sound of chanting 
protesters or gunfire 
the government has been distributing the tape internally and 
among its foreign embassies it has not yet appeared for sale in 
beijing stores but all the footage was shown repeatedly on national 
television in the days after the crackdown 
along with the copies sold to foreigners came a note complete 
with official seal asking customs officials to allow it out of the 
country authorities have been confiscating private tapes and 
photographs showing the violence 
beijing tourism officials said they have sold 60 copies of the 
tape which they hope will silence foreign criticism of the 
crackdown and encourage foreign businessmen and tourists to return

a senior state department official left friday 
on a fournation visit to central america for talks expected to 
focus on the situation in nicaragua and panama us officials said 
bernard aronson the newly installed assistant secretary of state 
for interamerican affairs planned to visit guatemala honduras el 
salvador and costa rica 
the officials who asked not to be identified said aronson would 
discuss preparations in nicaragua for national elections next feb 
25 the bush administration has accused the sandinista government of 
trying to rig the process in its favor 
but sen chris dodd dconn chairman of the senate foreign 
relations subcommitttee on latin america said thursday he expects 
the nicaraguan elections will be free and fair and that the 
sandinista goverment deserves some credit from the bush 
administration 
the consultations on panama are expected to center on next 
wednesdays meeting of organization of american states foreign 
ministers in washington 
the ministers are scheduled to receive a report from a team of 
mediators who have been trying to achieve a democratic transfer of 
power in panama in accordance with an oas mandate 
according to the officials aronson briefed a number of latin 
american ambassadors on thursday about the situation in panama 
aronson told the envoys that the bush administration consistent 
with latin american wishes has adopted a low profile on the panama 
situation in the interest of seeking a resolution of the problem 
through hemispheric consensus the officials said 
aronson also said it would be unfortunate for the oas if the 
mediators failed to achieve a solution in panama that would result 
in the transfer of power from gen manuel antonio noriega the 
commander of the defense forces to an elected civilian government 
the officials said 
at his news conference thursday dodd criticized the oas for what 
he said was its ineffective response to the situation in panama 
if the oas cannot deal with the panama problem i dont think 
we can get together on anything he said they might as well 
close down the oas building 
panama has faced an uncertain political future since the results 
of the may 7 national elections were thrown out by panamanian 
authorities independent observers had maintained that the 
presidential candidate opposed to noriega scored a landslide victory

a former housing and urban development official 
today contradicted onetime hud secretary samuel pierces sworn 
statement that he played no direct role in deciding which housing 
projects received hud financing 
shirley mcvay wiseman former general deputy assistant secretary 
for housing said pierce called her and instructed her to approve 
millions of dollars for a durham nc project sought by pierces 
former law partner 
wiseman said pierces exact words to her were i want the 
project funded 
i cant fund it but i will send it upstairs to you wiseman 
said she told pierce 
as a result of huds approval the developers received more than 
113 million in rent subsidies a 23 million urban development 
action grant and more than 3 million in tax credits said rep tom 
lantos chairman of the house government operations subcommittee on 
unemployment and housing 
janet hale who succeeded wiseman at hud testified that on her 
first day on the job she was directed by deborah gore dean 
pierces executive assistant to forward the funding documents 
on the north carolina project 
however hale said that pierces signature was already on the 
documents approving funding for the project 
pierce testified before the house panel in may that he had no 
direct role in hud funding decisions since then however there 
have been reports that pierce intervened on behalf of associates 
including the onetime law partner former durham mayor charles 
markham who was seeking hud financing for the north carolina 
project 
both former hud aides testified under oath as had pierce earlier 
pierce who has returned to the practice of law and business 
pursuits in manhattan has been recalled by the panel for further 
questioning but no date has been set for his appearance 
sources told the associated press on thursday that dean who for 
three years was pierces top aide sought immunity from prosecution 
in exchange for her testimony implicating pierce however 
congressional sources said lantos hoped to gain that information 
independent of ms dean 
the granting of immunity is not under active consideration by 
the subcommittee lantos said today 
ms dean last month refused to answer questions from the 
subcommittee invoking her fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination one of the sources said that if granted 
immunity ms dean was prepared to testify that pierce ordered 
funding for numerous projects under the section 8 moderate 
rehabilitation program 
the program was suspended briefly earlier this year and its 
selection guidelines rewritten after hud auditors criticized project 
selections auditors said influential republicans had successfully 
lobbied hud officials in favor of projects involving their clients 
ms wiseman has said she quit her job as huds assistant 
secretary for housing because pierce ordered her to fund the north 
carolina project over the objections of other agency officials 
pierce replaced ms wiseman with ms hale now a specialist in 
the office of management and budget who in 1985 approved funding 
for the project 
wiseman also testified that she was lobbied by carla hills 
president fords hud secretary on behalf of drg funding corp the 
largest private lender that underwrote mortgages in a 5 billion hud 
coinsurance program drg at the time was on probation ms wiseman 
said ms hills went over her head to pierce after failing to 
convince her that the restrictions should be lifted 
it was later brought to my attention that hills had taken 
the case to secretary pierce i was informed by staff that there was 
a meeting and drgs probation was lifted she said 
drg now is the subject of an fbi criminal investigation and hud 
officials believe the government may lose as much as 500 million 
because of drgs handling of governmentbacked loans 
new hud secretary jack kemp said earlier this week that abuses at 
the agency during the reagan administration the period of pierces 
tenure cost hud in the ballpark of 2 billion 
a kemp aide said thursday that more than half of that amount 
11 billion was believed to have been lost by just one program a 
coinsurance venture administered by huds federal housing 
administration 
meanwhile the washington post reported today that hud hired 
attorney peter e novick to head a program that had losses three 
years earlier estimated at 240000 the paper said the losses 
occurred because novick made false statements working as a 
settlement attorney in real estate transactions from 1982 to 1984 
novick 47 pleaded guilty may 25 in us district court to one 
count of making a false statement and has been ordered to report in 
midaugust to a halfway house to serve a oneyear sentence the 
paper said 
novick had worked for hud as an attorney before going into 
private practice he was rehired by hud in february 1987 after 
talking with thomas demery then assistant secretary for housing 
in other developments thursday 
the senate banking committee voted to launch its own hud 
investigation 
that committee also approved the nomination of francis a 
keating ii as huds general counsel a post that will have a key 
role in agency dealings with investigations by law enforcement 
agencies 
an aide to the lantos subcommittee said us trade 
representative carla hills who was hud secretary during the ford 
administration will appear before the panel next week to face 
questions about her lobbying of hud officials after she left the 
agency 
a houstonarea lawyer acknowledged he has been barred from doing 
business with the federal government because he was slow in turning 
over some 15 million from sales of hud property attorney larry e 
thomas said he had not kept any money and a hud official confirmed 
that almost all the money had been recovered

just like paris this hamlet 
deep in winegrowing burgundy went out of its way to make its 
bicentennial celebration an unparalleled event 
unlike parisians however the 548 villagers could get a close 
look at the fireworks display the first ever in the history of st 
gengoux they also had no trouble parking and didnt complain about 
the cost of it all 
that doesnt mean the festivities were a cinch for mayor joseph 
pelletier 
we had worries to organize this he said for the official 
toast we had to get our hands on 200 glasses and think who would do 
the washing up afterward 
with all eyes glued on paris where world leaders marked the 200th 
anniversary of the french revolution in pomp splendor and grandeur 
hundreds of villages around france celebrated with a simple bal 
populaire and heaps of food and wine 
on the eve of bastille day the children of st gengoux marched 
around the village carrying colorful lanterns the elders dressed 
in period costumes followed and chanted revolutionary slogans such 
as thats enough well hang the aristocracy and down with 
the nobility and clergy when they passed the 11th century church 
but times have changed 
st gengoux no longer has a resident priest the sole policeman 
did not have to protect anyone from the outrage of the people and 
by 330 am the locals were swaying to rock around the clock by 
bill haley and the comets 
one thing was missing though for the first time in memory the 
brass band rich in trophies and local history did not lead the 
procession 
after the previous mayor lost the march elections his son and 
cousin quit the band taking with them their bugle and big drum 
what a pity we had to miss that said pelletier echoing the 
complaints of many villagers 
but it hardly dampened the enthusiasm during the simple 
festivities here everything is very down to earth said baker 
jeannot breton we celebrate among ourselves we dont have an 
orgy of money he said 
the mayor runs the july 14 celebrations on a budget of less than 
1500 of course we dont have to receive heads of state he 
said 
st gengoux basking amid the lush sloping hills of eastern 
france produces simple macon white wines from chardonnay grapes 
but without the fame or prices of the burgundy wines from around 
beaune 40 miles to the north 
fridays celebrations ended with the bicentennial repas 
populaire a rich fivecourse meal for about 750 a plate but 
with wine and coffee offered by the village more than 200 people 
showed up in the salle des fetes decorated in the french colors for 
the occasion 
during the two days only one big speech was made but even then 
it hardly resembled the heady rhetoric heard in paris where the 
revolution was lauded as one of frances greatest contributions to 
humanity 
the people here have their ideas what 1789 means in st gengoux 
there were attacks during the revolutionary summer to destroy 
everything that represented the nobility and clergy but no major 
massacres occured 
like everywhere july 14 means liberty we have maintained it 
and even abused it a lot breton said referring to frances 
colonial past when something is forbidden we are the first to do 
it he said 
the quest for an egalitarian society however has partly failed 
said pelletier the differences are still there but they are not 
so big as 200 years ago he said some privileges have 
survived he said 
st gengoux will continue to celebrate until the end of july to 
commemorate events in the region itself 
on july 14 nothing happened here said pelletier there 
was no television to see live how the bastille was taken

north korea on friday accused the un 
command of infiltrating its waters with three south korean combat 
vessels june 23 to provoke another korean war 
north korean army maj gen choe ui ung speaking at a meeting of 
the korean military armstice commission also said south korean 
troops opened fire june 28 at a communist guard post along the 
demilitarized zone that separates the two countries 
he said the incidents were part of an effort to increase tensions 
and prepare for a new war on the korean peninsula and said south 
korea was stockpiling arms no casualties were reported in the 
incidents 
the commission meeting held in the truce village of panmunjom 
had been called by north korea 
us navy rear adm larry g vogt senior delegate of the un 
command rejected north koreas charges as fabrications and 
fiction aimed at propaganda 
vogt said his command investigated the claims and the charges 
were unfounded north korea earlier reported the incidents in a 
radio broadcast and a message 
vogt said he had proposed a joint investigation but the communist 
side did not respond 
the un command led by the united states was formed at the 
start of the 195053 korean war to help south korea repel communist 
invaders the joint armistice commission is charged with maintaining 
the ceasefire that ended the war and meets periodically at the 
request of either side 
choe alleged the united states deploys more than 1000 nuclear 
weapons in south korea and has recently brought in modern jet 
fighters he also charged that the command conducted more than 800 
reconnaissance flights over north korea this year 
on the alleged arms buildup vogt said the command has been 
forced to take firm actions in selfdefense since 1957 when he 
said the command temporarily suspended a section of the armistice 
agreement which bans the introduction of reinforcing weapons he 
said this was done in order to counter north koreas arms buildup 
choe did not respond 
also friday south koreas largest opposition party accused 
president roh taewoo of political suppression and urged his 
government to scrap plans to question opposition leader kim daejung 
lawmakers from kims party for peace and democracy joined forces 
in demanding intelligence agents stop harassing the party head and 
withdraw a request to question him about a party lawmakers illegal 
trip to north korea 
the agency for national security planning has asked to question 
kim and other senior party members in connection with a secret trip 
to north korea in august by lawmaker suh kyungwon who has been 
arrested 
kim turned down two agency requests thursday and friday to answer 
questions saying he had nothing to tell about suhs trip 
trips to north korea without prior government approval are a 
crime in south korea which maintains all contacts and dialogue with 
pyongyang must be made through official channels

the roman catholic bishop of hong kong has 
appealed for international pressure on britain to offer refuge to 
the territorys people as a safeguard from the uncertain future 
under communist rule 
cardinal john b wu in a letter to about 2500 cardinals and 
bishops seen friday also urged pressure on china to end persecution 
of participants in the crushed prodemocracy movement 
britain has agreed to return hong kong to china in 1997 and 
beijing has promised that the territory can maintain its capitalist 
economy and enjoy a high degree of autonomy for another 50 years 
but the june 34 military suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing and subsequent crackdown on dissent throughout 
china has led to a loss of confidence in the future among the 57 
million people of hong kong 
these events have shaken not just china but the entire 
world wu said hong kong has felt particularly deeply the 
sufferings of its chinese brothers and sisters 
wu argued that recent events in china have increased anxieties in 
hong kong and he said london had a constitutional and moral 
obligation to provide safeguards for the territorys people 
a right to enter the united kingdom would in no small measure 
help restore peoples confidence in hong kong he said echoing 
arguments made by many of the colonys public opinion leaders 
wu appealed to his fellow churchmen to urge their governments and 
international bodies to use their influence with london to ensure 
that the people of hong kong enjoy all those safeguards from the 
united kingdom which are their right 
hong kong church spokesman rev louis ha said the right to live 
in the united kingdom was such a safeguard 
the british government however has stated it will grant the 
right of abode to only a fraction of hong kong people no details of 
the plan have been released 
wu also wrote emotionally about chinas crackdown on dissent 
calling it a reign of terror he urged church leaders to seek 
support for pressure on the beijing government to put an end to 
all persecution and ensure those who have already been arrested are 
given fair trials 
the letter also discussed another sensitive issue in hong kong 
the wave of vietnamese who have sailed from their communist homeland 
to this territory in search of a new life nearly 50000 boat 
people languish in local camps 
overseas resettlement of boat people has slowed down leading to 
a hong kong government decision to seek the repatriation of all 
vietnamese who fled their homeland for economic reasons 
hong kong is almost at the end of its tether and desperate to 
find a solution for this crisis wu wrote in his letter the 
cardinal asked for help in offering the vietnamese permanent homes 
as soon as possible in other countries 
nearly 270000 people in hong kong are roman catholic or about 5 
percent of the population the church wields much influence in the 
community as it runs almost 300 schools and many medical services

a pilot who miraculously survived an 800mile flight 
while he was unconscious had been shot through the abdomen at some 
point before he crashlanded in the bahamas and swam to rescuers 
police said today 
it was unquestionably a gunshot wound said hollywood police 
chief richard witt the surgeons at the hollywood hospital said 
there was a wound that passed through the left rib cage and the 
colon exited and struck him in the arm and exited again 
authorities have not recovered the smallcaliber gun that caused 
the wound and believe it went down with the plane 
authorities earlier had speculated that thomas root may have had 
a heart attack or inhaled carbon monoxide 
the chief said a powder burn indicated root was shot at close 
range but did not say it was selfinflicted 
thats all a matter of speculation right now he said 
there is always the possibility of a selfinflicted wound 
witt said that root could have been shot before takeoff but that 
the wound is believed to have occurred in the air a colleague at 
roots law firm described him as a gun collector 
military pilots who saw root in the plane didnt see anyone else 
aboard according to federal aviation administration spokesman fred 
farrar 
the national transportation safety board refused to confirm the 
police version of events but fbi agent william gavin also said root 
had suffered a gunshot wound an air safety investigator for the 
ntsb andrew alston said at a news conference that there was no 
conclusive evidence that roots injury was a gunshot wound although 
he acknowledged that there was a burn area around the wound 
alston said doctors had removed a very very small fragment of 
metal from root he said it would be analyzed to determine if it 
was part of a bullet 
root remained in stable condition under heavy sedation at 
hollywoods memorial hospital today 
his odyssey started on a flight from washington to rocky mount 
nc and ended when he crashed after his singleengine plane ran 
out of fuel 10000 feet above bahamian waters early thursday 
afternoon 
for nearly four hours military jets shadowed the cessna 210 
centurion as it traveled down the east coast on autopilot with the 
36yearold lawyer from alexandria va slumped in the cockpit 
i thought there was no way he was going to survive that 
crash said air force staff sgt scott tracy one of four 
specially trained rescuers who parachuted to the crash site about 
15 miles east of the island of eleuthera and nearly 800 miles from 
his planned destination 
wearing only pants and socks root managed to swim clear of the 
craft minutes before it sank in nearly 10000 feet of water 
coast guard capt james rahman a doctor who treated root in 
nassau bahamas said root may have been jarred awake by the impact 
and flood of water 
its definitely a miracle hes alive hes a little confused by 
it all the doctor said i asked him what happened he said he 
didnt know he said he passed out in the plane and the next thing 
he knew water was coming in and he was sinking 
rahman who found no signs of a heart attack and said root had no 
history of diabetes had speculated that the veteran pilot may have 
passed out from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit 
but even before the gunshot wound was reported the federal 
official leading an investigation into the incident challenged that 
theory 
i personally dont think carbon monoxide was the cause said 
george prellezo regional director of the national transportation 
safety boards miami office if he was exposed to carbon monoxide 
for that length of time there would be more medical problems 
there are still a lot of unanswered questions 
prellezo said there are no plans to search for remains of the 
plane 
there initially were plans to interview root at the hospital 
today but alston of the ntsb said the interview was postponed until 
at least saturday because of roots sedation 
alston said the bahamian government has authority over the case 
but has asked the ntsb to run the investigation the fbi announced 
that it was joining the investigation 
there are many questions ill be asking alston said 
a paralegal who works at roots firm in washington said he may 
have been carrying guns in the plane 
mr root is a gun collector and ive been under the impression 
that he has been involved in selling some of his guns said signe 
schilperoort my assumption is that he had some guns in the 
plane and something went off when the plane went down 
hospital spokeswoman cynthia wine said roots family had 
requested that no information be released on the exact extent of his 
injuries root underwent 90 minutes of exploratory surgery thursday 
roots wife kathy 35 planned to visit her husband today on 
thursday she said she told hospital officials to send her husband 
the message root you really did it this time 
she told reporters thursday night that he had suffered a fainting 
spell about two months ago she also said he had often flown private 
planes on business trips 
for him to survive a crash like that it just sent us all into 
shock said petty officer veronica cady a coast guard 
spokeswoman we didnt expect this story to have a happy ending 
nearly two hours after root took off from washington national 
airport about 630 am he radioed air traffic controllers in 
virginia that he was having chest pain and trouble breathing 
yessir were having a little problem up here seem to have a 
little trouble breathing said root to an unidentified controller 
according to tapes broadcast on wrctv in washington 
moments later radio contact was broken 
military pilots who tailed the plane reported the craft 
occasionally moved within 100 miles of the shore and was traveling 
at more than 150 miles an hour 
seven military aircraft and a navy frigate were pressed into 
service as thousands of americans followed the ordeal with 
minutebyminute radio bulletins 
the plane began to lose altitude about 250 miles southeast of 
miami and quickly dropped to 7000 feet 
coast guard lt commander gary poll said the plane then spiraled 
down at about 2000 feet per minute the nose and left wing hit the 
water and the plane swiveled on its belly on a 360degree spin it 
sunk a few minutes later 
moments after impact the fourmember air force team from the 
301st aerospace rescue and recovery squadron parachuted 3000 feet 
above the crash site 
root clung to a raft tossed from the air force plane 
he was just barely hanging on said rescue team member tech 
sgt dave dahl it was remarkable to see someone with that 
tenacity to live ill never forget the sight of seeing him alive

through a pair of lunches and a dinner an opera and 
a parade leaders of two dozen poor nations rubbed elbows and 
clinked glasses with the heads of the seven wealthiest democracies 
but frances bicentennial ball ended friday and the poorer relations 
turned back into pumpkins 
it was all the doing of french president francois mitterrand who 
scheduled the 15th annual economic summit of industrialized nations 
to coincide with the 200th anniversary of the french revolution 
for a day and a half the seven summiteers mingled with the other 
world leaders who had been invited to the bicentennial festivities 
but the summit officially opened friday and fridays dinner was for 
members only 
while mitterrand hosted and toasted his rich counterparts 
frances other guests were shunted off to be entertained by premier 
michel rocard and the presidents wife danielle 
the logistical necessity of veering the big seven from the 
bicentennial festivities and into the economic summit caused no 
little embarrassment for mitterrand and his government there seemed 
no way to do it without appearing to be handing out secondclass 
tickets to the little guys 
mitterrand the advocate of the poor as his aides repeat 
ceaselessly counts among his guests for the bicentennial party 
some of the planets most economically strapped countries such as 
bangladesh and the most deeply indebted such as brazil and mexico 
some of the summit participants including the united states 
britain and west germany were adamantly opposed to mixing the two 
events to the point where the economic summit became a major 
northsouth event 
though debt will be one of the main topic of the summit the 
richer countries want to keep to the original economic summit 
framework created by former french president valery giscard 
destaing in 1975 
the summits have grown considerably beyond the informal economic 
chats giscard envisaged for that first event at rambouillet but the 
principal task remains keeping the worlds seven locomotive 
economies perking along in good order and in turn helping the less 
healthy 
nonetheless the proximity of the northsouth leaders afforded a 
golden opportunity for sleevetugging by the poor and 
largessdispensing by the rich 
we have not tried to organize a northsouth summit said 
jacques attali special counsellor to mitterrand and the main 
organizer of the summit on the other hand on july 12 13 and 14 
there will be northsouth meetings at the summit level 
in the framework of the bicentennial celebrations the summit 
participants and the leaders of the small nations attended a lavish 
lunch together on thursday dined as a group in the evening and at 
lunch again friday 
they sat sidebyside at the opening of the new bastille opera 
house on thursday and again at fridays military parade where 
george bush leader of the worlds wealthiest nation had a seat in 
the reviewing stand next to hossain mohammed ershad the president 
of bangladesh 
they will be all together attali repeated again and again at 
presummit press briefings they will participate in all the 
ceremonies together they will have numerous bilaterial meetings 
that is until the summit began 
enter the dinner flap 
originally the summit participants were to have their first meal 
alone at the french admiralty with the other bicentennial guests 
dining at the crillon hotel on place de la concorde as 
embarrassment mounted however the plans were changed and both

government officials and usbacked rebels 
will resume peace talks sunday in the zairean capital of kinshasa a 
newspaper reported 
without identifying its sources the stateowned jornal de angola 
said friday the talks originally were to start saturday but were 
postponed to allow zairean president mobutu sese seko to return from 
paris where he has been attending bicentennial celebrations of the 
french revolution 
mobutu was named mediator of a commission to negotiate an end to 
angolas 14year civil war at a june 22 african summit where angolan 
president jose eduardo dos santos and rebel leader jonas savimbi 
agreed to a ceasefire and peace talks 
dos santos called a government delegation home from kinshasa two 
weeks ago after only two days of talks with the guerrilla national 
union for the total independence of angola claiming the rebels 
violated the june 24 ceasefire 
the decision to resume comes on the heels of a threeday visit to 
luanda by herman cohen assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs who apparently encouraged dos santos to reopen talks 
according to jornal de angola next weeks talks will focus on 
the integration of guerrillas into angolan society and institutions 
african diplomats in angola say the talks probably will deal with 
ways of policing the truce 
government reports have said guerrillas cut power lines to the 
capital and killed civilians in a number of attacks breaking the 
ceasefire the rebels have said both sides have committed minor 
violations 
the rebels voice of the black cockerel radio station monitored 
thursday in luanda said a rebel delegation already is in kinshasa 
waiting for the government 
angolas armed forces chief antonio dos santos franca was 
expected to head the government delegation that also is slated to 
include dos santos presidential secretary on defense and security 
jose maria 
the rapprochement follows a december regional accord under which 
south africa agreed to pull out of angola and namibia in return for 
the withdrawal of 50000 cuban troops helping angolas government 
fight the guerrillas 
angola is eager for membership of the international monetary fund 
and us recognition withheld since a marxistoriented government 
seized power after the country gained independence from portugal in 
1975 
washington has pledged to continue aid to the guerrillas 
estimated at 15 million a year during a twoyear period of 
national reconciliation

after searching seven years for one of the 
nations worst serial killers police say a former law student is a 
viable suspect in the green river slayings of 48 women and 
perhaps other killings in the northwest 
william jay stevens ii 38 who is serving a jail term for 
burglary was named in an affidavit made public thursday 
the affidavit was filed to obtain a warrant to search two of 
stevens residences in spokane 290 miles east of seattle 
records obtained thus far have failed to provide him with an 
alibi for any of the 49 suspected green river homicides or any of 
those in the cities of portland or spokane the affidavit said 
instead interviews and records have produced the following 
facts that tend to establish that stevens is a viable suspect in the 
green river homicides and possibly others in the pacific northwest 
while the affidavit said there were 49 murders linked to the 
green river serial killer king county capt bob evans commander of 
a task force investigating the case said today there were only 48 
police searched the residences wednesday producing an additional 
truckload of material including crime reports 1800 videotapes 
maps credit cards 14 police badges and two seattle police uniform 
shirts according to court documents 
evans said today that some of the videotapes were homemade and 
that others were commercially produced he declined to say what any 
of the tapes depicted 
forty to 50 cartons of confiscated materials arrived in seattle 
thursday afternoon and it could take a month or longer to sort 
through them police said 
the green river case involves the deaths of 40 women and the 
disappearance of at least eight others in washington state and 
oregon from 1982 to 1985 most of the victims were young and almost 
all were linked to prostitution early victims were found along or 
near the green river southeast of seattle 
the nationally syndicated television show manhunt aired a 
program on the slayings dec 8 it generated thousands of calls 
including one from a viewer who told police to check a thirdyear 
student at gonzaga university law school in spokane said king 
county capt bob evans commander of a task force investigating the 
case 
after finding stevens police found he had walked away from a 
seattle work release center in january 1981 before finishing a 
oneyear sentence for burglarizing a police equipment store 
stevens was rearrested jan 10 and is serving the rest of that 
burglary sentence plus an additional term for escape that will 
expire sept 25 in king county jail 
he has not been arrested or charged in connection with any of the 
green river killings 
the affidavit also said the basement of a house stevens owned 
near portland contained a secret room hidden behind a sliding 
bookcase the bookcase was activated by a switch on the wall or an 
electric garage door opener the home which stevens owned from 1981 
to 1985 was one of several residences he had during the period the 
affidavit said 
several people quoted in the affidavit said stevens said he liked 
pornography frequented prostitutes and carried photographs of 
mutilated women 
his father told the associated press his attorney had advised him 
not to speak with reporters stevens declined a visit from an ap 
reporter thursday night 
any allegations of bill being involved in that kind of a 
serious crime are purely ridiculous said craig beles one of 
stevens attorneys 
beles said he thinks the task force is grabbing at straws 
besides the green river slayings the affidavit said stevens may 
be linked to an unidentified number of bodies found along highways 
between portland ore and vancouver british columbia and from 
seattle to spokane 
after rearresting stevens police searched his room in his 
parents spokane home after finding that stevens owned a former 
patrol car from everett wash and had equipped it like a real 
police car the affidavit said 
investigators had speculated that the killer could be a cop or 
someone posing as a cop evans said 
during that search police also found credit card receipts that 
helped them trace stevens moves during the years of the green river 
killings 
the materials found in wednesdays searches at the parents home 
and at a rental home near gonzaga university did not include any 
clothing jewelry or other effects belonging to any of the green 
river victims most of whom were found naked there was no smoking 
gun evans said 
items seized included police records of sex crimes from portland 
in the affidavit police quoted friends of stevens saying he had 
tried to pass himself off as a policeman and cia agent who went on 
missions 
some said stevens would be hyperactive after these missions and 
acted very weird while coming down the affidavit said 
the 40page document said the task forcereceived several tips 
about stevens in 1986 including a call from oregon saying stevens 
told friends the green river killings were done for snuff films 
pornographic films that purport to show actual killings

expression and publishers sought profits from adventure stories and 
romances some of dubious taste popular among the general public

kathy root said she never gave up hope her 
husband would survive even as his small plane flew hundreds of 
miles out of control with pilot thomas root apparently unconscious 
in the cockpit 
police said today that root had been shot through the abdomen 
before his plane crashlanded in the atlantic near the bahamas 
hollywood fla police chief richard witt said root had been 
shot at close range but didnt say the wound was selfinflicted 
authorities earlier had speculated that root had suffered a heart 
attack or inhaled carbon monoxide 
fbi agent william gavin also said that root had been shot 
however the national transportation safety board refused to 
confirm the police version of events andrew alston an air safety 
investigator said there was no conclusive evidence that roots 
injury was a gunshot wound although he acknowledged there was a 
burn area around the wound 
alston said doctors had removed a very very small fragment of 
metal which would be analyzed to determine if it was part of a 
bullet 
mrs root who was en route to florida could not immediately be 
reached for comment about the police reports earlier roots family 
requested that memorial hospital in hollywood not release any 
information on his injuries 
root remained in stable condition today under heavy sedation 
after undergoing three hours of exploratory surgery 
signe schilperoort a paralegal at roots firm thomas l root 
pc said today that root is a gun collection 
ive been under the impression that he has been involved in 
selling some of his guns she said my assumption is that he had 
some guns in the plane and something went off when the plane went 
down 
kevin quarles a researcher the firm said he was unaware of any 
problems facing root 
there was no outward appearance of any undue stress or any set 
of circumstances that would lead or contribute to as is being 
hinted at an apparent suicide attempt quarles said 
it was like a roller coaster mrs root 35 said thursday 
about the daylong wait before her husband was rescued after 
incredibly surviving the crash 
and her message to her husband i said to tell him root you 
really did it this time mrs root said she told hospital 
officials who called her from florida 
the 36yearold lawyer was flying his own plane to north carolina 
when he became ill his plane winged southward running out of fuel 
and crashing into the ocean where air force parachutists pulled him 
from the water 
this is somebody youve loved and lived with a long time the 
suddenness of it is breathtaking awful said mrs root after her 
agonizing eight hours of uncertainty it was very exhausting very 
difficult to deal with 
mrs root said she first heard her husbands flight was in 
trouble around 8 am when air traffic control officials called to 
say they had not heard from him 
she said she was updated throughout day about the status of plane 
and eventually saw tv pictures of her husband being pulled from the 
water 
mrs root who celebrated her 10th wedding anniversary last week 
said she never gave up hope her husband would survive 
i decided i was not going to believe he was dead until they 
told me he was dead she said 
but she said the hours of uncertainty were horrible awful 
its a terrible feeling 
coast guard capt dr james rahman said root may have passed out 
from carbon monoxide poisoning in the cockpit of his singleengine 
cessna and that water splashing in his face apparently roused him 
mrs root said she told only the oldest of their three children 
7yearold tj thomas what had happened and he took it very 
hard and was very sad and very elated when we found out he had been 
pulled out of the water 
the couples other two children leslie and travis are 4 and 1

three tamil tiger rebels met with 
moderate tamil leaders and fatally shot two of their hosts before 
they were killed by bodyguards officials said friday 
appapillai amirthalingam the leader of the tamil united 
liberation front and vettivelu yogeswaran a party colleague were 
killed thursday at their common residence in the city 
sarojini yogeswaran speaking friday before a court of inquiry 
told magistrate mohammed that she offered tea and biscuits to the 
three visitors 
they were having a friendly discussion for about 20 minutes and 
then we heard loud noises she said 
several people ran into the room and found the two tamil leaders 
lying in a pool of blood and heard more shooting outside she said 
police said all three assailants were shot and killed by 
bodyguards 
another tamil front leader murugesu sivasithamparam was 
seriously wounded in the shooting 
mrs yogeswaran named two of the visitors as visvu and aloysius 
and said they were tamil tigers from vavuniya 135 miles north of 
colombo 
a statement friday from the tamil tigers however denied 
involvement in the murders and said the suggestions had emanated 
from the indian high commission or embassy 
we deny categorically the reports emanating from indian high 
commission in colombo that one of the members of the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam was involved in the killings the statement 
said 
an indian high commission spokesman who cannot be identified 
under briefing rules denied the mission had suggested a tamil tiger 
involvement perhaps it is only their guilty conscience 
speaking he said refusing to elaborate 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people the 
rebels claim tamils are discriminated against by the sinhalese who 
make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and 
the military 
the tamil united liberation front has differed with demands by 
the government and the tiger rebels that indian soldiers posted on 
the island nation be withdrawn 
the demand followed talks in may between the rebels and the 
government the first direct contact between the two sides since the 
tamil tigers launched a war for an independent nation in 1983 
amirthalingam in public statements welcomed the demand but said 
the withdrawal should be gradual and done only after political 
powers were given to the tamils india has said it will pull out its 
estimated 40000 troops after this condition is met 
amirthalingam a lawyer was elected to parliament in 1956 his 
party became the second largest group in parliament after the 1977 
elections but was relegated to the background after the tamil tigers 
launched their militant movement 
india became involved in sri lankas ethnic problems because its 
own 60 million tamils are sympathetic to the rebel cause

the fbi said today it is conducting a 
preliminary investigation of alleged financial fraud at an energy 
department plant in ohio that makes materials for nuclear weapons 
edwin boldt an fbi spokesman in cincinnati said the probe was 
unrelated to the energy departments decision to launch on thursday 
its own investigation of environmental controls and other operations 
at the feed materials production center one of the key contributors 
to us nuclear weapons production 
the plant is situated at fernald about 18 miles north of 
cincinnati 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary said in an interview 
that his department had not been notified of the justice department 
probe which marks the third time in recent weeks that fbi agents 
have entered federal nuclear facilities 
pete kelley a spokesman for westinghouse materials co of ohio 
which operates the plant under an energy department contract said 
he was unaware of the fbi inquiry 
westinghouse announced earlier this week it was shutting down 
production indefinitely in order to focus more work on cleaning up 
the sites hazardous wastes 
westinghouse said the shutdown decision was unrelated to the 
energy department probe 
will callicott a department spokesman said today the shutdown 
was temporary and would not interfere with normal weapons production 
schedules he said the shutdown decision was made by westinghouse 
alone and that he could not comment on how long it might last 
boldt said in a telephone interview that the fbi investigation 
was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing in contracting 
of the fernald plant work he declined to identify either the origin 
of the allegation the date of its receipt by the fbi or the 
specific nature of the alleged fraud 
he also declined to say whether the charge was against an 
employee of the energy department westinghouse or another 
contractor at the site 
it could concern any level of the whole contract process he 
said from the granting of contracts to their execution 
callicott said he was not sure whether the department had been 
informed of the fbi investigation and had no immediate comment 
boldt said he believed it was the first such fbi inquiry at the 
fernald plant and added that the investigators had not yet 
determined whether a crime had been committed 
he stressed that the inquiry had no connection to the plants 
production facilities 
theres no physical danger involved it involves paperwork 
boldt said 
the plant processes uranium compounds produces uranium billets 
for nuclear weapons production and makes uranium target elements for 
defense nuclear reactors 
fbi agents in june raided an energy department weapons production 
center in colorao in search of evidence of criminal violations in 
the storage of hazardous wastes and the bureau on july 6 opened a 
similar probe at a department facility in new york states 
callicott said there was nothing to report on the departments 
own investigation at fernald which is focusing on health and safety 
measures documentation permits planning and management he said 
it would last about a month and a half

rain and higher humidity helped firefighters whip blazes in six 
western states and a new mexico fire that polluted a creek with ash 
forced biologists to rescue hundreds of endangered fish in 
longhandled nets 
officials said 566 gila trout were fished out of diamond creek in 
southwestern new mexico put in containers on mules and horses 
loaded onto trucks and brought to the mescalero fish hatchery 
the trout will stay there until the creek rises and becomes 
ashfree 
they were in good shape said toby martinez a us forest 
service range and wildlife staff officer for the gila national 
forest 
officials hoped at least 90 percent would survive 
much of the creek was contaminated by ash from the 
lightningcaused divide fire which started june 30 and burned about 
10000 acres 150 miles southwest of albuquerque said forest service 
spokeswoman andrea garcia the fire was contained monday and should 
be controlled within four days ms garcia said 
martinez said rescuers used electric shockers to stun the fish 
then netted them when a fish is stunned it comes to the surface 
gila trout once were widespread throughout mountain streams in 
the gila river basin of southwestern new mexico but the habitat was 
ruined because of wood cutting overgrazing and irrigation the 
trout was placed on the federal endangered species list in 1967 
lightning sparked three small fires thursday and today but 
firefighters were extinguishing them today said willie zapata us 
forest service dispatcher in gila 
in california 1500 firefighters aided by light wind and higher 
humidity thursday had circled 70 percent of an arson fire that has 
charred more than 3000 acres of scenic california coastline near 
big sur firefighters said they were unable to make progress 
overnight 
they hoped to have the 6dayold fire contained by late today 
but authorities were concerned that higher temperatures could hamper 
their efforts a brush fire accidentally started by marine corps 
tracer fire continued burning out of control today after charring at 
least 3000 acres at camp pendleton a base spokesman said 
firefighters on thursday said they had contained the 2000acre 
livermore fire west of fort collins colo in roosevelt national 
forest the last of three major fires in colorado to be encircled by 
firefighters 
seven 20person crews fighting the fire were to be reduced to 
three crews officials said 
earlier firefighters contained the black tiger fire which 
covered 2000 acres in boulder canyon and destroyed dozens of homes 
and halted a 2600acre fire in mesa verde national monument in 
southwestern colorado 
arizona firefighters mopped up hot spots in several small fires 
and only one blaze in the state was not fully contained the 
stubborn horton fire burning beneath the mogollon rim had grown to 
300 acres but officials expected to have it contained by late 
saturday 
in northwest nebraska members of a volunteer fire department and 
a few national guardsmen stood by the smoldering remains of a blaze 
that charred 48000 acres of the pine ridge the fire which raged 
for four days and destroyed 14 unoccupied structures was contained 
wednesday and officials predicted it would be controlled soon 
forest officials in nebraska shifted their attention thursday 
from firefighting to seeding grass and planting trees the blaze 
blackened acres of ponderosa pine trees many of them 60 to 80 years 
old said us forest service fire staff officer jim carson 
carson hoped for rain 
my experience is that wed see green grass again if we get 
enough moisture say a halfinch of rain he said 
rains helped firefighters in western wyoming forests the storms 
dampened a fire in bridgerteton national forest that had burned 
nearly 3500 acres 
its been real quiet said dick heninger a ranger in the 
forests pinedale office it looks better all the time the way 
these clouds are coming in 
heninger said four crews will probably be released from the fire 
today leaving two to continue mopup work 
but one official with the wyoming interagency fire coordination 
center warned the break in the fire season will probably be 
shortlived 
as soon as it gets hot and dry again we will be right back in 
it said center spokesman greg warner for now anyway we are 
getting some relief

retail sales fell 04 percent in june dragged 
down by falling auto and home furnishing purchases the government 
reported friday and analysts said bigticket items would continue 
to bear the brunt of the antiinflation fight 
the decline in sales reflects that people are getting a little 
cautious about spending their money said david wyss senior 
financial economist for drimcgrawhill a lexington mass 
economic forecasting organization 
thats partially because theres been a lot of talk about the 
risk of recession and people are taking that seriously he 
explained 
robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago agreed 
saying the pocketbook hasnt been zipped up completely but its 
closed to a considerable degree 
rosalind wells chief economist for the national retail merchants 
association in new york noted the sales decline was concentrated in 
the durable goods area and predicted the pattern would continue for 
the remainder of the year because of high interest rates 
the commerce department reported that sales fell to a seasonally 
adjusted 1408 billion last month after dropping 01 percent in 
may it was the first backtoback monthly decline since 1987 when 
sales declined 08 percent in september and 09 percent in october 
retail spending is watched closly as a measure of the overall 
economy since it accounts for about a third of economic activity 
car sales which represent about 20 percent of total retail 
sales led the overall decline last month they fell 20 percent 
following a 18 percent drop in may it was the steepest fall since 
a 40 percent decline in october 1987 
however dederick and michael evans of evans economics inc of 
washington said auto sales have picked up since the june survey was 
taken 
some analysts said the latest retail sales report would provide 
the federal reserve additional incentive to lower interest rates as 
it seeks a softlanding rather than drive the economy into a 
recession as it fights inflation 
its not a question of whether the fed will ease further 
said david jones an economist for aubrey g lanston amp co in new 
york its only a matter of when 
until recently interest rates have risen as the fed tightened 
its grip on credit to slow the economy and stem inflation while 
rates have begun to fall they are still high enough to affect 
spending on durable goods bigticket items expected to last more 
than three years 
durable goods sales were off 13 percent in june after falling 
05 percent in may commerce said besides autos sales of furniture 
and other home furnishings were off 01 percent 
sales of nondurable goods rose 02 percent including a 21 
percent increase in department store and other general merchandise 
spending and a 19 percent hike in clothing sales 
the one shining light will continue to be apparel 
particularly womens clothing said ms wells of the national retail 
merchants association its the only area where theres pentup 
demand she said following several years when women postponed 
purchases because they didnt like the style or whatever 
nondurable categories posting sales declines included food 
stores down 07 percent gasoline stations down 05 percent 
restaurants and bars down 02 percent and drug stores off 03 
percent 
retail sales were up 53 percent from april through june 
compared with the same period in 1988

rival moslem sects in the central asian republic of 
tadzhikistan fought over water and land rights and one person was 
killed and 18 were wounded tass reported friday 
thousands of people some with guns clashed thursday night 
between the villages of vorukh and chorku in the isfara region the 
traditional site of rivalries between iranianspeaking and 
turkicspeaking moslems 
tass the official soviet news agency said communist party first 
secretaries of the neighboring republics of kirghizia and 
tadzhikistan rushed to the scene to calm things down 
elsewhere in the soviet union ethnic tension continued to run 
high in nagornokarabakh and georgia in the caucasus mountains 
according to reports reaching moscow 
the violence continued as preparations continued for a communist 
party central committee meeting in late july on nationality problems 
that have erupted under the liberalizing reforms of president 
mikhail s gorbachev authorities have not announced a date for the 
plenum 
the latest violence in soviet central asia stems from an old 
dispute about land and water use at isfara in leninabad oblast on 
the border between kirghizia and tadzhikistan 
the border near the disputed area is jagged as authorities 
gerrymandered along ethnic lines when they carved the republics from 
the former tsarist province of turkestan in the 1920s 
cooperative use of an irrigation canal at isfara ended at the 
beginning of this year when the disputing parties filled it with 
stones causing substantial agricultural losses tass reported 
the situation worsened the last three months as local authorities 
decided to build additional settlements in the area without 
undertaking the necessary consultations with residents on water 
and energy supplies it said 
in stepanakert capital of the nagornokarabakh autonomous 
region armenian residents circulated a photograph of an armenian 
watchman killed at a livestock complex wednesday night in the nearby 
town of shush said a worker at the state radio and television 
committee there 
his throat was slit and his eyes were cut out said the 
worker an armenian who declined to identify himself 
demonstrations began nearly two years ago in nagornokarabakh and 
the neighboring republic of armenia to protest the administration of 
the enclave by the azerbaijani republic nagornokarabakh lies 
within azerbaijan a predominately moslem republic but the majority 
are armenian christians 
no one has been arrested for the most recent murder although 
investigators have been sent to the region and interior ministry 
troops have been patrolling all week according to official reports 
in the nearby republic of georgia the situation remained tense 
in the town of marneuli said roland beridze of the georgian 
ministry of foreign affairs five people were hurt in a june 25 
disturbance in marneuli but the exact nature of the problem has not 
been reported by the soviet media

you are 5 years old you are in the hospital and 
about to have surgery for bronchial complications when the child in 
the next bed offers this advice dont cough during surgery or 
youll die 
it happened to ann banks 30 years ago and the memory of that 
moment lingered and sparked the first in a series of books aimed at 
helping kids 8 to 12 years old cope with uncomfortable situations 
the books hospital journal a kids guide to a strange place 
and alone at home a kids guide to being in charge were 
published in june by viking penguin 
there are plenty of story books already out on both of these 
situations but sometimes telling a story just isnt enough or its 
too much the author said in a recent interview 
banks uses a workbook format which allows children to write 
things down learn about them and hopefully gain control of the 
situation 
each year she says about 4 million children enter the hospital 
for an overnight stay for many it is their first hospital visit 
banks recalled that at age 5 she didnt know whether to believe 
her roommates startling claim about the danger of coughing but i 
sure remember being too afraid to ask anyone she said 
as a result the hospital book includes a page titled will it 
hurt and urges readers to ask their doctors and parents to 
describe exactly what will happen to them before during and after 
surgery 
the bood also includes sections on getting to know doctors and 
nurses where children ask their medical people about their favorite 
television shows their hobbies and about why they chose their 
profession 
this way they learn something personal about these people and 
hopefully feel more at ease around them banks said 
banks talked to scores of teenagers doctors nurses guidance 
counselors and specialists 
a section of the hospital book dealing with privacy or more 
accurately the lack of it grew from the interviews with teens 
the kids talked a lot about how embarrassing it was when the 
nurse didnt close the curtain enough or they had to be helped onto 
a bedpan the minute i heard it i knew it was important to 
them 
the result is a section called this is embarrassing which 
urges kids to talk about those indelicate times 
youngsters are encouraged to count the injections they receive 
to ask new people they meet to autograph the book to laugh at 
hospital jokes what do you call a sick alligator an illigator 
the second book alone at home asks children to list the 
locations of firstaid supplies the phone numbers of working 
parents and special people neighbors who a child can turn to 
if problems arise 
with more women working fulltime some experts estimate there 
are 6 million socalled latchkey kids who come home from school 
daily to empty houses 
you tell a child youll be home a certain time and then stop 
off at the grocery store or run some other errand that makes you 15 
minutes late those few extra minutes can seem like a very long time 
for a kid 
each book concludes with a parents guide parents are asked to 
work with their kids in completing the workbooks rehearsing what 
they should do if they lose their keys or if someone knocks at the 
door 
banks who lives in manhattan and is the mother of 5yearold 
kate plans two more books for the series one on divorce and the 
other on living in stepfamilies

mayor marion barry jr disclosed plans to seek 
a new term thursday despite an 11year administration punctuated by 
scandal in a decision complicating the political future of jesse 
jackson 
barry 53 said through an aide that he will run for reelection 
in 1990 and expects jacksons support the announcement ended months 
of speculation about whether a combination of personal woes and the 
citys crime and budget difficulties would discourage barry from 
running for an unprecedented fourth term 
jackson had disclosed plans earlier in the week to move to 
washington by sept 1 and he had done nothing to discourage 
speculation that he was eyeing the mayors chair although aides 
said he would not run against barry an old ally from civil rights 
days 
but the twotime democratic presidential contender quickly pulled 
back after barry spread word of his plans telling the detroit free 
press on thursday i have no plans to run for mayor 
ill be doing more and more work out of washington for the 
cause of the rainbow coalition he said of his political 
organization 
barry also a democrat was traveling to a national league of 
cities conference in minneapolis and was unavailable for comment 
jackson was en route from detroit to chicago and could not be 
reached 
jackson said in the newspaper interview our basic work 
whether its sameday voter registration or daycare legislation 
or our reinvestment plan or affordable housing is all kind of 
washingtoncentered it makes more sense for my wife and me to have 
a house there three or four days a week than to stay in a hotel 
in the past six months several of barrys top appointees have 
resigned a former top adviser has been indicted on fraud and 
conspiracy charges and the mayor himself has twice testified before 
a federal grand jury about ties to a man convicted of selling drugs 
in the virgin islands 
that man charles lewis is awaiting trial recently postponed 
to september on additional drug charges in washington he came 
under federal investigation after city police called off an attempt 
to make an undercover drug buy from him after learning barry was in 
lewis washington hotel room 
as for the mayors race one aide familiar with barrys political 
strategy said the disclosure of his plans was designed to keep 
jackson from gathering momentum in an unannounced campaign for 
mayor particularly in the event that the drug trial produced more 
unfavorable publicity for the mayor 
barry has been concerned that if jackson moves to washington and 
barry is damaged by the lewis trial jesse will gather a full head 
of steam and be unstoppable said the aide 
the mayor had planned to make his announcement in the fall the 
aide said 
jackson has never held elective office and a term as mayor was 
seen by some of his supporters as a way to add such experience to 
his political resume while avoiding a third run for the democratic 
presidential nomination at a time he seemed unlikely to win 
barry in addition to his personal problems is struggling with 
the citys murder rate and is having to deal with growing budget 
problems 
through friday 229 persons had been killed in washington in 
1989 70 more than at the same time last year a record 372 persons 
were killed in the district in 1988 and police blame more than 60 
percent of those deaths on drugs

in what government officials say is an 
unprecedented move chrysler corp is challenging the quality of 
medical care provided to dozens of injured workers at its nowclosed 
assembly plant here and is refusing to pay for it 
the care provided to workers by certain physicians in the 
kenosharacine area was inappropriate unreasonable and 
excessive said david a lewsley manager of workers compensation 
for the automaker 
chrysler has assured workers they wont be liable for unpaid 
bills and says its battle is with the doctors not with the workers 
treated 
a former united auto workers leader said the union approved of 
chryslers decision but a lawyer who represents some chrysler 
workers was critical of the move 
i think thats a tactic of the auto industry and its a blatant 
abuse of their employeremployee relations said kenosha attorney 
paul gagliardi they are potentially opening themselves up to 
substantial litigation 
gagliardi said chryslers refusal to pay workers compensation 
claims will only compound the pain of last years plant closing in 
which about 5000 workers were laid off 
lewsley said chrysler is refusing to pay 200 bills and is 
challenging an additional 300 submitted since dec 1 1988 he had 
no estimate of how many patients were involved but one doctor 
estimated it at 80 
the company began sending out letters to employees this week he 
said 
lewsley said chrysler is not questioning the employees injuries 
only the care provided by certain physicians all the cases involve 
onthejob injuries or illnesses 
lewsley said the automaker conducted an outside audit before 
determining that the medical bills were improper the automaker is 
selfinsured meaning it pays medical bills directly rather than 
buying insurance 
what we have is a pattern of bad practice and we feel a moral 
obligation to confront some of these bad practices lewsley 
said the dispute is between chrysler and the doctors and were 
trying to keep the employees out of this 
employees have been told that chrysler will pay the bills if it 
loses its challenge 
chrysler is also giving employees a list of suggested alternative 
doctors if they wish to leave the physician treating them lewsley 
said 
rudy kuzel a former leader of united auto workers local 72 said 
there have been rumors of poor medical care in kenosha for a decade 
and the union is glad that chrysler is finally investigating the 
allegations 
im pleased that everybody will finally have their day in 
court this type of thing has been going on in this community for 
the last 10 years he said 
he said he hoped the legal system would expose any doctors who 
are providing poor treatment and vindicate any physicians who have 
been unjustly tainted by rumors in the past 
chris m faulhaber jr administrator of the workers 
compensation division of the state department of industry labor and 
human relations said chryslers actions are precedentsetting 
because they challenge the reasonableness of care rather than just 
the cost 
theres an allegation of a tremendous amount of abuse and 
fraud he said 
lewsley declined to identify the doctors whose treatment is being 
challenged faulhaber said he believed about nine doctors were 
involved 
the associated press contacted several doctors in the kenosha 
area to see whether they had received payment from chrysler most 
declined to comment or said they did not know the status of chrysler 
claims because they leave their financial matters to their staff 
but dr jose kanshepolsky a neurosurgeon said he has not 
received any payments for treatment he provided chrysler workers 
over the last 18 months 
kanshepolsky said he has talked with other doctors and estimated 
chrysler has refused to pay the bills of at least 80 patients he 
said most of the doctors have been too busy to complain 
doctors are poor business people were too busy rendering care 
sometimes to fight this he said 
lewsley said chrysler is prepared to either present its 
information to an administrative law judge should an employee 
request a hearing or stage a legal battle should any doctors sue the 
automaker 
if a doctor feels he disagrees with our refusal he can directly 
challenge us in court lewsley said

soldiers are waiting in the hills 
on the streets and in the fields for another enemy attack on this 
ancient city that is already in ruins 
the opponents are definitely planning to attack kandahar city 
especially the airport said the military governor of kandahar 
province lt gen nurul haq ulumi 
kandahar a city of 300000 people about 70 miles from the 
pakistan border and 250 miles southwest of kabul already has been 
bombed and row after row of homes and stores are locked up 
the city has been the scene of some of the fiercest battles in 
the decadeold war between the sovietbacked government and the 
ussupported moslem guerrillas 
the guerrillas have been trying for more than 18 months to 
capture the city since may the afghan armed forces have been 
preparing for a major offensive by the guerrillas 
tanks manned by gunners are stationed throughout the city 
soldiers wait in wheat fields their rocket launchers ready to fire 
members of the local militia pass through the streets waving 
their kalikovs a shortbarreled highvelocity variant of the 
sovietmade kalashnikov rifle 
on kohimahi a strategic peak once used by the guerrillas to 
launch an attack swarms of government troops stand guard 
soviet and afghan officials have accused pakistan the base of 
the main seven guerrilla groups of massing 10000 to 15000 troops 
near the border to help the guerrillas or mujahedeen islamic holy 
warriors pakistan denies the charge 
we understand that this time the opponents will be aided in a 
big way by pakistan ulumi said thursday 
he said the government had received information that pakistan had 
massed 200 tanks and 40 fighter bombers at a base in the city of 
quetta 
we are holding our positions but if we are attacked we will go 
after them and there will be massive bloodshed he said 
capturing a city would give the guerrillas a base for the interim 
government they formed in pakistan in february 
the guerrillas who control most of the countryside have been 
trying since early march to seize the eastern city of jalalabad 
although the guerrillas captured several key outposts around 
jalalabad in the early days of the assault the government has held 
the city 
foreign defense experts in kabul doubt the guerrillas have the 
manpower or the firepower to launch another major attack on an 
afghan city but president najibs soldiers appear to be taking no 
chances 
even during the moslem holiday of eid aladha security posts 
around the city remained alert 
in anticipation of a renewed attack the government has deployed 
fresh troops to kandahar and stationed mig21 fighter bombers at its 
airport according to a senior afghan army officer speaking on 
condition of anonymity he declined to disclose specific figures

yusaku inoue sitting quietly friday on the 
stairs in front of his tiny beachfront restaurant sighed deeply and 
said it looks like my summer is over 
the 85yearold restaurant owner was among hundreds of shop 
owners hotel managers and restaurant operators in ito 60 miles 
southwest of tokyo whose business has been hurt by thousands of 
earthquakes and the eruption of an undersea volcano 
i have been running this place for over 40 years and business 
was never this bad he said 
since june 30 more than 22000 quakes have jolted the hot 
springs resort including more than 585 strong enough to be felt by 
humans twentyone people suffered minor injuries when two 
earthquakes registering 55 on the richter scale hit ito on sunday 
on thursday evening a volcano onthe ocean floor off ito erupted 
spewing white steam into the air 
the hundreds of hotels in the area are virtually empty although 
some of the rooms are being filled by reporters 
the irony is that this town earned its fame from its rich hot 
springs derived from volcanic activity said one middleaged shop 
owner speaking on condition of anonymity now the volcanic 
activity is hurting the tourism industry 
more earthquakes and volcanic tremors jolted the ito area on 
friday but no injuries were reported scores of dead fish and 
volcanic stones were scattered along the shore 
on an ordinary friday afternoon this beach is always packed 
and most restaurants around here are full said inoue but ive 
only had one customer so far today 
news reports friday said two undersea mounds were found near the 
eruption site a few miles from ito one was about 80 feet high and 
the other about 30 feet the reports said 
most of the 200 people who left their seaside houses after the 
eruption to spend the night in four buddhist temples and schools 
returned home friday but 43 schools in ito remained closed said 
masaaki mitsuhashi a spokesman for the city 
the governments coordinating committee for earthquake prediction 
said another eruption was highly likely to occur not only at the 
same spot but possibly at other locations 
when the 72000 residents began to experience temblors in recent 
weeks its 916 hotels and inns began receiving a stream of 
cancellations after the eruption thursday more than 95 percent of 
hotel reservations were canceled said hiroyuki yamashita of itos 
tourist bureau 
the japanese archipelago which is of volcanic origin is 
believed to have about 80 active volcanoes in january mount 
tokachi on japans northern island of hokkaido erupted several 
times

the national association of broadcasters on 
friday applauded a federal communications commission decision 
allowing small fm stations to double their signals and reach larger 
audiences 
nab president edward o fritts said the group strongly 
endorsed thursdays fcc decision to allow many socalled class a 
fm stations to boost their power from 3000 watts to 6000 watts 
about 500 of the nations 2000 class a fm stations most of 
which serve small communities could make the switch as early as 
dec 1 without causing interference problems for other stations 
another 800 or so stations will be able to apply for permission 
to change tower locations or to resolve other technical problems 
preventing an immediate power boost fcc spokesman jay jackson said 
friday the remaining stations wont be able to change 
were very pleased that the fcc authorized the doubling of 
power to many fm operations fritts said 
secondly the fcc wisely recognized that general 
acrosstheboard increases could do serious harm to the integrity of 
the fm spectrum the commissions casebycase consideration of 
additional power increase applications may alleviate any other 
interference problems that may be presented 
the commission said the increased power would allow the stations 
to provide better service to their listeners 
the commission also revised the distances by which class a 
stations must be separated from other stations to limit 
interference the current separation is 105 kilometers or about 65 
miles while the new separation will be 115 kilometers or about 71 
miles effective oct 2 
the area covered will be 40 percent greater jackson said 
class a fm stations are the most numerous of the fccs seven 
classes of fm stations and those that have the smallest service 
areas the largest fm stations have signals with 100000 watts or 
more 
the commission said the small communities to which class a 
channels were originally allotted have grown while the coverage of 
these stations has remained unchanged 
fcc chairman dennis patrick said he feared the new rule would 
exacerbate the commissions already backlogged application process 
adding that he hoped congress would allocate additional funds to the 
agency to handle the expected glut

wholesale prices fell in june for the first 
time in 18 months while retail sales recorded the first backtoback 
monthly declines since the 1987 stock market plunge the government 
said friday in new evidence of a national economic slowdown 
prices one stop short of retail as measured by the labor 
departments producer price index dropped 01 percent in june 
driven down by tumbling energy and food costs it was the first 
decline since december 1987 
meanwhile the commerce department reported that retail sales 
fell 04 percent in june the first consecutive drop since 
septemberoctober 1987 as spending remained sluggish for cars and 
other costly goods 
in a third report the federal reserve board said the operating 
rate for us factories mines and utilities fell from 838 percent 
in may to 835 percent last month evidence that manufacturers are 
cutting back in response to consumer restraint 
this is simply further confirmation of a clearcut slowing in 
the underlying pace of the economy said david jones an economist 
with aubrey g lanston amp co a government securities dealer in new 
york the handwriting is on the wall regarding inflation we will 
see a slowing for the remainder of the year 
but the inflation report provided mixed signals to the stock and 
bond markets where traders were uncertain whether the reports were 
weak enough to soon trigger another cut in interest rates by the 
federal reserve board 
economist robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago 
joked that it was a threehanded report on one hand the decline in 
the overall index was welcome news of a break in inflation on the 
other hand the socalled core inflation rate excluding the 
volatile food and energy categories jumped 07 percent the biggest 
rise in nearly three years but on the third hand most of the 
increase in the core rate was caused by an increase in prices for 
cigarettes and ships 
in the end what the fed is left with is a package of data 
which show a lackluster economy he said 
dederick and other analysts said the central bank which has 
engineered two quarterpoint drops in interest rates since early 
june likely would push interest rates down another notch before the 
end of the month 
it can happen anytime as far as i see it he said 
another move by the fed likely would prompt the nations banks to 
follow the lead of chase manhattan which already has cut its prime 
rate the benchmark for many adjustablerate consumer loans he said 
the fed fought inflation by pushing interest rates higher from 
march 1988 through march 1989 but since reversed course as evidence 
of economic sluggishness mounted 
the slight decline in wholesale prices last month followed a 
sharp jump of 09 percent in may and left the annual rate of 
inflation for the first six months of 1989 at 76 percent nearly 
double last years rise of 4 percent 
energy costs which had soared more than 20 percent over the 
first five months of the year fell 31 percent in june the biggest 
drop in three years food prices fell 08 percent the steepest in a 
year and a half reversing an identical increase in may 
the labor department offered these details of prices in june 
tomato and celery costs which had doubled in may because of 
unseasonably cool weather in california fell sharply vegetables 
overall fell 8 percent last month following a 264 percent rise in 
may 
other food catagories posting declines were pasta 9 percent 
fish 73 percent chickens 52 percent and beef and veal 38 
percent 
prices rose for pork turkey fresh fruit eggs and candy 
the energy decline included drops of 8 percent for fuel oil 4 
percent for gasoline and 2 percent for natural gas 
tobacco prices rose 58 percent 
prices for prescription and overthecounter drugs soaps and 
furniture also rose while prices for flatware womens clothing 
jewelry glassware and cosmetics declined 
the overall june decline left the producer price index for 
finished goods one stop short of retail at 1141 meaning that a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 
11410 last month 10 cents less than in may but 640 more than a 
year ago 
the news from inflation measures earlier in the production 
process was also good the price of intermediate goods fell 02 
percent in june after rising only 01 percent in may while crude 
goods dropped 20 percent following a 09 percent rise an example 
of the three processing stages would be finished bread 
intermediate flour and crude wheat

paris ap japans embattled prime minister a parttime poet 
spoke lyrically of brotherly love and the future in explaining his 
vision of the paris summit but beneath sousuke unos soft words was 
his determination to overcome sex and money scandals and maintain 
his partys threedecade hold on power 
the 66yearold uno who took office only a month ago after the 
downfall of his predecessor noboru takeshita heralded his arrival 
in paris for the 15th annual economic summit with lavish promises of 
aid for poorer nations and the environment 
to promote his plan uno quickly threw himself into a series of 
bilateral meetings with leaders of countries both rich and poor 
ranging from the united states and great britain to bangladesh and 
mexico 
president bush gave him a personal boost friday by suggesting 
they treat each other on a firstname basis saying close personal 
relations were important for their countries ties japanese 
officials said 
thank you george uno said as he left a short bilateral 
meeting 
at the meeting the two leaders agreed to launch talks on 
removing trade barriers the move gives bush the opportunity to 
press japan to open its markets further to us goods while 
satisfying japan in removing such talks from the threat of 
retaliation posed by the us trade bill 
japanese officials have spoken confidently here of the 
strengthened role their nation will take in future meetings 
while japan has been criticized for its excessive trade 
surpluses chief government spokesman taizo watanabe said officials 
are now determined to be an active member of the summit and try to 
contribute as much as possible to the welfare and future growth and 
burdensharing of the next seven years 
the aid proposals are signs of determination on the part of 
japan and uno himself to try to contribute to the constructive 
discussion of the summit meetings 
watanabe said that enroute to paris uno the author of three 
books of haiku poetry told his spokesman he sees the summit as a 
forum for love for humanity through fighting terrorism and drugs 
light for the future through economic growth and burdensharing by 
helping nations in debt 
still uno and his liberal democratic party which has governed 
japan since 1955 may be too deeply mired in problems at home to win 
total forgiveness from voters through deft summit work 
political analysts were predicting unos party would lose its 
majority in the upper house of the diet parliament in elections on 
july 23 in the wake of an unpopular sales tax a widespread 
influencepeddling scandal and allegations uno kept paid mistresses 
including a geisha 
the allegations about uno became widespread soon after he took 
over last month from takeshita who resigned as prime minister after 
accepting responsibility for an influencepeddling scandal that 
brought down three members of his cabinet 
uncharacteristically for japan where political wives are nearly 
anonymous photos of mrs uno and the uno family were featured 
prominently in a press packet prepared for foreign reporters 
covering the summit 
at the summit uno will pledge nearly 40 billion in new aid 
funds including a 35 billion extension of japans program which 
had been scheduled to end this year to recycle its trade surpluses 
for the benefit of developing countries 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney who met with uno on 
thursday was very impressed with the aid figures officials 
said 
canadas finance minister michael wilson welcomed the debt 
relief which will be one of the discussion topics between the seven 
summiteers 
japan is in the position to take the lead role here he told 
reporters they are in the strongest position from the 
balanceofpayments standpoint 
japan also announced it will set aside 225 billion for projects 
to preserve the global environment an area where it has recently 
been trying to change its longtime image as an abuser of resources

three former housing and urban development 
officials are trying to raise money for the legal expenses of 
another former agency official who is accused of steering hud money 
to a developer in exchange for a bribe 
a letter bearing the names of the three former officials seeking 
100 donations to the dr james e baugh legal defense fund 
says baugh has been victimized by the same machinery that has 
targeted other leaders nationwide 
that is an apparent reference to investigations stemming from 
allegations of fraud mismanagement and influence peddling at hud 
the three former hud officials are maurice barksdale lance 
wilson and al moran 
baugh former hud assistant secretary for public and indian 
housing and urban development was indicted in may accused of 
steering a 400000 hud contract to a washington developer john b 
clyburn in return the indictment alleged clyburn promised to 
increase the salary of baughs wife who worked for a company 
clyburn owned the indictment said clyburn who has close ties to 
washington mayor marion barry also helped baughs wife obtain a 
45000 city contract 
baugh and clyburn pleaded innocent and were released pending 
trial 
baugh was hired as a housing official by dade county fla 
shortly after he left hud and a separate investigation is under way 
to determine whether there was any connection between that 
appointment and 28 million in hud contracts dade county received in 
the six preceding months he was suspended from the florida job 
after being indicted in washington 
as for the three men trying to raise money for him 
wilson former top aide to reagan administration hud secretary 
samuel pierce has been shown to be the owner or developer of six 
projects that received hud rehabilitation funds after he left the 
agency 
moran who served as assistant secretary for community planning 
and development under pierce was involved in approval of a north 
carolina project being pushed by a longtime pierce friend moran 
left the government and joined a law firm that was involved in the 
development 
barksdale now works in housing management for a company based in 
texas and according to hud officials is involved in a number of 
hud projects 
barksdale and wilson are listed on the letter as two of the five 
cochairs of the fund moran is listed as its treasurer donors are 
asked to send donations to a chicago bank 
we must pay more than lip service to this affront the letter 
says in requesting 100 donations which it says are being solicited 
in hopes of raising 100000 one hundred dollars to assist a 
friend who has stood by us in our time of need is a small 
contribution when compared with the large contribution he had on 
making our programs successful 
a copy of the letter obtained by the associated press was sent to 
a housing official in california 
among the subjects of congressional and fbi investigations are 
allegations of influence peddling at hud by former agency officials 
and prominent republicans who served as consultants for developers 
of hud projects 
the letter said baugh played a catalytic role in the success 
of public housing during his seven years at hud it praised him for 
among other things returning our calls and responding with quick 
answers empowering his staff to assist us when help was 
needed and testifying on our behalf at congressional committee 
hearings 
attempts to reach baugh for comment friday were unsuccessful a 
man answering the telephone at his reston va home said baugh was 
not there his attorney did not immediately return telephone 
messages

both the factory operating rate and industrial 
production fell last month the government said friday providing 
more evidence of a slowing economy caused by antiinflation measures 
the federal reserve said the june operating rate declined to 835 
percent a 03 percentage point drop from may the rate was 841 
percent in april and hit a 10year high of 843 percent in december 
the fed also said industrial production was off 02 percent last 
month with its industrial production index standing at 1411 
percent of its 1977 base down from mays 1414 percent it was the 
first decline since it fell 02 percent in february which had been 
the first drop in a year 
its really related to the consumer pulling back on autos and 
other durable goods that go with housing said economist david 
jones of aubrey g lanston amp co in new york it was that high 
interest rate environment that was really the major source of the 
weakness 
until recently the fed has been pushing up interest rates in an 
attempt to cool inflationary pressures without slowing economic 
growth so much that the economy slides into a recession 
jerry jasinowski chief economist for the national association of 
manufacturers said fridays reports are not indications of an 
emerging slide into recession 
rather they should be viewed as the temporary softenss that is 
likely to be associated with a softlanding scenario for the 
economy he said 
analysts also saw the decline in the factory operating rate as 
further lessening of inflationary pressures the closer that 
industry gets to full operating capacity the greater difficulty it 
has producing enough to meet demand leading to shortages and price 
increases 
the decline in capacity utilization which reflects increased 
capital investment as well as slower output growth provides 
additional confirmation that contrary to previous fears the economy 
is not in danger of capacity shortages jasinowski said 
robert g dederick of northern trust co in chicago said 
operating rates for iron steel paper and industrial chemicals are 
down 
these are the industries that were so strong earlier and where 
a lot of the inflation was occurring he said 
the manufacturing plant operating rate fell 03 percentage point 
to 838 percent down from mays 841 percent prior to april the 
rate had declined since it peaked at 847 percent in january 
the rate at factories producing durable goods bigticket items 
expected to last more than three years fell 03 percentage point 
from 827 percent in may this reflected in large part a reduction 
in the production of cars 
the rate at factories producing nondurable goods dropped to 858 
percent compared with mays 860 percent 
production remained flat at manufacturing plants making both 
durable and nondurable goods 
output at mines and oil wells fell 11 percent after a revised 
03 percent decline in may production at utilities dropped 13 
percent in june after a 02 percent drop in may 
jasinowski said output of energy materials should increase when 
coal strikes are settled more than 30000 coal miners have been on 
strike for over a month in appalachia and the midwest 
jasinowski also said warmer weather demands for electric power 
would result in increased utility production this summer 
last months factory operating rate was up from 83 percent a year 
earlier the industrial production index was 34 percent higher than 
a year ago

enough is enough foy said in damanding a new package 
each year each state lawmaker gets 5000 25cent stamps to sent 
letters out to the voters but foy says the commemorative stamps 
that happen to commemorate some other state make him look silly

soviet lawmakers voted overwhelmingly friday to let 
the kgb chief keep his job but they told him to stop spying on 
ordinary citizens and laughed in disbelief when he insisted the 
agency doesnt tap telephones 
it was the first time a kgb chief had stood up in public to 
justify the actions of the secretive intelligence agency which is 
blamed for killing millions during josef stalins rule 
political reforms gave the supreme soviet the power to reject 
cabinetlevel appointees and the official tass news agency quoted 
kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov as saying thursdays questioning was 
the most difficult examination of his life 
but in the end only six of the 542 deputies in the supreme 
soviet voted against his confirmation twentysix deputies abstained 
kryuchkov has been kgb chairman since last year and was deputy 
chairman for 10 years before that 
deputies submitted written questions and kryuchkov read them 
himself reducing the stinging tone 
by what right do you tap peoples telephones asked one 
legislator 
derisive snorts of laughter greeted kryuchkovs answer that the 
kgb does not bug telephones of soviet citizens maverick communist 
boris yeltsin told western reporters during a break he did not 
believe it 
kryuchkov said the kgb which performs both domestic and foreign 
security functions strictly follows soviet laws and has only a 
few helpers who inform on neighbors and colleagues he said 30 
western spies have been captured in the last three years 
yeltsin said in a speech later that there were agents in every 
soviet institution doing great moral damage with their snooping 
but he said that during the 10 years he was communist party chief in 
the city of sverdlovsk the agents never caught a single spy 
marju lauristin a professor and reform leader from estonia told 
deputies that many students have told her they were offered money 
within the past year to inform on other students and teachers 
the balding spectacled kryuchkov responded to questions at 
rapidfire speed but provided few real answers 
he refused to reveal the kgbs budget despite repeated inquiries 
but said it would be published soon 
he also refused to say how many employees the kgb has but he 
said its border guard contingent alone numbers 200000 
kryuchkov also said the kgb does not maintain dossiers on any 
dissidents except those who present a threat to the state 
he did disclose that he was personally involved in starting the 
controversial investigation of a pair of popular prosecutors who 
claim they ran into trouble when their investigation of corruption 
reached into the ruling politburo 
kryuchkov said he thought of the prosecutors telman gdlyan and 
nikolai ivanov as legends when he became kgb chairman but that 
within a week his staff suggested they were guilty of coercing 
confessions kryuchkov said he alerted the chief prosecutor and they 
found substance to the allegations 
kryuchkov also admitted the kgb should have done a better job 
dealing with recent ethnic rioting in the republic of uzbekistan 
where about 100 people died he held out the possibility the kgb 
could join interpol the international police network in the west 
president mikhail s gorbachev chaired the session and tried to 
cut off debate several times but the deputies refused gorbachev 
joined the discussion only once to agree that the new kgb building 
in the city of ufa was too grandiose gorbachev said that when he 
saw the imposing edifice he suggested the local kgb move back to 
its old quarters 
kryuchkov later said that secrecy must exist 
if we tell everything about what we are doing then we will 
probably weaken ourselves and strengthen those whom we must 
unfortunately from time to time try to counter he told the 
evening tv news program vremya 
i think in this matter my colleagues from the united states 
and other countries probably agree with me he said

anniversary of the storming of the bastille the july 14 1789 
takeover of the prison and symbol of oppression under louis xvi 
galvanized a spirit of freedom and marked the start of the french 
revolution 
that doesnt get much notice in paris ind however where 
questions about what was being done to mark the occasion drew blank 
stares by noon friday not even a television camera had showed up 
to mark the day 
it was much the same story for parisians in arkansas idaho and 
illinois who also largely shrugged off the holiday 
do what bastille day not that i know of said city clerk 
bill rhineheart in paris ark 
its too bad we dont have a celebration for the bastille 
day said tim toland the mayor of paris idaho which as it 
happens is named for a fellow named perris but were a mormon 
community and this year is the 100th anniversary of our tabernacle 
a bit more was planned in paris texas which became slightly 
famous when an arty movie was made with that name some years back 
they planned a community spaghetti dinner and a production of 
macbeth friday night as well as a frenchstyle bicycle race on 
saturday 
why shakespeare and spaghetti spaghetti because its full of 
carbohydrates for the bicyclists and macbeth because the 
community theater season happened to include that play for july 14 
said mal watson an organizer of the weekends events 
paris ind with a population of 25 or 30 is about 40 miles 
southwest of versailles pronounced versayles it was once a 
thriving community but now is just a clump of houses overshadowed by 
its neighbor to the west paris crossing or as it is known 
locally new paris 
how did paris ind get its name if anyone would know it 
probably would be ethel deputy 92 a former schoolteacher who lives 
with her sister cora dodd 98 a few doors down from the store 
i asked my mother the same thing and she was 87 when i asked 
her and she couldnt tell miss deputy said but her family 
came from paris kentucky 
no one in paris can speak french residents say nor can any 
recall anyone ever visiting their european namesake but a few years 
ago a group of french parisians came to the jennings county town 
some time back they came some fellows from france and they 
was visiting all the places named paris taking pictures and getting 
some history feltner said 
paris has a proud history back in the 20s the 1820s it 
received the votes of two delegates in the election to choose a new 
state capital indianapolis won its tailors were famous for their 
suits and men that wore them turned heads when they ventured into 
nearby madison people would say theres a man with a suit from 
paris feltner says 
but paris fate was sealed when it was bypassed by the railroad 
now from feltners front yard you can see only about a dozen homes 
and as many outbuildings across the street is an empty lot with 
lawn ornaments 
there was a grocery store here where that deer is and it 
caught fire feltner said now if you want groceries the nearest 
place to buy them is assmanns store a little ways down the highway 
in new paris where about 200 people reside 
assmann said he knew of no ceremonies that would mark bastille 
day in the community 
but dont let that fool you he said these quiet towns 
they can get rattled up

in the fringes of paris summitry britain and france 
are playing out old rivalries sniping about everything from the 
significance of the french revolution to british prime minister 
margaret thatchers rightwing policies 
amid the greetings the banquets and the parades marking the 
celebration of the revolutions 200th anniversary and the start of 
the summit of the seven major industrialized democracies the 
britishfrench exchanges are becoming increasingly less fraternal 
mrs thatcher began the latest spat telling frances le monde 
newspaper that the overthrow of the french monarchy did not initiate 
the concept of human rights britain with the 1215 magna carta and 
america with the 1776 declaration of independence did that long 
before and without a bloody reign of terror 
michel rocard frances socialist premier came back sharply 
friday saying in an interview here with british television that 
while he admired britains democratic traditions the conservative 
mrs thatchers policies were heading toward social cruelty 
i am and mrs thatcher is well aware of the fact concerned 
about the british governments trend toward social cruelty which i 
fear may damage the relationship between britains different social 
classes and regions and in time possibly even the very quality of 
britains political democracy said rocard 
as news of his interview broke here a british spokesman produced 
figures contrasting the britains unemployment rate of 63 percent 
down from 102 percent in 1987 with frances 10 percent scarcely 
changed from two years ago 
theyve really made very little progress since 1987 said the 
british spokesman requesting anonymity 
asked how mrs thatcher felt about rocards remarks he added 
coolly im not even sure she is aware of them 
before arriving thursday mrs thatcher told le monde that 
through britains history parliament imposed its will on the 
monarchy which continues to flourish in britain 
mrs thatcher is also putting a damper on french president 
francois mitterrands attempts to turn the paris summit into a 
dialogue between the rich countries and some 30 third world heads of 
government he invited to the bicentennial celebration 
mitterrand responded warmly to a call by four third world 
countries for a northsouth conference on ways to help debtor 
countries handle crippling burdens 
british officials immediately told reporters that mrs thatcher 
saw no need for such a conference or any new initiative and that 
commercial banks and debtor nations should get on and settle the 
problems under initiatives already agreed to 
asked about the atmosphere between mitterrand and thatcher who 
clashed last month about european monetary union at a european 
economic community summit the british spokesman replied simply 
very good 
when mrs thatcher arrived for the start of the bicentennial 
celebration she was greeted by boos mingled with applause from 
the watching crowd of parisians 
british officials shrugged this off sounds just like home 
quipped one 
but britains opposition socialist labor party now well ahead of 
mrs thatchers party in the polls accused her of making an 
eccentric spectacle of herself with her offensive comments 
about the french revolution 
in a statement in london labors foreign affairs spokesman 
gerald kaufman said he wondered if she has gone mad 
such conduct is of course extremely offensive to the french 
people who are taking part in an historic national celebration 
kaufman 
it is even more worrying for the british people who now 
watch with incredulity as the british prime minister makes an 
eccentric spectacle of herself in front of the world added 
kaufman 
i can only conclude that mrs tahtcher sees herself as a 20th 
century marie antoinette who faced with the justified complaint of 
the electorate she misrule airily replies let them eat pate

an alabama prison official said friday that 
although it took two tries to execute a convicted killer in the 
electric chair the first jolt of electricity rendered him 
unconscious 
the botched execution of horace franklin dunkins jr with the 
first failed try apparently caused by a faulty cable hookup is 
likely to refuel arguments by death penalty opponents that the 
electric chair is cruel and unusual punishment a 1983 execution 
that took three jolts of electricity led to a federal court 
challenge 
dunkins attorney called the drawnout electrocution a grisly 
scene 
the state prison commissioner called it human error 
dunkins 28 a mildly retarded man was executed for the 1980 
slaying of a woman who was raped and stabbed 66 times while tied to 
a tree 
the first throw of the switch at 1208 am brought no response 
from the 5foot11 man whose face was covered by a black veil 
attached to the electrodes on his head two doctors who examined 
dunkins determined he was unconscious but had a strong heartbeat 
prison commissioner morris thigpen said at a news conference later 
a guard in the witness room opened the door to the death chamber 
and told another guard directing the execution i believe youve 
got the jacks on wrong 
theyre torturing him dunkins attorney death penalty 
opponent steve ellis said softly to a fellow witness 
officials fixed the problem and threw the switch again at 1217 
am delivering 2100 volts to dunkins he was declared dead 10 
minutes later 
i regret very very much what happened thigpen said it 
was human error i just hope he was not conscious and did not 
suffer 
holman warden charles jones said later friday that electrical 
current did reach dunkins body on the first surge it rendered him 
unconscious said jones 
of the faulty connection he said through our procedures of 
checking the equipment each day somehow someway it got reversed 
and we are right now correcting the problem 
officials said they didnt know how much voltage was in the first 
charge 
alabama law allows application of electricity to the condemned 
until the prisoner is dead 
in 1983 three jolts of 1900 volts were required to kill 
murderer john louis evans iii prompting criticism from death 
penalty foes that evans was burned alive officials said two 
extra jolts were required because an electrode came off evans leg 
in the first charge 
the incident led to a federal court challenge but the courts 
ruled the use of the chair was constitutional 
dunkins was convicted of capital murder in 1981 in the rape and 
slaying of lynn mccurry 26 of warrior a mother of four children 
who were asleep in the house as she was assaulted and killed 
outside her husband allen found her body tied to the tree when he 
returned home from work 
ellis described dunkins 19 at the time of the crime as an 
illiterate when the killing occurred but who taught himself to read 
and write during his eight years on death row 
allen mccurry said dunkins deserved execution its taken so 
long it ought to be over 
the us supreme court refused thursday to block the execution 
dunkins became the 115th person executed in the united states and 
the fifth in alabama since the supreme court allowed states to 
reinstate capital punishment in 1976

a senior agriculture department scientist said 
friday the possibility of global warming from the socalled 
greenhouse effect is too much of a risk to ignore 
assistant secretary charles e hess who oversees science and 
education programs said he has named gary r evans as his special 
assistant for global change issues evans has been deputy 
administrator of the departments agricultural research service 
there are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought was 
evidence that global warming has already begun hess said a 
conclusive link has not been proven but the threat of global 
warming from heat trapped by socalled greenhouse gases is too much 
of a risk to ignore 
gases include carbon dioxide chlorofluorocarbons methane 
nitrogen oxides and halons he said in a statement some of the 
gases also seem to be causing a thinning of the highlevel ozone 
layer which filters out a large part of the ultraviolet rays which 
can limite the growth of sensitive crops 
evans will coordinate activities among seven usda agencies and 
the landgrant universities as part of the departments efforts to 
protect crops and forests hess said 
department studies some dating back to the 1950s have shown 
substantial damage to crops and forests from atmospheric 
pollutants including lowlevel ozone he said 
evans and other usda scientists represent the department on the 
intergovernmental panel for climate change which was formed last 
november in geneva switzerland by the united nations environmental 
program and the world meteorological organization

an american rabbi and six students today 
occupied a roman catholic monastery on the edge of auschwitz to 
demand its nuns leave but men working at the convent beat the 
protesters and dragged them out 
about 20 people including uniformed and plainclothes police 
watched as the workers came out of the convent and asaulted the 
protesters who called the convent a desecration of the jews 
killed at the nazi concentration camp 
rabbi avraham weiss of the hebrew institute of new york said his 
group suffered bruises scrapes bleeding noses and lips their 
signs were destroyed their clothes were torn and they were forced 
to leave the convent grounds 
weiss said that the nuns watched from the window of the convent 
and did not move to stop the workers 
its extraordinary that 50 years later something like this 
could happen said weiss i demand an apology from these nuns 
the incident occurred five hours after the protesters climbed a 
sevenfoot wroughtiron fence and occupied the monastery the 
facility is located in a former nazi warehouse on the perimeter of 
the camp where 4 million people died from 1940 to 1945 an estimated 
25 million of them jews 
when he occupied the monastery weiss said the group would stay 
until the end of the sabbath saturday night 
it was the second time the workers confronted weiss and the 
students 
earlier today workers on the second floor of the convent doused 
the protesters with water jeered and told the men to leave 
the workers began manhandling the protesters and trying to expel 
them but the workers returned to the convent when police officers 
outside the convent gate shouted at them to stop 
it was not clear why the police did nothing the second time the 
workers attacked the protesters who wore yarmulkes draped prayer 
shawls over their shoulders and held lighted candles 
how dare you throw water at a rabbi or any jew here at 
auschwitz shame shame shame on you weiss shouted at the 
workers 
he spoke english but the workers and nuns spoke only polish 
i saw when they workers came to us i saw the vengeance in 
their eyes we want our dead respected weiss said 
the protest brought out strong emotions of hurt anger and hatred 
among several dozen poles who passed by the convent during the day 
and began to argue with the group 
this is our poland what are you doing here one middleaged 
woman said to the group 
they the group should think about palestinian arabs said 
another man piotr wron its a kind of rape because the sisters 
are innocent 
weiss tried to talk to the passersby but he couldnt speak their 
language 
the cloister was founded in 1984 in a former nazi storehouse on 
the perimeter of the former death camp the lawn with a 23foot 
wooden cross in the middle is a former gravel pit where political 
prisoners were gunned down by nazi executioners in 1940 and 1941 
a 1987 geneva declaration signed by 18 roman catholic and jewish 
leaders called for the transfer of the 14 barefoot carmelite nuns 
to an interfaith prayer and education center to be built at an 
undetermined site farther from the camp 
the international controversy surrounding the convent has become 
even more emotional since the deadline for moving the nuns passed 
feb 22 
in may 300 women from 27 countries held a peaceful protest in 
front of the convent 
dont darken the memory this convent is a desecration of the 6 
million said a sign held by todays protesters referring to the 
estimated 6 million jews killed in the holocaust 
weiss said his group is demanding the convent be removed the 
cross dismantled and the nuns leave cardinal macharski is 
responsible for arranging the transfer of the convent 
weiss said that despite the church promise to move the convent by 
february it appeared the nuns were refurbishing the building and 
grounds 
our patience has run out said weiss whose hebrew institute 
is in riverdale in the bronx 
were here to stay said glenn richter one of weiss 
students

texas tycoon nelson bunker hunt who with 
brother william herbert hunt is fighting irs claims that they owe 1 
billion in taxes and interest won a partial victory in one of the 
cases friday 
the tax court sided with bunker hunt and his wife caroline on a 
key issue in a case involving millions of dollars worth of transfers 
they made to cover their childrens losses on investments in silver 
the court held that transfers of money made through march 14 
1980 when silver prices were still rising were loans that the 
hunts could write off as bad debts after the children were unable to 
repay them payments to the children after that date were gifts on 
which the hunts must pay taxes judge carolyn m parr ruled 
the judge held that the hunts children to the extent they had 
any net worth remaining at the end of 1980 are liable for income 
taxes on the value of their forgiven debts to the parents 
in addition to the hunts the case involved son houston hunt 
daughters mary huddleston and elizabeth curnes and sonsinlaw 
albert d huddleston and thomas j curnes 
the internal revenue service was seeking more than 175 million 
in 1980 income tax and gift tax in the cases the bulk of it from 
the elder hunts the court decision did not indicate how much the 
brothers and their children would owe as a result of the ruling 
im not really as familiar with it as id like to be so i cant 
comment on it bunker hunt said when asked about the ruling 
the trial of a separate case involving 1982 taxes and penalties 
sought from bunker and william herbert hunt is continuing in tax 
court the central issue is a partnership and the value of assets 
that the hunts used to cover their debts when the silver market 
plunged 
a hunt cousin testified friday that a preciousmetals dealer 
threatened to make the entire hunt family suffer unless bunker and 
william herbert repaid 434 million in debt from the march 27 1980 
silver price collapse 
cousin tom hunt told of a meeting with milton rosenthal then 
chairman and president of new jerseybased engelhard corp three 
days after the price plunge 
mr rosenthal said the three individuals must pay or the rest 
of the family must suffer tom hunt told judge jules g korner iii 
in a nonjury trial in which bunker and herbert are contesting about 
300 million in 1982 taxes while brother lamar is contesting 
500000 
tom hunt said that lamar youngest of the three brothers did not 
owe engelhard 
he said he told rosenthal that the brothers would be ready to go 
into bankruptcy to protect the familys other assetsonce he said 
the family must suffer i took it to mean every hunt company 
every hunt every individual had to share in payment hunt said 
i felt it was a threat 
according to bunker and herberts attorney michael henke 
engelhard officials and the brothers met with a group of bankers in 
an unsuccessful effort to get a loan bunker and herbert ultimately 
settled their engelhard debt with silver and a 20 percent interest 
in their beaufort sea oil and gas interests 
to settle remaining silver debts the familyowned placid oil co 
borrowed 11 billion and put 824 million of it into a partnership 
with the brothers they added gold stocks and silver and coal 
properties which the government contends are worth far less that 
the hunts estimates 
the case decided by the court friday indicated the net worth of 
the hunt children was tied directly to the price of silver in which 
they with money from their parents had heavily invested 
at the end of 1979 the combined net worth of the three children 
a fourth was not involved in the case and two spouses was 76 
million in less than a month at the silver peak they were worth a 
combined 163 million they were wiped out in the price collapse 
chiefly because their investment was in contracts for future 
purchases whose price fluctuations were limited 
in the first five months of 1980 bunker and caroline hunt 
transferred more than 150 million to the children to help them make 
margin calls in the silver market or to take delivery of silver 
late in 1980 bunker hunt formally demanded that the children 
turn over all their assets except their homes to settle the debts 
he wrote off as taxdeductible bad debt the portion of the loans 
exceeding the childrens assets

janos kadar who led the communist party 
for 32 years until losing power to a new generation of reformers 
was buried friday and praised as an early advocate of change 
thousands of people attended the somber state ceremony which 
culminated two days of emotional tribute to the 77yearold leader 
who died july 6 14 months after his ouster 
his great merit was to become a reformer in an age of 
rigidity said president bruno f straub referring to kadars 
cautious support of economic reforms in the late 1960s and early 
1970s 
party chairman rezsoe nyers the architect of pioneering economic 
reforms in the late 1960s said kadars name has become 
inseparable from the hungarian cause and international progress 
neither speaker alluded to the criticism of kadar that followed 
his ouster as party leader in may 1988 
thousands of hungarians lined the streets as the black mercedes 
hearst carrying kadars body slowly made its way from the central 
committee building in downtown budapest to kerepesi cemetery where 
toplevel communist officials are traditionally interred 
kadars rule began amid the bloodshed of the 1956 antistalinist 
revolt as soviet troops and tanks entered budapest to quell the 
uprising it ended 32 years later when party leaders increasingly 
viewed him as an obstacle to change 
kadars body lay in state for two days in the gallery of the 
partys central committee building and officials said more than 
60000 people had come to pay their respects 
these people were not just saying goodbye deputy party 
spokesman emil kimmel said they came to express their thanks for 
the last 30 years 
karoly grosz who replaced kadar as party general secretary in 
the changes that swept reformers into top party ranks said kadars 
death closed a major era of our history 
we pay our respects in a worthwhile manner if we sincerely and 
objectively face the lessons of the age marked by his name 
grosz said in a eulogy at central committee headquarters 
hungarian tv carried live coverage of the funeral 
kadar was stigmatized for helping the soviets crush the 1956 
revolt and blamed for economic stagnation after his cautious reforms 
stalled in the 1970s but many hungarians credit him with guiding 
hungary to relative prosperity 
my parents always taught me that until 1975 they had a good 
life and that it was due to kadar attila bauer 27 was quoted as 
saying in the hungarian daily magyar hirlap 
a man in his early 30s told hungarian tv i know that he led 
the country to a catastrophic situation but im convinced that he 
always had the best of intentions 
kadar gained respect at home and abroad for his cautious economic 
reforms and policy of relative tolerance of dissent 
but as the reforms stalled and the nations foreign debt mounted 
kadar became increasingly at odds with younger reformers pressing 
for bolder change 
kadar was named honorary party chairman after he lost the top 
party post to grosz but one year later he was removed from that 
post he also was stripped of his membership in the policysetting 
central committee which criticized him for mistakes during his rule 
it was under kadars rule that the 1956 uprising was officially 
dubbed a counterrevolution and its leader imre nagy was executed 
the communist party recently reevaluated the uprising as a 
popular revolt and nagy was rehabilitated his remains were 
reburied in an elaborate ceremony june 16 that was attended by 
hundreds of thousands of hungarians 
only hours after kadars death the hungarian supreme court 
declared nagy innocent of all charges

the senate intelligence committee on friday 
sharply criticized the fbi for investigating american groups opposed 
to us policies in central america saying the agency should purge 
its files 
the panel said in an 150page report that the fbis 198385 probe 
of the committee in solidarity with the people of el salvador 
cispes and other groups was based on allegations that should not 
have been considered credible 
the cispes files contain information about domestic political 
activities that the fbi should never have gathered said senate 
intelligence committee chairman david boren dokla and vice 
chairman sen william cohen rmaine 
that information must be removed from fbi records so it cannot 
be used to damage the reputation of innocent persons they said 
a classaction lawsuit seeking the removal of the files is 
pending in federal court in the district of columbia 
boren and cohen said there was no evidence the white house tried 
to influence the probe which eventually involved all 59 fbi offices 
and included spinoff investigations of 2370 people and 1330 
groups in the united states 
hugh byrne political director of cispes called the 
investigation politically motivated 
the reagan administration wanted to stifle domestic opposition 
to its policies in central america particularly the unjust wars in 
el salvador and nicaragua he said 
byrne however applauded the senate call for the fbi to remove 
the case records from its files 
fbi director william sessions told the intelligence committee on 
sept 19 that his internal probe of the agency revealed a lack of 
managerial controls in the case 
fbi officials had no immediate comment but the report said that 
sessions had disciplined six employees the report which didnt say 
what disciplinary action was taken said sessions had identified 
most of the problems that contributed to the mistakes made in the 
case 
william webster director of the cia was head of the fbi when 
the investigation began in june 1981 when salvadoran expatriate 
frank varelli infiltrated the dallas office of the solidarity 
committee 
the report labeled varelli the son of a former salvadoran 
interior minister and national police chief as an unreliable source 
the spinoff investigations according to the report raise 
questions about the lengths the government should go in probing 
political organizations and should be considered in revisions of 
fbi and justice department policies 
the report has been sent to the senate judiciary committee 
the solidarity committees contention that the investigation was 
politically motivated is bolstered by a 1983 memorandum from the 
fbis new orleans office the memo was included in the report 
it is imperative at this time to formulate some plan of attack 
against cispes and specifically against individuals who 
defiantly display their contempt for the us government by making 
speeches and propagandizing their cause while asking for political 
asylum the memo said in part 
the memorandum surfaced during a freedom of information inquiry 
by the center for constitutional rights a new york citybased 
nonprofit legal office which filed the classaction lawsuit 
the united states has supplied more than 3 billion in aid to the 
salvadoran government since 1981 about 300 million in us aid has 
gone to the contras who have been at war with the nicaraguan 
government

the british library is the nations repository of 
printed books collected for more than 300 years but it now is 
wrestling with a revolutionary idea being choosy 
we have 16 million books and we are chockablock says kenneth 
cooper the chief executive 
so many new books are appearing that we no longer have the 
space to keep every one the problem is what do we throw out he 
said in an interview friday 
librarians everywhere face it and what is considered of no 
importance now will be just whats wanted in the next century 
in the 19th century the british museum the foundation of the 
british library threw away the advertisements at the back of the 
weekly serial parts of charles dickens novels before binding them 
now social historians study the ads and the complete weekly 
parts are more valuable than first editions of the novels 
its an awful dilemma when you think what future generations 
will say about us and i feel nobody is going to be satisfied 
said joyce butcher an american in charge of acquisitions 
processing and cataloguing at the british library 
time and circumstances change the point of view if we had been 
around in the 16th century we might not have kept william 
shakespeares plays because he was outside the academic 
establishment said ms butcher who grew up in jenison mich 
the british library is one of the greatest in the world formed 
in 1973 from books in the british museum its treasures range from 
the lindisfarne gospels written by a monk about 698 to original 
scores of the beatles pop group in the 1960s 
a 65 million library is being constructed and will open in 1993 
next to st pancras train station 
if we move to st pancras all the books in the museum and 17 
other buildings in london where we store our books we would be full 
up right away so we must do something now cooper said 
the library commissioned a report on the problem from its own and 
outside experts who found no alternative to becoming more selective 
their report pointed out a loophole in the 1911 copyright act which 
had been an asset but now is a burden 
in that year the british museum acquired all the books which 
from the year 1600 publishers had to deposit with the stationers 
livery guild the 1911 act required publishers to do the same for 
five other copyright libraries in oxford cambridge wales 
scotland and trinity college dublin which was part of the british 
empire in 1911 
the report said the british library is bound under the law to 
receive all books but not to keep them 
we cannot anyway cooper said 
we have 300 miles of crowded shelves and we need 8 miles of 
shelving on which to put each years new books last year there 
were 300000 british publications 62000 books as well as 
newspapers pamphlets and even local railway timetables and 
leaflets he said 
cooper said first solutions may include sharing with the other 
copyright libraries so they hold different books 
we may keep only one title by authors of myriad romantic and 
western novels refuse reprints if there are no textual changes from 
original editions reject obscure works written on word processors 
for limited circulation store rarely requested material outside 
london and dispose of duplicates he said 
we have the same problem too said nancy bush information 
officer at the library of congress in washington 
we thought we were in good shape when we moved into the largest 
library building in the world in 1981 but we will be out of space in 
1992 we are discussing all sorts of solutions giving some 
attention to priority and looking for space for 3 million books and 
serials in secondary storage she said 
ms bush said the library of congress has 550 miles of shelves 
and receives 31000 items a day of which it keeps 7000 
there are 146 million books among the 88350534 items in the 
library 
goodness knows who counted them ms bush said

bathing in the slimecovered waters along italys 
adriatic coast poses no health risk but it is probably best not to 
swim in the algae government health experts said friday 
the sea is dirty but it is not dangerous said professor 
alessandro beretta anguissola president of the superior health 
council 
the floating algae appeared along the coast last week and hotel 
operators in the friuli veneto emilia romagna and marche regions 
say tourists are canceling reservations 
anguissola said tests confirmed the algae wasnt toxic and there 
was no need to ban swimming but later in the day the council 
released a document recommending against swimming in algae for 
reasons of prudence and hygiene 
anguissola reiterated the governments earlier warning against 
swimming in the algae for those with open wounds or cuts 
he said the algae has flourished in warm still water when it 
rots tiny gas bubbles carry the slime to the surface 
the federation of italian hotel and tour operators predicted that 
tourist losses this summer due to the algae could total nearly 200 
million

south africas government has made notable 
shifts in policy recently particularly concerning imprisoned black 
leader nelson mandela the african national congress said friday 
thabo mbeki foreign affairs secretary for the guerrilla 
organization said the anc would not oppose a negotiated solution to 
end race segregation in south africa but that it does not believe 
the government is committed to peace talks 
nothing really of any seriousness has been said or done to 
convince us that the other side has in fact opted for a political 
solution of this matter mbeki said at the outlawed organizations 
headquarters in lusaka 
he said fw de klerk designated to succeed south african 
president pw botha has not addressed the main conditions the anc 
has stipulated for opening talks 
the release of mandela and all other political prisoners 
the legalization of the anc and other outlawed organizations 
ending the state of emergency 
withdrawing south african soldiers from black townships and 
the return of exiles 
mbeki made no comment on a july 5 meeting between mandela and 
botha who is to retire in september the anc has said the meeting 
had no meaning but has been silent since mandela issued a statement 
saying he and botha discussed peaceful development for south africa 
mbeki said there were notable shifts in south african policy he 
noted the government no longer requires that mandela formally 
renounce violence before it will consider freeing him from his life 
prison term 
to that extent one could talk about new thinking said 
mbeki whose father govan was convicted with mandela in 1964 for 
sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government the elder 
mbeki was released from his life term in 1987 but is banned from 
speaking in public talking to the press or leaving his hometown 
without police permission 
mbeki acknowledged his organizations insistence on the five 
preconditions was not new thinking 
it is though a readiness on the part of the anc to find such 
a political solution if the conditions are there 
otherwise he said we need to continue the struggle escalate 
the pressures 
mbeki was due to meet saturday with a delegation from the 
antiapartheid democratic party which is fighting its first south 
african election campaign in september south africas 28 million 
black majority has no vote in national politics which are dominated 
by the 5 million white minority

president bush has decided against sending a us 
delegation to israel to make sure that prime minister yitzhak shamir 
remains committed to holding elections among palestinian arabs the 
white house announced friday 
the decision relayed by presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
represents an easing of pressure on israel it was taken after 
secretary of state james a baker iii consulted with key aides 
we are not sending anyone to israel at this time although it 
might be necessary at some later point to discuss the election 
proposal said fitzwater in paris with bush and baker for the 
economic summit meeting 
he added baker feels we do not need to do that now 
the decision reverses tentative plans by bush and baker to send a 
midlevel delegation from the state department to jerusalem next 
week there the officials were to meet with shamir about the 
hardline position taken by the prime minister and the likud party 
at a convention in tel aviv two weeks ago 
under pressure from hardliners shamir ruled out a palestinian 
state or relinquishing any of the territory israel holds on the west 
bank and in gaza shamir had also said that palestinians living in 
east jerusalem would not be permitted to participate in the 
elections and that balloting would begin only after violence in the 
territories ceased 
even though bush also is opposed to the establishment of a 
palestinian state he was sharply critical thursday of the stand 
taken by shamir and likud 
flying here for a sevennation economic summit the president 
said us policy against new jewish settlements on the west bank and 
in gaza had not changed 
i understand the political pressures he said of the 
development in israel but i cant be varying us policy every 
day to accommodate political change 
bush said israel was a friend of the united states and will 
remain a friend but i have to say what our policy is 
while bush said thursday that he would not send a highlevel 
emissary state department officials speaking on the condition of 
anonymity said midlevel us officials would be dispatched 
among those known to be included was dennis ross a key aideto 
baker who plays a leading role in us policy in the middle east 
in jerusalem yossi benaharon a top aide to shamir said the 
americans did not want to be seen as though they are interfering in 
the internal affairs of israel with regards to this minicrisis 
the centerleft labor party has said it may pull out of a 
governing coalition with shamirs rightwing likud bloc over likuds 
hardline stance 
for his part shamir told us members of the israel bonds drive 
that if they the united states want to send some delegation 
some envoys we will always welcome them

the naacp which usually prefers to wage its 
battles in the courtroom and the statehouse is taking to the 
streets to fight a series of supreme court rulings curtailing civil 
rights laws 
leaders of the nations oldest and largest civil rights group 
which usually takes a quiet behindthescenes approach are angered 
by what they see as a judicial threat to 35 years of gains for black 
americans 
for most of five days delegates to the national association for 
the advancement of colored peoples 80th annual convention gave a 
polite and often enthusiastic hearing to a parade of bush 
administration officials 
vice president dan quayle and bush cabinet members jack kemp and 
louis sullivan pledged their devotion to civil rights condemned 
racism and vowed to work to end the economic and social disparities 
between blacks and whites 
but the mood shifted dramatically as the fiveday gathering drew 
to a close thursday executive director benjamin hooks comparing 
the high courts conservative majority to the ku klux klan called 
for a silent march on the nations capital aug 26 
were not going to let four men and a woman in black robes turn 
us around any more than well let white robes turn us around 
hooks said referring to the garb traditionally worn by klan members 
the convention also suspended its rules thursday to condemn the 
high court and call for congress to reverse the rulings 
one michigan naacp leader explained the contrast between the warm 
welcome for administration officials and the sharp attack on 
republican policies and gopappointed judges 
the naacp is nonpartisan said tillman cothran a professor 
of sociology at western michigan university and president of the 
groups kalamazoo chapter it is only natural that we would hear 
people from both sides 
cothran said he remains skeptical of the bush administration 
gosh we enjoyed hearing housing and urban development 
secretary kemp saying stop exploiting poor people stop 
discrimination against minority group members in housing he 
said we wait to see to what extent his department will live up to 
those words 
the closingday fireworks thursday began with an address by 
eleanor holmes norton former chairwoman of the federal equal 
employment opportunity commission under president carter 
norton said blacks should give up on the reaganized federal 
courts and put the heat on congress and the president 
to george bush we say were glad youre not reagan but 
thats not enough she told the delegates 
the rev jesse jackson and national democratic chairman ronald 
brown challenged the notion that bush differs fundamentally from his 
predecessor on civil rights 
reagan laid the tracks to take the rights of workers and 
women and africanamericans and hispanics and the poor jackson 
said in the closing address thursday night bush is putting grease 
on those tracks not brakes 
i believe its time brown said that we tell george bush 
dan quayle jack kemp national gop chairman lee atwater and the 
rest of those republicans its time to put up or shut up 
after listening to five days of speeches philadelphia delegate 
gladys wylie said the words from the bush officials left her hopeful 
but cautious 
we think that this will be better than the reagan 
administration for minority people at least we hope it is 
anyway wylie said but it remains to be seen you can get up 
there and say anything

congressional negotiators breaking a 
procedural deadlock tentatively agreed friday to toughen proposed 
regulations on savings and loans as part of a 157 billion taxpayer 
bailout of the industry 
although nothing was adopted senate and house conferees moved 
toward embracing a combination of the toughest specific capital 
requirements in separate senate and house bills to make sampls back up 
loans with more of their own money 
the conferees are trying to meld some of the most stringent 
features of both bills aimed at reforming sampl abuses into one 
legislative package acceptable to both houses 
lax laws and accounting practices that let some thrifts lend 
federally insured deposits for risky and often fraudulent ventures 
while risking no money of their own is widely blamed as the chief 
factor behind the sampl crisis the largest financial debacle since 
the depression 
covering the estimated 100 billion in losses is expected to cost 
each of the nations taxpayers between 500 and 1500 over the next 
30 years 
differences in the way the house and senate have approached the 
sampl legislation flared thursday when the senate offered a 
comprehensive package and asked the house to counter with an 
allencompassing proposal of its own 
except for financing were not very far apart said sen 
jake garn of utah the ranking republican senator in the conference 
to go through them onebyone we might be here past labor day 
the chief house conferee rep henry b gonzalez dtexas 
balked calling the move a horrendous injustice to an earlier 
agreement to tackle onebyone each of the hundreds of differences 
between the two bills 
but after examining a rough outline of the senates proposal 
overnight gonzalez said friday that the two sides were so close 
on an overwhelming majority that the house would try to put 
together a counteroffer monday 
my intention is to provide a starting point for an overall 
settlement he told the senate negotiators i believe this 
provides the basis for us to resolve the impasse 
later friday however house conferees balked at gonzalezs 
suggestion to accept a senateproposed timetable that would make 
sampls meet the toughest of the new capital requirements immediately 
upon the bills enactment rather than in june 1990 as in the house 
bill 
we have to have some minimal amount of time before the 
regulations are issued said rep charles schumer dny one of 
the most vehement supporters of making sampl owners put more of their 
own money at risk 
as passed in its original form the senate bill would not have 
imposed the new requirements until june 1991 that issue like 
dozens of others remained unresolved 
nonetheless gonzalez said he was optimistic that the two sides 
can iron out their major differences by wednesday with the possible 
exception for how to raise the immediate 50 billion cost of the 
bailout 
to prevent the bailout from swelling the federal deficit 
president bush and the senate want to use 30year bonds to raise the 
money needed immediately to cover industry losses of federally 
insured deposits 
the house citing potential interest cost savings of 45 billion 
over the next three years wants to borrow the money directly 
through the treasury a move that would increase the annual deficits 
for fiscal 1990 1991 and 1992 by a total of 44 billion

far from the london stage where laurence 
olivier became the most celebrated actor of his time family and

in shakespeares works lavender savory marjoram marigold 
violets oxlips lilies pansies fennel columbine rue and daisies 
goodnight sweet prince and flights of angels wing thee to thy 
rest the words spoken by horatio in hamlet written on one of 
the many floral tributes summed up the nations feeling for the 
honored actor

small private service about 60 mourners gathered in the 12th 
century st jamess church beside a quiet country lane near his home

a single bell tolled as the heavy oak coffin was lifted from the 
hearse his widow actress joan plowright turned away briefly and 
wiped tears from her eyes as she stood silently with his four 
children and friends 
beside the casket in the church was oliviers battered red 
leather prayer book given to him by his mother when he was a child

lines from the shakespeare play one of oliviers most famous roles 
i have a journey sir shortly to go 
my master calls me i must not say no 
the weight of this sad time we must obey 
speak what we feel not what we ought to say 
the oldest hath borne most we that are young 
shall never see so much nor live so long 
the service began with one of oliviers favorite hymns the 
king of love my shepherd is it was sung last year at the

in singing the final hymn god be in my head 
after the service miss plowright got into a limousine with her 
two daughters tamsin 23 and juliekate 21 and the mourners 
drove across the sussex downs for a private cremation service at 
findon near worthing 
the family asked that anyone wishing to honor lord oliviers 
memory make a donation to the actors benevolent fund or cancer 
research or that trees should be planted to enrich and restore 
the countryside

the united states trying to knock down the last 
hurdles to its new third world debt strategy has promised to 
arrange as much as 2 billion in loans for financially strapped 
mexico officials said friday 
french president francois mitterrand said mexico burdened by a 
whopping 100 billion in foreign debt urgently needs help 
mexico he told french television is on the edge of an 
explosion because of the weight of its debt and the impossibility of 
carrying the burden 
no one he said has an interest in this explosion taking 
place which would mean more misery for a suffering people 
mexico is the test case of the bush administrations approach for 
easing the 13 trillion debt of poor nations the strategy 
representing a marked shift in us policy emphasizes debt 
reduction or forgiveness 
mexico has been holding intense negotiations with private banks 
to reach an accord to show off at the annual economic summit of the 
worlds seven big democracies which got under way friday 
but treasury secretary nicholas brady said it was unclear when 
mexico and private bankers would wind up their bargaining which 
began in midapril 
whether or not the negotiations will proceed far enough to have 
closure by this weekend we dont know we didnt set any 
deadlines he told a news conference but theyre in good 
shape 
the summit he said would be a suitable event to have that 
arrangement announced while we were here 
white house chief of staff john sununu emphasized earlier 
however that the quality of the solution is more important that 
the timetable 
the unrelieved debt problem was high on the summit agenda of 
president bush and the leaders of britain canada france west 
germany italy and japan they were expected to discuss it in detail 
saturday 
the summit began at the same time that france was marking the 
200th anniversary of its revolution a celebration that has 
attracted some threedozen leaders of the worlds richest and 
poorest nations the poor have taken the opportunity to lobby their 
wealthier counterparts for help 
but it was highly unlikely the rich democracies would respond 
with any dramatic proposal 
nigel lawson britains chancellor of the exchequer said what 
is important is we have agreed on this extension of the debt 
strategy referring to the brady plan 
and the commerical banks need to be absolutely clear there is 
no new initiative coming forward he said that is the position 
and it is up to them to negotiate a debtreduction agreement with 
the debtor countries starting with mexico 
bush held a hastily arranged meeting friday morning with mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari to discuss the debt issues 
salinas de gortari met earlier in the week with german chancellor 
helmut kohl and japanese prime minister sousuke uno to press his 
case 
white house officials confirmed reports that the united states 
was willing to arrange a 1 billion to 2 billion bridge loan to 
help mexico meet its financial obligations until a final debt deal 
is in place 
we would be willing to do this with other countries if mexico 
and the their banks can get together brady said we have 
indications that other industrialized nations would be willing to 
join as well 
mexico has received similar loans from the united states in the 
past to help it close the gap between its financial obligations and 
the amount of money left in its coffers a bridge loan helps sweeten 
a deal because it ensures bankers the debtor nation will continue 
making interest payments 
mexico which is believed to be running low on foreign reserves 
is the developing worlds second largest debtor after brazil mexico 
owes private lenders 54 billion with about 15 billion due 
american banks 
in its negotiations with a 15member bank panel mexico has 
pressed for sharp cuts in both its overall debt and its annual 
interest fees which run about 10 billion a year by reducing those 
charges the mexican government would have more money left from 
foreign earnings to pump into its flat economy 
mexico wants to cut its annual interest fees from 6 percent of 
its gross domestic product the total value of a nations economic 
output to 2 percent 
it went into the talks demanding a 55 percent discount on a 
portion of its 54 billion private debt bankers countered with a 22 
percent discount the two sides sources said have tentatively 
centered on a 35 percent cut 
to do that negotiators are discussing a variety of options 
including swapping old debt for new guaranteed bonds and putting 
up new loans to dilute the debt concentration

a onetime housing and urban development 
official friday contradicted former hud secretary samuel pierces 
sworn statement that he had no direct role in approving financing 
for agency projects 
shirley mcvay wiseman former assistant secretary for housing at 
hud testified under oath that pierce instructed her to approve more 
than 15 million for a durham nc project being pushed by a 
former law partner of pierce 
i want the project funded wiseman quoted pierce as saying 
she offered her account in testimony before the house government 
operations subcommittee on employment and housing one of three 
congressional panels investigating the burgeoning hud scandal 
wiseman said she told pierce she could not approve his request 
because career hud employees were violently opposed to it 
janet hale who succeeded wiseman at hud said she felt she was 
acting on the approval of my boss when she did approve the 
project in 1985 
hale said department procedure required that she formally sign 
the funding documents but she said pierces signature was already 
on the documents approving funding for the durham project which 
involved the conversion of a hosiery mill into apartments 
after the secretary had given the approval i was implementing 
his instructions said hale 
whether pierce actually signed the documents referred to by ms 
hale was not clear other witnesses have said deborah gore dean 
pierces executive assistant often used an electronic autopen 
to affix pierces signature to agency documents 
as a result of huds approval the developers received more than 
113 million in rent subsidies a 23 million urban development 
action grant and more than 3 million in tax credits said rep tom 
lantos dcalif chairman of the subcommittee 
in may pierce told the subcommittee he set up a threeperson 
panel at the agency to make funding decisions for the moderate 
rehabilitation program one of the programs involved in the durham 
project 
however pierce said he maintained final authority over the hud 
committees decisions 
i did not plan however to get into the decisionmaking process 
of the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doing so 
he said 
efforts by the associated press to reach pierce for comment 
friday were unsuccessful 
the factual noose seems to be tightening around samuel pierces 
neck said rep charles schumer dny a member of the house 
banking committee 
we were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried to 
influence any project and we have two people making it very clear 
that he wanted a particular project funded said rep christopher 
shays rconn 
i want to give him every opportunity to clarify the apparent 
contradictions said lantos he said the committee would seek to 
recall pierce before congress takes a recess on aug 4 
in response to a question from shays wiseman also contradicted a 
statement ms dean gave to investigators from the hud inspector 
generals office during an interview for their audit of the moderate 
rehabilitation program 
dean had said wiseman served on the internal panel 
i did not serve on a committee and i didnt know it existed 
she said 
hale said she deferred signing three waivers in the spring of 
1985 that would qualify the durham project for federal aid even 
though she was directed to approve them by dean 
she said she was uneasy about the directive because of unanimous 
opposition to the project from department professionals and sought 
a personal meeting with pierce hale said she spoke to pierce about 
having a meeting but that one never took place 
she said among her questions were concerns about possible toxic 
waste at the mill site she said other department aides assured her 
there was no evidence of such waste at the site but she said she 
was never shown any documentation 
lants read from a memo dated sept 24 1984 a year earlier 
noting complaints from hud field staff members that they had been 
pressured by the central office not to mention environmental 
problems at the site 
i was told the secretary wanted it deborah asked me to sign 
the waivers i was told to sign them and i did hale testified 
the panel also questioned the pair about another troubled hud 
entity the coinsurance mortgage program 
wiseman testified that drg funding corp the largest private 
lender that underwrote mortgages in the 5 billion program was 
removed from administrative probation despite concerns about the 
company among hud professionals the company now is under fbi 
investigation 
she said drgs ability to underwrite mortgages had been placed on 
hold because of infractions of department rules and former hud 
secretary carla hills met with her in late 1984 or early 1985 to get 
the restrictions lifted it was not a convincing argument 
wiseman said and the restrictions were left in place 
it was later brought to my attention that hills had taken 
the case to secretary pierce i was informed by staff that there was 
a meeting and drgs probation was lifted she said 
citing one drg project colonial house in texas which was 
approved on sept 11 1984 after the mortgage companys probation 
was lifted lantos said the project went belly up 
drg had coinsured a loan of 472 million for the project which 
sold for 89 million under the program hud is liable for about 80 
percent of any defaults 
hills is scheduled to testify before the committee monday

the captain of a greek tanker who already 
faced federal pollution charges after the ship ran aground off 
newport spilling thousands of gallons of oil on friday was 
indicted on two state felony counts

a harbor pilot on board the world prodigy at the time of the june 23 
spill and with polluting the coastal waters attorney general james 
e oneil said 
the coast guard says about 300000 gallons of toxic no 2 heating 
oil spilled into rhode island sound at the entrance to narragansett 
bay most of the oil which was lighter than the crude oil that has 
fouled alaska waters since march has now been cleaned up or 
dissipated 
the failure to have a pilot on board carries a potential penalty 
of 10000 and one year in jail oneil said the pollution count 
carries up to 30 days in jail and a 10000 fine oneil however 
indicated that georgudis 43 was unlikely to spend time in jail 
even if convicted 
what were looking at here are fines right now oneil said 
georgudis who is in new york city where the ship is being 
repaired likely will surrender to rhode island authorities within 
the next week to 10 days for arraignment oneil said 
the attorney general said georgudis attorney michael dibiase

the indictment charges that georgudis ran the world prodigy onto 
the rocks through gross negligence 
the ships helmsman testified during the coast guard inquiry that 
he spotted a red buoy warning of the reef on the left side of the

approached the harbor but he did not tell the captain

tried to warn it away from the rocks three times but saw no response 
oneil said most of his offices efforts were going to recovering 
the costs of the spill from the ships owner ballard shiopping co 
the coast guard has estimated the costs at almost 2 million but 
oneil said the state costs were not fully tallied 
the attorney general said ballard and its insurance company so 
far had cooperated in the assessment of damages 
were fortunate theyre insured were fortunate they have an 
owner who seems to have some social conscience oneil said

ola fareh awad is among 
thousands of palestinian teenagers enmeshed in the israeli judicial 
system because of stonethrowing and could be sent to prison for 20 
years 
miss awad a 14yearold american citizen who lives in this 
palestinian village north of jerusalem is accused along with three 
friends of acting with intention to endanger public life by 
throwing rocks at an intercity bus in december 
she was 13 at the time and says they were innocent bystanders 
we were walking home from school and saw the bus stop she 
said in an interview jewish people got out and started shooting 
in the air we were scared and ran away but they caught us and hit 
us and said we threw the stones 
uzi hasson the israeli chief prosecutor said no one was hurt 
but the glass in the rear door of the bus was broken and the 
passengers were endangered 
we are pursuing the case because we take stonethrowing very 
seriously he said i dont wish anybody to be in such an 
attack you are helpless if youre driving it can be very 
dangerous 
more than 1500 israeli soldiers and civilians have been injured 
nearly all by stones since the palestinian uprising in the west 
bank and gaza strip began more than 19 months ago 
at least 560 palestinians and 35 israelis have been killed 
mainly by gunfire or means other than stones and more than 8000 
palestinians have been wounded 
hasson said conviction on the charge against the girls carries a 
maximum of 20 years but the average jail sentence has been about 15 
months 
jawad boulos miss awads lawyer said the case could drag on for 
months because of overloaded court calendars 
i think this is symptomatic of the insanity of the israeli 
judicial system he said they are trying to teach the girls a 
lesson and deter them and others from having a part in the uprising 
this isnt the way to influence people 
miss awad said interrogators slapped her and threatened to put 
her in jail if she refused to confess before being sent home she 
and her mother jamileh had to sign a statement agreeing to an 
automatic threemonth prison sentence if ola was detained for 
another alleged offense 
apparently because she was only 13 at the time her arrest 
authorities allowed miss awad to return to her ninth grade class at 
the holy rosary school her palestinian companions aged 15 and 16 
were held for several months in a makeshift detention center in a 
convent then put under house arrest 
ola awad never lived in the united states but her father worked 
in los angeles until his death in 1983 she is among 16 holders of 
american passports who have been caught up in the judicial system 
since the uprising began 
according to the army nearly 8600 palestinians from the west 
bank and gaza strip are in detention in cases related to the 
uprising most of them involving stonethrowing 
about 7000 palestinianamericans are among the 1 million arabs 
in the west bank us officials estimate about 100 holders of us 
passports are among the gaza strips 700000 residents 
the americans in detention include mansour abed al samad 16 
born in puerto rico he was sentenced in june to 10 months in jail 
after conviction on charges of erecting road barriers 
cases are pending against usama nazmi 17 formerly of milwaukee 
wis for allegedly throwing stones at soldiers and suzane abu 
nijmeh 16 formerly of cicero ill accused of participating in an 
antiisraeli demonstration 
palestinianamericans do not get special treatment 
catherine barry a consulate officer said american officials 
visit the detainees but do not intervene in judicial proceedings 
our primary interest is seeing that they are treated humanely 
and equitably she said we have to respect the legal systems 
the jerusalem branch of the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee believes this is not enough and said in a statement 
lack of effective action by the us government will invite 
further israeli violations of the rights of american nationals of 
palestinian origin 
it has taken up the case of jaafar hamayel 25 a 
palestinianamerican who was detained without charge may 28 and is 
being interrogated in an israeli prison on suspicion of antiisraeli 
activities 
hamayel an accounting student at the interamerican university of 
puerto rico returned to his village of kufr malik in april to renew 
his identity card he must have the card issued by israel to 
return to the west bank 
his lawyer jonathan kuttab accused government interrogators of 
depriving hamayel of food and sleep forcing him to stand with a 
sack over his head and handcuffing him in uncomfortable positions 
i dont know of any country in the world where a us citizen 
can be held for so long and interrogated so roughly without any 
charges kuttab said

a principal who told officials that 
students needed teachers more than they needed him at his 
financially pressed elementary school of 200 was out of a job friday 
some board members had tears in their eyes thursday night when 
they voted unanimously to lay off principal norman najimy his 
teachers wept openly 
this was the shortest and saddest meeting in our history 
said board member donna slowick 
no one seemed to believe it would really happen but me 
najimy a teacher for 37 years said by telephone friday but with 
the governors announcement of further state aid cuts there was no 
way 
hours before the school committee met gov michael dukakis 
announced he was vetoing 491 million in state spending including 
cuts in community and education aid because of the states own 
fiscal problems 
he is a public servant a teacher who stood up to be counted 
and put his own personal welfare behind what is best for the kids 
said fred williams deputy state education commissioner our 
hearts go out to the parents kids teachers and the school 
committee who had to make a very difficult decision 
i didnt want to go i still have one child in college said 
najimy as friends and distraught parents rallied around him and 
several school superintendents called with job offers but what 
would you do with the children without teachers 
maintaining the children needed the teachers more najimy 
suggested last month that richmond could save about 40000 by 
firing him and paying a teacher an extra 3000 to run the school 
building faculty is the hardest thing to do he said at the 
time if we lose our teachers we will never get them back 
the irony is we had built an awardwinning school najimy 
said last year the school was cited by the massachusetts 
organization for school improvement and the state education 
department najimy was named a fellow of the commonwealth leadership 
academy and commissioned by the education department to conduct a 
study of the future of education 
educators in several states are using my monograph to plan 
their programs for the 1990s najimy said and here i am looking 
for a job 
a professional shakespearian company also spent 12 weeks in 
residence at the school under a state arts council grant a 
studentbuilt nature trail illustrated with the childrens own 
poetry was created with the help of a poet and a master 
calligrapher who brought their art into the classrooms 
i think the thing that makes me the angriest is the hypocrisy 
of saying that education is the key to our future at the same time 
we are unwilling to give the children the resources to cope with a 
legacy of 2 trillion in debt a polluted environment and other 
social problems najimy said

the senate armed services committee gave a 
strong endorsement friday to production of the b2 stealth bomber 
and approved defense secretary dick cheneys proposal to end 
production of the f14d fighter jet 
but the committee in its 305 billion fiscal 1990 defense bill 
voted to keep alive the controversial v22 osprey tiltrotor 
aircraft inviting cheney to change his mind about canceling the 
program 
committee chairman sam nunn dga and sen john warner rva 
the senior republican on the panel said the final bill was approved 
unanimously 
at a news conference nunn and warner expressed strong support 
for the b2 program but nunn said he had sticker shock from the 
high costs of producing the bomber 
if that plane doesnt fly the debates over nunn said 
its far too expensive to be a stealth taxi 
the plane designed to evade soviet radar has yet to fly but the 
first test could come as soon as saturday the plane has been 
undergoing runway testing this week in palmdale calif 
the committee voted to increase spending on the strategic defense 
initiative by 800 million next year to 45 billion which is 
still 366 million below the administration request 
we expect to be severely challenged on the floor on that 
nunn said 
the committee also 
endorsed a 36 percent military pay raise along with increases 
in flight pay and medical benefits 
earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste at 
department of energy military nuclear facilities members approved 
18 billion 418 million above the administration request 
additional money would also be provided for research on new cleanup 
techniques 
included 100 million for research on the proposed aerospace 
plane which would take off and land like a regular jet but fly at 
great speeds in the upper atmosphere 
provided 30 million for developing lighter and better infantry 
weapons 
the b2 is considered the most expensive plane in history with 
development costs added each will cost between 500 million and 
650 million and the military intends to buy 132 over the next few 
years 
the senate committee trimmed 300 million from the 
administrations 47 billion request for the b2 program next year 
and included in its bill a series of testing requirements before the 
plane could go into full production then the cost of each plane 
must be held to 295 million after development costs nunn said 
the jet if successful could force the soviets to totally revamp 
their air defense system at a cost far exceeding the b2 price tag 
nunn said 
the decision to cut the f14d was a tough one nunn said adding 
that he felt obligated to back cheney in his effort to control 
defense spending 
the house committee overruled both cheney and its own chairman 
voting to authorize production of the newest version of the f14d 
warner said there was similar sentiment in the senate panel but 
the two of us stood there like a stone wall 
the senate committee also approved cheneys request to end 
several other weapons programs including production of the f15e 
fighter after fiscal 1991 the apache helicopter after fiscal 1991 
the army helicopter improvement program the phoenix missile the 
m88 tankrecovery tow vehicle and an ssn688 nuclear submarine 
the exception came when the committee voted to keep alive the 
osprey which takes off like a helicopter then flies like an 
airplane the marine corps is backing the program but cheney 
decided to cancel it 
the committee bill would complete development of the aircraft but 
not begin production nunn said the committee is hopeful the 
defense department would find a way to justify production of the 
plane

coal miners in one siberian city ended a fourday 
strike friday but work stoppages spread to at least seven other 
cities in the region tass reported 
the official news agency said miners had added political demands 
to the original issues of better food and working conditions 
miners in mezhdurechensk siberia where the strike began monday 
night went back to work for the friday night shift the official 
news agency said the workers leaders and management had reached a 
settlement on thursday 
a settlement was reached friday evening in the city of osinika 
tass said but did not give further details 
strikes also were reported in prokopevski novokuznetsk 
kisilevsk leninkuznetsk berezovski and kemerov tass reported 
late friday night 
early reports said about 12000 men struck mezhdurechensks five 
mines and that there were walkouts in 10 cities later reports only 
mentioned eight cities and did not say how many miners were involved 
outside mezhdurechensk 
no violence was reported in the strikes 
before returning to work the miners in mezhdurechensk held 
rallies outside their pits friday night to demand that communist 
party and government leaders visit the kuzbass region tass said 
it said the strike committee in mezhdurechensk a city of 110000 
people about 1600 miles east of moscow also demanded that a new 
national constitution be adopted by next year 
explaining the mens dissatisfaction miner nikolai yatsenko said 
in an interview with the government newspaper izvestia 
we were told for years put out more coal and dont worry 
about anything well feed you and dress you give you housing and 
childcare centers houses of culture and sport and we worked our 
heads off put out coal and now we hear not only do you have to 
put out coal you have to take care of yourself in everything else 
too 
how do we do that yatsenko asked no matter who you turn 
to with your requests and complaints no good comes of it only 
promises 
among the workers 30 demands when the strike began were economic 
independence for the mines extended vacations for underground 
workers and improved food and housing the labor daily trud reported 
alexander kolmogorov a worker in mezhdurechensk said greater 
financial independence for individual mines and increased 
nightshift pay were among the demands a government negotiating 
commission agreed to meet immediately 
providing better food and housing would take more time he said 
in the past the soviet union has brutally repressed strikes and 
hushed them up but walkouts by miners this year generally have 
ended in a few days with government concessions 
similar strikes were reported in march and april in the urals 
mountain city of vorkuta and norilsk in siberia both ended without 
incident 
twentyfour miners were said to be staying underground at 
alexandria in the ukraine with demands similar to those made in 
mezhdurechensk 
izvestia reported friday that tens of thousands of people were 
crowding the central square in mezhdurechensk day and night 
kolmogorov said compatriots in the other kuzbass cities seemed to 
be demonstrating belated solidarity perhaps not knowing the 
government had agreed on thursday to meet nearly all the strikers 
demands for the entire region 
theres a weak information connection and this is happening by 
chain reaction he said in a telephone interview from the strike 
headquaters at his mine 
in an open letter to the soviet government the mezhdurechensk 
strike committee has demanded food supplies for miners in 
accordance with dieticians norms and that all privileges for 
mine officials be abolished tass reported 
a letter from mezhdurechensk miners published by trud in january 
complained that more than 10000 families were waiting for 
apartments hospitals and clinics were as crowded as anthills 
with patients waiting a week or more to see a doctor and schools 
had two or three times as many students as they were designed to 
accommodate

proposed rules that would allow president bush 
to plead national security and block takeover of a us firm by 
foreigners were published for public comment friday by the treasury 
department 
sen james exon dneb and rep james j florio dnj who 
were responsible for parts of the law praised the proposed 
regulations published in the federal register comments may be 
submitted by sept 12 although the treasury said later comments 
will be considered if possible 
the trade act signed by former president reagan last august 
provides authority for the rules that would allow the president to 
block a merger if he has credible evidence that the foreign interest 
taking control might act to hurt us security if he decides on an 
investigation he gets 30 days to begin it 45 days to complete it 
and another 15 days to announce it 
florio said the treasury has interpreted the law broadly to make 
sure that it covers different ways that a foreign firm could take 
over an american one a joint venture buying up the assets and 
defaults on loans as well as just buying a majority interest 
in my view all methods by which foreign control may be 
accomplished must be covered including proxy solicitations which 
are certainly as viable a means of establishing control as equity 
ownership he added in a statement 
a proxy authorizes a person to cast the vote of stock owned by 
someone else if an acquiring company gets enough proxies it can 
take over a firm without paying a premium price for the stock 
i am very pleased with action taken by the secretary of the 
treasury exon told the assocated press in an interview the 
regulations carry out the commitment he made to us

a secret service officer who admitted a 
lobbyist and his party to the white house for a private latenight 
tour is on administrative leave as the agency investigates possible 
procedural violations a spokeswoman said friday 
jane vezeris said the secret service is pursuing its internal 
investigation into the activities of officer reginald degueldre 
very aggressively and finds the allegations that degueldre may 
have accepted gifts from the lobbyist very concerning 
degueldre who has acknowledged giving lobbyist craig j spence a 
white house tour on july 3 1988 around 11 pm was placed on 
administrative leave with pay recently but vezeris said she did not 
know the date 
spence who was a registered foreign agent for japan until 1987 
has been linked by the washington times to a homosexual prostitution 
ring that is under investigation by us attorney jay stephens the 
prosecutor said he is examining possible credit card fraud in the 
ring which was broken up in february 
the newspaper said it has obtained copies of vouchers indicating 
spence was a customer 
vezeris said the agencys internal probe was taking longer that 
usual because agents did not want to interfere with stephens 
criminal investigation 
the times reported that degueldre organized at least four private 
white house tours for spence including one on which two male 
prostitutes were in the party 
degueldre also told another secret service officer that he 
snatched china from the white house and he told the times he 
accepted an 8000 gold rolex watch from spence 
vezeris said the secret service doesnt view a private tour as a 
breach of security because white house officials and uniformed 
officers are permitted to give friends and relatives a peek at the 
west wing site of the oval office 
but the service wants to determine if degueldre received 
possible favors in return for his hospitality she said 
degueldre did not return a telephone message left on his machine 
friday 
in an affidavit supporting a search warrant for degueldres house 
last week secret service special agent paul weare said degueldre 
had admitted stealing from the presidential living quarters several 
pieces of china dating from the truman presidency 
weare said degueldre admitted that he gave one piece of the 
china to craig spence who had it prominently displayed at his home 
in washington 
degueldre has denied committing any thefts or breaking any other 
laws or breaching security 
the times in a story published friday quoted unidentified 
secret service officers as saying another uniformed officer who 
worked the midnight shift at the white house with degueldre has been 
reassigned vezeris said she knew nothing about a second officer 
meantime rose zamaria a white house official said there has 
been no change in policy regarding late night tours of the building 
since a memorandum she issued in midjune 
in the bush administration white house staff members can bring 
guests on private tours of the west wing on monday wednesday and 
friday between 7 pm and 10 pm after 1 pm on saturday and all 
day on sunday

the senate will act this fall on both a 
constitutional amendment and a lesssweeping statute designed to 
overcome last months supreme court ruling that allows flag burning 
senate majority leader george mitchell said friday 
mitchells announcement represented a compromise between those 
seeking quick action on an amendment and those urging caution before 
modifying the constitution however by scheduling a senate vote on 
the amendment mitchell increased pressure on a resistant house 
speaker thomas s foley to do the same 
it is my belief that this is a serious matter of importance to 
all americans said mitchell dmaine adding that the compromise 
schedule would let the senate approach the issue in a serious 
mature deliberate way 
republican leader sen bob dole rkan on tuesday will 
introduce the constitutional amendment supported by president bush 
dole said mitchells agreement ensures that opponents of a 
constitutional amendment wont be able to use the statute to scuttle 
further action 
that satisfies the concerns that we might pass a statute 
and say well thats the end of it dole said 
under the bipartisan agreement the senate judiciary committee 
would hold hearings and then report both approaches to the full 
senate by sept 22 
committee chairman joseph biden ddel would bring up the 
statute just before a senate recess in early october and the 
constitutional amendment would lead the senate schedule right after 
the recess 
a majority of the senate including members from both parties 
has agreed to cosponsor the constitutional amendment said dole 
spokesman walt riker 
under the constitution a twothirds vote in both chambers is 
required a constitutional amendment also requires ratification by 
the states 
the house constitutional law subcommittee has begun hearings and 
the full house could act on a statute before the august 
congressional recess statute supporters including foley dwash 
hope passions for a constitutional amendment may cool after the 
summer break 
a top aide to house republican leader bob michel rill who is 
cosponsoring the constitutional amendment said mitchells 
announcement will turn up the burners here in the house 
the aide who spoke on the condition his name not be used said 
if house leaders block a floor vote on the constitutional amendment 
the bill would be taken out of the house judiciary committee by a 
discharge petition 
if the senate passes a constitutional amendnent i expect a 
discharge petition would happen pretty quick he said

sen jesse helms rnc offered legislation 
on friday barring the united states from negotiating with the 
palestine liberation organization unless president bush certifies 
none of the plo participants were ever terrorists involved in the 
death injury or kidnapping of an american 
helms said his amendment to a pending statre department 
authorization bill was a reaction to published reports that us 
ambassador robert pelletreau has held talks in tunisia with abu 
iyad the plos no 2 official 
helms identified iyad as a key member of the black september 
terrorist groupwhich murdered a group of athletes at the 1972 
olympic games in munich and conducted a number of assasinations and 
hijackings including the murder of cleo noel the us ambassador 
to sudan in 1973 
this amendment poses a simple clearcut question should us 
officials negotiate with terrorists responsible for the deaths of 
innocent americans helms asked 
the amendment which will be debated next week appears intended 
at derailing the usplo talks begun after plo chairman yasser 
arafat recognized the right of israel to exist a condition set by 
the united states 
it was not clear what action the senate might take or whether the 
amendment stands a chance of becoming law 
while the name of abu iyad may not be well known to our ears 
the murder of innocent people which he directed still echoes in 
our memory helms said 
the state department is involved in negotiations with a man who 
murdered americans helms said 
despite abu iyads histopry of crimes against americans the 
state department has now endowed upon him the respectibility 
inherrent in serving as a negotiating partner with the united 
states he said by so doing it has sent a signal to other 
terrorists that violence can pay

the senate voted 8110 on friday to impose 
economic sanctions against china and to urge president bush to take 
even harshar measures 
the legislation was offered by senate majority leader george 
mitchell of maine to express to the government of china the 
concern which the american people feel about the continuing 
prosecution of chinese students and workers who support the 
prodemocracy movement mitchell said 
it calls on bush to make sure the leaders of china understand 
that until they recognize the chinese peoples legitimate desire 
for democracy human rights and justice that relations between our 
two countries will remain strained 
the sanctions amendment was attached to pending legislation 
authorizing 466 billion for the state department and allied 
agencies during the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 
reacting to the senate action white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters in paris we feel that the united states 
has imposed sanctions that are meaningful and that adequately convey 
our sense of condemnation of the events that occurred in china we 
also believe that we need to be mindful of longterm relationships 
with that country as we move forward 
he said there is a fair degree of unanimity among the united 
states summit partners on the issue 
he said the administration would consider the legislation but 
generally speaking we think we have taken the right course that 
that has been recognized by other nations of the world we feel its 
also supported and recognized by the american public 
mitchell noted that while the amendment requires the president to 
suspend certain trade programs it also has a provision which 
gives him the flexibility to cease any suspension or termination 
if he finds it in the security interest of the united states to 
do so 
the measure adopts several sanctions adopted earlier by the house 
these include sixmonth suspensions of trade insurance by the 
overseas private investment corp and the use of us funds to 
support trade with china 
other sanctions include the suspension of export of satellites 
intended to be launched by china and the suspension of nuclear 
cooperation until the president can certify china is not involved in 
nuclear proliferation 
the senate also adopted a series of nonbinding suggestions in 
which they urged bush to take stiffer steps he should the senate 
said 
direct the exportimport bank to immediately postpone approval 
of applications for financing american exports to china 
instruct us representatives at international financial 
institutions to oppose all loans to china 
review the advisability of continuing to extend to china 
mostfavorednation trade treatment 
review all trade agreements between the two countries 
review commercial agreements governing chineseamerican 
cooperation on satellite launches 
review the chineseamerican agreement on the peaceful uses of 
atomic energy 
consult with us allies at the upcoming economic summit in 
paris on adopting a collective economic response to repression in 
china 
review high technology exports to china 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas endorsed the 
amendment saying the chinese government has shown no signs of 
relenting in its persecution of those who took part in or appeared 
to encourage the prodemocracy demonstrations 
they are still sliding down a very slippery and dangerous 
slope dole said

a federal appeals court friday ordered the 
interior department to rewrite rules for cleaning up after oil 
spills saying costs must include more than just the monetary value 
of animals killed 
the decision could affect damage payments made by oil companies 
involved in spills such as the march 24 accident that occurred when 
the tanker exxon valdez dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil in 
alaskas pristine prince william sound 
environmentalists hailed the unanimous decision by the 
threejudge panel of the us court of appeals 
we think its a major victory for the environment because it 
means that polluters will no longer get off the hook and they will 
have to pay for the whole cost of spills said erik olson of the 
national wildlife federation one of the private organizations that 
joined with 10 states to bring the lawsuit 
rep robert torricelli dnj said the action makes oil 
companies more responsible 
if the bush administration appeals the ruling it means 
president bushs pledge to hold exxons feet to the fire is nothing 
more than a cynical exercise he said 
the court ordering the rules rewritten said the interior 
department had drawn the regulations too narrowly in trying to 
implement the 1977 clean water act and the 1980 superfund law 
department spokesman al levitt said the agency had just received 
the ruling and would have no immediate comment the ruling he said 
was being discussed with justice department officials but no 
decision had been made about whether to appeal 
the 1986 laws in question require the interior department to 
design regulations to determine the monetary costs of oil spills 
the department had created a computer model listing the lost use 
values for various types of wildlife 
for example the cost of a fur seal was set at 15 based on the 
expected value of a seal pelt the cost of geese ranged up to 35 
based on their popularity among hunters 
but the appeals court said congress had intended that the 
repayment plan be more broadly drawn to consider not simply the 
value of lost wildlife but the larger cost of restoring the damaged 
environment to its previous condition 
the limited regulation is directly contrary to the clearly 
expressed intent of congress as is therefore invalid the court 
said 
because in some probably a majority of cases 
lostusevalue will be lower than the cost of restoration 
interiors rule will result in damages awards too small to pay for 
the costs or restoration the ruling said 
the interior department has not set a damage assessment for 
either the alaskan spill or three smaller spills last month along 
the eastern and southern us coasts

an oil tanker sailed past a syrian naval 
blockade friday and docked at a christian port triggering an 
artillery duel between syrian and christian gunners that killed 
seven people and wounded 12 
the thud of exploding shells and whooshing sound of rockets 
echoed across beirut as syrian gunners opened up on the 
christiancontrolled coast north of the capital the fighting 
continued late into the night 
a police spokesman said the unidentified tanker which arrived at 
an undisclosed harbor north of beirut was the second to reach the 
christian enclave in the past two days with a cargo of badly needed 
fuel 
on wednesday another tanker unloaded gasoline at byblos port 18 
miles north of the capital 
the deaths from the artillery duel raised the overall toll to 416 
killed and 1627 wounded since the current confrontation erupted 
march 8 between christian army commander gen michel aouns 20000 
troops and syrias 40000member force in lebanon 
a spokesman for aouns command speaking on condition of 
anonymity said a syrian gunboat intercepted the latest tanker in 
lebanese territorial waters early in the day searched it for 
weapons and ammunition and allowed the captain to resume his 
voyage 
i dont understand why syrian gunners shelled the ship after 
the syrian gunboat permitted it to continue said the spokesman 
who refused to give any details about the tanker and its cargo 
citing security considerations 
he said the syrians shelled the christian coast from positions in 
moslem west beirut and the northern town of salaata on the edge of 
the 310squaremile enclave 
he said aouns gunners scored several direct hits on syrian 
artillery emplacements in beirut and the north however the claim 
could not be independently verified 
shells exploded near the american university of beirut in the 
citys moslem sector witnesses said 
the syrian military headquarters in beirut refused to comment 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing 
rules said syrian barrage concentrated on the 28mile christian 
stretch of lebanons 130mile mediterranean coast 
the syrians have besieged the christian enclave since march 12 in 
retaliation for a blockade aoun ordered of illegal ports run by 
syrianbacked militias south of beirut that he said were depriving 
his government of 100 million a year in tax revenue 
the syrian navy joined the blockade earlier this month after 
syria claimed aoun obtained sovietdesigned frog7 missiles from its 
traditional arab rival iraq the missiles are capable of hitting 
damascus the syrian capital 
aoun and his aides have refused to confirm or deny that they have 
frog7 missiles but iraq said thursday that aoun has the missiles 
which have a range of more than 40 miles 
an editorial in the official daily newspaper althawra 
controlled by president saddam husseins ruling arab socialist baath 
party said syria was expressing fear of missiles received by the 
regular lebanese army it did not elaborate 
syria and iraq are ruled by rival wings of the baath party 
iraq has declared support for aouns war of liberation 
against syrian forces which entered lebanon in 1976 under an arab 
league peacekeeping mandate 
aoun and other christian leaders accuse the syrians of betraying 
their mandate by siding with the moslems in the 14yearold civil 
war which has killed more than 150000 people

authorities are barring vietnamese 
boat people from landing in this country and at least 16 boats with 
nearly 900 people have been sent away to indonesia a un official 
said friday 
the un high commissioner for refugees is surprised and 
disappointed in the new policy said the agencys local 
representative jean marie fakhouri the new malaysian policy began 
around may 25 without any notice to the un agency 
malaysian officials were not available to respond to fakhouris 
criticism but foreign minister abu hassan omar and other officials 
have said repeatedly over the past few months that malaysia was 
getting fed up with the crush of vietnamese refugees 
malaysia now has 22000 of them down from a peak of 76500 in 
june 1979 
speaking in a telephone interview fakhouri said officials of the 
un agency do not know exactly how many boats that landed in 
malaysia have been towed back out to sea 
but he said at least 16 boats with 886 people have been sent away 
he said those boats were towed away between the end of may 
shortly after the new policy went into effect and july 7 however 
he said the policy apparently is continuing 
he said in one incident in midjune a boat with about 40 
refugees capsized as it was being towed to the south china sea off 
the east coast of this southeast asian country 
a 23yearold refugee drowned but the others in the boat were 
picked up put into another boat a week later and towed away 
fakhouri said 
he said that so far all the expelled boats appear to have landed 
in nearby indonesia he said indonesian authorities were allowing 
the refugees to stay 
on march 14 joining other members of the association of 
southeast asian nations malaysia imposed a policy of screening boat 
people to find those who were simply economic refugees such people 
would then be sent back to vietnam 
however vietnam has said repatriation must be voluntary 
malaysia is still adhering to its policy of allowing temporary 
asylum to refugees already here they are to be permanently 
resettled in the united states australia canada and other 
countries 
in 1979 malaysia officials also towed some boats away but they 
stopped after a few weeks when western nations promised to take more 
boat people

solidarity leader lech walesa said friday 
that poland needs a president immediately to resolve a 
constitutional crisis and he will support anyone the communist 
party puts up 
the president is to be elected by a joint vote of the both houses 
of the new parliament in which solidarity is strongly represented 
gen wojciech jaruzelski the communist party chief said june 30 
he would not run for the new more powerful presidency because he 
was too closely linked with the martial law he imposed in december 
1981 to crush solidarity 
under agreements signed in april the independent labor union was 
made legal again and poland held its freest postwar elections in 
which solidarity trounced the communist party 
in a statement released by an aide walesa said friday i will 
cooperate with any president elected no matter if it is gen 
jaruzelski gen czeslaw kiszczak or some other representative of 
the communist party in order to solve polish problems 
when jaruzelski said he would not seek the presidency he 
recommended kiszczak who is interior minister and negotiated the 
april accords with solidarity but the party leadership asked him to 
reconsider his own candidacy 
jaruzelski has reemerged as a likely candidate especially after 
appearing frequently with george bush during the american 
presidents threeday visit 
walesa said polands domestic and international situation 
requires a president and the election should be held 
immediately 
our country faces a great chance but at the same time we have 
a constitutional crisis connected with a delay in filling the 
presidents office he said extension of this situation causes 
additional dangers mikolaj kozakiewicz speaker of the sejm the 
former unicameral parliament and now the lower house said thursday 
the election might take place by july 22 polands national day 
kozakiewicz said the bush visit had eased controversy about 
jaruzelskis candidacy but many solidarity legislators were jailed 
during martial law and have said they will not vote for jaruzelski 
walesa is not a member of the parliament and in his statement 
did not instruct solidarity representatives how to vote

battle with alzheimers disease introduced legislation friday to 
pump hundreds of millions of dollars into efforts to find a cure 
the legislation would quadruple federal research spending to 500 
million by 1992 and provide additional money for services to help 
victims and their families 
researchers say that one or two additional steps we could 
find that link that might well solve alzheimers disease sen 
larry pressler rsd said at a news conference 
alzheimers an irreversible neurological disease that often robs 
its victims of their memory intellect and ability to communicate 
afflicts 4 million americans and is expected to strike millions more 
as the baby boom generation ages 
two percent of the population between the ages of 75 to 85 have 
the disease and 20 pecent of those over 70 are afflicted officials 
say one of three american families is believed to have an 
alzheimers victim 
the disease has received less attention than aids although it 
affects more people said dom ruscio a spokesman for the 
alzheimers association 
in addition to increasing federal research funding the 
legislation adds three new alzheimers research centers to the 12 
already in the united states the bill also would establish state 
programs with education and support services for victims 
pressler said the legislation identical to a bill introduced 
earlier in the house would finance a research program similar to 
the effort we had for polio in the 1950s 
pressler has witnessed the steady decline of his father tony a 
retired south dakota farmer for 14 years 
pressler is reluctant to discuss his 73yearold fathers 
illness but he wrote in a 1982 magazine article that his father did 
not seem to recognize people and cannot talk 
the disease is especially hard on the families because of the 
constant care victims require and the high cost of their care 
it takes a lot of human resources not only the people 
suffering from it but the people caring for that person pressler 
said 
although the government is spending 120 million a year on 
alzheimers research the effort is highly underfunded said sen 
mark hatfield rore who is cosponsoring the legislation

workers at a roman catholic convent on 
the edge of the auschwitz concentration camp punched kicked and 
dragged out an american rabbi and six students who occupied the 
grounds friday to demand the nuns leave 
about 20 people including uniformed and plainclothes police and 
a whitehaired parish priest who would not give his name watched as 
the workers ripped up the demonstrators signs and assaulted them 
rabbi avraham weiss of the hebrew institute of new york said his 
group suffered bruises scrapes bleeding noses and lips their 
clothes were torn and they were forced to leave the convent grounds 
weiss said the nuns watched from a window and did not try to stop 
the workers reporters could see see women inside watching but they 
were not dressed in habits and appeared not to be nuns 
its extraordinary that in auschwitz 50 years later something 
like this could happen said weiss i demand an apology from 
these nuns 
the incident occurred five hours after the men climbed a 7foot 
wrought iron fence and occupied a porch of the convent located in a 
former nazi warehouse on the perimeter of the camp where 4 million 
people died from 1940 to 1945 an estimated 25 million of them jews 
weisss group called the convent a desecration of the jews 
memory and protested the failure of catholic authorities to meet a 
feburary deadline to reolocate it 
the group went to nearby krakow but said they would return sunday 
what occurred today is going to strengthen our resolve all the 
more now said weiss people should understand what peaceful 
nonviolent protest is all about i cannot accept that the nuns 
would be looking through the window and not help us 
the men had planned to occupy the convent until the end of the 
sabbath on saturday night and then stage more demonstrations sunday 
against roman catholic cardinal franciszek macharski of krakow 
under a 1987 geneva declaration signed by 18 roman catholic and 
jewish leaders the cardinal was to transfer the 14 barefoot 
carmelite nuns to an interfaith prayer and education center to be 
built farther from the camp 
the controversy surrounding the convent has become more emotional 
since the deadline for moving the nuns passed on feb 22 
the european director of bnai brith said in june he was 
confident the situation was headed for a resolution based on new 
assurances by macharski 
the cloister founded in 1984 is a few feet from the barbed wire 
fence and guard towers of the death camp the convent lawn with a 
23foot wooden cross in the middle is a former gravel pit where 
political prisoners were gunned down by nazi executioners in 1940 
and 1941 
jews have condemned the presence of the convent at the 
concentration camp as a deeply offensive intrusion of christian 
religious symbols 
in may 300 women from 27 countries held a peaceful protest in 
front of the convent organized by the womens international zionist 
organization 
weiss appealed to the polish government the independent 
solidarity union and the polish people to exert pressure to move the 
convent he said that despite the february deadline it appeared the 
nuns were refurbishing the building and grounds 
our patience has run out said weiss whose hebrew institute 
is in riverdale in the new york city borough of the bronx 
after climbing the convent fence friday the rabbi and his 
students said prayers sang religious songs and donned prayer shawls 
one placard read leave our holy martyrs in peace another 
said dont darken the memory this convent is a desecration of 
the 6 million 
the men knocked on the convent door but the nuns did not emerge 
instead workmen on the second floor doused the group with water 
jeered and told them to leave 
how dare you throw water at a rabbi or any jew here at 
auschwitz shame shame shame on you weiss shouted at the 
smirking workmen 
he spoke english but the workers spoke only polish and his 
efforts to talk with them and other passersby were hindered by the 
lack of an interpreter weiss had announced the protest to western 
reporters some of whom were on hand for the demonstration 
the workers had tried to expel the men earlier but retreated 
after police officers outside the convent gate shouted at them to 
stop 
the police at first said they would take no action unless the 
convent asked 
before 5 pm however the officers moved away and did not 
intervene when the workers approached the men weiss said 
the protest caused anger and resentment among poles who passed 
the convent during the day 
this is our poland what are you doing here one middleage 
woman said to the group 
they should think about palestinian arabs said another man 
piotr wron its a kind of rape because the sisters are innocent 
a village priest came by and said there was an understanding 
between cardinal macharski and jewish groups that the nuns would 
leave but that the sisters had not agreed 
one woman looked at the priest and said arent there more of 
us than them

attackers burst into a meeting of kurdish 
activists and fatally shot the leader of an antiiranian faction and 
two other men police said friday an iranian diplomat was reported 
wounded 
the iranian embassy said thursdays attack was carried out by 
the enemies of iran but it did not elaborate in its statement 
however irans main opposition group the iraqibased mujahedeen 
khalq said the killings were carried out by the iranian government 
to crush the kurdish democratic party of iran 
austrian police said the dead included party leader abdul rahman 
qassemlou 59 
staterun tehran television monitored in cyprus said qassemlou 
had requested a meeting with iranian officials to seek iranian 
amnesty for iraqi kurds who are being forcibly evacuated from their 
homes in northern iraq it also said qassemlou was seeking a 
guarantee of safety for himself 
the iranian embassy said one of the topics of discussion was 
requested immunity for the repentant members of the kurdish 
democratic party of iran 
the mujahedeen khalq said qassemlou has finally fallen victim 
to negotiations with iran which the mujahedeen have condemned 
according to their telex sent to the associated press in nicosia 
cyrus 
qassemlous outlawed wing of the kurdish democratic party has 
been been fighting iran for an independent homeland for iranian 
kurds 
during thursdays attack an iranian diplomat who is also a 
kurd was seriously wounded said werner liebhart a police chief in 
vienna 
the iranian embassy confirmed that iranian officials were at the 
meeting it said earlier meetings had indicated success was near 
neither iranian nor austrian reports cited a motive for the 
attack 
liebhart said the other two killed were qassemlou aide abdullah 
ghaderiazar 37 a kurd who police said had identification papers 
issued by france and iraqiborn fadel mala mahmoud rasoul 38 who 
held austrian citizenship since 1985 
the three who were all shot in the head were living in austria 
as political exiles all members of the antiiranian party wing are 
said to live in exile 
the wounded diplomat was identified as mohamed diafari 
sahraroodi police said he was not yet able to give a detailed 
account of the attack because he had been shot in the mouth 
liebhart said the shooting occurred in the evening inside an 
apartment near viennas center the apartment was made available by 
an unidentified austrian woman he said 
more than four people apparently took part in the meeting 
liebhart told reporters 
two or three men stormed into the apartment and opened fire 
before escaping he said police said the attackers were unknown 
it was not clear how they gained entry since the door was not 
damaged the police official said 
the kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in turkey 
iran and iraq and small enclaves of 500000 each in syria and the 
soviet union 
qassemlou who was educated in france lived there in exile for 
several years 
he fought the iranian government alongside the mujahedeen and 
other opposition groups in the early 1980s however he later 
supported negotiations 
the kurdish democratic party has another wing based in iran 
under iranian sponsorship it is fighting iraq for an independent 
homeland for iraqi kurds 
the iraqi government recently has been accused of forcibly 
evacuating thousands of kurds from their homes razing towns in the 
northern kurdish homeland and resettling kurds in the south of the 
country 
the government says the resettlement is to improve life for the 
impoverished kurds 
a short time before iraq and iran agreed to their ceasefire the 
iraqis dropped poison gas on the kurdish town of halabja killing an 
estimated 4000 civilians the kurds claim thousands more were 
killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last fall

three dozen guns many of them loaded were 
found in april in a search of the plane of thomas root the pilot 
who survived an 800mile flight bullet wound and crashlanding in 
the ocean officials said friday 
in other results of scrutiny of roots activities a north 
carolina official said root was involved in a state investigation 
into possible securities law violations and documents at the 
federal communications commission revealed that he repeatedly failed 
to comply with deadlines and other requirements in cases before the 
commission 
all of the guns were legal under federal law and all but one 
under state law which led to a state misdemeanor charge 
a search of roots cessna 210 at the manassas va airport on 
april 24 by federal and local officials revealed about 35 weapons 
and silencers and ammunition clips including a machine gun that 
had not been registered with virginia said a us customs official 
who consented to an interview on condition that he not be identified 
most of the weapons such as assaultstyle rifles and three 
357caliber magnum pistols were loaded the official said 
in addition the officials found handcuffs and an electrical stun 
gun as well as a fivegallon can of ether a chemical used in the 
refining of cocaine he said 
searchers helped by a drugsniffing dog found no drugs on the 
plane 
during a may 31 interview with root by prince william county 
police and a customs agent by and large he was able to account 
for legal possession of those weapons the bottom line on this with 
the exception of one weapon a machine gun most of these weapons 
were legal and legally registered 
the machine gun had been registered as required by federal law 
with the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms virginia 
authorities charged root with a misdemeanor for failing to register 
the gun with the state he said 
basically he indicated that he was a gun collector the 
official said but there was no indication from root on why he kept 
the weapons on his plane which was registered to a washingtonbased 
company he owns nor why they were loaded 
asked about the ether root told the officials that it was used 
to clean his aircraft but of course thats not what you use to 
clean an aircraft with unless youre going to blow it up the 
official laughed 
officials did not close the case because when you come across 
this many weapons we always continue to take a look to make sure 
no customs laws have been violated 
this is weird to say the least he said 
the official said all the guns were seized and had not yet been 
returned to root by state authorities 
the fbi meanwhile is conducting a preliminary investigation of 
what happened on the plane said spokesman sean lemieux 
its an unusual incident and the fbi has jurisdiction in crimes 
aboard aircraft so the fbi is looking into it to see if there are 
any violations of federal criminal statutes lemieux said 
roots plane crashlanded and he swam to rescuers hollywood 
fla police chief richard witt said root had been shot the bullet 
going through his left rib cage and his colon leaving his body 
then going through his arm 
a powder burn indicated root was shot at close range the chief 
said 
an investigator for the national transportation safety board 
andrew alston was to interview root for the first time on saturday 
said agency spokeswoman rachel halterman 
in north carolina secretary of state rufus edmisten said of 
root our office has spoken to him in regard to a securities 
probe obviously he knew he was under investigation edmisten 
said 
the investigation has been focused on sonrise management 
services and while he is not employed by them he has ties to them 
and has been an integral part of the investigation edmisten said 
sonrise said in a statement issued in georgia that root in no 
way represents the firm the only connection with mr root is 
that he represents certain entities which also number among our 
clientele said the firm 
sms is in the business of helping individuals and other 
associations secure fcc licenses to open and operate radio 
stations edmisten said a very substantial part of their 
business is done in north carolina 
edmisten said root was the attorney for investment partnerships 
formed by sonrise 
sonrise properties was competing with rocky mount nc radio 
station wcec for a new fm station said wcec owner joe warner root 
also was majority owner of radio station wswr in shelby ohio 
on thursday root was flying to rocky mount to meet a client 
nancy mooring who is managing partner of a group that has applied 
for a license to operate an fm radio station here she said 
root was supposed to meet her at rocky mountwilson airport but 
never showed up she said friday 
edmisten said sonshine would form a group of investors and a 
legal entity a partnership of some kind is formed and that 
partnership makes an application to the fcc for a broadcast license 
mr root then becomes the attorney for the partnership or group 
there are some allegations that the way its set up is a way to 
avoid securities laws edmisten said 
sonrise sent out a recent notice to a client listing several 
instances involving root that it said caused us great concern 
and offering to pay the costs if the client opted to select a 
different lawyer 
sonrise said that the fcc has stated that root in at least four 
cases has failed to honor important procedural dates including 
failure to appear for a deposition and flagrant default with regard 
to answering interrogatories 
root failed to appear for a required desposition involving 
timothy fm limited partnership which he represented in a bid to 
obtain a broadcast license in charlottesville va fcc documents 
show 
just 45 minutes before his scheduled appearance under subpoena 
root submitted via facsimile a motion purporting to dismiss 
timothys application for the license which also was being sought 
by mcclenahan broadcasting inc 
fcc administrative law judge joseph chachkin wrote in his order 
dismissing timothys application roots failure to provide 
earlier notice of his intention not to appear for deposition 
requiring mcclenahan to pay the costs of a court reporters cannot 
be condoned 
in washington ms halterman of the national transportation 
safety board said investigators have not come to any conclusions 
and have not ruled out anything at all 
she said the agencys investigators had ordered independent 
tissue examination to check a police and fbi conclusion that root 
suffered a singlebullet gunshot wound blood tests were also being 
taken to check for drugs or carbon monoxide 
in oklahoma city federal aviation administration records showed 
that root has had a private pilots license since 1970 when he was 
17 linda whitfield of the airman and aircraft certification branch 
said his record as a pilot was clean with no incidents accidents

novelist mario vargas llosa returned friday 
from spain to resume his presidential candidacy 23 days after 
quitting the race in a dispute with members of his coalition 
hundreds of supporters waving flags and handkerchiefs greeted him 
with shouts of president mario as he stepped off the plane 
vargas llosa criticized the outdated irresponsible and 
demagogic politics that have characterized peru in recent years 
and that have been rejected by the vast majority of peruvians 
who are to vote for president next spring 
he rode in a motorcade to his seaside home in a lima suburb 
where he spoke to supporters from his balcony 
in this moment the only priority is the salvation of our 
fatherland stopping its fall into impoverishment incompetence and 
selfdestruction vargas llosa told the crowd 
vargas llosa had sent a letter to party leaders in the democratic 
front when he quit the race june 22 saying he was dropping out 
because of petty and mediocre motives of some in the party 
the leaders in the centerright coalition had disagreed over 
whether each party should field its own candidates in novembers 
municipal elections 
vargas llosa said he could not be a candidate for the coalition 
without the united support of the parties he said that support 
would be impossible if the parties had to battle each other in the 
local elections 
the writer resumed his candidacy july 2 after the parties agreed 
to nominate single candidates representing the front in the 
elections which are expected to be a test run for the presidential 
election tentatively scheduled for april 1990 
the democratic front is dominated by vargas llosas liberty 
movement former president fernando belaunde terrys centrist 
popular action party and the conservative popular christian party 
recent polls show the novelist comfortably leading his closest 
rival former socialist lima mayor alfonso barrantes candidate of a 
leftist coalition 
luis alva castro the candidate of the governing centerleft 
aprista party is given little chance of winning because of voter 
discontent with president alan garcias administration 
vargas llosa is basing his campaign on radical neoliberal 
policies to reduce government intervention in the economy and to 
reduce the bloated bureaucracy 
the ideas are popular with business and the middle class whose 
incomes are being ravaged by inflation that reached 1722 percent 
last year and is expected to exceed 6000 percent this year 
peru has stopped payments on its 165 billion foreign debt and 
has been cut off by the international monetary fund and the world 
bank 
the country is also facing a leftist insurgency that has left 
15000 people dead and caused 10 billion in damages according to 
government figures 
vargas llosa often mentioned as a candidate for the nobel prize 
in literature had gone to italy to receive a literary award he 
then traveled to france and spain where he said his ideas for 
dealing with perus problems were widely supported 
but his onagain offagain candidacy has caused some analysts to 
question whether he can take the strain of a long campaign 
quitting once is a tragedy said a democratic front official 
who spoke on condition of anonymity but quitting twice would be a 
comedy

firefighters predicted victory over a big blaze on the scenic 
california coast friday as smaller wildfires burned in central 
arizona and elsewhere in the west 
lightning was expected in a wide swath from idaho to arizona 
bringing the threat of more lightningsparked fires according to 
the federal interagency fire center in boise idaho 
the fires have decreased with the humidity said reed jarvis 
spokesman at the center but the prognosis is for light activity 
due to lightning 
a red flag warning was issued for the eastern slopes of the 
cascade range in washington because of the lightning threat he said 
the largest blaze still out of control was at big sur on the 
northern california coast south of monterrey 
the 6dayold arson blaze had scorched 3000 acres of brush and 
timber but more than 1500 firefighters made headway friday their 
work made easier because winds were light the fire was 70 percent 
contained and crews hoped to get it fully contained by nightfall 
said bill jones spokesman for the california department of forestry 
california gov george deumejian has offered a 50000 reward for 
information on whoever started the fire which has done an estimated 
14 million damage to timber and cost 13 million to fight 
a 3000acre brush fire ignited by tracer rounds at the marines 
camp pendleton was contained friday said a base spokeswoman cpl 
lorna shryock 
in central arizona a lightningsparked timber blaze in prescott 
national forest that was considered contained monday flared up and 
had grown to 700 acres by friday said forest service spokesman 
steve walker about 120 firefighters battled the fire and experts 
didnt know when it would be contained 
in the tonto national forest to the east 250 firefighters 
attacked a sleeper fire that started last weekend and stayed 
small and unnoticed said forest service spokesman jim payne that 
blaze had burned 150 acres of timber by friday he said and it 
has the potential to get much larger 
meanwhile outside silver city nm 565 endangered gila trout 
scooped from streams choked with firegenerated ash adjusted to 
temporary quarters at the mescalero fish hatchery 
theyre swimming said barbara giesecke us fish and 
wildlife service assistant manager of the hatchery they seem to 
be doing fairly good this morning 
the fire which burned 10000 acres of timber and brush northeast 
of silver city was contained monday but the ash continued to 
settle 
the trout will stay at the hatchery until the water level in 
their home creek returns to safe levels and the ash which cuts 
the waters oxygencarrying capacity and raises its alkalinity 
gets clear enough for safety

the bush administration is prepared to announce 
a compensation offer early next week for families of the noniranian 
victims on the iran air flight shot down by a us warship a year 
ago officials said friday 
all but 40 of the 290 people who died were iranian the united 
states has said it would pay compensation to all families but the 
iranian government has refused to provide details about its citizens 
who died such as their ages 
the 40 noniranians were indians pakistanis koreans japanese 
and citizens of several arab countries 
the us government has said it will not pay the iranian 
government directly and iran has called that position not 
acceptable 
in civil lawsuits arising from crash deaths in the united states 
courts generally award compensation based on the lost earnings of a 
family member thus families of people who die early in lucrative 
careers usually win larger awards than families of retired people 
it is not known whether such an approach would be followed in the 
governments compensation offer 
the officials who asked not to be identified were unable to 
provide figures on the compensation package they expect but said a 
formal announcement was expected early next week 
the absence of diplomatic relations broken nine years ago when 
hostages were seized in the us embassy in tehran has complicated 
efforts to arrange payments for the iranian victims 
testifying on the issue earlier this week assistant secretary of 
state john kelly said that the administration hopes to be able to 
resolve the problems concerning compensation for the families of 
iranian victims by working through third countries and 
nongovernmental organizations such as the red cross 
the airbus a300 plane was on a flight from bandar abbas to dubai 
when the uss vincennes mistaking it for a hostile fighter about to 
attack shot it down with a missile 
iran which seeks compensation for the loss of the plane has 
sued the united states in the world court over the incident and 
relatives of some victims have sued the manufacturer of the 
vincennes radar system general electric co

william j stevens ii an exlaw school 
student identified as a suspect in the nations worst unsolved 
serial murder case never seemed to throw anything out except for 
details of his life on the run 
stevens is described by green river task force investigators in a 
court affidavit as a man who collected police badges and old police 
cars and meticulously kept dated gas receipts and maintenance 
records of vehicles he hadnt driven in years 
yet former friends and acquaintances say he rarely discussed much 
of his past in detail 
the task force is investigating the slayings of as many as 48 
women in the pacific northwest between 1982 and 1984 it was seven 
years ago this week that the first green river victim was found 
he was a kind of a shadowy kind of guy i mean he was there 
but he wasnt said kent hansen who met stevens at gonzaga 
university school of law i think we were all trying to figure him 
out because he wasnt your typical law student 
police arrested stevens at his parents home in spokane last 
january on charges of escaping from a seattle workrelease facility 
in 1981 he had been serving time for burglarizing a police 
equipment business in october 1979 
stevens had attended law school for 3 years at the time of his 
rearrest and had twice served as student bar president at gonzaga 
it is his life from 1981 to 1985 when he enrolled at gonzaga 
that the green river task force is interested in police say stevens 
was in the vicinity of several of the green river victims many of 
them prostitutes when they were last seen and that he traveled 
extensively between spokane seattle and the portland ore area 
stevens was the oldest of three adopted children they were 
raised in a threebedroom house in a tidy placid neighborhood of 
singlefamily homes north of the spokane city limits 
stevens mother recently died and his father who declined an 
interview friday recently underwent an operation for a brain tumor 
according to former acquaintances 
billy as stevens was known went to catholic schools and like 
any other child played in the streets with neighbors kids he was 
a heavyset child who kept a collection of police badges in a glass 
case and who later bought used police cars at auctions 
king county capt bob evans in seattle commander of a task force 
investigating the case said that investigators had speculated that 
the killer could be a cop or someone posing as a cop 
stevens would often visit his parents after moving to the seattle 
area to attend the university of washington where he graduated in 
1975 with a degree in psychology that summer he took courses in 
sociology and pharmacology his father owned a spokane pharmacy 
he apparently entered the us army after undergraduate school 
and served as an officer in charge of a military police unit 
acquaintances said he dated but most couldnt recall any serious 
relationships 
sarina caruso 44 of portland ore told investigators stevens 
often went on missions disappearing for days at a time he also 
once showed a secret room behind a bookcase in the basement of a 
home he lived in in portland 
she said she once asked him if he was the green river killer he 
replied dont start that rumor people around here think im 
weird enough 
caruso who described herself as probably the closest thing he 
had to a friend described stevens as bizarre and 
antisocial 
but another woman who knew stevens from gonzaga described him as 
outgoing friendly and who took took more passion in his 
student bar activities than he did to classroom work 
thats his thing he likes working with organizations and 
helping people said the woman a seattlearea attorney who did 
not want to be identified 
dale goodwin a gonzaga university spokesman said stevens was 
dismissed from law school after his rearrest in january for falsely 
stating in his application that he had never been convicted of a 
felony 
goodwin added that gonzaga records indicate stevens graduated 
from the university of washington with a degree in pharmacology and 
that he had also attended washington state university in pullman 
seattle university and central washington university 
washington state university spokesman al ruddy said his school 
had no record of stevens

leaders of the worlds seven richest nations 
treated to the pomp and pageantry of the french bicentennial got 
down to business friday as president bush scored an early victory on 
a contentious trade dispute with japan but failed in efforts to 
speed approval of a mexican debt deal 
bush making his first appearance on the world economic stage 
brought a full agenda of items for discussion with the leaders of 
france britain west germany japan italy and canada 
in his opening remarks at the first session and later at a 
working dinner the president discussed his justcompleted trip to 
poland and hungary and sought agreement from the other countries for 
a coordinated assistance effort to both nations according to 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
the other leaders had their own agendas to present 
french president francois mitterrand who has built a reputation 
as a champion of the developing nations raised their demands that 
the rich industrial countries convene a conference to discuss the 
economic plight of the third world 
mitterrand invited more than two dozen third world leaders to the 
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the french revolution in an 
effort to promote the idea of a conference between the worlds rich 
and poor 
but the united states and britain resisted these overtures 
treasury secretary nicholas brady said a casebycase approach 
was a better way to handle the third world debt burden rather than 
convening a giant international conference 
you dont get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and 
calling them north and south as the rich and poor nations are 
often reffered to brady told reporters 
german chancellor helmut kohl urged his summit partners to adopt 
policies that would allow continued economic growth while reducing 
trade surpluses 
kohl maintaining that air pollution may pose the biggest threat 
to future generations said the environment should be a central 
theme of the summit according to his spokesman hans klein 
fitzwater briefing reporters after the first session ended said 
that there was general agreement on bushs proposals to boost aid to 
poland and hungary although questions remained on the specifics of 
coordinating the assistance 
at dinner bush briefed his summit partners on his trip to poland 
and hungary 
they spoke of objectives the importance of the moment and of 
the latest changes french spokesman hubert vedrine told reporters 
at a postmidnight briefing the leaders also discussed the best 
way to aid these countries and how to act in a way that this aid is 
coherent and useful 
though he declined to go into specifics vedrine said the 
possible role of the international monetary fund the paris club of 
western creditor nations and other organizations was discussed 
the leaders planned to put the finishing touches on their 
political communique at their morning meeting saturday vedrine said 
the document would touch on four subjects human rights eastwest 
relations terrorism and china 
the 15th annual economic summit the third to be held in france 
began with the traditional show of harmony as the leaders posed for 
their class photo using the new glass pyramid of the louvre 
museum as a backdrop 
british prime minister margaret thatcher the dean of summiteers 
with 10 years in office was the first to arrive for the formal 
greeting by mitterrand 
even before the summit opened the united states and japan moved 
to cool trade tensions which flared this year after the 
administration adopted a tough line targeting japan as an unfair 
trader because of barriers to the sale of american goods in japan 
the action brought under the 1988 trade law would allow the 
administration to impose stiff sanctions on japanese products within 
18 months if negotiations failed to remove the barriers 
while the japanese reacted with outrage at being singled out 
both sides adopted a more conciliatory attitude friday after a 
private meeting between bush and japanese prime minister sousuke uno 
the japanese after initially balking at the idea agreed to 
launch negotiations with a oneyear deadline aimed at removing 
barriers to sales of foreign goods such as the japanese distribution 
system 
bush was less successful however at breaking a deadlock between 
negotiators trying to produce a debtreduction plan for mexico the 
president began his day with a hurriedly arranged meeting with 
mexican president carlos on the debt question 
us officials announced later that the administration would be 
willing to extend an emergency loan of between 1 billion and 2 
billion to mexico if the money would help break a deadlock in 
current negotiations between mexico and the commercial banks that 
hold the bulk of its debt 
brady told reporters that the united states would ask other 
summit countries to help with the emergency loan known as a bridge 
loan which a country can use until it can get new money from its 
creditor banks but the bridge financing offer did not immediately 
produce results in the mexican debt talks which remain stalemated 
in new york 
the first session of the big seven industrial countries coincided 
with the climax of three days of festivities marking the july 14 
1789 storming of the bastille 
after an evening spent discussing weighty global issues over 
dinner bush and the other leaders adjourned to a balcony to watch 
the high point of the bicentennial celebration a 15 million parade 
featuring english bagpipers marching in artificial rain and solviet 
skaters dancing with a bear on ice as the crowd was sprayed with 
confetti snow 
earlier in the day bush sat next to president hossain mohammed 
ershad the president of bangladesh one of the poorest nations in 
the world for a morning military parade down the champs elysee a 
seating arrangement undoubtedly inspired by mitterrands desire to 
prompt discussions between rich and poor 
still mitterrand has come under sharp criticism for the 
extravagance in staging the bicentennial events and for having two 
separate dinners friday night for the rich and poor nations 
the summit will devote a portion of saturdays session to talks 
on a global initiative to clean up the environment the first time 
an economic gathering has spent so much time on this topic the 
talks will conclude on sunday with the reading of a final communique 
and separate press conferences by bush and the other leaders

police disclosed friday that 
attorneypilot thomas root had a gunshot wound when he was rescued 
in the bahamas after his amazing 800mile unconscious flight down 
the east coast 
it was unquestionably a gunshot wound said hollywood police 
chief richard witt who added that a powder burn indicated the shot 
was fired at close range and was possibly selfinflicted 
root said the wound wasnt selfinflicted and may have occurred 
on impact when his plane plunged into the atlantic ocean according 
to his brotherinlaw brett geer root who is a gun collector had 
a 32caliber handgun with him in the cockpit geer said 
investigators said there was no evidence that anybody else was in 
the plane 
root 36 remained under heavy sedation at memorial hospital in 
hollywood hospital spokeswoman cynthia wine said he was improving 
and was listed in stable condition 
witt said surgeons had found a wound to roots abdomen and 
determined that a bullet passed through his colon exited struck 
him in the left arm and exited again 
in washington on friday a us customs official said authorities 
found three dozen guns many of them loaded in a search of roots 
plane last april all of the guns were legal under federal law and 
all but one under state law which led to a state misdemeanor charge 
a search of roots plane at the manassas va airport revealed 
about 35 weapons and silencers and ammunition clips including a 
machine gun that had not been registered with virginia said a 
customs official who consented to an interview on condition that he 
not be identified 
most of the weapons such as assaultstyle rifles and three 
357caliber magnum pistols were loaded the official said 
during an interview with prince william county police and a 
customs agent root was able to account for legal possession of 
those weapons the bottom line on this with the exception of one 
weapon a machine gun most of these weapons were legal and legally 
registered 
also friday the fbi moved into the case because of the reported 
gunshot wound spokesman paul miller said and a national 
transportation safety board air safety investigator came to the 
hospital 
other federal investigators scattered to seek information on root 
ranging from his financial situation to his psychological condition 
his physical fitness his flying ability and his guns the ntsb 
investigator said 
with root under sedation and his singleengine cessna believed to 
be at the bottom of bahamian waters more than a mile deep 
authorities turned their attention to multiple phone calls from 
people in several states making various allegations that have not 
been confirmed said andrew alston the ntsb investigator 
he declined to give details but said they came from private 
citizens and government agencies on topics that included roots 
finances and his pilot ability 
there are many questions ill be asking said alston who 
delayed until saturday efforts to interview root were not going 
to try to bother him today 
in north carolina secretary of state rufus edmisten said his 
office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a 
company with which root was involved 
root acted as attorney for partnerships formed by the company 
sonrise management services which helps other organizations secure 
federal communications commission licenses to operate radio 
stations edmisten said there are allegations that the company was 
set up in a way that allowed it to avoid securities laws 
you know these are only allegations he added this is just 
heightened because mr root went down in the big waters 
obviously he knew he was under investigation our office has spoken 
with him 
roots wife kathy 35 planned to visit her husband friday on 
thursday she said she told hospital officials to send her husband 
the message root you really did it this time 
she told reporters thursday night he had suffered a fainting 
spell about two months ago she also said he had often flown private 
planes on business trips 
geer 34 who lives in st petersburg fla said he visited root 
thursday night and again friday when the pilot was sitting up in 
the chair in his hospital room 
one thing he said was did this get on the news last night 
i think thats the understatement of the day said geer 
alston said he hoped to interview roots relatives 
he said the ntsb couldnt confirm there was a gunshot wound but 
said a tissue sample from the burned area blood samples and a 
very very small metal fragment taken from root would be 
analyzed in federal laboratories 
its pretty amazing i agree with that alston said of roots 
journey on autopilot while shadowed by military and coast guard 
planes and his survival and rescue by air force parachute rescuers 
authorities earlier had speculated that root may have had a heart 
attack or inhaled carbon monoxide witt said root could have been 
shot before takeoff but the wound is believed to have occurred in 
the air 
alston said roots radio transmissions with control towers had 
been normal until he began heading past his north carolina 
destination and into a warning area probably a military restricted 
zone root reported that he was having difficulty breathing and 
then radio contact ceased military pilots reported seeing the pilot 
slumped over the controls 
they didnt see anyone else aboard said federal aviation 
administration spokesman fred farrar 
roots odyssey started on a 630 am flight from washington to 
rocky mount nc and ended when his outoffuel plane crashed into 
bahamian waters at 1220 pm alston said there were no plans to try 
to raise the plane 
for nearly four hours military jets shadowed the cessna 210 
centurion as it traveled down the east coast 
after the plane crashed root emerged wearing only pants and 
socks and swam clear of the craft minutes before it sank 
it was a sight to see said air force staff sgt scott tracy 
whose parachute rescue team jumped 3000 feet in 30 seconds to 
rescue root 
alston said the bahamian government has authority over the case 
but has asked the ntsb to run the investigation 
ms wine the hospital spokeswoman said roots family requested 
no information be released on the exact extent of his injuries root 
underwent 90 minutes of exploratory surgery thursday

the dairy that supplied milk used in cheese 
infected with a deadly bacteria was not responsible for the 1985 
disease outbreak that killed 48 people jurors decided friday 
the panel voted 111 that altadena certified dairy could not be 
held liable along with the defunct jalisco mexican products inc of 
artesia for some 100 million in victims claims the jury began 
deliberations monday 
the decision means there could be little compensation for 
victims families and leaves jalisco as the sole defendant 
attorneys for jalisco argued that altadena sold tainted milk to 
the cheese manufacture 
but dairy lawyer raymond novell told the jury that bacteria was 
never found in altadena milk or dairy herds noting altadena 
supplied 26 million gallons of milk to 30 customers during the 
period in question and only jalisco had an outbreak of the severe 
flulike bacterial disease listeriosis 
the bacteria was found in abundance in refrigerators ants and 
even employees at the jalisco plant he told the panel 
juror mary lou matthews of los angeles said she agreed with

states once again friday that pressure to remove him as panamas de 
facto ruler will not succeed 
the rejection was contained in a statement read at a ceremony 
marking the bicentennial of the french revolution 
panama today like france did yesterday is struggling 
stoically against aggression intolerance and lack of 
understanding it said our objectives are sovereignty and 
selfdetermination the right to choose and decide what we want 
when we want it and who we want it with 
we take advantage of this revolutionary celebration to exhort 
all those living in this isthmus to end the fight between brothers

violinist itzhak perlman kicked off this summers 
mostly mozart festival at lincoln center 
he played two violin concerti by mozart and bach on opening 
night with the festivals orchestra and conductor gerard schwarz 
they repeated the program the second night tuesday which was 
televised 
and on wednesday the audience at avery fisher hall heard even 
more of perlman when he and pianist joseph kalichstein played four 
sonatas for violin and piano this third mostly mozart evening was 
entirely mozart and wonderful 
kalichstein often plays chamber music with violinist jaime laredo 
and cellist sharon robinson and is known for playig 19th century 
music 
kalichstein sounded like a mozart specialist on wednesday his 
chords were clean both played with dazzling timing when the two 
instruments held a dialogue or echoed each other the timing was 
perfect 
the beautiful tone and varieties of tone that perlman gets from 
the violin is well known kalichsteins tone also is splendid and he 
wasnt afraid to create enough volume occasionally to swamp the 
violin neither created a thin sound they proved that sound can be 
both lush and appropriately contained 
the sonatas played were g major for which the composer 
played violin at the 1781 premiere d major and e minor from 
1778 and a major from 1787 
while fast passages especially the last movement of the a 
major which mozart composed four years before he died showed the 
two musicians virtuosity most excitingly we most enjoyed the 
andante movements with their beautiful melodies 
and in perlman and kalichstein the mostly mozart festival found 
the men to reach and calm the listeners soul in playing them

rocketing 300 feet skyward in a plastic bubble 
mounted on a flimsy tower of piping is not every world leaders idea 
of a good time 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney reputed to suffer vertigo 
at considerable heights is taking another route to the cloudbound 
confines of the 15th world economic summit at la grande arche 
the sessions on debt development and east bloc aid bring the 
worlds most influential western statesmen to the upper slab of a 
controversial structure that looks much like a deep glassless 
window frame 
the rooftop summit site is a windowless marbleencased concrete 
cocoon that spans two trapezoidal office towers at a height of more 
than 300 feet 
many have likened the arches exposed elevator shaft to 
scaffolding and two stands of metalpipe artworks flanking the 
structures entrance also give the site a men at work motif 
to picture the arche imagine a 35storyhigh white cardboard box 
standing on its side with the top and bottom flaps folded in to 
form a freestanding tunnel 
the cavernous hollow below the summit site is large enough to 
hold the notre dame cathedral including its spire 
mulroneys spokesman gilbert lavoie declined comment on a le 
monde newspaper report friday that the canadian prime minister would 
forego the elevators because of a fear of heights 
lavoie said it was his understanding that all seven leaders 
attending the summit would avoid the bubbles for security reasons 
and that mulroneys attitude toward heights is a matter of his 
private life 
journalists who have accompanied mulroney on other trips abroad 
however report that the prime minister categorically rejects all 
venues with exposed heights and even draws the curtains over windows 
of his jet when flying 
contrary to the canadian view at least one of the leaders is 
taking the scenic route 
i cant imagine george bush passing up anything adventurous 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater commented

the economic summit meeting is being overshadowed by a lavish 
celebration of the 200th anniversary of the storming of the 
bastille a focal point of the french revolution 
but us officials say they are too busy worrying about debt and 
other financial issues to be distracted 
i can only tell you that i am impressed with the quality of the 
discussion and the intentions of the leaders treasury secretary 
nicholas brady said 
the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater also 
disclaimed any distraction from the business at hand despite the 
parades fireworks and extravagent displays 
he said that celebrating bastille day annually was just as 
important to the people of france as the independence day is to the 
people of america 
fitzwater added we respect this and think it adds immensely to

linda leary was president of civic groups and 
donated time to causes to all appearances a welltodo 
communityminded woman 
one son paul heilbrunn was a commodities broker and columnist 
for a local business journal the other richard heilbrunn lived on 
a farm outside town 
but all three now are being held in an austrian jail fighting 
extradition to face charges they ran a marijuanasmuggling ring so 
big that authorities say the people hired to count money were told 
to not bother with 1 bills 
leary and her sons left the united states in 1985 two years 
before their november 1987 indictment they werent arrested until 
may leary was released but rearrested this month after the us 
government protested and attorneys on both sides of the case say 
it could be years before they are tried 
at this point its completely in the hands of the austrian 
government said deputy us attorney john thar obviously i 
would feel better if i were in control but thats just the way it 
is 
thirtyfour people were named in the 136page indictment 
outlining what federal authorities said was one of the largest 
marijuanasmuggling rings ever uncovered it allegedly touched 11 
midwestern states and moved at least 250000 pounds of marijuana 
employees counted as much as 15 million at a time 
the family knew it was under investigation paul heilbrunn had 
testified before a grand jury so it wasnt terribly surprising 
that they fled said us attorney deborah daniels anybody that 
has that much money and knows there is an investigation is a likely 
flight suspect 
daniels and her staff bided their time waiting for officials in 
washington to process hundreds of pages of documents at the justice 
department translate them into german and move them through the 
state department to austria 
the three were first arrested may 24 in austria under the 
international convention of narcotics there is no usaustria 
extradition agreement 
they had no indication they were going to be taken into 
custody said bernard l pylitt an indianapolis attorney 
representing leary i have no idea what the austrian government is 
going to do in this case 
paul heilbrunn who shares a home near salzburg with his wife and 
two children believes if he returns to the united states he will 
not get a fair trial said linda pence his attorney here the 
attitude toward drugs is such that it clouds everyones minds as to 
guilt and innocence 
were very hopeful the austrians will give them their 
release pence said paul did not flee he did not leave that 
country at all he knew an extradition request was pending hes not 
going to flee 
pylitt and pence said they did not know if richard had an 
attorney here 
leary and her sons might have been likely to flee in the eyes of 
federal authorities but to all appearances they were unlikely 
criminals 
leary 58 had been president of the indianapolis league of women 
voters and the local chapter of the national council of jewish 
women she was an outstanding community citizen said robert 
davies a family attorney who was acquitted in march of 
moneylaundering and conspiracy in the case 
she did a lot of things for the community she was in every 
organization davies said she was in leadership positions she 
gave the position of being a welltodo communityspirited person 
paul heilbrunn 35 was a very charming bright guy davies 
added 
however authorities say paul led the ring in partnership with a 
man thar identified as jeffrey b collins an escapee from a florida 
prison richard was one of three lieutenants immediately under the 
two partners thar said leary helped manage money laundered by 
dummy companies in the bahamas and panama 
the indictment says the ring imported at least 140000 pounds of 
pot in 1985 alone storing it on a farm in northern indiana and near 
ann arbor mich when robbers stole 6000 pounds from the farm 
eight employees were given voice stress tests the loss ultimately 
was absorbed by the heilbrunns collins and unindicted 
coconspirators richard i bernstein and charles e stocksdale 
leary faces 12 counts including conspiracy to distribute 
marijuana moneylaundering and interstate transportation in aid of 
racketeering paul faces 26 counts including conspiracy to import 
and distribute marijuana and running a continuing criminal 
enterprise richard 38 faces nine counts 
however they could not be prosecuted on 21 taxrelated charges 
if they are extradited under provisions of the international 
convention of narcotics eight of learys counts are taxrelated as 
are 10 of pauls and three of richards 
were in the waiting process said daniels who nonetheless 
is happy with other results in the drawnout case 
i think weve been real successful weve convicted everyone 
weve gotten our hands on the people whove fled to austria there 
was nothing we could do to stop that and we have every reason to 
believe theyll be extradited

hbo sensing a need for transactional 
immediacy figured to meet the challenge with a 24houraday 
vertical format in a basic cable milieu 
in other words a comedy channel that you dont have to pay extra 
to get 
beginning in november hbos comedy channel will premiere on 
basic cable systems viewers wont have to buy hbo to get it hbo 
executives said they would announce later this month how many cable 
systems will carry it 
the channels format is still sketchy but the plan is that it 
will offer quick bites of standup comedy movie clips stage bits 
and some fulllength films 
hbo which has been bread and butter to a lot of comedians with 
its on location shows and comedy experiment series on 
cinemax has already signed a number of comedians to develop regular 
bits and programs for the new channel they include richard belzer 
rich hall paula poundstone and wil shriner 
hbo will get a head start on mtv which also announced a 24hour 
comedy channel ha tv which is scheduled to premiere early in 1990 
its format too is still in the planning stages but will probably 
more resemble mtv with comedy jocks introducing material 
dick beahrs president of hbos comedy channel explained to a 
group of tv critics meeting here that viewers have demonstrated a 
need for transactional immediacy 
consumers want what they want when they want it he said 
citing the popularity of microwave ovens and vcrs for instance 
beahrs envisions viewers watching a favorite network series 
cable show or movie and suddenly getting a nagging feeling that in 
the motto of the comedy channel there might be something funny 
going on over there zap faster than instant coffee in a 
microwave oven they have switched over to the comedy channel for a 
quick chuckle 
the vertical format he explained just means you only get 
one format such as all news on cnn and all sports on espn 
the advantage of comedy programming he said is that it can be 
tempered to meet the time of day but at no time of day will there 
be any rrated language or subject matter said john newton 
executive vice president in charge of programming for the comedy 
channel this is after all advertisersupported basic cable not 
pay tv where viewers choose to get the material by paying extra each 
month 
there will be no sam kinisons or other comedians who depend on 
working blue said newton in fact he insisted that the comedy 
channel will not be the standup channel 
while there certainly will be some standup comedy we hope to 
be associated with a more human open and relaxed kind of comedy a 
lot of standup is more aggressive almost violent i have the 
microphone im gonna make you laugh newton said 
a promotional tape showed comedians as hosts of regular features 
who talked directly to viewers and sometimes interviewed people on 
the street a la late night with david letterman 
beahrs said at first hbo planned to make the channel about 5050 
short bits and longform programs but cable operators said there 
was too much competition in longform programming now the channel 
will be about 85 percent short bits he said 
as for the comedy clips from movies that hbo wanted to include 
that turned out to be a snap movie studios jumped at the chance to 
promote movie sales and rentals by letting viewers get a teasing 
glimpse of some of the best bits a promotional tape of what the 
comedy channel might look like included for example a snippet of 
steve martin in the man with two brains when a police officer 
pulls him over and gives him the worlds most rigorous drunkdriving 
test

upstaged by political turmoil the first emperor 
of china had a quiet start instead of a gala premiere for its 
filmed reenactments of chinese history and spectacular views of the 
great wall 
however the canadian museum of civilization has been attracting 
a lot of attention since the 40minute documentary opened there july 
4 
theres obviously a disappointment on both our side and on the 
chinese studio side barrie howells the films canadian producer 
said about downplaying the movies promotion 
the 58 million movie in the huge imax format is the first major 
attraction at the cineplus theater of the new canadian museum of 
civilization but its part in the june opening celebration for the 
museum was delayed to avoid controversy regular screenings of the 
film in english and french canadas two official languages began 
july 4 on the theaters 87 by 62foot screen 
in new york the american museum of natural history took the 
movie off its summer schedule because of the situation in china 
basically i feel the film has to be shown howells said in 
an interview i look at it as a joint venture between a lot of 
chinese workers and artists and canadian filmmakers 
the first emperor is the first imax film made in china and 
the first to place the emphasis on dramatic scenes rather than the 
showy travelogs known to visitors to imax theaters in museums and 
special exhibitions it is a coproduction between the national film 
board of canada and chinas xian film studio which approved the 
script 
the documentary tells of qin shihuang who built the great wall 
of china but whose dynasty lasted only three years after his death 
in 210 bc 
in its retelling of the emperors career the film notes that 
books promoting freedom of thought were burned 
the burning of them enraged the intellectuals of the day qin 
also had a solution for them the narration written by chinese 
screenwriter wang ji cheng says he buried 460 of them alive the 
criticism stopped 
the film otherwise is mostly filled with scenery and pageantry 
which works better in the large imax format than the few intimate 
scenes that tend to be stilted on a screen geared to spectacle 
in addition to the great wall the documentary also shows some 
of the terra cotta army of 7000 lifesize statues that qin left in 
his tomb the site was discovered in 1974 by some workers digging a 
well in shaanxi province and the canadians making the first 
emperor were the first foreign crew allowed to film there 
howells said the collaboration of the canadian and chinese crews 
filming from oct 30 to feb 13 was a big project and not an easy 
task he said however that in retrospect those involved will say 
we didnt have any real major problem 
he attributed most of the difficulties to confusion arising from 
translating and interpreting mistakes or simply cultural 
differences 
wed meet every day at the end of the shoot of that day and 
sort out the problems he said 
as for logistics among the props were 3200 weapons 40 chariots 
and some artifacts from the qin dynasty there were 11 studio sets 
including a sevenstory royal palace and 20 locations nine 
canadians and 368 chinese were working on the first emperor at 
the height of production 
the national film board produced the first imax film for 
montreals expo 67 with imax theres a high focus and ultraclear 
picture and sound comes from many directions seats are in curved 
rows and at a steep incline so viewers get a full perspective and 
are made to feel like theyre actually in the motion picture 
the system since has spread to other countries and more than 60 
theaters now exist to show the films made from outer space to the 
deep sea 
although the national film board takes credit for the idea of 
doing a documentary on qin it says the chinese decided that the 
pageantry and spectacle would be best suited to an imax production 
even though the first theater had yet to be built there 
the first chinese imax theater was planned for beijing

syd straw former lead singer for the golden 
palominos has a lot more than music on her mind like dinosaurs 
and ants 
she keeps maps and pictures of dinosaurs around her apartment 
and she wont step on ants because she cant stand the idea of 
harming living creatures in any way 
music is her life but when she picks up a newspaper the science 
section is opened first straw often wonders about extinction and 
erosion what will happen to the world 
she feels the same way about people priding herself on the 
diverse group of musicians she assembled for her debut solo album 
surprise 
i bend over backwards to make sure the people playing for and 
with me are enjoying it and feeling good straw said 
thats probably my maternal instinct i feel like i have to 
sign everything whatever it takes to launch this ship my ship of 
fools 
the cast of dozens include richard thompson ry cooder van dyke 
parks marshall crenshaw dave alvin and michael stipe she had high 
praise for them all citing thompson as a guitar visionary 
parks as making music too beautiful for this world and alvin as 
mr ace guitar 
i feel like i worked with the best i went straight to the 
people i wanted i dont abuse people i think thats why some of 
these incredible people would be willing to have something to do 
with me she said 
a steady band would make life simpler for straw but she 
sacrificed stability to play with the musicians of her liking 
i must have claustrophobia straw remarked i like an open 
window i like an escape route i like to know i can go if i found 
a band that had time to commit to me and me alone that would be a 
tremendous sense of security unfortunately i like to play with 
people who are in demand already 
dinosaurs are not mentioned in surprise but straw draws on a 
wide range of influences singing rock pop and country 
chasing vapor trails his turn to cry is the longawaited 
answer to lesley gores 1960s teen smash judys turn to cry 
sphinx features thompsons guitar playing and the 
happygoluck accordion of matt irving straw recorded almost 
magic cowritten by former bandmate matthew auerbach with a 
103degree fever completely blacking out at one point 
she closes side 1 with stephen fosters traditional ballad hard 
times and side 2 with another slow song her own golden 
dreams 
i like to rock and i like to give the impression of being a 
sensitive soul also she said i thought a lot about the song 
order its not quite accidental that both sides end in a similar 
way i want to leave people thinking 
on crazy american she sings any place i hang my hat is 
someone elses home the lyrics recall her years in new york when 
she depended on the kindness of friends and strangers for shelter 
i didnt live anywhere for years ok ill live in your 
apartment for two weeks oh youre coming back nine days early 
youll be here in 10 minutes fine that is a pretty common 
situation in new york city a lot of people sort of live around like 
that she said 
straw whose parents were both actors grew up in montrose 
calif where she enjoyed playing hideandseek in her neighbors 
yards and sitting on a wall singing neil youngs heart of gold 
she headed for new york after high school taking acting classes 
and managing several walkon appearances on saturday night live 
hearing a local singer perform one night inspired straw to take up 
music herself 
music saved my life it gives me a raison detre she said 
i wouldnt want to be a nonmusical person i am so musical every 
minute of my life i have trouble with people who dont give a damn 
about music usually they dont give a damn about animals either 
her career began to pick up at in late 1985 when she met drummer 
anton fier mastermind of the golden palominos at the bitter end 
nightclub 
id say sparks were flying some kind of friction was in the 
air we kind of took each other and started jousting that night he 
walked me home and said you want to sing on my record i said 
maybe and i did 
she learned quickly to be ready for anything with the palominos 
singing rock country and avantgarde with an everchanging band 
behind her after two albums visions of excess and blast of 
silence straw left the group to start a solo career in 1987

international golf inc profits by 
others mistakes 
slices hooks duffs or sinkers whatever golfers call their 
misdirected shots the sound of balls plopping into water hazards 
is sweet music at the worlds largest distributor of used golf balls 
riding the sports surge in popularity this decade international 
golf scuba divers are expected to retrieve 10 million golf balls 
this year for redistribution everywhere from golfcrazy japan to the 
hills of scotland birthplace of the game 800 years ago 
the number of balls rolling into the plant is five times more 
than the company processed in 1985 and more than all gathered by its 
few competitors says the concerns president jerry gunderson 
when you think of all the golf courses and all the people 
hitting balls into ponds we have no idea how far this could go 
said gunderson 
the company is now straining the limits of its plant and 
directors are discussing a firsttime public stock offering to help 
pay for expansion 
think about it every golfer loses balls and they could have a 
piece of a company that makes money getting them out said 
gunderson theyd say well i lost 100 in balls but maybe ill 
get some of it back 
the recent success of international golf sometimes boggles 
gunderson whose first boyhood job was making 8 cents a ball combing 
water traps in nearby lake worth he later spent 1500 of college 
tuition money from his father on scuba gear and devised a weekend 
circuit to collect balls in jacksonville atlanta and st petersburg 
fraternity brothers seeking a piece of his profits would face a 
unique job interview 
id put them under a freezing cold shower for 10 minutes he 
said not many of them made it 
gunderson returned to his fathers furniture business following 
college but the entrepreneurial urge was too strong through the 
60s and 70s he launched several golfrelated retail enterprises 
each time business foundered he turned to golf ball collecting to 
bail himself out 
the break came last year when merimac investment inc a fort 
worth texasbased venture capital firm started to bankroll the 
company and brought in consultants to overhaul management now 
international golf pays more than 500000 a year for the rights to 
collect balls at about 600 us courses 
meanwhile golf is taking off like a solid tee shot the 
floridabased national golf foundation a trade group says 234 
million people played at least one round of golf last year up from 
151 million in 1980 
more than 320 new courses have opened since 1987 in the united 
states bringing the total to more than 13000 in japan there are 
an estimated 12 million golfers and 1600 courses 
international golf does not release sales figures but gunderson 
said its now a multimilliondollar operation that ships balls 
throughout the united states europe and many countries in asia it 
takes about 35 million balls to break even he said 
the backbone of the company is its 45 divers who earn between 
500 and 1000 a week plunging into the murky and debrisclogged 
water traps broken glass and rubbish are just some of the hazards 
facing divers as they grope along the bottom in silt up to four feet 
deep alligators have also bitten at least two divers 
there is no glamour to this job said diver theron mcbride 
whose flipper was once pulled off by an alligator there is zero 
visibility and ive run into everything down there rakes dump 
trucks golf carts and shopping carts its kind of like catching 
bubbles in the dark 
on a good day a diver can pull up 600 balls they are then 
shipped by truck to the plant 
gundersons modest office is decorated with a few golf posters 
and a sail fish he caught as a teenager the arm rests of his 
swivel chair are torn 
the view is the barb wireringed courtyard where 15 million 
balls are bagged and waiting to go through the assembly line 
first the balls are washed and immersed in chemicals to remove 
algae and barnacles next they are inspected for quality and 
imperfections cuts are surprisingly few due to the highimpact 
surlyn jackets on most new balls 
the highest grade balls are packaged and sold for about half the 
price of manufacturers new balls the lesser quality balls are 
repainted and sent to driving ranges even those with cuts are sent 
to luxury cruise ships to be blasted into the sea from deckside 
driving ranges 
im having a wonderful time said gunderson we were all 
working so hard we never looked up to see how things were going 
then one day i looked at them loading pallets to be shipped to 
europe france england sweden and spain and i thought i used 
to pick up balls with my toes its pretty amazing 
gunderson says his company is still a relatively minor player in 
the 462 millionayear golf ball market but while other companies 
have their eyes on the green international golf is left along to 
scour the ponds 
were not onetoone competitors with the big guys yet said 
gunderson but at least were one of their little headaches

of all the strategic errors people make when they 
invest their money financial advisers say by far the most common 
is to have no strategy at all 
for many individual investors this problem arises not so much 
from ignorance laziness or disorganization but rather from the 
ordinary vagaries of daytoday life 
investments in stocks mutual funds and other securities tend to 
be made at unpredictable intervals say when a lumpsum payment is 
received when a bank time deposit matures or when investors happen 
on some idea that strikes their fancy 
in many cases thats only natural the typical small investors 
savings and investment holdings are put together one piece at a time 
unless they come into some windfall such as an inheritance few 
people are in a position to create a 50000 100000 or 500000 
portfolio with the wave of a checkbook 
granted the experts say but even those investors who have 
accumulated substantial sums in their accounts often sit with a 
patchwork of holdings that fit no overall pattern 
this can leave them in a poor position to pursue their financial 
goals and vulnerable to risks they never intended to take 
most investors buy one stock or bond at a time without 
considering how it will affect the structure of the overall 
portfolio observes john slatter an analyst at the 
clevelandbased brokerage firm of prescott ball amp turben inc 
nearly all investors understand diversification he adds 
nearly all investors believe diversification is worthwhile but 
almost no one does anything about it 
in its weekly publication the outlook standard amp poors corp 
summarized the problem the best way to build an investment 
portfolio is with a wellconceived plan 
a portfolio that is a haphazard mixture of stocks some of 
which have been bought on hunches or tips is unlikely to produce 
satisfactory results over the long term 
slatter who has long experience examining the holdings of 
customers who ask for advice says he sees some common tendencies 
in a typical portfolio there are too many public utilities 
often 40 percent or more in many instances there are too many bank 
stocks and oil stocks 
those seem to be the industries that appeal to the vast 
majority of investors yet there are at least 75 industries to 
choose from some of which have done far better than utilities 
banks or oils 
utility and bank issues may attract or have attracted in the 
past people looking for conservative stocks with relatively high 
yields 
however as sampp points out in the world of the late 1980s 
investors who have a large percentage of their money in such stocks 
may find themselves overexposed to the risks that come with wide 
fluctuations in interest rates 
in the same vein slatter says many people with ties to a large 
company through their jobs their family or their communities wind 
up with a great chunk of their savings in a single stock 
in most cases those investors are unwilling to part with a 
single share even when that one stock makes up 80 percent of the 
portfolio he notes they seem to ignore the fact that any stock 
can go down 
who qualifies as a beginner investor with a need for mapping 
out a diversified strategy it could be someone who has just sold a 
house or business received a bonus or hit the lottery 
or says sampp he or she may equally be someone who wants to 
start a focused investment program after years of dabbling in the 
market

housing and urban development offices across 
the country waited nearly a year to reform a program identified as 
ripe for fraud acting only as reports surfaced of abuse and 
political favoritism at the agency 
followup audits show that most regional offices initially 
ignored recommendations made in a june 1988 audit report the report 
said poor accounting and failure to oversee private closing agents 
hired by hud had cost the agency millions of dollars in potential 
losses in its singlefamily housing program 
the reports were compiled in the past month and obtained by the 
associated press through the freedom of information act they say 
most regional offices initially resisted changing the program before 
finally implemented reforms in the past few months a period 
coinciding with numerous published accounts of mismanagement fraud 
and influencepeddling at hud during the reagan administration 
the june 1988 national audit was based on a series of local 
reviews conducted by huds regional inspectors general they found 
an alarming number of instances in which the private closing agents 
had failed to reimburse hud after selling properties or else sent 
the government the money days weeks and months late costing hud 
millions in interest 
ten such agents are the subject of criminal investigations hud 
officials believe their actions cost the agency about 20 million 
hud secretary jack kemp in one of his first memos to regional 
administrators and field office managers angrily criticized those 
who had failed to implement the suggested reforms 
these problems reflect a failure to meet the departments basic 
management responsibilities and leave us vulnerable to fraud and 
monetary losses kemp said in the june memo i will not tolerate 
this and i expect each of you to take personal responsibility for 
dealing with these issues immediately performance evaluations and 
job security will depend upon on how these reforms are promptly 
implemented and enforced 
a month before kemp wrote his memo huds regional administrator 
in texas sam moseley wrote all of that regions closing agents and 
informed them of new accounting procedures warning that those who 
violated them would be terminated from the program 
the auditors of the fort worth office praised that action but 
noted moseleys action came nearly a year after the initial audit 
found numerous problems with the offices administration of the 
singlefamily housing program 
in the interim according to a followup audit completed late 
last month the agents under his offices jurisdiction continued to 
send the government its money more than six days late on average 
the auditors also uncovered nearly 200000 owed hud from agents who 
had handled sales for the agency but had not sent in the proceeds 
the situation was much the same in denver the site of a hud 
regional office that has figured prominently in the scandal 
of 256 sales files examined by auditors more than half 145 had 
no confirmation that the agents had wired the government its money 
hud has no real assurance that sales proceeds were actually 
sent the auditors said 
one of the denver regions closing agents the auditors said had 
placed hud money in several bank accounts and potentially was 
earning interest that should have been placed in escrow accounts 
the deficiencies discussed were permitted to occur because the 
region failed to set up and follow the proper procedures to 
effectively and efficiently monitor the closing agents the 
auditors said that was the case despite the 1988 report calling for 
a series of new monitoring and accounting controls over the agents 
the followup audit of indianapolis singlefamily property 
program found similar results 63 of 68 cases involved late payments 
to the government more than 250000 of unremitted proceeds had 
gone undetected and one closing agent wrote checks for cash on hud 
accounts 
by failing to improve its internal controls the auditors said 
the indianapolis office unnecessarily increased huds 
vulnerability to losses 
not all the news in the followup reports was bad 
in kansas city auditors found agents were sending huds money in 
on time with only a few delays that were beyond the agents control 
auditors said hud officials in seattle still could do more to 
oversee the closing agents but noted a marked improvement in 
processing 
those offices where problems persist will be hearing from kemp 
again soon 
in the absence of measurable improvements within 90 days you 
will be asked to meet with senior headquarters officials to explain 
why such improvements have not been realized kemp said in his 
recent memo these reforms are essential for us to gain proper 
financial control anything less is not acceptable

less than two weeks after the supreme court upheld missouris 
restrictive abortion law battles have erupted in at least a 
halfdozen states in a preview of the war to be waged next year in 
legislatures across the country 
versions of the missouri law have been introduced in florida and 
michigan and are being drafted in indiana kentucky and minnesota 
in louisiana the supreme court ruling has revived a longdormant 
court battle over a law banning abortion 
antiabortion legislators in at least 25 other states have begun 
planning legislation based on missouris law and abortion has 
suddenly become a major issue in governors races in new jersey and 
virginia 
it is going to be the major issue of 1990 said illinois 
comptroller roland burris a prochoice democrat who is exploring a 
possible run for governor theres no inbetween on this 
the supreme court ruling on july 3 upheld a missouri law that 
banned abortions in public hospitals and stopped public employees 
from counseling women about abortions it also required doctors 
planning to perform abortions to first test any fetus over 20 weeks 
to determine if it could live outside the womb 
many observers expect the supreme court to take up other abortion 
issues in its fall term and possibly to overturn roe vs wade the 
case that legalized abortion nationwide in 1973 
but even if the court goes no further than the missouri case 
webster vs reproductive health services it will have dramatically 
altered the political landscape in almost every state in the country 
we really have to recognize that what webster has done is 
reopen the abortion battle said burke balch the state 
legislative coordinator for the national right to life committee 
of 13 legislatures that may hold further sessions this year 
balch says battles over abortion were likely in seven 
pennsylvania wisconsin ohio texas florida minnesota and 
michigan 
he declined to characterize the prospects for change in those 
states or in most of the other states that likely will reconsider 
abortion laws next year 
however he did say right to life expects its most difficult 
battles in the 13 states that provide financing for abortions for 
poor women especially alaska hawaii maryland north carolina 
washington and oregon the states most likely to enact further 
abortion restrictions are louisiana and missouri he said 
louisiana already has the most restrictive abortion law on the 
books a statute making it a crime to perform an abortion however 
the law has lain dormant since 1976 when a us district court 
judge issued an injunction stopping the state from enforcing it 
the supreme courts ruling encouraged new orleans district 
attorney harry connick to ask a federal court judge to lift the 
injunction his request has enraged abortion rights activists 
louisiana is a major battleground said shirley pedler 
director of the local chapter of the american civil liberties union 
it is the first state to try to criminalize abortion even without 
grounds to do so 
in missouri brthplace of the latest round in the abortion 
struggle gov john ashcroft announced plans the day of the supreme 
court ruling to appoint a task force to explore ways of further 
restricting abortions 
other states are convening committees and beginning political 
dialogue that is intended to reach some sort of consensus on 
abortion 
iowa gov terry branstad said he would ask the legislature for 
restrictions on abortion but wanted to consult with a broad range 
of iowans first in maine house minority leader mary clark 
webster announced formation of a republican committee to study the 
issue 
and in new jersey assembly speaker chuck hardwick said he will 
launch the great debate in september by convening a committee of 
the entire 80member assembly to question witnesses and consider 
bills on abortion 
texas gov bill clements who is against abortion said he 
probably would ask the legislature to consider abortion restrictions 
if another special session is held later this year in florida gov 
bob martinez said he would call a special session of the legislature 
in october to consider abortion bills 
clearly i believe the unborn ought to have more rights than 
they have right now martinez said i dont believe we ought to 
wait until 1990 to deal with a difficult subject its not something 
thats going to go away

stocks or bonds which obviously would bode well for the industry 
john markese research director for the 110000member american 
association of individual investors in chicago said thursday 
a rise in june in merger activity and in fees generated by 
underwriting new issues of stocks and bonds two key indicators of 
wall streets health should lift industry profits compared with 
the first quarter when some firms lost money analysts said 
without a doubt its going to be one of the better quarters for 
the industry said brenda davis mccoy an analyst with painewebber 
inc 
salomon inc parent of salomon bros earlier this week 
announced that its secondquarter earnings would be the companys 
best ever exceeding the 190 million earned in the first quarter of 
1986 
john h gutfreund salomons chairman and chief executive said 
the first half of 1989 for the firm would be only modestly below 
that of firsthalf 1988 when it made 253 million or 168 a 
share on revenue of 304 billion 
earnings forecasts for other firms also are optimistic 40 cents 
to 50 cents a share for merrill lynch amp co compared with 31 cents 
a share in the first quarter 260 a share for morgan stanley group 
inc up from 202 for january to march and about 50 cents a share 
for shearson lehman hutton holdings inc after nine months of losses 
but analysts caution that profit levels arent even close to the 
boom times that preceded the stock market crash and say many of the 
factors that led to thousands of layoffs and retrenchment on wall 
street remain 
you cant just throw up your hands and say weve turned said 
lawrence eckenfelder a securities industry analyst with prudential 
bache securities inc we may still be in a recession three months 
from now on the street 
the expected improved results are being attributed to a steady 
decline in shortterm interest rates that has prompted some 
investors to transfer money from money market funds and bank 
certificates of deposit to investments with higher returns 
generating more trading profit for the firms 
for instance the treasurys oneyear bill had a yield of 810 
percent at the end of june compared with 958 percent at the end of 
march some money market interest rates which fetched over 10 
percent earlier this year recently dipped below 8 percent 
declining interest rates mean investment banks pay less to borrow 
money to finance inventories of fixedincome securities also 
brokerages typically receive much higher commissions on investment 
vehicles other than cds and money markets including retail trades 
higher stock trading volume also means more commission business 
the nyses average daily volume in june was 1803 million the 
highest in a year and thirdhighest in any month since october 1987 
merger and acquisitions and securities underwriting activity both 
jumped in june providing additional fuel to the strong quarter 
statistics show 
the total value of announced acquisitions in june was 377 
billion the secondbest month this year according to securities 
data co which tracks industry data analysts forecast a continued 
rise in merger activity if interest rates stay down 
fees generated from initial public offerings of stock 
considered a sign of companies confidence in whether investors are 
buying stock totaled 163 billion in june up from 261 million 
in april securities data reported 
but the industry isnt in clover yet 
i dont think the public is yet of the psychology or philosophy 
that they are going to miss something big and are ready to jump into 
the stock market said jack barbanel a senior vice president of 
gruntal amp co a midsized manhattan investment firm

the takeover battle for tobaccoretailing giant bat 
industries plc is developing into a usstyle fight underscoring 
the american dominance of the worldwide corporate buyout scene 
the hostile 21 billion offer from an investor group led by 
anglofrench financier sir james goldsmith certainly is 
americansized 
it would be the secondlargest takeover in the world after the 
record 25 billion purchase of usbased rjr nabisco inc by the 
new york investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co earlier this 
year it would be four times the size of the previous biggest 
british bid 
the bidders offer no cash and instead are using an american 
financing technique not readily accepted on this side of the 
atlantic junk bonds 
both sides have lined up us soldiers leading american 
investment bankers in addition many of the battles are expected to 
take place on us soil in american courts and before us 
insurance regulators due to bats ownership of american insurance 
companies 
if youre sitting there as an aggressor trying to figure out 
what the defensive strategy would be you would figure they would 
use american advisers and you would try to cut them off at the pass 
and get the best ones said clive sherling a director of the 
london buyout firm alan patricof associates ltd 
londonbased bat a diversified conglomerate has wideranging 
interests in the united states it owns brown and williamson tobacco 
corp farmers insurance group inc and the saks fifth avenue and 
marshall fields department stores 
fortyone percent of bats pretax profit and 30 percent of its 
revenue came from north america last year 
the bidding group which includes british investor jacob 
rothschild and kerry packer an australian entrepreneur launched 
the bid tuesday through a newly formed company hoylake investments 
plc bat immediately rejected it 
on thursday bat said it dropped a planned 400 million note 
issue which was to have been completed monday it would have been 
one of the biggest eurobond offerings ever by a nonamerican company 
the issue has been withdrawn following the disruption of the 
market for these securities as a result of the hoylake bid bat 
said in a statement 
it said it wanted to protect investors who it said would have 
faced substantial losses because of the hostile and highly 
leveraged nature of the bid 
now that bat is under siege said kevin phillips an analyst 
with the london investment firm kleinwort benson ltd they are 
merely taking a prudent route 
bats shares fell 15 pence or about 24 cents to finish at 862 
pence or 1405 thursday on londons stock exchange the bidding 
groups offering price is 850 pence or 1386 a share 
junk bonds such as the ones the goldsmith group is offering are 
not as widely used or accepted in britain where highdebt ventures 
are less common junk bonds are highyield highrisk securities 
also new to the relatively staid british takeover scene would be 
the breakup of such a large company goldsmith said he wanted to 
unbundle bat by selling its nontobacco interests 
in the bat war the offense has lined up us junk bond pioneers 
drexel burnham lambert inc and bankers trust cos financing pros 
its legal advisers include skadden arps slate meagher and flom a 
us law firm on the takeover forefront 
the defense quickly enlisted goldman sachs and co and shearson 
lehman hutton inc to help lazard brothers and co plot its 
strategy all three are american brokerages 
american investment firms which are particularly aggressive 
have been leaders in developing sophisticated takeover and 
antitakeover techniques 
bats defense likely would be a management buyout said sherling 
im sure that it would be led from the states and therefore by 
having american advisers they would have a more direct line to the 
cash 
of course americans dont have the lock on the takeover market 
both sides armies include powerful british firms bat has sg 
warburg and co the bidders have james capel and co

a federal bankruptcy judge has rejected a 
creditors motion to close the financially troubled chicago 
missouri and western railway 
the motion by citicorp north america and heller financial inc 
was denied thursday on procedural grounds by us bankruptcy court 
judge john d schwartz said daniel murray the courtappointed 
trustee for cmampw 
in their motion the creditors had sought to close the cmampw on 
the grounds that it is continuing to lose money and has no 
reasonable prospects of reorganization 
last friday though murray announced that the new york 
investment firm of wertheim schroder amp co had agreed to buy the 
cmampw for 35 million and assume the loans it had taken from the 
state 
the deal which should be closed in september is going ahead 
murray said thursday 
neal wolf attorney for citicorp and heller said the creditors 
were considering a variety of alternatives in response to 
schwartzs ruling but he would not elaborate 
he did say however that the creditors were opposed to the deal 
with wertheim schroder as it now stands 
schwartz also ruled thursday that the railroad may continue to 
use revenues until aug 31 to pay for operations and that cmampw may 
draw more loans from the illinois development finance authority 
murray said 
wolf said the creditors planned to appeal the latter decision 
cmampw operates along 632 miles of track between kansas city and 
joliet ill and carries amtrak passenger trains between chicago 
and st louis 
the railroad filed for reorganization under federal bankruptcy 
laws in april 1988

everything from handcarved ivory elephant tusks 
to office furniture and even the kitchen sink heads for the auction 
block this weekend as federal regulators liquidate some 20000 items 
seized from failed savings and loan associations 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp is hoping the 
fourday auction which begins saturday will raise some 500000 
proceeds will go back to the fslic in hopes of putting a dent in the 
governments cost of bailing out the defunct institutions a cost 
estimated last year alone at 40 billion 
what you see are the signs of success that turned out to be the 
products of failure auctioneer mark thomas of texarkana texas 
said thursday its continuously surprising 
the auction is the first of four the agency is planning another 
is scheduled for next month in dallas and the third will be in 
september again in houston the fourth one is not yet scheduled 
among the 20000 items are four large wooden elephants two 
about 5 feet tall and two others slightly smaller that at one time 
were kept in an austin savings association office 
bargain hunters this weekend will get to pick from the carcasses 
of 34 sampls 32 from texas and two from oklahoma that were placed 
in receivership last year casualties of the energy and real estate 
collapse earlier in the decade 
bids will be taken on everything from 30 cars and trucks 
including a 1957 bentley to bank safes desks and chairs countless 
calculators and typewriters computer terminals paintings 
sculptures japanese vases a persian rug and the three handcarved 
ivory elephant tusks 
the bentley doesnt run 
of the two kitchen sinks in the inventory one likely will work 
its still in its original box 
this is a sign of the old times and once the cleanup is 
complete hopefully we wont see this again john pace manager of 
receivership activity for the fslic said while surveying the 
houston warehouse crammed with the items up for bid 
on wednesday the fslic said it had received 15 billion from 
asset sales last year about 925 million from sales of nonreal 
estate assets through may the agency which insures thrift 
deposits of up to 100000 had liquidated another 309 million in 
assets and hopes to receive 59 billion in income over the next 
five years 
officials expect several thousand people to participate in the 
bidding in the first couple of hours thursday that the warehouse 
was open for public inspection at least 300 people had signed up 
were trying to outfit an office brian steege who works for 
a houston oil and gas company said as he inspected an executive 
desk set were hurting so were looking for a bargain 
ive bought office equipment at auctions before and come out 
good and bad added ed gorman a wholesale insurance broker 
when you buy it at 5 cents to the dollar you can afford to come 
out bad once in a while weve finished our whole office this way 
but sharon jones who works for a houston estate management 
company was less than impressed 
ninety percent of this is junk she said obsolete is a 
kind word 
pace kindly labeled the polished wood elephants more or less an 
oddity 
he would not speculate on whether they would command a good price 
weve had some people from the republican party call and 
hopefully theyll be interested he said

financial institutions have been charged in a 30 million loan 
fraud and kickback scheme that helped force the closure of the 
institutions us authorities say

and banking institutions have cost the taxpayers of this country 
billions of dollars us attorney anton valukas said at a news 
conference thursday 
in each case in which we have investigated failed or troubled 
financial institutions we found that insider fraud was a component 
of that failure valukas said 
those indicted were john f rosch 51 of glen ellyn former 
president of glen ellyn savings which was placed into receivership 
by the us government in 1985 timothy heuer 29 of dallas former

david 35 of sugarland texas a former associate of reagin 
the eighth person attorney michael pietrzak 40 of glen ellyn

caterpillar inc is returning to it roots in 
the agricultural equipment market with farm implements featuring 
cats trademark rubbertrack system in place of tires 
independently built combines and grain auger trailers equipped 
with the unique caterpillar rubbertrack systems will be available 
next month for the first time 
it signifies a major push by caterpillar into agricultural 
equipment which was the foundation of the peoriabased company 
caterpillar was formed in 1925 when two leading manufacturers of 
agriculture equipment merged and moved to peoria 
we became better known as a manufacturer of construction 
equipment and lost our identity with the agriculture industry in the 
united states said bill reno supervisor of caterpillars 
agriculture section 
but weve maintained a presence with our steeltrack tillage 
tractors and now were going to go after the tillage tractor 
business more aggressively than in the past 
caterpillar signaled its interest in the farm machinery market in 
1987 with the introduction of its challenger 65 farm tractor the 
first farm vehicle to feature the rubberbelted tracks which run 
the length of the machine just as the steel tracks run under many 
caterpillar bulldozers 
although the rubbertrack system is about 20 percent more 
expensive than tirebased tractors reno said the rubbertrack 
system is superior 
the track system provides more even weight distribution on the 
ground meaning there is less soil compaction and better crop 
yields reno said it has much greater traction than flotation 
tires and its more fuel efficient with the rubber tracks it can 
go down approved roads at comparable speeds as tires 
reno said farmers who convert to a track system are more 
productive because they can maneuver in muddy fields when tire 
tractors are mired 
caterpillar spokesman keith butterfield said the companys 
mobil trac system will start showing up in more farm fields 
carrying equipment produced by claas of america inc of columbus 
ind and grain auger trailers built by kinze manufacturing of 
williamsburg iowa 
we are really excited about the product said frank reindl 
claas executive vice president we have a significant head start 
over the rest of the industry before our competition has equal 
technology well be working on phase two 
kinze grain auger trailers fitted with rubber tracks will be 
available at 200 dealers by aug 1 said bill heick company 
marketing coordinator 
claas expects to have combines featuring the rubber tracks ready 
by late august at a handful of dealers in the midwest 
reno said peoriabased caterpillar is negotiating with more than 
a dozen agriculture equipment manufacturers for similar usage of the 
track system under implements that would be used in tandem with 
caterpillars challenger 65 farm tractor which runs on rubber 
tracks 
the company says it has sold 600 challengers since the model 
debuted in 1987 and sales are three years ahead of projections 
its reentry into the agriculture market would pit it against 
deere amp co the freeworlds leading agricultural equipment 
manufacturer based in moline 
ironically caterpillar sold its line of farm combines to deere 
in 1935 when it decided to focus on construction equipment 
the one thing that keeps us all hopping is competitive 
pressure reno said deere will have to respond we watch each 
other and it helps to spur technological advances 
deere spokesman robert coombs said his company bought a 
challenger to study the competition but is not developing a track 
system of its own 
we evaluated the track technology but determined it was not a 
desirable feature for our equipment coombs said were very 
comfortable with the technology weve developed and are using

the united states eager to score an initial victory 
for its strategy to reduce third world debt has offered mexico a 
temporary loan of 1 billion to 2 billion to help it close lengthy 
negotiations with commercial bankers 
white house chief of staff john sununu said today that mexico and 
its commercial lenders have some sticky issues to resolve and that 
no deal was in sight 
the quality of the solution is more important than the 
timetable sununu told reporters a few hours before the economic 
summit of seven major industrial democracies opened here 
mexican officials he said want to get it done correctly 
rather than trying to rush it 
bush held a hastily arranged meeting this morning with mexican 
president carlos salinas de gortari who is attending festivities 
marking the 200th anniversary of the french revolution salinas also 
has met with some other summit leaders 
mexico the test case in the new us approach to the third 
worlds 13 trillion debt problem has been holding closely watched 
discussions with its commercial bankers to try to restructure its 
portfolio of foreign loans 
sununu said mexican and bank negotiators were very close on 
terms for an agreement but that they had been stuck on a few key 
points for almost a week 
sununu confirmed a report in todays editions of the new york 
times that to sweeten the prospective deal the united states has 
offered to make a socalled bridge loan to mexico of 1 billion to 
2 billion 
we are ready to do that if it is what is necessary in order to 
complete the agreement he said 
mexico has received similar us loans in the past to ease its 
financial difficulties until fresh assistance from commerical banks 
became available a bridge loan is considered an inducement for 
bankers to make a deal because the new money allows a debtor nation 
to continue meeting its interest payments on foreign loans 
a little more than half of mexicos total foreign debt is owed to 
commercial bankers many of them american institutions 
the united states would like to wrap a deal as soon as possible 
to show its summit partners that its new approach on the debt drawn 
up by treasury secretary nicholas brady can work 
but sununu emphasized that there is no requirement to leave the 
summit with an agreement and that an artificial deadline might 
hurt the quality of the final agreement 
walking into the meeting with bush salinas gestured to reporters 
that a debt agreement was near afterward bush told his mexican 
counterpart let me know on all this other stuff down the road 
the bushsalinas meeting came as more than two dozen leaders of 
rich and poor nations marked todays 200th anniversary of the french 
revolution getting under way this afternoon was the annual economic 
summit of the worlds seven richest democracies the united states 
britain canada france west germany italy and japan 
the combined events have brought together leaders of some of the 
worlds richest and poorest nations although there were no plans 
for them all to sit down together to thrash out world problems 
smaller meetings were planned however to discuss such pressing 
issues as the foreign debt of the developing nations 
egypt india venezuela and senegal wasted no time thursday in 
asking french president francois mitterrand to call a summit of rich 
and poor nations so they can talk about international economic and 
environmental problems 
brazilian president jose sarney also has pressed his countrys 
case with foreign officials 
brazil and mexico are the developing worlds two biggest debtors 
with combined foreign loans of more than 200 billion 
salinas met thursday with japanese prime minister sousuke uno and 
west german chancellor helmut kohl a day after talks with canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney 
mexico the united states southern neighbor has often led 
efforts to bring an end to the third world debt crisis which dates 
to 1982 when that country was unable to meet its loan payments 
kohl met informally with salinas and sarney to discuss debt 
rescheduling and the german leaders ideas for debt for nature 
swaps according to german government spokesman hans klein under a 
swap arrangement some foreign loans would be forgiven in exchange 
for promises of environmental protection 
at the economic summit uno plans to pledge nearly 40 billion 
for debt relief and environmental aid for developing nations 
according to a foreign ministry official who earlier in the week 
briefed reporters in tokyo on condition of anonymity 
he wants to increase japans recycling of funds program for 
the debtor nations by 35 billion which will include 55 billion 
for the brady plan 
the recycling of money refers to the governments effort to use 
capital from its trade surplus to help poorer nations 
in addition 225 billion will be set aside for projects to 
preserve the environment and study environmental problems

general motors corp has recalled nearly 18 
million of its fullsized and luxury cars because of a problem with 
an automatic cruise control that could hold the throttle partly 
open hampering a drivers effort to slow down 
the automaker took the action thursday after the national highway 
traffic and safety administration last march began a formal 
investigation into the problem which could have led to a 
governmentordered recall 
gm and nhtsa said the problem is not related to socalled 
sudden acceleration which some had alleged was linked to cruise 
control mechanisms 
nineteen models built between 1984 and 1988 are involved in the 
recall 
they include 173 million cars with 5liter gasoline engines and 
about 18000 cars with 43 and 57liter diesel engines with cruise 
control iii systems 
nhtsa said it has received 354 complaints from owners of the 
vehicles including 28 crashes and 13 injuries allegedly resulting 
from the problem gm said it was not aware of any accidents or 
injuries as a result of the problem 
there may be an honest difference of opinion regarding what is 
the potential problem said gm spokesman tom pyden but we are 
cooperating fully with nhtsa and were moving forward to address our 
customer needs 
gm and the agency said the problem stems from a small plastic 
ring which can slip out of place causing the throttle to remain 
partially open while at highway speeds making it difficult for the 
driver to slow down 
owners will be notified by mail and repairs will be performed at 
no cost to the customer 
models included in the recall are 
oldsmobile delta 88 98 regency custom cruiser cutlass supreme 
and toronado 
buick lesabre electra park avenue estate wagon rivera and 
regal 
pontiac bonneville g parisienne and grand prix 
chevrolet caprice and monte carlo

the descendants of the log cabins of the american 
frontier are gaining popularity in asia and europe as well as at 
home 
not the roughhewn logs and mudfloored types of yore though 
these are the modern sleek versions made of precisely cut pieces 
of wood and coming equipped with modern conveniences including 
jacuzzis and saunas 
and the increasing popularity of log homes both at home and 
abroad could pep up north georgias forest products industry said 
donald mahaffey president of fireside log homes in ellijay one of 
14 log home makers in georgia and one of the nations largest 
last year fireside produced 250 log homes ranging in price from 
19600 to 42800 and mahaffey estimates that exports of the log 
homes could make up as much as half of firesides volume by 1992 
according to log home living a magazine that tracks the 
industry 452 american log homes were exported last year including 
390 to japan 
overall the us industrys 466 manufacturers produced about 
14353 homes last year 2533 fewer than in 1987 sales by us 
manufacturers increased to 4134 million in 1988 from 401 million 
in 1987 the magazine said 
mahaffey leaves next week for japan to unveil a 1000squarefoot 
log home that fireside developed especially for the japanese market 
the japanese are fascinated with solidwoodwall 
construction said barbara martin program director of the 
building systems council of the national association of home 
builders in washington dc for one thing wood is very scarce in 
that country apparently its a status symbol 
but mahaffey said many americans still perceive log homes to be 
drafty fire hazards that are susceptible to termites 
the industry is trying to change that image officials say log 
homes because they are built of solid wood are able to retard 
fires better than conventionally built houses and a log homes 
thick walls provide better insulation and thus are more energy 
efficient they say 
many of todays log homes are built from machinemade kits 
although a few are still handcrafted 
but john kupferer editor and publisher of log home living warns 
buyers that all log homes require more maintenance than conventional 
houses in the first two years after construction 
until this whole mass of wood settles and shrinks and 
acclimates itself you need to keep the exterior maintained with a 
preservative and you need to keep the cracks filled otherwise they 
fill with moisture he said 
kupferer said the industry is selling larger houses he noted 
that the domestic loghome market is shifting from firsttime home 
buyers to existing homeowners moving up to larger residences 
in the late 1970s and early 80s we built a lot more houses 
than we do today said dewey taylor sales manager at mountaineer 
log homes inc in baldwin which now produces about 50 homes a year 
most of them custommade there was a tremendous amount of small 
cabins then but we have gone from the secondary home to the primary 
residence 
where the typical mountaineer home once was 800 to 1200 square 
feet it now is 1500 to 5000 square feet taylor said we just 
finished one that is 6700 square feet down in snellville he said 
i like wood i like wood interiors said james edward massey 
68 former president of the first national bank of cobb county he 
owns a 1680squarefoot threebedroom two bath log home on 
walnut mountain near ellijay 
a log home breathes massey said and you get better 
circulation and better and even temperatures in a log home 
according to log home livings latest survey most log home 
owners are middleaged collegeeducated professionals who have at 
least two children about 43 percent have annual incomes of more 
than 40000 some 84 percent use their log homes which average 
1872 square feet as their primary residence

wholesale prices fell 01 percent in june the 
first drop in 18 months driven down by steep declines in energy and 
food prices the government said today 
the slight decline in the labor departments producer price index 
surprised most economists who were expecting a moderate increase of 
03 percent and marked a sharp turnaround from the big 09 percent 
jump in may 
in another report the commerce department said retail sales fell 
04 percent in june their first monthly backtoback drop in more 
than two years as consumer spending remained sluggish 
particularly for cars and other more costly durable goods 
and the federal reserve reported the operating rate for us 
factories fell in june to 835 percent while industrial production 
dropped 02 percent further easing concerns about inflation but 
providing more evidence of a slowing economy 
energy costs which had soared more than 20 percent over the 
first five months of the year fell 31 percent in june the biggest 
drop in three years 
food prices fell 08 percent the steepest in a year and a half 
reversing an identical increase in may 
despite the overall decline economists were likely to read mixed 
signals from the june report because goods other than food and 
energy rose 07 percent the largest increase since october 1986 
because food and energy prices swing widely from month to month 
and are less influenced by the economy as a whole analysts look to 
the inflation rate of other goods as an indicator of underlying 
inflationary pressures in the economy 
despite the drop in the index last month wholesale inflation for 
the first half of 1989 hit a fast 76 percent annual pace nearly 
double last years 4 percent rise 
the labor department said prices of tomatoes and celery which 
had doubled in may fell sharply in june vegetables overall fell 8 
percent last month following a 264 percent rise in may 
other food catagories posting declines in may were pasta 9 
percent fish 73 percent chickens 52 percent and beef and 
veal 38 percent 
prices rose for pork turkey fresh fruit eggs and candy 
energy costs fell across the board with drops of 8 percent for 
fuel oil 4 percent for gasoline and 2 percent for natural gas 
the department said the increase in other categories was driven 
primarily by a 58 percent jump in cigarettes and other tobacco 
products and for ships 
prices for prescription and overthecounter drugs soaps and 
furniture also rose while prices for flatware womens clothing 
jewelry glassware and cosmetics declined 
the overall june decline left the producer price index for 
finished goods one stop short of retail at 1141 meaning that a 
hypothetical selection of goods costing 100 in 1982 would have cost 
11410 last month 10 cents less than in may but 640 more than a 
year ago 
the news from inflation measures earlier in the production 
process was also good the price of intermediate goods fell 02 
percent in june after rising only 01 percent in may while crude 
goods dropped 20 percent following a 09 percent rise an example 
of the three processing stages would be finished bread 
intermediate flour and crude wheat 
most economists believe inflation will continue to moderate over 
the next several months but theyre divided over the longterm 
outlook 
analysts point out that much of the price spurt earlier this year 
was fueled by a onceanddone runup in crude oil prices in the 
spring now that oil has stabilized at the 20abarrel level 
energy prices shouldnt be contributing to inflation for a while 
they believe 
also even though food prices have jumped around a bit this year 
it is clear there will be no repeat of last years drought in most 
of the nations graingrowing regions 
therefore the ppi should remain relatively wellbehaved over 
the next several months predicts economist donald ratajczak of 
georgia state university 
between march 1988 and march of this year the federal reserve 
board fought to curb demand and thus inflation by boosting 
interest rates however the economy has clearly slowed so far this 
year and the fed has permitted interest rates to decline 
early in june and again last week the central bank nudged a key 
interest rate the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans 
down by a quarter of a percentage point 
economist david berson of the federal national mortgage 
association said in advance of todays report that if inflation 
turned out to have moderated last month and if other government 
reports today on retail sales and industrial activity in june 
confirmed the slowing trend fed policymakers might be inclined to 
ease credit another notch before the end of the month 
i think the chances of getting another easing are good but 
just as the fed was cautious in going up theyre going to be 
cautious in coming down berson said

the bush administration has offered mexico a 
temporary loan of 1 billion to 2 billion to help bring to a close 
an agreement with us banks on debt restructuring us officials 
said today 
white house chief of staff john sununu said mexican and bank 
negotiators were very close on terms for an agreement the loan 
is contingent on an accord between the country and its creditors to 
reduce and rearrange 54 billion in existing loans 
however some outstanding issues remain and no deal is in sight 
sununu said 
the quality of the solution is more important than the 
timetable the white house official told reporters a few hours 
before the opening of the economic summit here 
according to sununu mexican officials want to get it done 
correctly rather than trying to rush it 
the new york times reported in todays editions that the united 
states sought to sweeten such a deal between mexico and the banks by 
providing a socalled bridge loan 
we are ready to do that if it is what is necessary in order to 
complete the agreement sununu said in confirming the report 
president bush met this morning with with mexican president 
carlos salinas de gortari the two are attending the 200th 
anniversary celebration of the french revolution 
such loans are sometimes used to assist a country hampered by 
paperwork delays following debtor loan negotiations with foreign 
bank creditors more than half of mexicos total foreign debt is 
owed to commercial banks many of them in the united states 
the mexican government has said it would want to reach such an 
agreement before accepting new loans the united states has 
indicated it would like to wrap up an accord as soon as possible a 
sign to the other summit nations that it has adopted a new approach 
on the debt 
sununu stressed that there is no requirement to leave the 
summit with an agreement and that an artificial deadline might 
hurt the quality of the final agreement

on the chicago board of trade following a federal court ruling 
upholding an exchange order requiring traders to reduce their 
holdings in the july soybean contract 
other grain futures markets showed no clear direction 
two subsidiaries of the italian agribusiness firm ferruzzi 
finanziara spa filed a lawsuit thursday seeking to block the board 
of trades emergency order which ferruzzi claimed was aimed at 
weakening its market position 
ferruzzi has denied it tried to corner the soybean market 
the board of trade said it issued the directive tuesday to ensure 
an orderly expiration of the july contract which goes off the board 
next thursday the exchange said that without the forced liquidation 
of positions there might not have been enough deliverable soybeans 
to satisfy all the july contracts 
us district judge james zagel denied ferruzzis request to 
block the order saying the potential harm to public confidence in 
the board of trade would surpass any monetary loss by ferruzzi 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 391 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to cent lower with july at 256 a bushel oats were 
unchanged to cent higher with july at 148 a bushel soybeans

as if junk bonds werent enough for investors to 
worry about now the spotlight has been turned on yet another 
highrisk highyield security junk commercial paper 
the perils of this form of corporate debt were pointed out 
recently by the collapse of integrated resources inc a real estate 
and investment company that defaulted on 955 million in shortterm 
obligations including its commercial paper 
complicating matters is that integrated resources commercial 
paper was not rated as junk or highrisk until after the companys 
financial problems came to light last month that means investors 
saw their investmentgrade integrated resources commercial paper 
turn into junk in a matter of days 
however most small investors have little to worry about their 
only exposure to commercial paper would be through mutual funds and 
pension funds and the risk to these investments is small experts 
say 
one type of mutual fund moneymarket funds invest in large 
amounts of investmentgrade commercial paper but most are barred by 
federal law from purchasing lowrated commercial paper 
the major mutual fund operators do their own credit analysis 
before they make any investment said michael lipper president of 
lipper analytical services inc which tracks the mutualfund 
industry 
that kind of examination keeps integrated resources paper out of 
the portfolios of most of the largest fund operators including 
fidelity investments the vanguard group inc kemper financial 
companies inc and t rowe price associates inc 
these fund operators said integrated resources never met their 
investment standards despite its acceptable ratings from the credit 
rating agencies 
we wouldnt have even considered it said steven norwitz a 
price vice president it had been in a negative cashflow 
situation for years 
one exception is value line inc a mutual fund operator that 
held integrated resources paper in one of its money market funds 
value line said the investment represented about 38 percent of 
the funds net assets market professionals have placed the amount 
at 22 million to 24 million value line would not reveal the 
figure 
value line said last week that it had bought the paper from the 
fund which eliminated it as a risk to the funds investors 
lipper said he believes other funds had invested in integrated 
resources paper but value line has been the only one to publicly 
acknowledge it 
fidelity vanguard and price among others also said they never 
invest in junk commercial paper for any of their mutual funds 
junk commercial paper is a small subset of the 450 billion 
commercial paper market used by companies to raise cash for 
shortterm needs 
commercial paper with investmentgrade ratings is considered a 
relatively safe investment companies issuing it usually have high 
ratings on all their debt obligations due to their strong financial 
positions 
commercial paper is a form of shortterm corporate iou usually 
not secured by assets though it is supposed to be backed by bank 
lines of credit companies sell the paper to raise money for periods 
ranging from a few days to a few months 
the reasons for issuing commercial paper vary some companies use 
it to tide them over until proceeds from a bond issue arrive others 
use it for working capital or to provide cash until funds from 
regular operations come in 
companies find commercial paper attractive because the interest 
rates they must pay on it usually are lower than bankloan rates 
commercial paper also provides flexibility in the length of the loan 
junk commercial paper by contrast is issued by companies that 
are deep in debt or have low debt ratings for other reasons its 
yield is higher than investmentgrade paper because of the added 
risk to investors 
the safety of the investmentgrade commercial paper market is 
reflected by its history only one issue has defaulted since the 
early 1970s said tom mcquire an executive vice president at 
moodys investors service that issue was manville corp which 
filed for bankruptcycourt protection over asbestosrelated lawsuits 
mcquire said he did not have figures on the number of junkpaper 
issues that have defaulted 
but while the track record of investmentgrade paper is 
excellent the integrated resources case shows it is not a foolproof 
place to put money

in cir and some cash 
according to local press reports atampts stake in olivetti has 
been valued at 12 trillion lire or 925 million 
a spokesman for the de benedetti group couldnt immediately be 
reached 
atampt chairman robert allen is scheduled to address the news 
conference 
the transaction would end a sixyear relationship between de 
benedettis olivetti and the us telecommunications giant but

presence in the de benedetti group

to jointly develop personal computers that work in atampt computer 
networks

housesenate conferees today said they had 
unsnarled a procedural knot that had threatened to stall a 157 
billion taxpayer bailout of savings and loan losses 
after balking thursday night at a senate offer of a comprehensive 
package addressing major differences in house and senate versions of 
the legislation the chief house negotiator rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas agreed today to several of its provisions 
gonzalez chairman of the house banking committee reviewed a 
broad outline of the senate proposal overnight today he said the 
two sides are so close on an overwhelming majority of issues 
that he will draft a counterproposal on behalf of the house 
my intention is to provide a starting point for an overall 
settlement he told the five senate negotiators i believe this 
provides the basis for us to resolve the impasse 
but gonzalez and sen donald riegle dmich the senates chief 
negotiator as chairman of its banking committee acknowledged that 
the two sides remain far apart on one issue how to finance the 
bailout 
nonetheless both expressed optimism today that enough of an 
agreement could be reached by the middle of next week to have a bill 
ready for president bushs signature in august 
to minimize the bailouts impact on the federal deficit the 
senate and the white house want to raise the 50 billion immediately 
needed to close some 500 insolvent sampls and cover the losses of 
their depositors through private 30year bonds 
citing potential interest savings totaling 45 billion over 30 
years the house has demanded that the money be borrowed directly 
through the treasury a move that would swell the deficit by a total 
of 44 billion in fiscal 1989 1990 and 1991 
that will remain the key outstanding issue to be debated 
said sen jake garn of utah the ranking senate republican conferee 
in the meantime garn agreed to proceed with negotiations today 
on how much new capital the government should require sampl owners to 
invest in their businesses as a buffer against future losses of 
federally insured deposits 
were not very far apart he said 
gonzalez said he was prepared to accept several provisions in the 
senate bill that impose tougher regulatory requirements on some sampl 
operations and he was willing offer compromises on others 
earlier he had described the senates offer as aggravating 
and a horrendous injustice to a previous agreement to consider 
hundreds of differences between the two bills item by item 
sen john heinz rpa said that stepbystep approach would 
take until christmas to get a bill acceptable to both the house 
and the senate as well as the administration 
its to the advantage of all concerned to open the deck and put 
all 52 cards on the table face up heinz said 
treasury secretary nicholas brady issued a statement from paris 
saying the administration would strongly support the senate 
offer but wanted to review its details administration officials 
meanwhile worked furiously behind the scenes thursday night to 
prevent votes on specific issues 
the dispute brought to the surface major procedural differences 
in the way the house and the senate have addressed the sampl crisis 
and the bailout the largest in history with an estimated cost of 
1000 to 1500 per taxpayer 
both gonzalez and riegle are new to their respective banking 
committee chairmanships 
riegles 21member senate committee met behind closed doors last 
spring negotiating compromises on most issues including several 
provisions to benefit specific companies before voting on it in 
public as a package 
gonzalez had his 51member panel put the house version together 
entirely in open sessions 
he called the senate offer thursday an attempt to avoid taking 
stands on specific items in the package that might offend industry 
and other constituencies 
for the first time there is a spotlight on them everybody is 
watching and theyre not used to that gonzalez said theyre 
used to getting behind closed doors and cutting deals but thats 
where all the mischief has been 
among other key elements of the senate offer are 
acceptance of the houses plan to require sampl owners to risk 3 
in real tangible capital for every 100 in lending by jan 1 1995 
the senate bill had provided a laxer standard of 150 
a compromise limiting sampl ownership of junk bonds to 6 percent 
of their assets the house had wanted to require sampls to sell their 
junk bonds within two years while the senate bill has a more 
liberal junk bond limit of 11 percent of assets 
adoption of a senate clause guaranteeing federal home loan bank 
board chairman m danny wall the right to keep his job for the next 
two years and retain his authority over statechartered sampls

chrysler credit corp employees violated 
state law by repossessing up to 1300 cars and trucks without giving 
owners adequate warning that they missed their payments a lawsuit 
contends 
the classaction lawsuit filed by the state consumer advocate 
charges that chrysler credit corp employees ignored a state law 
that requires written notice explaining to a car or truck owner that 
he has a 20day grace period to make good on a missed payment before 
the vehicle is repossessed 
vehicles were sometimes repossessed with little more than a 
telephone call to warn owners that they missed payments state 
consumer advocate steve hamm said in his suit filed thursday in 
richland county circuit court 
the suit also alleges that employees of the detroitbased finance 
company deliberately flouted the consumerprotection law and 
sometimes faked office records to make it appear that they had not 
hamm said it appeared that the consumerprotection law was 
skirted so employees could cut down on paperwork 
chrysler credit is investigating the allegations and will 
cooperate a spokesman said 
chrysler spokesman bob heath said the company contacted hamms 
office after an employee in south carolina complained in may about 
the way some repossessions were being handled 
the lawsuit asks that a judge forbid chrysler credits south 
carolina employees from continuing to break the consumerprotection 
law even though heath said the company has stopped the violations 
the lawsuit also seeks some kind of adjustment for the owners 
of the 1200 to 1300 vehicles that hamm claims were illegally 
repossessed over the last five or six years hamm said he did not 
know what form the adjustment would take 
chrysler credit will do whatever we have to do to try to reach 
a fair and equitable settlement heath said 
chrysler credit has offices in richland greenville and 
charleston counties but hamm and heath said the problems were 
centered in the columbia office

the united states is lifting its punitive 100 
percent tariff on bonein hams from the 12 european economic 
community nations because they have allowed the shipment of some 
us meat not treated with hormones us trade representative carla 
hills said friday 
the amount involved is small the europeans have been shipping 
only about 300000 worth of the hams annually but it is an easing 
of a conflict between the united states and the community over 
hormones in meat 
the move followed the acceptance by the community of a small 
quantity of veal offals variety meats from the united states 
we continue to believe that the ecs ban on meat produced with 
hormones is entirely unjustified ms hills said in a statement 
the community banned from jan 1 the sale of meat from animals 
treated with hormones to fatten them in retaliation the reagan 
administration imposed an extra 100 percent tariff on european 
shipments to the united states of products with a value roughly 
equivalent to the us meat exports halted by the ban one of the 
products was bonein ham 
a joint europeanamerican task force agreed in may on shipping 
us meat not treated with hormones and to reduce us retaliation 
to the extent that american meat could be sold

in april and 01 percent in march 
it was the first consecutive monthly decline since 1987 when 
sales fell 08 percent in september and 09 percent in october 
retail spending accounts for about onethird of economic activity 
and is closely watched as a measure of the overall economy economic 
growth has been slowing recently prompting concern that federal 
reserve efforts to contain inflation could move the economy into a 
recession instead of the softlanding it seeks 
spending on durable goods big ticket items such as cars and 
home appliances that are expected to last more than three years 
has been particularly affected by the feds credittightening 
measures 
the commerce department said durable goods sales were off 13 
percent in june after falling 05 percent in may and rising 18 
percent in april

an italian agribusiness firm said today it will go 
to court to recover losses resulting from an order by the chicago 
board of trade forcing soybean traders from holding positions 
potentially large enough to corner the market 
raul gardini chairman of ferruzzi finanzaria spa made the 
announcement in milan he reiterated the companys position that the 
accumulation of soybean contracts was legal adding ferruzzi and 
all major world traders are convinced that the board made a mistake 
and has to suffer the consequences 
ferruzzi didnt specify the amount of losses suffered as a result 
of the boards order 
but it said damages could be calculated in part as the difference 
between the closing market price of 726 a bushel on tuesday when 
the cbot issued its order and the price during the days through 
july 20 when all soybean traders must reduce their holdings to a 
maximum 1 million bushels 
a spokesman said the suit probably would be filed in chicago but 
did not give a timetable the company also indicated it might seek 
compensation for unrealized profits as well as damage to its 
reputation 
one day earlier a federal judge denied a request by two ferruzzi 
subsidiaries ferruzzi trading international sa and ferruzzi usa 
inc for a restraining order and a permanent injunction ending the 
bots directive 
published reports have said the ferruzzi was the object of the 
directive 
us district judge james zagel on thursday denied the injunction 
request saying the harm to public confidence in the board of trade 
from the injunction would surpass any monetary loss by ferruzzi 
if i grant a temporary restraining order in this case and it 
turns out to be a mistake then a possible default in the market 
a loss of confidence in the market could be a consequence zagel 
said 
cbot karsten mahlmann said zagels decision reaffirms that the 
board of trade has the authority to ensure the orderliness of the 
market and to effect the orderly liquidation of the july soybean 
contract 
soybean futures prices fell in early trading today in reaction to 
zagels ruling the july contract opened at 690 a bushel 7 cents 
below thursdays settlement price 
on tuesday the board of trade the worlds largest market for 
grain and soybean futures issued an emergency order requiring any 
player holding obligations to receive or deliver more than 3 million 
bushels of soybeans for july delivery to reduce those holdings to 1 
million bushels by the end of trading next thursday when the july 
contract expires 
in issuing the order the exchange cited federal regulations that 
allow it to take such action to ensure the orderly expiration of a 
futures contract 
ferruzzis lawsuit claimed it had been irreparably injured by the 
order which it said would diminish confidence in the market and 
hurt us farmers 
in arguments before zagel ferruzzi lawyer james fox said the 
board of trade acted arbitrarily and capriciously and in bad 
faith when it issued the order 
fox noted that the exchange ignored the fact that the market has 
been trading in a very narrow range in recent weeks an indication 
that there was no squeeze or cornering of the market 
john e angle an attorney for the cbot argued that there is 
absolutely nothing in the record to show this action resulted from 
bad faith tantamount to fraud on the part of the cbot 
angle said ferruzzi could appeal the emergency order to the 
commodity futures trading commission which regulates the cbot 
although he refused to grant an injunction zagel said the cbots 
action may not have been totally defensible he said ferruzzi could 
sue and be adequately compensated for any loss in monetary damages 
if it proves its case 
fox said he did not know whether the italian firm would pursue 
the lawsuit or seek monetary damages zagel told attorneys for the 
cbot to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit by tuesday with a 
response due july 24 
during the hearing before zagel fox said the emergency order 
forced the italian firm to reduce its holdings of july soybean 
contracts by 20 percent on wednesday and another 20 percent thursday 
in related developments the american soybean association called 
for an investigation of the board of trades directive and the 
minnesota agriculture commissioner asked the fbi to check whether 
board of trade officials may have benefited from the effects of the 
order 
soybean futures gained thursday on news that ferruzzi had 
requested the restraining order with the july contract closing up 
10 cents at 696 a bushel the market closed at 726 a bushel 
tuesday before the cbot liquidation order took effect

the hostile 21 billion bid for bat industries plc 
has pulled londons stock market out of its recent doldrums by 
sparking speculation about which companies might be the next targets 
of takeovers 
share prices have jumped to postcrash highs and trading volume 
has soared on the london stock exchange as investors have scrambled 
to place their bets 
youve got bid fever said jeffrey thompson chief equity 
strategist at the london investment firm barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
the market is sizing up every possible target however remote and 
taking it higher 
but analysts said the euphoria could be shortlived 
still the activity was raising hopes that business in general 
would pick up in the city of london the financial district 
bringing in more fees and commissions investment firms have been 
feeling the squeeze since the october 1987 stock market crash and 
following the socalled big bang deregulation of britains financial 
markets nearly three years ago 
no one however was saying that this sudden takeover speculation 
was going to be the citys cureall 
all the stockbroking houses have tremendous cost problems its 
going to take more of a surge than weve seen to overcome them 
said an analyst who did not want to be identified 
competition is pretty fierce she said you will have to 
have some people drop out 
martin hughes a banking analyst with the london investment firm 
laing and cruickshank said the excitement delays a cleanout of 
the city 
on friday the financial timesstock exchange 100share index 
gained 157 points or 07 percent to finish at 22737 a 
postcrash high the index has risen 785 points or 36 percent 
since the market closed on monday the day before the bid for bat 
industries was announced 
volume amounted to a healthy 7718 million shares on friday by 
comparison junes average daily volume was 410 million shares 
the hostile bid for the diversified british conglomerate was made 
by an investment group made up of anglofrench financier sir james 
goldsmith british merchant banker jacob rothschild and australian 
entrepreneur kerry packer they want to break up bat and sell off 
its nontobacco interests financial services retailing and paper 
suddenly anything was possible on this side of the atlantic and 
the city buzzed with names of other potential targets 
they included 
cadbury schweppes plc the confectionery and soft drinks group 
trafalgar house plc a shipping group 
alliedlyons plc the liquor company 
hotel operator trusthouse forte plc 
sears plc a retailer not related to the similarly named us 
company 
grand metropolitan plc a liquor foods and retailing company 
londons market has been languishing since the stock market 
crash plagued by weak prices and low trading volume it has not 
recovered from the crash as well as the other major markets 
british and foreign investment firms which had geared up so 
eagerly for big bang have found it extremely difficult to make 
profits commissions have declined because of the larger number of 
players vying for shrinking business 
firms have withdrawn from certain activities like making markets 
in stocks and bonds which had been opened up to them under big 
bang they also have sought to cut their costs by cutting back staff 
and salaries 
thompson said that despite the pickup in recent activity we 
retain our cautious stance on the market 
the nature of bid activity is that once that the action and the 
excitement is out of the way the market tends to sag back he 
said certain stocks are vulnerable in the shorterterm unless 
another megabid appears in the next few weeks to keep the momentum 
going 
the strategist added that profittaking could accelerate a 
development that could depress prices

grain and soybean futures prices closed moderately 
higher friday on the chicago board of trade on bullish weather 
forecasts and indications of soviet purchases of south american 
soybean meal 
soybean traders shifted their attention back to supplyanddemand 
factors after focusing for several days on an exchange order 
requiring traders to reduce their holdings in the july soybean 
contract 
soybean prices had fallen in early trading following a federal 
court ruling upholding the exchanges emergency order which was 
issued tuesday 
two subsidiaries of the italian agribusiness firm ferruzzi 
finanziara spa were denied their request for an injunction blocking 
the board of trades order which ferruzzi claimed was aimed at 
weakening its market position 
by closing time analysts said the market was reacting more to 
forecasts for warmer temperatures and perhaps less rain than farmers 
need in the corn belt 
overall the market acted pretty well today and i think the 
weather was more of a factor said victor lespinasse a trader 
with dean witter reynolds inc 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 4 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in july at 395 a bushel corn was cent 
to 3 cents higher with july at 259 a bushel oats were 1 cents 
to 2 cents higher with july at 150 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent

massachusetts bonds from aa to a represents a harsh assessment of 
the fiscal policies of gov michael s dukakis and the state 
legislature 
the states economy remains strong while debt and fiscal 
management display serious weaknesses the agency said 
the low state general obligation rating reflects sampps 
continuing concern about the willingness of the state to adhere to 
sound fiscal practices and timely financial decision making it 
added 
calls made to dukakis office were not immediately returned 
friday and a spokesman for state administration and finance 
secretary edward lashman said there would be no comment 
standard amp poors ratings are a measure of the risk associated 
with buying the states bonds the lower the rating the higher the 
interest rate the state must offer investors to entice them to buy 
massachusetts bonds 
the state treasurers office estimates that the latest downgrade 
will cost the commonwealth about 2 million in interest payments 
over the next 12 months but the combined cost of all the downgrades 
this year will be at least 20 million said deputy state treasurer 
cathy sheppard 
massachusetts ended its last fiscal year on june 30 with a 
deficit and unpaid medicaid bills expected to total between 450 
million and 500 million 
saying it was the worst thing ive ever had to do in my 
political career dukakis on thursday announced 491 million in 
cuts from the states current budget at the same time the 
legislature voted to raise the state income tax by 15 percent for 18 
months to cover the deficit from the past fiscal year and pay old 
medicaid bills 
standard amp poors said it was assessing the viability of the 
governors budget package but was uncertain of the legislatures 
response democratic leaders in the state house of representatives 
have said they will move to override the governors veto of 210 
million in state aid to cities and towns 
with a number of issues still unresolved such as the amount of 
local aid and the tax package sampp again observes a lack of timely 
financial decision making the agency said 
sampp had previously downgraded massachusetts bonds from aa to 
aain early june moodys investor services another major bond 
rating agency also cut its rating last month 
sampps downgrading applies to 48 billion of massachusetts 
general obligation bonds and 14 billion in bonds issued by various 
state agencies in addition 757 million of general obligation 
notes and 710 million of various agencies notes were lowered from 
sp1 to sp1

its oil production as much as previously indicated was the only 
disturbing factor for oil traders oconnell said 
otherwise he said prices may have sagged in the absence of many 
traders willing to support them with new buying before the weekend

trading opportunities given the markets love affair with 
numbers

texas oil magnate t boone pickens said friday 
the best thing congress can do to promote the us natural gas 
industry is to keep its hands off 
energy policy to some is for congress to give a tariff on 
imported oil this i am against that is not an energy policy 
pickens told a conference on natural gas 
my message to our leaders in washington is this thanks for 
decontrol of natural gas now leave the industry alone we can take 
care of ourselves he said 
pickens spoke at a twoday symposium on natural gas at the 
university of southern california that ended friday the conference 
drew legislators environmentalists scientists and energy industry 
experts 
pickens founder and chief executive officer of mesa petroleum 
co said demand for gas is lagging far behind available supply 
making it a bargain alternative to oilbased fuels 
thats good news for energy security and the environment 
thats not good news for the producers like me he said 
pickens said the price of natural gas would have to double from 
current levels to be as costly as oil but oversupply has put a stop 
to exploratory drilling he said 
mesa based in amarillo texas bolstered its natural gas 
investment before the petroleum market began to sour in 1986 since 
1985 mesa has doubled its natural gas reserve base to an estimated 
285 trillion cubic feet pickens said 
texas railroad commissioner john sharp said californias market 
potential could pull the texas petroleum industry out of a slump 
he said projects in california could bring texas more than 3 
billion in sales revenue in the next five years 
were in a downturn because of the oil crash but we believe 
natural gas is going to become our golden goose sharp said 
sharp said he california assembly speaker willie l brown jr 
and rep joseph kennedy dmass had agreed to form a panel to 
consult with state legislators nationwide to draft a national clean 
air plan relying on natural gas

fixedrate mortgages dropped to the lowest 
point in more than two years this week and in response the veterans 
affairs department said friday it is lowering the interest rate cap 
for vabacked mortgages to 95 percent 
fixedrate 30year mortgages averaged 982 percent this week 
down from 1003 percent last week according to the federal home 
loan mortgage corp known as freddie mac 
the governmentcreated company which finances the housing market 
by purchasing mortgages said it was the lowest weekly average since 
the week ending april 10 1987 
oneyear adjustablerate mortgages fell to 873 percent this 
week down from 885 percent a week earlier 
freddie mac averages do not include special addon fees known as 
points 
the va said it was making the change in its rate which will take 
effect monday to reflect the recent interest rate decline in 
financial markets as a service to veterans the va insures 
lowdownpayment mortgages offered by private lenders and it sets a 
maximum rate to ensure that veterans are not paying more than rates 
on privately insured mortgages 
the change brings the va rate to the lowest level in 16 months 
the last change in the rate occurred june 5 when it went dropped to 
10 percent from 105 percent where it had been fixed since dec 19 
this is certainly good news for the veteran who plans to 
purchase a home in the months ahead va secretary edward j 
derwinski said in a statement for many veterans it means they 
may be able to buy homes that were beyond their means previously 
also effective monday the va will decrease other maximum rates 
by half a percentage point including graduated payment mortgages 
to 975 percent home improvement loans to 12 percent and mobile 
lot and home loans to 115 percent 
economist lyle gramley of the mortgage bankers association 
predicted that fixedrate mortgages would fall by another quarter to 
half percentage point by the end of the year 
thats not a large decline but every little bit helps the 
housing market he said 
housing has been one of the softest sectors in the economy this 
year because the federal reserve board until recently has been 
nudging interest rates higher to curb inflation pressures since 
early june the fed has reversed course pushing shortterm rates 
down by a half a percentage point 
gramley said he expected a further loosening in shortterm rates 
from the fed of a quarter to a half percentage point by the end of 
the month but that would not necessarily translate into a drop in 
adjustablerate mortgages 
more and more the sampls that were offering extremely attractive 
firstyear teaser rates are no longer doing so because the federal 
presence in that industry is discouraging that he said 
meanwhile the federal home loan bank board which does include 
points in its averages said friday that fixedrate mortgages 
averaged 1100 percent in early june down from 1149 percent in 
early may it was the lowest since the rates averaged 1087 percent 
in december 
the most popular type of adjustablerate mortgage the type with 
caps on how high the rate can rise averaged 1005 percent in early 
june down from 1028 percent in may it was the first drop since 
october

gold futures prices tumbled more than 6 an ounce friday on new 
yorks commmodity exchange on expectations that investment demand 
for the metal will fall following government reports indicating an 
economic slowdown 
on other markets orange juice futures plunged grains and 
soybeans were higher energy futures were mixed and livestock and 
meat futures were mixed 
gold settled 610 to 640 lower with the contract for delivery 
in august at 37220 a troy ounce silver was 08 cent to 15 cents 
higher with july at 5207 a troy ounce 
analysts attributed golds retreat mainly to the labor 
departments report of a 01 percent decline in wholesale prices in 
june the market had been expecting the report to show an increase 
of 01 percent to 03 percent 
the commerce departments report of a 04 percent drop in retail 
sales last month making for the first backtoback drop in more 
than two years was also discouraging to gold traders 
but the federal reserves report of slowing industrial production 
and factory use sent a mixed message to the inflationsensitive gold 
market suggesting both a reduction in inflationary pressures 
which is bearish for gold and the possibility that the fed will 
continue to ease up on interest rates which is bullish for gold 
the economic reports were not all that bearish said fred 
demler metals economist with drexel burnham lambert inc in new 
york 
demler pointed out that gold prices had risen by about 20 an 
ounce since early june and said that when the wholesaleprices 
report came out friday morning traders saw it as an opportunity 
to take profits 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures fell the permitted 
5centsapound daily limit on the new york cotton exchange and the 
soontoexpire july contract which has no limit plunged 63 cents 
to settle at 17135 a pound 
analysts linked the sharp drop to rumors that a large florida 
processor planned to cut prices due to a large brazilian orange crop 
grain and soybean futures prices finished moderately higher on 
the chicago board of trade on bullish weather forecasts and 
indications of soviet purchases of south american soybean meal 
soybean traders shifted their attention back to supplyanddemand 
factors after focusing for two days on wrangling between the 
exchange and a large italian company over the exchanges demand that 
traders reduce their holdings in the july soybean contract 
soybean prices had fallen in early trading friday following a 
federal court ruling thursday evening that upheld the exchanges 
order 
two subsidiaries of the italian agribusiness firm ferruzzi 
finanziara spa had sought a court order blocking the directive 
which ferruzzi claimed was aimed at weakening its market position 
wheat settled 1 cent to 4 cents higher with july at 395 a 
bushel corn was cent to 3 cents higher with july at 259 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents higher across the board with july at 
150 a bushel soybeans were 6 cents to 13 cents higher with july

unleaded gasoline was 02 cent to 62 cent lower with august at

cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the chicago mercantile 
exchange as late profittaking erased earlier gains linked to 
stronger cash markets pork futures were mostly higher boosted by 
strong cash markets 
live cattle settled 17 cent lower to 50 cent higher with august

a retired navy engineer friday admitted 
taking 475000 in bribes from two major defense contractors as he 
and four other people pleaded guilty in the widening pentagon 
procurement fraud probe 
garland l tomlin jr 59 admitted taking 400000 from sperry 
corp and 75000 from honeywell inc in exchange for confidential 
bid information about a multimilliondollar contract to maintain the 
electronic components of navy weapons 
the money was paid between 1982 and 1984 into a bank account that 
tomlin kept in the bahamas in the name of a dummy corporation he set 
up to receive the funds tomlin later transferred 400000 to a 
swiss bank according to court papers filed in us district court 
another former navy engineer jerry l manning 52 pleaded 
guilty to a bribery conspiracy charge admitting that he gave a 
defense consultant bid information about a 20 million navy 
electronics contract 
in addition two defense consultants and a former marketing 
manager for unisys corp the successor to sperry corp pleaded 
guilty to separate charges relating to a scheme to conceal illegal 
campaign contributions to several congressmen including rep les 
aspin dwisc chairman of the house armed services committee 
there was no indication that aspin or any of the other 
congressmen who received donations knew the contributions were 
illegally funneled to them by sperry through defense consultants 
all five defendants agreed to cooperate with the justice 
departments continuing investigation of pentagon procurement fraud 
that has been nicknamed operation ill wind 
tomlin who was a program engineer at the navys space and naval 
warfare systems command until his retirement in 1985 is the third 
former pentagon official to admit taking bribes 
he pleaded guilty to conspiracy receiving bribes and tax 
evasion charges that are punishable by a maximum sentence of 25 
years and a 130000 fine 
evidence that two major contractors paid tomlin 475000 in 
bribes shows a disturbing pattern in the nations defense 
industry us attorney henry e hudson told reporters outside the 
us courthouse here 
hudson acknowledged that investigators were unaware of tomlin 
until a former unisys corp official and a consultant for the 
company pleaded guilty last march and began cooperating with the 
probe 
we do not have information that enables us to comment at this 
time said honeywell spokeswoman sylvia burgos wander 
there isnt anybody that would be involved in that thing that 
hasnt been thrown out the door or disciplined said peter hynes 
a spokesman for unisys which was formed in 1986 when burroughs 
corp acquired sperry 
according to court papers tomlin who now lives near orlando 
fla demanded 500000 from sperry corp in return for his 
influence in helping the company obtain lucrative contracts for 
computerized maintenance of electronic weapons components 
the court papers revealed that the bribery arrangement was 
approved by an unidentified highranking official of sperry corp 
and was also known to an executive at the companys clearwater 
fla electronics plant 
the clearwater executive told charles f gardner then a sperry 
vice president in charge of the companys surveillance and fire 
control systems division in great neck ny that tomlin was ready 
to retire and wanted a nest egg 
gardner who pleaded guilty to an unrelated bribery charge in 
march obtained approval of the arrangement to pay tomlin from his

if paramount communications incs 122 billion 
bid for time inc fails paramount chairman martin davis likely will 
turn his attention toward another acquisition target but observers 
say he also may have to protect his own company from possible 
unwanted bids 
a delaware judge on friday rejected paramounts request for an 
injunction against times 14 billion tender offer for warner 
communications inc paramount is appealing the decision but if the 
company fails before the delaware supreme court paramount says it 
wont pursue the combined time warner inc 
the timewarner deal effectively precludes any bidder at all 
and absolutely precludes any bidder at a price near 200 a share and 
that of course includes us paramount stated 
paramount has millions of dollars in expenses from the time bid 
to pay off but the company still has plenty of cash available and 
analysts expect davis to try to buy another property that would fit 
in with his expansion goals 
when paramount then called gulf amp western inc announced in 
april it was selling its consumer finance arm the associates the 
company said it would use the estimated 25 billion in proceeds to 
expand its remaining businesses entertainment and publishing 
both internally through product development and distribution and 
externally through acquisitions and investments 
davis declined to be interviewed friday and a paramount spokesman 
said the company would not comment on its plans or what its next 
move might be 
j kendrick noble an analyst with painewebber inc predicted 
paramount would be aggressively moving again soon davis next 
target likely would be smaller and something a little surer than 
this one noble said 
but noble said paramount could find itself the object of an 
unsolicited takeover bid 
davis in a meeting with analysts after paramount announced its 
original 107 billion bid for time said his company always was 
willing to consider a fair price that recognized the true value of 
the company noble said 
wall street traders also see paramount as a possible target the 
companys stock has fluctuated during the course of the time battle 
as rumors flew that the company was about to receive a bid 
but noble said if paramount does receive an offer the company 
is unlikely to be any more of a pushover than time was 
martin davis is quite a fighter and i dont think thats whats 
going to happen noble said 
when davis took over gulf amp western in 1983 the company was a 
conglomerate that manufactured a variety of products including 
bedding clothes chemicals auto and airplane parts sugar books 
and motion pictures 
davis who began his career at the companys paramount pictures 
subsidiary had a vision of the company as an entertainment and 
media giant and he has systematically pared its other segments 
besides paramount pictures the companys holdings include 
paramount television paramount home video madison square garden 
the new york knicks basketball team and new york rangers hockey team 
and the publishers simon amp schuster prentice hall and pocket books

bond prices sagged and longterm interest rates 
rose in volatile trading friday as the government reported economic 
data that werent weak enough to entice the credit markets 
the treasurys benchmark 30year bond fell 1332 point or about 
4 per 1000 face amount its yield which moves in the opposite 
direction from its price climbed to 808 percent from 803 percent 
late thursday 
initially evidence of economic weakness furnished by government 
reports inspired buying enthusiasm in the bond market but the rally 
soon faded 
in two separate reports the government said retail sales fell 
04 percent in june and the producer price index dipped by 01 
percent the first decline in this inflation measure in 18 months 
also the federal reserve said us industrial production fell 
02 percent last month while us factories mines and utilities 
used less of their operating capacity 
normally the credit market would welcome signs that a slowdown in 
economic activity is being accompanied by a moderation in inflation 
but maria f ramirez an economist at drexel burnham lambert 
inc said the market had built up hopes ahead of the numbers and 
pushed up bond prices to very high levels when the reports merely 
confirmed widely held views traders decided to sell and collect 
profits 
its not that the market is falling apart its retrenching a 
little bit from very expensive levels she said 
steven a wood an economist with bankamerica capital markets 
group in san francisco said the rally fizzled as traders cashed in 
profits on the belief the recent rally would go no further 
he also said the new figures were not weak enough to convince the 
fed to lower interest rates further 
at the least the next official move is going to be several 
weeks off at the earliest wood said 
in addition he said the market was slowed by news that a

the pentagon on friday lifted its suspension of 
a division of teledyne industries inc after the firm reimbursed the 
government and acted to prevent a recurrence of wrongdoing 
discovered in the ill wind probe of defense contract fraud 
larry j wilson a spokesman for the defense logistics agency 
said the lifting of the suspension against teledyne electronics co 
of newbury park calif meant it could again do business with the 
government 
the action took effect today wilson said 
the suspension was imposed in january when the parent company was 
indicted the indictments were based on allegations of wrongdoing by 
teledyne electronics three of its thencurrent employees and one 
former employee 
teledyne industries inc and three of the individuals were 
subsequently convicted the pentagon statement said 
on march 23 teledyne and a navy official pled guilty to charges 
stemming from the ill wind procurement probe with the navy man 
admitting he took a bribe to provide inside information on a 
contract 
the suspended navy official stuart e berlin agreed to 
cooperate with prosecutors in the investigation 
for its part teledyne agreed to pay 45 million in penalties 
and to satisfy other claims in the case 
wilson said the firm had reimbursed the government for the 
financial loss suffered as a result of teledyne electronics 
wrongdoing among other things it paid more than 2 million in 
civil penalties 15 million in criminal penalties and had paid 
the departments administrative costs for the probe wilson said 
the company had also taken steps to protect the government from 
business dealings with the individuals responsible for the 
wrongdoing and had also instituted internal controls such as an 
ethics program to protect against a recurrence said the 
statement 
according to fiscal 1987 figures the latest available the 
parent teledyne inc is the nations 46th largest defense 
contractor receiving 3594 million in pentagon business

allegations that private consultants bribed government employees for 
information that gave client companies an edge in winning contracts 
the indictments focused on activities alleged to have been 
undertaken by teledyne electronics navy procurement specialist 
stuart e berlin and private consultants fred h lackner and william 
l parkin 
specifically the indictment charged that teledyne and three of 
its officers agreed to pay parkin 160000 to assist them in 
obtaining a navy contract related to radar worth 100 million 
to obtain the contract the indictment contended parkin paid 
lackner a californiabased private consultant who in turn paid 
stuart e berlin for his assistance in manipulating the 
procurement process to insure that the contract was awarded to 
teledyne 
berkley baker a spokesman for teledyne said at the time of the 
suspension that the companys electronics division accounts for 
about 2 percent of our annual revenues or in the 75 million 
range

eastern airlines on friday requested to use 100 
million from a courtmonitored escrow account toward its rebuilding 
program and union leaders said it was a sign the carrier is 
struggling in the 4monthold strike 
a spokesman for the miamibased carrier contends it was well 
documented that eastern could use some profits from the sale of 
planes and other assets in its reorganization into a smaller company 
eastern filed papers in us bankruptcy court in new york seeking 
to free the 100 million to pay off expenses 
eastern spokesman robin matell said he does not know when a 
ruling may be issued 
it was known from the beginning that we could use some of the 
proceeds from our asset transactions for rebuilding said matell 
i dont see why anyone is shocked by this 
but the air line pilots association on friday said easterns 
request for the funds suggests cashflow problems in operating a 
smaller carrier 
easterns request is evidence that the companys reorganization 
plan is seriously flawed the alpa statement said 
matell said eastern is planning to sell 18 billion in assets 
including a proposed 2065 million sale of 16 planes two canadian 
routes and 13 gates at philadelphia international airport to midway 
airlines in june eastern sold its profitable northeast shuttle 
service to billionaire donald trump for 365 million 
eastern which has tried to lure back passengers with reduced 
fares has announced plans to double its present flight schedule by 
august and build up to about 800 daily flights by the end of the 
year 
eastern flew 1040 flights per day before machinists flight 
attendants and pilots walked off the job march 4 the airline sought 
bankruptcycourt protection march 9 
alpa also reported that creditors committee attorney joe zweibel 
said negotiations with eastern are certainly going to be colored 
because of the request zweibel could not be reached for comment 
friday

further information on the eastern bankruptcy proceedings

southmark corp a large real estate company 
plagued by indebtedness stemming partly from its reliance on 
junkbond financing filed friday for federal bankruptcy protection 
from creditors 
the troubled company had been attempting to avoid bankruptcy by 
restructuring its property and financial holdings but a 1 billion 
first quarter loss placed it in technical default on the junk 
bonds creditors had begun taking steps to force the company into 
bankruptcy 
the chapter 11 bankruptcy filing is one of the largest ever by a 
company that used junk bonds as part of its financial strategy 
revco ds inc a national drugstore chain that relied on junk 
bonds in a debtfinanced takeover sought chapter 11 bankruptcy a 
year ago after failing to make an interest payment on about 700 
million in junk bonds 
these bonds commonly used by companies to bankroll expansion and 
acquisitions are considered lowinvestment grade securities they 
pay high rates of interest to compensate bondholders for the higher 
risk of buying them 
southmark has about 32000 employees and 13000 shareholders 
formerly known as citizens and southern realty investors the 
company buys improves and sells real estate assets manages 
apartments nursing homes shopping centers and office buildings 
and owns san jacinto savings and loan the ninthlargest sampl in 
texas 
southmarks previously disclosed forecasts show it cannot 
continue to pay its interest and principal amortization obligations 
beyond nov 1 1989 chairman arthur g weiss said in announcing 
the bankruptcy filing it would be unfair to large portions of the 
companys constituencies to continue to pay the debt service in the 
interim given all the circumstances 
accordingly the board of directors has decided to discontinue 
its policy of paying all debt service as it comes due 
wall street securities strategists that follow southmark had been 
predicting bankruptcy was a strong possibility and warned clients to 
avoid the companys stock 
we see scant appeal to the individual investor in these 
shares mark robertson an analyst for the value line investment 
survey in new york wrote in a june report about thecompanys 
deteriorating financial condition 
weiss said southmark will continue to operate while reorganizing 
but could not predict when the company would emerge from bankruptcy 
we chose reorganization through the court in light of our 
responsibilities to all of southmarks key constitutiencies 
creditors stockholders and bondholders employees customers and 
business partners and vendors and suppliers 
as part of the filing southmark received agreement from the 
federal home loan bank board that as long as the company can meet 
regulatory capital requirements at san jacinto savings and loan the 
government will not seek to shut down the 35 billionasset thrift 
weiss has said before he hopes to base southmarks resurgence on 
stillsolvent san jacinto 
the filing in us bankruptcy court in atlanta where the company 
is incorporated lists assets of 105 billion and liabilities of 
14 billion including 105 billion in unsecured debt sold through 
drexel burnham lambert inc a leading issuer and marketer of junk 
bonds 
under chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code a company is 
protected from creditors while it devises a way to pay its debts and 
reorganize its business 
southmark which began as a real estate investment trust 
operation of georgias citizens amp southern corp used the junk 
bonds to finance its rapid growth into a 8 billionasset company 
with holdings from campgrounds to insurance companies and a range of 
real estate enterprises 
however the company which eventually moved to dallas has been 
strapped by liquidity problems as it became victimized by the 
southwests real estate collapse and was left holding huge numbers 
of nonperforming assets 
the liquidity problems eventually led to the ouster in january of 
chairman gene e phillips and vice chairman william s friedman who 
were blamed for the situation 
the board replaced with two with weiss a thrift executive from 
georgia in the months since the company has sold off about 170 
million in assets to improve its cash position 
we have improved liquidity through asset sales weiss said 
friday adding that the company had 85 million on hand to pay 
operating expenses 
we will continue our program to sell selected assets he 
said leaving the company with a core of real estate and thrift 
operations without undue pressure from creditors we can seek 
maximum value for these assets 
the company said it would continue to seek buyers for its 
insurance recreational land health care and gaming interests
