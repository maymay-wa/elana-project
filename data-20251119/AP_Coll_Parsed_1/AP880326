a state weight inspector whose boss says 
he tipped the scales at 500 pounds himself and kept growing out 
of the uniforms is appealing his firing by the north dakota 
highway patrol 
melvin hansen of wahpeton who is awaiting a hearing before the 
state personnel board on wednesday was given five reasons in 
writing for being fired including his weight his lawyer hal 
stutsman said friday 
hansen was dismissed july 31 from his job in a scale house where 
he weighed trucks and inspected cargo 
to say we terminated the guy because he was overweight is 
basically unfair said brian berg superintendent of the highway 
patrol i feel bad for the guy we tried to work with him to 
improve his situation he left us no alternative in our opinion 
berg said hansens weight probably contributed to other 
things personal health habits would be a polite way of saying 
it 
highway patrol policy requires employees to maintain 
appropriate health levels weight levels and physical fitness 
levels as determined by the departments doctor personnel 
officer richard anagnost said 
anagnost said hansen was informed that reasons for his firing 
included his failure to follow the doctors recommendations about 
weight loss his appearance and grooming and his inability to wear 
a uniform while on duty 
hansen weighed 325 in 1983 and 500 pounds when he was fired 
berg said he kept growing out of the uniforms we refused to 
keep altering them 
stutsman refused to discuss details of the appeal and hansen 
referred all questions to his lawyer when contacted friday 
stutsman called hansen a fairly goodsized man thats for 
sure but he said his clients weight is disputed in part 
because they have never really had an adequate scale to weigh him 
on 
hansen in his 40s had worked for the highway patrol since 1977 
in the agencys truck regulatory division stutsman said his exact 
age was unavailable

fighting an image that alaska is cold and 
forsaken all year the state tourism division is running new tv ads 
that get a little goodnatured revenge by poking fun at its 
bigstate rival texas 
four years ago former texas gov mark white said he didnt 
believe anyone would want to visit alaska which he called a frozen 
wasteland said state tourism marketing director mary klugherz 
we basically took that page from history in making the 
series of six commercials klugherz said 
in the commercials a governor visits alaska to see for himself 
why people come here the governors state is not identified but 
you can tell hes from texas klugherz said hes sort of an 
lbj lookalike 
the governor also wears a 10gallon hat and cowboy boots 
the first commercial shows the governor visiting alaska and 
discovering the summer weather is great the second ad says the 
governors aides are coming north to look for him because he 
apparently has decided he enjoys it in alaska so much he stayed 
longer than expected 
people still believe alaska endures cold snow and ice all year 
said klugherz were trying to tell travelers the truth she 
said 
july temperatures in anchorage average in the high 50s with 
daytime temperatures often in the 60 to 70degree range 
in past ad campaigns tourism officials have pitched the states 
scenery and wildlife klugherz said this year were basically 
hitting the weather headon she said 
the tourism division is spending 23 million to air the 
commercials on network stations in 20 cities in the lower 48 the 
ads started running last month and will continue through april 
klugherz said 
the ads will not run in texas because its too expensive to 
advertise there she said

the aging of americas population led to a 
national record of 21 million deaths last year but births topped 
38 million for the highest number in 23 years the government says 
the national center for health statistics reported friday that 
deaths in 1987 totaled 2127000 about 28000 more than the 
previous year and the largest number ever reported for the united 
states 
deaths from heart disease the nations no 1 killer slipped 
slightly but cancer claimed more victims than in the year before 
the study showed 
the nations overall death rate was about the same as in 1986 
at about 87 deaths per 1000 people thats because the number of 
fatalities increased at about the same rate as the population grew 
the study noted 
the study also found that marriage and divorce rates changed 
little remaining at relatively low levels 
births which had dipped somewhat in 1986 climbed 3 percent the 
following year to an estimated 3829000 
the 1987 provisional total is the largest number reported 
since 1964 the study said the fertility rate was 661 live 
births per 1000 women aged 1544 up from 649 in 1986 
the rising number of births that have occurred in recent years 
has resulted from the large number of women born during the post 
world war ii baby boom who have now entered their main 
childbearing years 
that has prompted population experts to term the recent rise in 
births an echo of the baby boom 
they insist it is not in itself another baby boom however 
pointing out that birth rates have remained well below those of the 
1950s and early 1960s 
subtracting deaths from births the study reported a natural 
increase in population of 1702000 people last year 3 percent 
more than in 1986 
just slightly over twice as many couples married as were 
divorced during the year the annual report found 
marriages in 1987 totaled 2421000 1 percent more than the 
year before that represented a marriage rate of 99 per 1000 
population that was the lowest rate since 1977 when it was also 
99 
meanwhile there were 1157000 divorces last year a 1 percent 
decline the divorce rate was 48 per 1000 people about the same 
as the year before and the lowest divorce rate since 1975 
the report also looked at causes of death reported across the 
nation and found a decline in heart disease fatalities but an 
increase in cancer deaths between 1986 and 1987 
because it takes longer to compile the detailed figures the 
causeofdeath statistics were reported for the 12month period 
ending with november 1987 rather than for the calendar year 
for all causes the 1987 rate was reported at 8730 deaths per 
100000 people down from 8733 in 1986 
the rate for major cardiovascular diseases slipped from 4018 
per 100000 in 1986 to 3957 in 1987 the study said 
but at the same time the death rate for all types of cancer 
increased from 1937 per 100000 to 1959 
among the other causes of death reported were diabetes 154 per 
100000 up from 152 stroke 610 down from 616 pneumonia and 
influenza 282 down from 287 chronic lung disease 317 up 
from 313 chronic liver disease 107 down from 108 accidents 
381 down from 389 and suicide 121 down from 126

the defense department will try to prop up the 
slumping us bearing industry with a requirement that makers of 
jets submarines and other military systems use only americanmade 
bearings 
the buyamerican regulation due to be published monday in 
the federal register would be in place for at least three years 
said rep nancy l johnson rconn who pushed for the rule she 
called it a tremendous victory for us bearing makers 
the domestic industry has been severely eroded by foreign 
competition in recent years nearly 65 percent of ball bearings 
sold in the united states come from abroad and 40 percent of the 
roller bearing sales are from imports 
the defense department is a major buyer of bearings making up 
nearly 19 percent of the us market the pentagon buys a majority 
of the superprecision bearings used in jets and submarines 
congressional proponents warn that the sagging domestic industry 
would be unable to gear up for wartime production they point to a 
1986 pentagon study that said the bearing industry is critical to 
the nations defense and warned that domestic manufacturers were in 
imminent danger of being unable to support national defense 
needs 
this action is clearly needed to halt a trend that directly 
jeopardizes our ability to defend ourselves said mrs johnson a 
founder of the congressional bearing caucus whose western 
connecticut district includes several major bearing employers 
this new policy will prevent the loss of even more business 
overseas and give our bearings companies the breathing room they 
need to regain their competitive edge she said 
the new regulations would cover only combatrelated systems and 
not nonmilitary items bought by the pentagon such as bearings for 
automobiles according to johnson aide caroline willson military 
bearings make up more than half the bearings purchased by the 
department 
about 40 million of the 350 million in militaryrelated 
bearings purchased by the defense department annually comes from 
foreign countries and that trend has been increasing the 
congresswoman said 
from 1980 to 1986 she said the number of foreign manufacturers 
authorized to sell bearings to the pentagon increased from two to 
12 mrs johnson said that would have climbed to 30 companies by 
1990 without the new regulations 
mrs johnson and other industrialarea lawmakers are supporting 
an industry request to the commerce department urging restrictions 
on foreign imports the department has until july to respond to 
last summers request and make a recommendation to president reagan 
since 1980 the industry has lost 15000 jobs a 20 percent 
decrease thirty plant closings have left about 80 companies 
remaining and 43000 employees ms willson said

critics say president reagan interfered with 
the legal process by predicting that former white house aides 
oliver l north and john m poindexter will be acquitted of charges 
in the irancontra affair 
in offthecuff remarks friday reagan called the affair the 
socalled scandal and said he still considers north a hero 
but he refused to say whether he was considering granting any 
pardons in the case 
i just have to believe that theyre going to be found innocent 
because i dont think they were guilty of any lawbreaking or any 
crime reagan said in response to a question at a seminar 
sponsored by the center for the study of the presidency 
north and poindexter along with arms dealers richard v secord 
and albert a hakim pleaded innocent thursday to charges of 
conspiracy theft and fraud in the irancontra case the case 
involved the sale of us arms to iran and the diversion of 
proceeds to the nicaraguan contras 
senate majority whip alan cranston dcalif said reagans 
comment about the innocence or guilt of people under criminal 
indictment is highly inappropriate 
his statement could adversely and improperly influence the 
execution of justice cranston told reporters on capitol hill 
president reagan has contributed to a prejudicial climate 
which could make it extremely difficult to get an unbiased jury in 
these cases he said the president has made a judgment about 
guilt or innocence which only a jury is supposed to decide under 
our system of justice 
professor john f banzhaf iii of george washington university 
law school called reagans remarks highly inappropriate and 
said they could influence jurors in the case 
millions of people feel strongly in favor of the president and 
his views carry great weight he has an awful lot of credibility 
said banzhaf a consumer advocate who has been associated with 
liberal causes this is prejudging the case 
in 1970 defense lawyers unsuccessfully sought dismissal of 
murder charges against charles manson after thenpresident richard 
m nixon said manson was guilty directly or indirectly of eight 
murders without reason 
nixon subsequently issued a statement saying he had not intended 
to proclaim manson guilty and that a person was presumed innocent 
until proven otherwise 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater questioned about 
reagans remarks said hes a man who tells you what he thinks 
and thats what he thinks he said the president was a man of 
rare insight and perception just giving his perception there 
white house chief of staff howard h baker described the 
presidents remarks as personal views and said the presidents 
official position is that the system must operate 
reagan said that when he learned that proceeds from the arms 
sales to iran had been channeled to the contra cause he had top 
aides brief congressional leaders and appointed a commission to 
probe the matter reagan also noted that he had sought the 
appointment of a special counsel to investigate the diversion 
now thats the whole extent of the socalled scandal he 
said what our intent was and what happened and you know 
something after all the investigations today i still dont know 
who got that extra money or where it came from im hoping to find 
out 
but i wanted you to know that i have some definite reason for 
still thinking ollie north is a hero he added 
reagan previously had said he did not think any laws were broken 
in the irancontra affair but had never gone so far as to predict 
acquittals

five private exporters have been given the 
green light for subsidized sales to the soviet union of 475000 
metric tons of hard red winter wheat the agriculture department 
says 
the governments commodity credit corp has approved inkind 
bonuses averaging 2195 a ton in value to the exporters to send 
the wheat to the soviet union in may the foreign agricultural 
service said in a statement friday 
under the export enhancement program approved by congress in 
1985 grain companies and other exporters receive governmentowned 
crops as bonuses to spur overseas sales of american commodities 
subsidized sales of wheat to the soviets have totaled more than 
108 million tons since last april officials said and the program 
is playing an increasingly large role in the overall us farm 
export picture 
melvin e sims general sales manager of the foreign 
agricultural service identified those receiving the bonuses and 
the amounts of grain involved as garnac grain company inc 50000 
tons richco grain ltd 200000 tons mitsubishi international 
corp 25000 tons artfer inc 50000 and louis dreyfus corp 
150000 tons 
the soviets may still purchase an additional 525000 tons under 
a 2 million ton offer made by the united states on jan 29 
the united states also made the soviets a further 1 millionton 
offer on saturday 
the two countries are preparing to negotiate a new longterm 
grain agreement to replace the one that expires sept 30 
it calls for the soviets to buy 9 million metric tons a year of 
which 4 million must be wheat and 4 million corn the remainder may 
be in wheat corn soybeans or soybean meal with every ton of 
beans or meal counting as two tons of grain 
despite the agreement wheat sales to the soviets slumped badly 
in 1986 but picked up against last year as the united states gave 
that country the green light for purchases under the subsidy 
program

giveaways of government surplus milk to poor 
people are set to resume temporarily in june after a planned 
suspension in may according to the agriculture department 
just how long the distribution of nonfat dry milk under the 
temporary emergency food assistance program can continue beyond 
june remains uncertain the department said in a statement friday 
suspension of the nonfat dry milk and cheese distributions was 
announced in february amid dwindling stocks of governmentowned 
commodities usda inventories however have again climbed to the 
point that 8 million pounds can be distributed through local food 
banks in june the department said 
at this time we do not know if distribution of nonfat dry 
milk can be continued beyond june assistant secretary for food 
and consumer services john bode said in a statement 
he said the department would monitor our inventories and keep 
states informed of availability 
the same is true for cheese he said if we get more 
well give it away 
also announced in february was a suspension of rice and honey 
distributions this month because of declining reserves 
the actions have drawn fire from capitol hill where senate 
agriculture committee chairman patrick j leahy dvt is holding 
hearings on the problem of hunger and focusing on the tefap 
he planned a grocerybagging session at a downtown washington 
food bank on monday to draw attention to the issue 
leahy said after the usda announcement of june milk distribution 
that he was pleased that theres an additional temporary supply 
for the month but this does not address the longterm problem 
more than 5 billion pounds of surplus food worth more than 5 
billion has been distributed since 1981 when the program got under 
way on orders from president reagan the department said 
seven types of goods have been provided cheese butter nonfat 
dry milk honey corn meal flour and rice

republican conservatives in congress are wary 
of the nicaraguan ceasefire with one saying the united states may 
have to take some action with external forces if the contra 
rebels quit the field 
its down to that said rep rod chandler rwash its 
definitely a new era 
chandler was among gop conservatives attending a retreat friday 
in houston in washington meanwhile president reagan said that 
there is reason to have caution about whether nicaraguas 
leftist government will keep its agreements 
reagans comments were his first statement in any detail on the 
60day nationwide ceasefire announced wednesday in sapoa 
nicaragua by leaders of the sandinista government and the 
usbacked contra guerrilla force 
of course we look forward to this and hope it continues but 
just as in some other meetings that have gone on in which i 
have been involved i think that we should keep in mind that both 
parties must be dedicated to the things that are said and agreed to 
in those meetings the president said 
i think there is reason to have caution they have a past 
record that indicates that we should be he added 
reagan was questioned by reporters as he prepared to meet with 
president joaquin balaguer of the dominican republic 
in a formal statement as he appeared with balaguer in the rose 
garden after the meeting reagan commended the dominican president 
for hosting previous nicaraguan peace talks mediated by roman 
catholic cardinal obando y bravo 
we both hope for democratic and peaceful solutions to the 
problems of the region he said we want to see an end to the 
pursuit of military solutions and to the massive soviet armament 
that fuels that pursuit 
during his daily white house news briefing earlier presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration believes that 
this agreement has been reached by both sides in good faith but 
is skeptical of the compliance 
were very hopeful that it works fitzwater said we want 
to do whatever we can to see that it works 
the spokesman also said the administration is very hopeful 
that a package of humanitarian assistance to the contras can be 
approved by the house and senate before congress easter recess 
he said the united states had no intention of entering into 
direct discussions with the sandinistas as suggested by nicaraguan 
president daniel ortega 
weve discussed that two years fitzwater said the answer 
is no 
at the houston retreat chandler said that if the contras fold 
their tents and it is back to the usual sandinista behavior of 
totalitarian rule the united states will have to take some 
action with external forces external including the united 
states 
chandler who has cosponsored a plan to renew military aid to 
the contras said he expected congress in the meantime to approve 
rapidly some new humanitarian support for the contras with the 
option of adding military aid if things turn sour 
in washington other conservatives criticized the agreement but 
appeared willing to put the sandinistas to the test and wait to see 
whether promised democratic reforms materialize 
its an agreement thats shaded on the bad side said sen 
james mcclure ridaho 
sen jesse helms rnc said a sense of euphoria is not in 
order i dont believe ive ever heard of a leopard changing his 
spots 
sen ted stevens ralaska said the end product of what 
theyve agreed to still leaves a soviet puppet state in central 
america

new jersey rep james howard whose death at 
age 60 leaves open a powerful congressional post was a widely 
admired lawmaker who loved a good legislative scrap almost as much 
as he loved golf 
the 60yearold democrat died friday a day after suffering a 
heart attack on a suburban maryland golf course his office said 
howard influential chairman of the house public works and 
transportation committee succumbed at the washington hospital 
center here at 146 pm said aide david smallen 
a roman catholic funeral was planned for tuesday in spring lake 
nj 
howards office said the spring lake heights lawmaker died of 
complications arising from a heart attack from which his heart 
never fully recovered they did not elaborate 
howard a 22year house veteran was stricken thursday while 
playing the first hole of a morning round of golf his last 
memory was that he was wearing irish green and hit a great shot 
that landed him on the green in two said his daughter marie who 
was with him at the time 
howards wife marlene and their two other daughters also were 
with him 
sen edward m kennedy dmass recalled howards fondness for 
kennedys brother the late president john f kennedy 
the last time i saw him last week he asked me for another 
pt109 tie clip and we reminisced again about jacks 1960 
campaign kennedy said in a statement 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said of howard he worked 
hard played hard loved his family his state and his country with 
a burning intensity 
sen bill bradley dnj said howard was one of his first 
friends in politics he leaves a great legacy of 
accomplishments bradley said 
howard was known among colleagues as one of the houses toughest 
horse traders he was an aggressive and agile lawmaker who wielded 
his considerable clout in an oldfashioned behindthescenes way 
the committee he headed since 1981 is one of the least glamorous 
but most powerful in congress it has jurisdiction over 
multibillion dollar highway and water projects as well as the 
airline and trucking industries 
once in 1985 massachusetts lawmakers mounted a plan to legalize 
dumping of their states sewage off the new jersey coast suddenly 
money for a much soughtafter boston harbor tunnel slipped to the 
bottom of the public works committees agenda

of the new jersey congressional delegation after rep peter rodino 
the chairman of the house judiciary committee who says he will not 
seek reelection 
howard represented the 3rd congressional district along new 
jerseys central shorefront 
rep glenn anderson dcalif the ranking democrat of the 
public works committee is in line to succeed howard any new 
chairman must be approved by the house democratic caucus

equipment corp in an effort to keep digital from becoming more 
dependent on japanese suppliers a published report said friday

we allowed japan to take the lead written by clyde prestowitz 
and scheduled for publication in late april the times said 
prestowitz formerly the commerce departments chief trade 
negotiator with japan wrote that in mid1987 ibm approached 
digital its most dangerous domestic rival and offered to 
transfer certain key technologies 
at first dec suspected a trick then it realized the objective 
was to prevent dec from falling even further into japanese hands

a lone salamander made its way through a 
tunnel built to prevent cars from crushing the amphibians during 
their annual trek across a street in this college town 
it was an historic event it was the first salamander to go 
through a tunnel all on its own shutesbury school teacher ken 
lindsay said friday 
but 39 other salamanders bypassed the tunnels to the dismay of 
onlookers 
fifty people turned out on a drizzly thursday night to watch the 
salamanders cross henry street to reach a breeding pond a route 
that results in death for many of the creatures each spring 
the watchers ended up barricading the street and carrying about 
40 of the struggling yellowspotted amphibians across the road the 
tunnels installed for the salamanders under the street were ignored 
by all but the one 
shouts went up when the salamander was discovered crawling along 
a fence leading to one of the tunnels the creature made it through 
in 5 minutes 20 seconds said lindsay who lives about a mile from 
the street 
the salamander tunnels were installed after a public outcry over 
the amphibians plight 
local naturalist robert winston persuaded town officials to 
close the street last year until all the salamanders had emerged 
from their underground hibernation to make the nighttime trek 
during warm rains which usually takes a week 
the three 19inchhigh tunnels of polymer concrete were donated 
by aco polymer products of cleveland and installed in november for 
about 2000 volunteers erected fences in january to guide the 
salamanders to the tunnels 
the fences failed their first test but townspeople said it was 
too early to tell how the experiment would fare 
there were very few salamanders out probably because theres 
not enough of a saturation rate yet to rouse the rest of the 
population said lindsay 
townspeople had different theories to explain why all but one of 
the salamanders bypassed the tunnels 
lindsay who also coordinated a contest for salamander 
crossing sings said the salamanders might have been hibernating 
between the fence and the road 
richard minear chairman of the board of selectmen said the 
tunnels may not have been wet enough for the salamanders liking 
the towns superintendent of public works said he is in the 
process of hanging the crossing signs designed by shutesbury 
fourthgrader rachel mackintosh

catherine malfitano sang the title role in 
bergs lulu for the first time at the metropolitan opera on 
friday night 
she sang it well leaving only the question of whether the 
luminous lyric quality of her soprano voice will survive a role 
composed with so many shrieks on top and such angular intervals 
she is singing all six performances which includes the saturday 
afternoon radio broadcast of april 2 
tenor ronald hamilton a native of hamilton ohio made his met 
debut as alwa on friday night lulu is a difficult opera in 
which to judge voices but hamilton certainly coped with the very 
high range of a fairly large but thankless role 
franz mazura was excellent as dr schon alwas father tatiana 
troyanos was properly selfsacrificing as the countess james 
levine conducted with the orchestra sometimes at times 
overpowering the singers 
the john dexter production from 1977 captures the decadence of 
the story in which everybody falls for lulu some to die of 
suicide murder or shock 
the met performed lulu for the first time in 1977 and 
performed it with the third act added making it a fourhour 
evening for the first time in 1980

a federal appeals court will hear arguments 
may 6 on whether to dismiss a contempt ruling against eastern 
airlines for its attempt to sell its east coast air shuttle 
the hearing date was set friday when the court also refused a 
request by eastern to block a set of sanctions levied against the 
carrier the ruling by the us circuit court of appeals means 
eastern at least temporarily will have to halt its efforts to 
sell the shuttle while it conducts a legal battle with its largest 
labor union 
judges david sentelle james l buckley and laurence h 
silberman all voted to deny easterns request to drop the sanctions 
on march 10 district judge john h pratt found eastern in 
contempt for trying to sell its shuttle for 225 million eastern 
a subsidiary of texas air corp proposed selling the shuttle to a 
new company to be created within texas air 
pratt found that the proposed sale violated an order he issued 
last july that eastern not change the working conditions of its 
12000 employees represented by the international association of 
machinists and aerospace workers 
company officials had said eastern was in the red and needed the 
cash from the sale but union leaders said the deal really was 
intended to weaken the labor organization 
monday pratt ruled that until the case was settled eastern 
would have to halt all efforts to gain government approval of the 
shuttle sale the judge also threatened to fine the airline 10000 
daily for future violations 
under fridays ruling the sanctions will remain in place until 
easterns appeal of the contempt ruling is decided

the reagan administration is halting its 
supply of stinger missiles to the afghan rebels because of concern 
the weapons could be left to afghan factions that couldnt be 
controlled if us military ties were severed according to a 
published report today 
the washington post citing diplomatic and other us sources 
that it did not identify also reported that the administration is 
rushing at least 300 million in other weapons to the resistance 
before an agreement is reached that would ban such outside 
assistance 
among the uspurchased military equipment being rushed to the 
resistance are 120mm spanish heavy mortars and modern mineclearing 
weapons the post said 
the decision to stop supplying the antiaircraft stingers 
apparently was reached late last month in anticipation of a peace 
settlement in afghanistan the newspaper said 
certainly we would not want the war to end with a lot of them 
unused said rep charles wilson dtexas a strong supporter of 
the resistance who said he did not know if a decision had been made 
to stop supplying the stingers 
last month an afghan guerrilla commander either sold or was 
forced to hand over some stingers to iran pieces of a stinger were 
found on an iranian gunboat involved in a shooting incident with a 
us helicopter helping the us escort mission in the persian gulf 
last october 
the afghan rebels started receiving the stingers in mid1986 and 
they reportedly have gotten more than 1000 of them the post said 
a withdrawal of soviet troops from afghanistan was a major topic 
discussed during this past weeks visit to washington of soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze

two cubic corp employees were charged friday 
with falsifying test results on handheld mine detectors produced 
for the army 
in announcing the indictment us attorney peter nunez also 
said that the san diegobased defense contractor had agreed to pay 
the government 725 million to settle a civil suit stemming from 
the allegations 
william bauder 55 of tullahoma tenn and dennis b fink 39 
of san diego pleaded innocent in federal court friday to 
conspiracy to defraud the government making false statements and 
submitting false claims for payment 
each of the 24 counts in the indictment carries a maximum 
penalty of five years in prison and a 10000 fine 
cubic held a 9 million army contract to produce and retrofit 
more than 8500 detectors designed to locate mines in arid soil 
the justice department said the devices were never used in combat 
by american forces 
fink was the senior associate engineer on the technical staff 
while bauder was the program manager for cubic defense systems on 
the contract signed in 1981 
before fullscale production could begin cubic had to 
demonstrate that it could mass produce minedetectors that worked 
as effectively as earlier prototypes the indictment said 
the indictment alleged that the test results were falsified so 
that the mine detectors appeared to function better than they 
really did 
as a result of the false information the indictment said the 
army gave approval for fullscale production but terminated the 
contract in 1984 because of equipment faults 
in the civil suit prosecutors alleged cubic knowingly presented 
false claims for payment because some company officials were aware 
that the detectors had failed the tests 
under an agreement with the army cubic company will remain a 
government contractor 
since the events leading to the indictment cubic has taken 
the necessary steps to avoid a recurrence of similar conduct 
nunez said

gen manuel antonio noriega has 
failed for the first time to pay the 15000 troops supporting him 
as panamas economic crisis deepens and the opposition promises 
more confrontation 
also friday the civilian government that acts for noriega 
threatened to revoke stores licenses unless they stop observing a 
weeklong general strike and open to sell such essentials as food 
medicine and gasoline 
the strike has shut down more than 90 percent of the nations 
commerce cash and food are in short supply 
the opposition meanwhile said it was planning massive street 
antinoriega demonstrations for monday that appeared likely to 
trigger a confrontation with troops loyal to the general 
noriega under indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges once again claimed the united states in a 
desire to hold on to the panama canal is behind his countrys 
troubles 
a man is not the problem noriega said of himself on friday 
the problem is panamas canal and the presence of a foreign army 
in our territory 
in an attempt to force noriega into exile the white house has 
had panamanian deposits in us banks frozen and payments for use 
of the panama canal withheld 
the former canal zone is headquarters to the us militarys 
southern command under a 1977 treaty the united states will cede 
control of the canal by the year 2000 
noriega denied any connections with drugtrafficking pilots 
whose testimony led to his indictments last month and joked about 
reports he wields a 200 million fortune bring it to me bring 
it to me and ill pay off panamas foreign debt 
he implied force might be used to make the nations banks 
reopen on thursday they refused to hand over an estimated 70 
million in their vaults so the government could pay the army on 
friday pensioners monday and 130000 public employees over the 
next week 
banks have refused to open partly to support the general strike 
and partly because they fear a panic run on their deposits 
those who understand such things consider it necessary to open 
the banks noriega said 
opposition leaders said they hoped noriegas soldiers would stop 
supporting him now that they have joined the 25 million 
panamanians who have gone without pay for up to a month 
but the antinoriega umbrella group the national civic crusade 
suffered a surprising blow friday when roman catholic archbishop 
marcos c mcgrath failed to issue an expected statement strongly 
condemning noriega and supporting mondays planned demonstration 
mcgrath who had met with noriega on thursday would only say on 
friday that he planned to meet with again with the general who 
heads panamanas defense forces 
rep gary ackerman dny ended a twoday factfinding trip 
friday saying he was still hopeful that at some time the church 
will be able to make a statement that will bring a happier remedy 
than we have seen so far 
ackerman and rep peter kostmayer dpa issued a statement 
saying there is absolute unanimity that gen noriega should go 
and that his departure is only a function of time 
that sentiment was echoed in washington where the senate voted 
920 to demand that president reagan increase economic sanctions to 
force noriega out 
in the former canal zone wives of the mostly american ship 
pilots who guide vessels through the panama canal and could shut 
the waterway down if they went on strike demonstrated in front of 
the joint uspanamanian commission that runs the canal 
they complained they were being harassed by panamanian troops 
who set up roadblocks at intersections across panama city 
questioning motorists and searching their cars 
we feel like we are hostages within the political crisis 
because we feel unsafe going into town said gloria olsson wife 
of a canal pilot 
the problem was apparently resolved later friday but the panama 
canal pilots association and the commission refused to say what 
arrangements were made

a new fiscal survey of the states finds 
that most states tightened their budget belts last year and are 
reluctant to start major new programs this year because of 
uncertainty about the economy 
the report from the national governors association says most 
states are in sound financial shape although states such as 
louisiana and west virginia are facing tough financial times 
because of their reliance on the troubled energy industry 
most states however are close to the financial edge according 
to the report released friday it found that the majority of states 
will end the year with only small budget balances 
those balances are expected to fall to 15 percent of total 
expenditures at the end of next fiscal year the lowest level since 
the recession of 1983 when it was 13 percent

two senators say the united states should be 
cautious about allowing the sale to canada of highly secret us 
submarine technology 
sen james j exon dneb chairman of the senate armed 
services strategic weapons subcommittee said friday that us 
nuclearpowered sub technology had only been transferred once in 
the past to britain and he questioned whether canada has the 
money and the enormous infrastructure needed to safely operate 
the subs 
any accidents aboard canadian subs which involve us technology 
would raise fears about us subs and could hamper the american 
navys operation he said in a speech to the senate 
sen john warner rva said before we approve this 
decision we need to know how canada proposes to fund this program 
how canada proposes to insure that the standard of nuclear safety 
will be at least as high as the united states and the british 
canada is considering building vessels which are updated 
versions of the british trafalgarclass subs or the french 
rubisclass subs the trafalgars use us technology which means 
the information could not be supplied to canada by the british 
unless the united states approves both exon and warner said

felipe and his wife donilda teachers 
at government high schools who havent been paid since midmonth 
are selling bootleg beer to feed themselves and their three 
children 
they eat only twice a day even so they are luckier than one 
neighbor in the poor villa guadalupe neighborhood in the san 
miguelito hills on the outskirts of panama city who had sent her 
children out to steal 
as the opposition exerts pressure to oust strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega and cash grows increasingly scarce many 
panamanians are relying on donated food to stay alive 
families have sent their children to stay with relatives in the 
countryside where fresh milk and produce is at least more readily 
available than in the capital 
felipe who insisted on not being further identified for fear of 
reprisal said several stores in his neighborhood mostly owned by 
panamanians of chinese descent have been robbed during the past 
couple of weeks 
people are not stealing money they are stealing food he 
said this woman the other day told her kids to go in that store 
and grab some milk when the owner came chasing after them she 
faced him with a big stick and told him her kids had to eat and she 
would kill him if he tried to stop them 
what do we tell the kids we are teaching felipe asked 
we have suffered years of bad government in this country he 
said of 20 years under military rule i am not very political 
but things must change noriegas departure would be the 
beginning of the political solution 
the general who heads the 15000strong defense forces and is 
panamas de facto ruler is under us indictment on charges of 
trafficking in colombian cocaine 
the united states seeking to force him out has frozen 
virtually all panamas funds in us banks including panama canal 
tolls the countrys main source of revenue 
since the us dollar is panamas currency the cash shortage 
became doubly acute most of the countrys 118 banks have been 
closed for three weeks some for longer 
there have been street demonstrations some of them violent and 
a general strike has paralyzed the nation since monday noriega has 
dug in his heels and refuses to leave 
felipe and his wife together normally net 170 a month after 
deductions for taxes and payments on a governmentfinanced mortgage 
on their threebedroom concrete block home 
each got their last paycheck for 75 on march 15 it was the 
last time the government paid employees and many didnt get 
anything 
felipe used to make about 40 more a month refereeing soccer 
matches but the games havent been played since the crisis began 
there is no money 
a strong wiry man with a mustache and a tiny tuft of beard on 
his chin felipe held his restless 4yearold son francisco trying 
to quiet him 
we make adjustments we survive he said 
that morning felipe and his family had oatmeal some cheese and 
bread for breakfast donilda was planning to cook some fish and 
rice for lunch but there would be some tea and bread only in the 
evening she said 
felipe said he hadnt paid his light and water bills 
with the schools closed until further notice felipe spends his 
time doing odd jobs around the house training his 12yearold 
daughter zulia and other kids in the neighborhood in track and 
field 
and he digs into his savings buying american bootleg beer and 
cigarettes which he resells making about 4 profit on each case of 
beer 
a lot of people are doing that people will always buy beer 
he explained sweating in panamas tropical heat 
a few blocks away several hundred people stood in line outside 
the christ redeemer roman catholic church which has been donating 
bags of food and running a soup kitchen for the destitute

president miguel de la madrid strongly 
criticized the reagan administration for stressing might over 
diplomacy in its central american policy at a high cost in death 
and destruction 
we oppose the justification for acts of intervention or 
economic coercion in central america he said friday during a 
state dinner for visiting president vinicio cerezo of guatemala 
the protection of our security isnt associated with strategic 
projects of doubtful standing he added in comments clearly aimed 
at the reagan administration though not mentioning the united 
states by name 
de la madrid and cerezo held two rounds of private talks friday 
in this caribbean resort on the yucatan peninsula 
mexicos own interests in central america are jeopardized by 
instability in the region de la madrid declared in the rare attack 
on his countrys northern neighbor 
mexico perceives the overflow of the central american conflict 
as a risk affecting its legitimate interests and provoking disorder 
and instability that threaten our institutions he said 
de la madrid referred to us financing of the contra rebels who 
have been fighting nicaraguas sandinista government for six years 
and the dispatch of 3200 american troops to honduras on march 17 
after an alleged incursion by nicaraguan troops chasing contra 
fighters 
military sources in honduras say the us troops are going home 
monday now that a sandinstacontra truce is holding with the two 
sides agreement wednesday to cease hostilities and seek to forge a 
lasting peace 
de la madrid also criticized us trade and economic sanctions 
against panama that are aimed at forcing the ouster of that 
countrys military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
stubbornness in imposing military options over diplomatic 
efforts is producing a conflict whose high costs in death and 
destruction we can neither tolerate nor view with indifference 
the president said 
de la madrid first voiced criticism of us policy in the region 
monday when he said it is not with the movement of troops nor 
with the financing of subversion from whatever origin that the 
problems of the area which is vital to the interests of the mexican 
people are resolved 
conflicts in central america stems from economic and social 
causes he said declaring that his nation would search for 
solutions that guarantee the legitimate interests of the region 
cerezo and de la madrid were scheduled to conclude their talks 
today

soviet space debris bigger than a railroad boxcar 
reentered the atmosphere in a brilliant atmospheric fireworks 
display friday night that triggered phone calls from curious 
skywatchers in three states officials said 
i saw a meteorite once that was pretty spectacular but this 
one just blew that away this was the most amazing celestial event 
ive ever seen said chuck farr 33 of round rock who watched 
from his front yard 
it was part of a package that was sent up a couple of days ago 
from the soviet union said lt col ivan pinnell a spokesman for 
the north american aerospace defense command or norad in colorado 
springs colo 
the object which was larger than a railroad boxcar 
reentered the atmosphere around 1050 pm cst pinnell said the 
chances of it causing any damage on the ground were highly 
improbable he said 
when an object like that reenters it breaks up in the 
atmosphere and you have these smaller pieces and sometimes you 
have quite a show pinnell said 
the reentry was seen in texas oklahoma and arkansas 
norad had been tracking the object by satellite he said 
we knew this was going to reenter but exactly where was hard 
to predict as far as the exact time and location he said 
most of the phone calls about the fiery reentry came from the 
houston and dallas areas but the object was seen as far away as 
little rock ark pinnell said 
bill hecke a retired air force meteorologist who operates a 
weather station from his home in moody 30 miles south of waco 
said the object looked like a meteorite to him 
it was closer and larger than anything ive ever seen anything 
before and ive been real active watching the skies since 1963 
hecke said 
he said he called a number of radio stations after the sighting 
and said it had been seen in lawton okla 
cars along interstate 35 pulled off the road to watch the 
fireworks said jim ribble a newsman for texas ap network radio 
who was driving on the interstate when he saw the reentry 
he said it looked like the sparks caused by a car whose muffler 
has come loose and is dragging along the roadway 
it just kept growing like a sparkler said farr a 
33yearold technical writer for texas instruments in austin it 
went across the entire sky

generations in south carolinas lowcountry is threatened by the 
modernday condominium 
booming coastal development of the past 20 years is reducing the 
availability of the sweetgrass favored by local artisans for the 
baskets a popular purchase for tourists folklorists said 
whats at stake is the continuation of this traditional 
african craft said myrtle glascoe director of the avery 
research center for afroamerican history at the college of 
charleston if people cant get the grass they wont continue to 
do the craft 
a conference on the problem was scheduled for today at the 
charleston museum basket weavers government officials historians 
and others were invited to attend 
weavers have seen their access to local sweetgrass decline in 
recent years and have been forced to buy it from as far away as 
florida 
its getting scarce said elizabeth fleming a basket weaver 
from nearby mount pleasant people are building condominiums all 
over and they dont want you to go on their property 
the preferred type of grass for the ornamental baskets 
muhlenbergia filipes generally grows in the sand beyond the dune 
line at the beach the area that has been developed extensively in 
recent years 
the grass is still there and certainly not all of it has been 
built over said dale rosengarten of the university of south 
carolinas mckissick museum in columbia but many of the areas in 
which it grows are restricted entry 
mrs fleming said that in addition to the access problem there 
seems to be less sweetgrass available in areas still open to 
gathering 
mrs fleming said she buys some of her grass from suppliers in 
florida but even that is not without problems once two men who 
supply her with the grass were arrested for gathering it she said 
some local artisans have resorted to making their baskets from 
bulrushes which arent as pliable or bright as sweetgrass 
you cant make a small basket with a bulrush because the 
bulrush wont bend as easily said mrs fleming who operates a 
family basket stand in mount pleasant which her grandmother 
operated before her 
mrs rosengarten said the economic impact of basket sales is 
probably slight but she said its hard to gauge their importance 
to charlestons tourism economy because visitors remember the 
historic city as one of pastel houses horsedrawn carriages and 
basket weavers 
mrs rosengarten said there are a number of things that can be 
done the charleston museum has a plot of land where officials hope 
to cultivate sweetgrass 
wed like to see the commercial nurseries carrying the grass 
and to see it used as an ornamental mrs rosengarten said we 
want people to be aware of the grass and what it is its great for 
holding the dune against erosion 
were trying to take action before its too late she added 
noting that if the sweetgrass becomes an endangered species no 
one including the basket weavers would be able to pick it

republican bob dole saying i can read the 
numbers admits his race for the white house is all but over as 
democrat richard gephardt faces the prospect that todays michigan 
caucuses could write the end to his campaign 
the democratic hopefuls searched michigan for every last vote 
friday with frontrunners michael dukakis and jesse jackson 
exhorting their backers to ignore the polls and make a final push 
for victory 
dukakis closed his campaign with a noisy gathering at a 
polishamerican center in detroit while jackson wrapped up his day 
with thunderous rallies across the state 
gephardt told supporters in a series of stops that he can pull 
off a stunning upset here despite showing some late strength the 
missouri congressman was still third in the polls and aides were 
talking about a race for reelection to his house seat 
we will pull off a miracle in michigan tomorrow gephardt 
told a crowd in taylor mich 
neither sen albert gore jr of tennessee nor fellow democratic 
contender sen paul simon of illinois had made significant 
organizational and advertising efforts in michigan both have spent 
more time in the upcoming primary states where they saw better 
chances for a breakthrough 
on the republican side dole stunned a washington audience with 
a frank admission that vice president george bush is almost 
certainly the republican nominee 
i can read the numbers and i know probably whats going to 
happen the kansas republican told reporters after the us 
chamber of commerce meeting 
i think its probably a foregone conclusion whats happening 
on the republican side dole told the group 
asked if he would continue until the wisconsin primary on april 
5 dole had this to say i may tell you that later this week 
probably next week 
but a spokesman was quick to deny that dole was conceding the 
race 
for his part bush said doles comments wont change any of his 
plans 
this doesnt say its over so im going to just keep going 
right down to the wire and not speculate on somebody elses 
campaign or on the democratic side he said after a campaign 
appearance in denver 
bush brushed aside questions about potential running mates as 
well 
its too early for me to start thinking about any running 
mates that would project a certain arrogance or presumption that i 
dont want to do 
in washington white house chief of staff howard h baker jr 
was asked on cable news networks evans amp novak if he would 
accept the vice presidency if bush turned to him 
baker said he did not believe he would be the choice but when 
pressed he said you know most of my adult life ive spent in 
public service and if someone asked me to do it i would have a 
very difficult time trying to figure out what i was going to say 
but i do not wish that to happen i do not think that will 
happen and i do not expect it 
the democratic spotlight was on michigan the latest in the 
series of bigstate primaries that may decide the partys 1988 
nominee 
dukakis leading in the delegate count for the nomination hoped 
his strength across the state would give him a large share of the 
135 delegates at stake as well as the popular vote victory the 
massachusetts governor making a joke about his heavy dark 
eyebrows asked his people to work hard in the final hours 
when you make those phone calls tonight and tomorrow and i 
hope you will because you know in caucuses particularly turnout is 
very important you just tell them to go with the guy with the 
eyebrows and well have a very good saturday he told the 
polishamerican century club in hamtramck mich 
at his side were mayor coleman young of detroit and sen don 
riegle 
in flint jackson named rivals dukakis and gore and said he was 
outspent 50to1 by them in the south yet we got the most votes 
if they had my budget they would surrender if i had their 
budget they could not compete he said 
later jackson spoke at a baptist church where the crowd was so 
large that people stood outside unable to get in 
gore began suggesting that the wisconsin primary on april 5 will 
be where he tries again to win one from dukakis and jackson who he 
suggested are more liberal than he in detroit gore took the 
opportunity of a question on his defense ideas to restate his claim 
to be the moderate among the democrats 
its not conservative ive never used that word let me 
hasten to add you dont have to be very far to the right to be to 
the right of this crowd he said 
dukakis held a slim lead over jackson in the ap delegate count 
with 54855 votes to 52055 for the civil rights leaders gore had 
3628 votes gephardt 154 and simon 1715 a total of 3546 votes 
are currently in the uncommitted column

on aug 25 1986 dorrians red hand was just 
another bar on manhattans upper east side catering to the young 
and upwardly mobile a hangout for yuppies and preppies where the 
izod crowd came to knock back a few 
twentyfour hours later all that changed 
with the death of jennifer dawn levin early on the morning of 
aug 26 dorrians became fairly or unfairly a symbol of 
youthful decadence of teenagers with too much money and no place 
to go 
among them was robert chambers jr who sat at the bar drinking 
shots of tequila with beer chasers the night he killed miss levin 
he fouled everybodys life up bar owner john f jack 
dorrian said recently who needs this guy 
after miss levins death investigators returned to dorrians 
and closed the bar for 10 days for serving underage patrons in 
november 1986 dorrian has put the bar up for sale no buyer has 
been found 
chambers now 21 had been a regular at dorrians he also was a 
college dropout who had a very proper upbringing 
dinner at the chambers house located next to the former andrew 
carnegie mansion a few blocks north of dorrians always had 
silver involved said ralph destino a friend of chambers 
shortly after chambers arrest 
chambers apparently had no steady job at the time of his arrest 
yet was drinking and flirting five or six nights a week at 
dorrians said its owner 
interviews in the months since the slaying indicate that 
dorrians remains attractive a place where young people can gather 
in front of an ornate fireplace and play backgammon at the tables 
regulars said they avoided dorrians after miss levin died 
fearing the bar had been taken over by the curious but the young 
men and women who grew up in the wealthy neighborhood and knew one 
another in the best prep schools came back 
miss levin was not a regular at dorrians but was known there 
patrons dont talk much about the case they said 
i come here when i feel like sitting around like im in my 
living room said alyssa donati 21 who said she has been 
frequenting dorrians for five years 
dorrian himself knows whos who in the bar he can point out the 
child of a wellknown writer and the daughter of a presidential 
adviser john zaccaro jr son of exdemocratic vice presidential 
nominee geraldine ferraro was tending bar the night of the death 
chambers would no longer be welcome dorrian said other 
regulars would say tourists outoftowners and the curious are not 
welcome either 
parents like their kids to come here miss donati said 
here they know the people are from at least good families 
theyve been to good colleges and theyre not out to rape people

gov evan mecham defending himself 
against charges he misused 80000 from a protocol fund said he 
was never told it was public money and was given carte blanche to 
do nearly anything he wanted with it 
mecham testified at his senate impeachment trial friday that 
when the proceeds of his inaugural ball were converted into a 
protocol fund nobody questioned whether it should be considered 
public money instead of private 
mecham taking the stand for the second time in his trial said 
inaugural committee chairman bill long told him weve gone 
through all of this rigamarole in determining that the inaugural 
funds could not be used to pay off campaign debts 
mecham said long told him you can spend it for any damn 
thing you want those are his words except you cant spend it 
for politics or for personal living expenses 
mecham is accused of misusing 80000 from the 92000 protocol 
fund by loaning it to his car dealership mecham pontiac 
the governor is scheduled to resume testifying monday 
mecham has testified on the first charge against him that he 
tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a 
state employee 
the senate plans to begin hearing testimony next week on the 
third charge that mecham concealed a 350000 campaign loan 
mecham 63 also faces a recall election may 17 and an april 21 
criminal trial on six felony charges of hiding the 350000 loan 
the prosecution contends the protocol fund was state money and 
that mecham pontiac needed the loan to meet its july payroll a 
prosecution witness testified earlier this week that the dealership 
had about 37 million in loans against an appraised value of 335 
million 
prosecutors have said mecham tried to conceal the 80000 loan 
mecham and his 37yearold son dennis who has been the 
dealerships general manager since his father ran for governor in 
1986 sought to paint a rosier financial picture 
dennis mecham said he borrowed the money simply because his 
father offered it in an effort to get a higher interest rate for 
the protocol fund he said he could always use additional capital 
in an effort to generate more profits 
the rumor mill has been rampant about mecham pontiac since day 
one weve had our lives every scrap of it demonstrated to our 
competitors and god and his angels the younger mecham said 
defense attorney jerris leonard led the governor through a 
series of calculations that he said showed that mecham pontiac had 
25 million worth of unencumbered property 
later leonard told reporters the numbers are obvious there 
was at least 25 million worth of real estate value behind an 
80000 loan ill take that deal anytime 
however the governor acknowledged that in july 1987 the same 
month the 80000 loan was made he was notified that he was 
behind on repaying a 101905 loan from valley national bank 
quite frankly i wasnt watching my details mecham said 
i was a little redfaced when this caught up with me he said 
he paid part of the loan and refinanced the rest in a transaction 
handled by telephone 
a twothirds vote of the 30member senate is required to convict 
mecham and lawmakers also could decide to bar him from holding any 
future office mecham is the first us governor to be impeached in 
six decades

whose vision created the joffrey ballet and made it one of the 
nations foremost dance companies has died after a lengthy 
illness he was 57 
joffrey died early friday at new york university medical center 
of liver kidney and respiratory failure hospital spokeswoman 
terrie locicero said 
as artistic director of the joffrey ballet for three decades 
joffrey guided the troupe from its early days as a struggling 
sixmember company traveling in a borrowed station wagon to 
international acclaim 
robert joffrey brought an unbridled passion for ballet in 
every form to our profession said mikhail baryshnikov artistic 
director of the american ballet theater 
his love of the heritage of ballet was an inspiration to 
everyone baryshnikov said he was also committed to seeking 
out new choreographers and often was not afraid to put the most 
untried choreographers on a ballet stage for the first time we 
salute his taste and his ingenuity 
the joffrey ballet appearing in chicago dedicated friday 
nights performance to its founder 
joffrey became ill in april 1986 he was diagnosed as having 
severe myositis which causes deterioration of the muscles 
enlarged liver and asthma medication that he was receiving for 
asthma and the muscle condition caused his fatal liver ailment 
hospital spokeswoman pennie curry said 
because of his asthma a doctor had recommended that joffrey 
take up dancing as a 9yearold to improve his health 
joffrey was born abdullah jaffa anver bey khan in seattle on 
dec 24 1930 the son of an italian mother and an afghan father 
he started dance classes in seattle also studied at the school 
of american ballet in new york and studied with two moderndance 
teachers 
his short performance career began with a solo concert of his 
own works in seattle he danced with roland petits ballets de 
paris in 1949 from 1950 to 1952 he sometimes danced in the concert 
group of one of his teachers may odonnell 
the robert joffrey ballet concert performed at a new york ymha 
in 1954 but joffrey dated the founding of his company to 1956 
when he taught six dancers four pieces he had choreographed and 
sent them on an 11state tour in a borrowed station wagon 
within 10 years of that tour the joffrey ballet had performed 
at the white house in the soviet union and the far east 
the joffrey now ranks with the new york city ballet and american 
ballet theater as one of americas big three ballet companies 
he had a passion and a love for dance he loved to bring dance 
to parts of the world that had never seen it said gary chryst a 
member of the joffrey troupe for 11 years and one of its bestknown 
dancers 
robert joffrey was one of a handful of artists who made their 
personal visions into a public statement the company he started 
will continue to bring that vision to audiences all over america 
said charles b raymond managing director of the new york city 
ballet 
among joffreys accomplishments was his recreation of vaslov 
nijinskys 1913 the rite of spring joffrey engaged two dance 
historians to recreate the ballet danced only eight times 
previously it premiered in september 1987 in los angeles 
his own ballets include the nutcracker in 1987 and his 
striking 1967 astarte in which a couple dance in front of a

the nations largest opposition 
coalition praised the sandinistacontra peace accord but assailed 
the governments pact to negotiate political reform with a small 
segment of the opposition 
in other developments friday the sandinista governments 
newspaper barricada said citizens should now prepare for 
ideological warfare and the ussupported contra rebels indicated 
they would resume fighting if reconciliation talks dont achieve 
greater political freedom 
the defense ministry said a 5dayold ceasefire appeared to be 
holding 
the nicaraguan democratic coordinate a coalition of four 
leading political parties two labor unions and professional and 
business organizations said wednesdays peace accord represented 
positive advances to obtain real and effective peace in 
nicaragua 
but the coalition rejected the national dialogue agreement 
the leftist government signed two days earlier with eight smaller 
political parties not affiliated with the coordinate 
in a statement it called the agreement contrary to the 
interest of the people of nicaragua in their efforts to promote 
democratization and freedom 
by signing the pact the sandinistas sought to separate 
negotiations on democratic reform from talks with the contras the 
coordinate said 
the sandinistas and contras agreed wednesday to maintain their 
ceasefire until june 1 hoping negotiations to begin april 6 in 
managua will by then have forged a lasting peace 
the contras agreed not to accept any more us military aid 
under the agreement reached in the southern border town of 
sapoa the sandinistas promised a gradual amnesty and unrestricted 
freedom of expression that would allow the contras a role in 
nicaraguas political process 
but the contras future political role is unclear and that 
concerns the coordinate under the sapoa agreement up to eight 
contra leaders would be allowed to participate in the socalled 
national dialogue 
ramiro gurdian coordinate vice president said he hoped contras 
will begin a tripartite dialogue with the government and the 
coordinate 
the national dialogue begun in october with 15 opposition 
parties reached an impasse two months later when the government 
refused to discuss opposition proposals for modifying a new 
constitution that went into effect in january 
carlos huembes president of the coordinate said friday that 
domestic economic and political pressures as well as international 
opinion had forced the sandinistas to the negotiating table 
we all know about the decomposition and lack of political 
pluralism existing in nicaragua we all know and understand the 
economic crisis the sandinista government is foundering in and the 
lack of international credibility and aid that the sandinista front 
has lost he said 
barricada said in an editorial that the ceasefire agreement 
means the 6yearold civil war will enter a new phase on an 
internal political level this means the incorporation of pressure 
groups that even though disarmed continue to be armed 
ideologically against the popular power and its conquests 
jorge rosales a contra spokesman in miami indicated that if 
democracy is not achieved through the sapoa accords the contras 
could renew their armed fight if we cant do it peacefully if 
the sandinsitas do not want to achieve democracy then the reasons 
nicaraguans took up arms will still be there 
carlos huembes president of the coordinate said friday that 
domestic economic and political pressures as well as international 
opinion had forced the sandinistas to the negotiating table 
we all know about the decomposition and lack of political 
pluralism existing in nicaragua we all know and understand the

while the woman who crossed an ocean to see him lies comatose says 
he hopes they still can have a life together 
im scared out of my wits daniel stokes 21 said in a 
telephone interview friday from the cook county jail where he is 
being held on a murder charge that could bring the death penalty if 
he is convicted 
margaret hanley who flew from her home in ireland to see stokes 
in jail remains in a coma at weiss memorial hospital after being 
hit by a car on st patricks day she is in critical condition 
i hope that one day i should walk away from this and make a 
life for both of us stokes said 
stokes and miss hanley met in august 1987 when stokes returned 
to ireland from chicago where his mother lives and he lived 
briefly 
miss hanley 22 was an actress for stokes father a theater 
company owner in dublin stokes said thats where their love story 
began 
i met her the very day i got off the plane she was over at my 
house she came over on her tea break because she and my sister are 
best friends stokes recalled 
romance was in the air he said we got very serious after 
a couple of weeks we found that we were very compatible 
but stokes a cabinetmaker found hard economic times in dublin 
so he returned to chicago in november 
on dec 29 stokes was charged with bludgeoning his landlord to 
death in the mans apartment said lisa howard a spokeswoman for

jail but wanted to help him he said 
she wrote him letters saying that no matter what she wanted 
to be there for me stokes said 
their reunion at the jail was very emotional he said i 
think she was more or less speechless 
i was delighted i was overwhelmed because it proved something 
to me that a woman willing to travel 1000 miles to see me must 
be worth keeping

was hard for miss hanley to accept 
she called her family telling them she planned to return home

the united nations will send a team of 
experts to iran next week to examine victims of poison gas attacks 
blamed on iraq that killed thousands of people 
iran said the chemical attacks have been aimed at kurdish rebels 
in a portion of northeastern iraq claims to have captured a 
kurdish leader asked friday for medical aid for the victims 
in a related development friday irans un ambassador 
mohammad jaafar mahallati said tehran would send a special 
emissary to the united nations for talks on seeking an end to the 
7yearold iraniraq war 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar had requested the 
talks and the un decision to send the team to iran was an 
apparent compromise 
earlier friday mahallati had accused the united nations of 
footdragging on irans request for a un mission to investigate 
allegations iraq used chemical weapons on kurdish rebels in 
violation of international agreements 
he had indicated that lack of action on the request could lead 
to delays in reaching a ceasefire as called for in a july 
resolution passed by the un security council 
it means if the united nations remains inactive regarding all 
aspects of the war a political solution would be more and more 
difficult mahallati told a news conference 
a kurdish rebel leader appealed for urgent medical aid for 
kurdish villagers he said were affected by iraqi poison gas attacks 
this week 
the situation is getting desperate as we do not have any 
facilities to cope said a statement issued by the office of 
massud barzanis kurdish democratic party in london 
the statement claimed at least 50 kurdish villagers were killed 
and scores wounded in the last such chemical weapons attack 
thursday when iraqi planes bombed seyo and senan villages in 
northeastern iraq 
the villages are near halabja where iran said 5000 kurds died 
last week after an alleged iraqi air raid with internationally 
banned poison gas bombs 
after lateafternoon consultations with perez de cuellar 
mahallati announced that the expert mission would arrive in iran on 
monday and an iranian emissary would meet with the 
secretarygeneral in new york 
the united nations had been hesitant to send a team to the scene 
of the purported attack because it is in iraqi territory now held 
by iran baghdad has not granted permission for such a mission to 
visit its territory 
the united nations has investigated and condemned iraq for using 
chemical weapons in previous years but those incidents occurred on 
iranian territory 
perez de cuellar said iraq agreed to send a special envoy for 
talks april 45 mahallati would not say when the iranian emissary 
would meet with the secretarygeneral 
francois giuliani perez de cuellars spokesman confirmed the 
twoperson team including a doctor will be sent to iran to see 
chemical attack victims 
iraq claims iran was responsible was the gas attacks but perez 
de cuellar said friday that it appeared baghdad was at fault 
sadly there is considerable and most serious evidence in the 
public domain that chemical weapons have again been used by iraqi 
forces in the past few days causing a high number of casualties 
including civilians of both iran and iraq he said in a statement 
massud barzanis party and the patriotic union of kurdistan have 
been fighting the iraqi government with iranian support in recent 
years seeking autonomy for the 35 million iraqi kurds 
iraq has been condemned by the united nations on four previous 
occasions since 1984 for using chemical weapons in its war with 
iran

contra leader adolfo calero says the newly signed 
ceasefire pact with the sandinistas is an acid test of the 
nicaraguan governments sincerity and the rebels will keep their 
weapons just in case 
were not signing off any leverage any power calero said 
friday on his return from sapoa nicaragua where the pact was 
signed 
were keeping our weapons he said we arent simply 
letting things develop any other way except the way theyre 
signed 
calero one of three top rebels who signed the preliminary peace 
accord wednesday in hopes of ending the bitter sevenyear civil 
war acknowledged his skepticism toward the sandinista government 
we feel this is the acid test that will bring the sandinistas 
to the moment of truth calero said if they dont comply it 
will be very difficult for anyone to believe them 
we have the right to break this accord if they dont comply 
he said 
president reagan and nicaraugan exiles living in miami have 
expressed doubt that nicaraguas marxistled government will live 
up to the agreement some exiles have criticized the rebel 
leadership for negotiating the truce 
silvio arguello cardenal a former vice president of nicaragua 
told the miami herald it would be political suicide for the 
rebels to turn in their weapons before the country was fully 
democratic 
there is no guarantee just a sandinista promise cardenal 
said 
calero said the decision to sign the agreement was one that had 
to be made whether or not the exiles favored it 
this is a good decision he told a news conference at miami 
international airport we had the courage to make it and 
strength to make sure that if it fails we can hold our own 
the nicaraguan resistance a contra umbrella group was 
completely behind the agreement calero said 
i think all this talk on the local radio stations that weve 
sold out to the sandinistas i dont think we have said contra 
spokeswoman marta sacasa some exiles dont really understand the 
situation well 
the resistance assembly which regularly meets to discuss 
developments began a threeday closeddoor conference here friday 
and planned to review the ninepoint agreement signed with the

gov bob martinez wants to develop 
americas first commercial spaceport here but the project faces a 
number of hurdles and an uncertain future 
martinez said friday that he will ask the legislature next week 
for 500000 for a feasibility study of the project called 
spaceport florida 
he was vague about how the spaceport would be developed and 
operated saying only that we feel with the money we can acquire 
the necessary consultation and advice 
if the legislature approves the money part of a supplemental 
budget request the state department of commerce will seek bids on 
a feasibility study that would begin in july 
however legislative leaders already have warned they expect 
difficulty finding money for new programs in the 1988 session 
beginning april 5 
the governor spoke friday to about 80 aerospace executives and 
legislative leaders outside the space museum at the cape canaveral 
air force station 
martinez said the facilities at cape canaveral and the adjacent 
kennedy space center give florida a clear advantage over hawaii and 
other states contemplating developing facilities for commercial 
launches 
we have the tracking systems the launch pads the support 
services and most importantly we have the people to make spaceport 
florida a reality he said 
asked how a commercial customer would benefit from going to 
spaceport florida rather than dealing directly with a rocket maker 
as is done now martinez replied maybe our role is to provide 
the opportunities for the companies to do business 
we could guarantee them a launch date months in advance he 
added 
before reporters could ask how he cut off questioning 
the national aeronautics and space administration and the air 
force have launch pad priority it is doubtful spaceport florida 
could guarantee a launch date unless it builds its own launch pads 
control centers and tracking facilities an expensive undertaking 
all launch facilities in the united states are controlled by the 
federal government and commercial payloads such as communications 
satellites have to compete for rocket space with nasa and defense 
department launches 
us launches have been scarce since the space shuttle 
challenger and two major unmanned rockets exploded in 1986 this 
has created a huge backlog of payloads and the military and nasa 
will have priority when shuttle flights resume now scheduled for 
august 
the united states is building a new family of unmanned rockets 
but these are also heavly booked by the pentagon nasa and 
commercial customers dealing directly with rocket makers 
many american companies are seeking launch services from the 
europeans and japanese but those launch pads also are crowded 
because of the backlog of commercial payloads there is a 
great demand in the private sector for launch facilities 
martinez said 
our goal is to launch one commercial mission each month from 
spaceport florida he said at the current rate of 45 million 
per launch this would directly inject 540 million per year into 
our states economy 
he predicted the spaceport also would attract much of the 
private sector space industry which he projected would be worth 
60 billion by the end of the century

chinas finance minister says the governments 
712 billion budget will run a multibilliondollar deficit for a 
third straight year despite plans to impose new taxes issue more 
treasury bonds and slash spending 
and in a speech today vice premier yao yilin warned the 
national peoples congress that wining and dining and giving 
gifts out of public funds have become a bane to society 
finance minister wang bingqian addressing the congress friday 
said chinas deficit in 1988 will be 8 billion yuan 22 billion 
the same as in 1987 and up slightly from 1986 
wang urged greater controls over government taxing and finances 
saying tax evasion withholding of profits extortion and doctored 
accounts have led to loss of an enormous amount of state revenue 
and also sabotaged party policies and principles 
he said substantial revenues are needed as china transforms its 
socialist economy to a more marketoriented model and strives for 
rapid economic growth 
it therefore will be hard to eliminate the deficit within the 
next two or three years wang said speaking on the second day of 
the annual congress which is chinas legislature 
in his speech friday acting premier li peng stressed that china 
must make greater efforts to control inflation and increase 
agricultural production as it forges ahead with economic reforms 
wang said state revenues rose 6 percent in 1987 to 634 billion 
while expenditures also rose 6 percent to 656 billion the draft 
budget for 1988 calls for revenues of 69 billion 
he said 35 billion in revenues will come from foreign loans 
up from 28 billion in 1987 and that increased revenues will also 
be sought by imposing a new tax on land use in urban areas in 
addition state treasury bonds worth 24 billion will be issued 
811 million more than last year 
wang said the government will continue to suppress spending on 
capital construction and hold down administrative costs steps 
taken after overall spending jumped 201 percent in 1985 
he said the state will substantially boost spending in 
agriculture up 146 percent in 1988 to 42 billion 
officials have stressed the need for more investment in rural 
areas following several years of listless grain production and a 
trend among individual farmers to use profits to build houses and 
buy tvs rather than further develop their land 
the budget for capital construction is slated to fall about 45 
percent to 171 billion education science and public health is 
to receive 12 billion up 15 percent and defense is allotted 58 
billion up 5 percent 
yao who also heads the state planning commission asked 
highspending officials to remember china is as yet very 
underdeveloped economically with numerous tasks to undertake and 
inadequate funds and materials 
he outlined four goals for 1988 topped by the promotion of 
agriculture production 
yao said china will continue to reform its pricing system so 
that prices now kept artificially low by government subsidies 
better reflect market values local authorities will provide direct 
subsidies to workers to help compensate for price rises of those 
foodstuffs that are rationed he said 
the second goal is building up the nations infrastructure to 
provide the materials and energy now often in short supply needed 
for expanding industries 
third he said more emphasis will be put on improving science 
and technology levels as well as the education system 
finally the government should back the proposal put forth by 
party chief zhao ziyang to open up coastal regions for 
exportoriented industries 
yao said the government will set up national investment 
corporations to better monitor projects and reform chinas foreign 
trade system to make it more responsive to the international market 
yao predicted the gross national product which topped 270 
billion in 1987 will grow by 75 percent in 1988 agricultural 
production will rise 4 percent and industrial output by 8 percent 
he said 
he did not estimate the inflation rate which has run at 
doubledigit levels in the past year but said incomes will be 
slightly higher than last year after adjustments for price rises

bogota colombia two and a half years after killing 23000 
people a volcano rumbled back to life sending ash miles upward 
spewing fresh lava and forcing the evacuation of hundreds of 
farmers from surrounding hillsides 
the nevada del ruiz volcanos activity had stabilized by friday 
night and there appeared to be little immediate danger of a major 
eruption said eduardo parra director of colombias volcano 
institute in manizales 
the evacuations are for avoiding any ugly surprises he said 
in a communique 
airline pilots reported seeing steam and ash rising to 28000 
feet above the volcano the colombian civil aeronautics 
administration said 
about 1900 people in the villages of libano murillo and 
palestina all on the volcanos western slope were being moved out 
friday night the governments national emergency committee said in 
a communique 
before dark friday about 600 people living on farms on the 
sides of the volanco were evacuated the emergency committee said 
the volcano institute upgraded its alert at nightfall friday 
advising people living along rivers up to 20 miles away to be ready 
to flee if the volcano erupts 
an estimated 50000 people live within a 15mile radius of the 
volcano in what is considered the danger zone if there is a major 
eruption 
the andes seismological institute in bogota said it was 
recording almost constant tremors but none strong enough to 
register on the richter scale 
the river danger zones were established by a national emergency 
committee after the devastating nov 13 1985 eruption they 
includes the rivers guali lagunilla azufrado recio and sabandija 
to the east of the volcano and the chinchinica river to the west 
residents of honda 20 miles northeast of the volcano and at the 
confluence of the guali and magdalena rivers suspended their 
annual fishing festival 
the dancing parades parties and heavy drinking mark the 
movement of millions of fish up rivers to spawn a boon to 
fishermen 
sight of the awesome column of steam and ash sobered up many 
revelers the rcn radio network said 
about a quarterinch of ash covered the town of manizales about 
20 miles to the northwest of the volcano rcn reported manizales 
is not considered to be in danger because it is outside the 
flooding zones 
fridays volcanic activity was the highest since the 1985 
eruption when melting glaciers on the volcano created flooding 
that left trees boulders and other debris blocking the lagunilla 
river on the western slope 
the blockage burst and a 10storyhigh wall of mud roared down 
the river canyon burst onto a plain and wiped out the town of 
armero in seconds

president eisenhower considered dropping nuclear 
bombs on communist china in the 1950s to defend the nationalist 
chinese islands of quemoy and matsu a historian says 
eisenhower actually brought the country to the nuclear 
brink far closer to war than a distraught public feared in 
1955 said gordon h chang a historian at the international 
strategic institute at stanford university 
chang citing declassified documents made the comment in an 
article for the spring issue of the harvard universitybased 
journal international security 
the possibility of using nuclear weapons was indeed 
considered said a former senior counselor to eisenhower 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the president was definitely considering this alternative 
the former official said friday the use that was discussed was 
of small nuclear weapons to be used against mainland airbases which 
were close enough to quemoy and matsu to provide air cover 
the official said the tentative plan called for several atomic 
bombs of 10 to 15 kilotons each about the yield of the bomb that 
destroyed the japanese city of hiroshima to be dropped on the 
coastal air bases whiche were in populated areas 
eisenhower and key aides were aware that civilian casualties 
could number in the millions from such attacks the official said 
consideration of a nuclear attack began little more than a year 
after eisenhower conditionally approved a plan in may 1953 to end 
the lingering korean war with a fullscale military attack that 
might have included the use of atomic weapons against the chinese 
when the chinese began shelling quemoy in september 1954 acting 
secretary of defense robert anderson alerted eisenhower that the 
intensity of the attack on the nationalist chineseheld island 
seemed to herald an allout assault 
over the next nine months the united states in support of 
the nationalists defense of these islands lurched toward 
disaster chang wrote 
but the communist chinese unexpectedly defused tensions on 
april 23 1955 premier zhou enlai announced that his government 
was willing to negotiate with the united states on the reduction of 
tensions in the taiwan area 
chang in a telephone interview from palo alto calif said 
much of his article was based on material declassified in the last 
two or three years 
he cited an excerpt that he said records the substance of a 
march 28 1955 discussion between secretary of state john foster 
dulles and robert bowie head of eisenhowers policy planning staff 
mr bowie advanced the idea that we might serve notice that if 
the chicoms chinese communists took quemoy and matsu we would in 
future from time to time drop a bomb on them in order to 
neutralize them and give the chicoms no advantage by their 
capture the excerpt said 
the secretary disagreed saying that this would be a 
considerable waste of armament and we would accomplish nothing but 
the killing of a number of harmless fishermen whom the chicoms 
would put on the island in such an event it said

deliberations in the preppie murder trial 
stalled because the jury could not agree on robert chambers jrs 
state of mind at the time of the killing a juror says 
chambers who could have been convicted of seconddegree murder 
pleaded guilty friday to firstdegree manslaughter in the aug 26 
1986 death of jennifer dawn levin bringing those deliberations to 
a halt on their ninth day 
manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau said the prospect 
of a possible mistrial the strain on the levin family and 
circumstantial evidence prompted him to agree to the plea bargain 
there was one critical issue that kept swaying people back and 
forth that issue was understanding the concept of operation of the 
mind juror mike ognibene said after chambers entered his plea 
we had the facts wed put it all together the only thing 
lacking was what was going on in his mind at the time ognibene 
said 
jury forewoman debra cavanaugh said the panel was frustrated by 
the amount of circumstantial evidence 
both sides proved their points both sides stories could be 
true she said 
morganthau said three jurors sent notes to the judge saying they 
could not go on 
a prosecution source who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
black juror thought a couple of the other jurors were racists 
a woman juror was concerned because she had been scheduled to begin 
a new job on march 1 and the third just wanted out 
the jurys vote swung from 84 for acquittal to 93 for 
conviction and ended up 75 for acquittal on the seconddegree 
murder charge ognibene said 
this was the most incredible experience of my life and i am 
satisfied the jury system works he told reporters who mobbed him

jack paladino is going all the way to 
iowa for people to pump gas and check oil at the exxon station he 
manages in affluent greenwich conn 
we just cant find anybody to pump gas out here paladino 
said in a telephone interview from greenwich this week we 
already have three or four people from iowa and hes advertising 
in iowa newspapers for more 
this weekend an employee of paladinos will be in iowa city and 
cedar rapids to interview some of the 50 people who have submitted 
job applications in response to the ads 
the process already has led to a job for tony moran of van 
horne who replied several weeks ago to an ad in the cedar rapids 
gazette 
the ad promised terms unheard of for similar work in iowa we 
offer 305 a week free housing and benefits plus free flight 
out 
this seeming generosity paladino explained stems from a severe 
shortage of people willing to take service jobs in the highincome 
greenwich area 
its so bad here that the fastfood places have vans so they 
can bus people out here from new york city he said some of 
those jobs pay 6 to 8 an hour 
because of the labor shortage paladino placed newspaper ads in 
upstate new york pennsylvania and iowa where hed heard 
unemployment rates were high 
weve had better response from iowa he said 
moran 20 is enthusiastic about his new job 
its working out great here he said its everything i 
expected i was excited by the idea of living close to new york i 
like the idea of working with cars i like the pay i like the 
apartment

international business machines corp offered to 
sell important computer chip technology to a major us competitor 
because it feared american electronics companies were relying too 
much on japanese technology a newspaper reported today 
ibm made the offer last year to digital equipment corp in an 
effort to keep digital from becoming more dependent on japanese 
suppliers the new york times reported citing a forthcoming book 
and sources in the industry 
the book titled trading places how we allowed japan to take 
the lead did not elaborate on what technology was offered or 
whether digital accepted the offer 
the book was written by clyde prestowitz and is scheduled for 
publication in late april the times said 
prestowitz formerly the commerce departments chief trade 
negotiator with japan wrote that in mid1987 ibm approached 
digital its most dangerous domestic rival and offered to 
transfer certain key technologies 
at first dec suspected a trick then it realized the objective 
was to prevent dec from falling even further into japanese hands 
prestowitz wrote 
the book said ibm apparently believes the entire american 
electronics industry could be weakened by growing dependence on 
japanese semiconductor technology 
spokesmen for ibm and digital would not confirm whether such 
talks occurred but other industry sources who declined to be 
identified verified that ibm had made such an offer the newspaper

dont know where theyre shooting sen alan lasee asked during 
debate friday night as much as i have empathy for the visually 
handicapped i dont believe i can support this

an automobile parked off a highway and more than 50 feet from the 
center of a roadway he said 
the bill extends eligibility for a special permit to people who 
present medical evidence that they are unable to hunt alone because 
of a permanent physical disability or handicap including blindness

part of a rocket launched by the soviet union to 
resupply its manned space station reentered the atmosphere over 
san antonio lighting up the sky with celestial fireworks seen in 
three states officials said 
the rocket burned up on reentry around 1050 pm friday 
blazing its way across the texas sky from southwest to northeast in 
a light show visible for more than a minute in texas arkansas and 
oklahoma 
radio stations police and the national weather service in fort 
worth said they were besieged by calls from curious skywatchers 
i saw a meteorite once that was pretty spectacular but this 
one just blew that away this was the most amazing celestial event 
ive ever seen said chuck farr 33 of round rock who watched 
from his front yard 
although the rocket was bigger than a railroad boxcar it was 
unlikely that it caused any damage on the ground said lt col 
ivan pinnell a spokesman for the north american air defense 
command or norad in colorado springs colo 
pinnell said the rocket was used to launch a cargo satellite 
carrying food and other supplies to the mir space station manned by 
two cosmonauts 
the soviet union launched the progress 35 satellite thursday 
according to a report by the soviet news agency tass pinnell said 
norad had been tracking the rocket since its launch and had 
expected the reentry but had not known when or where 
the reference book soviet military power lists the sl4 as 
the type of rocket normally used by soviets to launch such a 
payload pinnell said 
the sl4 weighs about 720000 pounds and is about 91 feet long 
pinnell said citing the march 1988 issue of aviation week and 
space technology 
when an object like that reenters it breaks up in the 
atmosphere and you have these smaller pieces and sometimes you 
have quite a show pinnell said 
he said he didnt know if the supplies had made it to the space 
station were on their way or burned up on reentry i would 
have to refer you to tass the spokesman said 
in moscow the soviet news agency tass reported that the 
progress 35 cargo spacecraft carrying food fuel mail and 
equipment docked with the mir space station today there was no 
mention of the rocket reentry 
bill hecke a retired air force meteorologist who operates a 
weather station from his home in moody 30 miles south of waco 
said the object looked like a meteorite to him 
it was closer and larger than anything ive ever seen anything 
before and ive been real active watching the skies since 1963 
hecke said 
motorists on interstate 35 south of waco pulled over to the side 
of the highway to watch the fireworks said jim ribble a newsman 
for texas ap network radio 
ribble said it looked like the sparks caused by a car dragging a 
loose muffler on the road 
it just kept growing like a sparkler said farr a 
33yearold technical writer for texas instruments in austin 
it went across the entire sky he said it took from 45 to 
75 seconds it gave me enough time to yell to the kids and they 
saw it too

suzuki motor co may continue to import its tiny 
samurai sportutility vehicle as a truck rather than a car because 
it enters the country without back seats the us customs service 
has ruled 
i dont like making any decision which seems illogical this 
decision doesnt make any sense when people see how these vehicles 
are being used in the united states but in this case the customs 
service has no choice said customs commissioner william von raab 
these are trucks under the law when they enter this 
country he said in announcing the decision friday 
suzukis samurais are imported into the united states as trucks 
because suzuki doesnt have a large enough allocation under the 
japanese governments voluntary export restraints to ship them as 
cars or sportutility vehicles 
instead of paying a 25 percent car tariff suzuki pays a 25 
percent truck tariff on each of the vehicles which are shipped 
without back seats to qualify as trucks 
rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at 
dealerships few of the small jeeplike vehicles are sold without 
rear seats suzuki sold 81349 samurais in this country in 1987 and 
said it plans to sell 100000 this year 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the us house energy 
and commerce committee criticized von raabs decision 
it appears that customs is still winking at the fact that the 
japanese are shipping seats into the us separately then 
installing them here to evade both customs laws and the voluntary 
export restraints he said 
last year customs and commerce department officials said the 
us government had little interest in helping the japanese 
government enforce its export limits particularly since federal 
government takes in more money when a maker opts to pay the 25 
percent tariff instead of the lower fee 
other japanese companies that follow suzukis practice include 
nissan motor corp isuzu motor corp mitsubishi motors corp and 
toyota motor corp the companies said last year

riot police backed by water cannons beat 
and arrested hundreds of roman catholics in western czechoslovakia 
who staged a rare demonstration for religious freedom western 
reporters said today 
about 2000 people in the slovak capital of bratislava gathered 
friday night in front of the national theater for a candlelight 
rally banned by communist authorities who tightly control 
religious activities 
witnesses said authorities broke up the demonstration by pushing 
into side streets protesters who had been singing slovak and czech 
national anthems praying and holding candles 
hundreds of people were arrested and many were beaten by police 
including some journalists reporters said 
there is growing discontent among catholics at authorities 
refusal to agree to vatican candidates to fill 10 vacant 
bishoprics no new czechoslovak bishops have been named since 1973 
and the three alive are all over 75 
jan cernogursky who helped organize the rally said in a 
telephone interview from bratislava that if there were similar 
protests in future then the government will no longer be able to 
freely decide over the heads of the citizens 
it was a new form of civil protest in this country after 40 
years because a previously announced demonstration of citizens 
has practically never taken place here before he told austrian 
radio 
the massive police turnout and violent action to disperse the 
crowd appeared designed to discourage opposition by catholics 
430000 of whom are said to have so far signed a petition for 
religious freedom and the appointment of bishops and priests 
otto hoermann of austrian state television orf said his crew was 
dragged away by policemen who appeared drunk and taken to police 
headquarters for 2 hours two other orf journalists were held for 
eight hours a team of the west german ard tv network also was 
detained 
hoermann said he saw scores of people drenched by water cannon 
lined up at police headquarters with their faces to the wall the 
exact number of arrests could not be determined 
bratislava is near the austrian border 40 miles east of vienna 
negotiations between the government and a vatican delegation in 
prague in january were inconclusive largely because the holy see 
refused to agree to candidates belonging to the progovernment 
pacem in terris organization of clergymen which is banned by the 
vatican 
the talks are scheduled to resume in rome next month 
the 31point petition being signed by hundreds of thousands of 
catholics nationwide an unprecedented manifestation of 
catholicism in the soviet bloc has made authorities increasingly 
nervous 
it calls for more bishops more priests and separation of church 
and state as well as the right to question marxist dogma and to 
petition authorities without harassment 
the petitions author augustin navratil was arrested earlier 
this month and charged with committing slander of a state organ 
and of a public organization which carries a term of up to one 
year imprisonment 
frantisek miklosko a slovak catholic activist had announced 
the rally to authorities on behalf of several faithful fellow 
citizens and organizers expected up to 70000 participants 
but authorities on thursday issued a ban saying the planned 
demonstration was an event guided from abroad that was directed 
against the socialist system

armenias capital of yerevan was like a dead 
city today as residents pressing for annexation of a disputed 
region of neighboring azerbaijan stayed home to protest a crackdown 
on activism dissidents reported 
soldiers and police with attack dogs were the only people on the 
streets while army helicopters hovered over the city of 14 
million said andrei bavitsky of the dissident journal glasnost 
quoting sources there 
thousands of azerbaijani police in stepanakert capital of the 
disputed nagornokarabahk region kept a tight hold on the city and 
armenian residents there also stayed home in protest bavitsky 
said quoting sources in that city armenians account for more than 
three quarters of the 160000 residents of nagornokarabakh 
four vocal leaders of the annexation campaign were arrested in 
yerevan friday after police ordered the dissolution of a committee 
organizing the quest for armenian control of nagornokarabakh 
both bavitsky and alexander ogorodnikov a christian rights 
activist said they were told by contacts in yerevan that armenians 
had decided to protest a clampdown on public demonstrations by 
refusing to go out of their apartments for the weekend they said 
the silent protest was being adhered to by virtually the entire 
city 
there are no children outside no cars on the street no 
activity whatsoever except for the troops occupying the city 
ogorodnikov said yerevan is like a dead city 
he said activists told him 60000 soldiers were patrolling the 
city 
mass demonstrations staged in yerevan in late february triggered 
rioting in the azerbaijani city of sumgait where at least 32 were 
killed 197 injured and 400 arrested for murder rape robbery and 
other crimes 
authorities had threatened criminal action against those taking 
part in any future illegal protests to press for annexation of 
nagornokarabakh a predominantly armenian region that has been 
part of azerbaijan since 1923 armenians are predominantly 
christian while most azeris are moslem 
those arrested friday in the southern republic were identified 
as paruyr arikyan mofses gorgisyan georg mirzoyan and mekhak 
gabrielyan said ogorodnikov and bavitsky all four arrested had 
been pressing the annexation cause and providing information to 
foreign journalists 
soviet authorities have forbidden foreign correspondents to 
travel to the region telephone contact has also been disrupted 
numerous attempts to telephone yerevan today were unsuccessful 
even calls to police stations and news offices went unanswered 
ogorodnikov said he was arrested and sent back to moscow after 
arriving in yerevan friday night on an aeroflot flight and 
bavitsky said glasnost magazines office was broken into overnight 
and ransacked in what might have been an official effort to 
discourage continued involvement in the dispute 
glasnost editor sergei grigoryants is armenian and has been 
serving as an information liaison with western news organizations 
meanwhile a national newspaper today accused the communist 
party leadership of trying to suppress the sensitive ethnic dispute 
komsomolskaya pravda said the organs of power should instead 
have openly discussed the proposal with armenians 
the critical commentary in the party youth newspaper contrasted 
sharply with articles friday in two official newspapers pravda and 
izvestia that accused annexation activists of resorting to 
pressure tactics 
trud the labor newspaper criticized the staterun press today 
for failing to accurately report the nagornokarabakh issue out of 
fear that it would stir up passions among the more than 100 soviet 
nationalities 
the armenian government on friday ordered the disbanding of an 
organizing committee spearheading the annexation drive and radio 
moscow reported that selfappointed groups of activists 
intellectuals and republic political leaders were disbanding 
themselves 
morning broadcasts of radio moscow carried no news from armenia 
or nagornokarabakh 
another round of strikes and demonstrations had been called in 
armenia today when the unofficial organizing committee was to 
meet but activists called off the protests to avoid confrontation 
with security forces 
the communist leadership has taken a hard line against the 
annexation campaign and public activism though at the same time 
attempting to appease armenians who fear nagornokarabakh is losing 
its traditional ethnic character 
the politburo has ordered a major improvement in living 
conditions in the region including steady reception of 
armenianlanguage television programming and more armenian 
literature

testimony in the lyndon larouche trial will be 
halted so a judge can investigate whether prosecutors should be 
sanctioned for withholding evidence from the defense 
us district judge robert e keeton made the announcement 
friday after assistant us attorney john markham conceded 
materials he recently surrendered to defense lawyers should have 
been turned over before the trial began in december 
the material concerns a former larouche consultant the defense 
contends was used by the fbi to entrap the political extremist six 
aides and five larouche groups they are charged with plotting to 
obstruct a grand jury investigation of alleged credit card and loan 
fraud during larouches 1984 presidential campaign 
keeton said he also would hold hearings next week to determine 
whether other documents given to the defense lawyers this month 
should have been surrendered earlier those documents discuss 
alleged fbi and cia infiltration of larouche groups and include a 
memo between two pivotal figures in the irancontra scandal 
keeton said the jury would be called into court briefly monday 
so markham could finish questioning a former larouche aide about 
the organizations hierarchy and fund raising 
then keeton will hold a hearing focusing on ryan quade emerson 
a longtime fbi informant who also worked as a consultant to 
larouche 
emerson was listed as a prosecution witness until earlier this 
month about the same time the defense received copies of fbi 
documents indicating a virginia agent sought emersons help with 
the larouche investigation larouches headquarters is in leesburg 
va 
markham has said emerson played a minimal role in the 
investigation but the defense claims the fbi had him make 
erroneous statements to larouche aides about the case 
included in the hundreds of notebooks seized by investigators 
are several passages quoting emerson including one in which he 
said larouche had been successful in blocking the grand jury 
investigation 
markham said the comment was evidence of a conspiracy to 
obstruct the investigation the prosecutor and the fbi agent who 
sought emersons help deny that emerson was told to make the 
statement emerson in an affidavit said he had lied to the 
larouche groups throughout his association with them 
larouche lawyers also learned this week that emerson recorded an 
interview he had with a private investigator hired by a defense 
lawyer and that he played the tape for markham and another 
prosecutor during the interview conducted prior to the trial the 
investigator discussed defense strategy 
at mondays hearing emerson and several fbi agents are 
scheduled to testify about his dealings with the agency 
possible sanctions keeton can impose range from a continuance to 
allow further defense preparation to dismissal of the case 
then provided the case is not dismissed keeton is to hold 
hearings to determine whether markham should have surrendered to 
the defense prior to trial memos discussing possible fbi and cia 
infiltration of larouche groups 
among those is a memo in which retired air force maj gen 
richard secord told thenwhite house aide oliver north that an 
associate had collected info against larouche

today for smuggling cocaine and a us narcotics agent testified 
that a drug ring tricked the photographer into transporting their 
cocaine 
conan owen a 23yearold freelance photographer from annandale 
va is charged with smuggling more than four pounds of cocaine 
into spain in a falsebottomed suitcase on march 13 1987 
the prosecution is asking for 10 years in prison on charges of 
contraband and violating public health laws that prohibit the 
transport or sale of dangerous drugs 
the defense contends that owen didnt know the cocaine was in 
the suitcase 
owen has spent the past year in pretrial detention in 
barcelonas 85yearold model prison without possibility of bail 
he told the court he had carried a suitcase to barcelona from 
santiago chile while on assignment to take travel brochure 
photographs for george barahona an ecuadorborn naturalized 
american living near washington dc 
barahona on feb 5 pleaded guilty to a onecount charge of 
conspiracy to smuggle drugs in us district court in alexandria 
va 
he received a twoyear suspended sentence after he provided 
information that led to the indictment of three spaniards and three 
bolivians in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal drugs they remain at 
large 
barahona told an american court he had shared a hotel room with 
owen in santiago and planted the cocainelined suitcase on owen 
owen said he thought the suitcase contained only travel 
brochures and film and said barahona had represented himself as one 
of the owners of the sorosa travel agency in suburban washington 
special agent james kibble of the drug enforcement 
administration testified for the defense that he became interested 
in the owen case while assigned to the us embassy in madrid 
because owen was from the washington dc area and the dea was 
investigating a cocainesmuggling ring the agency believed operated 
out of northern virginia 
i have found that there is a group of people involved in 
sending drugs from south america to spain using unsuspecting people 
as carriers kibble testified 
kibble also testified he came to the conclusion owen was 
innocent or stupid but innocent 
assistant us district attorney justin williams testified for 
the defense that testimony obtained from barahona following a 
pleabargain arrangement with his attorney indicated owen had 
unwittingly taken the cocaineladen suitcase to spain 
he barahona specifically told us that conan owen had no 
knowledge that there was cocaine in the suitcase he carried into 
barcelona airport march 13 williams said 
there are no jury trials in spain and judge jose presencia 
rubio said at the close of the 2hour trial he would deliver his 
verdict later 
owen wore a grey suit and stood with his hands clasped behind 
his back when addressing the court 
he spoke in spanish with occasional assistance from a 
courtappointed interpreter 
his parents ernest and raquel owen of annandale va sat 
directly behind him his 25yearold brother evan also was 
present 
prosecutor teresa calvo called only two witnesses the 
paramilitary civil guard on duty at el prat airport who discovered 
the cocaine and the chemist who analysed the drug as being 
84percent pure cocaine 
defense attorney ana campa said the prosecution had not proven 
owen knew there was cocaine in the suitcase and said the defendant 
had never denied taking the luggage from santiago to barcelona 
owen told the court he had always obeyed the laws of the country 
in which he was and said he could have been stupid but that is 
not a crime 
owen is a graduate of syracuse university

the political invectives exchanged between 
china and taiwan for decades can barely be heard over a new chorus 
lets do business together 
merchants are scrambling to trade across the taiwan straits as 
china presses ahead with its modernization program and taiwan eases 
its nocontact policy with the communist mainland 
the development could profoundly influence future political 
relations between the countries some political experts say 
how can you help but find that relations will just keep on 
rolling after this said byron weng a political analyst at 
chinese university of hong kong to be able to do business 
necessarily leads to political cooperation 
taiwanese officials say direct trade will remain outlawed for 
the present but signs of increased business ties made through 
legal and illegal channels are apparent in both countries 
taiwanese markets openly display chinese medicinal herbs 
ginseng dates walnuts and other foodstuffs from the mainland 
mouthwatering mainland specialties dried duck from nanking 
salted fish from canton and whole hams from jinhua in zhejiang 
province also are available in taiwan 
in china factory tours often reveal a taiwanese connection the 
stateoftheart haide polyester plant on hainan island uses 
polyester chips from taiwan shenzhen plastics corp in guangdong 
province boasts that money of an americantaiwanese investor helped 
the firm gain favorable treatment from chinese authorities 
the signs of cooperation arise against a backdrop of years of 
enmity 
after losing a civil war to the communists on the chinese 
mainland and fleeing to taiwan in 1949 the nationalist government 
strictly prohibited taiwanese from doing business with the 
communists anyone caught doing so was considered a traitor 
but the nationalists while continuing to reject official 
contact with the mainland recently eased restrictions on 
peopletopeople ties they also gave a boost last year to now 
flourishing indirect trade by allowing imports of several mainland 
food items through third countries 
much of the business comes through the british colony of hong 
kong on the southeastern china coast where last year indirect 
trade between taiwan and china totaled 15 billion up 58 percent 
from 1986 
taiwans exports accounted for 12 billion of the trade and 
consisted primarily of textiles machinery and electrical 
appliances according to hong kong government trade statistics 
a group of hong kong chinese merchants with ties to the 
nationalist government recently opened the taiwan trade center in 
hong kong to facilitate trade with china about 150 taiwanese 
companies display exhibits there to entice mainland chinese 
companies to buy everything from machine tools to cosmetics 
in the future we will open the market in china said center 
representative tina lee n hwai so i think this is the bridge 
the masscirculation united daily news of taiwan recently 
reported an increasing number of companies have invested or plan to 
invest in china in textiles footwear fertilizers chemicals and 
food processing such activity would have to be carried out through 
third countries 
a chinese official this month disclosed plans to set up in 
southern guangdong province a productprocessing zone for taiwanese 
companies that would receive preferential treatment 
weng the political analyst said china might use such contacts 
with taiwanese businesses as a way to reach people who are not in 
the political field 
political leaders have been deadlocked for 40 years with each 
group claiming to be legitimate rulers over the mainland each 
country says it is committed to reunification but under its own 
terms 
despite the increasing trade taiwanese officials are still 
balking at too much contact too soon with the mainland 
too much direct trade will have a negative impact on our 
efforts to restructure our industries said taiwanese premier yu 
kuokwa recently we want our companies to produce more 
sophisticated products but the mainland market is only a market 
for lowend consumer goods 
some taiwan merchants however argue that profits from selling 
lowend goods to china can be used to acquire advanced technology 
and equipment from the west

a judge has lifted a freeze on the 
citys bank accounts that had threatened to cast the community into 
bankruptcy it was reported saturday 
the st louis postdispatch said a compromise has been reached 
between the city and the lawyer for a family seeking payment of 4 
million jury award permitting the lifting of the freeze 
the lawyer clyde l kuehn and city spokesman james ingram 
would not comment on the report 
however a spokesman for the union bank of east st louis said 
the bank received a copy of the judges order releasing the 
accounts according to the newspaper it did not identify the 
spokesman 
st clair county circuit judge roger m scrivner imposed the 
freeze wednesday in response to a motion filed by kuehn who 
represents walter debow of granite city 
debow suffered permanent brain damage in 1984 after being beaten 
by a cellmate at the east st louis jail he was awarded 4 
million and the illinois supreme court ordered the city of 55000 
residents to pay the settlement 
kuehn successfully petitioned scrivner to freeze the bank 
accounts to force the city to comply with the order 
the latest action will allow at least 85000 in outstanding 
checks to be cashed and probably came in time to enable the city to 
meet next weeks payroll for its 300 employees treasurer charlotte 
r moore said 
the postdispatch reported that the agreement calls for payments 
to debow of 25000 tuesday and a further 54000 by may 17 to 
bring interest on the settlement current 
the newspaper said the agreement also calls for monthly payments 
of 20000 to meet interest of 6 percent while setting up a payment 
plan and a restructuring of the citys utility tax bonds to pay 
off the award

rewriting his own rules for superpower 
summitry president reagan is preparing to go to moscow for talks 
with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev that appear unlikely to 
produce a new arms treaty or resolve major disputes 
with the end of his presidency fast approaching reagan has 
decided to ignore his requirement that a summit must hold the 
promise of success and must lead to the signing of a substantial 
agreement 
the man is 77 years old and i think he wants to come out in 
the history books as somebody who has done tremendous things in 
superpower relations for the longterm benefit of us national 
security said william j taylor vice president for 
politicalmilitary affairs at the center for strategic and 
international studies 
i subscribe to the theory that ronald reagan wants to make a 
strategic arms agreement a centerpiece of what he will have 
accomplished over eight years taylor said i think its 
possible he can do it before next january but i certainly dont 
think its going to happen at the mayjune summit 
reagan will visit moscow from may 29 to june 2 the first 
american president to go to the soviet capital in 14 years 
the president had cited his insistence on guaranteed success in 
refusing to meet with soviet leaders leonid brezhnev konstantin 
chernenko and yuri andropov he bent the rule to hold an 
introductory meeting with gorbachev in 1985 
however the rule was back in force in 1986 when reagan met with 
gorbachev in reykjavik iceland with no advance prospects of 
agreement reagan doggedly refused to call it a summit 
for their third meeting the washington summit last december 
an agreement was ready for signing to abolish intermediaterange 
nuclear missiles 
gorbachev had refused to come to washington until that treaty 
was completed but in inviting reagan to moscow the soviet leader 
made no demand for the completion of an even more ambitious arms 
agreement the strategic arms accord that would cut deeply into 
longrange nuclear weapons 
reagan and gorbachev both appear content to meet merely for the 
sake of meeting 
even with no agreements there are sure to be political rewards 
for both leaders 
reagan and gorbachev both will get credit for continuing the 
superpower dialogue at the highest level and for struggling with 
the difficult problems of arms control analysts say 
for gorbachev the summit will showcase his foreign policy 
achievements before a communist party conference later in june 
for reagan it will highlight efforts toward peacemaking as the 
presidential campaign moves toward the democratic and republican 
nominating conventions 
it will give the perception of progress in dealing with the 
soviet union which certainly will help george bush the expected 
gop nominee said william schneider an analyst at the american 
enterprise institute 
both sides reagan and gorbachev get political benefit in 
showing progress is being made its hard to have a summit and not 
come up with something schneider said 
taylor said reagan also will score points in europe where polls 
show gorbachev is perceived more of a peacemaker than reagan 
yet it appears unlikely they will be able to sign a new arms 
accord i wouldnt want to lay you odds secretary of state 
george p shultz said when asked if a treaty would be ready 
similarly the superpowers have deep differences about 
afghanistan central america and the middle east that were not 
resolved by three days of talks between shultz and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze last week 
putting a positive spin on the summit white house spokesman 
marlin fitzwater said it will be well prepared there will be 
substance to discuss there will be good prospects for success 
there will be a number of important and substantive and meaningful 
issues to be resolved and all of those will occur at the moscow 
summit 
asked how that would meet the old criteria of having a major 
agreement ready for signing fitzwater said it meets all the 
criteria that needs to be met

pakistans chief negotiator at the afghanistan 
peace talks said saturday that an agreement could be clinched if 
the soviets would agree with the united states to suspend all aid 
to the warring parties 
acting foreign minister zain noorani said that since another 
outstanding issue that of a transitional government appears to 
have been resolved in principle we feel that as soon as the two 
guarantors resolve the issue of symmetry the instruments can be 
signed 
by symmetry he was referring to washingtons position that 
it would be a guarantor of a settlement only if the soviet union 
stops military aid to the kabul government at the same time the 
united states ceases military aid to the moslem guerrillas fighting 
the government 
the soviets have rejected that demand as amounting to 
interference with relations between two sovereign states bound by 
international treaties 
the washington post reported saturday that the reagan 
administration is cutting off its supply of stinger antiaircraft 
missiles to the afghan resistance but is rushing at least 300 
million in other weapons to them before an agreement is reached 
the post cited diplomatic and other us sources who were not 
identified it said the decision to stop supplying stingers 
apparently was reached late last month in anticipation of a peace 
settlement in afghanistan 
among the uspurchased military equipment being rushed to the 
resistance are 120mm spanish heavy mortars and modern mineclearing 
weapons the post said 
noorani briefing reporters said the soviet union is not 
prepared to stop or suspend aid to kabul it seeks the unilateral 
right to continue to supply arms to the peoples democratic party of 
afghanistan 
he said a soviet willingness to assume equal and reciprocal 
obligations as a guarantor can clinch the geneva agreements and a 
political settlement of the afghan problem 
noorani said pakistan has told un mediator diego cordovez 
that the texts of the four instruments of an agreement are now 
complete and that pakistan does not seek any amendments or changes 
or modifications in the drafts 
he noted that the issue of a transitional government appeared to 
have been resolved following last weeks meeting between secretary 
of state george p shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze 
pakistan has insisted during the talks that a broadbased 
transitional government would be needed in afghanistan to ensure 
peace in the country following the withdrawal of the estimated 
115000 red army troops moscow had balked saying this was outside 
the scope of the peace talks 
but a us official said in washington on thursday that moscow 
had indicated support for having cordovez act in a personal 
capacity to promote an intraafghan dialogue 
in a related development diplomatic sources said that nicolay 
kozyrev the special soviet envoy who has followed the talks from 
the wings since the latest round began march 2 met noorani 
saturday to brief him on the shultzshevardnadze talks 
the unsponsored talks are due to resume monday following a 
weekend recess

the state department was close to proposing a 
halt in covert us military aid to the afghan resistance in 
exchange for an agreement by the soviets to withdraw from 
afghanistan but president reagan rejected the idea say current 
and former administration officials 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said after talks 
last week in washington that reagans tougher line was the final 
obstacle to kremlin acceptance of a unbrokered deal to get the 
red army out of afghanistan but he said the soviets might pull out 
even without a un agreement 
last december reagan said publicly that military assistance to 
the afghan mujahedeen would continue until the soviets were 
completely out of afghanistan but the washington post reported 
saturday that the administration already is ending the supply of 
stinger antiaircraft missiles to the resistance in anticipation of 
a peace settlement 
at the same time the post reported the administration is 
rushing at least 300 million worth of other uspurchased 
military supplies including 120mm spanish heavy mortars to 
afghanistan in an effort to get the weaponry there before any pact 
barring future aid takes effect 
the newspaper quoting unidentified diplomatic sources said the 
stinger cutoff reflects a general nervousness by the administration 
about leaving a large number of the missiles in the hands of afghan 
factions that cannot be controlled after us ties are cut iran 
already has obtained some of the missiles perhaps through force 
from one guerrilla commander 
the apparent confusion over us policy results from what former 
and current white house pentagon state department and 
congressional officials say has been a poorly coordinated end 
game strategy for afghanistan 
my phone rang one day and it was someone asking what our 
policy was on cutting off aid to the mujahedeen said a former 
white house official speaking on condition of anonymity i said 
that our policy was to continue the aid until the soviets were 
completely out then i called over to the state department and 
found out they had other ideas 
later that same day dec 3 reagan forced the state department 
to scramble when a reporter asked if aid to the guerrillas would 
cease when the soviets began to withdraw reagan said 
i dont think we could do anything of the kind because the 
puppet government that has been left there has a military you 
cant suddenly disarm them and leave them prey to the other 
government 
the state department then formulated a new policy still not as 
hard as the presidents telling congress that us aid would end 
once the soviet withdrawal began but would be resumed if moscow 
continued to supply its client regime in afghanistan with wepons 
we will continue our assistance to the afghan resistance until 
it is no longer needed deputy assistant secretary of state 
robert peck told the house foreign affairs subcommittee on asian 
and pacific affairs on feb 25 
and peck denied assertions by two congressional backers of the 
afghan resistance sen gordon humphrey rnh and rep charles 
wilson dtex that the department cut a secret deal with the 
kremlin to stop aid to the guerrillas 
there have been no secret deals no deals at all said peck 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva still found the 
state department position too soft and pushed through congress a 
resolution calling for aid to continue until the last soviet 
soldier leaves afghanistan 
still unhappy with the state department position byrd warned 
reagan in a letter last tuesday that ending us and soviet aid at 
the same time would have a shocking result and telegraph the 
end of our commitment to the mujahedeen while the soviets maintain 
the major portion of leverage in afghanistan 
he urged reagan to make a thorough review of any commitments 
which may have been made without your full support or knowledge 
talk of a secret deal apparently stemmed from a letter from 
deputy secretary of state john c whitehead to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cueller in december 1985 
describing us willingness to play an appropriate guarantors 
role in the context of a comprehensive and balanced settlement 
whiteheads letter was little noticed at the time although 
he discussed it in a speech on dec 13 1985 
one of the provisions of the stillsecret un plan would 
require pakistan to cease permitting the use of its territory as 
a conduit for military assistance to the mujahedeen within 60 
days after the pact was signed according to a senate foreign 
relations committee report issued last week 
the whitehead letter and the demand that pakistan shut down the 
supply pipeline apparently led the kremlin to believe that reagan 
was ready to end aid to the guerrillas when the red army began to 
pull out 
back in 1985 no one really believed that the soviets would 
pull out so i guess no one really thought the policy through 
said a state department source speaking on condition of anonymity 
when we got closer to an agreement to the end game we began to 
rethink the position

in their tenth month of crisis many 
panamanians are adopting the american view that officials in 
washington cant see beyond the potomac river 
as panamas problems have grown from bad to desperate the word 
out of washington has been that the days even hours of gen 
manuel antonio noriega are numbered 
panamanians arent convinced 
jose mulino a leader in the opposition national civic crusade 
says panamas military strongman shows no signs of throwing in the 
towel soon 
as an antinoriega strike ended its first week friday mulino 
rolled his eyes when asked by a reporter if the defense chiefs 
ouster appeared close 
i dont think so he replied i dont know what it is 
going to take to get him out but the strike will continue 
the very different view of washington was illustrated late last 
week by a visiting us congressman 
when we were stateside we were given a picture of a very 
short frame of reference said rep gary ackerman dny we 
were told we were looking at a time frame of a very few days in 
which noriega might be expected to depart cave in what have you 
that assessment came from state department officials who briefed 
ackerman and rep peter h kostmayer dpa before they left 
thursday on their two day factfinding trip for the house foreign 
affairs committee 
less than 24 hours later in panama ackerman and kostmayer had a 
new frame of reference 
the view were getting here is quite different from the us 
embassy from the american military and from panamanians weve 
talked with ackerman said nobodys talking about hours 
nobodys talking about days and thats for sure 
a few days earlier a panamanian woman pleaded for us help as 
she ran past an american reporter watching soldiers clear a street 
of demonstrators with tear gas and shotgun pellets 
whats the united states waiting for she yelled cant 
you see whats happening there are our soldiers where are yours 
many panamanians want the united states to do more in a bid to 
force noriegas exit some speak openly of military intervention 
something president reagan has ruled out unless the panama canal is 
clearly threatened 
even the wife of eric arturo delvalle the president in hiding 
whose ouster by noriega last month fueled panamas current crisis 
has suggested publicly that the united states may have to send in 
troops as a last resort 
but the canal appears safe for the moment and american military 
intervention seems unlikely 
i dont think anybody even if their elevator doesnt go all 
the way to the top floor would consider jeopardizing the canal 
ackerman said 
while washington has been counting hours until noriegas 
anticipated departure panamanians have heard their clocks tick 
through an escalating series of constitutional and financial crises 
that have left their once prosperous country destitute their banks 
and businesses closed and many people without cash or food 
washington has been partly responsible for the fiscal crisis 
through its economic sanctions but most of the crunch stems from 
years of unbridled spending by militarydominated governments that 
have held sway in panama since 1968 they have given the country a 
48 billion foreign debt one of the highest per capita in the 
world 
the country is in such bad shape that washington is worried 
further economic sanctions could leave it a dead prospect for any 
future democratic government thats one reason reagan hasnt 
imposed a total trade embargo against panama limiting american

six moslem fishermen were shot and 
killed off the eastern coast of sri lanka and nine of their 
companions were missing and feared dead a sri lankan military 
official said saturday 
the official said six bulletriddled bodies washed ashore 
saturday near the eastern port of trincomalee the men and nine 
others had set out a day earlier from the village of nilaweli 
north of trincomalee harbor he said 
trincomalee is 150 miles northeast of colombo 
the official said he had no information on who might have killed 
the fishermen he briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
a sri lankan news agency blamed the attack on the liberation 
tigers of tamil eelam the largest of the rebel groups that has 
been waging a nearly fiveyear war for an independent tamil 
homeland in the north and east of the island 
the united news of india quoted residents of the area as saying 
they heard the sounds of motor boats and gun shots off the coast 
friday night 
uni said several hundred angry fishermen surrounded the police 
station at the village of muttur just south of trincomalee to 
protest the slayings 
tamils most of whom are hindus make up 18 percent of the 
nations 16 million population they claim they are discriminated 
against by the majority sinhalese buddhists 
the sinhalese who comprise about 75 percent of the population 
control the central government and the military the rest of sri 
lankans are moslem descendants of early arab traders or christian 
descendants of western colonial settlers 
tamil militants have in the past attacked moslems in the east 
to underscore their claim to the region 
india signed a peace accord with sri lanka last july aimed at 
ending the tamils insurgency but the tigers have rejected the 
accord and have continued their guerrilla war 
india which has a large tamil population in its south has more 
than 50000 troops on the island to try to enforce the peace pact 
on saturday the daily news a progovernment newspaper said 
the government has taken at least 300 sinhalese into custody on 
suspicion they are members of the outlawed peoples liberation front 
the front has pledged to kill anyone who supports the 
indianbrokered peace accord contending that it makes too many 
concessions to tamils 
the front has been blamed for killing at least 220 people and 
injuring 170 in the past five months 
another paper the independent sun put the arrest total at 
around 650 in the past six months both quoted unnamed police 
sources

the ceasefire agreement signed this past week 
between nicaraguas leftist government and the contra rebels 
represents the most significant turning point for that country 
since the united states first began backing the insurgents in 1981 
barring unexpected developments the agreement will probably 
bring the war to an end and leave the ruling sandinistas with a 
firm grip on power the sandinistas have ruled nicaragua since 
their 1979 revolution 
president reagan expended considerable political capital over 
the years attempting to convince his countrymen that sandinista 
power left unchecked would mean a soviet beachhead in central 
america and grave national security risks for the united states 
but reagan was unable to muster consistent majority support for 
his policy there were too many in congress who felt that the human 
costs of sustaining the war were too high when compared with the 
benefits reagan saw in trying to overthrow the sandinistas 
the price paid by nicaraguans over the past seven years has been 
obvious the war has claimed more than 40000 lives and left the 
economy in a shambles 
the policy never had much enthusiastic support beyond the 
conservative wing of the republican party in latin america it was 
difficult to find any president willing to express support for 
contra aid even in those central american countries which reagan 
said would be most affected by the collapse of the rebels 
for all the energy reagan spent in support of the contras 
congress approved only about 209 million for them over seven years 
equivalent to what the administration says the soviet union 
provides to the sandinistas every few months during the height of 
the vietnam war the united states committed thousands of troops 
and spent that much every few days 
now it appears there is little the united states can do to 
influence events in nicaragua the administration has used 
extensive diplomatic and economic pressures to force the 
sandinistas hand with minimal results and now it has been deprived 
of what reagan and the contras believe is their most effective 
lever military pressure the best the contras can hope for now is 
a humanitarian aid package the congress will take up next week 
given its past statements the administration may try to take 
advantage of the new mood of reconciliation in nicaragua and 
explore ways to achieve a more normal relationship with the 
sandinistas there have been no serious talks between the two 
governments in more than three years 
there are several theoretical scenarios under which what was 
done last week could be undone and the war resumed under 
administration prodding the congress could decide to commit itself 
next week to an early vote on additional contra military aid if the 
peace process breaks down and reagan makes an aid request 
but it appears a majority in congress worn down by the contra 
aid issue does not want to give the president that authority 
the most likely outcome is a contra surrender to terms set forth 
by the sandinistas during talks due to start on april 6 on a 
permanent truce 
under the agreement the contras will be allowed to take their 
arms with them to mutually agreed ceasefire zones but their 
supplies are running low there is little prospect for 
replenishment and nothing prevents the sandinista army from 
surrounding these zones while talks on a permanent settlement are 
carried out the contras will be at a severe disadvantage 
after a year in which the contras had emerged as an effective 
fighting force dispatching thousands of troops into nicaragua from 
sanctuaries in honduras 1988 has marked a steady downward spiral 
the house defeated a key contra aid vote on feb 3 and the 
congress decreed an end to all aid shipments on feb 29 the 
contras agreed less than a month later to a ceasefire proposal 
that fell far short of their demands even though they won some 
concessions from the sandinistas including the promise of free 
speech and contra participation in a national dialogue 
the administration has praised the agreement but this is one 
instance in which there is a wide gap between the publicly stated 
view and the private assessment 
officials felt it was inappropriate to criticize the contras for 
signing an agreement after a lack of us steadfastness forced 
their hand 
the contras made their own decision and they made it 
courageously and we must not do anything to undo it said white 
house chief of staff howard baker in an interview on cable news 
networks evans amp novak saturday weve got to wish them 
well as indeed we do 
some of the most optimistic statements are being voiced by the 
contra leaders themselves including adolfo calero who is among 
the most conservative of that group 
today we have taken a first but firm step to end this 
fratricidal war calero said wednesday night after the agreement 
was signed 
it is a very serious obligation that we are undertaking the 
government of nicaragua as well as we in the resistance i am 
certain that we will both comply 
if calero is right then reagan may be proved to have been wrong 
all along about the nature of the sandinista government

newspapers and television are coming under 
increasing fire from governments across the world which claim 
their coverage of violence and unrest only creates more of the same 
in some cases coverage has been limited in others it has been 
banned outright 
a graphic television film of recent bloody rampages at two 
northern ireland funerals prompted strong complaints from the 
british government that reaction was mild compared with other 
countries 
in israel the army regularly bars reporters and television 
crews from the occupied west bank and the gaza strip rocked by 
protests since dec 8 in south africa photographing or filming 
unrest and security force actions is prohibited in a state where 
antiapartheid protests are common 
tibet is closed to foreigners whenever an antichinese protest 
occurs and no western reporter has been allowed to the troubled 
soviet republics of armenia or azerbaijan 
there does seem to be a trend to keep the television cameras 
away said philip spender deputy editor of the index of 
censorship a london periodical that monitors media freedom 
worldwide 
a very vivid picture says volumes and its very hard for a 
government to deny its presiding over the mistreatment of 
people spender said in a recent interview 
some observers say in the long run censorship wont work 
if you look at south africa at the moment the people who are 
being fooled by the turning off of the cameras are essentially the 
whites certainly not the blacks said leonard sussman executive 
director of freedom house a private human rights agency in new 
york the blacks know exactly whats happening they either see 
it with their own eyes or they hear rumors and rumors tend to 
exaggerate and that builds new problems 
observers say many governments use the possibility of increased 
violence to mask their real concern their image abroad other 
governments are more forthright 
panama for example has expelled or refused to admit foreign 
reporters and warned others it will not tolerate what it calls 
the continuation of disinformation that damages the image of 
our country abroad 
many israelis are angry because television has documented 
palestinian unrest and israeli attempts to crush it in 
particular recent cbstv shots of soldiers beating two unarmed 
palestinians 
israeli president chaim herzog recently referred to news reports 
as a weapon being used against israel 
i ask myself whether im permitted in a very liberal and 
democratic approach to allow this weapon to be turned against my 
children and my country he said 
former us secretary of state henry kissinger and new york 
mayor ed koch have both suggested israel ban television crews from 
the occupied territories altogether 
before imposing stringent media controls south african 
officials had complained that tv coverage encouraged unrest 
but their main complaint was that the coverage gave a false or 
exaggerated impression of black dissent and encouraged sanctions 
and disinvestment moves 
sussman and others acknowledged that news reports can stir up 
trouble 
but i think you have to weigh the damage thats done by the 
opposite by the clampdown he said 
journalists should police themselves he said 
they have to be wary that theyre not being used or 
exploited by either of the parties whether its the government or 
the objectors he said 
sussman said that censorship is justified when lives are at 
stake because of a really volatile situation 
but usually governments take the easier road of stepping in 
well before that points arrived and thats the damage to 
freedom he said 
the londonbased international press institute said it opposes 
any attempt to curb news gathering 
whether cameras can incite i think theres no doubt that they 
do its spokesman said but the question is which is the 
greater ill you have to inform the public 
in britain few suggest the government should limit media 
coverage in northern ireland where nearly 2700 people have died 
in almost 20 years of sectarian fighting 
indeed public debate over the television footage of the bloody 
funeral has focused primarily on british police efforts to obtain 
untransmitted videotape to identify suspects 
on thursday after threats of prosecution under antiterrorist 
laws british and irish tv networks gave police untransmitted 
videotape of an irish republican army funeral procession that ended 
with the slayings of two british soldiers 
the networks had initially refused to hand over the tape on 
grounds it would endanger the lives of their crews working in the 
british province 
to prime minister margaret thatcher it was a much simpler 
issue as she outlined it to the house of commons 
either one is on the side of justice in this matter or on the 
side of terrorism she said

as george bush amazed the pundits with a 
political resurrection the democrats lost a frontrunner off the 
good ship monkey business staged what looked like candidateaweek 
auditions for a replacement and now worry about a convention 
without a clear winner 
at its midpoint the 1988 presidential campaign can claim more 
than its share of unexpected twists and turns 
without a frontrunner the lesser known democrats found it hard 
to get attention and gain stature 
the race became a series of isolated judgments said bill 
carrick campaign manager for rep richard gephardt carrick 
referred to the phenomenon of no democratic being able to put 
together a series of victories 
and as both parties looked ahead to november they expressed 
pessimism 
this looks to me like 1960 all over again said donald 
devine a conservative republican and adviser to kansas sen bob 
doles presidential campaign that was a year the democrats 
recaptured the white house at the close of republican dwight 
eisenhowers second term 
once again said devine you have an aging president whos 
kind of loved and recognized as doing a decent job 
this is the democrats year he lamented the republicans 
are going to have to work real hard to change that and the 
democrats are going to have to help them a little in this 
nomination process which i think theyre going to do 
some democrats agree that they could easily give the republican 
the help they need 
gov mario cuomo of new york predicted therell be some 
brokering before the partys nominee can be selected and he warned 
that if it takes place at the democratic national convention next 
summer in atlanta the whole united states will see you in the 
grubby business of cutting deals 
two democrats gary hart and joseph biden were knocked out of 
contention long before any votes were cast television evangelist 
pat robertson startled republicans with his organizational skill 
and even more with his accounts of conversations with god 
southern democrats tried to give their nominating process a 
conservative cast and created super tuesday which gave the biggest 
boost to a pair of liberals jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
iowas reputation took a beating and so did momentum 
voters demonstrated repeatedly they dont always do what the 
pollsters predict they will 
and once again money proved the indispensable element of 
campaigns for everybody but jackson 
after ronald reagan who 
among republicans the debate centered on who could legitimately 
claim his conservative legacy and retain some of his electoral 
magic for the most conservative element in the party it also was 
the year to determine whether they or gop moderates represented by 
bush would control the party in the postreagan era 
the democrats looked forward to a presidential campaign without 
reagan on the ballot but also were aware they had lost four of the 
last five national elections being virtually shut out in the south 
and west 
they too talked of a fight for control of the partys future 
both parties started out with bumper crops of candidates and 
near candidates 
remember donald rumsfeld a former illinois congressman white 
house chief of staff and defense secretary he had a resume that 
rivaled bushs and a speaking style that was a sure cure for 
insomnia he appeared at republican events around the country 
trying to drum up support for a presidential bid before finally 
giving up on april 2 1987 
former sen paul laxalt of nevada best known as reagans close 
friend also dipped a toe into the presidential waters but pulled 
it out when he discovered how tough it could be to raise millions 
of dollars 
conseratives were titillated by the prospect that pat buchanan 
the former white house communications director or jeane 
kirkpatrick the former united nations ambassador would run both 
eventually said no 
the democrats had their share of reluctant dragons 
sen sam nunn of georgia considered running and then didnt 
sen bill bradley of new jersey said no no a thousand times no 
sen dale bumpers of arkansas and his governor bill clinton 
decided against running rep pat schroeder of colorado wanted to 
run but found raising enough money too great a hurdle 
and then of course there was the ubiquitous governor cuomo of 
new york 
i will not be a candidate cuomo declared in 1987 setting 
off still more speculation on whether or not he was running 
why dont you want to be president he was asked a year 
later 
who said i dont want to be president he retorted 
do you want to be president pressed the questioner 
no he replied 
but there plenty of real candidates 
bush dole robertson rep jack kemp of new york former gov 
pete du pont of delaware and former secretary of state alexander m 
haig jr on the republican side 
hart biden dukakis jackson rep richard gephardt of 
missouri sen paul simon of illinois former gov bruce babbitt of 
arizona and sen albert gore jr of tennessee for the democrats 
the race began early with democrats gephardt biden and babbitt 
taking the traditional route throught the small towns of iowa 
campaigning for legislative candidates in the 1986 elections dole 
kemp and du pont did much the same thing on the republican side 
meanwhile michigan republicans tried to grab some of the 
presidential campaign spotlight in the summer of 1986 they 
elected thousands of precinct level party officials who eventually 
would decide the allocation of the states 77member delegation to 
the gop convention in new orleans in august 1988 
the bush campaign liked the idea the vice president beat reagan 
in michigans 1980 primary 
but robertson was already at work and his forces matched the 
vice presidents at the crucial task of recruiting candidates for 
the michigan election that was the first indication of robertsons 
potential 
it was bad news for bush and even worse for kemp 
then came irancontra and the disclosures that the 
administration had been involved in covert arms sales to the 
ayatollah 
it was a bleak moment for the administration and it looked like 
bush would be the principal political victim 
doles advisers were split on the likely impact but the senator 
was among those who thought it would severely wound bush 
i thought it was serious said lee atwater bush campaign 
manager but i never thought it would deprive the vice president 
of the nomination 
iowas economy would prove an even greater hurdle for bush 
throughout the reagan presidency things had gone from bad to 
worse in the state and it was one of the few soft spots in reagans 
generally strong approval from americans 
dole campaigned there as a fellow midwesterner with a rural 
background and an understanding of the problems of farmers 
im from russell kansas and proud of it he told countless 
audiences 
the campaign began to get nasty 
hes sort of had a charmed life in politics hes gotten quite 
a ways without ever doing much dole said of the vice president 
as dole continued to portray bush as a vice president who had no 
more than a passive role in administration affairs the bush 
campaign accused the senator of being meanspirited and 
practicing cronyism 
dole later accused the bush campaign of deliberately trying to 
provoke him 
i think that was the effort he said i was a bit testy a 
time or two i was getting angry

robert chambers jr surrendered today after 
pleading guilty to strangling a young woman during a central park 
tryst his plea ended the 10weeklong preppie murder trial 
that focused attention on the lifestyles of the young rich 
chambers 21 admitted guilt friday to a lesser charge of 
firstdegree manslaughter halting jury deliberations that lasted 
nine days and raised fears of a possible mistrial 
chambers plea calls for a sentence of five to 15 years in 
prison and he surrendered about 1030 am today at criminal court 
in manhattan where he began processing before being sent to the 
city jail at rikers island formal sentencing is scheduled april 15 
chambers admitted that he intended to seriously hurt jennifer 
dawn levin 18 the night of her death her battered partly nude 
body was found under a tree behind the metropolitan museum of art 
on aug 26 1986 
the agreement under which he made his plea was approved by miss 
levins family chambers must serve five years before being 
eligible for parole 
ill feel better when hes in jail where he should be 
said ellen levin the victims mother he wasnt the lilywhite 
altar boy he appeared to be 
during the trial chambers defense had been that he had lashed 
out at jennifer levin when she hurt him during rough sex and that 
he had not meant to kill her 
chambers parents robert and phyllis chambers stared silently 
and showed no emotion as their only child reluctantly entered his 
plea 
he seemed both angry and sad as he stood before state supreme 
court justice howard bell who asked chambers whether he had 
intended to cause serious physical injury to miss levin the 
key element for the manslaughter charge 
looking back on everthing id have to say yes chambers 
replied in a lowered voice as he appeared to choke back sobs in 
my heart that is not what i intended 
the jury could have convicted chambers of seconddegree murder 
a more serious charge but manhattan district attorney robert 
morgenthau said the prospect of a possible mistrial the strain on 
the levin family and the circumstantial evidence in a murder trial 
prompted the plea bargain 
a prosecution source told the associated press that among their 
considerations were notes from three jurors who wanted to leave 
leading to the concern over a mistrial the source spoke only on 
condition of anonymity 
the slaying was dubbed the preppie murder because the victim 
and the prime suspect were products of new yorks monied elite who 
went to private schools and came from wealthy families 
chambers a former altar boy flunked out of the exclusive 
choate school before entering and graduating from york prep in 
manhattan 
he dropped out of boston university in his first year and 
developed a cocaine habit for which he was institutionalized twice 
to help feed the habit he committed burglaries a prosecutor said 
chambers who had been charged with three counts of burglary 
pleaded guilty to one of those counts friday 
miss levin went to the park with chambers after telling friends 
he was the best sex partner she ever had and that she was 
determined to have sex with him that night 
shortly after his arrest chambers told police in a videotaped 
statement that he had never intended to hurt miss levin 
he said she had molested him sexually and hurt his genitals and 
he killed her accidentally he said miss levin had tied his hands 
behind his back with her panties sat on his chest facing his feet 
and grabbed his genitals 
chambers said he freed his hands reached up with his left 
forearm and yanked back against her throat flipping her off him 
assistant district attorney linda fairstein called chambers 
story ludicrous 
she told the jury that he attacked miss levin in a rage punched 
her chased her when she tried to flee caught her and squeezed 
the life out of her 
fairstein holding a photo of miss levin taken in dorrians red 
hand bar hours before her death said one cant help but look at 
that photograph and pray for time to stand still for time to grab 
her and say dont go with robert chambers

liberation organization and the state department announced shultz 
will got to the middle east next week to again push a us peace 
initiative 
professors edward said of columbia university and ibrahim abu 
lughud met for more than an hour with shultz who had invited them 
to the state department 
we conveyed to secretary shultz the urgent need to lift 
israels occupation of the west bank and gaza as a preparatory step 
on the road to achieving peaceful coexistence between palestinian 
arabs and israeli jews said said after the meeting the 
professor earlier said he had been in touch with plo chairman 
yasser arafat about the meeting with shultz 
the state department rejected news organizations requests to 
photograph shultz and the palestinian leaders both us citizens 
at the start of their meeting 
the secretary whose last mideast peaceseeking trip was a month 
ago has been trying to arrange negotiations that would lead to a 
settlement between israel and the palestinians israel rejects plo 
participation in any negotiations 
department spokesman charles redman said shultz made the 
decision to return to the middle east on friday after meeting 
philip habib his chief negotiator on mideast problems he will 
arrive in jerusalem sunday april 3 and visit jordan egypt syria 
and saudi arabia the following week redman said 
state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley called the visitors 
prominent americans with an intimate knowledge of contemporary 
middle eastern politics she also confirmed they are members of 
the palestine national council which is often called the plos 
legislative arm 
under us law administration officials are barred from holding 
meetings with plo officials but mrs oakley stressed that the two 
guests are us citizens and said the meeting did not represent a 
change in us policy

an overall middle east peace agreement the plan designed to 
overcome israeli objections to talking to the plo envisions

in january shultz met here with two palestinian arabs hanna 
siniora a jerusalem editor and fayez abu rahme a gaza lawyer 
during a mideast shuttle trip last month shultz tried to 
arrange a meeting in jerusalem with 15 palestinian arabs but none 
showed up apparently by order of the plo 
the state department meanwhile issued a warning to americans 
not to travel to the israeliheld west bank and gaza where 111 
palestinians and an israeli soldier have been killed in clashes 
since january 9 
there was no explanation for the timing of the advisory but it 
coincided with the approach of easter and passover holidays that 
usually attract us tourists to the holy land including sites on 
the west bank 
israel is safe for american travel mrs oakley said 
the west bank was held by jordan and gaza by egypt from 1949 
until 1967 when the arabs lost the territories to israel in the 
sixday war about 96 percent of the population is palestinian 
the situation in east jerusalem was described as 
unpredictable and americans were advised to check with us 
diplomats in the city before entering the area 
under all circumstances americans should avoid demonstrations 
and other situations that have the potential to lead to violence 
the advisory said american travelers should carry their us 
passports at all times

president reagans defeat last week on a major 
antidiscrimination bill demonstrates the chasm between his 
administration and the rest of america when it comes to civil 
rights say those who fought for passage of the measure 
some conservatives counter that reagans positions are very much 
in tune with the american mainstream 
the enactment of the civil rights restoration act over reagans 
veto was the latest skirmish in the administrations rocky 
sevenyear attempt to redefine and some say erase the federal 
governments role in ensuring basic rights to all citizens 
reagan and his conservative allies contend they are committed to 
a colorblind society and reject the idea that they are less 
concerned about discrimination than those who support stronger 
remedies 
but their vision has led to years of confrontation with 
democrats and liberals and often with moderates conservatives 
republicans and business people as well 
people simply dont want to go back and undo things that have 
been accomplished over the last 20 years says veteran civil 
rights attorney william taylor who helped draft the restoration 
act 
but some conservatives say the administrations victories have 
not drawn the attention they deserve and do in fact reflect the 
publics feelings 
the picture is more mixed than perhaps some would have people 
think about the reagan administration and its civil rights policy 
and how much its in sync with the public said former associate 
deputy attorney general bruce fein now a fellow at the 
conservative heritage foundation 
fein said the media has not fairly portrayed the 
administrations progress toward its civil rights goals on the 
victories they end up with a little threegraf snippet on page 
25 he complained 
but ralph neas executive director of the 185group leadership 
conference on civil rights said the victories have been small 
andor temporary 
congress and the supreme court have reined in the excesses of 
the reagan administration he said the only time they the 
administration have been able to do anything or change anything is 
when they have acted by executive fiat 
the administration provoked an uproar early in 1982 when it 
tried to reverse a longstanding policy of not giving tax breaks to 
segregated schools and caused more controversy a year later by 
firing three liberal members of the supposedly independent civil 
rights commission 
among other things the administration has also tried and failed 
to 
block strong economic sanctions against the south african 
government for its apartheid policy 
dismantle or weaken ongoing school busing and affirmative 
action plans 
end affirmative action goals and timetables for government 
contractors 
block a tough new extension of the voting rights act in 1982 
and win a different interpretation of it three years later in the 
supreme court 
dissuade congress from enacting a new holiday honoring martin 
luther king 
elevate the architect of its civil rights policies assistant 
attorney general william bradford reynolds to associate attorney 
general 
those are the major defeats where are the comparable victories 
some point to the supreme courts 1984 decision narrowing 
protection under four civil rights laws to specific federally 
assisted programs rather than prohibiting an entire institution 
from discriminating if any part of it receives aid but that ruling 
was reversed last week with the veto override 
there were also two supreme court rulings in which the justices 
found newer minority employees were improperly shielded from 
layoffs while innocent white workers with more seniority were let 
go 
but the justice department later was rebuffed when it asked 51 
local jurisdictions to scrap hiring and promotion plans on the 
basis of the court rulings on seniority and layoffs one republican 
mayor william hudnut of indianapolis said he refused to comply 
with the request because he felt it was wrong constitutionally 
morally and politically 
the high court went on to deal a double blow to the 
administration in 1986 approving the cleveland fire departments 
plan to reserve half of all promotions for minority candidates and 
endorsing a labor unions use of racial quotas to help more 
minorities get jobs 
fein cited several lower court rulings that threw out racial 
quotas in government contracting and said the supreme court would 
review them he also noted a federal appeals court decision this 
month striking down racial quotas used to avert white flight at 
an integrated brooklyn housing development starrett city the 
decision stemmed from a 1984 suit filed by the justice department 
taylor and others in the civil rights community do say that 
reagan has succeeded in dismantling much of the federal civil 
rights law enforcement machinery and has kept advocates busy for 
seven years with rearguard actions 
on the other hand they say in their forced reexamination and 
reevaluation of the nations civil rights policies congress and 
the courts have deemed them essentially sound 
the basic threat the administration posed was turning the 
clock back and turning the country in a different direction 
taylor said they sure tried hard they failed every time to me 
that is a very encouraging development

president reagan said saturday that presummit 
talks have made clear how difficult the issues are between the 
united states and the soviet union and it remains to be seen how 
much good the moscow summit will do 
reagan opened his weekly radio address with a review of his 
meeting wednesday with soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze 
during which he announced that he and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev will meet in moscow may 29 through june 2 
my talks with him were cordial but as you might expect to 
the point he said 
let me also say that while lengthy talks held between 
secretary of state george p shultz and mr shevardnadze at the 
state department were useful they also made clear how difficult 
the issues are between the united states and the soviet union 
the president added 
some progress was made here and there in various areas but 
much more remains to be done given the importance of the topics 
discussed 
touching on arms control human rights and other issues between 
the two countries reagan told his audience that the united 
states will sign only those agreements that are in our best 
interest 
weve come a long way in our attempts to deal with the soviets 
and to further the cause of peace and freedom around the world 
the president said 
the next summit will help he said how much well have to 
see 
reagan also used his speech to urge senate approval of the 
treaty limiting intermediate and shorterrange missiles that he 
and gorbachev signed in washington in december the foreign 
relations committee is scheduled to vote on the treaty during the 
coming week 
reagan also discussed an international trade bill being 
considered by a housesenate conference committee saying some 
administration objections to it have been met but that it still 
contains provisions that would restrict trade deter investment in 
the united states require mandatory retaliation that invites trade 
wars and unnecessarily hamper my prerogatives as president 
for example one proposal still very much alive would create 
an obligation for the government to help each and every company 
that cant keep up with legal totally fair imports in effect an 
entitlement program for businesses that cant compete he said 
he urged congress to stay on course and settle on a bill 
that avoids the great danger of choking off international trade and 
slowing down economic growth 
i will not sign a bill that imperils our economy and threatens 
growth he said

the environmental protection agency says that 
three out of four municipal waste treatment plants it surveyed 
arent able to stop water pollution from industrial toxics 
the epa audit made public at a house hearing last week is 
likely to rekindle a longstanding debate over whether the agency 
has properly enforced the antitoxics provisions of the clean water 
act 
the audit focused on 265 of the 1500 publicly owned sewage 
treatment plants with epaapproved plans which are supposed to 
minimize the amount of toxics reaching the environment 
the audit said that 57 plants have been generally unsuccessful 
in carrying out their plans while another 147 plants have been 
only partially successful in meeting the epaapproved goals 
only 61 plants 23 percent of the total surveyed have 
implemented a generally successful program and are effectively 
carrying out program responsibilities the audit said 
james elder director of epas office of water enforcement and 
permits said the audit indicates that the toxic impacts on 
receiving waters from publicly owned treatment works is more 
significant than previously thought 
the audit focused on the socalled pretreatment aspects of the 
clean water act which is considered one of the nations most 
successful environmental laws because it has halted much direct 
discharging of untreated human waste into waterways 
according to epa between 100000 and 200000 industrial 
concerns of varying size pump their wastes directly into sewers 
along with the wastes of millions of households and other nontoxic 
sources 
the municipal plants are geared principally to treat human and 
other organic matter so it can be pumped into waterways with 
minimal environmental impact 
toxic waste from industry however remains largely untreated in 
the process exiting plants either in the pumpings into waterways 
or trapped in sewage sluge the residue that is disposed of in a 
variety of ways including landfills 
in order to minimize the amount of toxics reaching a treatment 
plant the law requires manufacturers to pretreat waste to remove 
chemicals often an expensive proposition 
under the pretreatment program begun in the mid1970s epa 
generally leaves it up to municipalities to police the toxic 
sources for compliance with epaapproved pretreatment plans 
the audit with findings similar to a smaller survey in in 1985 
showed that 104 of the 267 plants had basically failed to implement 
their pretreatment programs 
the audit also said that municipalities are also hampered in the 
battle against toxic waste in the sewage stream by inadequate legal 
authority ineffective enforcement and too little money committed 
to the job 
the results are shocking frances dubrowski a lawyer 
formerly with the national resources defense council told the 
hearing by two merchant marine and fisheries subcommittees that are 
taking an indepth look at pollution of coastal waters 
extrapolating this data nationwide some 500 to 900 plants 
merited enforcement for failure to implement the pretreatment 
program as congress intended she said yet epa referred only 
10 enforcement cases for failing to implement pretreatment 
the epas elder said that while increased emphasis on the toxics 
problem is making an impact i agree we still have a lot to do 
ms dubrowski said that epa should require treatment plants to 
develop local limits for 126 toxics cited by congress in the 1987 
updating of the clean water act epa has issued requirements for 
only 10 
she also said epa should finally issue standards to regulate the 
toxic content of sewage sludge which can contaminate groundwater 
if deposited in a leaking landfill epa missed sludge standards 
deadlines in 1978 and 1987 but officials say standards are in the 
works 
ms dubrowski and reps gerry studds dmass and william 
hughes dnj said that epa and the states might need to take a 
more active role enforcing pretreatment requirements rather than 
leaving this to municipalities 
for a city to decide to take action against its biggest 
employer takes a big dose of political backbone studds said 
but its very clear a major part of the problem is political will 
at all levels of government 
hughes said that unless enforcement is brought against more 
violators of the clean water act its like the drug traffickers 
they dont feel a risk because the chances of their being targeted 
are very low

shaking down shopkeepers taking protection 
money from criminals dealing drugs collecting kickbacks 
demanding bribes this prosecutors say is how some municipal 
employees spend their days 
the problem is as old as government and the prognosis for a cure 
is as bleak as ever 
theres always going to be people who take advantage of the 
system eight percent of the apostles were corrupt and look at who 
screened them said us attorney andrew maloney 
maloney displayed the latest example of his thesis last week 
announcing charges that 28 current and former city health 
inspectors and supervisors extorted payoffs from restaurateurs by 
threatening sanitary law citations 
the alleged scam may have been repellent and painful as 
health commissioner stephen joseph said but it was not 
particularly new or clever 
its a classic shakedown situation said maloney 
it was just another in a long string of cases alleging municipal 
corruption in the city in recent years ranging from high officials 
taking massive kickbacks to functionaries skimming or extorting 
cash 
its pretty simple human nature and greed said kevin 
frawley the city commissioner of investigation its going after 
something that is tempting to you which is an easy buck 
the local fbi chief james m fox blamed some of the temptation 
on the city government itself 
the vast majority of government workers in new york are honest 
and competent and grossly underpaid fox said if you want to 
maintain integrity in any profession you must pay a living wage to 
the employees government is not doing that today and that is part 
of their problem 
the end result corruption that runs across the range of 
government activities among the most prominent is the case of 
wedtech corp a military contractor accused of paying off state 
and federal politicians for favored treatment another is the 
parking violations bureau case in which some top city political 
leaders were convicted of taking kickbacks for contracts 
but if those lead the list it is the litany of cases that 
indicate the extent of corruption 
in a sting operation revealed in january state prosecutors 
said court representatives stole property from the apartments of 
people they thought had died without family or a will 
in october 35 workers for a company hired by the city to empty 
the cash from parking meters were accused of skimming nearly 1 
million in quarters 
in july authorities charged that guards at a city yard where 
illegally parked cars are towed took bribes to release vehicles to 
their owners 
in may nine current or former maintenance workers and 
supervisors in the city school system were indicted in a nineyear 
kickback scheme 19 people were charged in 1986 
in november 1986 prosecutors charged more than a dozen police 
officers at the 77th precinct in brooklyn with crimes ranging from 
selling cocaine to stealing garbage cans 
in june 1986 us district judge leonard wexler sentenced two 
former housing authority officials to prison for extorting kickback 
money said wexler corruption is turning the city into a 
cesspool 
frawley the citys inhouse corruption investigator has 
another view new york corruption is no greater than in other 
governments or in private business he said but in new york 
grifters get caught 
its a twoedged sword you go after it vigorously you 
announce arrests and the public perception is oh well more 
corruption frawley said if you closed your eyes you wouldnt 
see it this agency and the federal government work very hard to 
expose it 
indeed frawley noted that the fbis local office has beefed up 
its corruption squad and the budget for his own department has 
doubled since 1985 we have a number of active investigations 
he said 
just since the restaurant inspectors arrests the fbis new york 
office has received several calls reporting graft in government 
enough to persuade it to open a 24hour hotline for corruption tips 
this week 
were looking harder than we ever have said fox you say 
theres been a lot of cases there are more coming

the ceasefire pact between the 
sandinistas and contra rebels puts new pressure on the united 
states to hold direct talks with the nicaraguan government 
something washington has long refused to do 
it also highlights how little progress us allies in central 
america have made in negotiating ceasefires under a regional peace 
plan 
before last weeks agreement many observers doubted the leftist 
sandinistas would ever make political concessions to the 
usbacked contras 
for years the sandinistas flatly refused to talk to the rebels 
the nicaraguan government insisted the only path to peace was 
direct negotiations with the reagan administration which it saw as 
the true instigator of the civil war 
but the united states said it would only talk to the sandinistas 
after they and the contras made significant headway toward settling 
their differences 
that headway appears to have been made and after signing the 
pact wednesday in the border town of sapoa nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega renewed his call for direct talks with washington 
the last usnicaragua talks were in 1984 
now is the time for the government of the united states to 
respect the force of peace and dispose itself to normalizing its 
relations with nicaragua he said 
on friday however white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
the administration has no plans for direct talks with the 
sandinistas 
we would be willing to talk on a multilateral regional 
basis he said 
the reagan administration says it is skeptical about the 
sandinista promises made in sapoa 
in the agreement the sandinistas promised to gradually end the 
more than sixyear war restore all democratic freedoms and grant 
amnesty to political prisoners 
in so doing nicaragua could become the first central american 
nation other than costa rica which has no war and no armed forces 
to fully comply with the accord signed aug 7 1987 by costa 
rican president oscar arias ortega and the presidents of el 
salvador honduras and guatemala 
neither el salvador nor guatemala both us allies have come 
close to working out agreements with their leftist insurgents 
chronic guerrilla wars persist in both countries 
when they began the ceasefire talks last monday the contras 
and the sandinistas faced intense pressure 
overt us military aid to the rebels had recently ended and 
president reagan was having trouble convincing lawmakers that it 
should resume the cia has backed the contras since 1981 but 
congressional funding has been an onagainoffagain proposition 
the sandinistas faced pressure from chronic food shortages the 
military draft and an economy shattered by a war that the 
government says has cost more than 3 billion and killed more than 
50000 
the soviet bloc supplies the sandinistas the reagan 
administration which contends the sandinistas are the beachhead of 
a hemispheric communist threat stopped economic aid to nicaragua 
in 1981 and imposed a trade embargo in 1985 
in january the sandinistas moved to comply with arias peace 
plan by lifting a state of emergency that had barred most basic 
freedoms since 1982 
it resulted in the most open expressions of discontent since the 
leftists came to power in a 1979 revolution there have been 
demonstrations strikes media criticism and public complaints that 
the sandinistas reneged on their revolutionary pledge of democracy 
by becoming a marxist regime 
but sandinista critics in nicaragua are now praising the 
agreement with the contras in contrast to the reagan 
administrations pessimism 
perhaps the sandinista front will finally comply with its 
word said enrique bolanos head of a private enterprise council 
the contras say they will resume fighting if the agreement falls 
through 
the sandinistas in their newspaper barricada said friday the 
contra war is moving from the battleground to the political arena 
it said the contras even though disarmed continue to be 
armed ideologically against the popular power and its conquests 
arias who won the nobel peace prize in 1987 for designing the 
regional plan said the nicaraguan pact offers a new and firm 
hope that all central americans can live in peace 
the regional plan is aimed at ending the wars in el salvador and 
guatemala as well as nicaragua it calls for political amnesties 
democratic reforms and an end to support for insurgencies but 
the key provision is the one calling for ceasefires 
so far the only one to be reached in the region is the one 
between the sandinistas and the contras who suspended offensive 
military operations monday and agreed to begin a formal 60day 
ceasefire on april 1

president reagan should show his support of 
the nicaraguan ceasefire agreement by refraining from pushing for 
renewed military aid for the contra rebels a house democratic 
leader said saturday 
old policies like old habits die hard we must resist the 
temptation to say we know better by approving military aid before 
the peace plan has a chance to succeed rep tony coelho 
dcalif said in the democrats weekly radio address 
coelho the assistant house majority leader said the burden 
on president reagan is to recognize that diplomacy works and 
make peace his highest priority 
the president commenting friday on the ceasefire accord 
reached wednesday said there is reason to have caution about 
whether nicaraguas sandinista government will abide by the pact 
the sandinistas have a past record that indicates that we should 
be cautious reagan told reporters 
the administration is pushing for approval of a package of 
humanitarian aid to the contras before congress recesses for 
easter coelho said house speaker jim wright of texas is ready to 
schedule a vote this week 
if our republican colleagues help us write and pass a plan we 
can speed humanitarian aid to the contras and the chance for a

top television series such as the cosby 
show and moonlighting have had their seasons shortened and 
anxious advertisers have broken ranks to sign separate contracts as 
scriptwriters and commercial actors turn up the heat in their 
strikes 
hollywood labors spring offensive against motion picture and 
television producers and advertisers has put more than 109000 
people on strike and forced more than 1100 others out of their 
jobs due to the resulting shutdown of projects 
the action has cost workers 4 million in lost salaries and 
benefits and threatened network advertising revenue by forcing 
early reruns 
on monday the 9000member writers guild of america enters the 
fourth week of its strike against the alliance of motion picture 
and television producers 
guild spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said friday that informal talks 
were taking place between the union and producers alliance 
spokesman herb steinberg refused comment 
meanwhile 100000 members of the screen actors guild and the 
american federation of television and radio artists who work on 
commercials enter the second week of a strike against the joint 
policy committee of the american association of advertising 
agencies and the association of national advertisers 
the actors many of whom make their livings off commercials and 
advertisers have agreed to meet april 6 
of the two labor actions the writers strike has done the most 
immediate damage to the industry 
networks will be forced to show reruns as early as next month in 
order to save some new product for the critical may sweeps 
ratings period when advertising rates for local stations are 
determined 
among the shows that will fall short of a full schedule this 
season are nbcs cheers short one show la law short 
two shows and the cosby show short three episodes said david 
brokaw a spokesman for cosbys carseywerner productions 
it hurts said brokaw those were three scripts that 
werent written and three shows that wont be produced and you 
cant make those up later 
in addition nbcs saturday night live late night with 
david letterman and the tonight show will all be in reruns 
until the strike is resolved 
a muchpublicized 3d sequence for abcs moonlighting that 
was to be shown during the may sweeps will not be produced 
last weeks moonlighting episode ended early leaving the 
cast filling in with a lipsynched rendition of the rock oldie 
wooly bully stars cybill shepherd and bruce willis explained 
the script couldnt be lengthened because the writers were on 
strike 
also shut down on abc is thirtysomething one episode shy of 
a full season which is usually 25 episodes 
on cbs three shows in production were affected with 
replacement series the dictator starring christopher lloyd 
taken off the schedule for its march 15 debut only six of eight 
shows were shot for coming of age a new halfhour comedy 
the new smothers brothers comedy hour will go ahead with at 
least three shows written before the strike 
daytime soap operas usually the first affected by a talent 
union strike were able to stockpile several weeks of scripts 
although some could be in trouble by midapril 
on the advertising strike front there were signs of erosion in 
management solidarity with separate interim contracts being signed 
between sag and aftra and 41 advertising agencies and 42 production 
companies 
john mcguinn chief negotiator for the advertisers said he had 
expected the interim agreements when they sign pampg procter amp 
gamble which has a massive advertising budget ill take note 
he said 
writers struck over creative control demands for a greater 
share of residuals for foreigndistributed products and rejection 
of producers reformulation of residuals for syndicated onehour 
television shows 
writers made more than 57 million in residuals last year 
the two sides are so far apart that the producers claim their 
offer is a 50 million increase over the life of the 
threeyearcontract while guild officials claim it would be a 
378 million loss the guild says its own package would net its 
members an 87 million increase 
actors striking against advertisers want to keep a 
costofliving formula written into their contract 10 years ago 
and seek a new formula for increased residuals for commercials 
shown on cable television 
advertisers say they have offered significant increases for all 
types of fees in return for surrendering the costofliving clause

here is a text of the democratic radio address 
delivered saturday by rep tony coelho dcalif 
this is congressman tony coelho 
there is no harder decision in a nations life than to abandon a 
failed course even at a time new policies could promise success 
history is never generous in offering such moments and it seldom 
selects leaders with the wisdom to seize them 
but one such moment arrived late wednesday in a central american 
border town two hardened enemies the sandinistas and the contras 
decided to stop killing each other and signed a plan bringing 
political freedom to nicaragua america should honor this pact and 
their courage for signing it 
the contras showed great character simply by sitting down with 
the nicaraguan government days before sandinista troops crossed 
the honduran border and jeopardized the contras war supplies 
honoring engrained habits the contra leadership could easily have 
appealed to american anger and urged renewed military aid this 
they did not do 
the sandinistas also resisted the practices of the past when 
president reagan deployed 3200 american soldiers in support of the 
hondurans many predicted nicaragua would break off the peace talks 
and ask moscow for a fresh infusion of weapons such a request 
would have likely rendered nicaraguas cycle of war unbreakable 
its search for peace unachievable 
but after six years of battle and 40000 nicaraguans dead the 
sandinistas and the contras concluded that war had become a 
cowardly and costly escape from the problems of peace 
instead they negotiated an historic accord that offered a road 
to democracy for nicaragua and new avenues of aid for america the 
agreement provides a 60day ceasefire an amnesty for political 
prisoners and freedom for estranged nicaraguans to return home it 
guarantees press freedom and rights for the sandinistas opponents 
to run for political office in almost every respect this accord 
satisfies the concerns which prompted us to fund the nicaragua war 
in the first place 
the agreement bears the witness of nicaraguas cardinal obando 
and the organization of american states and it assigns the united 
states a role to ensure fulfillment under its terms we can 
provide strictly humanitarian aid to the contras providing the aid 
is delivered to the resistance forces by neutral parties 
if it works the agreement will take on the aspect of modern 
art with republicans and democrats each finding in it qualities 
that conform to their own political agendas 
any politician who wants to claim credit will surely do so but 
lets remember one central point nicaraguans from both sides of 
the civil war have closed ranks behind a blueprint for peace and 
the united states will underscore their efforts or undermine the 
agreement depending upon how we respond 
old policies like old habits die hard we must resist the 
temptation to say we know better by approving military aid 
before the peace plan has a chance to succeed the burden on 
president reagan is to recognize that diplomacy works join our 
call to end partisanship and make peace his highest priority 
speaker wright wants to put the new agreement to the test hes 
ready to schedule a vote on a humanitarian aid bill next week if 
our republican colleagues help us write and pass a plan we can 
speed humanitarian aid to the contras and the chance for a truly 
bipartisan policy toward central america would be at hand 
at another time at another struggle robert f kennedy said of 
latin america a revolution is coming a revolution which will 
be peaceful if we are wise enough compassionate if we care enough 
successful if we are fortunate enough while we cannot alter its 
inevitability he wrote we can affect its character 
this is the moment all nicaraguans have been waiting to seize 
but in a very real sense it is our moment too they have pledged 
to bury past hatreds and forge new beginnings we can do the same 
this week americans welcomed the arrival of spring and prepared 
to observe the easter and passover holidays it is a time to 
celebrate rebirth and redemption of people and the resurrection of 
a savior it is a time for renewal 
this year in the prayers of all americans let us remember the 
struggle and the sacrifice of the nicaraguan people who have known 
too much war too much repression and too little freedom let us 
hope this time that they find the peace that has eluded them for 
generations 
thank you and god bless you

here is the text of president reagans radio 
address from the white house on saturday 
my fellow americans this week as our thoughts begin to turn 
toward easter the cause of peace among nations is foremost in our 
minds a cause that was also at the top of our work agenda here in 
washington as i received soviet foreign minister shevardnadze at 
the white house 
my talks with him were cordial but as you might expect to the 
point during mr shevardnadzes stay i announced may 29 through 
june 2 as the dates for my summit meeting in moscow with the leader 
of the soviet union general secretary gorbachev and of course 
this was good news 
the last ussoviet summit in the ussr was 14 years ago so 
this meeting will give me and in a sense you the american people 
an opportunity to convey the message of peace and freedom to the 
soviet people but let me also say that while lengthy talks held 
between secretary shultz and mr shevardnadze at the state 
department were useful they also made clear how difficult the 
issues are between the united states and the soviet union 
now some progress was made here and there in various areas but 
theres much more that needs to be done given the importance of the 
topics discussed our agenda with the soviet union deals not only 
with arms reductions but also regional matters human rights and 
peopletopeople exchanges and as our discussions continue in each 
of these areas i can assure you that the united states will sign 
only those agreements that are in our best interest 
let me also assure you as negotiations continue on efforts to 
further reduce us and soviet strategic nuclear arms that my 
administration will carefully review such proposals still weve 
come a long way in our attempts to deal with the soviets and to 
further the cause of peace and freedom around the world 
the next summit will help how much well have to see an 
important accomplishment of the first few summits however will be 
before the united states senate foreign relations committee next 
week for approval this is the inf treaty on intermediaterange 
nuclear forces that mr gorbachev and i signed when he was here for 
the washington summit last december 
its an important vote and im hopeful the senate will as it 
exercises its constitutional duty speedily approve what amounts to 
the first real nuclear arms reductions ever achieved 
now some of you heard me say before that our progress with the 
soviets is based on their awareness that we have no illusions about 
them and on our determination to deal from a position of strength 
now that strength means of course keeping our defenses ready and 
second to none but it also means a strong and vigorous economy and 
a place for america as the world leader in trade 
thats one of the other matters that is being considered in the 
congress that is of critical importance that is the legislative 
conference on trade legislation last year there was trade 
legislation coming through the congress that would have meant 
serious risks to americas prosperity and indeed the worlds 
fortunately working with our administration congress has made 
some progress in producing a sounder bit of legislation now the 
legislation now before the conference committee still contains 
provisions that would restrict trade deter investment in the 
united states require mandatory retaliation that invites trade 
wars and unnecessarily hamper my perogatives as president 
for example one proposal still very much alive would create an 
obligation for the government to help each and every company that 
cant keep up with legal totally fair imports in effect an 
entitlement program for businesses that cant compete so my hope 
is that the congress will stay on course and that we will settle 
on a bill that avoids the great danger of choking off international 
trade and slowing down economic growth 
i will not sign a bill that imperils our economy and threatens 
growth and by the way that economic growth keeps coming right 
along only this week we heard that the gross national product 
growth for last year was four percent now this was higher than 
our own expectations expectations that by the way were criticized 
as too rosey a scenario when we first made them well the rosey 
scenario was even rosier than the one the critics were down on 
it just shows what can happen when spending and taxes are held 
down and trade is encouraged in fact right now much of our 
economy is being driven by the growth in exports that bad trade 
legislation would discourage so you can see theres much on our 
minds this week in washington 
and before anyone looks prematurely forward to the arrival of 
the easter bunny i hope congress will stay focused on the 
important matters this week the inf treaty and trade legislation 
until next week thanks for listening and god bless you

congressional and administration negotiators 
have agreed to give the president authority to block foreign 
takeovers of us companies if the change in ownership would 
threaten national security 
treasury department officials agreed thursday to support the 
provision in a catchall trade bill pending in a housesenate 
conference committee sen james exon dneb said friday 
the president would not be required block a foreign takeover 
but if anyone calls to the attention of the president a threat to 
national security this bill gives the president the tool to stop 
it without declaring a national emergency said exon who had 
proposed a similar measure that was approved by the senate 
he said he expected the house and senate conferees to adopt the 
compromise on tuesday 
the administration initially opposed the proposal fearing that 
the bill would chill foreign investment in the united states 
the compromise would give the president or someone he designates 
the power to investigate a takeover or a merger when a foreign 
person or company is involved 
the investigation would be limited to 45 days a provision added 
to reassure the business community that it wouldnt be prolonged 
the president then would decide whether to intervene by issuing an 
executive order 
during the negotiations several changes were made at the 
administrations insistence exon said those changes included 
dropping a provision that would have allowed congress to veto a 
presidential decision to block a takeover and the addition of 
assurances that any information obtained during the investigation 
from the us or the foreign entity involved would be kept 
confidential

armenians abandoned the streets of their capital 
to soldiers and attack dogs saturday to protest an official 
crackdown that prompted activists to cancel a nationalist 
demonstration dissidents said 
one activist said most armenians heeded the call to stay inside 
and made yerevan look like a ghost town 
there are no children outside no cars on the street no 
activity whatsoever except for the troops occupying the city 
yerevan is like a dead city said christian rights activist 
alexander ogorodnikov of moscow who said he talked to witnesses by 
telephone 
the vast majority of people in armeniandominated 
nagornokarabakh in the neighboring republican of azerbaijan also 
refused to go outside the dissidents reports said 
armenians campaigning for annexation of nagornokarabakh had 
called for protests saturday when an unofficial committee 
spearheading the drive was to meet but authorities threatened 
criminal action against those taking part in illegal protests in 
the region south of the caucasus mountains 
nagornokarabakh has been part of the overwhelmingly moslem 
azerbaijan republic since 1923 most armenians are christians and 
many fear the ethnic character of nagornokarabakh is being diluted 
in moscow armenian church official tiran gureghian said about 
15 young armenians gathered saturday at a small church inside 
yerevans armenian cemetery to discuss nagornokarabakh gureghian 
said police prevented them from going into the cemetery which had 
been posted with a sign advising visitors to obtain permits before 
entering 
an armenian telephone operator said in a phone interview that 20 
to 30 people gathered near the yerevan opera theater the scene of 
huge demonstrations last month the operator who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said that group was also talking about 
nagornokarabakh 
the operator said armenians were disappointed that their demands 
for annexation had been rejected they believed it would be ours 
it probably wont be she said 
police patrolled yerevans streets and helicopters crisscrossed 
its skies radio yerevan monitored in london appealed for calm 
and restraint 
leaders of the unofficial karabakh committee in yerevan had 
called off the strikes and demonstrations earlier in the week to 
avoid confrontation but the armenian government on friday ordered 
police to put an end to the activities of the karabakh 
committee radio moscow reported 
four armenian activists were arrested friday as authorities 
moved to prevent protests 
andrei bavitsky of the dissident journal glasnost said he was 
told nagornokarabakhs central city stepanakert was occupied by 
15000 azerbaijani policemen on saturday he said residents of the 
region were staying indoors to protest the show of force 
local authorities said little of the situation someone who 
answered the telephone at the armenian ministry of internal affairs 
refused to give his name and said saturdays activity was normal 
soviet authorities have forbidden foreign correspondents to 
travel to the area 
it was not clear how many armenians stayed home out of fear of 
confronting authorities and how many stayed home to signal their 
displeasure bavitsky said he was told 60000 troops were 
patrolling yerevan a city of about 640000 people 
a national newspaper accused the communist party leadership of 
trying to suppress the sensitive ethnic dispute komsomolskaya 
pravda said authorities should have openly discussed the proposal 
with armenians 
the critical commentary in the partys youth newspaper 
contrasted sharply with articles friday in the nations two most 
official newspapers pravda and izvestia 
despite its hard line the soviet politburo has ordered a major 
improvement in living conditions in the region including improved 
reception of armenianlanguage television programming and more 
armenian literature 
soviet authorities meanwhile allowed nationalist displays in 
latvia and estonia on friday activists said they said the 
displays marked the anniversary of soviet leader josef v stalins 
1940 deportation of thousands of anticommunists before the soviets 
took over the states on the baltic sea 
in the baltic as many as 3000 people were reported to have 
joined in a nationalist display in the latvian capital of riga and 
about 5000 in the estonian capital of tallinn 
one resident ints zalitis of riga said human rights activists 
were warned against organizing mass demonstrations he said 
latvians showed up in small groups to lay flowers at a central 
monument and police did not disturb those who left quickly 
the official news agency tass quoted latvian newspapers 
reporting several hundred people gathered around rigas freedom 
monument to make a blasphemous provocation 
nine people were detained for trespassing and disrupting 
transportation tass said

the pastor selected to lead a group of 
moderate baptists for the next year says his alliance seeks only a 
return to religious freedom within the fundamentalistdominated 
southern baptist convention 
but the moderates are willing to act independently for the time 
being if necessary said the rev john thomason elected president 
of the southern baptist alliance at its annual meeting in macon 
last week 
the group celebrated its first year of existence by poking fun 
at itself and at the fundamentalists but also worrying about what 
fundamentalist control is doing to the church 
delegates often likened the meeting to a family reunion without 
the tensions that have grown up around their denominations annual 
meeting 
the alliance meetings have reminded us of former days when 
southern baptists could gather without hostility to learn together 
and share in the gospel ministry said the rev henry crouch who 
stepped down as president of the group 
i have a home with you and do not have to explain or defend 
myself said anne thomas neil a former missionary in africa who 
was elected first vice president 
leaders of the alliance insist they do not plan to split from 
the 147million member southern baptist convention the nations 
largest protestant denomination 
at the same time however the alliance is publishing books 
setting up an office to help place moderate pastors with moderate 
congregations and discussing providing sunday school material and 
the possibilities of a new baptist seminary or divinity school 
whenever we take specific steps like that we are acting 
independently of the institutions of the southern baptist 
convention and that gives the appearance of independence said 
thomason whose 561member northminster baptist church in jackson 
miss was the third to join the alliance 
the words of some of the speakers at the meeting appeared 
intended to keep open the door for flight 
we would find it very uncomfortable to support indefinitely 
the present trend of sbc leadership crouch said in his status 
report to the delegates at mercer university a baptistsupported 
school that avoided a fundamentalist takeover attempt last year 
one sentence later however crouch was applauded when he said 
pulling out has not been our goal or intention 
thomason admitted the words and actions dont necessarily match 
but he said we have to be advocates of groups that we feel to 
be disenfranchised by the fundamentalist control of the 
denominations offices 
the alliance was formed in charlotte nc in february 1987 by 
moderates who felt shut out of their church through nine years of 
losing the southern baptist convention presidental election to 
fundamentalists 
although both groups are generally conservative they differ on 
key points and victorious fundamentalists have used the 
presidencys broad appointive powers to put their supporters on the 
boards of baptist agencies and institutions 
fundamentalists maintain that the bible is literally 
wordforword without error while moderates hold there is room 
for interpretation especially in historical and scientific 
concepts 
also fundamentalists oppose ordination of women the alliance 
has made one of its main activities welcoming female pastors 
the alliance unanimously passed a resolution supporting w 
randall lolley who resigned as president of southeastern baptist 
theological seminary in wake forest nc rather than follow the 
orders of a fundamentalistcontrolled board of directors that said 
only biblical inerrantists could be hired as professors 
another resolution decried restrictive understanding of 
scripture saying the emphasis placed on biblical inerrancy 
undermines free inquiry and diversity of opinion which have been 
a hallmark of baptist life 
alliance leaders are quick to point out that other groups within 
the denomination are political but that the alliance is 
philosophical intent on upholding what it sees as baptist 
principles 
many of the alliance leaders admit however that the convention 
election in san antonio texas next june may determine if 
moderates will retain a place in the denomination

the two lives of evan mecham embattled 
governor and wheelerdealer car salesman have emerged in the 
second act of his impeachment trial as witnesses sketch a complex 
saga of money politics and family ties 
mecham fighting to save his political life is in his second 
round of testimony in the trial as the senate considers the second 
of three charges his son dennis has stepped forward in a 
supporting role to help mecham explain why an 80000 loan from a 
protocol fund to the family car dealership wasnt illegal 
the governor admitting he was not enthused about having his 
personal finances spread out in public said he was told he could 
use the protocol fund for practically anything he wanted 
i never heard the words discussed public funds said the 
firstterm republican who is the first us governor to face an 
impeachment trial in six decades 
the senate is examining a charge that mecham misused state funds 
by borrowing the 80000 originally raised by his inaugural ball 
when state law barred his inaugural committee from using the 
funds to pay off campaign debts a protocol fund was set up 
instead to promote arizona through events and gifts to visiting 
dignitaries 
the defense contends the fund always remained private money to 
be used at the governors discretion the prosecution says it was 
clearly transformed into a public fund by an agreement between 
mechams inaugural chairman william long and the maricopa county 
attorney 
the governor whose testimony is to continue monday said long 
told him exactly what to do with the money 
mr long said we have gone through all of this rigamarole 
and you can spend it for any damn thing that you want those were 
his words except you cant spend it for politics or personal 
living expenses mecham testified 
what he used it for the prosecution contends was to save his 
auto dealership from financial disaster they presented evidence of 
overdue loans and bounced checks at the car company 
mecham and his son insist that mecham pontiac was on sure 
financial footing and that mechams only motive for borrowing the 
80000 was to increase the fund by paying higher interest than it 
was getting in a bank 
to evaluate the opposing views senators were given an education 
in the car dealership business at the end of a week in which they 
examined loan agreements and check receipts and heard about car 
floor planning and cars sold out of trust the senators who 
sit as judges and jury appeared perplexed 
mr mecham im absolutely baffled and confused state sen 
tony west told dennis mecham at the end of a long discourse on 
deeds of trust interest rates and loan agreements he questioned 
the extensive paper trail of checks linking mecham pontiac to 
assorted members of the mecham family and an organization called 
constituent communications 
asked what that group was dennis mecham 37 who received a 
15000 loan from it said he had no idea except i know my uncle 
wayne controls the checkbook 
wayne and willard mecham brothers of the governor were among 
those who loaned money in a hurry when mecham pontiac was asked to 
pay back the 80000 last oct 22 dennis mecham said the family 
loans were interestfree and were quickly repaid 
he remembered that mecham chief of staff jim colter called and 
said that a political question had arisen and the money had to 
be replaced right away but dennis mecham couldnt remember until 
he was reminded by a prosecutor what political crisis spurred the 
oct 22 call 
that was the day after phoenix newspapers broke the story of 
mechams secret 350000 campaign loan from developer barry wolfson 
the charge that mecham concealed that loan is the basis of the 
next count to be addressed at his impeachment trial and is the 
subject of felony criminal charges on which the governor and his 
brother willard face trial april 21 the first count before the 
senate involved allegations that mecham tried to halt an 
investigation of an alleged death threat by a member of his staff

an american photographer stood trial 
saturday on drug smuggling charges and testified that his only 
crime was being stupid enough to let a cocaine ring dupe him into 
doing its dirty work 
the trial of 23yearold conan owen whose case has drawn the 
attention of attorney general edwin meese iii began and ended 
saturday the threejudge panel that took testimony for 2 hours 
wasnt expected to issue a verdict for about a week 
the freelance photographer from annandale va is charged with 
smuggling 413 pounds of cocaine into spain in a suitcase on march 
13 1987 
james kibble a special agent for the us drug enforcement 
administration testified that owen was tricked by a drug 
trafficking ring into carrying the cocaine owen he said is 
innocent or stupid but innocent 
the prosecution is asking for 10 years in prison on contraband 
charges and on charges owen violated public health laws that 
prohibit the transport or sale of dangerous drugs 
the defense contends owen thought the suitcase only contained 
travel brochures photographs and film 
owen a 1986 graduate of syracuse university and a former summer 
intern in vice president george bushs office has spent the past 
year in barcelonas 85yearold model prison without possibility of 
bail 
he told the court saturday that he carried a suitcase to 
barcelona from santiago chile for george barahona an 
equadoreanborn naturalized american who was living near 
washington dc 
owen said barahona represented himself as one of the owners of 
the sorosa travel agency near washington dc and offered him 
1000 to take travel brochure pictures in spain owen said 
barahona gave him a suitcase to take with him which he believed to 
contain the brochures and film 
the suitcase contained 200000 in cocaine 
owen told the court he had always obeyed the law and 
acknowledged he had been stupid but that is not a crime 
judge jose presencia rubio who heads a threemember panel 
hearing the case refused to admit as evidence testimony about a 
polygraph test owen took 
owens lawyer ana campa said the test administered by a dea 
agent indicates owen was telling the truth when he said he knew 
nothing about the drug 
federal agents allege barahona is part of a drug ring that moves 
cocaine from south america to spain 
on feb 5 barahona pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to 
smuggle drugs in us district court in alexandria va 
he received a twoyear suspended sentence after providing 
information that led to the indictment of three spaniards and three 
bolivians in a conspiracy to smuggle illegal drugs they remain at 
large 
when meese came to spain to sign an annex to a 1970 extradition 
treaty feb 9 he handed over copies of barahonas testimony to 
spanish judicial authorities 
prosecutor teresa calvo called only two witnesses the 
paramilitary civil guard on duty at el prat airport who discovered 
the cocaine and the chemist who analyzed the drug as being 84 
percent pure cocaine 
assistant us attorney justin williams of alexandria va 
testified for the defense that statements obtained from barahona 
following the pleabargain arrangement indicated owen had 
unwittingly taken the cocaineladen suitcase to spain 
he barahona specifically told us that conan owen had no 
knowledge that there was cocaine in the suitcase he carried into 
barcelona airport march 13 williams said

the 3200 american soldiers sent to 
honduras on an emergency mission 10 days ago are training up to the 
last minute before they begin an airlift home a us military 
spokesman said saturday 
maj gary hovatter us public affairs officer at palmerola air 
base said the troops were training at four sites throughout this 
country of 45 million people palmerola is about 40 miles 
northwest of the capital 
were just training down to the wire its nothing exotic 
hovatter said in a telephone interview 
he said about 6000 american soldiers currently are stationed in 
honduras including the 3200 from the 82nd airborne division at 
fort bragg nc and the 7th light infantry division at fort ord 
calif who will begin the trip home monday 
president reagan rushed the soldiers to honduras on march 17 and 
18 after sandinista troops from neighboring nicaragua reportedly 
entered honduras in pursuit of usbacked contra rebels 
the us government billed the current military presence in 
honduras an emergency training exercise meant both as a show of 
support for honduran president jose azcona hoyo and a warning to 
the leftist sandinistas against further actions in the region 
but the nicaraguan government denied sandinista troops were 
inside honduras and charged that the americans came to honduras in 
order to leave behind weapons and equipment that the contras could 
use 
hovatter said saturday that three auditors from the general 
accounting office were staying at palmerola the headquarters for 
us military operations in honduras to ensure that the all the 
equipment brought in by the americans got back to the united states 
the equipment includes two sheridan tanks a dozen 105mm 
howitzers more than 100 machine guns several thousand m16 
automatic rifles mortars and ammunition 
there will be a full accounting of all ammunition hovatter 
said 
tensions rose in the region after the american troops arrived 
however and the honduran air force said it twice bombed the bocay 
border region inside honduras where sandinista activity was spotted 
hovatter said saturday the exercises here nicknamed golden 
pheasant have been productive because they gave american 
soldiers the opportunity to practice in the field

soviet and american representatives agreed 
on how to defuse international tensions at a justended special 
session that marked unparalleled cooperation between the 
superpowers but it was only on paper 
the soviets and americans were students 
they met at tufts universitys fletcher school of law and 
diplomacy in a un security council conference mockup unlike 
their diplomatic counterparts at united nations headquarters they 
found quick solutions to delicate problems 
take the gulf war for instance 
it took months last summer for the real security council to draw 
up a resolution with language acceptable to both superpowers the 
twoday mock meeting which ended saturday accomplished the same 
feat in just hours 
the two sides at the mock session also found common ground on 
southern africa and the israelioccupied territories issues that 
have split east and west at the united nations for years 
and unlike the normally somber ponderous affairs at the real 
security council the simulated meeting also generated laughter 
applause and a palpable sense of enthusiasm 
i think you can get an objective idea of the positions of 
different countries said vladimir titov a 25yearold from the 
moscow state institute on international relations at the same 
time we learn to understand each other 
the americans also were enthused 
its working beautifully said pam burianek 25 from 
atlanta we are really experiencing a great rapport with the 
soviets who are here 
four soviet students and four from the fletcher school were 
paired to act out the negotiating and maneuvering of a security 
council meeting they joined 22 other students from other colleges 
and countries to represent the 15 member nations of the security 
council 
the soviets came to the united states under a program sponsored 
by the us united nations association and the united nations 
association of the soviet union 
spokesman jim muldoon of the privately funded us united 
nations association suggested the event had more than symbolic 
significance because students later would use the lessons they had 
learned 
at least on the soviet side many of them will be brought into 
the foreign ministry he said many of the students that are at 
the school from elsewhere are already in their ministries 
for burianek who wants to join a nonprofit international 
organization after graduation the shaking of hands the eye 
contact the upfront discussion will remain as impressions with 
much more educational value that something thats in books 
titov who teamed up with fletcher student alison avery to 
represent communist bulgaria said he was most impressed by the 
cooperation of the ussoviet teams despite different ideological 
backgrounds 
now i know its possible to bridge any gap he chuckled 
both of us are working very hard for bulgaria here

the us 
navy saturday escorted its 40th convoy of reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
into the persian gulf followed by merchant vessels from other 
nations seeking informal us protection against an upsurge in 
attacks by iranian gunboats 
a procession of as many as nine vessels including two american 
warships three usflagged tankers and at least four nonus 
ships slipped through the strait of hormuz and past the iranian 
gunboat base at abu nusa at 11 am local time where the convoy 
briefly encountered an iranian warship that steamed down the 
majestic line of vessels 
the navy was assigned only to accompany the ships flying the 
stars and stripes but its presence appeared to suspend for a while 
the iranian warships radio challenges to merchant shipping that 
often fall victim to iranian gunboats in the iraniraq tanker war 
the parade of five us ships included two kuwaiti tankers the 
290085ton middletown a products carrier and the 46723ton 
liquefied gas carrier gas princess and the 39000 ton mv courier 
a us navy fuel tanker 
the escort was provided by this guided missile frigate making 
one of the last voyages in the gulf before returning home to long 
beach calif 
four unidentified tankers joined the convoy as hitchhikers as it 
passed through the socalled silkworm envelope a 100mile stretch 
of the hormuz passage where vessels come within the 60mile range 
of silkworm antiship missile batteries installed by iran a year 
ago but never fired 
some of the ships turned off on other courses as they cleared 
what comdr john j kieley iii skipper of the reuben james calls 
the worm hole 
as the convoy approached the next perilous stretch the waters 
around the abu musa island base for iranian gunboats two more 
tankers lined up behind the american group the line of vessels 
with middletown in the lead and reuben james directly behind it 
extended four miles long 
kieley of huntington beach calif said it was commonplace for 
nonus flag tankers to tag along with american convoys in the 
narrow strait but it is sometimes hard to tell whether theyre 
actually trying to join us everybody has to go use the same 
traffic separation channels in the strait 
as the convoy neared the abu musa area the frigate peeled 
sharply out of its slot just behind the lead ship middletown 
surged ahead at 25 knots and maneuvered into a position to screen 
the convoy from an iranian navy ship the bushehr which had turned 
up in the area issuing radio challenges to other commercial 
vessels to identify themselves and their destinations 
farther back in the convoy the frigate samuel b roberts did 
the same 
as the bushehr a 3100ton supply ship approached on the 
reuben james starboard side kieley radioed him to state your 
intentions 
the iranian replied this an is iranian warship we are in 
normal patrol in this area of international waters 
kieley told him to stay clear of the convoy the bushehr 
held to its passing course about two miles away 
in rapidfire sequence an iranian aircraft also showed up on 
the radar approaching abu musa from about 48 miles away from the 
convoy 
but the flurry of activity eased as quickly as it had developed 
the american warships fell back in line as the bushehr vanished 
behind the approaching aircraft were identified as nonhostile 
the small boats proved to be fishing craft

that several arab states pressured him to accept a us plan for 
middle east peace but he rejected it anyway 
arafat did not name the arab nations but said he would ask 
leaders at an arab league conference next month to renew their 
backing of the plo as the sole legitimate representative of the 
palestinian people 
arafat said his movement rejects any middle east peace 
initiative that does not recognize his group as such including the 
plan put forward by secretary of state george p shultz 
america still says no to the plo no to the palestinians 
right to selfdetermination no to the palestinian state no to 
the representation of the plo at this conference arafat declared 
at the news conference at his heavily guarded military headquarters 
near baghdad we say no to this american position 
shultz has called for interim negotiations possibly beginning 
may 1 and subsequent broader peace talks aimed at settling the 
arabisraeli dispute the discussions would be designed to return 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip to palestinian 
control while providing security for israel 
shultz will travel to the middle east next week to push the 
initiative 
arafat declined comment on meetings shultz held saturday in 
washington with two members of the palestine national council the 
plos parliament in exile us officials refuse to meet members of 
the plo which they view as a terrorist group 
the americans launched their effort after antiisraeli violence

former president carter applauded secretary of 
state george shultzs meeting saturday with two american members of 
the palestine liberation organizations legislative body and said 
he should have met with them long ago 
israeli officials angrily charged that shultz was violating a 
longstanding us commitment not to recognize or negotiate with 
the plo as long as it refuses to acknowledge israels right to 
exist but carter said shultz is not violating anything 
shultz conferred for one hour with the two palestinianamericans 
at the state department to hear their views on shultzs latest 
middle east peace plan the two professors edward said of columbia 
university and ibrahim abu lughud of northwestern university are 
members of the palestine national council the plos 
parliamentinexile 
state department spokesman charles redman stressed that said and 
lughud are us citizens who did not characterize themselves as plo 
members he said the meeting was not a negotiation but a very 
useful exchange of views that represented no change in us 
policy toward the plo 
carter interviewed at a luncheon of business and government 
officials at gannett co inc headquarters in suburban arlington 
va said he knew said and lughud personally they are very 
constructive in nature carter said theyre american citizens 
theyre not radicals 
we dont have any obligation not to meet with palestinian 
leaders the former president said the obligation we have is 
not to recognize the plo officially and not to negotiate with the 
plo and secretary shultz is not violating any commitment 
carter said shultz should have met with them long ago as 
part of the reagan administrations efforts to arrange arabisraeli 
peace talks he said he hoped that shultzs belated effort will 
succeed 
carter endorsed shultzs proposal for a preliminary 
international conference on the middle east convened by the five 
permanent members of the un security council the united states 
the soviet union china britain and france 
under shultzs plan a joint jordanian and palestinian 
delegation would attend the conference with israel and other 
mideast parties 
carter said such a conference is favored by the leaders of 
egypt syria jordan the overwhelming number of palestinians and 
half the israelis 
if such a conference were held carter predicted the arab and 
israeli leaders would be very moderate and constructive in their 
presentation because it would be their one chance to have the 
world listening to their best arguments 
the former president who has conferred extensively with middle 
east leaders since he left the white house in 1981 also endorsed 
shultzs call for direct arabisraeli peace talks after the 
international conference with the aim of finding a way to grant 
selfrule to the 15 palestinian arabs living in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
carter said deadlocks in bilateral talks between israel and its 
arab neighbors could be referred to a wider conference for 
discussion of new ideas 
he said the security council members would be charged with 
guaranteeing enforcement of any mideast settlement and together 
with such wealthy nations as japan and saudi arabia would help 
finance the substantial costs of a settlement carter estimated 
those costs at about 15 billion over five years 
carter said a peace settlement wont be easy to achieve but he 
insisted that the potential is there for accommodations on both 
sides 
he warned that it is almost impossible to break down these 
barriers without a firm and persistent commitment from washington 
and thats what we have been missing for the last seven years 
under president reagan 
it may be that secretary shultzs belated effort will be 
successful carter said i sincerely hope and pray that it 
will

no knees is bad news say eight male 
students who wore miniskirts to protest a ban on shorts 
i would like to know what is wrong with the boys knees 
said alicia williams mother of kennith miller sent home from 
jacksonville high school on friday along with classmates who wore 
miniskirts with hems a few inches above their knees 
and why are they enforcing the dress code on boys when girls 
can wear skirts up to their hips she continued if girls can 
show their legs why cant boys 
principal james johnson said the schools dress code allows 
skirts but bars shorts and halter tops he said he sends home any 
girl who wears a miniskirt that is too short or revealing but that 
he has bent the rules by allowing male students to wear jams 
or shorts that end below the knees 
ms williams said the style nowadays is to wear jams at knee 
level or a little above 
the boys said they thought their protest was a humorous way to 
make a point 
i dont find it humorous at all johnson said they were 
interfering with the educational process parading around and 
disrupting classes 
johnson said the protest hurt his feelings the boys should have 
talked to him about the problem before wearing skirts to school he

a life of privilege and promise came to an end 
saturday as robert chambers left his comfortable manhattan home for 
the city jail to await sentencing for killing a teenage girl 
during a central park tryst 
shortly after 10 am under gray and rainy skies the 
21yearold chambers and his lawyer rushed past a horde of 
reporters outside his upper east side apartment and sped away in 
the back of a black limousine 
chambers was processed at manhattan criminal court and then 
delivered early saturday afternoon to the hospital at rikers island 
where he will be held in protective custody until his formal 
sentencing april 15 
defendants in cases that have received wide publicity are 
routinely segregated from the city jails general population and 
held in the hospital said ruby ryles spokeswoman for the city 
correction department 
after sentencing chambers will be transferred to the state 
prison system 
chambers reluctantly pleaded guilty friday to firstdegree 
manslaughter bringing a surprise end to his murder case 
throughout 10 weeks of trial he had insisted he killed 18yearold 
jennifer dawn levin accidentally during a rough sexual encounter in 
central park early on the morning of aug 26 1986 
the case with its elements of fastlane lives of easy sex 
drugs and drink offered a glimpse into the lifestyle of some of 
the citys most privileged youth 
chambers a former altar boy and preparatory school graduate 
and later a college dropout and drug addict had been charged with 
seconddegree murder in miss levins death 
but he pleaded guilty to the manslaughter charge friday evening 
and admitted he had intended to hurt miss levin the night he killed 
her 
the plea proposed by chambers lawyer jack litman was part of 
a deal that included burglary charges against chambers and calls 
for a sentence of five to 15 years in prison 
the bargain was justified by the district attorneys office 
because the jury appeared headed for a deadlock after nine days of 
deliberations 
one of the jurors michael ognibene expressed great relief 
at having the trial over saturday 
im satisfied said ognibene who works for an international 
banking concern to me it proves the justice system works

secretary of state george p shultz trying to 
invigorate a mideast peace plan met saturday with two members of a 
group affiliated with the palestine liberation organization and 
will travel to israel and four arab countries next week to push the 
initiative 
shultz will arrive in jerusalem april 3 for talks with israeli 
leaders and move on to jordan syria saudi arabia and egypt before 
returning to washington on april 8 state department spokesman 
charles e redman said 
were intensely involved in this process and were going to 
continue to push forward to do everything we can redman said 
asked if there had been any progress in getting other nations 
approval of the plan since shultz returned from his last trip 
march 5 redman asserted no one has said no our proposal is 
still on the table people are actively and seriously considering 
it 
shultzs return trip will give us a chance to continue to do 
what it is weve been trying to do which is to see if we can be 
helpful in getting this this middle east peace process underway 
redman said 
he said shultz decided to make the trip friday night after 
meeting his chief mideast envoy philip habib who recently toured 
the area 
the us initiative calls for interim negotiations beginning 
perhaps by may 1 and eventually more intensive talks designed to 
return the west bank and gaza to palestinian control and to assure 
security for israel 
while none of the countries in the region has rejected the plan 
outright they have all expressed dissatisfaction with some of the 
proposals 
one of the stickiest points has been arranging for 
representatives of the palestinians to take part in the talks the 
palestinians want to be represented by the plo but israel will not 
meet that group and there also is a us law against dealing with 
the plo which the united states has declared a terrorist 
organization 
the united states has sought to find representatives who would 
be acceptable to both sides and include them in a jordanian 
delegation to any talks 
plo chairman yasser arafat told a news conference in baghdad 
iraq meanwhile that he rejected pleas by several arab states to 
accept the shultz plan because it does not recognize his 
organization as spokesman for the palestinians 
america still says no to the plo no to the palestinians 
right to selfdetermination no to the palestinian state no to 
the representation of the plo at this conference arafat said 
we say no to this american position 
in what appeared to be a bow toward the palestinians shultz 
invited two american members of the palestine national council 
the plos selfdescribed legislative arm to an hourlong meeting 
at the state department saturday 
israeli officials denounced the talks as a violation of a us 
commitment not to meet with the plo prime minister yitzhak shamir 
had protested the meeting to us ambassador thomas pickering 
negotiator on mideast problems 
the guests edward said a columbia university professor and 
ibrahim abu lughud of northwestern university said they complained 
to shultz about israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
where 111 arabs have been killed in recent demonstrations 
one of the major aspects of our interest in seeing secretary 
shultz was to relate to him directly as palestinians our 
extraordinary unhappiness our anger at the repressive measures 
taken by israel said told reporters 
we also made clear to the secretary that all palestinians 
regard the united states as directly involved in the repression 
since it is clear to everyone that the united states supports 
israel and supplies it militarily and economically to an 
unprecedented degree he said 
he and lughud also reiterated the arab view that the plo headed 
by arafat is the sole legitimate representative of the palestinian 
people 
both redman and the two pnc members were repeatedly asked by 
reporters after the meeting if they considered shultzs invitation 
a deviation from the us policy of not dealing with the plo 
these gentlemen did not characterize themselves as members of 
the plo redman said he said the meeting did not represent a 
change in us policy and he stressed the fact that the visitors 
are us citizens 
this was not a negotiation he said this was a very 
useful exchange of views as far as the secretary was concerned the 
secretary of course explained our proposal and what it is were 
trying to accomplish in working with the parties in trying to 
advance the peace process 
the visitors agreed that they were not negotiators or designated 
representatives of the plo 
at the same time they likened the palestine national council to 
a national congress and said it plays an important role in plo 
decisionmaking they also said they had been in contact with 
arafat about the meeting 
this is probably one of the rare times that the secretary of 
state in practice is dealing with palestinians in exile and 
therefore the message that ought to be understood by this is that 
there is a palestinian people irrespective of location that must 
be involved in the peacemaking process lughud said 
before heading to israel next sunday shultz will spend the 
weekend in rome meeting italian officials and taking part in 
easter celebrations

black fbi agent donald rochon an alleged 
victim of racial discrimination at the hands of fellow agents was 
also victimized by bureaucratic footdragging and a possible 
coverup by federal criminal investigators looking into the case 
his lawyer says 
rochons story of racial harassment portions of which have 
been upheld by an administrative judge at the equal employment 
opportunity commission and an adjudication officer at the justice 
department has been widely publicized 
another part of his story that also could prove damaging for the 
government is how rochons supervisors at the fbi and officials at 
the justice department allegedly failed to aggressively follow up 
his complaints 
a justice department spokeswoman deborah burstionwade 
declined comment saturday on the specifics of rochons allegations 
saying the department is investigating the case but she did say 
that it is not unusual for any thorough investigation to take 
months to complete 
rochons lawsuit against fbi and justice department officials 
says that in early 1986 he was unable to persuade his superiors at 
the fbi office in chicago to investigate as a criminal matter death 
threats he had received from fellow agents 
the suit alleges that he received anonymous obscene letters 
threatening him with mutilation and death and threatening his wife 
with sexual assault the suit also charges that a fellow agent 
forged rochons name on an application for an insurance policy 
covering death and mutilation 
rochon also has said he received a picture of a badly beaten 
black man in his office mail and that a picture of a monkey or ape 
was pasted over the faces of his children in a photograph that he 
kept on his desk 
fbi director william sessions has characterized rochons 
complaints about harassment as extremely serious and said that 
racial discrimination has absolutely no place in the fbi and will 
not be tolerated 
rochon alleges in his suit that he was assured at one point that 
his complaints were being followed up but that he soon found out 
otherwise 
in frustration in april 1986 rochon went outside the fbi 
sending a packet of material concerning alleged racial harassment 
at the chicago fbi office to the justice departments office of 
professional responsibility 
two months later the office referred rochons allegations to 
the justice departments civil rights division 
to determine whether criminal action would be appropriate the 
divisions criminal section asked the fbi to launch a criminal 
investigation of rochons claims 
the ensuing fbi probe was a paper review rochons attorney 
david kairys said in an interview 
in a court filing this month the justice department said the 
fbi conducted 75 interviews in its criminal probe but kairys says 
he was told that all of the interviews were conducted last summer 
following an eeoc decision that declared that rochon had indeed 
been discriminated against when he served in the omaha neb fbi 
office in 1983 and 1984 
this investigation it seems clear was a sham from the start 
kairys said they never took the allegations seriously and they 
never intended to really investigate and only started interviewing 
people when they faced extreme embarrassment 
it wasnt until last december the month after rochon sued fbi 
and justice department officials that the fbi referred its 
evidence in the criminal probe back to the civil rights division 
at about that time the justice department initiated a grand 
jury investigation of rochons complaints 
rochons lawsuit says the justice department and the fbi used 
the criminal probe as a basis to sidetrack two administrative 
complaints rochon had pending before the eeoc in connection with 
alleged discrimination while he was serving at the chicago office 
rochon got a letter from an fbi official saying that the justice 
departments civil rights division didnt want interviews in the 
administrative proceedings taking place while the criminal 
investigation was under way 
the fbi suspended action on the administrative eeoc matters 
regarding rochons service in the chicago fbi office 
no further action will be taken concerning the processing of 
your complaints until such time as we are advised to proceed by 
the civil rights division an fbi official wrote rochon in august 
1986 
in its court filing this month the justice department said that 
as a matter of standard business practice the criminal section 
of the justice departments civil rights division seeks to ensure 
the integrity of potential criminal proceedings by requesting that 
civil investigations be stayed if they relate to the same events 
that are the subject of the criminal proceedings 
court rulings say that certain compulsory statements taken from 
law enforcement personnel in administrative proceedings could not 
be used in subsequent criminal proceedings against them

evidence presented in a new jersey court that 
cigarette makers were aware up to 40 years ago that smoking might 
cause cancer and other ailments will lead to a flood of 
tobaccoliability cases attorneys said saturday 
the attorneys including one involved in the new jersey trial 
said they expected the documents would lead to the first verdict 
against a tobacco company in a productliability case and now that 
the documents are a matter of public record their availability 
will substantially reduce the cost of pretrial proceedings in other 
cases the attorneys said 
this is a product that is as dangerous as alcohol and as 
addictive as heroin said professor richard daynard of the 
tobacco products liability project at northeastern university 
the evidence shows that 
the project which assists attorneys involved in suits against 
tobacco companies brought together lawyers involved in more than 
100 tobacco liability cases nationwide as part of its fourth 
anniversary conference 
a lawyer for cigarette maker philip morris cos one of the 
defendants in the new jersey case said daynard and other attorneys 
at the conference were taking the documents out of context the 
attorney charles r wall also criticized the group for discussing 
them while the new jersey was still under way 
these issues will be decided in the courtroom where they 
should be decided wall said we disagree that there has been 
proof that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer 
daynard and others at a northeastern news conference said past 
cases blaming smoking for deaths have failed because of 
insufficient evidence that tobacco companies knew smoking was or 
possibly was a health hazard 
the documents gathered for the new jersey trial include internal 
tobacco industry memos dating back to 1946 in which researchers for 
cigarette makers discuss growing evidence of a link between smoking 
and lung cancer and heart and respiratory problems 
they also include verification that cigarette makers developed 
less dangerous cigarettes and memos in which the companies are 
advised that marketing those products would amount to an admission 
that other cigarettes were dangerous 
don davis an attorney in a mississippi tobaccoliability case 
that ended in a mistrial in january said he hopes to use some of 
the documents as evidence at the retrial 
william townsley a lawyer from beaumont texas called on 
congress to investigate the tobacco industry he charged that 
cigarette makers flouted laws that require manufacturers to warn 
consumers of hazards or potential hazards of their products 
wall maintained that tobacco industry documents discussing 
possible health risks were part of industry reviews that contained 
conflicting opinions 
i dont believe these documents are incriminatory in any 
way he said they show that the industry was concerned about 
the charges against the product 
alan darnell one of the attorneys representing the estate of 
rose cipollone in the new jersey suit against three cigarette 
makers said the tobacco industry has a history of funding new 
studies of the harmful effects of smoking to create the impression 
that the link between smoking and health problems is inconclusive 
they did worse than doing nothing he said what they did 
was a sham 
the cipollone case is expected to go to the jury in may she 
died of lung cancer in 1984 at the age of 58 and had smoked for 40 
years

sometimes its hard to tell whos really on 
trial in the federal racketeering case against rep mario biaggi 
dny and six other men 
sen alfonse damato and rep robert garcia arent on trial or 
even charged with wrongdoing but a key prosecution witness spent 
much of last week telling jurors how he made at least 30000 in 
illegal campaign contributions to damato and helped pay 80000 to 
garcia 
attorney general edwin meese iii isnt on trial either but the 
witness former wedtech vice chairman mario moreno also 
testified the company paid an additional 800000 to a close friend 
and former lawyer of the attorney general for his influence with 
ed meese 
defense lawyers in their crossexamination of moreno have 
hammered at his admitted illegal acts in their effort to prove that 
wedtech corrupted an entire administration and didnt need to 
bribe biaggi for his help 
biaggi his eldest son his law partner and four others are 
charged with turning wedtech a south bronx defense contractor 
into a racketeering enterprise that paid out millions of dollars to 
obtain and then hold onto government contracts 
wedtech currently in bankruptcy proceedings grew from a small 
machine shop into a 100millionayear business through a series 
of nobid contracts set aside for minoritycontrolled companies 
moreno has linked the defendants to numerous payoff and fraud 
schemes and also admitted personally stealing 15 million in 
company funds moreno is among four exwedtech officials 
cooperating with the government in return for leniency on state and 
federal charges to which they pleaded guilty 
a damato spokesman branded morenos testimony ridiculous 
and prosecutors have said the senator will testify for the 
government 
the prosecution contends that biaggi enlisted the help of 
damato and other politicians to help secure nobid contracts for 
wedtech then extorted millions of dollars in wedtech stock as a 
payoff 
moreno claimed wedtech paid 80000 to garcia at the request of 
the congressman and his wife for political favors and political 
introductions garcia later denied the allegation through a 
spokesman 
moreno also testified that wedtech paid 800000 to san 
francisco lawyer e robert wallach a close friend of the attorney 
general for his influence with ed meese 
according to the witness wallach said he had gotten meese then 
presidential counselor to intercede for wedtech in contract 
negotiations with the pentagon and commerce department 
moreno also said he and another wedtech official offered wallach 
200000 to fix the wedtech investigation wallach said he would 
take a look and told us we were not going to go to jail moreno 
testified adding that wallach never got back to them and the money 
was never paid 
moreno also said wedtech paid 130000 to two bronx bankers in 
early 1984 for helping the company obtain a 500000 cash loan at 
150000 interest over three months from a bronx businessman an 
additional 15000 to a manhattan banker manhattan banker who 
helped them launder the 500000 cash 1000015000 over six 
years to a a manager at consolidated edison a local utility to 
have con edison on our side whenever we needed it and 100000 
to two teamsters officials in 1985 to settle a dispute with another 
union

said indirectly that the united states is meddling in panamas 
internal affairs by trying to oust panamanian strongman gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
we urge that through reflection and dialogue it be the 
panamanian people who determine their political future de la 
madrid said

central america during two days of talks in this caribbean resort 
with guatemalan president vinicio cerezo

his references to reagan administration efforts in panama were 
clear 
we two presidents de la madrid and cerezo are very worried 
by the present situation in which panama is suffering 
destabilization he said 
of course we condemn any foreign intervention that aims at 
destabilizing panama and interfere in political matters that are 
the sole concern of the panamanian people he added

green laser fire ripped through the mist and the 
faithful heard the words theyve been waiting to hear 
if we republicans can let that future into our hearts we 
can i am certain become the leaders of the congress of tomorrow 
house minority leader bob michel of illinois who spoke the 
words isnt moses and the laser show at the johnson space center 
doesnt equal lightning on mount sinai but republicans are longing 
to enter the promised land of congressional control they came to a 
conference in houston to find the key 
about 70 gop lawmakers visited the space center the texas 
medical center and institutes of higher learning that have made 
houston a technological haven after years of being the complainers 
and naysayers on capitol hill they are searching for something 
they can champion and capture the imagination of the american 
public 
you dont get votes by just saying the democrats are mean to 
us said rep lynn martin rill who heads a committee working 
to overcome the democrats 255177 advantage and win the house back 
to the gop 
like the desertwandering israelites of old the republicans 
have seen an entire generation move on during their exile from 
power not a single current gop member was serving the last time 
the speaker of the house was a republican 34 years ago 
with their threeday congress of tomorrow conference which 
ended saturday house republicans launched a campaign to become 
known as the party of the future 
public investments in technology and education were the themes 
of the weekend including meetings with businessman h ross perot 
supercomputer scientist paul chu heart surgeon michael debakey 
and workers at an oil refinery 
secretary of education william bennett urged republicans to take 
the issue of quality education away from the democrats 
americans are really quite republican and conservative when it 
comes to education he said alluding to the backtobasics 
movement in the schools 
rep jack buechner of missouri the only republican to unseat an 
incumbent house democrat two years ago said he was working to 
convince fellow republicans and vice president george bush 
accepted here as the obvious nominee of the party that a strong 
space and science plank was needed in the party platform 
rep newt gingrich rga enthusiastically pointed out that at 
the same time the republicans were exploring 21st century ideas 
here democratic presidential candidates were campaigning in 
michigan with a promise of trade protectionism for industrial 
technologies of the past 
but as much as they wanted to look toward the future the 
republicans found in houston a healthy dose of the present 
instead of the expected address on his latest heartsurgery 
breakthroughs dr debakey gave the lawmakers a lecture on the need 
for stray dogs and cats in medical research and asked them to 
oppose animal rights legislation 
michels keynote address at the space center rapped what he 
called backward looking democrats and trade protectionists sony 
television cameras taped the speech and when lawmakers went later 
to buy nasa lapel pins they said made in canada on the 
back 
the citys oilbust economy could be viewed only a short walk 
from the plush conference hotel 
entire neighborhoods seemed nearly vacant with many houses 
boarded up and dilapidated as the policeescorted bus motorcade 
roared to one of the events one man held out his upturned hat as 
though begging for money 
a planned outing saturday to the new wortham performing arts 
center had to be canceled when police found what they thought was a 
bomb it was later discovered the device was harmless 
houston special operations sgt john scroggins described the 
object as a pipe about five or six inches long two inches in 
diameter that had caps on both ends 
a party was held friday night at the el mercado del sol a mall 
created to help the hispanic community but which has been mostly 
empty and financially troubled 
privately it was conceded that one republican leader had 
questioned whether houston was the symbol they were seeking the 
organizers of the event which was paid for largely by corporate 
sponsors were clearly disappointed that less than half the house 
republicans attended 
even the most optimistic lawmakers said it was unlikely the gop 
could take over the house before 1992 when a postcensus 
redistricting could throw many seats their way if the party 
succeeds in gaining control of key state legislatures 
the plight was illustrated by the two fundraisers held during 
the weekend for republicans bailing out of the house to seek the 
senate 
rep beau boulters quest to unseat sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
is a long shot and rep trent lotts campaign for the mississippi 
slot held by sen john stennis the senior democrat who is 
retiring is even more indicative of the house republicans morale 
troubles 
lott 46 is the republican whip which means he would have 
become party leader after michel decides to step down lott said 
his decision to run for the senate was mostly because of the 
opportunity afforded by stennis retirement and personal reasons 
but he condeded his decision might have been different 
if i thought that we had the prospect of having a majority in 
the house next year or in four years certainly that would be a 
factor he said 
rep joe barton rtexas said he was optimistic but realistic 
you win these things one step at a time he said were 
ready the question is when 
all the republicans were hoping they wouldnt have to be as 
patient as indicated by the laser computergenerated image of james 
madison that spoke to them at the space center 
god speed to you founding fathers of the 21st century it 
said

former president jimmy carter criticized 
president reagan on saturday for proclaiming the innocence of 
former national security aides oliver l north and john m 
poindexter indicted on criminal charges in the irancontra affair 
carter told a meeting of government and business leaders that 
reagan showed a callous attitude toward the principles of law 
enforcement when he said friday that north and poindexter would 
be found innocent of the charges and that he still thinks north is 
a hero 
i think they violate basic principles of law enforcement in 
this country for the chief law enforcement officer that is 
president reagan in case youve forgotten to make the statement 
that indicted persons are guilty in his opinion or not 
guilty carter said at a meeting held at gannett co inc 
headquarters in suburban arlington va 
north and poindexter along with arms dealers richard v secord 
and albert a hakim pleaded innocent thursday to charges of 
consipiracy theft and fraud in the irancontra case 
reagan has said previously he did not think any laws were broken 
in the irancontra affair 
in what seemed to be an offthecuff response to a question 
posed from the audience after a speech to young people friday 
reagan said i just have to believe theyre going to be found 
innocent because i dont think they were guilty of any lawbreaking 
or any crime 
i still think ollie north is a hero the president said

attorney general edwin meese iiis personal 
finances are under investigation to see whether there was an 
unexplained amount of money coming to him a newspaper reported 
saturday 
the primary purpose of the investigation is to determine whether 
meese derived any benefit or promise of benefit from his 
relationship with his longtime friend e robert wallach while 
wallach was representing wedtech corp and the promoters of a 1 
billion iraqi oil pipeline the los angeles times reported 
the inquiry under the supervision of independent counsel james 
c mckay is comparable to an internal revenue service net worth 
examination conducted in cases in which persons are suspected of 
not having paid taxes on substantial illicit gains the los angeles 
times said 
the purpose is to see and analyze whether there was an 
unexplained amount of money coming to mr meese the newspaper 
said quoting an unidentified source familiar with the 
investigation 
however nathan lewin a lawyer representing meese said it 
would be the most outrageous thing in the world to draw a 
negative inference about meese because of the type of 
investigation under way 
lewin said the investigation focuses on transactions made before 
1985 when meese invested his funds with san francisco financial 
adviser w franklyn chinn in what the attorney general described as 
a limited blind trust 
the times said investigators were looking at how chinn turned 
meeses investment of about 50000 into 95000 within 18 months 
a return exceeding 80 percent 
wallach meeses former lawyer and chinn who was introduced to 
meese by wallach were indicted dec 22 on federal charges of 
defrauding wedtech a nowdefunct defense contractor based in new 
york at the time mckay said there was insufficient evidence to 
indicate meese was involved in any criminal activity in connection 
with wedtech 
meese has acknowledged intervening with the pentagon in 1982 at 
wallachs request to be sure wedtech got a fair hearing in its 
effort to win an army engine contract 
investigators are also scrutinizing meeses moves to arrange a 
meeting between wallach who had been hired by a major financier in 
the iraqi oil pipeline project and robert c mcfarlane who was 
president reagans national security adviser at the time the times 
said

sobbing elderly women clad in black 
begged president george vassiliou saturday to help locate hundreds 
of greek cypriots who disappeared during the turkish invasion of 
cyprus 14 years ago 
it was vassilious first official encounter with the anguished 
relatives of missing greek cypriots since he was elected last 
month he assured the families he would do everything possible to 
speed up procedures to end your ordeal 
more than 2000 people packed a downtown nicosia movie theater 
for the meeting with vassiliou 
the meeting was organized by the committee of relatives of the 
missing after turkish prime minister turgut ozal declared last 
month there were no greek cypriots missing in the turkish sector of 
the divided mediterranean island 
vassiliou is a native of famagusta a port city that now is part 
of the turkishheld eastern zone 
speakers told the meeting there has been no progress in efforts 
to determine the fate of the 1619 greek cypriots missing since 
turkey sent troops into cyprus in july 1974 
turkey said it acted to protect turkish cypriots after greek 
cypriot militants temporarily seized power from the cypriot 
governnment turkish cypriots later declared their zone a republic 
but only turkey has recognized that move 
we want to know if our children are dead or alive one woman 
shouted at the meeting weve been living in anguish for 14 
years 
many of the missing disappeared after the international 
committee of the red cross had listed them as prisoners of war in 
camps in turkey 
theres no doubt the responsibility for determining the fate 
of your missing loved ones lies with turkey vassiliou said 
a special united nations committee appointed in 1984 to try to 
trace the greek cypriots and 600 turkish cypriots also listed as 
missing has failed to determine what happened to them 
vassiliou said he will ask un secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar to make the committee more effective 
the un groups failure was due to a lack of sincere 
cooperation by the turkish side said the rev christophos 
papachristoforou a greek orthodox priest and president of the 
relatives committee 
turkey holds the key and our aim must be to find a way to 
force it to cooperate said papachristoforou who has four sons 
among the missing

the case of a 23yearold american 
photographer tried saturday on charges of drug smuggling has 
hightlighted differences between the legal systems and national 
customs of spain and the united states 
conan owen a 1986 graduate of syracuse university was charged 
with smuggling more than four pounds of cocaine from chile to spain 
in a falsebottomed suitcase he received the suitcase from a 
travel agent near his home in annandale va 
both prosecuting attorney teresa calvo who asked for a 10year 
jail sentence and presiding judge jose presencia rubio expressed 
incredulity that a university graduate would accept a job from a 
passing acquaintance and agree to carry a suitcase halfway around 
the world for someone he hardly knew 
in spain the custom is only to do business with people you know 
during his year in barcelonas 85yearold model prison owen 
said he didnt understand why he had not been freed on bail pending 
trial bail was denied because owen was a foreigner caught with a 
substantial amount of relatively pure cocaine 
when us law enforcement agents testified saturday that owen 
had provided them with information leading to a half dozen 
indictments of members of a suspected cocaine smuggling ring the 
judge called it all very interesting but said he was only 
interested in owens case 
attorney general edwin meese iii even delivered copies to 
spanish judicial authorities of a statement made by george 
barahona the man who hired owen and who early last month received 
a twoyear suspended sentence for narcotics violations from a 
federal court in virginia 
in the statement made in a plea bargain agreement barahona said 
owen knew nothing about the drugs and had been used as a carrier 
but plea bargaining does not exist in spain 
in her summary calvo implied that plea bargaining was a 
lessthanhonorable institution 
us officials faced a similar problem several years ago when a 
spanish court was considering us and spanish requests for 
extradition of colombian cocaine baron jorge luis ochoa vasquez 
the us indictment of ochoa who was arrested in madrid in 
november 1984 was based on extensive testimony obtained through a 
plea bargin 
the spanish court instead sent ochoa back to colombia in july 
1986 he went free a week later

an underage world war ii soldier dubbed 
the boy hero who was decorated for shooting down japanese 
aircraft and helping shipmates in two battles says his age was 
both a blessing and a curse 
at age 12 calvin graham was one of this countrys youngest war 
heroes 
for his exploits which will be the subject of a twohour 
television movie sunday night graham was awarded a bronze star and 
a purple heart 
but his youthful looks and a bureaucratic error landed him in 
the brig and cost him his medals it took him over 30 years to win 
back his decorations and the former gunner now 58 and a resident 
of a fort worth suburb is still seeking disability benefits for 
his war injuries 
the son of sharecroppers graham left home after his father died 
in a traffic accident and his mother remarried he said his 
stepfather beat him and his brother and then threw them out of 
their houston home when they tried to fight back 
graham shined shoes and sold newspapers to make money until he 
joined the navy in july 1942 enlisting with the aid of forged 
papers that claimed he was 17 he was sent to the uss south dakota 
for a pacific tour 
assigned to a 40mm gun crew on the ships fantail graham helped 
shoot down about 300 enemy planes launched from five japanese 
aircraft carriers in the battle of santa cruz 
grahams gunnery officer asked him his age when he congratulated 
the crew 
i told him i would be 13 in april graham said according to 
a story in the fort worth startelegram he was shocked and i 
knew i had made a mistake but i was proud of what we had done and 
i felt like i was 6foot tall i didnt care at the time if people 
knew how old i was i felt like i had done what i set out to do 
later graham tried to tell the officer he had been kidding but 
the boy hero was called before the ships captain who told him he 
would have to go back home 
he told me it wasnt anything to be ashamed of he had already 
sent three others back that same day but i stuck to my story and 
claimed i was 17 graham said 
he said well you may have wished you took me up on this in 
the next 24 hours graham remembered we were headed for 
another battle 
at guadalcanal an enemy ship knocked out grahams gun with a 
14inch shell and he was assigned to help the wounded the ship 
later took 47 hits on its superstructure 
everyone who was in there that night was either killed or 
wounded said graham i went up there and there were guys 
hands and arms and legs floating around in the water the bloody 
water was waisthigh 
exploding shrapnel hit graham in the mouth but he continued to 
help medical officers attend to injured crewmen 
graham received the bronze star for his actions when his ship 
returned to brooklyn naval yard in new york the captain gave him 
leave to get a notarized letter from his mother permitting him to 
stay in the navy despite his age 
but when graham returned with his letter he was told instead by 
an executive officer to turn himself in to naval authorities in 
houston he was sent to the brig at the naval air station in corpus 
christi for over a month and treated like a deserter because 
authorities thought he was really 17 and trying to lie about his 
age he also had his medals taken away 
then the navy admitted its mistake and released graham after his 
13th birthday giving him a cancellation enlistment with 
honorable conditions but the navy did not return his medals 
years later graham enlisted the support of rep jim wright and 
sen lloyd bentsen and won his honorable discharge from the navy 
and reinstatement of his medals but he is still denied disability 
benefits for his war injuries 
now confined to a wheelchair and crutches because of injuries he 
suffered after the war while a legitimate member of the marine 
corps graham monitors the status of proposed legislation that 
could restore his war benefits corresponds with former shipmates 
and writes stories of his experiences he helped write some of the 
material for too young the hero to air on cbs

about 8400 gallons of slightly 
radioactive water leaked into the hudson river from the indian 
point no 2 nuclear power plant the plants operator said saturday 
the water was discovered missing from a 345000gallon storage 
tank outside the containment structure said bea meltzer 
spokeswoman for consolidated edison 
its really a minuscule amount that is undetectable because 
river water normally contains a small amount of ambient or 
background radiation said meltzer 
the discovery was made saturday morning but officials were 
unsure how long the leak had existed 
carl abraham a spokesman for the nuclear regulatory commission 
said the leak posed no health hazard 
the radioactivity in the water he said was about onetenth 
of 1 percent of what they would be allowed to release to the river 
if they did it on purpose in a scheduled discharge 
the leak in a steam line allowed water from a refueling water 
storage tank to leak into a nonnuclear boiler and condenser 
system then into the river said con ed spokesman john mccann the 
leak was stopped by closing valves on the line 
the incident had no effect on operations at the plant located 
roughly 25 miles north of the new york city line mccann said

troops loyal to gen manuel antonio 
noriega raided panama citys port area saturday and cleared it of 
barricades set up by striking dockworkers the army threatened 
force to make the nations banks reopen 
banks ignored the threats and dockworkers stayed away from work 
as part of a general strike called by opposition leaders to force 
noriega from power 
troops also raided several flour mills and shut down a union 
hall 
noriega announced friday that soldiers would seize flour from 
the nations mills apparently to distribute it to panamanians who 
have been short of food because of the strike 
defiant mill owners retaliated by announcing they were donating 
the flour to the roman catholic churchs food program for the 
needy but troops began raiding the mills before donations could be 
made 
esther kwaiben treasurer of the churchs program said more 
than 13 million pounds of flour stored in the mills apparently had 
been taken to government warehouses 
at the harinas panama mill the general manager tirso 
wolfschoon his wife and other company employees were arrested at 
general mills de panama troops kicked out all the employees and 
took over the plant 
noriega opponents got a boost when groups representing 55000 
retirees announced they will join nationwide street demonstrations 
which the national civic crusade has called for monday 
we will block the streets of this country let the president 
come and speak to us in the street said retiree manuel escudero 
the crusade is made up of about 200 political parties 
professional groups and student and labor unions it was formed 
last june for the sole purpose of forcing out noriega 
noriega controls panama through the 15000member defense forces 
which he heads but that control could weaken the longer his 
soldiers go without pay their payday was friday but because of 
panamas current cash crisis they didnt receive money 
armed troops raided the capitals port before dawn moving aside 
several ship containers that had been blocking the entranceway to 
the docks since march 14 when the ports 300 workers went out on 
strike because they had not been paid 
a few hours later the nearby union headquarters was wired shut 
and scores of workers who had been keeping vigil disappeared 
national port director general diomedes concepcion denied reports 
that some had been arrested 
the port had to be opened concepcion told reporters adding 
if not we are aiding the enemy 
noriega reiterated threats to force banks to hand over an 
estimated 70 million in their vaults so the government could pay 
its troops 
but the panamanian bankers association which groups 90 of the 
118 panamanian and foreign banks operating in this country 
rejected the request 
the governments request does not solve the problem of the 
fiscal and financial crisis of the nation that has deep political 
roots said a statement by the group 
panama ran short of cash last month after the reagan 
administration blocked all panamanian funds in the united states 
including revenues from the panama canal 
the reagan administration recognizes eric arturo delvalle now 
in hiding as panamas legitimate president noriega supporters in 
the national legislature ousted delvalle who had been the civilian 
president on feb 26 after delvalle tried to fire noriega 
since then street demonstrations and a general strike have 
failed to push noriega out of power 
the strike has shut down more than 90 percent of the nations 
industry cash and food are in short supply 
in a decree made public saturday the government declared a 
moratorium on all rent payments the gesture was a hollow one 
since people have not been paying their rents for more than a month 
because of the cash shortage 
most supermarkets and drug stores remained closed saturday 
defying a warning from the noriega regime the previous day that 
they would lose their business licences if they did not reopen 
the panama canal so far has not been affected by the turmoil

the vaticans official newspaper on saturday 
denounced as tragic and startling the decision by a swedish 
hospital to set an age limit for radiation treatment of cancer 
victims 
in a frontpage editorial losservatore romano described as 
antihuman the recent decision by stockholms radiumhemmet cancer 
clinic to refuse radiation treatment of patients over 70 because it 
said it lacked sufficient resources 
without going into the merits of the technical and financial 
problems that the states health service has to confront in very 
civilized sweden there remains the tragic and startling decision 
left to the discretion of a head physician the newspaper said 
the editorial compared the action to the aberration of 
euthanasia and added to let die on a humanitarian pretext such 
as relief from suffering or to let die for an opportunistic 
calculation based on age are two sides of the same coin 
it said the swedish case is even more alarming for the bleak 
greyness of the motivations lack of equipment financial cuts by 
the state lack of personnelthe substance is that the life of a 
man is no longer the normative worth for a doctor 
the only criteria for discrimination would be age would there 
then be an age in which life ceases being the most precious gift 
losservatore romano also commented on abortions in britain 
an editorial said the vatican hoped that a move in the british 
parliament to prohibit lateterm abortions would be the first step 
toward a complete ban by britain on abortions 
a bill before parliament would reduce the time limit for 
abortions from 28 weeks to 18 weeks the measure is now in 
committee

i promise you i will carry the battle lance of our people 
until the black hills are once again ours forever more phillip 
j stevens of irvine calif told a crowd of more than 600 people 
who attended a ceremony at the rosebud sioux indian reservation 
stevens who wore fringed buckskins decorated with indian 
beadwork was given a shield and headdress made of imitation eagle 
feathers and the name man who walks with the shield he could not 
receive real eagle feathers under federal law because he is not an 
enrolled member of a sioux tribe 
the plan to make stevens a special chief to lead the land battle 
was pushed by members of the grey eagle society a group of sioux 
elders and other traditionalminded indians

which under federal law is done by an elected president and council 
at the ceremony stevens smoked a sacred pipe with oglala sioux 
chief oliver red cloud northern cheyenne chief austin two moons of 
montana and other leaders after singing and praying 
we seek to injure no one in south dakota we only seek the 
return of lands that are rightfully owned by the lakota sioux 
people stevens told reporters 
they the black hills are sacred to the sioux people they 
are our altar to god it is like stealing their church he 
said of the rugged area of western south dakota 
the federal government signed a treaty in 1868 saying 73 
million acres of the region belonged to the sioux but then 
abrogated the treaty and took the land after gold was found in the 
black hills 
stevens supports a bill that would give the sioux over 1 million 
acres plus money but says more money is necessary to improve 
living conditions on reservations where unemployment reaches 85 
percent 
however not all sioux believe stevens has earned the right to 
become a special chief and a historian said its an unprecedented 
title some argued stevens was not an enrolled member of any sioux 
tribe and has not substantiated his claim to be a greatgrandson of 
sioux warrior standing bear 
opponents also said he is splitting the indian community and 
could damage efforts to regain the land 
on friday the black hills sioux nation treaty council filed for 
a temporary restraining order in federal court in rapid city to 
make stevens prove he is of indian descent or stop making the 
claim the council advises the eight sioux tribal councils on 
treaty issues 
the complaint said stevens is impersonating an indian 
claiming indian heritage that is questionable 
no ruling was expected until sometime this week at the earliest 
stevens said at saturdays news conference that he had given 
sioux leaders an affidavit signed by his father saying standing 
bear was his greatgrandfather two members of the standing bear 
family appeared at the ceremony saturday to support stevens 
another supporter homer whirlwind soldier said at the ceremony 
that stevens would have the status to negotiate with federal 
officials for land we send a general in to fight a general so 
we give mr phillip stevens the symbol of authority 
stevens told reporters that he and other sioux chiefs will ask 
interior secretary donald p hodel to meet with them and set up a 
public hearing on the issue 
stevens acknowledged that only one of the seven tribal councils 
that support the return of the black hills has endorsed his 
proposal and the plan to make him a special chief but he said a 
petition signed by sioux people in south dakota indicates he is 
supported by a majority 
i think that the will of the people has been neglected by the 
people elected to do the will of the people stevens said 
stevens is an engineer who played a role in development of the 
minuteman iii before he founded ultrasystems inc in irvine 
calif in 1969 he recently sold the 160 millionayear 
engineering company to devote his time to the black hills effort 
stevens 58 supports legislation introduced by sen bill 
bradley dnj that would return 13 million acres of federal 
land in the black hills to the sioux 
the black hills region was deeded to the sioux in the fort 
laramie treaty of 1868 but after gold was discovered by an 
expedition led by lt col george armstrong custer prospectors 
swarmed in and the treaty was abrogated in 1877 the indians were 
forced onto reservations in less desirable parts of the state 
the supreme court in 1980 upheld a settlement for the land 
which with interest has grown to nearly 200 million most of the 
sioux tribal governments have refused the money saying they want 
the land 
bradleys bill would return about 13 million of the land 
covered by the original treaty it applies only to federal land in 
the area of timbering mining and tourism and does not include 
mount rushmore 
stevens argues the sioux also should get up to 31 billion for 
their loss of revenue since the land was taken 
bradleys bill introduced two years ago and still not out of 
committee is opposed by south dakotas congressional delegation 
many backers of bradleys bill say stevens plan to seek 
additional money would wreck the bills chances in congress

a lawmaker called for a government inquiry 
saturday after the body of a guided missiles engineer was found 
inside a car filled with exhaust fumes the latest in a mysterious 
string of deaths of british scientists 
trevor knight 52 who was found dead friday was the eighth 
british scientist involved in defenserelated work to die in 
unusual circumstances since august 1986 
doug hoyle a member of parliament for the labor party said he 
would ask defense secretary george younger to order an urgent probe 
of the deaths and report the findings to parliament 
what is the link between all these hoyle asked is it not 
surprising what is happening to top scientists 
is it simply overwork or is there something more sinister 
afoot 
the government so far has rejected an inquiry saying there was 
no evidence to suggest the deaths were linked other than by 
coincidence 
a defense ministry spokeswoman said saturday that any 
investigation would have to be done by police on a casebycase 
basis 
knight who worked in the guided missiles division of the 
marconi electronics firm was found in a car parked in a garage at 
his home in harpenden 25 miles northwest of london after he 
failed to report for work 
hertfordshire police said the car was filled with exhaust fumes 
but gave no details chief inspector chris partridge said however 
that the death was not being treated as suspicious a phrase 
british police use for a suspected suicide 
marconi spokesman ray bryant confirmed knight worked in the 
guided missiles division of the companys stanmore plant 
bryant refused comment on the fact that five of the scientists 
worked for marconi a major british defense contractor or an 
affiliated company 
the string of deaths began aug 5 1986 when vimal dajibhai 
24 was found dead in a gorge beneath a bridge in bristol the 
inquest returned an open verdict meaning there was insufficient 
evidence to establish a cause of death 
dajibhai was a junior software engineer checking torpedo 
guidance systems at marconi underwater systems in watford near 
london 
the other deaths were 
ashhad shariff a computer systems analyst working for another 
marconi unit near london who was found strangled in october 1986 
in a park near bristol an inquest ruled he killed himself by tying 
one end of a rope to a tree and the other to his neck then driving 
off in his car 
richard pugh a computer designer found dead in his essex home 
in january 1987 under circumstances police never have explained 
peter peapell a lecturer at the royal military college of 
science at shrivenham who was found dead in february 1987 beneath 
his car with the engine running and the garage doors shut the 
coronors report was inconclusive 
david sands who was working on an air defense systems contract 
for easams a marconi affiliate died in march 1987 when he drove 
his car loaded with tanks of gasoline into a vacant restaurant 
victor moore 46 a marconi scientist who died of a drug 
overdose in april 1987 his wife told an inquest he had been under 
strain in his job at marconi space and defense systems in 
portsmouth 
russell smith 23 a lab technician for britains atomic energy 
authority whose body was found feb 1 halfway down a cliff at 
boscastle in western england police found a note but have not 
disclosed its contents

counterdemonstrators 
the rallies were organized by a group calling itself the pledge 
of resistance which claims 80000 supporters nationwide 
about 1500 people marched in the rain in boston saying they 
backed the signing last week of a ceasefire in nicaragua between 
the leftist sandinista government and the usbacked contra rebels 
we have to make it clear to the government that theres no way 
were going to go for giving aid to the contras right now said 
lauren voloshen a spokewoman for the central american solidarity 
association which sponsored the boston rally 
the counterdemonstration was staged by about 30 members of 
young americans for freedom who shouted peace through 
strength 
more than 2000 demonstrators rallied peacefully in front of san 
franciscos city hall as part of the national day of emergency 
protest 
youre strong and youre right city supervisor nancy walker 
told the cheering crowd adding that demonstrations in the united 
states helped lead to the end of the vietnam war 
demonstrators in civic center park across from the city hall 
held signs reading stop reagans war no contra aid and 
hands off nicaragua as the protesters marched cross town to 
gates of the presidio army base their ranks swelled to 5000 and 
a few demonstrators lobbed eggs toward police officers at the base

a man who became the first coloradoan to 
cite the states make my day law after he shot and killed a 
neighbor was found guilty saturday in the unrelated murder of his 
estranged wife 
david guenther 35 showed little emotion as an adams county 
jury found him guilty in the death of his wife and the attempted 
murder of her friend in march 1987 the jurors had deliberated for 
three hours 
it made my day said prosecutor bruce levin in a reference 
to an earlier case in which guenther achieved notoriety as the 
first person to invoke colorados law allowing homeowners to use 
deadly force against intruders 
the law was nicknamed after a line in a clint eastwood film in 
which a detective invites a criminal to make my day and give 
the detective an excuse to shoot 
authorities dropped the charges against guenther in the 1986 
shooting death of a neighbor and the wounding of two other people 
on the basis of that law he shot the three after his wife got into 
an argument with them on the guenthers front porch 
however a higher court later reversed that ruling tightening 
the criteria under which homeowners could claim immunity from 
prosecution under the law guenther than was acquitted of all 
charges in the case last fall basing his argument on selfdefense 
rather than the make my day rule 
levin who called guenther a murderer who cant keep his story 
straight in closing arguments saturday said the guilty verdict 
was supported by the evidence and it was a just verdict 
prosecutors said earlier they would not seek the death penalty 
sentencing was set for may 
guenthers estranged wife pamela was killed and a friend 
stanley stinson was shot several times outside a restaurant in 
commerce city on march 1 1987 the guenthers two children ages 
11 and 13 witnessed the shootings and testified at their fathers 
trial 
guenther initially denied any involvement but later claimed he 
shot the two because he saw them kissing guenthers attorneys 
argued he shot the pair in an act of passion and without 
premeditation 
prosecutors maintained the shootings were part of a pattern of 
threats and violence by guenther against his wife testimony showed 
he had taken mrs guenther hostage at their home one week before 
her death violating a court order to stay away from her he 
released her unharmed after a standoff with police that lasted 
several hours 
guenther was free on bond from that incident when his wife and 
stinson were shot

lord carrington nato secretarygeneral said in a 
report published sunday he doubts that nuclear weapons will be 
totally abolished 
i am not optimistic that you can ever get rid of nuclear 
weapons altogether i am not sure it would be a good thing anyway 
because they are the ultimate deterrent he was quoted as saying 
in an interview with londons sunday express weekly 
i am sure though that we can all live at a much lower level 
of armaments and one of the reasons i am optimistic is that it is 
very much in mr soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs interests 
to do that he said 
carrington will be 69 when he retires from his post with the 
north atlantic treaty organization in july 
he told the express the west cannot disarm on its own expecting 
the soviet union to do the same 
the agreement reached by president reagan and gorbachev at a 
december summit in washington for the superpowers to eliminate 
mediumrange nuclear weapons and for continued talks on chemical 
weapons and reducing longrange missiles were originated by nato 
carrington said he added that gorbachev contrived to let it be 
thought that all these initiatives are actually his because of 
the superiority of sovietbloc conventional forces in europe the 
idea that you can maintain a deterrent which is obsolete is not an 
idea which makes any sense he said

the defense department has scaled back its 
plans to develop a massive space security shield and instead has 
settled on a far less ambitious immediate goal of protecting us 
military installations the washington post said in sundays 
editions 
the newspaper said the department five years and 12 billion 
after president reagan launched the strategic defense initiative 
sdi program has abandoned plans to try to protect us cities 
as well as its military centers from a soviet attack 
the post quoted senior us officials as saying that the 
decision to concentrate on a limited defensive system reflects 
broad agreement within the administration that the presidents 
dream cannot be attained 
the threat of a ballistic missile attack will not be diminished 
in the foreseeable future the officials told the post which did 
not identify them 
the reorientation of reagans sdi program also known as star 
wars was revealed in part by a 1987 joint chiefs of staff 
classified document calling for developments and deployment of a 
defensive system to stop only 30 percent of the nuclear warheads in 
a massive soviet first strike the post said 
the fourpage secret document accepted the view of sdi officials 
that even this limited defense would help deter a soviet attack 
the paper said however if this american view turns out to be 
wrong and the soviets initiate a massive first strike the system 
the pentagon now envisions may stop only 1500 nuclear warheads 
allowing as many as 3500 others to penetrate and wreak devestation 
on us and allied territory the post said 
the newspaper said sdi officials believe this limited defensive 
system could be deployed beginning in 1996 at a cost of up to 150 
billion in current dollars double the expense they predicted last 
year 
many scientists and military experts however question whether 
the defensive weapons being pursued in the sdi program will be able 
to achieve even the scaledback goals the paper said 
the post cited us officials as saying the soviets may have 
sensed the course of internal american decisionmaking over sdi and 
predicted that reagans dream would be abandoned causing them to 
tone down their public criticism of sdi in recent months and 
tolerate more aggressive sdi research under a potential new arms 
pact

massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
overcame a strong showing by jesse jackson in the final weekend of 
democratic caucuses to win north dakotas presidential preference 
poll saturday 
dukakis had 629 votes to jacksons 416 with two rural districts 
left to be counted saturday and sunday in the precinct caucuses 
which are the first step toward picking 15 of north dakotas 
national convention delegates another 467 people voted uncommitted 
missouri rep richard gephardt received 393 votes followed by 
illinois sen paul simon with 145 and tennessee sen albert gore 
jr with 130 other candidates received a total of 57 votes 
gephardt had been backed by fellow house member byron dorgan 
north dakotas lone representative in the house 
if those results hold up at the state convention next month 
dukakis will win five national convention delegates from north 
dakota jackson will gain three and gephardt two another five 
delegates would be uncommitted 
ellen austin state campaign coordinator for dukakis said north 
dakota voters liked his stands on agriculture and health care 
issues the endorsement of sen kent conrad also helped she said 
we are more than pleased at the super showing mike has shown 
in north dakota ms austin said 
we cant see how dukakis can lose the democratic 
nomination she said and i would like to predict he will be 
elected the 41st president of the united states 
the precinct caucuses elect delegates to attend legislative 
district conventions which are held immediately after each caucus 
is adjourned the district conventions will elect 1372 delegates 
to the state convention where 15 of north dakotas 20 delegates to 
the democratic national convention will be selected next month 
while people attending the caucuses express preferences for 
presidential candidates the delegates to the state convention 
often label themselves instead on the basis of their sentiment on 
various state issues such as agriculture or labor 
the outcome however does reflect the presidential preferences 
expressed at the first level of the process said state party 
chairman george gaukler 
one small town planned to hold its meeting sunday but the 
outcome would not affect the overall statewide result

democratic presidential caucuses

into it if he had been white he wouldnt be dead today 
moore said he wouldnt cooperate with authorities because he didnt 
trust them 
stone said he knew nothing about threats against pierce 
pierce was liked by all he had no enemies that i know of 
the sheriff said it took a very mad person to commit a 
crime like that 
nothing appeared to have been stolen from the house stone said 
robert morgan director of the state bureau of investigation 
said we dont have any motive morgan said he believed pierce 
lived alone 
authorities believe that the shooting occurred between midnight 
and 6 am the sheriff said 
the red springs police department received a call about the 
death saturday morning said chief deputy al parnell of the robeson 
county sheriffs department 
authorities received the first word of the death from a 
friend of pierce said morgan who would not identify the caller 
fbi agent paul daly said agents from the fbi and the state 
bureau of investigation were assisting county investigators 
we will look into it from the aspect that it could be a 
potential civil rights violation said daly in charge of fbi 
operations in north carolina 
he had a real good chance to be elected said the rev 
elbert chavis i dont think he had any enemies he was a fine 
man he would have been elected all we want now is a thorough 
investigation 
at midafternoon the body was still in the house in a rural 
area about 15 miles from lumberton as forensic experts combed the 
scene the body was later transferred to a hospital morgue in 
lumberton and officials said it would be transferred to the state 
medical examiners office in chapel hill on sunday for autopsy 
robeson county bordering south carolina in the southeast corner 
of north carolina is the home of the robesonian newspaper where 
two lumbee indians were charged with holding the staff hostage feb 
1 the men charged with hostagetaking eddie hatcher and tim 
jacobs said they wanted to call attention to racial injustice and 
corruption in the county 
a letter written by hatcher before the hostage incident 
criticized the robesonians coverage of pierces announcement for 
the judgeship the letter which was published in the weekly 
carolina indian voice newspaper in january said pierces story 
didnt receive as prominent display as did britts announcement 
but robesonian editor bob horne said both candidates received 
frontpage display with a photograph 
the protesters also cited the death of a black jail inmate in 
january and the shooting death of an unarmed indian in november 
1986 the indian was shot by deputy kevin stone the sheriffs son 
in an incident that a coroners jury later ruled to be an 
accident andor selfdefense 
robeson countys population of 100000 is 37 percent white 37 
percent indian and 26 percent black blacks and indians long have 
alleged racism and corruption in the local criminal justice system 
britt who is known for the number of deathpenalty verdicts he 
has won has been a frequent target of the complaints 
i was shocked and dismayed by the death of mr pierce britt 
said in a statement released to the robesonian on saturday his 
murder was so senseless and violent it is very sad and tragic and 
i extend my personal condolences to his family and friends 
he declined further comment to the newspaper and there was no 
answer when telephone calls were placed to his home saturday 
evening 
saturday evening about 100 people gathered at an elementary 
school outside lumberton for a meeting called by various local 
officials and clergymen in an effort to calm citizens feelings 
the meeting closed to the press broke up quietly after about 2 
hours 
jack morgan a county commissioner said he asked for the 
community to remain calm and let justice take its course he said 
participants suggested that the county commission ask the state 
attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor in the case and 
vowed to bring such a proposal to the county group monday 
because of the meeting he said i feel a little better about 
what they will do in their communities tomorrow 
earlier a crowd of about 60 people mostly lumbee indians 
stood outside pierces onestory brick ranch house many said they 
believed the slaying was politically motivated and that they didnt 
have much faith that the sheriffs department would investigate the 
killing adequately 
morgan said im sure that there are those who share that 
feeling but if they dont trust the county the sbi and the fbi i 
dont know who else we can turn to

city health officials are ready to begin 
clinical trials on drugs to treat aids victims but are prevented by 
cumbersome federal policies the citys chief health officer told a 
presidential commission on friday 
we could do community trials wed be happy to we could get 
clinical trials with controls going tomorrow dr david werdegar 
director of the citys health department told members of the 
presidential commission on the human immunodeficiency virus 
epidemic 
largescale clinical trials that could begin at san francisco 
general hospital community hospitals and the university of 
california health science center are prevented by a national 
cooperative drug trial policy werdegar called leadfooted 
the national policy is unduly long and cumbersome said 
werdegar who estimated the citys 4514 aids patients will 
increase to as many as 18000 by 1993 
as our own projections show only too well time is of the 
essence he said 
former mayor dianne feinstein who also testified during the 
second day of the commissions threeday stay in san francisco 
urged the panel to eliminate the use of placebocontrolled trials 
in patients with aids where possible 
science protocols must not be used to deprive individuals with 
these fatal conditions of possible relief from suffering 
feinstein told the seven commissioners 
she also called for national civil rights legislation barring 
discrimination in housing jobs medical care and insurance 
coverage against people with aids 
despite local ordinances aids patients are still summarily 
fired from jobs evicted from apartments and denied insurance when 
people learn of their conditions said feinstein who left office 
in january 
cities such as san francisco which has spent 50 million since 
1981 to fight aids more per capita than any other city in the 
nation will not be able to keep pace with the epidemic unless 
federal grants to cities increase feinstein said 
meanwhile several blocks away at united nations plaza 
demonstrators including angela davis joined supporters of the 
citys aidsarc vigil who chained themselves briefly to the doors 
of the old federal building in a protest against president reagans 
response to aids 
the money that should be used toward an extensive system of 
education around aids and toward development of a national health 
plan for every single person is going into the war machine said 
davis a member of the communist party of the usa which helped 
organize the demonstration 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
as of monday 57024 cases had been reported to the us centers

the unsponsored afghanistan peace talks went 
into weekend recess on an upbeat note friday after word came that 
the superpowers were softening their positions on key issues 
the soviet union was said to have dropped its objections to a 
pakistani proposal to let un mediator diego cordovez play a role 
in getting the process under way of forming a transitional afghan 
government 
the united states signaled new flexibility in trying to resolve 
a second major problem concerning future military aid to parties in 
the 8yearold afghanistan war 
a western source speaking on condition of anonymity said 
cordovez asked both washington and moscow to assign highranking 
officials to a new search for a compromise in the aid issue there 
was speculation he wanted the cochairmen of a special ussoviet 
working group to concentrate on the problem 
that working group was set up at the washington meeting between 
secretary of state george shultz and soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze this week they named michael armacost us 
undersecretary of state for political affairs and anatoly 
adamishin a soviet vice foreign minister as cochairmen 
cordovez told reporters negotiations will resume monday 
he met with both the pakistani and afghan delegations after a 
senior us official said in washington that the interim government 
issue was now swiftly soluble the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said thursday that moscow indicated support 
for having cordovez act in a personal capacity to promote an 
infraafghan dialogue 
pakistan argues that only such a government replacing the 
sovietbacked one headed by president najib could oversee 
implementation of a peace settlement and ensure the safe return of 
more than 5 million afghan refugees 
moscow and its kabul allies maintained that the question of 
afghanistans future government was not a subject of geneva talks 
and any attempt to link its formation with the settlement would be 
interfering with afghanistans internal affairs 
last week the chief pakistani negotiator acting foreign 
minister zain noorani indicated a modified position he told 
journalists pakistan wants signing of a settlement accompanied by 
an allround commitment to the principle of forming such a 
government cordovez might subsequently convene a meeting between 
the afghan factions 
originally according to a pakistani source this was also 
vetoed by moscow 
the first indication that moscow had dropped its objections came 
at shultzs wednesday news conference he said the united states 
welcomes the development through which mr cordovez will in a 
personal capacity be ready to serve as mediator among the 
contending parties 
shultz in turn seemed to be taking a more flexible stance on 
washingtons demand that soviet military aid to the kabul 
government cease at the same time as us aid to the islamic 
antimarxist guerrillas fighting it the soviets said that amounted 
to interfering with relations between two sovereign states bound by 
international treaties 
shultz suggested in washington that both sides agree at least on 
a temporary freeze on arms assistance or on something close to 
it he said this would ensure stable conditions during the 
projected withdrawal of the estimated 115000 soviet troops from 
afghanistan 
the secretary said the soviets did not feel they could agree 
to that but he made plain his hope that moscow would have second 
thoughts saying the us proposal remains on the table 
special soviet envoy nikolay kozyrev called on cordovez friday 
feeding rumors that there was movement in what the senior us 
official in washington termed the only unresolved issue

rep james howard of new jersey the 
influential chairman of the house public works and transportation 
committee died friday a day after suffering a heart attack while 
playing golf he was 60 
it was very peaceful and he experienced no pain his 
daughter marie howard said in a statement 
howard a democratic member of the house for 22 years collapsed 
thursday on a suburban maryland golf course doctors at montgomery 
general hospital in olney md labored for nearly two hours to get 
the lawmaker breathing on his own he was then rushed by helicopter 
to the cardiac unit at washington hospital center 
he never regained consciousness a statement issued by his 
office said howard died of complications from the heart attack his 
third 
funeral services were scheduled for tuesday at st catharines 
roman catholic church in spring lake nj 
reaction to howards death was quick 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said jim always said he was 
inspired by president kennedy to enter public service and was one 
of the most effective and loyal supporters that john and robert 
kennedy and i ever had 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said of howard he worked 
hard played hard loved his family his state and his country with 
a burning intensity 
reps glenn anderson dcalif and john paul hammerschmidt 
rark the two ranking members on the public works panel issued a 
joint statement saying no person ever has done more to build 
this nations backbone its highway and public transit network its 
dams and sewage treatment plants its airports and its buildings 
transportation secretary james burnley said in a statement he 
was a knowledgeable and effective lawmaker who was above all a 
dedicated public servant 
howard was known among colleagues as one of the houses toughest 
horse traders he was an aggressive and agile lawmaker who wielded 
his considerable clout in an oldfashioned behindthescenes way 
he was instrumental in passage of the clean air and clean water 
acts and fought to end ocean pollution and to protect his largely 
coastal new jersey district from the ravages of erosion 
when stricken on thursday howard was in the company of one of 
the literally hundreds of lobbyists seeking to curry favor with his 
influential committee 
the spring lake heights nj democrat was an avid golfer he 
had a fondness for cigarettes and coffee 
howard excelled at eyeballtoeyeball negotiations with other 
members using his clout to make deals or to push his position 
despite his power howard has sometimes held a tentative grip on 
his seat during the reagan landslide of 1980 he won reelection 
by a margin of only about 2000 votes over his gop challenger 
the committee which he headed since 1981 was one of congress 
least glamorous but most powerful the panel has jurisdiction over 
multibillion dollar highway and water projects as well as the 
airline and trucking industries 
howard was criticized for traveling and being entertained on the 
expense accounts of groups seeking his influence he was also one 
of the largest recipients in the house of businessrelated campaign 
contributions

british journalist alec colletts fate 
was still a mystery friday the third anniversary of his kidnapping 
in beirut by terrorists who have claimed they killed him in 1986 
collett worked for the united nations relief and works agency 
or unwra which marked the third year of his abduction with an 
appeal for his release 
we call on those who unjustifiably kidnapped the innocent alec 
collett to let him return to his family immediately said per 
olof hallqvist unrwas director in lebanon ignoring the report of 
his death 
collett 66 a new yorkbased journalist was abducted march 25 
1985 while on a writing assignment for the un agency 
the revolutionary organization of socialist moslems said its 
members kidnapped collett it demanded the release of three arab 
guerrillas jailed in britain in connection with the june 1982 
attempt to kill shlomo argov israels ambassador to london 
the group claimed it hanged collett on april 23 1986 to avenge 
british support of us air raids on libya some of the american 
fighterbombers that attacked tripoli and benghazi on april 15 
1986 flew from bases in britain 
president reagan ordered the raids accusing libyan leader col 
moammar ghadafi of supporting international terrorism 
after announcing collett had been killed the organization 
released a video tape purporting to show colletts body hanging 
from a gallows those who viewed the 4minute tape said the victim 
resembled unwra photographs of collett 
but colletts colleages said they could not be certain the 
hanged man was the missing journalist 
twentytwo foreigners including collett are still listed as 
missing after being kidnapped in lebanon among them are nine 
americans 
terry anderson 40 chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press has been held the longest he was kidnapped in 
west beirut on march 16 1985 
at the united nations in new york on friday officials and 
journalists marked the anniversary of colletts abduction with a 
vigil 
it pains me deeply to acknowledge that another year has 
passed said un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar 
despite my frustration at the complete lack of information we 
continue to pursue every outlet of information 
colletts wife elaine told the group at the un 
correspondents association club the call i received three years 
ago remains a nightmare today 
i want to know the whereabouts of my husband the reality is 
harsh and despite rumors circulating that he is alive which 
confirms my gut reaction there are no assurances to verify them 
roy murphy president of the foreign press association said in 
a statement addressed to the kidnappers alec collett is not an 
oppressor he was working on behalf of the dispossessed and 
homeless when he was taken 
claiming to execute alec collett in retaliation for the us 
bombing of libya is pointless he is a british citizen working for 
an international agency 
if alec collett is alive you can gain sympathy and goodwill 
for your cause by releasing him now the statement said if he 
is dead you can still gain by revealing where he is buried by 
staying silent you gain nothing but the revulsion and contempt of 
all

four applications to build a bullet 
train linking miami orlando and tampa were submitted friday 
bringing florida a step closer to a spageage highspeed passenger 
rail system between its top tourist spots 
the applications are to be revealed monday by gov bob martinez 
and legislative leaders 
after a years review the states high speed rail commission 
expects to narrow the list to three semifinalists and award the 
franchise in 1991 planners hope to have the trains running by 
1995 floridas 150th birthday 
this is a major milestone in this project said diana hull 
commission spokeswoman todays deadline will put us one large 
step along toward putting highspeed rail in florida 
the 300mile multibilliondollar project will link miami with 
tampa on the gulf coast and orlando in central florida but the 
applicants will determine precise routes financing agreements and 
which technology to use 
the train which is still being developed is expected to travel 
at average speed of 250 mph 
amtrak provides passenger service between miami and the orlando 
area about 250 miles apart but there is no rail service 
connecting tampa to either city tampa is about 85 miles from 
orlando 
the team that wins the franchise will be allowed to develop 
property for rail stations and connecting attractions a financing 
plan that mirrors one used by industrialist henry flagler when he 
built a rail line nearly 100 years ago down floridas atlantic 
coast and eventually to key west 
in theory the plan will allow the franchise holder to recoup 
its 2 billion to 5 billion in startup costs while fares will 
support operation and maintenance the idea has been in the 
planning for six years 
the comission will balance financial arrangements environmental 
concerns growth patterns and technologies select the best overall 
plan or reject all of them and make a recommendation to the 
governor and cabinet

legislation white authorities usually apply to black organizations 
the move followed a cabinet ministers statement that the extremist 
white group should stop intimidatory actions 
the afrikaner resistance movement whose members wear 
swastikalike emblems and carry guns at public appearances said it 
had expected 4000 supporters at a stadium in randfontein about 20 
miles west of johannesburg hundreds of members packed the town 
hall in nearby krugersdrop 
eugene terreblanche the groups leader condemned president 
pw bothas government for subjecting his group to the same 
restrictions applied to black antiapartheid groups 
he said the afrikaner resistance was being treated like the 
outlawed african national congress the black guerrilla movement 
seeking to end rule by south africas white minority 
under the state of emergency in effect since june 12 1986 
outdoor rallies are illegal unless approved by a magistrate or by 
adriaan vlok the law and order minister 
the government has been criticized for restricting black 
gatherings even funerals or meetings in churches while allowing 
terreblanches group to hold rallies for racial division and armed 
resistance to any political power for blacks 
bothas national party has tried to discredit the conservative 
party the main opposition by emphasizing its links with the 
afrikaner resistance but white voters chose conservatives in two 
parliamentary byelections march 2 and are expected to do so in 
another at randfontein next week

the fire will be announced at the appropriate time by the national 
transportation safety board said the spokeswoman debbie

hospitals for smoke inhalation 
ms marciniak said the burned car was inspected march 1 by a 
private fire investigator and by representatives of the federal 
railroad administration the ntsb the nebraska fire marshals 
office amtrak and one of its unions 
preliminary reports show the fire originated in wiring in the 
wall behind a heater in the luggage compartment of the crew car 
she said 
rubber insulation became separated from the wiring because of 
extensive tightening of the plastic straps that were used to bundle 
the wires overheating was caused by the reduced insulation ms 
marciniak said 
the plastic straps began to melt due to the extreme heat 
dripping burning globs of plastic on the wooden floor causing the 
floor to catch fire then the flames proceeded into the body of the 
car 
ms marciniak said amtrak already has taken steps to prevent a 
recurrence 
weve disconnected powersource wiring on cars of this type 
she said we are adding a stainless steel plating to the floors

britains cabinet officer for northern ireland 
said friday he is exploring a new political structure for the 
province in an effort to bring peace possibly based on power 
sharing between protestants and catholics 
tom king the northern ireland secretary gave no details but 
said he would discuss the prospects tuesday with the moderate 
social democratic and labor party which represents most of 
northern irelands roman catholic minority 
there was no immediate reaction previous attempts at sectarian 
power sharing have collapsed under opposition from protestants 
britain governs northern ireland directly from london 
protestant political leaders oppose any weakening of british 
control over the provinces affairs 
king spoke with reporters after hours of talks with foreign 
minister brian lenihan of the irish republic that focused on 
increasing security cooperation against a common threat the 
outlawed irish republican army 
a joint statement said both governments condemned the increase 
of violence northern ireland and urged both protestants and 
catholics to repudiate those responsible 
they appealed to both communities to repudiate those in their 
midst who sought to promote the spiral of violence and to do all in 
their power to bring this violence to an end said the statement 
issued by the northern ireland office 
the talks in a heavily guarded london office marked the first 
full britishirish government meeting since oct 21 king said 
twelve people including two british soldiers have been killed 
since march 6 when british commandos shot dead three unarmed ira 
guerrillas who allegedly were on a bombing mission in gibraltar at 
the guerrillas march 16 burial a protestant gunman killed three 
people and wounded 68 at belfast cemetery 
the meeting was called under the britishirish agreement of 
november 1985 which gave the government of the overwhelmingly 
catholic irish republic a consultative say in the running of 
protestantdominated northern ireland 
the ministers agreed to hold further meetings after easter to 
include social and economic issues 
among the issues discussed friday was britains decision to 
abandon a shortlived policy of not attending ira funerals 
following the killing of two british soldiers who drove into an ira 
cortege in catholic west belfast on march 19 
moderate catholic leaders including bishops had advocated the 
policy in the hope of avoiding clashes between police and mourners 
the soldiers were mobbed beaten stripped and then shot when they 
drove into the funeral of one of the milltown victims an ira man 
the irish delegation stressed the continuing importance of 
ensuring that these and other public occasions should be organized 
in a sensitive manner the statement said 
belfast police said in a statement friday that two men will 
appear in belfast magistrates court on saturday to be formally 
arraigned on charges of murdering the two british soldiers at an 
ira funeral in west belfast on march 19 police did not name the 
two accused men 
a private family funeral was held friday in the central england 
county of bedfordshire for one of the slain soldiers cpl david 
howes his colleague cpl derek wood was buried thursday with 
full military honors 
the violence erupted at an already low point in britishirish 
relations chilled by a series of incidents beginning in january 
when britain announced it would not prosecute northern ireland 
policemen for an alleged shoottokill policy operated by the 
mainly protestant police force in 1982

a policeman who shot to death a teenager 
carrying what turned out to be a pellet pistol was acquitted friday 
of involuntary manslaughter 
this reassures me how fair the criminal justice system is 
said patrolman john dolan jr 40 the 19year veteran was charged 
in the death of 16yearold marcus norris who was felled by a 
shotgun blast dec 31 
dolan said he shot norris because the teenager pointed a pistol 
at him that appeared to be real authorities said norris had a 
pellet pistol a nonlethal gun that uses air pressure to fire 
small projectiles 
norris had been target shooting at cans shortly before he was 
killed authorities said 
norris death led city council to pass an ordinance banning the 
sale of toys that look like firearms the shooting had also sparked 
complaints that police are overly rough with blacks norris was 
black dolan is white 
the jury of four blacks and eight whites deliberated for eight 
hours over two days 
james turner the teenagers godfather said of the acquittal 
here there is no justice 
norris was killed at a motel his mother manages after dolan was 
summoned to check out a report of a man brandishing a pistol 
norris mother faye black testified along with a family friend 
that her son had dropped the gun and raised his hands in surrender 
before he was shot but a passerby told the court the teenager 
pointed the pistol at dolan 
it was a tragedy dolan said i would give anything if it 
hadnt happened but it was totally beyond my control 
dolans defense was financed by the memphis police association 
and a halfdozen or more offduty officers in uniform attended his 
trial each day 
ray maples president of the police association said dolan 
acted properly anytime somebody points a gun at you after hes 
been told to drop it and does not your life is in danger he 
said 
dolan who has been assigned to desk work since the shooting 
said he looks forward to returning to patrol 
i hope a situation like this never develops again but on an 
armed robberytype call i will do what ive been trained to do

aboard the uss samuel b roberts in the persian gulf ap the 
cherished traditions of seamen sailing wooden ships with a star 
to steer her by are living in close quarters with technicolor 
technology aboard the navys most modern warships 
the interplay is constant between past and present aboard 
vessels such as this 445foot frigate patrolling near the strait of 
hormus as part of the us mission to protect merchant vessels in 
the persian gulf 
the sounds and practices of yesterday merge imperceptibly with 
those of today as the warship monitors the activities of iranian 
naval vessels and passes combatants of allied nations on station 
near abu musa island a staging point for iranian speed boat 
attacks against international shipping 
nostalgia has nothing to do with it binoculars barometers and 
paper navigation charts every bit as much as the radar screen and 
computer play a critical role in keeping this 400 million guided 
missile warship and her 202member crew on the warriors edge 
ready to fight with a handful of captains commands 
no matter what the crisis the familiar clang of the ships 
polished brass bell sets the rhythm of the day calmly parceling 
out the hours of day and night in halfhour increments eight bells 
struck every four hours still marks the change of watch even though 
the sound is now passed via ship intercom 
the shrill whistle of the boatswains pipe echoes as well 
alerting the crew to an announcement of importance much as the pipe 
once orchestrated the actions of yeomen high in the yardarms on 
clippers rounding the horn 
technology has its place to be sure often hidden deep within 
the ship where millions of dollars in sophisticated gear work 
around the clock one deck beneath the bridge where lookouts 
strain to spot contacts with binoculars and young mates polish 
brass each morning the amber blue and green displays of a 
computerized combat information center flicker and glow the 
command center geared to fight the ship into the 21st century 
links the ship with eyeinthe sky surveillance aircraft that 
track every ship and plane for hundreds of miles 
but ships like these plowing through the best and worst nature 
has to offer hold on to what they know best chary to relinquish 
what has worked for generations 
says senior chief petty officer george jack frost the 
senior enlisted man who has been in the navy for 20 of his 37 
years i dont think you can ever replace the seamans eye no 
matter how much technology you have instinct is still a mans best 
defense 
the systems that are up today in the 20th century computer 
slang could be down tomorrow satnav satellite navigation 
could be off a few crucial miles if the earth orbit has 
deteriorated 
i always tell my men that stars and planets never go down 
observes the roberts skipper cmdr paul x rinew a 
detailoriented leader who prides himself on being ready for 
anything venus is always there 
you can walk out on the bridgeway at night and its like times 
square says the 40yearold skipper a native of the bronx 
borough of new york city celestial navigation was good enough to 
get them explorers across the atlantic its good enough for us 
on this humid hazy day the ship frequently spurns radio 
communications to use a 1000watt 12inch signal lamp to blink out 
messages in morse code a method in use since before the titanic 
administrative messages greetings to captain words of praise 
all are blinked from one us ship to another to keep secure radio 
channels open for more important communications 
i take pride in my rating no doubt about that explains 
petty officer charles dumas 30 of newport ri a signalmen 
first class planning to reenlist at sea next week after years in 
the navy its a good life a signalmans life 
signalmen often exchange pleasantries of their own between 
official messages its great to talk to other countrys ships to 
find out whats going on says first class petty officer serge 
kingery 40 its the only place on the ship to be afforded that 
opportunity we can talk no matter what nation it is 
signal flags of yore are flung as well just as they did in 
john paul jones time each multicolored flag spells a letter for 
messages with certain single letter flags signals specific ships 
actions 
boatswain mates similarly carry forward the traditions of 
forefathers on fore decks deck lines are wrapped and stowed neatly 
within several feet of the missile launcher capable of remotely 
firing harpoon antiship and standard antiaircraft missilers at a 
moments notice 
like the men before them the bosuns mates scrub chip paint 
handle the ships small boats and use a monkey fist on a light 
line to cast a rope over to an adjacent vessel to begin an underway 
replenishment the leadcentered woven rope ball has been used 
almost as long as men have been at sea the rating today attracts 
much the same type of sailors it did before 
i like working outside says jim owens 24 a bosuns mate 
third class from newport ri 
now as then the mates with idle time stage practical jokes on 
newcomers to the sammy b as she is affectionately known a 
favorite ordering a rookie on board to the rail to keep an eye out 
for the mail buoy a fictitious navigational buoy where 
vessels supposedly pick up their mail bag 
sure we keep em up there for a while say owens course 
a year later hes doing the same to someone else 
and for anyone thinking the tatoo has gone out of fashion in 
this mans navy just ask frost 37 of kingstown ri 
i would never let anyone put anything on me when i was 
drunk he says i would at least want to know what was going 
on 
a star adorns his left hand his wifes name dawn wreathes his 
wrist beneath his watch strap the phrase american navy in 
chinese characters adorns his shoulder along with his outdated 
service identification number all needled in to his ruddy 
freckled skin at pinkies a notorious tatoo parlor in hong kong 
the ship intercom announces the smoking lamp is lit which 
allows smoking by sailors who in previous generations used a 
constantly lit smoking lamp to light cigarettes on windswept 
ships 
and the dog watch now as then remains the watch that rotates 
the starting hour for work details forward by several hours a week 
the phrase traces its origins either to the watch during the dog 
hours of early morning or dodging the watch 
like so much in the navy the language and practices of 
yesterday blend with the demands of today assuring that todays

the aging of the babyboom generation is 
creating a couchpotato economy that will be marked by low 
unemployment more savings and rising productivity economists and 
population experts say 
the dawning of a couchpotato economy is the best thing that 
could happen to the united states after years of yuppie splurging 
says edward yardeni the economist who coined the term 
yuppies are slowing down were all getting older a little 
less frivolous yardeni 38 director of economics and 
fixedincome research for prudentialbache securities inc said 
this past week 
exhibit no 1 in yardenis case is the shift noted last year in 
consumerspending priorities after the gogo years of 1985 and 1986 
in 1985 the two fastestgrowing segments were brokerage and 
investment fees and audio and video equipment 
in 1986 the leaders were boats and recreational vehicles 
in 1987 america seemed to turn suddenly sedentary books and 
maps finished first followed closely by funeral and burial 
expenses 
the numbers from the commerce department may be misleading 
because the biggest percentage risers are small segments that 
fluctuate widely but yardeni is convinced that they tell a story 
im not promising you that the transformation definitely 
happened in 87 but something is afoot yardeni said 
he said the shift could point to an increased savings rate 
and that should leave room for a boom in exports and a boom in 
capital spending which is not a bad mix at all 
one reason for japans extraordinary success is its high savings 
rate which creates a pool of money for investment 
trailing behind the american baby boomers is the babybust 
generation the smaller complement of workers that is entering the 
work force now 
there are too few qualified baby busters to fill all the 
entrylevel jobs but yardeni optimistically sees a positive side 
to that it will force business to find ways to automate more he 
says increasing the nations productivity 
yardenis ideas are supported by others including cheryl 
russell editorinchief of american demographics magazine in 
ithaca ny 
as baby boomers settle down they are beginning to put aside 
money for their childrens education and their own retirement ms 
russell said 
but baby boomers will still be spending too something that is 
good news for producers of consumer goods 
baby boomers are entering their peak earnings years so they 
will be able to spend more and save more at the same time ms 
russell said 
in spite of the freespending reputation of the young ms 
russell said households headed by people aged 35 and over lead 
their juniors in every broad category of spending except two 
alcohol and rented dwellings 
the mix of spending is what is changing couch potatoes spend 
less money on movie tickets more on things like vcrs and of 
course couches 
the changing habits of the nation are more than a myth the 
roper organization last year reported a poll finding that more than 
half of people over 30 prefer doing things at home while more than 
half of people under 30 prefer doing things outside the home 
the median age in the united states is rising ms russell 
notes and it has just passed 30 
everyones tired said thomas miller 30 editor of the 
public pulse a roper newsletter some peole call it the 
cocooning phenomenon some people call it the couchpotato economy 
we think its mainly exhaustion

wall street analysts are expecting new signals 
in the next few days of a healthy outlook for the economy 
theyre not so sure however whether the figures will be enough 
to prop up the stock market after its sharp selloff of late 
when the government reports tuesday on the index of leading 
economic indicators for february economists at shearson lehman 
hutton inc expect it to show an increase of 09 percent another 
major brokerage firm merrill lynch is looking for a 10 percent 
rise 
anything in that range would be the best showing for the index 
which is designed to measure forces influencing the future course 
of the economy since last summer well before the market crash 
among the 12 components of the index shearson says building 
permits are likely to make a strong contribution rebounding from 
an abnormally low level in january 
another indicator already known to be upbeat is the stock market 
itself which turned in a good showing last month 
for a while at midwinter worries mounted that the index was 
foreshadowing a recession with three consecutive monthly declines 
that caution light stopped flashing however when the decline 
originally reported for december was revised to show a small gain 
now if the february figure lives up to its advance billing 
fears of an impending business slump will presumably continue to 
fade yet wall street with its traditional perversity may not 
find the news reassuring 
as the merrill lynch market letter observes in its current 
issue a faster pace for the economy could be a doubleedged 
sword for the market 
it would support our projections that corporate profits 
based on standard amp poors industrial index will climb about 17 
percent this year but it would also fuel fears about increases in 
interest rates 
that same reasoning applies to the report on the employment 
situation for march which is scheduled to be issued by the labor 
department on april 1 when the markets will be closed in 
observance of good friday 
the february figures which showed a much largerthanexpected 
increase of 531000 in nonfarm payroll employment came as a blow 
to the bond market by quashing hopes that the federal reserve might 
ease credit further 
shearson analysts figure that pace is unsustainable and are 
projecting a somewhat weak payroll employment gain of 150000 
for this month still past experience has shown that these data 
can spring some big surprises 
while nearterm recession fears were supposedly ebbing in the 
past week so were stock prices the dow jones average of 30 
industrials dropped 10842 points to 197895 for its worst weekly 
showing so far in 1988 
the new york stock exchange composite index fell 607 to 14658 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 904 to 
37254 and the american stock exchange market value index 447 to 
29464 
volume on the big board averaged 15726 million shares a day 
against 17526 million the week before 
as bizarre as investors responses to positive economic news 
might seem there is a logical thread that runs through them 
especially when you consider that the markets biggest concern is 
not the known present but the unknown future 
most economists agree that employment figures are a 
coincident indicator in other words a rise in employment now 
is no reliable indication of better business conditions later on 
the leading indicators similarly are old news for the market 
in the sense that they partly reflect what stock prices themselves 
were doing several weeks ago 
the chief concern about economic strength is that it may be 
setting the stage for a tighter credit policy increasing 
inflationary pressures and other forces that might bring on a 
recession six months or even a year from now

gillette co stock was up in heavy trading for the 
third consecutive day friday amid speculation that yet another 
suitor was mulling an attempt to takeover the consumer products 
firm 
stock of gillette already the subject of a hostile takeover bid 
by coniston partners was up 2 to 46 
meanwhile the new york stock exchange took a sharp drop for the 
second straight session in its worst week so far in 1988 the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials closed at 197895 down 4492 
points from thursday and 10842 points for the week 
a gillette spokesman would not comment on the rumors nor would 
a spokesman for philip morris cos rumored on wall street to be 
planning to pay 60 a share for gillette in an acquisition philip 
morris shares fell 3 to 88 
reese stone spokesman for philip morris cos inc said he had 
not heard any conversations concerning his company and gillette 
i dont know anything about it but our policy is we dont 
comment on acquisition rumors he said 
gillette spokesman dave fausch said we dont comment on 
rumors asked to explain why gillette stock was up friday on a 
generally bearish market he said we also have no comment on 
stock market activities 
allan kaplan a tobacco and beverage analyst for merrill lynch 
in new york said he had heard the rumors but doubted their 
validity 
philip morris management has been saying all along that they 
arent in the market for a large acquisition he said they 
just announced a small one but this would cost them 7 billion if 
they paid 60 a share for it and im not sure they are willing to 
make another acquisition until they get general foods going 
philip morris acquired general foods in november 1985 he said 
all you hear is rumors said marc cohenm a sandford 
bernstein analyst who follows philip morris its all over the 
place but i have no way of knowing if there are any transactions 
taking place 
coniston a new york investment firm which controls about 6 
percent of gillettes stock announced last month it was 
approaching potential buyers of the bostonbased company and might 
take other moves to boost gillettes share price 
last month coniston nominated four candidates for the seats 
available on the 12member board of directors at gillettes annual 
meeting april 21 
gillette chairman colman m mockler jr responded by asking 
stockholders not to sign proxy cards being distributed by coniston 
soliciting support in the elections 
earlier this month new york real estate developer donald trump 
was granted a federal trade commission waiver of the standard 
waiting period for acquiring large blocks of stock and was allowed 
to purchase up to 249 percent of gillette stock 
trump owns about 400000 shares which was less than 
threetenths of 1 percent of gillettes 115 million common shares 
outstanding 
gillette underwent a major restructuring after rebuffing a third 
hostile takeover bid by revlon in 1986 which agreed not to seek to 
gain control of gillette under a 10year pact signed in november 
1986 
john c maxwell an analyst with wheat first securities of 
richmond va said the rumored takeover of gillette by philip 
morris has been around for days and added that it makes no sense 
its another cash cow its in the razor blade business 
thats not exactly a growth industry said maxwell who follows 
philip morris 
i cant pronounce the name but theres also rumors that a 
japanese pharmaceutical company is interested 
maxwell said the flurry of rumors riddling the market is a sign 
of another fall they pushed up all these stocks the last time on 
disingenuous rumors they just pumped all these stocks and then the 
market fell 500 points

ge meanwhile said it would move its federal court action in

witnesses are in michigan

augusta gabased appliance and lawn equipment maker after roper 
boards ecommended that shareholders accept the 50ashare bid 
from whirlpool 
whirlpool has not said whether it will respond with another 
increase we dont have a comment on that at this point

analysts said merging with roper would move whirlpool ahead of 
ge as the nations top appliance maker 
whirlpools federal court suit charged that ges initial offer 
for roper was an attempt to sabotage a whirlpoolroper merger 
agreement announced in february in which whirlpool said it would 
pay 3750 a share 
in its lawsuits ge claimed whirlpool and roper failed to 
adequately disclose terms of their merger agreement under
