mayor tommy hazouri at the controls 
of a crane wielding a wrecking ball officially marked the end of 
36 years of toll bridges in jacksonville by helping demolish 
several toll booths 
after collecting some 370 million in tolls from 15 billion 
motorists the tolls were removed friday from four local bridges 
and a fourlane expressway 
we have taken a quantum leap forward in improving the quality 
of life for our city today is like new years christmas and the 
fourth of july rolled into one hazouri said at ceremonies at the 
mathews bridge which opened in 1953 
moments earlier signs were unveiled on the mathews bridge toll 
plazas reading no tolls pass thru 
at the same time the tolls also ended on the fuller warren 
trout river and hart bridges and on butler boulevard a fourlane 
expressway linking interstate 95 to the beach 
there was a festive party atmosphere on the mathews bridge with 
crowds cheering horns honking and the st johns river city band 
playing fireworks were ignited on quarantine island in the middle 
of the st johns river 
the mayor and chester stokes chairman of the jacksonville 
transportation authority climbed aboard a large yellow crane and 
with the help of a crane operator toppled several toll booths 
in a large frontpage headline the florida timesunion 
proclaimed friday untolled joy keep the change 
the removal of the tolls was made possible by the passage in 
march 1988 of a halfcent city sales tax in addition to removing 
tolls on existing bridges the new dames point bridge opened 
tollfree earlier this year 
the removal of the tolls cames 18 months after the voters 
approved the concept the wait was necessary to convince state 
officials that the sales tax revenue would generate sufficient 
funds to cover the refinancing of 200 million in outstanding 
tollrevenue bonds issued in 1963 1977 and 1985

the 13th day of jury deliberations in the 
night stalker trial was interrupted friday when the judge 
dismissed a juror for sleeping and ordered the panel to start all 
over again 
an alternate juror was chosen to replace the sleeping juror in 
the complex case involving 13 murders and 30 felonies committed 
during the summer of l985 jurors heard six months of testimony 
after six months of jury selection 
richard ramirez a 29yearold drifter from el paso texas is 
accused of being the devilworshipping night stalker who raped 
murdered and robbed victims in a rampage that terrified southern 
california 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin said he and defense 
lawyer ray clark were summoned friday to the courtroom of superior 
court judge michael tynan after the jury foreman sent a note saying 
that one juror had been seen sleeping at the deliberation table 
tynan interviewed the foreman who said two other jurors had 
reported seeing the man in question nodding off and snoring in the 
deliberation room 
after a brief discussion with attorneys tynan summoned the 
juror and told him he was being dismissed for sleeping the juror 
did not protest 
the judge then brought the entire panel into the courtroom he 
told them not to speculate on why the juror was being dismissed and 
instructed them to begin their talks anew with the alternate 
filling the dismissed jurors place 
halpin said it was impossible to tell how long it would take now 
for the jury to reach a unanimous decision on the 43 counts 
involved 
earlier this week the jury returned to the courtroom to ask for 
a repeat of testimony involving ramirez dental problems it was 
the first time they had asked for testimony to be read back since 
they began deliberating july 26

the white house sifting through offers hints 
and statements from the middle east about american hostages in 
lebanon says the united states wants to let these issues play 
out for a few days and see what happens 
we get a lot of different statements some optimistic some 
pessimistic some critical some crazy said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
we watch them all analyze them all and in a sense the public 
and the press all are seeing the process pretty much as it is 
the latest development was a conditional offer of assistance 
from the spiritual leader of the proiranian group hezbollah 
believed to be the umbrella for shiite moslem factions holding most 
of the 16 western hostages in lebanon 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah during a friday prayer service 
in beirut said he was ready to help free the hostages if the west 
helps release arab prisoners in israel 
fitzwater and state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
using identical language at separate briefings called it an 
interesting statement 
they should release the hostages ms tutwiler said you 
dont need to talk about it just release the people who are held 
against their will by hezbollah any help which any party can 
provide in the unconditional safe and immediate release of the 
hostages is welcome 
fitzwater said the administration has not had any direct contact 
with hezbollah and isnt seeking any ms tutwiler reiterated the 
administration position that it was willing to talk with anyone 
elaborating on his answer fitzwater said we always said wed 
talk to anybody and seek any avenue for getting the release of the 
hostages but theres never really been an opportunity for direct 
discussions with the hostage holders 
partly they havent wanted to weve said we wont negotiate 
for hostages it just hasnt been fruitful 
an administration official speaking on condition of anonymity 
expressed skepticism about fadlallahs offer 
this is the kind of thing weve seen him say on frequent 
occasions and hes never done anything the official said 
fitzwater describing that state of play after two weeks of 
intense activity said its a long process and we need to be 
patient and let discussions flow back and forth 
he said president bush has a sense of urgency on the overall 
situation but the most important traits right now are patience and 
determination to not let urgency push you to say things or do 
things that would be counterproductive 
insisting there were no new developments fitzwater said we 
would like to lower our voices a little and let these issues play 
out for a few days and see what happens 
fitzwater also played down the prospect of direct us contacts 
with iran after saying a day earlier that the administration 
expected there would eventually be talks with tehran on the 
hostages and communications through third parties 
the whole question of direct contacts has gotten so far out of 
proportion that i dont want to lend any credence to it he said 
we are having any number of contacts through any number of 
channels but this directcontacts business im afraid has 
gotten you off track in terms of focusing on whats really 
happening there fitzwater said 
theres no miracle there in direct talks with iran its not 
that big a deal theres all kinds of contacts that can and will be 
made that have to be made preparatory to direct talks and 
there need never be direct contacts to solve many of these issues 
to change relationships and so forth 
meanwhile the new york times reported today that soviet and 
us officials said moscow had sent messages to iran syria and 
palestinian groups urgently appealing for release of the western 
hostages 
the soviet response has been constructive helpful and 
forthcoming the newspaper quoted an administration official 
its less than we would like them to do but more than they would 
have done in the past

the justice department is hardening its 
assessment of the damage done by public disclosure to its 
investigation of suspected soviet spy felix s bloch 
justice department spokesman david runkel said flatly friday 
that the july 21 disclosure that the 54yearold us diplomat was 
under investigation had compromised the investigation 
there is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case 
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation 
did compromise the investigation runkel said 
he didnt explain how the investigation had been compromised 
however runkels assessment was much stronger than one he 
delivered july 31 when asked about the impact of unprecedented 
publicity on an espionage investigation that so far has produced no 
criminal charges 
he said then that the premature disclosure may have had an 
adverse impact on the development of new evidence in the case 
the investigation of bloch the no 2 us diplomat in vienna 
for much of the decade was disclosed july 21 by abc news 
the differences in the statements reflects a different view 
based on how people in the department see the situation today 
runkel said friday when asked about the contrast between his two 
assessments 
he acknowledged the justice department opposed the state 
departments decision to issue a statement after the abc news 
broadcast that essentially confirmed the accuracy of the report 
the television report and a series of disclosures have produced 
what runkel called the circus going on out there of reporters 
and fbi agents tailing bloch each day on daily excursions from his 
apartment 
on thursday runkel acknowledged the department doesnt have an 
espionage case against bloch who was placed on paid leave by the 
state department 
asked why there were no charges despite continuous fbi 
surveillance of bloch runkel said the department does not bring 
charges unless it believes it has sufficient evidence to convince a 
jury beyond a reasonable doubt that a person is guilty of violating 
the law 
the fbi has been conducting a roundtheclock surveillance of 
bloch to prevent him from leaving the country while investigators 
try to find evidence to charge him with espionage 
runkel refused to comment when asked if the department had 
evidence that it was unwilling to disclose in court for fear of 
hurting counterintelligence operations 
bloch meantime led reporters and photographers on a friday 
afternoon shopping excursion to a suburban supermarket 
about 1 pm bloch announced he was about to leave his 
apartment two hours later bloch finally emerged driving his 
lightblue mercedezbenz he invited two television crews to ride 
along while he went on errands 
followed by a 20car caravan of reporters tv crews and fbi 
agents bloch drove to a shopping center in nearby bethesda md 
where he shopped at a supermarket and a bookstore 
the supermarket manager asked the tv crews to leave the store 
after a cameraman who was backpeddling to film bloch buying 
groceries knocked over an elderly woman who cut her hand on the 
floor

a legal publication says oliver north could 
have been sentenced to more than 4 years in prison if federal 
sentencing guidelines had been applied to his irancontra 
conviction 
however the guidelines that recommend ranges of possible 
sentences to judges werent applied in the north case because they 
cover only federal crimes committed after nov 1 1987 
the editors of the federal sentencing reporter a nonprofit 
publication circulated among federal judges probation officers 
law professors and lawyers concluded north could have been 
sentenced under the guidelines to 21 to 57 months in prison 
north was convicted of aiding and abetting obstruction of 
congress destroying government documents and accepting an illegal 
gratuity while working at the white house in 1986 
he was fined put on probation and ordered to do community 
service but was sentenced to no jail time north began his 
community service work this week 
the ranges sketch possible avenues guideline sentencing might 
have taken marc miller of atlantas emory university law school 
and daniel j freed of yale university law school said in their 
analysis 
if norths had been a guidelines case us district court judge 
gerhard gesell still could have imposed no jail time but 
prosecutors would have been able to appeal 
under the guidelines there is a degree of flexibility but 
the challenge for the judge is to persuasively explain why there is 
a substantial departure miller said friday in an interview 
when the appeals courts find the explanations unpersuasive 
theyve reversed sentences 
the length of a recommended sentence under the guidelines in the 
north case would depend partly on a judge deciding whether the 
former white house aide substantially interfered with the 
administration of justice 
other factors would be the value assigned to classified 
documents that north destroyed whether he was a major or minor 
participant in the crime of aiding the obstruction of congress and 
whether he was considered to be in a highlevel decisionmaking 
capacity

the justice department saying new yorks 
shoreham nuclear power plant is safe efficient and 
muchneeded is joining in a lawsuit to prevent the plant from 
being dismantled 
the intervention in a state court came on behalf of the energy 
department which has strongly opposed the shutdown of the 
813megawatt plant on long island 
w henson moore deputy energy secretary said the state in its 
approval of the dismantling plan had not adequately considered the 
impact on the environment 
the justice department argues that the new york power authority 
and the state public service commission should have prepared formal 
environmental impact statements before approving the plan 
the plant moore said is safe efficient and muchneeded 
adding that its closure would require the region to rely more 
heavily on fossil fuel those fuels he said will have adverse 
environmental consequences through the increased release of 
chemicals that contribute to acid rain and global warming 
some long island residents and a group called scientists and 
engineers for secure energy filed the suit against the plant 
the bush administration previously has made clear its opposition 
to the closing of the 55 billion plant completed in 1985 and 
licensed last year it has yet to produce any commercial 
electricity 
state and local officials contend the plant should not be 
allowed to operate because evacuation of the area 50 miles east of 
new york city would be impossible 
new york gov mario cuomo plans to meet with president bush next 
week to discuss white house opposition to the plant being torn down

millionaire industrialist victor posner 
has decided to build five 30story condominium buildings on his 
oceanfront property after rejecting a state offer for a land swap 
the florida department of natural resources had been trying 
since march to persuade the miami beach executive to swap his 13 
acres of oceanfront property for 67 acres of stateowned land near 
the doral country club in miami 
the posner tract the citys only undeveloped oceanfront land 
is wedged between a strip of highrises and would have made a 
perfect setting for a park state officials said 
but posner thought the swap would not have been profitable for 
him said his attorney william j roberts 
the miami land formerly owned by the federal aviation 
administration is worth 8 million while posners land is worth 
15 million state officials said 
roberts said posner would proceed with plans to build the 
condominiums with 1500 units on the site posner faces one more 
hurdle state approval for two of the five buildings that would be

the government says that net deposit 
withdrawals at the nations thrifts more than doubled in june to 
46 billion 
the office of thrift supervision known as the federal home loan 
bank board until enactment of the new savings and loan law earlier 
this week attributed the outflow to intentional shrinkage by 
thrifts as they prepared to meet the laws tough capital rule 
everybody knew about the legislation in june james barth 
ots chief economist said friday they knew it was just a matter 
of time and they were doing the things they will have to do in 
order to meet higher capital requirements 
about one in four of the nations 2933 sampls dont meet the new 
standard 150 in tangible capital for every 100 in lending 
that becomes effective in four months 
the only way thrifts that cant attract new capital can comply 
is to sell off assets such as loans and pay off liabilities such as 
deposits 
barth said sampls in june reduced their assets by a nearrecord 
76 billion a monthly total exceeded only by the 8 billion 
reduction in january 
most of the june reduction was accounted for by a record 51 
billion drop in mortgagebacked securities one of the most easily 
sold assets in a thrift portfolio 
the june deposit outflow was the 14th in a row although it was 
more than twice the 21 billion drain in may it was still far 
below the 108 billion record set in january 
for the first six months of the year a net 403 billion have 
flowed out of thrift accounts compared with an inflow of 118 
billion in the first half of 1988

prosecutors want a federal appeals court to 
reconsider its decision to overturn the illegal lobbying conviction 
against former white house aide lyn nofziger 
the us circuit court of appeals panel undermined critical 
provisions of the ethics in government act when it ruled june 27 
that nofzigers conviction must be set aside prosecutors said in 
court papers filed friday 
the office of independent counsel james mckay asked the court to 
grant a rehearing before the threemember panel or set the case for 
rehearing by all 10 members of the appeals court 
nofziger was convicted feb 11 1988 on three counts of 
lobbying top presidential aides on behalf of private clients 
shortly after he left the reagan white house 
prosecutors say the lobbying violated a oneyear ethics law ban 
against lobbying former government colleagues 
but the appeals panel in a 21 ruling said that to get a 
conviction prosecutors were required to show that nofziger knew he 
was lobbying his former colleagues on matters in which the white 
house had a direct and substantial interest 
prosecutors maintain the law required only that they show 
nofziger intended to influence the officials on those matters 
one of nofzigers lawyers lawrence barcella said the 
prosecution arguments present absolutely nothing new and there 
is no reason to disturb the appeals court decision 
the lobbying nofziger performed was for the scandalplagued 
wedtech corp a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of 
the air forces a10 antitank plane 
nofziger 65 was sentenced to 90 days in prison and fined 
30000

two abortion protesters and a man who insisted 
god told him to set fire to an abortion clinic conspired to violate 
federal racketeering laws a federal court jury ruled friday in a 
civil lawsuit 
curtis beseda already serving 20 years in a texas federal 
prison for setting fire to the feminist womens health center in 
everett also violated the racketeering statute through arson and 
extortion aimed at the abortion clinic the jury concluded 
the everett clinic was burned three times between december 1983 
and april 1984 then closed its doors beseda earlier told the jury 
he had no intention of setting any fire until he heard god tell him 
to do it 
he and protesters dottie roberts and sharon codispoti both of 
lake stevens were found to have conspired to violate the 
racketeering statute 
beseda was ordered to pay 268500 in civil damages while 
beseda roberts and codispoti will share another 11000 fine all 
damages can be trebled 
two other defendants bonnie and michael undseth of snohomish 
were acquitted jurors in judge thomas zillys court deliberated 3 
days before reaching a verdict in the monthlong trial 
the lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute 
intended to fight organized crime has been used against abortion 
protesters 
damages will go to several clinic employees and to the feminist 
womens health center of yakima parent clinic to the one that 
burned 
roberts lawyer theresa schrempp promised an appeal roberts 
holding her young grandson timothy said she thinks the jury was 
confused by the complexity of the case involving 52 pages of jury 
instructions 
its a perversion of the first amendment she said this 
ones going to the supreme court she said the plaintiffs wont 
get anything out of me because i dont have anything 
in philadelphia the case that set precedent in the seattle case 
was upheld on appeal in march and defendants have asked the us 
supreme court to hear it 
twentysix individuals were found guilty of multiple acts of 
extortion at an abortion clinic there the clinic was awarded 
100000 
lawyers for the plaintiffs alleged beseda and the other 
defendants conspired to shut down the clinic by arson personal and 
telephone harassment of patients and staff blocking access to and 
from the clinic picketing and helping beseda escape to canada 
a successful action under the racketeering statute must show an 
enterprise adversely affects interstate commerce and engages in a 
pattern of racketeering meaning a serious violation of the law 
such as arson extortion wire fraud robbery kidnapping or 
murder said edmond tiryak the civil rights attorney who tried the 
philadelphia case

crash tests indicate that a driver of a 
peugeot 505s has a greater chance of head injury than drivers of 28 
other cars and small trucks tested so far federal engineers say 
however a peugeot spokesman said the tests conducted by the 
national highway traffic safety administration using 
instrumentequipped dummies dont accurately test the effects of 
real highway accidents 
our top concern is protecting human beings not dummies 
pascal henault president of peugeot motors of america said friday 
the new series of tests included 10 different car and van models 
by us and foreign automaker in previous tests involving 19 
vehicles the chevrolet astro van fared worst the astro now stands 
second among cars tested for injuries in a 35mileperhour 
collision 
the vehicles were tested under nhtsas program to provide 
consumers a guide to the safety of 1989 cars and small trucks 
the car in which the lightest injury potential was recorded so 
far is the dodge daytona followed by the ford thunderbird and the 
audi 80 the audi was among the 10 cars tested in the most recent 
round others in addition to the peugeot 505s were volkswagen 
fox hyundai sonata isuzu trooper ii suzuki sidekick and toyota 
cressida corolla pickup and van 
after the latest tests were made public peugeot issued a news 
release including comments from henault and from four automotive 
and consumer experts who criticized the government tests as 
inaccurate measures of the varied circumstances that exist in real 
crashes 
peugeots commitment to building cars that are safe in the 
real world cannot be overshadowed by these experimental crashtest 
results said henault 
the nhtsa tests consist of crashing a single model of each car 
containing two crash dummies into a fixed barrier at 35 mph the 
stresses that result on the dummies are measured by sensors the 
artificial occupants are protected by seat belts and other safety 
devices used in the cars 
nhtsa engineers reported stresses on the head as an index called 
the head injury criterion the higher the index the greater 
the likelihood of injury 
the peugeot crash produced a head injury criterion of 1983 on 
the driverside dummy the earlier astro test registered 1849 
federal regulations require cars to produce a head injury 
criterion no greater than 1000 in tests conducted by the 
automakers at 30 mph the nhtsa tests are not considered comparable 
because they are done at a speed 5 mph faster 
the tests are continuing but here is how all models so far

the food and drug administration is taking the 
first formal action against generic drug companies being 
investigated by the agency revoking recent drug approvals of two 
manufacturers 
the revocations were issued friday against par pharmaceutical 
inc of spring valley ny and american therapeutics inc of 
bohemia ny 
both actions involved chlorozoxazone the generic name for 
parafon forte a muscle relaxant made by johnson amp johnson par 
received approval to market its version june 5 and ati was granted 
approval june 23 
fda spokesman jeff nesbit said the approvals were rescinded 
because the reports on which they were based didnt include 
substantial deficiencies in manufacturing practices found 
during a recent special inspection 
the approvals were revoked aug 3 nesbit said 
both companies disputed the legal ground on which fda issued the 
revocations 
the agency just cant summarily rescind a new drug approval 
without providing sponsor due process of law said david weeda a 
lawyer for ati 
he said the manufacturing problems cited by the fda involved 
minor labeling and packaging deficiencies which the company made 
prompt corrective action 
ati had not shipped its product when the approval was rescinded 
but par had begun shipping a spokeswoman said 
its not being shipped anymore but its not being recalled 
either said par lawyer barbara manners she said fda hadnt 
raised any questions about the safety of the product 
par and ati are among 11 generic drug companies being 
investigated by the fda in the wake of allegations of fraud and 
corruption in the generic drug industry 
par recently pleaded guilty to providing an improper gratuity to 
an fda employee par also has admitted giving the fda false 
information about one of its drugs which it has recalled

the state department is taking the unusual 
step of singling out syria for its role in the latest round of 
fighting in beirut 
the criticism came friday as us officials continued to seek 
syrian help to obtain the release of eight american hostages held 
by proiranian militants in lebanon 
we again call upon syria an active participant in the 
fighting the lebanese armed forces as well as the various 
lebanese factions for an immediate ceasefire the lifting of all 
blockades and the initiation of a dialogue for the political 
reconstruction of lebanon said state department spokeswoman 
margaret tutwiler 
the state department has generally refrained from singling out 
the combatants by name preferring to call for restraint by all 
sides 
the latest round of fighting in the fivemonth artillery war 
over control of beirut came friday when syrian and christian 
gunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers killing six 
people 
us policy toward syria treads a delicate balance of criticism 
of the sovietbacked government for its support of palestinian and 
shiite terrorism and seeking to enlist its support for the 
arabisraeli peace process and other negotiations in the volatile 
region

the energy department says investigators found 
no evidence that an uncontrolled nuclear chain reaction occurred at 
the rocky flats weapons plant near denver 
however the department said friday that plutonium was found in 
situations that require immediate attention the doe did not 
detail those situations or what would be done about them 
plutonium is the nuclear material recovered from weapons being 
retired and reprocessed at rocky flats to make triggers for new 
weapons it is highly toxic 
the question of a chain reaction arose after radioactive 
isotopes of strontium and cesium which dont occur in nature were 
found in groundwater near the plant some plant employees claimed 
that conditions existed routinely that could lead to a chain 
reaction 
an uncontrolled chain reaction produces an explosion in a bomb 
and a controlled reaction is the basis for nuclear power plants 
officials from the environmental protection agency and state 
agencies said the strontium and cesium radioactivity was so low 
that it was almost undetectable and might have been the result of 
fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests of the 1950s and 1960s 
rocky flats has been criticized for polluting the environment 
and the fbi has begun an investigation of past practices

tens of thousands of poles stopped work for an 
hour in a solidarityorganized strike while the soviet ambassador 
met with communist leaders and officials in moscow spoke against 
upheaval in poland 
it was the first soviet government comment on the parliamentary 
maneuvering in which solidarity is trying to form a noncommunist 
government to lead the soviet unions largest east bloc ally 
the independent solidarity trade union movement staged the 
strike in gdansk province to demand more pay and an end to 
communist party influence on management 
soviet ambassador vladimir brovikov held an unusual series of 
meetings in warsaw on friday including sessions with the chairmen 
of the united peasant party and the democratic party the parties 
traditionally have been allied with the communists but solidarity 
is courting them to form a government 
according to the polish governments pap news agency the party 
leaders and the soviet ambassador met to discuss starting direct 
cooperation with the soviet communist party and to review reforms 
in both countries 
pap said brovikov met also with prime minister gen czeslaw 
kiszczak who is trying to assemble a communistdominated cabinet 
since neither solidarity nor the communists have a majority in 
parliament support from the peasants and democrats is crucial for 
both sides efforts to form a government 
a soviet official in moscow quoted by the official tass news 
agency hinted that solidaritys attempts to shut the communists 
out of a coalition government could hurt stability in europe 
the unidentified official did not mention solidarity by name but 
criticized attempts to use the process of forming the polish 
government for destabilizing the situation in the country 
vadim perfiliev soviet foreign ministry first deputy was 
quoted as telling a news conference that any acts that threaten 
polands treaty obligations including those under the warsaw 
treaty and on sovietpolish cooperation would not promote the 
interests of stability in europe 
forming a new government was polands affair perfiliev said 
but added that the hoped a balanced approach would prevail 
according to tass 
the general strike in gdansk province by bus drivers 
shipbuilders dockhands and factory workers was solidaritys first 
since regaining legal status in april bogdan borusewicz an 
organizer described it as exceptionally successful 
solidarity said more than 200000 workers participated and many 
signed up to join the union which has grown slowly since 
legalization 
even those enterprises where solidarity is weak went on 
strike borusewicz said 
solidaritys regional council for gdansk province estimated more 
than 90 percent of the 500 enterprises in which it had members took 
part in the strike 
organizers said it encompassed gdansk sopot and gdynia along 
the baltic coast and inland towns the province has 15 million 
people 
solidarity leader lech walesa addressing workers in gdynia 
referred to parliaments election of kiszczak as prime minister 
aug 2 and said lets not allow the monopoly of generals to be 
reborn 
the opposition newspaper gazeta wyborcza said reports were 
circulating that the opposition was proposing walesa for prime 
minister barbara madajczykkrasowska a solidarity spokeswoman 
said walesa made no comment on that report friday 
the strike announced by wailing sirens and whistles at noon 
idled the northern and repair shipyards in gdansk the paris 
commune shipyard in gdynia and all ports in both cities solidarity 
said 
buses and streetcars stopped running and factories displayed 
banners to show they were participating 
solidaritys birthplace the lenin shipyard supported the 
demands but did not strike workers said they did not want to risk 
upsetting a tentative deal under which american philanthropist 
barbara piaseckajohnson would invest in the stateowned yard to 
save it from bankruptcy 
the official trade union federation opzz said its unions 
approved of solidaritys economic demands and it supported the 
protest

politics in this workingclass city have 
never been pretty and it is not surprising this summers threeway 
mayoral race has turned downright ugly 
mayor james griffin has been called a sixpack politician 
state assemblyman william hoyt was dubbed a silkstocking 
liberal and former chief city judge wilbur trammell cannot 
shake the tag of being a spoiler 
when the candidates arent calling each other names they have 
some choice words for the reporters who cover them griffin said 
monday that 90 percent of the citys journalists were dishonest and 
he advised them all to mind their own business 
things began to turn nasty last week when trammell confirmed he 
was circulating petitions to qualify himself for an independent 
line in the nov 7 general election the move was interpreted to 
mean that even if he lost the sept 11 democratic primary he would 
stay in the race 
nobody controls me trammell said 
aides to hoyt who has the democratic partys endorsement 
blasted trammell for being a spoiler 
griffin a registered democrat running with the republican party 
endorsement for his fourth fouryear term as mayor has benefited 
in past campaigns from having the democratic vote split among two 
or more challengers polls indicate the same thing may happen this 
year 
in an emotional rebuttal of allegations that he was in the race 
to help keep griffin in office trammell said no sixpack mayor 
or silkstocking liberal is going to defeat me no matter what 
they try 
during a major snow storm that hit buffalo in 1985 griffin 
advised residents to stay in their homes and relax with a sixpack 
of beer 
in addition trammell charged that hoyt is in bed with jimmy 
griffin a bigot from day one griffin and hoyt are white 
trammell is black 
hoyt in turn claims that trammell has zero chance of 
winning the primary and should get out of the race if trammell 
quit hoyt said his polls show that he would have enough support to 
beat griffin in a headtohead matchup either in the primary or the 
general election 
griffin ridiculed hoyt for having paid 50000 to a pollster 
just to tell him hes losing added the mayor at a news 
conference i could have told him that 
the mayor brushed aside reports that except for his monthly news 
conference he has avoided both his opponents and the media 
the mayor said that if reporters want to cover him on the 
campaign trail they should follow him around he admitted he hasnt 
been making his campaign schedule available but said he might on 
request

informants with tips leading to the arrest of 
murder suspects will be paid up to 10000 under a program that 
district of columbia police hope will slow a record homicide rate 
police chief isaac fulwood holding his first news conference 
friday said the new reward system is based on an existing program 
that pays anonymous individuals up to 1000 for information that 
leads to convictions in robbery theft and assault cases 
at the same time mayor marion barry said a new police overtime 
plan to help slow the pace of killings probably will be scrapped 
because it is too expensive 
fulwood said the more lucrative reward system was needed because 
many district residents have become intimidated by drugrelated 
violence and were afraid to speak up 
there is a tolerance of this what you have to do washington 
dc is get up off your ass if youll pardon the expression and 
call us said fulwood who along with barry unveiled a poster 
with photographs of 18 murder suspects 
later friday police discovered one of the suspects is already 
in the city jail 
police have made arrests in 181 murder cases this year fulwood 
said through friday 274 persons had been killed in the nations 
capital this year compared with 191 at the same time last year in 
1988 a record 372 persons were killed in washington police blame 
more than 60 percent of these slayings on drugs 
the program is fulwoods second attempt in a week to slow the 
citys record homicide rate which increased sharply several weeks 
ago 
on monday fulwood announced that officers working between 3 
pm and 11 pm traditionally the period of highest crime will 
now work until 3 am to help stop the murders 
however barry said after the press conference that the new 
overtime program likely will be abandoned because it costs too much 
police spokesman lt reginald smith said the new overtime 
concept will be reviewed next week and he added that cost will be 
one of the factors considered

to know an edsel is to love an edsel owners of 
the car say and to own one is to put up with a lot of jokes 
the edsel ford motor cos great failure of the late 1950s 
lives on though only about 3500 of them are left on the road the 
car has a certain mystique that draws many edsel owners to 
gatherings such as the 21st annual meeting of the international 
edsel club a fourday affair that ends today 
the club which claims 1500 members holds parts auctions 
exhibitions and awards banquets at its annual gathering which also 
provides a chance for the edsel owners to get together and talk 
about their passion the car whose name for many is synonymous 
with failure 
were proud of our edsels said morris ferguson who brought 
his white 1959 model from memphis tenn for the meeting we 
talk about the love and labor we put into them 
because of the cars lack of success during its time jokesters 
enjoy taking the edsel and its owners for a ride 
i think theyre jealous said richard watson an edsel owner 
from canton ill 
ford launched the gadgety edsel on sept 4 1957 with an 
unprecedented marketing blitz ford lost about 450 million and 
the car was discontinued by 1960 but it has since become the stuff 
of legends 
there have been different theories as to why the edsel bombed 
some say it was a combination of a reaction against the hype a 
recession in the auto industry at the time and the cars unusual 
horse collar grill 
i love the design of it now it was way before its time 
said ferguson 
mike sica of port jefferson ny who drove his white 59 model 
to atlanta said the meetings provide a chance for edsel owners to 
swap or bid to buy parts for their cars 
he said his edsel gets him lots of attention both for its 
unusual looks and its frequent breakdowns 
its embarrassing when they break down and they do that a 
lot but all old cars do that said sica an electrician when 
you break down and pull over on the side of the road everybody 
ribs you 
bob hanson of mableton ga who helped organize this years 
club meeting said the scarcity of spare parts is a problem for 
edsel owners 
edsels are difficult to restore he said its not like a 
mustang or a corvette where you can buy parts over the counter 
most edsel parts were destroyed because ford was so distraught 
over the failure 
many of the edsel owners say their classics are for special 
purposes only they work on them as a hobby and take them out for 
shows 
but ray daumiller 59 yellow of columbus nc said his 
edsel is his main car he takes it to the shows but also uses it to 
go grocery shopping 
its a wonderful car he said kind of stupid and ugly 
looking though

voyager 2 now 12 days from its close 
encounter with neptune has made another discovery that thrilled 
scientists two partial rings of debris orbiting the solar systems 
fourthlargest planet 
there is a mood of total elation here said astronomer rich 
terrile of the national aeronautics and space administrations jet 
propulsion laboratory were really just ecstatic everything 
weve hoped to look at were going to get to see 
early friday voyager 2 photographed the two partial rings 
called ring arcs they are arcshaped belts different from the 
complete rings that encircle saturn uranus and jupiter 
since early july voyager has discovered four small moons 
orbiting neptune in addition to the previously known moons nereid 
and triton 
the probe also has discovered 2700milewide dark bands 
possibly jet streamlike belts of windblown clouds forming a 
collar around neptunes south pole and possibly its north pole 
voyager 2 earlier revealed a 6200milewide dark spot in the 
planets atmosphere probably a giant storm like jupiters great 
red spot 
today voyager 2 traveling at 42198 mph was 272 billion 
miles from earth and 113 million miles from neptune the fourth 
largest planet of the solar system and eighth planet from the sun 
on aug 24 voyager 2 is expected to fly about 3000 miles above 
neptunes cloudtops the probe was launched in 1977 and explored 
jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 
one of the two ring arcs detected friday extends oneeighth of 
the distance around neptunes equator and the other only 
onethirtysixth around the planet that makes them about 30000 
miles and 6000 miles long respectively nasa said terrile said 
they may prove longer upon closer examination 
voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of 
debris associated with nearby moons or may be remnants of moons 
that have been torn apart or ground down through collisions nasa 
said 
scientists dont yet know if the ring arcs are made up of dust 
pebbles or boulders or if the debris consists primarily of rock or 
ice said university of arizona planetary scientist brad smith who 
heads the team analyzing photographs taken by the spacecraft 
researchers also dont know if the two partial rings found by 
voyager are among the three to six ring arcs that scientists 
previously believed they detected from earth but it would be 
surprising if they werent he added 
voyager project scientist edward stone has said voyager may 
discover 50 to 100 partial rings orbiting neptune 
astronomers have long suspected the existence of an 
irregular ring system around neptune nasa said voyagers 
photographs of the rings arcs are the first photographic evidence 
that such a ring system exists 
the three to six previously suspected ring arcs were detected by 
telescopes on earth as neptune passed in front of a distant star 
saturns extensive rings are made mostly of marblesized ice 
pebbles while uranus rings contain very dark boulders of unknown 
composition smith said jupiter is encircled by a single thin ring 
and a sheet of fine dust while saturn has some ring arcs in 
addition to its rings terrile said 
why does neptune have partial rather than complete rings 
thats the 64000 question terrile said rings come in a 
variety of shapes and sizes all the way from complete disks of 
material like weve seen at saturn to narrow thin complete 
ringlets like weve seen at uranus we believe the 
gravitational influence of moons that orbit nearby give rings their 
particular form 
voyager 2 detected the 30000milelong arc just outside the 
orbit of one of the newly discovered moons designated 1989 n4 
which orbits about 23300 miles above neptune the 6000mile long 
arc seems to trail about 50000 miles behind moon 1989 n3 which 
orbits about 17000 miles above neptunes cloudtops nasa said

women run about twice the risk of men of 
becoming depressed and it is misdiagnosed in them up to half the 
time a new report said 
cultural factors are a major reason for the higher incidence 
and a tendency of physicians to interpret depressive symptoms as 
physical illness causes misdiagnosis said ellen mcgrath head of 
the group that drafted the report 
findings of the american psychological association national task 
force on women and depression were discussed friday at the 
associations annual meeting 
the task force examined several studies which have consistently 
found that women run twice the risk of depression as men mcgrath 
said 
the average woman runs about a 25 percent chance of major 
depression and the risk jumps to 51 percent for female physicians 
and 37 percent for female psychologists mcgrath said 
one reason for the high rates is biology since women run about 
a 50 percent chance of mild mood disturbance premenstrually and a 
50 percent to 80 percent of mild depression after giving birth she 
said 
women who take birth control pills also run a heightened risk of 
depression she said 
another reason is what mcgrath called a surprisingly high 
incidence of violence against women research suggests 37 percent 
of women have experienced sexual or physical abuse before age 21 
and some estimates run higher than 50 percent she said 
such abuse can lead to prolonged depression in adult women she 
said 
women are taught to be passive and dependent contributing to 
their depression risk she said 
calling poverty a pathway to depression she said 75 percent 
of the nations poor are women and children 
some 71 percent of women have had a significant instance of 
sexual harassment on the job she said 
several studies suggest a misdiagnosis rate of 30 percent to 50 
percent in women she said 
the problem appears because depressed women often seek help by 
telling obstetricians family doctors or internal medicine 
specialists that they feel poorly or are tired mcgrath said 
the physicians frequently approach it as a medical problem and 
try to treat it that way which does not work she said 
mcgrath said she did not know how frequently male depressives 
are misdiagnosed 
stephen scheiber a psychiatry professor at northwestern 
university said in a telephone interview that a 50 percent 
misdiagnosis estimate sounds high 
certainly we all know it happens he said but he knew of no 
study of rates of misdiagnosing depression 
physicians learn about depression as part of their training he 
said but he also noted that federal mental health officials are 
encouraging family physicians and specialists to recognize 
depression in their patients 
scheiber also said the doubled rate of depression for women in 
comparison to men showed up in a recent study of five communities 
while not a nationally representative sample the work provides the 
best available estimate of depression rates he said

panamanian troops briefly detained american 
soldiers in another confrontation between both sides and gen 
manuel noriega again indicated he has no intention of stepping down 
as panamas leader 
noriega today marked six years as head of the panamanian defense 
forces and the nations de facto ruler 
he said friday that a plebiscite proposed by the opposition for 
aug 20 on whether he should resign was tantamount to turning 
panama into a colony that accepts arrogance vassalage and 
indignity 
he spoke during a parade of thousands of troops and paramilitary 
civilian units ending a 10day exercise called zap the intruder 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington on 
friday that the bush administration would not rule out seizing 
noriega and taking him to florida to face drug trafficking charges 
but fitzwater said bush was not contemplating such a move at this 
time 
the latest confrontation between panamanian and us troops 
occurred in a remote area known as curundu near the panama canal 
the us southern command says the area is a military zone shared 
by both countries while the panamanians claim it is exclusively 
their domain 
a defense forces patrol detained four vehicles carrying a number 
of us military police and the southern command said it quickly 
dispatched troops backed by armored cars and helicopters 
the incident started when american troops went around in 
civilian clothes with their weapons riding in private vehicles in 
violation of the panama canal treaties said panamanian maj 
carlos saldana 
no country in the world can accept that units claiming to be 
part of an army move in within its territory armed and in civilian 
clothes he said if they tried to do this in any other nation 
they would be killed like common muggers like a vulgar thief 
the confrontation ended after a meeting between panamanian and 
american military officers a southern command news release said 
the command called the detentions unjustified 
the vehicles were freed after us military officers discussed 
the situation with officers of the defense forces said a news 
release issued by the command 
neither the panamanians nor the americans said how many us 
military police or what kind of vehicles were involved 
similar incidents in recent weeks coincided with southern 
command exercises and there have been arrests on both sides 
earlier this week american troops blockaded fort amador which 
contains us and panamanian military facilities 
us officials insist they have the right to conduct exercises 
under the 1977 panama canal treaties to assure canal security 
noriega however accuses the united states of seeking to abrogate 
the treaties and keep the canal which is to be turned over to 
panama at the end of 1999 
the united states has been trying to pressure noriega to quit as 
head of the military since two federal grand juries in florida 
indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in 
february 1988 however tactics that have included economic and 
trade sanctions have failed to budge noriega 
guillermo endara the opposition leader who proposed holding the 
plebiscite on noriegas rule responded a few hours after noriegas 
rejection friday by calling the leader a dictator endara also 
accused noriega of subservience to the united states 
we never were and never will be employees of the cia while he 
himself was one endara said in an interview 
international observers say the opposition won the may 7 
presidential election by a landslide noriegas regime annulled the 
balloting a few days later saying there had been vote fraud

suspended us diplomat felix bloch said 
he was in paris the day he allegedly left a briefcase in a 
restaurant for a soviet agent but he declined to confirm or deny 
spying allegations against him 
bloch spoke in an austrian television and radio interview 
broadcast friday from washington 
it was the second time in the past week that he declined 
opportunities in interviews with austrian media to deny the 
suspicions 
the austrianborn diplomat formerly the no 2 man in viennas 
us embassy was suspended from the state department on june 22 
in washington the justice department friday said public 
disclosure of its investigation of bloch 54 had compromised the 
governments ability to obtain evidence against him 
there is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case 
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation 
did compromise the investigation department spokesman david 
runkel said without elaboration 
no charges have been brought against bloch he remains under 
investigation and surveillance by the fbi and reporters have 
followed him around washington in recent days 
abc news has reported that on may 14 bloch arrived in paris 
from new york and met his alleged contact for dinner bloch left 
his briefcase under the table to be picked up by the suspected 
soviet agent abc said 
asked by austrian tv correspondent robert wiesner whether he was 
in paris may 14 bloch said after a long pause yes 
he declined however to specify whether he met reino gikman a 
man holding finnish documents who regularly visited vienna during 
blochs 198087 tour in the austrian capital gikman has been 
identified by austrian and us authorities as a suspected kgb 
agent who might have been a contact man 
us sources have said bloch contends he only knew the man as a 
stamp collector 
when wiesner pressed bloch for details of the paris trip bloch 
said i was in paris may 14 i was in a restaurant and there 
were very many people in that restaurant and i enjoyed the food 
there very much 
have you missed your briefcase since asked wiesner after 
another long pause bloch who seemed relaxed and spoke in his 
native german said no 
wiesner repeatedly pressed bloch to deny he was a spy 
why dont you just say it was all just invented he asked 
i could say much on this topic but i will restrain myself 
bloch answered 
by remaining silent wiesner noted bloch only heightens 
suspense i dont want people to feel bored during august 
bloch said smiling 
are the accusations against you justified wiesner asked 
again several minutes later this question i cannot answer now 
bloch responded 
in a much briefer interview in the current issue of the austrian 
weekly profil bloch was similarly elusive asked why he did not 
say straight out he is not a spy he replied there are 
accusations there is no proof my guilt must be proved 
bloch first accepted an invitation to visit the washington 
offices of austrias staterun television 10 days ago but declined 
then to be interviewed 
wiesner said the second visit on thursday began with bloch 
viewing cassettes of vienna the two chatted about viennese 
cemeteries and then bloch agreed to answer questions he said

two foundries and a willingness to 
support public art has turned the sweetheart city long known 
as the town with the special valentines day postmark into a haven 
for sculptors 
art is in focus all the time here said sculptor fritz 
white 59 who moved to loveland in 1978 from cincinnati weve 
infiltrated the rotary club the chamber of commerce all kinds of 
groups 
about 40 professional sculptors have moved to the northern 
colorado city most of them in the past five years and dozens of 
others come to town part of the year to work with lovelands two 
foundries 
loveland is smitten with sculpture displaying its own 
collection along roadsides at a sculpture park around a new civic 
center and in galleries and studios around town 
this weekend the city is the site of one of the largest 
sculpture shows in the world sculpture in the park nearly 190 
sculptors from around the nation are exhibiting work and officials 
hope the show will net the city even more than the 35 million it 
did last year 
susan hallsten mcgarry editor of houstonbased southwest art 
magazine called both the town and the huge sculpture show a 
pretty major force as to an actual art event that changes every 
year with different people bringing new work i dont think you can 
get a broader exposure to a larger number of working sculptors 
anywhere in the united states 
the city about 40 miles north of denver that has struggled to 
become known for something more than a place to get a special 
valentines day postal cancellation began its love affair with 
sculpture back in 1972 then a local metal foundry that made parts 
for general motors began casting bronze for sculptures and soon was 
accepting work from artists around the region 
eventually it drew the artists themselves to loveland giving 
many of them jobs in the business 
a second foundry loveland sculpture works was started by 
former employees of the original foundry art castings of colorado 
five sculptors who had come to loveland to be near the foundry 
george lundeen dan ostermiller george walbye white and hollis 
williford approached the city several years ago about helping 
promote the arts 
the result was the private loveland high plains arts council 
which raises money to buy works and then donates them to the city 
the city does its part as well in 1985 loveland became the 
first colorado city to pass an ordinance setting aside 1 percent of 
the construction costs of any public project over 50000 to buy 
original artwork 
susan ison director of the citys visual arts commission said 
loveland now has more than 1 million worth of art 
in return the influx of artists breathes new life into the 
citys economy and cultural life 
its an industry in itself city manager mike rock said of 
sculpture which employs more than 400 people in the community of 
38200 
rock said lovelands commitment to the arts has helped economic 
development efforts 
we can demonstrate to a company that its a fairly 
sophisticated community it has hometown values but an unmatched 
level of art and many communityminded citizens he said 
downtown merchants too are sponsoring a sculpture park on a 
prime corner to help attract more people 
for the artists that kind of attention and camaraderie make 
loveland an attractive place 
white williford moved to loveland from denver nine years ago to 
be in the foundrys hip pocket 
above all williford said he likes the cooperative atmosphere 
among loveland sculptors 
in a large city its more dogeatdog people are less 
willing to share theres too many rats in a cage when artists 
back east come visit and we open our doors to them they cant 
believe it

difficulty

an antiabortion protester promised to appeal a 
jurys finding that she and two other activists conspired to shut 
down an abortion clinic that was the target of several arson fires 
before closing its doors 
its a perversion of the first amendment dottie roberts 
said after the jury ruled she violated federal racketeering laws 
and owed civil damages to the clinic operators this ones going 
to the supreme court 
the jury ruled friday that curtis beseda serving 20 years in a 
texas federal prison for setting fire to the feminist womens 
health center in everett violated the racketeer influenced corrupt 
organizations statute through arson and extortion directed at the 
clinic 
beseda roberts 53 and sharon codispoti conspired to violate 
the statute the jury also found 
beseda who told the jury earlier in the monthlong trial that 
he had no intention of setting any fire until he heard god tell him 
to do it was ordered to pay 268500 in civil damages beseda 
roberts and codispoti will share another 11000 fine as well as 
the clinics legal expenses and court costs 
all damages can be trebled under the rico statute the 
plaintiffs had sought 560029 
two other defendants bonnie and michael undseth of snohomish 
were acquitted 
i know that i didnt do anything wrong said codispoti of 
lake stevens at this point im taking my strength from that 
if i had to to it all over again id still go out and picket 
the abortion clinic 
the lawsuit is only the second time the racketeering statute 
established to fight organized crime has been used against 
abortion protesters 
damages will go to several clinic employees and to the feminist 
womens health center of yakima parent clinic to the one that 
burned 
im delighted said william j bender lawyer for the 
clinic who said he found the decision fundamentally important 
it should be a clear message to anyone who protests abortion 
clinics in the future he said 
lawyer theresa schrempp representing roberts promised an 
appeal she said she could not understand how there could be a 
conspiracy if jurors did not find her client had actually violated 
the racketeering act 
to win under the racketeering statute one must show that an 
enterprise adversely affected interstate commerce and constituted a 
pattern of illegal acts such as arson extortion wire fraud 
robbery kidnapping or murder said edmond tiryak the civil rights 
attorney who tried a recent precedentsetting case in philadelphia 
there 26 individuals were found to have committed multiple acts 
of extortion at an abortion clinic the clinic was awarded 100000 
the philadelphia case was upheld on appeal in march and 
defendants have asked the us supreme court to hear it 
the everett clinic was burned three times between december 1983 
and april 1984 then closed its doors 
a conspiracy is so hard to prove said diane hale a 
director of the former clinic i think its really wonderful that 
we were able to do it and the jury believed us if we could do it 
other people could do it too this is a way they can protect 
themselves

a railroad company will pay an indian tribe 
12 million to end a centuryold dispute over reservation land 
acquired in the 1860s when the industry steamed its way west 
as far as the railroad is concerned weve settled with the 
indians and were out of it nathan jenkins an attorney for the 
southern pacific transportation co said friday how the money 
is distributed is up to the government and the tribe 
representatives for the walker river paiute tribe could not be 
reached by telephone for comment on the trespassing case 
us district court judge howard mckibben on wednesday signed an 
order approving the 12 million settlement which will be held by 
the court until officials decide how to distribute the money 
jenkins said the classaction lawsuit potentially involves from 
300 to 500 walker river paiutes who could get a share of the 
settlement 
the tribe initially sought as much as 16 million while the 
railroad said the disputed land was worth only about 750 when 
southern pacific acquired it the railroad at first offered a 
30000 settlement in the case 
the dispute involves about 400 acres in westcentral nevada from 
wabuska in lyon county to near the northern end of the walker river 
in mineral county 
the tribe filed suit in 1972 because the railroad never 
officially gained congressional approval for a right of way through 
the walker river indian reservation to lay out its tracks 
the indians said that as a result southern pacific was 
trespassing and the tribe should be compensated for the use of the 
land that rightfully should belong to the paiutes 
the 9th circuit court of appeals in san francisco agreed with 
the indians that the railroad failed to comply with several federal 
acts governing tribal lands the appeals court last year remanded 
the case to the district level to award trespassing damages to the 
tribe 
more than 100 year ago the indians agreed to take 750 for the 
land along with the promise from southern pacific for free rides to 
indians forever 
the railroad agreed but never built passenger cars for the 
trains that ran on the line which carried mostly explosives for 
area military operations and other goods 
as a result indians were forced to ride in boxcars or cattle 
cars or on top of the trains sometimes falling off according to 
old newspaper clippings 
members of the tribe were basically treated like cattle 
says edgar cook kansas city mo economist who studied the 
history of the line for the us justice department

for it 
sixtyyearold julius russell jr claimed he lost the ticket 
circuit judge robert sklodowski believed him and ordered the

sharon sharp lottery director said the state hasnt decided 
whether to appeal the ruling 
the lottery no longer has the 3 million which has been turned 
over to the state if the ruling stands the lottery may have to 
ask for a special appropriation ms sharp said 
russell played the same numbers each week 41416293741 
said peter andjelkovich russells attorney 
andjelkovich said russell didnt find out he had won until a 
year after the drawing when russells daughter julie recognized 
the winning number in a newspaper article that said no one had yet 
claimed the 3 million lotto prize 
russell screamed oh my god and started digging through his 
lottery tickets andjelkovich said but he couldnt find it 
russell and 22 other people filed claims with the lottery for 
the prize 
all were rejected because none had the actual ticket ms sharp

the spiritual leader of the reputed 
umbrella group for kidnappers offered to help free foreign hostages 
if western powers secure the release of arabs jailed in israel 
let us get to an agreement together so that each side would 
use his own means and influence to end the crisis of the hostages 
all hostages and resolve the problem of arab prisoners sheik 
mohammed hussein fadlallah said friday 
fadlallah who advises the proiranian hezbollah spoke at the 
bir elabed mosque in the shiite moslem slums of south beirut 
during ashoura ceremonies commemorating the most revered shiite 
saint imam hussein bin ali grandson of the prophet mohammed 
shiites held ashoura parades friday trampling israeli and 
american flags inscribed death to israel death to america 
eight americans and eight other western hostages are held in 
lebanon most of them by radical shiite groups believed associated 
with hezbollah whose name means party of god 
fadlallahs statement seemed to corroborate an offer made 
earlier this month by the captors of joseph cicippio after they 
suspended plans to kill the american hostage 
they said they would free cicippio if israel released 450 arab 
prisoners and allowed 55 palestinian deportees to return to the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip 
israel has offered to exchange sheik abdul karim obeid a 
hezbollahaffiliated cleric kidnapped july 28 in southern lebanon 
and hundreds of other lebanese shiite prisoners for three israelis 
soldiers held in lebanon and the western hostages hezbollah has 
refused to negotiate 
in washington white house spokesman marlin fitzwater called 
fadlallahs comments interesting and said the bush 
administration hopes it signals their desire to release the 
hostages 
we would like to lower our voices a little and let these 
issues play out for a few days and see what happens he said 
parades marking the ashoura holiday were held in south beirut 
and in towns in eastern and southern lebanon with predominantly 
shiite populations 
the ashoura holiday commemorates the killing of the saint 
hussein by moslem armies after a 10day siege at karbala now part 
of iraq the battle was part of the fight over succession to 
mohammed that eventually split islam into sunni and shiite branches 
about 10000 men women and children participated in south 
beirut most were dressed in black and beat their heads and chests 
ahead of the marchers were loudspeaker vans covered with black 
cloth and portraits of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini the iranian 
revolutionary patriarch who died in june and his successor ali 
khamenei

the soviet justice minister said estonias effort 
to tighten voting residency laws that have sparked a strike by 
thousands of russian workers is unconstitutional 
a nationwide newspaper placed the number of strikers in the 
small baltic republic at about 40000 more than twice as many as 
local journalists and the official tass news agency estimated 
veniamin yakovlev soviet justice minister friday told the 
evening television news program vremya that estonia ought to 
reconsider the law which sets residence requirements to protect 
estonians hold on the republic 
i think its obvious that this estonian law doesnt correspond 
to our constitution yakovlev said this means that a 
significant portion of the population will be left out 
yakovlev said the law passed tuesday also violated 
international conventions on civil rights that the soviet union has 
signed 
but instead of flatly declaring the law void yakovlev appealed 
to the estonian supreme soviet to reconsider it 
under the law residents of estonia cannot vote unless they have 
lived in the same district for at least two years or have lived 
anywhere in the republic for a total of five years 
candidates for elective office must live in the same place for 
five years or in estonia for 10 years 
russianspeaking workers walked off their jobs the day after the 
law was passed and sent a delegation to moscow to seek meetings 
with national officials vasily makismov a member of the strike 
committee said in an interview from tallinn that one member of the 
delegation had returned and was meeting with strikers this morning 
maksimov said railroad stations were on strike and that the 
staterun aeroflot airline was shipping only emergency items such 
as medical supplies and equipment passenger service was not 
affected 
the newspaper sotsialisticheskaya industriya reported today that 
more than 30 factories and other staterun businesses were on 
strike including about 40000 workers 
dialogue between the leaders of the republic and the strikers 
has practically come to a halt it said 
the estonian leadership acknowledged in a statement released 
friday that it failed to take into account fully the growth of 
national consciousness among the nonestonian population of the 
republic tass reported 
the estonian parliament banned strikes thursday but the 
strikers ignored the action 
tass on friday put the number of strikers in tallinn at 16000 
a few enterprises in kokhlajarve a mining town east of tallinn 
also were reported to be on strike 
strike committee members said workers at 42 estonian factories 
and firms walked out but local journalists said they counted only 
about 24 estonian enterprises with striking employees 
nonestonian residents of the republic including leaders of the 
russiandominated intermovement group complain the law is aimed at 
them because many are new arrivals 
they are also upset by a law making estonian the official 
language 
ethnic estonians make up slightly more than 60 percent of the 
population russians make up about a third of the 16 million 
people 
sotsialisticheskaya industriya quoted striking workers as 
complaining that they want to get into courses to learn estonian 
but that the few available are crowded and expensive

head has died

taylor

typically american taylor first shot his wife to death in the 
couples home and then drove to work at the orange glenn post 
office where he killed two colleagues and wounded another 
taylor then turned the gun on himself 
it may be that taylor just snapped said sgt dan star the

family members taylors home located about seven blocks from the 
post office and car also were searched but officers found no notes 
or letters to explain his actions 
star said taylor shot his wife in her sleep at least three times 
with a 22caliber semiautomatic pistol and then went to the post 
office where he opened fire on two friends ronald williams 56 
and richard berni 38 
williams and berni were shot as they drank coffee and talked 
taylor typically joined them in the routine star said 
taylor then went into the post office and fired at least five

four us blackhawk helicopters 
joined an aerial search today for rep mickey leland and 15 others 
missing since their plane left for a southwestern refugee camp five 
days ago 
also today ethiopian helicopters rechecked one of two areas 
outside the planes flight path where a satellite picked up an 
apparent distress signal said james haley us embassy spokesman 
in the capital 
the uh60 blackhawk helicopters arrived friday from eglin air 
force base in florida and joined two us c130 hercules cargo 
planes in the search of the rugged mountains southwest of the 
capital haley said 
they are capable of staying in the air all day because the 
c130s have refueling capability haley said 
he said search efforts by the c130s was concentrated on the 
intended flight path of the twinengine plane that disappeared 
monday with leland on board the texas democrat chairman of the 
house select committee on hunger was accompanied by eight other 
americans 
the twin otter aircraft owned by ethiopias government relief 
agency was en route from addis ababa to the fugnido refugee camp 
450 miles away near the sudanese border 
the c130s joined the search thursday when they arrived from 
west germany 
haley said today that the weather was not cooperating but 
they are able to search 
weather has hampered the search since it began tuesday and may 
have played a role in the disappearance of the canadianmade plane 
which seats up to 20 passengers officials have said the planes 
takeoff monday morning was delayed two hours by rough weather and 
that it departed in heavy clouds and poor visibility 
the site of the apparent distress signal being checked again is 
in an area around goba about 85 miles southeast of the capital 
haley said 
the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in 
washington has said its weather satellites picked up signals in 
that area as well as about 100 miles north of addis ababa a land 
and air search of both areas on friday turned up nothing 
asked how the satellites could have recorded false signals 
haley replied ive been trying to get an answer to that myself 
lelands plane was equipped with an emergency locator 
transmittor a device usually mouted in the tail of an aircraft and 
activated either automatically by impact or manually by the pilot 
us state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said in 
washington friday the passengers had some box lunches one or two 
cases of soft drinks and 35 gallons of water the prospect of 
temperatures that can drop to freezing at night was a troubling 
factor 
planes must fly over mountainous terrain to reach the fugnido 
refugee camp but the route was not over the area where rebels are 
battling ethiopias government ethiopias separatist movements are 
based in the northern part of the country in the horn of africa 
a spokeswoman for leland complained friday that the rescue 
effort lacked urgency 
with all of the sophisticated surveillance that we have with 
all of the sophisticated equipment we have we should have located 
them by now alma newsom said in washington 
president bush the state department and defense department 
defended the search efforts which involved scores of us military 
personnel 
i can understand the anxiety of all this and i can understand 
the concern that people that love mickey leland feel and that i 
feel bush said but theres a lot going on so lets just hope 
and pray hes ok 
the pentagon said late friday that 170 military personnel had 
been assigned to the search and that the number soon would reach 
260 
air force maj gen james f record director of operations for 
central command was to leave today to take charge of the search 
the pentagon said 
the pentagon said in a statement that two u2 photographic 
reconnaissance planes had exposed more than a mile of film in runs 
over the 56000square mile search area of which about 60 percent 
was covered by clouds 
twelve ethiopian helicopters also participated in the search 
haley said the eight other americans aboard included three 
members of lelands staff a friend of the congressmans three 
officers of the us agency for international development officers 
and the spouse of one aid official also aboard were an ethiopian 
employee of the us embassy three ethiopian officials and the 
crew 
two of lelands congressional colleagues reps gary ackerman 
and alan wheat arrived in addis ababa early friday to observe the 
search effort with them was jack russ the sergeantatarms of the 
house 
fugnido camp is run by the un high commissioner for refugees 
and is one of four in the region that house more than 300000 
refugees who have fled civil war in neighboring sudan

the new foreign minister says americans are to 
blame for trade friction with his country because they dont 
understand japan speak its language or try hard enough to 
penetrate the japanese market 
the comments by taro nakayama on friday came the same day prime 
minister toshiki kaifu said he will visit washington next month to 
meet with president bush and reaffirm relations with the united 
states as the foundation of japans foreign policy 
nakayama a physician appointed wednesday after kaifu took 
office said us efforts are lacking and that japans 
distribution system should not be held responsible for trade 
tensions 
while i am of course aware of the various opinions emanating 
from the us side in regard to japans distribution system the 
distribution systems of the united states and japan differ as the 
countries themselves differ he said 
he said japan must speak its mind to bring the united states 
around to its way of thinking 
many us business leaders blame the large us trade deficit 
with japan 55 billion last year on japanese trade barriers 
and american lawmakers have called for retaliatory action 
americans often complain that japans complex distribution 
system in which longstanding relationships and delivery practices 
take precedence over efficiency and cost cutting are major 
barriers to us goods 
the foreign minister said americans have made considerable 
progress in improving their understanding of the japanese market 
but still depend too much on japanese who speak english rather than 
learning the language themselves 
how many americans working in japan can speak perfect 
japanese he said 
nakayama was a member of a liberal democratic party committee 
that negotiated in washington on trade issues referring to that 
experience he said 
americans then appeared to understand japan but in fact did 
not thats why it is so necessary to talk at length with the 
united states if that is not done the united states as can be 
expected of them will come up with various unilateral moves 
in an interview with kyodo news service nakayama was quoted as 
saying he expected the soviet union to offer to return a group of 
small islands off northern japan in exchange for japanese 
technology and investment 
soviet soldiers have occupied the islands since the end of world 
war ii and the dispute over them has kept the two nations from 
signing a peace treaty 
as international relations change the soviet government 
authorities change and their way of thinking will change as well to 
adapt to international circumstances nakayama was quoted as 
saying 
kaifu on friday pledged to push political and tax reform as a 
way of preventing the kind of scandals and unpopular policies that 
brought down his two predecessors and cost his governing liberal 
democrats an upper house election 
he succeeded sousuke uno who resigned after only two months in 
office to take responsibility for the governing partys election 
defeat last month the liberal democrats lost their majority in the 
upper house of parliament for the first time since the party was 
formed in 1955 
uno took over from noboru takeshita who resigned june 2 to take 
responsibility for the recruit co influencebuying scandal which 
reached the top ranks of politics the bureaucracy and business 
uno also was plagued by allegations that he had kept paid 
mistresses 
on friday only two days after taking office kaifu denied a 
newspaper report that he had an illegitimate child as the result of 
an affair with a model and he demanded a retraction

benefits and other important areas to parsons vice president 
of district 6 of the cwa said friday the union represents about 
40000 southwestern bell employees in missouri arkansas kansas 
oklahoma and texas 
the proposal offers union employees guaranteed jobs and a bigger 
pay increase but it still requires them to pay part of their 
health insurance bills the company has picked up the entire health 
insurance tab in the past 
meanwhile striking electrical workers friday held their first 
formal talks with bell atlantic since the strike began early 
sunday bell atlantic spokesman thomas duddy did not disclose the

issues bell atlantic operates in the district of columbia 
maryland virginia west virginia new jersey delaware and

shouted scab at phone company managers and customers who 
crossed a picket line one customer received a police escort to 
leave the building 
myles calvey business manager of local 2222 of the 
international brotherhood of electrical workers said the strikers 
would not accept the companys demands to share in health insurance 
costs even if that meant a long strike 
you cant sell something like this when the membership doesnt 
want it calvey said 
nynex has paid 100 percent of its employees health insurance 
costs for more than a decade but now wants its workers to 
contribute 
in new york 32 of the states union local presidents are 
scheduled to meet tuesday to plan a campaign to urge a national 
phone bill boycott 
what we are going to do is put the word out across the country 
that people living in any struck area should not pay their

registration of presidential candidates 
closed with a christian democrat backed by a 17party opposition 
group pitted against an excabinet member under rightist military 
president augusto pinochet 
also friday a government spokesman said cabinet changes will be 
announced next week he said some ministers were expected to step 
down and run for senator in the scheduled dec 14 general 
elections the first since a bloody 1973 coup led by pinochet 
patricio aylwin 70 the centrist christian democratic party 
president and hernan buchi 40 finance minister for four years 
until he resigned in april were the principal presidential 
candidates to register with the national elections board 
a conservative businessman francisco errazuriz and an 
internationally recognized child nutrition specialist fernando 
monckeberg also registered but were not expected to draw 
widespread support 
opinion polls show aylwin a former senate president with a 
huge lead over buchi aylwin is supported by 17 centrist and 
leftist parties that united last year to defeat a referendum 
proposal that pinochet remain in power until 1997 
buchi emerged only thursday night as the principal 
progovernment candidate when a rival sergio jarpa 68 announced 
he would not run for president 
buchi an independent is backed by the pinochet government and 
a wellfinanced group of business leaders they pressed jarpa 
leader of national renovation not to split the progovernment camp 
by opposing buchi national renovation is the principal rightist 
party 
pinochet could not run because the constitution prohibits a 
president from holding two consecutive terms he has said he plans 
however to remain commander of the countrys powerful army for 
eight more years the law bars the new president from removing him 
from that post 
registration of candidates for the house of deputies also ended 
on friday with more than 300 pursuing the houses 120 seats 
registration of candidates for the 38 senate seats ends sept 7 
pinochet 73 seized power on sept 11 1973 toppling an 
elected leftist government during a period of social and economic 
disorder he was obliged to call elections when voters last october 
rejected a proposal that he remain the nations leader until 1997

animal rights campaigners crept onto moors before 
dawn in northern england today to disrupt an already quiet glorious 
twelfth of august the traditional opening of the grouse season 
about 90 supporters of the hunt saboteurs association occupied 
two northern english moors in geltsdale near carlisle and stanhope 
to shoo away the birds said a spokesman ben ponton 
the action will go on as long as it has to he said the 
shooting parties are driving around but have made no attempt to get 
onto the moors 
another 100 members had also gathered in bowland but thick mist 
had kept hunters away said ponton whose group annually tries to 
disrupt the shooting of the prized game 
aristocrats and wealthy tourists organize hunting parties on 
scottish and english moors to kick off the glorious twelfth and in 
past years restaurants have vied to bring the birds to the table 
but this year disease has decimated the flocks leading to the 
cancellation of many shoots 
grouse numbers are 20 percent down in some parts of scotland 
and theres no shooting at all today in parts of the north of 
england where populations have fallen 50 percent said dr peter 
hudson of the private research group the game conservancy 
influenced by the animal protesters of recent years and worries 
over declining numbers of the birds hotels and restaurants have 
all but dropped their own colorful races to serve the birds 
the prestigious gleneagles hotel once a forerunner in the 
competition said it will donate the money it would have used for 
the race to grouse preservation research for a fifth year 
but the bird will still feature on the menu of some restaurants 
served with thin fried potatoes parsley and a bread sauce

indian troops killed at least 51 
civilians after being attacked by tamil rebels in a northern town 
tamil sources said today 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 40 houses 
and 23 shops were set on fire by the soldiers after an army patrol 
was ambushed aug 2 in the town of velvettiturai 200 miles north 
of colombo at least six soldiers were killed in the attack 
military officials said at the time 
the tamil sources who have proved reliable in the past quoted 
residents as saying the indian peacekeeping troops imposed a 
48hour curfew on velvettiturai after the ambush and carried out 
search operations 
many houses were shelled and several people were burned to 
death the sources said they said that 51 victims were identified 
by relatives after the curfew was withdrawn 
the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the rebel group fighting 
the indians said in a statement telexed to newspaper offices that 
at least 70 civilians were killed in the offensive the tigers 
accounts of casualties have proved to be exaggerated in the past 
sri lankan military officials confirmed a major operation by 
indian troops occurred in velvettiturai but they said they did not 
have details because they do not operate in the tamildominated 
areas of the country 
in new delhi a government spokesman said there were 18 civilian 
casualties in an exchange of gunfire between the soldiers and the 
rebels after the ambush 
he said the rebels used civilians as cover while firing with 
rocketpropelled grenades and automatic rifles at the indian army 
patrol 
the troops returned fire and 30 bodies were recovered after 
the fighting said the spokesman who cannot be identified under 
briefing rules at least five were hardcore tigers and seven 
others were sympathizers 
eighteen unfortunate civilians were killed in the cross 
fire he said the spokesman denied that civilians were killed 
during the curfew 
the tamils in velvettiturai will say whatever the tigers tell 
them to he said the tigers capacity to kill fellow tamils is 
unlimited and they live in fear of retribution 
indian soldiers have been in sri lankas tamildominated north 
and east for the past two years to put down the tamil war for an 
independent homeand 
they were deployed to supervise an indiasponsored accord under 
which sri lanka offered tamils limited autonomy in exchange for an 
arms surrender but the tigers rejected the agreement and turned 
their guns on the indians 
india got involved because of the sympathies of its own 60 
million tamils to the rebel cause 
tamils comprise 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people and 
allege they are discriminated against by the sinhalese who make up 
75 percent of the population and control the government and the

a large ira bomb exploded 
downtown today hours before protestants marched through the streets 
on the tense anniversaries of both ancient and recent sectarian 
strife in the region 
the bomb caused no injuries and the annual apprentice boys 
parade marking the end of a catholic siege of the city 300 years 
ago began on schedule 
marching bands featuring piping flutes and humming accordions 
alternated with men carrying banners commemorating the siege 
the way we look at it were more besieged than ever before 
said robert kerr a protestant farmer from dungannon district as 
he watched the marchers the bomb means we have no security for 
the amount of money theyre spending we should get better 
security 
sectarian violence at the parade 20 years ago led to the 
deployment of british troops in the province two days later and 
heralded the start of the sectarian and political warfare that has 
torn the province since then 
supporters of the irish republican army fighting the troops plan 
a march sunday in belfast to mark the anniversary and the 
introduction of an unpopular british policy of internment since 
ended but not forgotten 
security forces were on full alert throughout the province and 
extra police and soldiers were stationed in londonderry 
police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 am in a butcher 
street bar which was extensively damaged it had been 
discovered by security forces who evacuated the area but it 
exploded before army experts could defuse it said a spokesman who 
refused to be named 
the bar which was closed was near the parade route on the 
fringes of a catholic area where extra police were to be deployed 
he said its close to an area where there might be opposition to 
the parade he said 
later the outlawed mainly roman catholic ira claimed 
responsibility for the bomb saying it was timed to go off while 
security forces were in the area 
an estimated 15000 protestants were expected to turn out for 
the parade marking the relief of the city in august 1689 from the 
besieging army of catholic king james ii it is named after the 13 
apprentice boys who shut the city gates against james army at the 
start of the 105day siege 
on sunday the belfast parade will mark the 18th anniversary of 
the nowabandoned policy of internment without trial for terrorist 
suspects introduced aug 9 1971 as well as the arrival of british 
troops 
almost 2000 people were held for varying lengths of time 
without trial before britain abandoned internment in december 1975 
following worldwide condemnation 
ira supporters who were the main targets of internment 
continue to mark the anniversary of its introduction each year with 
bonfirelit demonstrations and sporadic rioting sometimes lasting 
several days 
tension has been heightened by the death of a 15yearold 
catholic seamus duffy british news reports said he died wednesday 
when he was hit by a plastic bullet fired by police after they were 
attacked during antiinternment rioting in belfast but his friends 
and family deny he was involved in rioting 
about 1000 mourners attended the boys funeral in belfast on 
friday which passed peacefully but caused rioting friday night by 
catholic youths in the north belfast area where he lived 
cars were set on fire and two youths were injured when police 
fired plastic bullets to control the trouble reported the british 
new agency press association 
british troops in the province currently number more than 
10000 compared a peak of 22000 at the height of the violence in 
1972 
they are backed by 6500 members of the ulster defense regiment 
a locally recruited unit of the british army

eastern airlines striking unions today launched a 
large new lobbying effort after a week when hundreds of their own 
pilots and flight attendants crossed picket lines 
now theyre out there telling the world its over well its 
not over charles e bryan leader of easterns machinists union 
exhorted some 300 people at a morning rally across the street from 
eastern corporate headquarters so hang in there therell be 
good news coming 
bryan joined henry a duffy national president of the air line 
pilots association and other leaders on the first blocks of a 
moving picket line march that began a 26day 13state series 
of parades motorcades rallies and lobbying efforts 
before this is over the whole countrys going to wake up to 
whats going on said john j bavis chairman of the eastern 
pilots union local 
the aflcio machinists and flight attendants are also 
participating in the rallies but the strikes sixth month has 
begun with a wave of picketline defections prompting eastern to 
say friday it no longer needed to hire pilots 
eastern which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
five days after being hit by a crippling strike by its three unions 
march 4 plans to rebuild to an airline twothirds its prestrike 
size the companys plan for its creditors said it would be flying 
800 daily flights with 1700 pilots by the end of the year 
eastern has 350 daily flights compared to nearly 1100 before 
the strike 
company spokesman robin matell declined to give figures on 
easterns pilots but sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
have said more than 600 union pilots are flying including some 250 
who have crossed picket lines since the union leadership last 
weekend discussed ending the strike 
eastern has graduated 300 newly hired pilots from training and 
has from 700 to 800 in training 
veteran pilots who want to return to work now will instead be 
put on a preferential recall list and given priority for future 
openings matell said 
hank weber spokesman for easterns air line pilots association 
was skeptical about whether eastern has hired enough qualified 
pilots but said fridays announcement will stop the flow of pilot 
crossovers 
there were people who crossed the picket line because of 
uncertainty weber said that will stop now thank you 
eastern 
weber said the vast majority of the 3600 alpa eastern pilots 
remain strongly committed to the strike 
meanwhile officials said the number of flight attendants 
abandoning the strike after more than five months has also jumped 
this week 
a source who spoke on the condition of not being identified said 
140 flight attendants crossed the picket lines this week probably 
because of perceptions that the pilot crossovers hurt the strike 
im not really sure on the complete impact said mary jane 
barry president of the flight attendants union when theres a 
breaking in the ranks it affects all of us 
she said she didnt have any figures on total flight attendant 
crossovers but did not dispute a figure of at least 1000 from the 
unions 6000 members 
easterns rebuilding plan calls for 3400 flight attendants 
company officials have said 1000 new flight attendants have been 
hired or are in training eastern has received 31000 applications 
and is being very very selective matell said 
the 8500member machinists union joined by the other two 
unions when it struck march 4 after 1 years of federal mediation 
failed has held relatively solid some 100 union mechanics are 
working for eastern which also has hired several hundred more and 
is using 700 supervisors in maintenance roles 
eastern wants 2500 mechanics by years end the company has 
said

easy par i was all over the course if it hadnt been for my

didnt feel any letdown i just had to work hard to keep it 
together 
palmer parred the last five holes and said i still feel good 
and i feel good about the way im hitting the ball 
it marked the first time palmer has made the cut in a major 
tournament since the 1987 pga he made the cut in all four majors 
in 1983 
play was suspended friday for one hour 48 minutes in the 
afternoon because of a rainstorm 
once again the 7197yard kemper lakes layout had ideal playing 
conditions despite the rain delay and the games greatest players 
took advantage 
reid who missed only one green and one fairway thursday missed 
five fairways and four greens in the second round 
it wasnt as pretty reid said but i showed some 
character i hung in there and got the most out of my round 
stadler called his round very enjoyable i made all the three 
four fivefoot putts i had i didnt miss a fairway yesterday and 
i missed only two or three today i was happy with a solid round to 
get back in the tournament 
thompson also didnt play as well as he did in the first round 
the first part of my round today was an adventure until i 
settled down said thompson who had an eagle four birdies and 
three bogeys 
strange said he would like to see the wind come up because 
kemper lakes is playing too easy it is a tougher course than it

after the house ways and means committee 
finished writing the landmark 1986 tax overhaul chairman dan 
rostenkowski hung a gone fishin sign on the office door to 
dramatize that the time had come to stop changing the tax law 
the fish apparently werent biting since that time the 
committee and the counterpart senate finance committee have kept 
themselves busy adding to rolling back correcting and otherwise 
changing the new law 
there was the revenue act of 1987 about 200 changes designed 
chiefly to raise revenue for budget reduction next came the 
technical and miscellaneous revenue act of 1988 whose explanation 
alone filled a 291page book then the catastrophicillness law 
which imposed a new surtax on upperincome older americans to 
finance protection under medicare 
in the last 13 years 138 public laws have been enacted which 
changed the internal revenue code lawrence b gibbs then 
commissioner of the internal revenue service told a house panel in 
february we are seeing higher levels of anxiety born of 
frustration that comes from an inability to cope with this much 
change let us all catch our breath 
adds steve corrick of the arthur andersen accounting firm 
there is certainly a point and weve reached it where you 
ought to stop and let people at least get familiar with the law 
find out whether the rules are actually working like congress 
intended congress and the irs keep complaining about reduced 
compliance well in order to comply with the rules you have to 
know what they are 
nevertheless new law no 139 is on the way 
the 1989 tax bill being written by ways and means already 
includes more than 100 sections with many issues yet to be 
considered the 53 billion pricetag makes it sound smaller than 
it is in fact the figure simply means that the bill would raise 
taxes 53 billion more than it would cut taxes in the budget year 
that begins oct 1 
it would cut billions of dollars of taxes for many individuals 
and businesses and raise them by billions on others 
for example taxes on some lowincome working families with 
children would go down because the earnedincome tax credit would 
be liberalized the scheduled expiration of the 3 percent tax on 
local and longdistance telephone service would be canceled so 
phone users would lose an expected benefit 
taxes on defense contractors that use the completedcontract 
method of accounting would face a tax increase companies that 
increase spending for research and experimentation could continue 
claiming a tax credit that otherwise would expire this year 
the most striking aspect of the stilldeveloping bill is that it 
would roll back some recent laws that have been a major source of 
pride for taxwriters among them 
capital gains a major premise of the 1986 overhaul was that 
all income should be taxed alike meaning that capital gains 
profits from the sale of investments should lose preferential 
treatment president bush wants to restore that preference saying 
it would spur the economy and a number of democrats are willing to 
go along because such a change would boost revenues for one or two 
years and help reduce the deficit 
democratic leaders insisting a capitalgains cut would bloat 
the deficit in future years are scrambling to devise a way to 
derail a capitalgains rate reduction some type of capitalgains 
change is likely although there is general agreement it would add 
new complexity to the tax law 
catastrophic responding to complaints from upperincome 
retirees who pay most of the cost of medicare protection against 
costs of catastrophic illness the ways and means committee has 
voted to reduce benefits and shift more of the expense to older 
americans with lower incomes 
health benefits the committee has yielded to protests of 
businesses and agreed to eliminate from the 1986 law a requirement 
that employers subject their healthinsurance plans to complex 
mathematical tests to demonstrate that they do not discriminate in 
favor of workers earning more than about 50000 a year instead 
employers would simply have to show that a health plan is available 
to 90 percent of employees at a reasonable cost 
tax shelters with almost no debate the committee agreed to 
remove an antitax shelter provision enacted in 1986 the change 
would benefit only people who make more than 200000 a year and 
invest in lowincome rental housing

the desert site where up 
to 500000 people have cheered past space shuttle landings will be 
empty when columbia returns to earth closed by the air force for 
unexplained security reasons 
the department of defense said the secrecy was necessary to to 
limit an adversarys ability to determine the mission of a given 
dod shuttle flight 
air force secretary donald rice said wednesday that columbias 
crew deployed an important satellite he declined to elaborate but 
sources close to the project have said the 10ton satellite is 
designed to snap highlydetailed photographs of military targets 
over a large area of the globe including most of the soviet union 
officials declined to elaborate on how national security might 
be harmed by opening the public viewing site for columbias 
landing scheduled for 937 edt sunday 
i really dont know said don haley a civilian spokesman 
for the air force at this mojave desert military base 
the site is located 3 miles from where the shuttle rolls to a 
stop on dry lakebed runway 17 it drew 500000 spectators when 
columbia was greeted by thenpresident and mrs reagan on july 4 
1982 it has been closed during classified military shuttle 
missions 
while the public is barred reporters photographers and 
television camera operators will be allowed to watch and record 
columbias landing from a media site about 2 miles from the 
shuttles stopping point 
its crazy the air force likes to play ivegotasecret it 
makes them feel more important said john pike space policy 
analyst for the federation of american scientists 
pike said during a telephone interview from washington that he 
understands columbias payload was a modified version of the kh12 
photoreconnaissance satellite 
secrecy surrounding the shuttle is not protecting this mission 
from the russians its protecting this mission from the american 
taxpayers he said 
capt marty hauser a pentagon spokesman disagreed 
hauser said pentagon officials feel we do a good job of 
keeping the public informed through the media and congress we 
have a very effective way of reporting on the programs we have to

the agreement by central 
american presidents to disband ussupported nicaraguan rebels has 
raised hopes and added momentum to the quest for peace in the 
region after a decade of conflict 
we central american presidents have taken the destiny of 
central america in our own hands said costa rican president 
oscar arias after the accords were signed aug 7 in the honduran 
port of tela 
the presidents of costa rica nicaragua honduras el salvador 
and guatemala have committed themselves to disband the 11000 
contra rebels camped in honduras near the nicaraguan border by 
early december 
the deal was sealed after the others apparently concluded 
nicaraguas president daniel ortega was genuinely moving towards a 
fair election as he had promised so many times in the past 
although central american deadlines have not often been honored 
the end of the eightyearold nicaraguan war seems to be in sight 
the presidents widened the spotlight to include el salvador the 
outlook remains problematic but the call for a ceasefire and 
democratic guarantees has provided the best opportunity in years 
for progress towards ending a conflict that began in 1980 
the bush administration said the contras should not be disbanded 
until after nicaraguas presidential vote set for feb 25 1990 
in order to keep the heat on the leftist sandinista government 
but after eight years of fighting the us position appeared 
sterile congress has been unwilling to approve military aid that 
would restore the contras as an effective force 
el salvador honduras and costa rica receive hundreds of 
millions of dollars in aid from the united states but sources at 
the talks said the central americans concluded relations would not 
be hurt by a decision to disband the contras something that 
appeared inevitable in any case 
besides nicaragua was seen as moving towards an accommodation 
with its domestic opposition just before the summit ortega 
obtained an agreement in which the opposition joined a call for the 
contras demise in return for promises of electoral reform 
the move made ortegas promises of democratization more 
credible and ortega sweetened the deal for honduras jose azcona 
hoyo by agreeing to drop a world court suit against honduras for 
abetting subversion of another government 
emilio alvarez montalvan a conservative nicaraguan politician 
attributed the eased tensions to the superpower thaw and soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachevs policy of perestroika or economic 
and political restructuring 
like the contras ortega has had to deal with reduced support 
from his allies on thursday a soviet official told costa ricas 
arias that the soviet union will ship halt arms shipments to 
nicaragua as a contributioon to the peace process 
neither side is interested in using third world conflicts to 
get at the other any more montalvan said 
guillermo ungo el salvadors most prominent leftist politician 
noted that three presidents azcona arias and vinicio cerezo of 
guatemala are near the ends of their terms 
they wanted to go down on the record as having achieved 
something concretely positive for regional peace said ungo who 
finished a poor third to president alfredo cristiani in el 
salvadors voting earlier this year 
ungo predicted washington will continue trying to block 
implementation of the tela accords but president bush will face 
a fight in congress if he tries to extend even nonlethal aid to 
the contras in the face of central american political agreements 
the sandinistas popularity has been hurt by an economy that is 
on its way to becoming the hemispheres worst the government 
blames it on the war and a us embargo the opposition blames it 
on rigid economic policies 
even so the sandinistas are still favored in 1990 and ortega 
has improved his odds by suspending the draft with the contras 
fading the political benefits outweighed the military need 
although occasional fighting continues in the countryside 
the sandinistas also have agreed to free certain political 
prisoners reopen a television channel for the opposition allow 
united nations election observers and yield power immediately if 
the opposition wins 
once the rebels are disbanded the tela accord calls for a 
wideranging unconditional amnesty the contra leadership has been 
reported divided over whether to return to nicaragua some fear the 
fighters themselves largely poor agricultural workers will not 
want to lay down their arms 
while the opposition is looking for more concessions the 
business of politics has begun to pick up steam in nicaragua 
the supreme electoral council estimates 18 million nicaraguans 
will register the opposition newspaper la prensa expressed concern 
about fraud but added the sandinistas have absolutely renounced 
their historic project which involved holding on to power in 
order to install a dictatorship 
the tela accords in addition to demobilization of the contras 
call for an end to the salvadoran war and incorporation of the 
rebels into the democratic process 
both the government and the rebels hailed the accords and see 
improved chances for discussing peace although there was no 
requirement and no verification or enforcement provision as there 
is at the nicaraguan end 
the consensus among salvadoran politicians is that resolution of 
the contra question in and of itself benefits el salvador by 
giving it attention previously monopolized by nicaragua 
ortega agreed not to aid the rebels but salvadorans remain 
skeptical about that 
although the two sides are far apart the war has been going on 
for even longer than nicaraguas without a decisive outcome mere 
fatigue may be enough to push the sides into taking advantage of 
the tela opening

for 10 years gilbert ridley and his wife were 
the only blacks in their presbyterian church in bucks county pa 
now ridley drives 15 miles every sunday to a small allblack 
church he attended years ago 
when youre black your life experience makes you want a 
little different format he says 
so did the rev george a stallings jr a black priest who has 
been suspended by the roman catholic church for forming the imani 
temple a breakaway black congregation in washington 
unlike stallings and his followers ridley and other blacks 
interviewed at the national urban leagues annual conference are 
not breaking away from their mostly protestant churches 
but their sympathies are with stallings who was suspended by 
the washington archdiocese after he said mass in defiance of 
cardinal james a hickey on july 2 stallings says the catholic 
church has failed its nearly 2 million black parishioners he has 
accused the church of racism 
we are excited to see him have such a following because i 
want to see people go back to church ridley said in an interview 
john e jacob president of the urban league told reporters 
i believe it would be in the catholic churchs interest to 
understand what father stallings is saying 
if they see the african american community as important for 
inclusion in the church then they have to have an appeal to that 
community jacob said in a news conference wednesday as the 
fourday meeting ended they have to understand that they are in 
competition with traditional black churches 
blacks and church officials agreed that mainline protestant 
churches have avoided the imani temple type of schism by allowing 
flexibility to local congregations 
i think most protestant churches are far ahead of the catholic 
church in terms of ritual said the rev joseph e lowery 
president of the southern christian leadership conference and 
pastor of the cascade united methodist church in atlanta 
local churches are free to use the guidelines just as 
guidelines lowery said for years he said he has used the 
hymn lift every voice and sing a black favorite as the 
doxology in place of the traditional praise god from whom all 
blessings flow 
leonard benton president of the urban league in oklahoma city 
and a lutheran said concerns of blacks and minorities were a major 
issue in the merger of the american lutheran church the 
association of evangelical lutheran churches and the lutheran 
church in america to form the evangelical lutheran church in 
america effective last year 
alice e carter director of education for the pittsburgh urban 
league and wife of a lutheran minister said the lutheran church 
with its german and scandinavian underpinnings has been ethnic 
ever since it was formed 
but she said it is paying more attention to minorities at 
least in words and in policy if this can be implemented that will 
be fine the issue known in the church as inclusiveness and 
diversity is expected to be debated again when the churchs 
national assembly meets in chicago aug 2330 
mim woolbert a spokeswoman at the churchs headquarters in 
chicago said as far as worship concerns i think that is 
getting to be answered in each local congregation in a different 
way depending on the situation 
at the national office of the united methodist church in 
louisville ky marj carpenter director of news services said 
we can look back at pictures of our general assemblies even 30 
years ago and it will be all white males sitting there now the 
moderator or titular head of the church is a black woman the 
rev joan samsoncampbell of philadelphia 
still ms carpenter said blacks monitor us very closely 
they call our hands quickly if we are not paying attention to their 
concerns 
dean f dale a delegate from the louisville urban league who 
described herself as a lifelong baptist said i dont think 
there is a trend to set up separate churches and that sort of thing 
because i dont think that would solve anything i think its 
just a matter of people coming together and talking through their 
differences 
at the same time she said she could understand the frustration 
that led stallings to form the breakaway church 
ridley minority affairs coordinator for bucks county community 
college in newtown pa said he was not unhappy at the nearly 
allwhite church that he and his wife attended where he had held a 
number of church offices but felt he could be more useful by 
rejoining the allblack congregation he said the pastor of the 
larger church supported his decision to resign and be our 
missionary to the smaller congregation 
in his new church he said he is rediscovering the emotional 
climate of black worship 
i have contact again with the old black matriarchs he said 
they are beautiful they are something you miss and the kids 
they do their bit in the service tears come into your eyes when 
you see them in their blue pants and blue skirts and white shirts 
they read the scripture they do everything i had gotten away from 
all that 
in a black church you have to be very very basic he said 
black folks have to feel it and if you dont make it so you can 
feel it you get bored so you say why go

in the dusty flyridden food bazaars 
of kabul astute merchants check to see if roads are open or if 
moslem rebels have closed them before setting the price of rice 
flour and other staples 
during the past month the logar road the main route to 
transport grain and produce from pakistan has been closed the 
other key road to pakistan which runs southeast through the city 
of jalalabad has been closed intermittently though the government 
has gotten convoys through guerrilla lines under military escort 
for most of the 225 million afghans living in this milehigh 
capital and facing almost daily rocket attacks by the rebels the 
result of the road closures has been a sharp increase in prices on 
the open market especially for flour used to make the traditional 
afghan flat bread called nan 
people are not happy said gul mohammad a bearded trader 
selling 7pound sacks of flour at a market in western kabul they 
are very hungry now because food is too expensive 
the usbacked guerrillas who are based in pakistan say 
soaring prices are exactly what they want 
abdul sera of the fundamentalist hezbeislami khalist group 
said the guerrilla strategy is to put pressure on the capital and 
force residents to evacuate thus paving the way for attacks on the 
city and the ouster of the sovietsupported government of president 
najib 
we want to make it so expensive that people leave kabul 
sera told the associated press in islamabad pakistan they are 
facing a big shortage of food 
burhanuddin rabbani leader of the fundamentalist 
jamiateislami group said rebel factions must develop a 
coordinated plan to cut all roads around kabul in order to conquer 
the city 
we must have total blockage he told a western journalist 
last week in peshawar pakistan 
an average afghan worker earns about 3500 afghanis a month now 
worth less than 10 un officials estimate prices have gone up 
200 percent since jan 1 
the closure of the logar road has made things worse the price 
of a 7pound sack of flour in kabul has risen from 172 on july 4 
to 243 last week 27 percent of a typical workers monthly 
salary meanwhile the cost of one nan has jumped from 1 cents to 
36 cents 
un sources say that in recent weeks they have seen many kabul 
residents migrating north where there are fewer rocket attacks and 
food is more plentiful and cheaper 
i can say all people are facing malnutrition all they have is 
one piece of bread and tea three times a day said mohammad shah 
a 33yearold academic i dont know how we survive if the 
roads are blocked we will die of hunger 
on a recent weekend more than 100 trucks were lined up outside 
kabuls main silo waiting to unload grain but it was not for 
immediate consumption the government is replenishing its grain 
reserves to avoid a repetition of last winters severe shortages 
this grain shipment from the soviet union was transported down 
the salang highway without apparent difficulty 
brian stockwell of the world food program said the afghan 
government has reported the silo now holds about 20000 metric tons 
of grain up from just under 8000 metric tons two weeks ago a 
metric ton is equivalent to 2205 pounds or 11 short tons 
while the silo has a capacity of 50000 tons the ministry of 
light industry and food has said it can stockpile only about 40000 
tons for the winter stockwell said 
that amount represents less than half the estimated 90000 to 
100000 tons needed to get kabul through the three worst winter 
months he said 
it isnt clear yet where the rest will come from possibly the 
united nations or the soviets negotiations with the soviets are 
under way in moscow and geneva stockwell said 
in the past week the silo has been a prime target of rocket 
attacks many missed but on one day a rocket shattered windows 
and caused other minor damage 
meanwhile kabuls residents remain preoccupied with finding 
enough to eat 
shah said he couldnt afford rice a 7pound sack now costs 
462 a little less than half his monthly salary of 1025 
the biggest worry however is flour 
an afghan will be hungry unless he gets three nans every 
day said a western relief expert this is the mainstay of the 
afghan diet

a man confessed he drove the family car 
into the detroit river drowning his four children to get rid of 
his present burden a detective testified at a court hearing 
about 500 people gathered at a suburban detroit church this 
morning to pay their last respects to the four delisle children 
brian 8 melissa 4 kadie 2 and emily 10 months 
their father lawrence delisle a 28yearold tire store 
manager was ordered held without bond friday on four counts of 
firstdegree murder and one of attempted murder 
the rev walter ptak assistant pastor at st alfred roman 
catholic church in taylor told mourners that losing the children 
was painful for the community as well as the family 
this tragedy touched us in a very profound way as death has 
come so unnaturally and snatched from us these four children 
ptak said at the memorial service 
delisle and his wife suzanne 32 residents of the nearby 
detroit suburb of lincoln park escaped from the sinking station 
wagon in which delisles father committed suicide 18 months earlier 
the suspect first said a leg cramp caused him to jam the 
accelerator pedal powering the car through a barricade and into 
the river but on thursday he admitted the crash was deliberate 
said detective sgt daniel galeski 
galeski testified that delisle told him he deliberately drove 
into the river with the intent of getting rid of his present 
burden with the intent of getting rid of his wife and children 
when the detective finished testifying delisle briefly 
exchanged smiles with him 
delisle remained silent during the 10minute hearing 
twentyseventh district judge lawrence emmert ordered him held 
without bond until another court appearance next thursday 
firstdegree murder carries an automatic sentence of life in 
prison without possibility of parole attempted murder has a 
maximum sentence of life in prison 
after the hearing delisles uncle william delisle said he 
believes his nephew is innocent 
the uncle said he spoke with his nephew just before fridays 
arraignment and the younger man repeated his claim the crash was 
accidental 
he told me he did not do this thing on purpose the uncle 
said he did not want to kill his wife he did not want to kill 
his babies i stand by what he said 
i looked in the boys eyes he couldnt have done it 
he said his nephew asked how his wife was doing and told him to 
tell her i love her 
mrs delisle was not among about half a dozen family members in 
the courtroom 
the uncle said his nephew appeared to be mentally unbalanced and 
unaware of his surroundings on friday police told him his nephew 
would undergo psychiatric examination he said 
earlier this week the uncle disclosed that delisles father 
richard delisle shot himself to death in the same car 18 months 
ago 
several family members tried to persuade delisle to get rid of 
the car but his uncle said he urged his nephew to keep it because 
he needed the car and he didnt have a lot of money 
everybodys going to say its a jinxed car and we should have 
gotten rid of it in the first place the uncle said but the 
car didnt do this again

in what could be a sad epilogue to a tragic 
love story the balcony from which juliet pledged her love to romeo 
appears to be falling apart 
newspapers reported saturday that city authorities declared the 
balcony dangerous and closed off an area underneath it after some 
tourists were hit by falling pieces of wood and rock apparently 
broken loose by recent heavy rainfalls 
lanfranco franzoni director of veronas museums has said 
only a radical intervention can prevent the total collapse of 
the balcony 
city officials canceled a performance of romeo and juliet at 
the site friday night because of the precarious condition of the 
balcony after another examination of the balcony on saturday they 
decided the production could continue it closes for the season on 
tuesday night 
alessandro borsatti a member of the acting company said some 
changes had been made in the performance because of the damage but 
the balcony was still considered safe for the actress who plays 
juliet 
however he said instead of escaping from the balcony romeo 
now will flee from an adjacent window 
the balcony in verona is a place of pilgrimage for shakespeare 
fans and for romantic souls 
juliets house a 13thcentury building in the center of 
town used to be an inn called il cappello or the hat in 
italian its name sounded close enough to juliets family name 
capulet to identify it as the setting of shakespeares play 
stefania corliano a guide at the house said the citys 
architect supervised a group of masons saturday who made minor 
repairs to the balcony she said the architect decided major 
repairs could wait until the fall 
newspapers reported that time and weather were not alone in 
causing decay of the balcony many of the 200000 visitors who come 
yearly to verona to remember romeo and juliet try to break off a 
piece as a souvenir for their beloved

residents and officials frustrated by a 
juvenile justice system they view as ineffective are welcoming an 
ordinance threatening parents with two days in a stockade if their 
children are caught out at night 
i know what motivates people said city attorney charles 
sidney gibson they want public approval we sanitized crime and 
punishment so much that we have removed the shame people need to 
see what happens when you dont conform to the law 
the city council passed the ordinance aug 5 after a fight early 
that day involving five people some wielding broken bottles and 
about 250 onlookers the ordinance calls for a written warning to 
parents the first time a minor is found violating the new 11 pm 
to 530 am curfew the second time the ordinance says they can 
be fined up to 500 and jailed 30 days including up to two days 
on public display in a stockade and have their picture run in the 
local newspaper with the caption irresponsible parent 
there are snags the paper says it hasnt decided whether to run 
such pictures the ordinance does not specify what it means by a 
stockade the town doesnt have one and the council didnt vote to 
build one 
supporters of the ordinance include mike brannon owner of the 
dermott pawn shop though his business sits across the street from 
the police department in this southeastern arkansas community of 
4500 his front windows are protected with an iron grid after 
several breakins 
how about this for a stockade brannon said from behind the 
grid 
he said the legal system doesnt deal effectively with juveniles 
theres not a whole lot you can do about them brannon said 
its gotten to the point where theres no embarrassment or other 
problems for them 
the juveniles arrested for breaking his windows and taking 
merchandise were ordered to reimburse him but havent yet he said 
police chief jerry melton said that when hes had parents and 
children in for conferences other children waiting outside 
sometimes have yelled dont tell them nothing they cant send 
us to jail 
the towns crime rate has tripled this summer mostly because of 
juvenile troublemakers he said 
melton who heads a sevenofficer police force said the 
ordinance already has shown its effectiveness 
he said a parent who received a first warning told the chief to 
expect a child abuse call telling him im going to whip this 
child im not going to jail for him 
melton acknowledged that many of the children committing crimes 
come from broken homes and are left alone by parents who must work 
but he added its good theyve got a job but it doesnt release 
them from the responsibility of being a parent 
whether or not sentencing parents to public display is 
effective it is clearly unconstitutional according to jay 
jacobson executive director of the arkansas chapter of the 
american civil liberties union 
jacobson said he was sure someone would challenge the ordinance 
in court and theres no way itll stand up 
gibson disagreed saying the us supreme court has ruled that 
the constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishment is a 
changing concept 
james lee of the state attorney generals office said the 
penalties outlined in the dermott ordinance are unprecedented but 
that the idea behind them isnt 
we have a parental liability law lee said every state 
does when a juvenile or incompetent person causes some sort of 
damage the responsibility is transferred to the parent or 
guardian 
emma ware one of three parents cited under the new ordinance 
said she supports it her 9yearold son was caught bringing a gun 
to a fight between three 13yearold girls 
the law aint strict enough on the gangs and drugs and 
things she said 
we had to do something to get tough said toni scucchi a 
teacher at dermott elementary i agree with it it may sound 
outlandish but nothing has worked so far 
dedgra griffin 20 believes the answer is to punish the 
wrongdoers not the parents 
most of them have been in trouble before if i were their 
parents i would let them take them away she said lock the 
kids up

the chinese governments campaign to distort 
the truth about the tiananmen square massacre may seem futile but 
even eyewitnesses could one day believe they recall the fabricated 
history a memory expert says 
all the right psychological hightech ingredients are in place 
for the lie to become truth reason enough for us to be pessimistic 
about the future of memories of tiananmen square said elizabeth 
loftus 
the chinese government is not the first set of leaders to try 
to rewrite history their attempts at mental manipulation are only 
the most radical in recent times 
we should not be complacent in thinking they cant succeed 
rather we should worry about whose memory is next she said 
loftus of the university of washington in seattle cited 
research into manipulation of eyewitness memories in an address 
friday at the annual meeting of the american psychological 
association 
chinese authorities have been using memorymodifying techniques 
to convince citizens that violence in the armys june 4 attack on 
prodemocracy demonstrators was caused by rowdy civilian thugs she 
said 
the tactics include repeated television images of soldiers being 
attacked she said workers students bureaucrats and party 
members are exposed to twiceweekly seminars on the topic and 
make public pledges of allegiance to the party line she said 
people are particularly prone to having their memories 
modified when the passage of time allows the original memory to 
fade loftus said 
in its weakened condition memory like the diseaseridden 
body becomes especially vulnerable to repeated assaults on its 
very essence we are especially susceptible if we can be induced 
to repeat the misinformation as fact 
the experiments in memory modification loftus cited generally 
shared a common strategy people witnessed a crime accident or 
other incident typically on film sometime later they were tested 
on their recall of the event 
but some of the people were slipped fictitious details without 
their realizing it and they later recalled them as memory 
in one experiment subjects watched a film of an accident on a 
country road later they were asked if they had seen a barn which 
in fact did not appear in the film 
researchers planted that idea of a barn in the minds of some 
subjects by asking how fast was the white sports car going when 
it passed the barn 
of the people who were asked that question 17 percent later 
declared they had seen a barn only about 3 percent of people who 
had not been exposed to the leading question later said the film 
had included a barn 
in another experiment up to 80 percent of misled witnesses 
recalled planted information 
people can be quite confident that they are truly remembering 
planted details loftus said 
people have recalled nonexistent broken glass and tape 
recorders a cleanshaven man as having a mustache straight hair 
as curly she said 
in an interview she acknowledged that the degree of memory 
distortion achieved by such experiments is far less ambitious than 
the goals she described for the chinese government 
but the chinese leaders have advantages over experimenters like 
herself she said 
they have forever to do it she said i have only one 
hour they have the resources and the opportunity to just hammer 
away at this in ways we havent even begun to try in experiments 
we present information once or twice and people grab onto it 
they can wait and let memories fade for a year whats left except 
this germ of a recollection into which you can insert new 
ideas 
not everyone in her audience agreed with loftus about the 
chinese governments ability to alter memories 
im not as pessimistic about the eyewitnesses said sam 
glucksberg a psychology professor at princeton university 
a person who was right next to a person who was shot i dont 
think his memory of that can be significantly altered glucksberg 
said i dont think you can convince him he did not see that 
glucksberg said the impact on memory loftus described are real 
but that nobody knows how much memories can be changed

robin higgins in a moving salute to her 
husband last week spoke of the virtual certainty hed been 
killed at the hands of his lebanese terrorist kidnappers 
mrs higgins made the announcement nearly 18 months after lt 
col william higgins was taken captive and following an exhaustive 
fbi study of a videotape released by his kidnappers which 
purported to show higgins body bound and gagged and hanging from 
a makeshift gallows 
but no corpse was made available to us officials and a un 
official who traveled to beirut to search for the body returned 
emptyhanded so it appears a formal declaration of death could be 
some time coming 
the problem is a familiar one to other us military families 
who struggled with uncertainty regarding the fate of their loved 
ones 
since world war i the pentagon lists approximately 92000 
troops as missing in action much attention has been focused 
recently on the 2344 military personnel still unaccounted for from 
the vietnam war 
its a very difficult problem to deal with emotionally and 
legally said betsy cox spokeswoman for the national league of 
families of american prisoners and missing in southeast asia 
this is a particularly tragic situation it looks like col 
higgins was killed but theres still that degree of doubt said 
ms cox 
the spokeswoman said mrs higgins herself a marine major 
appeared at a recent event and sponsored by her organization and 
attended by defense secretary dick cheney 
maj higgins has been very supportive of our group throughout 
her ordeal i can see where she would gain some comfort from 
being with powmia prisoner of war missing in action families 
ms cox said 
even when there is a formal declaration of death of a loved one 
who has been missing sometimes family members cling to the chance 
a mistake has been made said carmella laspada a spokeswoman for a 
no greater love a support organization for families of missing 
soldiers 
hope is a cheater if no one knows for sure its always very 
distressing for the family she said 
lt col fred peck a marine corps spokesman said the decision 
to declare a serviceman or woman dead is up to the service 
secretary in higgins case it has been delegated to gen alfred 
m gray the commandant of the marine corps 
gray has taken a close personal interest in the case and 
has taken robin under his wing said peck 
but before making any decision gray has indicated more work 
needs to be done peck said 
the commandant who personally informed mrs higgins of the gist 
of the fbis report has asked to see the bureaus complete written 
study and has requested a personal briefing as well 
gray intends to speak with the un official who traveled in 
search of higgins body marrack goulding and also meet with the 
marine corps lawyers about the case 
he also intends to speak with robin again there is nothing 
compelling him to arrive at a decision at any specified time 
peck said 
no plans have been made for any memorial service he added 
we really dont know when the situation will change 
bascially its openended for now peck said 
there is a formal process under which a formal declaration of 
death is made and the families concerned are invited to participate 
in or contest the process peck said 
each is handled on a casebycase basis he said 
up until a declaration is made the surviving spouse continues 
to draw the full pay and allowances due the serviceman or woman 
when the declaration is made the pay stops and the account is 
settled peck said 
that includes such things as life insurance payments most 
servicemen carry the 50000 group life insurance policy that 
higgins had payment for any leave accrued and payment of 
survivors benefits of approximately 1000 a month for life 
unless the spouse decides to remarry peck said 
mrs higgins hasnt ever mentioned the financial aspects of her 
husbandssituation the spokesman said 
thats been the least of her worries he said

on a monday morning when most people were 
returning to work the rev floyd rose and his supporters gathered 
at the ottawa river to remember a 16yearold black teenager who 
drowned in the muddy water 
he did not have to die rose pastor of the family baptist 
church said after robert thomas mother diane placed a wreath in 
the water where her son died his death has sparked a new wave of 
civil rights demonstrations in this northwestern ohio city 
thomas who was described as afraid of water drowned july 26 
after he jumped into the river while being chased by a white 
university of toledo police officer 
the prayer vigil aug 7 attracted 100 people who were outraged 
because there was about an hours delay before fire division water 
rescue workers were contacted to begin a search for the boy 
rose the most visible of toledos civil rights leaders 
promises to keep the pressure on city officials until questions 
surrounding the boys death are answered police and fire officials 
say proper procedures were followed but refuse to comment further 
while the investigation is pending 
the city always takes the africanamerican community for 
fools rose said had they told us that there was a breakdown 
in communication by the police and fire departments and apologized 
for the error we would have understood 
but the city never apologized to anyone instead they said 
everyone followed proper procedures and tried to say robert was a 
criminal even though he wasnt charged with anything instead of 
being conciliatory they have been arrogant 
weve backed down before but not this time 
about 17 percent of the citys 340000 residents are black 
city leaders led by mayor donna owens have tried to meet with 
rose and several other key activists to defuse the unrest but 
those efforts have been rebuffed 
every time the city wants something from us they call a 
meeting rose said but when we try to discuss problems facing 
the city our concerns they claim were being unreasonable 
ms owens said the point of meeting is to move beyond rhetoric 
and start dealing with issues 
i think its time that rose and everyone else starts 
considering the safety and concerns of all of our citizens in this 
community and that we work together in building positive 
relationships she said 
since the early 1970s an advocacy group has been monitoring the 
hiring practices of the citys police and fire departments which 
are under federal court order to hire more minorities 
racial tensions flared in june 1988 after city manager philip 
hawkey who is white dismissed one black official and suspended 
two other blacks he accused of mismanaging the citys housing 
programs 
after public hearings late last year the ohio civil rights 
commission and the city signed an agreement july 28 that toledo 
will hire and promote more minorities and women a report on 
toledos race relations is pending from the ohio advisory committee 
to the us civil rights commission also as a result of those 
hearings 
in march controversy over sexist and racist remarks allegedly 
made by fire chief william winkle brought many white leaders into 
the movement 
winkle was suspended for 20 days for making a sexist remark 
about a female city employee later the city released a 1982 
report that said firefighters heard winkle praise adolf hitler and 
support lynching blacks 
winkle rarely talks publicly about the allegations which he has 
denied he did not return a telephone message last week seeking 
additional comment 
a lot of the prejudice is intangible rose said the kind 
of prejudice in toledo isnt like the segregation in the south 
many people in the white community couldnt put their fingers on 
why we felt the way we did then they saw winkle his attitude and 
the citys unwillingness to take any action now they know 
thomas drowning opened new wounds authorities say he jumped 
into the river to elude officers pursuing him and three others 
suspected of trying to steal several cases of soda from a 
convenience store near the university of toledo the other suspects 
were not apprehended 
rose said if thomas had been white rescuers would have been 
sent much sooner 
the fbi is investigating whether thomas civil rights were 
violated before he jumped in the rainswollen river 
hawkey said a report on the incident should be complete soon he 
said police and fire personnel followed procedures 
councilman jack ford who is black said the drowning made more 
people aware of racial tension in the city 
i suspect the death of the young man not only has brought 
concern in the black community but in the greater community he 
said i think theres going to be some deep changes that have to 
be made very quickly for it to be turned around

supported by us helicopters and 
more manpower searchers stepped up the hunt saturday for rep 
mickey leland and his delegation but a fifth day passed with no 
sign of the partys downed plane 
four us army blackhawk helicopters joined the growing fleet of 
american and ethiopian aircraft looking for leland dtexas and 15 
others missing since monday when their twinengine airplane 
disappeared on a flight to a refugee camp 
the blackhawks ferried across the atlantic from eglin air force 
base in florida by a c5 cargo plane were assembled in addis ababa 
on friday and took to the air at dawn joining more than a dozen 
other aircraft 
john guerra spokesman for the us embassy in addis ababa said 
three more c130 hercules cargo planes were to arrive sunday 
supplementing two already taking part in the search that began 
tuesday 
the helicopters were dispatched to ethiopia before lelands 
press secretary in washington criticized the search effort friday 
as lacking a sense of urgency 
theres an obvious leadership or organizational vacuum here 
lelands spokeswoman alma newsom told a news conference we 
could have and should have located them by now 
but weary officials in ethiopias capital defended their efforts 
we feel we have adequate resources said guerra however 
if the requirements of the operation increase we are prepared to 
increase both the equipment and the manpower 
the twinengine twin otter disappeared monday on a flight from 
addis ababa to the fugnido refugee camp 480 miles to the southwest 
near the sudanese border leland chairman of the house select 
committee on hunger was one of nine americans aboard the flight 
earlier this week weather satellites detected what appeared to 
be distress signals from aircraft in two areas outside the leland 
planes intended flight path but nothing was found when rescuers 
searched those areas 
the c130s due to arrive sunday were bringing crews to spell the 
fliers of the first two hercules who have been in the air from 
sunup to sundown each day since their arrival on an overnight 
flight from west germany on tuesday 
guerra described as superb the cooperation of the 
ethiopians with whom the united states has had chilly relations 
since a marxist government came to power in a 1974 coup 
the ethiopians have put up to 10 aircraft up in a day he 
said you got a heck of a lot of people out there looking for the 
missing aircraft weve got the local authorities also helping on 
the ground 
the government in addis ababa has allowed an american u2 a 
highaltitude reconnaisance craft commonly used for spy missions 
to make daily passes over its territory taking highresolution 
photographs of the search area 
i think there is an honest difference of opinion among people 
equally committed to finding the aircraft said james haley the 
embassys chief spokesman rescue people here are deciding on 
what they consider adequate resources 
two of lelands colleagues reps gary ackerman and al wheat 
flew in the fleet of four blackhawks that spent the day scouring 
the first 100 miles of the intended flight path of downed plane 
the two c130s and a number of ethiopian planes covered the 
remainder of the path 
ackerman a member of lelands committee and wheat who belongs 
to the congressional black caucus were sent to ethiopia by house 
speaker thomas s foley to represent the lower chamber 
leland has made six trips to ethiopia the last one just last 
march as chairman of the select committee he long has expressed 
intense interest in the problems of africas displaced and hungry 
the fugnido camp is one of four camps in southwestern ethiopia 
run by the un high commissioner for refugees it houses more than 
300000 sudanese who have fled famine and civil war in their 
neighboring country 
the eight other americans traveling with leland included three 
members of his staff a friend of the congressman three officers 
from the us agency for international development and the spouse 
of one of the aid officials also aboard were an ethiopian employee 
of the us embassy three ethiopian officials and a crew of three

prime minister czeslaw kiszczak whose 
efforts to form a cabinet have been opposed by solidarity called 
saturday for a meeting with lech walesa to discuss the standoff and 
the concerns it has raised in the soviet union 
in an interview published by the official pap news agency 
kiszczak said poland simply cannot afford a protracted impasse 
kiszczak also said two small communistaligned political parties 
that have entered into negotiations with officials of the 
solidarity movement should remain loyal to the communist party 
kiszczaks public appeal for a meeting appeared to indicate a 
decision by communist authorities that the time has come to end the 
political jockeying and hammer out an agreement with solidarity on 
the form of the next government 
walesa announced monday he would oppose any cabinet assembled by 
kiszczak the solidarity leader has been trying to forge alliances 
with the two minor parties who hold the parliamentary power 
balance in order to form a solidarityled government in the soviet 
unions largest east bloc ally 
talks between solidarity and the minor parties the united 
peasants and the democrats began thursday 
a spokesman for walesa janusz paczek said saturday he was not 
sure if walesa was aware of kiszczaks call for a meeting walesa 
was unavailable for comment and paczek said no meeting would take 
place before monday 
in the year since communist authorities resumed dialogue with 
solidarity meetings between walesa and kiszczak at various 
government villas around warsaw were the scene of key compromises 
such meetings took place before and during the round table 
talks that led to legalizing the union rewriting the constitution 
and admitting the opposition to parliament 
given the oppositions overwhelming victories in june elections 
both opposition and communist politicians have argued that 
solidaritys endorsement is required for the next government to 
have public support 
the soviet union has expressed impatience with the political 
situation and the soviet ambassador to poland met friday with 
kiszczak and with united peasant chairman roman malinowski and 
democratic chairman jerzy jozwiak 
the discussions with the party chairmen pap said concerned the 
progress of reforms and establishing direct links between the minor 
parties and the communist party of the soviet union 
a soviet foreign ministry official in moscow on friday 
criticized attempts to use the formation of the polish government 
for destabilizing the situation in the country according to 
the tass news agency 
the official first deputy vadim perfiliev did not mention 
solidarity by name but the polish communist party leadership also 
has referred to walesas bid as destabilizing 
perfiliev said that any attempts to undermine the countrys 
stability and willingness to carry out its agreements under the 
warsaw pact military alliance would not promote the interests of 
stability in europe 
in the interview kiszczak was asked about walesas bid to form 
a government in place of him 
i would not treat the failure of kiszczaks mission as a 
personal tragedy he said however this is not exclusively my 
personal matter that is why i would not be able to neglect the 
effects of a government crisis 
he said he has been unable to arrange substantive talks with 
walesa since being named prime minister aug 2 i would like such 
a talk to take place as soon as possible he said 
kiszczak said the peasant and democratic parties owe loyalty to 
his communist polish united workers party 
in politics delivering on agreements and loyalty should be 
values that are respected kiszczak said the political 
contract reached at the round table guaranteed the vital 
political interests of the two parties 
noting the peasants and the democrats owe the number of seats 
they have in parliament to a deal made with the communist party 
and that the parties entered elections as communist allies he 
said i think this obliges one 
kiszczak who said he hopes to present his cabinet for approval 
by the parliament in late august stressed he has not given up on 
the idea of forming a government that would have both the 
opposition and communists in it 
unfortunately he said solidarity lawmakers reject direct 
participation in the government 
but he added i am not giving up hope that the supreme reasons 
will prevail after all and a chance will surface for the formation 
of agovernment of national agreement the offer still stands

the columbia astronauts tested the 
shuttles flight control systems on their last full day in orbit as 
they prepared to end their secret military mission with a morning 
landing sunday in a california desert 
nasa briefly broke a pentagonimposed news blackout saturday to 
announce that columbia would land at edwards air force base 
calif at 937 am edt the space agency previously had said only 
that the shuttle would land sometime between 9 am and noon sunday 
the crew is doing well and is beginning landing 
preparations a nasa statement said the announcement was one of 
just a few made this week about the semisecret mission 
sundays weather forecast called for excellent landing 
conditions at edwards skies were to be partly cloudy and 
temperatures were expected to range from 68 degrees just after 
sunrise to a midday high of 97 degrees 
although hundreds of thousands of people have flocked to the air 
force base to watch previous shuttles land in the mojave desert 
sundays touchdown will be closed to the public because of the 
classified nature of the flight 
the planned private landing was a fitting finale to the flight 
which has been cloaked in secrecy from the start the news blackout 
was imposed by the department of defense which wants to keep the 
missions activities a secret 
to prepare for the trip back to earth columbia commander 
brewster shaw and pilot richard richards were running through a 
series of tests saturday to make certain the shuttles computers 
and control jets were ready 
in addition mission specialists david leestma james adamson 
and mark brown were packing up the experiments some of those tests 
were believed to be connected with the star wars missile 
defense project while others involved determining how people can 
serve as military observers from space 
during their mission the five military men also reportedly 
monitored military tactical and strategic targets on earth 
the main goal of the flight was widely believed to be the 
deployment of a sophisticated 10ton spy satellite that is 
designed to snap highly detailed photographs over a wide area of 
the globe including most of the soviet union 
air force secretary donald rice confirmed wednesday that a 
satellite was deployed by the astronauts during their first day in 
orbit but he wouldnt discuss its purpose

oliver tambo president of the african national 
congress suffered a stroke in zambia and was flown to london for 
treatment sources in the organization were quoted as saying 
saturday 
a spokesman for the british company lonrho plc said tambo was 
flown to london on a company plane but would not say which hospital 
was treating the 71yearold black nationalist leader or describe 
his condition 
press association the british domestic news agency quoted 
sources in the african national congress as saying tambo was 
stricken wednesday and flown to london friday for treatment at a 
private hospital 
they were quoted as saying he was absent during a summit in 
zambia thursday involving the presidents of angola botswana 
mozambique tanzania zambia and zimbabwe and leaders of the anc 
the largest guerrilla organization fighting the whiterun 
government in south africa 
the british foreign office could not immediately confirm the 
report 
the lonrho spokesman speaking anonymously said the aircraft 
had been in lusaka for another reason and that action had been 
taken to help tambo after a request from african governments 
the lonhro spokesman said he did not know how long tambo would 
be in britain or whether the company would provide him with a 
flight back to zambia 
of the decision to use the lonhro plane he said 
there was no hesitation it was a matter of some considerable 
concern that he should be got back to britain as soon as possible 
the plane was coming in this direction anyway 
tambo leader of the anc since 1967 has been in exile since 
south africa banned the organization in 1960 
his longtime friend and jailed former anc partner nelson mandela 
said in a note from prison in 1985 oliver tambo is much more 
than a brother to me he is my greatest friend and comrade for 
nearly 50 years 
tambo is believed to command wide respect from others in the 
ancs exiled leadership but there are persistent reports that two 
factions will vie for power once he is gone 
a more militant faction headed by anc military chief of staff 
chris hani has favored continuing or escalating sabotage and 
bombings in south africa including attacks on civilian targets 
the more moderate faction favoring diplomacy is led by thabo 
mbeki the ancs foreign affairs secretary who has been mentioned 
frequently as a likely successor to tambo

the flags are flying in princes 
street and the capital is bustling with the first of 250000 
visitors to the worlds biggest arts extravaganza beginning sunday 
but as the threeweek edinburgh festival of music theater and 
dance opens organizers are asking what the future holds for the 
43yearold chronically underfunded event 
a policy committee has been set up for the first time to discuss 
wider issues than what shows to put on including the festivals 
direction in the next 10 years said frank dunlop festival 
director for the last seven years 
it seems to me that unless it can be creatively expanded and 
look at itself afresh it will become moribund he said in an 
interview adding i dont think im becoming moribund although 
some might think i am 
dunlop is a short stocky graybearded englishman the son of a 
polishlatvian shoemakers daughter and a scottish engineer 
he was associate director of the national theater under laurence 
olivier founded the young vic youth theater and worked in new york 
as a successful director 
he searches constantly for unexpected delights for the festival 
including in other years a hilarious canadian comedy about old 
movies and a japanese macbeth performed in white body stockings 
this year has much that is spanish spanish opera puppets 
ballet theater and the national orchestra of spain 
dunlop said he hadnt had time to read one prominent london 
newspaper article suggesting he is ready to quit because he was 
dispirited about the future of the festival 
money is a continual problem the edinburgh festival has always 
been underfunded and the city fathers never built the opera house 
that was pledged after world war ii 
i spend more time appealing for money than anything else 
says dunlop the festival is costing 48 million this year and 
we should be spending 64 million 
festival visitors will spend at least 64 million in the next 
three weeks but the city especially its businesses is 
notoriously parsimonious he said 
local authorities and the government this year will provide 
around 2 million in subsidies and commercial sponsors give another 
800000 the rest comes from the box office advertising revenue 
and sales 
in the last month dunlop was stunned when the festival found 
itself 16000 short of the money needed to set up an exhibition 
about tartan history and fashion sponsored by a us trust fund 
not a single scottish sponsor was interested but we finally 
scraped it together he said 
still he said we know that edinburgh wants the festival 
despite the hunger of glasgow and london to kidnap it and the 
sniping from down south that edinburgh doesnt deserve it 
dunlop said in the past five years the festival has become more 
international with companies from eastern europe japan and south 
korea participating this year the festival also includes the 
houston ballet and martha clarke dance company from the united 
states 
we now must try to get the south and central americans here 
it must become a festival of innovation if it is to make 
progress he said

the countrys most influential shiite 
moslem cleric said saturday the hostage issue will move in the 
direction of a rational solution but he warned it could take a 
long time and any us military move would backfire 
sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah made his comments in an 
interview with the moslemrun radio voice of the nation a day after 
he offered to help free western hostages if western countries 
helped release arab prisoners in israel 
fadlallah is spiritual guide to the proiranian hezbollah or 
party of god the group is believed to be the umbrella organization 
for underground factions holding most of the western hostages in 
lebanon 
asked to comment on reports of a planned us military action if 
another american hostage is killed fadlallah said 
this will not achieve anything but will endanger the hostages 
for whom the war is waged and will increase the possibilities of 
what america calls terrorism 
we believe that any american military action will backfire and 
may provoke revolutionary elements opposed to the american policy 
in the region he said 
therefore the issue will move in the direction of a rational 
solution that may take a long time but it will not move at all in 
a military atmosphere at least in americas interests he added 
the united states sent warships to the eastern mediterranean and 
to waters near iran during the height of the latest hostage crisis 
the crisis developed after israel abducted a 
hezbollahaffiliated cleric sheik abdul karim obeid from south 
lebanon on july 28 israeli officials say obeid has since confessed 
to helping plan attacks on israel and to the 1988 abduction of us 
marine lt col william higgins a un peacekeeper in south 
lebanon 
the organization of the oppressed on earth claimed it hanged 
higgins on july 31 because israel refused to free obeid however 
some reports say he was killed months earlier 
another group the revolutionary justice organization said it 
would kill american hostage joseph cicippio if obeid was not 
released however it later said it had granted cicippio a 
reprieve and offered to free him if israel released obeid and 450 
arab prisoners and also let 55 palestinian deportees return to the 
occupied lands 
israel has said any swap must include three israeli soldiers 
held in lebanon 
in his remarks saturday fadlallah also accused the united 
states of prolonging the detention of the hostages 
america could have resolved this problem realistically through 
deep quiet diplomacy but instead it has worked on prolonging 
the period of their detention because it found out it could use the 
hostage issue in its war against terrorism fadlallah said 
on friday fadlallah said let us get to an agreement together 
so that each side would use his own means and influence to end the 
crisis of the hostages all hostages and resolve the problem of 
arab prisoners he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater and state department 
spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said fadlallahs statement was worth 
noting 
among the 16 western hostages in lebanon are eight americans 
four britons two west germans one irishman and one italian 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent of 
the associated press who was abducted march 16 1985

although mark twains humor is a chief 
reason for his enduring popularity several scholars meeting to 
commemorate one of the authors least humorous novels said twains 
brooding side will also help keep him relevant to future 
generations 
i think people are figuring out that they cant some day say 
well mark twain hes out of it he was just a mindless 
optimist said louis budd a duke university professor and 
editor of the journal of american literature 
people do know there was a darker and more irreverent side to 
mark twain budd said 
budd was among about 150 literary scholars and twain fans 
attending a threeday conference sponsored by elmira colleges 
center for mark twain studies at quarry farm to mark the 100th 
anniversary of the publication of a connecticut yankee in king 
arthurs court 
the conference held thursday friday and saturday in the city 
where twain is buried showed how popular the author remains 79 
years after his death 
only a few years ago academic types like myself were polled 
on who was the greatest american writer and mark twain and walt 
whitman came out no 1 said everett emerson a university of 
north carolina professor and twain biographer 
now in fact ive almost never known an ordinary person whos 
read a whole lot of walt whitman he said but twain is 
recognized by professors as a very great writer at the same time 
ordinary people do too twains different from any other american 
writer because hes liked by ordinary people 
indeed debates continued throughout the conference about the 
meaning and significance of a connecticut yankee as if the 
novel had appeared in 1989 instead of 1889 
the novel concerns an imaginary trip to 6thcentury england by 
hank morgan a connecticut factory mechanic who uses his knowledge 
of electricity and other modern technology to seize control of 
the court 
while the first third of the book is mostly a farce about the 
customs of medieval england and the inconveniences of living in 
that age the novel takes on a more ominous tone in its final 
twothirds it ends with a bloody battle in which thousands of 
knights are slaughtered with the help of such 19th century 
refinements as electricity and gatling guns 
frederick crews a university of california at berkeley 
professor said the ending of the book stuns and chills us 
only a few critics have been able to talk themselves out of 
the sense that something has gone terribly wrong not only with the 
book but also with twain he told conference participants 
many critics have seen the darkness of the latter part of a 
connecticut yankee as presaging the final two troubled decades of 
twains own life when a series of financial and personal setbacks 
prompted a string of bitter misanthropic writings budd referred 
to this stage of the authors life as the late atheistic 
outrageous twain 
still crews and most other experts at the conference agreed 
that many passages in a connecticut yankee exhibit the kind of 
homespun wit and humor twain became famous for in the adventures 
of huckleberry finn and other books 
it has the makings of a classic he said of a connecticut 
yankee 
according to emerson twains reputation has profited from the 
added attention the author has received from centennial 
celebrations of huckleberry finn in 1985 and a connecticut 
yankee this year 
you must know the worst thing that could happen to a writer is 
to be forgotten he said no one has forgotten this guy

soviet fans jumped danced and wrapped themselves 
in giant american flags saturday as some of heavy metals biggest 
stars made their soviet debut in moscows biggestever hard rock 
concert 
the benefit concert a twoday extravaganza billed as the 
moscow music peace festival and likened to the woodstock 
festival of 20 years ago features western musicians motley crue 
bon jovi scorpions cinderella ozzy osbourne and skid row as 
well as the soviet groups nuance gorky park and brigada s 
proceeds will go to programs that fight drug and alcohol abuse 
in the united states and the soviet union 
about 100000 fans filled the lenin stadium in central moscow 
saturday many of them reclining on mats or jumping and screaming 
near the stage painted in the psychedelic style of the 1960s 
some fans wrapped themselves in giant american flags and formed 
human pyramids 
were athletes we need some psychological relaxation a 
member of the soviet junior fencing team shouted after the pyramid 
he was forming with teammates toppled 
the concerts soviet organizer impressario stas namin told a 
news conference friday the concert would be as important to his 
generation as woodstock was to american youth in 1969 
we will show that rock is not just negative he said 
after so many years of stigmatization this is something 
positive 
at 16 a ticket the concert was exorbitantly priced by soviet 
standards however organizers said it quickly sold out 
this is the first time weve ever had such a concert said 
23yearold yelena viklova who came with her husband there was 
no way we could pass up the chance we came to see the foreign 
groups 
rock promoter alexei kisilev said the concert represented a 
major step forward from two years ago when soviet authorities 
banned a proposed antidrug concert because they said we didnt 
have a drug problem and our rock was not developed enough 
soviet authorities no longer emphatically condemn rock music as 
a decadent western force but officials still occasionally express 
disapproval of rock culture 
few hard rock albums are put out in the soviet union and groups 
have generally had a hard time making arrangements for concert 
halls and tours they have however gained ground under president 
mikhail s gorbachevs cultural thaw 
any parallel with woodstock the outdoor festival at a farm in 
new york state that became a symbol of the 1960s escaped many of 
saturdays fans one 18yearold muscovite asked whether woodstock 
had been held in moscow 
kisilev said the weekends concert could change the soviet rock 
scene and serve as a precedent for more such events 
one fan at the concert was us ambassador jack matlock who 
gave an impromptu press conference wearing one of the just say 
nyet buttons promoters had distributed the buttons mirrored the 
us antidrug slogan just say no 
these contacts show we have common goals and common 
problems matlock said as he posed for photos with longhaired 
rockers eric brittingham and fred courey of cinderella 
the concert will spawn an album dedicated to rock stars who died 
of overdoses american viewers will be able to see four hours of 
performances on cable television sunday organizers said

indian peacekeeping troops killed at 
least 51 civilians and set homes and shops on fire after being 
attacked by ethnic tamil rebels in a northern town tamil sources 
said saturday 
the sri lankan government which has been trying to persuade 
india to pull out its soldiers said it has begun an investigation 
into the killings 
the tamil sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
that in addition to killing the civilians the indians set fire to 
40 homes and 23 shops a rebel group claimed at least 70 civilians 
were killed but india reported 18 civilians dead 
the indian patrol was ambushed aug 2 in the town of 
velvettiturai about 200 miles north of colombo at least six 
soldiers were killed in the attack indian military officials said 
at the time 
a sri lankan defense ministry official said the investigation 
was ordered after tamil lawmakers in parliament raised the issue 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
government was considering a request that a parliamentary group be 
sent to the area to investigate 
the tamil sources quoted residents as saying the indian troops 
imposed a 48hour curfew on velvettiturai after the ambush and 
carried out search operations many houses were shelled and 
several of the civilian casualties were burned to death they said 
they said 51 victims were identified by relatives after the 
curfew was lifted the liberation tigers of tamil eelam the rebel 
group fighting the indians said in a statement telexed to 
newspaper offices from london that at least 70 civilians had been 
killed in the offensive 
however the tigers accounts of casualties have proved to be 
exaggerated in the past 
in new delhi a government spokesman said there were 18 
civilians killed in an exchange of gunfire between soldiers and 
rebels after the ambush he said 12 rebels and rebel supporters 
were killed 
the spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
rebels used civilians as a cover while firing rocketpropelled 
grenades and automatic rifles at the indian army patrol 
indian soldiers were sent to sri lankas tamildominated north 
and east two years ago to put down a tamil war for an independent 
homeland 
they were deployed initially to supervise an indiansponsored 
peace plan that called for the government to give tamils limited 
autonomy in exchange for an arms surrender however the tigers 
rejected the agreement and turned their guns on the indians 
india got involved in the ethnic problems of this nation off its 
southern coast because of the sympathies of its own 60 million 
tamils for the rebel cause 
president ranasinghe premadasa had asked india to withdraw its 
soldiers by july 29 to appease sinhalese militants who object to 
the indian presence as well as the tamil rebels india however 
said a quick withdrawal could lead to more violence 
india has instead said it will withdraw its more than 40000 
soldiers in phases it says they will all be out by february 
tamils form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million people they 
say they suffer discrimination by the sinhalese who make up 75 
percent of the population and control the government 
militant tamils launched their separatist war in 1983 at least 
11000 people including 1000 indian soldiers have been killed 
since then

a classified section of the soontobe 
released national drug strategy calls for an expansion of us 
military training for local forces in three south american 
countries and allocates 300 million for antidrug efforts an 
administration source says 
given that they now receive pocket change it could be a 
tripling of us expenditures for the worlds largest 
cocaineproducing countries peru bolivia and colombia said the 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the united states already provides some military training of 
local forces in bolivia but not to peru or colombia 
president bush in campaign speeches called for stepped up 
actions against drugs at their south american origins but such 
attempts have been largely unsuccessful because of guerrilla wars 
economic problems and a lack of resources 
the administration official stressed that the proposal calls for 
more training of troops not for actual military operations by 
american forces also the local governments would have to request 
the presence of us armed forces overseas 
theres nothing unilateral contemplated the source said 
the proposal is in a classified section of the drug strategy 
drafted by national drug policy director william j bennett the 
national security council is reviewing all international and 
interdiction proposals president bush is scheduled to present the 
final package to congress on sept 5 
although some aspects of bennetts proposed strategy have 
triggered some bickering between agencies a source said there has 
been no opposition to expanding training by the military 
special forces troops currently train forces in bolivia and a 
source said the expansion contemplated would be building on the 
number of people we have down there 
rep charles b rangel dny chairman of the house select 
committee on narcotics abuse and control cautioned that 
increased military involvement in latin american antidrug 
efforts must be treated extremely carefully any us military 
involvement must be through multilateral efforts such as the 
organization of american states or the united nations and must be 
welcomed by the country involved 
the proposal was derided by lawrence j smith dfla chairman 
of the house foreign affairs committees task force on 
international narcotics who said 300 million for countries that 
are very beleaguered whose economies are in a shambles thats a 
spit in the ocean thats tokenism thats what it is 
giving those countries more aid would work only if they are 
capable of utilizing it smith said in an interview friday from 
his florida office most of these countries have not had the 
ability to digest more aid they dont have the troops they dont 
have the expertise 
the commitment of us military advisers equipment and economic 
aid should be dependent on the recipient countries committing their 
own military forces to the antidrug effort something they have 
done only on rare occasions he said 
ill be happy to give all that to them if theyll tell me 
theyll let the military loose to get involved in eradication 
smith said 
rangel took a somewhat different position saying merely 
increasing antinarcotics assistance without development of a 
comprehensive plan that addresses the economic and social needs of 
drugproducing countries will not succeed 
in addition to crop eradication we must improve assistance 
for law enforcement make provisions for income alternatives for 
illicit narcotics crop cultivation and consider whether debt and 
trade incentives are needed as part of an effective antinarcotics 
strategy rangel said 
capitol hills lack of access to copies of bennetts proposed 
strategy has prompted some displeasure among members of congress 
particularly those who are actively involved in drug issues both 
rangel and smith said they based their comments on news reports of 
what the strategy proposes 
the draft strategy was distributed to a select few officials in 
each of the federal agencies involved in antidrug efforts and 
they were directed to keep it confidential 
rangel and smith said they and other chairmen of congressional 
committees concerned with drug matters met with bennett last week 
he asked congress not to take seriously all the stories 
appearing in the press about the contents of the proposed 
strategy rangel said in a statement he told us he is 
presently bouncing ideas off the american people he asked us to 
reserve comment until the report is approved by the president and 
released 
among other things rangel said the strategy will be meaningful 
only if the president calls for full funding of its proposals 
the strategy will be pure rhetoric and will become a broken 
administration promise if real dollars not just the words in this 
plan are not provided he said you cant say youre going to 
declare war and provide no money for the bullets

rob russell eased into the gun turret 
adjusting his helmet and closing the hatch over his head as his 
buddy nels anderson positioned their tank russell reached for 
his ammunition a bucket of racquetballs 
as he took aim at another tank the high school freshman joined 
hundreds of others in what has become this summers hottest 
amusement park attraction tank tag 
its addictive said russell 14 of sudbury as he and 
anderson prepared for their sixth ride in the tanks at the millbury 
amusement center about 35 miles west of boston 
its a lot more realistic than a computer game said 
anderson 33 a computer programmer from framingham and you 
cant get hurt 
the countrys newest war game has sprung up at about 20 
amusement parks including ones in orlando fla myrtle beach 
sc wildwood nj and san diego and dozens of others are 
expected to follow suit 
tank tags popularity has soared since it surfaced in allentown 
pa last summer it was invented by robert plarr president of 
dorney park and wildwater kingdom in allentown 
its like being in world war ii without getting hurt said 
plarr its just like the gladiators in roman times this is the 
first time in history youre part of a shooting gallery 
more than 150 amusement park owners from around the world have 
scheduled visits to the allentown facility this month to inspect 
tank tag as a potential attraction for their own parks according 
to plarr he said a group of south koreans visited last week to see 
if they could install tank tag and a water war game at some of the 
former olympic games sites in seoul 
plarr a former marine who addresses everyone as sir or 
maam expanded his basic tank game idea to the water games 
the tag game uses two to four smallscale computerized 
madetoorder tanks that are mounted on tires instead of treads and 
powered by hydraulic honda engines 
the tanks which plarr says cost from 20000 to 40000 each 
are designed for two people one who drives the tank by 
pressing a gaspowered pedal on the floor and the other seated in 
the turret each pays 450 a ride 
the game includes 10 simulated guns placed along the perimeter 
of the tank tag area participants who choose not to ride on the 
tanks can stay behind the protective netting and fire balls paid 
for by the bucket at the tanks 
the balls shot from a tank turret or from one of the outside 
guns can go at 60 mph 
i think its kind of cute said vicki suhl 38 who watched 
her son josh 9 fire at the tanks from the perimeter its a 
bigger version of nintendo 
the only restriction on participants is height you must be at 
least 4 feet tall to crawl inside a tank 
in allentown more than 50 percent of the participants are women 
and children said plarr 
plarr avoids comment on the paramilitary aspects of tank tag he 
prefers to view the game as the heir to the carnival shooting 
gallery of the past and as testament to a new demand for 
participatory games 
people want to touch feel taste they dont want to be put 
in a car they want to drive themselves said plarr this is a 
doityourself ride

an irish republican army 
bomb was barely noticed saturday as thousands of drumbanging 
protestants celebrated a victory over a catholic king three 
centuries ago 
but the explosion that wrecked a bar four hours before the 
apprentice boys parade causing no injuries underlined tensions 
as northern ireland approaches the 20th anniversary of the british 
governments decision to send in troops 
it was the apprentice boys parade in 1969 that touched off 
rioting in roman catholic areas and led to troops arriving in the 
province on aug 14 1969 
saturdays bomb said marcher robert kerr means we have no 
security 
for the amount of money theyre spending we should get better 
security said kerr who drove 60 miles from his farm near 
dungannon to join the parade 
the bomb was only a small sample of what weve had added 
william coulter of londonderry 
police said the bomb exploded shortly after 9 am in a butcher 
street bar it had been discovered by security forces who evacuated 
the area but it exploded before army experts could defuse it said 
a spokesman who refused to be named 
the explosion shattered glass in the apprentice boys memorial 
hall but no one was hurt 
it will not stop us it will not dampen our spirits in any 
way said derek miller general secretary of the apprentice boys 
organization 
a statement released by the ira said the bomb was timed to go 
off when security forces were in the area by planting the device 
the statement said the ira proved it could strike despite heavy 
security 
the mainly catholic ira seeks to drive the british out of the 
province 
on friday night police said they seized a bomb packed with 10 
pounds of semtex plastic explosives and arrested two men in the 
catholic creggan neighborhood of londonderry 
there was heavy security along the parade route across the broad 
river foyle and through the picturesque walled city with dozens of 
gray armored police vehicles in the streets and soldiers patrolling 
in full combat gear 
the royal ulster constabulary a british police force however 
reported that the parade pased without incident 
before the parade a presbyterian minister the rev james kane 
told worshipers at st columbs anglican cathedral it would be 
wrong to provoke sectarian passions 
rather we should endeavour to teach our fellow countrymen to 
look at the past in a calm and kindly spirit to rise superior to 
the passions of the ages kane said 
the parade was a rich mixture of politics and religion with 
bands marching to such tunes as abide with me and stand up 
stand up for jesus to a martial beat 
londonderry has long been a place of mythic significance to 
protestants as the scene of a 15week siege in 1689 by the forces 
of the exiled catholic king james ii who had been ousted in favor 
of the protestant william of orange the dutchborn prince who 
ruled britain jointly with his english wife and cousin mary 
the no surrender spirit of the apprentice boys who slammed 
the city gates to prevent their leader from capitulating lives on 
as a political slogan for the socalled loyalist side the large 
segment of the protestant community that supports british rule 
aug 12 is the day the siege was lifted 
londonderry was a focus of the catholic civil rights marches of 
the 1960s because of the blatant gerrymandering that perpetuated 
the protestant minoritys control of local government 
even the name is contentious to loyalists it is londonderry to 
nationalists it is derry once catholics gained control of the 
local council it became the derry district council 
the catholic community plans its own march monday evening 
followed by a speech by bernadette devlin mcaliskey a prominent 
firebrand of the republican movement in the 1960s 
the current ira campaign dates from the turbulent days after 
british troops arrived the provisional irish republican army broke 
away from the old ira organization to wage guerrilla war on the 
british army and other targets 
british troops in the province currently number more than 
10000 compared a peak of 22000 at the height of the violence in 
1972 
they are backed by 6500 members of the ulster defense regiment 
a locally recruited unit of the british army 
since the troops arrived more than 2700 people have been slain

governing party leader fw de 
klerk indicated saturday his cabinet colleagues supported him as a 
showdown approached in a leadership struggle with outgoing 
president pw botha 
political commentators said the seemingly isolated botha might 
quit under pressure or try to assert himself at a cabinet meeting 
monday by firing de klerk who replaced the president in february 
as head of the national party 
de klerk is expected to succeed botha as president after 
parliamentary elections on sept 6 
one opposition leader andries treurnicht of the farright 
conservative party said de klerk was leading a palace 
revolution against botha and suggested the president could fire 
any rebellious ministers 
relations between botha and de klerk have been strained for 
months but the rift intensified friday when the president 
announced tersely he had not been consulted about de klerks 
planned diplomatic mission to zambia on aug 28 
de klerk met for nearly three hours saturday with almost the 
entire cabinet at his home in pretoria then announced that the 
ministers had reached a unanimous decision how to handle the 
dispute when botha convenes a full cabinet meeting on monday in 
cape town 
de klerk refused to elaborate on the decision but said the 
national party does not in the least underestimate the seriousness 
of the situation 
the dispute has deeply embarrassed the party at a crucial stage 
in election campaign and has virtually eliminated any chance for 
botha 73 to exit gracefully after 11 years in power 
de klerk and foreign minister pik botha have been invited to 
meet with zambian president kenneth kaunda a longtime critic of 
south africas racial segregation policies the meeting has been 
hailed as a potentially historic breakthrough for south africa and 
pik botha announced saturday that the trip would proceed despite 
the leadership dispute 
the meeting of cabinet members at de klerks home was viewed as 
a direct challenge by the education minister against the president 
under the constitution only the president can convene a formal 
cabinet meeting although the ministers all are national party 
members who owe political loyalty to de klerk 
pierre claassen political writer for the independent south 
african press association reported that national party 
officeholders were united in illconcealed anger at president 
botha 
leaders of the liberal and farright white opposition parties 
hoping for major gains in the elections said the dispute reflected 
chaos atop the national party which has held power since 1948 
kaunda made the initial announcement of the aug 28 meeting pik 
botha the foreign minister subsequently confirmed the plans and 
said the arrangements were made in consultation with president 
botha 
the president in a twosentence statement friday in effect 
called his foreign minister a liar 
i am not aware in terms of the rules governing overseas 
journeys by cabinet ministers of the discussions to be held on 
28 august as announced by dr kaunda the president said 
newspapers reported saturday that pik botha was braced for the 
possibility that the president might fire him the star of 
johannesburg said the entire cabinet might resign if any minister 
including de klerk were fired the citizen another johannesburg 
daily said the president could resign at any moment 
the leadership rift surfaced when botha resigned as national 
party leader after suffering a stroke in january party officials 
backed de klerk in a power struggle focusing on how soon botha 
would retire 
de klerks planned meeting with kaunda is seen as important 
because the zambian is chairman of the sixnation frontline states 
established for the purpose of confronting south africas whiteled 
government 
kaunda reportedly may offer to arrange a summit of all states in 
the region including south africa if de klerk commits his 
government to negotiating with the african national congres 
the anc headquartered in zambia has waged a bombing and 
sabotage campaign since 1961 aimed at ending whiteminority rule in 
south africa and gaining full political rights for the black 
majority

mexicos seismic center said a second quake registering 55 on 
the richter scale hit at 931 am about 175 miles southwest of 
mexico city and 100 miles from the resort of acapulco 
we felt it but it was very weak said irene banos a

received no calls for help 
some residents of mexico city reported feeling the earthquake 
slightly 
in golden colorado the us national earthquake information 
center also reported the second quake 
geophysicist john minsch said it was about 60 miles deep 
which might account for it being felt over longer distances he 
said the deep quakes dont cause as much damage as shallow 
earthquakes 
earthquakes are common along mexicos seismically active west 
coast 
a pair of massive earthquakes struck mexico city in september 
1985 killing an estimated 10000 people and destroying hundreds of 
buildings the first registered 81 on the richter scale and 
another the following day registered 75

the pentagon on saturday dispatched five more 
aircraft and 100 more people to ethiopia to help search for rep 
mickey leland and his office chief backed off earlier criticism of 
the rescue effort by saying she is now tremendously gratified 
by it 
navy capt stan bloyer declared were not anywhere close to 
scaling down the hunt for leland dtexas and 15 others whose 
chartered twin otter vanished monday on a flight from addis ababa 
to a refugee camp near the sudan border about 270 miles 
westsouthwest of the capital 
were going to apply all the resources we can use said 
bloyer former air operations chief of the sixth fleet and now with 
the joint chiefs of staff were going to continue to operate on 
the premise that there are survivors 
bloyer said the us team is again concentrating its search 
including photoreconnaissance flights by u2 spy planes along 
lelands planned flight path after concluding that two earlier 
leads involving faint signals detected both north and south of 
addis ababa by weather satellites were merely false readings 
as of saturday the us military had one c141 medical 
evacuation aircraft two hc130 search and rescue aircraft and 
four mh60 search and rescue helicopters equipped with special 
nightvision gear stationed in ethiopia along with 165 men and 
women bloyer said he reported that two more hc130s one ec130 
command and control aircraft and two c141 transports were on the 
way along with 100 more people and would arrive sunday 
the latest contingent includes maj gen james f record 
director of operations of the us central command at macdill air 
force base in florida who will coordinate the american team 
coupled with the efforts of ethiopia bloyer said im not 
aware of any search and rescue effort in the world thats involved 
this many airplanes 
but he noted that the effort continues to be dogged by poor 
weather limiting the usefulness of the 6000 feet of film returned 
from each of the u2 overflights and hampering the visibility of 
the lowerflying rescue fleet 
two u2 flights have yielded no results and a third u2 mission 
was flown saturday each flight lasts 10 hours with just two of 
those over the search area and developing and analyzing the huge 
amount of film requires many additional hours 
in washington meanwhile lelands press secretary and office 
chief alma newsom retreated from her angry criticism friday of 
the rescue effort 
following reassurances later friday from president bush and 
others she said the staff is convinced that a commitment and 
sense of urgency are now operating at all levels we are 
tremendously gratified by that 
ms newsom had said friday that we have seen motion we have 
seen some action but we have also seen a lot of missteps adding 
that we could have and should have located them by now 
saturday in voice weakened by laryngitis she said i was 
somewhat astounded and not a little distressed that some had 
interpreted my remarks yesterday as being antimilitary antiour 
men and women in the military nothing could be further from the 
truth we all believe that when the us armed forces come to 
the rescue they have no peer 
bloyer said that while us authorities have permission to 
operate in the skies over sudan the main search effort will 
continue to be focused inside ethiopia for the time being 
certainly it is possible the airplane proceeded into sudan and 
we will be exploring that in due course he said 
until now he said the us planes have used techniques that 
would give a 50 percent probability of detection in the primary 
search area were changing now to a much slower and deliberate 
mode which should give us n 8090 percent capability of 
detection he explained 
the four helicopters flown in from eglin air force base in 
florida are equipped with infrared devices and crews trained in 
night vision but regular night flights likely wont begin until 
monday weather allowing when relief crews are available he said 
as it is the choppers are flying throughout the daylight hours 
with midair refueling from the hc130s he said 
earlier in the week hopes were raised that either of the two 
signals monitored via satellite had come from the planes emergency 
beacon but bloyer explained that the only ground station able to 
monitor the satellite data as it passed over ethiopia is in india 
so far away that its on the very fringes of the ability to 
decipher the signal correctly 
sophisticated electronic gear on lowerflying us planes found 
no signals at the two locations and moreover no evidence was 
found in either area by thousand of ethiopian troops which combed 
them on oot he said 
bloyer noted however that the planes emergency beacon would 
begin to deteriorate after 72 hours and any usable signal 
likely would disappear in a week as the transmitters batteries 
wore down

strike and another protest monday if authorities fail to meet their 
demands said mamedgassan gambarov a member of the azerbaijani

removal of soviet troops from nagornokarabakh a mainly christian 
armenian enclave in traditionally shiite moslem azerbaijan

order scores of people have been killed and thousands fled their 
homes 
slogans at saturdays protest included karabakh and azerbaijan 
are indivisible according to yestekov who said he heads a 
fledgling news agency specializing in moslem areas of the soviet 
union

gave no specific figure 
speakers also called for authorities to give the peoples front 
full legal status as an organization yestekov said 
peoples front groups have sprung up in many of the 15 soviet 
republics in an effort to push local demands for autonomy they 
have become especially strong in the baltic republics

sen warren rudman told chinese leaders saturday 
that if china maintains its crackdown on dissent the us congress 
might approve even harsher sanctions on the communist nation 
the new hampshire republican said he met with wan li chairman 
of the national peoples congresss standing committee and vice 
foreign minister zhu qizhen to make sure chinese leaders 
understood clearly the impact of the events of june on the 
american people 
it was the first meeting by a ranking us lawmaker since 
washington banned diplomatic contacts with the chinese leadership 
in june because of the violent suppression of prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
rudman said the ban applies only to the executive branch not 
to members of congress my visit doesnt change the status of 
our uschinese relations at all 
i thought it was extremely important that they understand that 
there is a deep feeling in the united states congress about what 
happened here in june rudman told reporters 
washington imposed the ban to protest the killing of hundreds 
and perhaps thousands of people when the army crushed the 
studentled democracy movement in beijing june 34 and continued 
the crackdown in other cities 
the chinese ought to understand very clearly that if certain 
things dont change or if there were a repeat of some of those 
events we can expect congress to react very vigorously rudman 
said 
he came to beijing at the invitation of the chinese institute of 
foreign affairs 
rudman said he briefed vice foreign minister zhu who is the 
ambassadordesignate to the united states on what to expect in 
washington and told zhu and wan li that many members of congress 
advocate harsher sanctions against beijing 
chinas official xinhua news agency said wan li told rudman that 
legislative sanctions against china constitute gross interference 
in chinas internal affairs and we cannot but react strongly 
in addition to the prohibition of highlevel contacts the 
united states the european economic community and some other 
western nations also are maintaining indefinite bans on military 
exchanges arms sales and new soft loans 
rudman said as much as they the chinese would like to 
criticize us for meddling in their internal affairs it wasnt 
meddling at all 
rudman expressed support of president bushs opposition to 
stricter legislative actions and said he told the chinese officials 
most members of congress do agree with president bush that this 
relationship is very important 
but he added to the extent chinas internal affairs tend to 
offend some basic values americans hold that would limit the 
freedom of action of the president 
it could result in a response from congress that would further 
injure the relationship 
rudman said he did not come to beijing to act as a negotiator 
in my view only the president and his representative the 
ambassador can negotiate or offer the assurances of the united 
states rudman said i thought it was important that they 
chinese leaders understood that the congress has a major role to 
play in this

british nobility joined american cowboys and 
other northern plains states descendants saturday to dedicate fort 
union once the frontiers fur trading headquarters and to mark 
two neighboring states centennials 
the fort which played host to visitors ranging from prince 
maximilian of germany to naturalist james j audubon in the 1800s 
has been rebuilt to highlight the centennials of north dakota and 
neighboring montana 
an estimated 15000 people were expected to attend the twoday 
dedication of the fouryear multimilliondollar restoration 
project by the national park service 
the national park service and everyone else associated with it 
should be proud of their effort said lord john jacob astor viii 
a direct descendant of john jacob astor the founder of the 
powerful american fur trading co that built fort union in 1829 
located near the north dakotamontana border at the confluence 
of the yellowstone and missouri rivers fort union was a 
headquarters for fur traders and indians of the mid1800s 
the area now is dominated by hulking oil rigs farms and 
ranches a few buffalo also can be found remnants of the herds 
that once roamed the prairie 
this is a piece of american history said peter abram a 
vacationing barrie ontario resident who toured the fort saturday 
with his wife irma its hard not to think of the poor buggers 
who built this originally the hardships they endured 
fort union dominated the economy of the northern plains until 
the army dismantled it more than a century ago when the american 
fur trading co went out of business 
the army used some of the doors windows and wood from the 
civilian fort to build its fort buford just east of the trading 
post 
nothing was left of the original trading post and reconstruction 
depended on diaries paintings and photographs for design and 
detail said paul hedren superintendent of the 430acre park 
weve been faithful to the forts original design as much as 
possible hedren said the fort you see today we feel is what 
fur traders on the missouri saw in the mid1800s 
the centerpiece of the fort is the colorful bourgeois house 
finished in 1987 it now contains museum exhibits and 
administrative offices 
the whitewashed walls of the fort began going up this past 
spring and were completed just in time for the dedication two 
bastions housing cannons sit at two corners of the facility 
modernday buckskinners dressed in clothing of the period 
relived the past saturday by peddling buffalo hides beaver pelts 
and beadwork at a tepee encampment near the fort 
joining in the festivities was a contingent of royal canadian 
mounted police officers from manitoba and saskatchewan who appeared 
in the distinctive garb of their 1870s predecessors 
im a history nut a buckskin nut an indian nut said jim 
bill henderson of jefferson city mo who took part in living 
history activities at the fort saturday 
henderson a teddy roosevelt lookalike who is working this 
summer at mount rushmore in south dakota attended the dedication 
in a replica of the uniform roosevelt wore in the spanishamerican 
war 
nearly 4 million has gone into the reconstruction of the fort 
about 33 million came from the federal government and about 
500000 was provided by local supporters called friends of fort 
union

state legislatures are under pressure to act 
on a variety of issues including abortion lawmakers were told 
during a national convention 
the 5000 delegates to the national conference of state 
legislatures got the grim word from panelists and bush 
administration officials in dozens of sessions at the sixday 
meeting which ended friday 
increased spending is the prescription for most of the ills but 
the states economic future is clouded by large trade and federal 
budget deficits said samuel nunez jr louisiana senate president 
pro tempore and president of the ncsl 
unfunded federal mandates have added billions of dollars in new 
responsibilities for the states in recent years nunez said 
federal welfare reform and changes in catastrophic health care and 
nursing home legislation will also raise state costs he said 
a survey by ncsl staff showed that education makes up more than 
50 percent of state budgets nationwide the overall increase in 
spending was 72 percent up from 66 percent a year ago spending 
on corrections rose 141 percent while the increase in medicaid 
costs was 104 percent 
the greatest concentration of fiscal problems this year was in 
the new england states and in new york and new jersey places that 
just two years ago were faring better than most states said lee 
daniels ncsl presidentelect and minority leader of the illinois 
house 
while some delegates claimed a continuing erosion of state 
sovereignty by the federal government one of the highestprofile 
topics at the convention was an issue many legislators would rather 
leave to the us supreme court abortion 
about 600 demonstrators half of them chanting prochoice 
slogans and the other half singing hymns and carrying antiabortion 
placards marched downtown monday as delegates arrived for a social 
event 
in a july 3 decision in a missouri case the high court 
implicitly invited states to enact their own laws on abortion 16 
years after the court made abortion legal 
its not our business joan lawrence state representative 
from ohio told a crowded session on wednesday were going to be 
making a serious mistake if we step into this swamp 
but massachusetts state sen paul white told lawmakers they 
wont be able to steer clear of the issue 
were stuck with the fact that this is an issue that has to be 
dealt with white said it isnt going to evaporate it isnt 
going to disappear 
i dont think this is an issue about polls or holding your 
finger in the wind to see which way the wind is blowing he said 
i think this is an issue that you have to look within yourself 
us health and human services secretary louis sullivan us 
secretary of transportation secretary samuel skinner and former 
environmental protection agency administrator william ruckelshaus 
also had advice for lawmakers 
sullivan called for more state spending to lower infant 
mortality and skinner urged states to raise local gasoline taxes 
and spend more on highways ruckelshaus now head of a large waste 
disposal company said lawmakers should show more backbone in 
finding sites for solid waste landfills 
deputy energy secretary henson moore said his department will 
design a road map for a national energy policy but said many 
of the policies must be implemented at the state level

hundreds of eastern airlines union members on 
saturday launched a 26day series of rallies and other actions to 
gain support for their strike which has been weakened by 
picketline crossings and courtroom setbacks 
the rally near eastern headquarters was attended by a crowd 
estimated at 300 to 500 people 
these people over across the street have done a good job in 
their psychological warfare now theyre out there telling the 
world its over well its not over said charles e bryan 
district 100 president of the machinists union so hang in there 
therell be good news coming 
henry a duffy national president of the air line pilots 
association joined bryan and other machinists pilots and flight 
attendants on the first blocks of a moving picket line march 
journey for justice read tshirts worn by many of the 
picketers 
the rally opened a 26day series of parades motorcades 
rallies petition drives and lobbying planned in 13 states 
alpa which represents pilots at nearly every major carrier has 
been discussing a nationwide job action to show support for eastern 
workers 
duffy said the unions want to ensure that the public understands 
that the strike which began march 4 is still on the unions also 
want to spur congressional action pressure president bush to 
intervene and revitalize solidarity throughout the national labor 
movement he said 
duffy said labor leaders will urge senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine to push a housepassed bill calling on bush to 
appoint a presidential emergency board that could send the unions 
back to work while trying to reach a settlement duffy called that 
action the best hope for ending the strike 
bush refused in the early days of the strike to intervene 
this is an important strike not only for alpa and eastern 
employees but for the national labor movement duffy said 
adding that what he called the antiunion management tactics of 
texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo must be stopped he also 
predicted eastern wont survive unless its veteran employees return 
to work 
the publicity turned against us but not to the point its 
going to stop the strike duffy added in an interview 
discussion a week ago by the pilots union leadership about 
ending the strike spurred the most picketline crossovers since the 
walkouts first week an estimated 250 union pilots returned to 
work last week prompting eastern to stop hiring new pilots and 
about 140 flight attendants crossed the lines 
eastern said friday it has enough pilots for its plan to rebuild 
despite the strike but bryan said eastern because of a shortage 
of mechanics and spare parts doesnt have enough flightready 
planes 
john j bavis easterns alpa local chairman said easterns 
announcement was meant to hurt union morale 
they want to scare the hell out of people trying to break 
us bavis said 
bryan who said only 2 percent of his unions 8500 members have 
returned to work said the pilot crossovers has been damaging to 
the morale of the people because the machinists emphasized the 
importance of pilot support the machinists struck after 1 years 
of federal mediation failed and were joined by the pilots and 
flight attendants 
company spokesman robin matell declined to comment on the union 
rally and denied that eastern had claimed victory 
there are no winners in a strike he said fridays 
announcement was just to state the facts that no more pilots 
are needed matell said 
eastern which filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
five days into the strike plans to rebuild to an airline 
twothirds of its prestrike size the companys plan for its 
creditors said it will fly 800 daily flights with 1700 pilots by 
the end of the year 
eastern has 350 daily flights compared with nearly 1100 before 
the strike 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said more than 
600 union pilots of 3600 have returned to work joining 300 
newly hired pilots who completed training and 700 to 800 in 
training

gen manuel antonio noriega panamas 
de facto leader on saturday quietly celebrated the sixth 
anniversary of his command of panamas defense forces 
no public ceremonies marking the anniversary were announced by 
the noriegacontrolled government or defense forces 
the anniversary followed several confrontations between us 
military personnel and defense forces troopers in recent days 
on friday a panamanian patrol briefly detained us military 
police in four vehicles in the curundu area near the panama canal 
earlier last week american troops blockaded fort amador which 
contains both us and panamanian military facilities 
noriega has rebuffed all us efforts including economic 
sanctions to force him to step down 
washington has exerted pressure to remove noriega since two 
federal grand juries in florida indicted him on drug trafficking 
and money laundering charges in february 1988 he denies the 
charges 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said in washington friday 
that the bush administration would not rule out seizing noriega 
and taking him to florida to face drug trafficking charges but 
fitzwater said bush was not contemplating such a move at this time 
opposition leader ricardo arias calderon told a news conference 
saturday the presidents of colombia peru and venezuela believe 
that noriega is the major obstacle to democracy in panama 
calderon said he and guillermo ford met last week with the 
presidents and other officials in those south american nations 
calderon and ford were the two vice presidential candidates on the 
opposition slate in the may 7 elections 
calderon said the three presidents have a very clear idea that 
popular sovereignty and national sovereignty cannot be dissociated 
and they consider that only a free people can really be sovereign 
international observers said the opposition won the may election 
by a landslide but the government annulled the balloting a few 
days later saying there had been vote fraud guillermo endara was 
the oppositions presidential candidate 
the opposition has proposed a plebicite this month to allow 
panamanians to decide whether they want noriega to continue in his 
command 
noriega said friday the proposal was tantamount to turning 
panama into a colony that accepts arrogance vassalage and 
indignity 
he made the comment in a speech at a parade of thousands of 
troopers and paramilitary civilian units ending a 10day exercise 
called zap the intruder 
us officials say the us forces have the right to conduct 
their own exercises under the 1977 panama canal treaties to assure 
the security of the canal 
noriega claims the united states wants to abrogate the treaties 
which provide for the canal to be turned over to panama at the end 
of 1999

has urged the military government to hold free elections and end 
their 27year rule in the former british colony she was one of the

year 
a foreign office spokesman speaking anonymously said burma was 
being unacceptable when it insists that aris consider himself under 
the same restrictions as his wife if he chooses to stay in the 
country 
the couples sons alexander 16 and kim 13 subject to 
similar restrictions would be returning to britain to continue 
their education 
aris said he was applying for his visa to be extended beyond

his wifes continued wellbeing he intends to return to the united 
kingdom in early september

halfhour in the deep end before he was rescued 
fadge a 9yearold 1100pound arabian was rescued friday

of water until rescue crews could save him 
the horse was discovered by 3yearold ashley aceves whose 
father henry owns both the horse and the house 
at first i thought it was a paper horse because horses arent 
supposed to be in swimming pools said ashley 
aceves had to drain the pool so that fadge could stand until 
rescuers arrived firefighters and animal control officers used a 
tarpulin and ropes to pull the animal out but only after they 
coaxed him to the shallow end 
the horse was exhausted and disoriented but otherwise unhurt 
said animal control officer leslie byrnes 
its a good thing we got here when we did because he was going 
to drown byrnes said he had given up and probably thought he 
was going to die in there 
aceves said the animal was trying to reach the fig tree in the 
yard

are people like maria and carlos hernandez koch said the city 
should tell hernandez and others with the courage to take a stand 
you are not alone he added 
after the funeral friends and supporters gathered in front of 
the hernandezs home police estimated as many as 300 people 
marched on foot while behind them were dozens of cars 
jacqueline perez a family friend said she and her children 
were marching so that hernandez would know that people are with 
him this has to be stopped one way or another 
she really died a martyr said a 28yearold administrative 
assistant and marcher who declined to give her name saying she is 
active in the fight against drugs in her own neighborhood

east germany on saturday defended the berlin wall 
built 28 years ago to block east germans from fleeing to the west 
and said hopes for the removal of the barrier are illusory 
neues deutschland the newspaper of the east german communist 
party said the wall is a step toward peace and repeated the 
government stand that it will remain in place as long as the reason 
for its construction exists 
sunday is the anniversary of the construction of the wall on 
aug 13 1961 
president bush issued a statement saturday calling the wall 
the relic of a bygone era and a failed policy 
we observe this sad anniversary with renewed determination to 
overcome the division of berlin and of europe bush said in the 
statement from camp david md he said he hoped for a soviet 
response that would make berlin divided into east and west berlin 
a place of cooperation not a point of confrontation 
in its commentary neues deutschland accused the west of trying 
to economically plunder and destabilize east germany 
after world war ii and the division of germany hundreds of 
thousands of people fled from sovietcontrolled east germany until 
the concrete and barbedwire wall was built the east german 
economy struggled and stumbled as workers scientists artists and 
intellectuals escaped to the west 
once in west germany the east germans qualify for immediate 
citizenship and social assistance 
another flow of east german refugees has been moving recently 
through communist hungary which has dismantled much of its border 
barriers with austria 
east germans can gain permission to travel to hungary with 
relative ease and an estimated 1500 have gone to hungary this 
summer and then escaped through austria into west germany 
as many as 400 other east germans are seeking refuge at west 
german embassies in budapest prague and east berlin and seeking 
exit visas west germany has allowed them to stay in the embassies 
but on tuesday it closed the doors of its east berlin mission 
saying it was crowded and could not accommodate any more people

the coast guard ticketed six shrimpers 
for violating new trawlingtime restrictions intended to keep sea 
turtles from drowning authorities said saturday 
five shrimpers in galveston and one in freeport were issued 
citations for trawling without turtle excluder devices during 
30minute restricted periods said coast guard spokesman don merwin 
the new regulations being rigorously enforced since friday night 
require shrimpers to limit trawling to 105minute intervals as 
outlined by a coast guard time chart or use the devices which are 
designed to allow sea turtles to escape from shrimping nets 
the devices are big boxes attached to nets with hinged sides 
that turtles can swim through 
shrimpers who elect not to use the devices have to pull their 
nets from the water during the 30minute intervals when trawling is 
prohibited 
i would think that a vessel that has its nets in the water 
during those periods will be a good candidate for boarding coast 
guard spokesman nicholas sandifer said in washington 
the coast guard has been broadcasting the time schedules and is 
warning shrimpers before each 30minute ban goes into effect 
merwin said 
shrimpers out during the 30minute intervals are being asked to 
pull in their nets for inspection those without the devices are 
fined 
the maximum fine for a first and second offense is 8000 the 
maximum fine for a third offense is 12000 fines are levied by 
the national marines fisheries service merwin said 
the coast guard is patrolling areas from cameron la to 
freeport 
the order to enforce the limited trawling option was issued at 6 
pm thursday three hours later the captain of a shrimping vessel 
off the florida coast was cited after a coast guard boarding crew 
observed that it was trawling illegally coast guard officials said 
shrimpers who have fought against using the excluder devices are 
concerned that the regulations implemented by us commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher are so complicated they will be hard to 
follow

thousands of shiite moslems in 
southern lebanon commemorated the holy day of ashura saturday with 
many striking their heads with the flat edge of their swords or 
chains until they drew blood 
ashura marking the death in battle of shiite saint hussein in 
ad 680 is the holiest day of the year for the worlds 100 
million shiite moslems 
scores of whiterobed shiites bleeding from head wounds and 
chanting religious verses led a procession through nabatiyeh 
iran a moslem country with fundamentalist shiite leaders will 
commemorate ashura sunday 
ashura is derived from the arabic word for the number 10 it 
refers to the first 10 days of the first month of the islamic lunar 
calendar muharram culminating in the tenth day the day of 
husseins death 
the division of islam into shiite and sunni groups developed 
after the death in 632 of mohammed the founder of the faith 
mohammeds closest followers determined that his companion abu 
bakr be declared the next leader of islam 
a minority of moslems challenged the dicision and argued that 
the leadership should be dynastic and should therefore have gone to 
ali the soninlaw and cousin of mohammed who had no sons 
ali did become leader but after his death in 661 a dynasty 
known as the ummayids and based in syria declared it was the ruler 
of islam 
hussein the son of ali challenged the ummayid rule and the 
ummayids representing the mainstream sunnis sought to crush 
husseins movement 
in 680 the ummayid forces surrounded hussein and his followers 
and killed them in a battle at kerbala about 100 miles south of 
baghdad in modern iraq 
but the victory did not crush the shiites and husseins death 
added an element of passion to shiism which venerates martyrdom 
shiites follow the same major rules and rites as the sunni 
moslem majority of about 800 million including five prayers a day 
the pilgrimage to mecca and fasting in the holy month of ramadan

conn apartment building where collapsing ceilings chased out 
eight families 
ive lost everything my furniture my clothes my car 
said santiago caballero a 63yearold unemployed farmworker who 
said he saved for 10 years to buy his modest home in yuma ariz 
across the state line from southern california

colorado springs colo reported street flooding from 3 inches 
of rain that fell during an hour and a half one parking lot was

brought the torrential rain in the new york city area with 29 
inches from midnight to 3 pm up to 10 inches of rain fell friday 
at the eastern end of long island the national weather service 
reported 
more than an inch of rain fell in one hour in new york early 
saturday morning and again in an afternoon hour but the amounts 
were well short of the onehour record of over 2 inches set in 
1983 said meteorologist ben scott 
that word would have provided little solace however to 
thousands of new york pedestrians who found themselves wrapped in 
sheets of falling water or to subway riders whose packed trains 
were stalled by power shutoffs caused by the flooding 
suburban travelers had problems too in pelham manor just north 
of the city 666 inches fell between midnight and 3 pm closing

conservation program and be water tight said rich atwater 
director of resources for the metropolitan water district of 
southern california 
the repairs were expected to cost at least 500000 and highway 
damage in the sierra nevada was reported at more than 1 million

a coroner may have acted callously in removing 
a dead mans corneas for transplant despite his familys 
objections but he did not violate anyones rights a federal judge 
ruled 
us district judge s arthur spiegel on friday dismissed a 15 
million lawsuit against the hamilton county coroners office 
brought by steven brothertons survivors 
the judge expressed concern at the coroners arbitrary and 
insensitive actions but said he had no option but to dismiss the 
lawsuit which also named an eye bank and an organ procurement 
center 
spiegel said the family was mistaken in making property claims 
in the case but told them they could sue in a state court in which 
the defendants can be accused of causing severe emotional distress 
defendants in the lawsuit included the coroner dr frank 
cleveland the cincinnati eye bank for sight restoration and the 
ohio valley organ procurement center 
brothertons wife deborah refused bethesda north hospitals 
request for an organ donation following her husbands death saying 
her husband was opposed to the practice 
cleveland later allowed a technician from the eye bank to remove 
brothertons corneas even though his wifes objections to organ 
donations were included in hospital records of brothertons death 
clear corneas from dead people are used in transplant operations 
to replace corneas that are clouded by cataracts 
spiegel said the hospital made no effort to relay deborah 
brothertons objections to cleveland he also said the coroner 
routinely allows removal of corneas without looking at medical 
records or documents belonging to the dead people from whom the 
corneas are taken 
cleveland was not available for comment

none of the awards was illegal the newspaper said 
republican consultants developers and members of congress 
secured favors from hud by appealing to the political loyalties of 
hud managers the times said 
democratic representatives also approached hud officials for 
grants and subsidies but more often they took advantage of their

longer wish just to wait especially since major changes for the 
better are taking place around us 
it is to be expected that this year many people will wish 
to express their disagreement 
the changes it referred to are reforms under way in the soviet 
union and some sovietbloc countries including hungary and poland

the white house sifting through offers hints 
and statements from the middle east about american hostages in 
lebanon says the united states wants to let these issues play 
out for a few days and see what happens 
we get a lot of different statements some optimistic some 
pessimistic some critical some crazy said white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater 
we watch them all analyze them all and in a sense the public 
and the press all are seeing the process pretty much as it is 
the latest development was a conditional offer of assistance 
from the spiritual leader of the proiranian group hezbollah 
believed to be the umbrella for shiite moslem factions holding most 
of the 16 western hostages in lebanon

the justice department is hardening its 
assessment of the damage done by public disclosure to its 
investigation of suspected soviet spy felix s bloch 
justice department spokesman david runkel said flatly friday 
that the july 21 disclosure that the 54yearold us diplomat was 
under investigation had compromised the investigation 
there is no doubt that the premature disclosure of that case 
the premature disclosure that there was an ongoing investigation 
did compromise the investigation runkel said 
he didnt explain how the investigation had been compromised 
however runkels assessment was much stronger than one he

theres not much complaining going on about the 
summer doldrums on wall street this year 
or if there is its hard to hear it above the din of record or 
nearrecord highs in stock prices and increasingly optimistic 
appraisals of the state of the nations economy 
things are even looking a little brighter for the securities 
industry one of the few sectors of the economy that felt severe 
ill effects from the crash of 1987 
in the last few weeks just about all the major stockmarket 
indicators have reached new peaks surpassing the highs they set 
two years ago before stock prices collapsed 
the laggard dow jones average of 30 industrials nearly made it 
to new high ground as well in the past week before afternoon 
selling on friday turned it back 
stock investors could hardly fault the news background which 
showed a 04 percent decline in the producer price index and a 09 
percent increase in retail sales for july 
those government figures suggested more strength in the consumer 
economy and at the same time less upward pressure on inflation 
than analysts had generally expected 
indeed most of the evidence lately has tended to dispel fears 
of an impending economic slump of major proportions 
that possibility looks extremely remote said john connolly 
an analyst at dean witter reynolds inc the economy is 
decelerating gradually not rapidly 
soft landing is still the best bet observed maury harris 
economist at painewebber inc 
analysts say wall streets fortunes have benefited in particular 
from signs since late spring that individual investors slow to 
heal from the wounds of the 87 crash have at least been returning 
in significant numbers 
retail activity is at its best level since the crash 
observed larry eckenfelder who follows the brokerage industry for 
the firm of prudentialbache securities 
its early and a severe market downturn could nip it in the 
bud but it looks as though the individual is coming back to the 
stock and bond markets 
at the close of business on friday the dow jones average of 30 
industrials stood at 268399 up 3054 from the week before but 
still shy of the closing high of 272242 it set on aug 25 1987 
other readings for the week showed the new york stock exchange 
composite index up 63 at 19227 the nasdaq composite index for 
the overthecounter market up 506 at 46248 and the american 
stock exchange market value index up 454 at 38064 
volume on the big board averaged 20081 million shares a day up 
from 18243 million the week before and the heaviest total this 
year 
the pace of activity belied augusts onetime image as the 
slowest period of the year on the street a pattern that has been 
fading for years as investing institutions have come to play a 
bigger and bigger part in the markets 
individuals still carry a lot of weight however if not 
through direct purchases and sales of stock then through moving 
their money in and out of mutual funds that in turn invest it in 
the stock market 
the public has finally shifted to the buy side on stock mutual 
funds for the first time since the crash said martin zweig in a 
recent edition of his advisory the zweig forecast if the public 
comes back here it could be a big plus

in the beginning there were digital 
computers they were big slow and very stupid a halfcentury 
later digital computers are very small and fast but theyre still 
hopeless idiots compared to humans 
the main problem was and still is that computers just cant 
think 
but what if computer circuits could be made to resemble our 
brains what if they could learn from their mistakes 
hundreds of tiny companies have sprung up in the past three 
years hoping to answer and cash in on those questions with an 
approach called neural networks after the neurons that are the 
basic structure of the human nervous system 
carlos tapang a 36yearold filipino physicist who left intel 
corp to start syntonic systems inc shipped what he believes is 
the first commercially available neural network chip to 
electrodyne a japanese company in may 
the chip is called dendros1 a reference to dendrites the 
highly branched filaments of nerve or brain cells that let the 
cells communicate it simulates neurons by combining a variety of 
signals to come up with a single result 
tapang compares it to measuring the flow of water through a vast 
network of differentsized pipes by emptying them into a single 
pool such a system of computing values is called analog which 
implies a continuous form of measurement like the sweep second 
hand on a watch 
digital computers like digital watches chop time and numbers 
into tiny bits and add them up one at a time in fact bits are 
the smallest unit of information in the binary system that is the 
brain of a digital computer 
the great advantage of todays digital computers is that they 
can add those bits incredibly fast even if it is done only one bit 
at a time 
there is some evidence from research on animals and people that 
the neural cells in our brains use a kind of digital system to 
transmit signals these onoff pulses called spikes confused 
early researchers and led some to believe that the brain relied on 
a digital model to process information 
instead they found it was only a tiny portion of a complex 
electrochemical system that channels signals the way tapang is 
trying to imitate a neuron by itself is dumb but the totality 
of that network of neurons in our skull is probably the most 
intelligent machine in the universe he said 
the key word is network it is the interaction of neurons in 
our brains that gives rise to thought not the action of a single 
neuron 
in that sense tapang said digital computers are doomed to be 
electronic dunces because their chips were designed to be solitary 
devices called central processing units channeling all operations 
through one electronic pipe 
even if cpus are connected the result is only a faster dunce 
however some computer scientists and industry analysts are 
skeptical 
neural networks will be a fine addition to what weve got now 
but theyll just supplement it said esther dyson editor and 
publisher of release 10 a new yorkbased computer newsletter 
theyll never replace the mathematically precise logic of a 
digital system 
i fundamentally disagree with this bated breath attitude in 
the industry about the next breakthrough being neural chips or 
networks theyre good at things like pattern recognition but still 
cannot cope with our kind of fuzzy thinking a lawyer might ask 
colonel north why did you do that and accept a fuzzy answer 
but a computer cant 
one san jose califbased company synaptics has used neural 
network technology to develop what it calls a silicon retina an 
array of photo sensors emulates the light receptors in the eye and 
an analog computer processes the image for display on a video 
monitor 
tapang uses capacitors to simulate neurons which rely on 
chemicals to transmit signals between synapses capacitors store 
and release electricity in much the same way dendros1 has one 
fixed connection and 22 variable ones that simulate synapses it 
can be layered with other chips to create an overlapping network of 
communicating capacitors that fire signals to each other 
as in the brain the firing of one electronic neuron affects the 
others an important feature is each neurons ability to damp its 
neighbors creating a pattern the variable interaction is a 
crucial part of the network 
the applications for tapangs chip include things like pattern 
recognition 
dyson agrees the best uses for neural chips and networks would 
be tasks like analyzing seismic patterns to predict earthquakes and 
hunt for oil or gas analyzing brain waves identifying 
fingerprints or other classification chores 
but she remains skeptical about their potential so does dave 
waltz of thinking machines corp in cambridge mass which makes 
a supercomputer built of up to 64000 digital processors harnessed 
together 
the problem with neural networks is that you cant keep 
expanding them waltz said the whole field of neuropsychology 
says that increasing the scale means greater complexity if you 
scale up the size of a neural net you increase the complexity of 
solving the problems you give it 
mathematicians claim they can use mathematical functions to 
achieve the same effect as neural networks and such formulas can 
be readily understood he said the main problem with neural 
networks is that we just dont understand how they really work any 
more than we understand how the brain really works 
waltz believes the boom in neural network research will slow but 
that interest will continue because it is easier to write 
programs for neural nets than for any other system almost anybody 
can play the game 
the digital age is over and the analog era is here tapang 
said the next step is making computer chips that can communicate 
with each other and this is a step in that direction

theyre ready to start the celebration here on 
wall street but the guest of honor still hasnt shown up 
the missing party in question is the dow jones average of 30 
industrials one of the few widely recognized measures of stock 
price trends that hasnt reached a record high this summer 
f it doesnt put in an appearance before long some wouldbe 
revelers worry the hors doeuvres might wilt and the punch might 
go flat 
standard amp poors 500stock composite index the benchmark 
against which most professional investors gauge their results 
surpassed its high from the summer of 1987 a couple of weeks ago 
the separate indicators for the new york and american stock 
exchanges and the overthecounter market all have lately topped 
their precrash peaks so have measures of mutualfund performance 
which matter especially to the great majority of individual 
investors 
so too has the dows sister average that tracks transportation 
stocks 
but official certification that the stock market has fully 
recovered from the crash that occurred in august september and 
october of 87 has been left to await a new high in the dow 
as close as it came last thursday and friday the averages aug 
25 1987 close of 272242 still stood as the record when the 
weekend arrived the average fell 2864 points friday to finish the 
week at 268399 
by what right has this stubborn creature held up the 
festivities well analysts say it has the privileges of seniority 
if nothing else 
the dow jones industrial average is the granddaddy of all the 
market indices noted analysts at drexel burnham lambert inc in 
a recent commentary on the situation 
developed at the end of the last century it was designed to 
be easy to calculate in those days of inkwells and green eyeshades 
most of the newer market indices are broader in scope and track 
many more individual issues 
to be fair about it the average has been modernized over the 
past decade or so to include such stalwart companies of the 1980s 
as mcdonalds cocacola and american express among its 30 
components 
still analysts say the average remains dominated by 
smokestack industrial companies whose stocks have lagged of 
late because of intensified international competition and most 
recently worries about a possible recession in this country 
the djia being a laggard is somewhat unusual observed 
edward nicoski at the brokerage firm of piper jaffray amp hopwood 
inc in a recent commentary but because of the 
economicsensitive nature of many of its components it should not 
be totally unexpected 
since the market peak two years ago the biggest drag on the dow 
average has been one of its most illustrious members international 
business machines which remained last week more than 55 below its 
1987 high of 17487 
analysts say the dow also has suffered from a special factor a 
dearth of takeover interest in most of its components because of 
their size behemoths like general electric and philip morris are 
more likely to be acquirers as they have been than acquirees 
if the industrials had attracted bids the way issues in the 
transportation average nwa ual and so forth have lately the 
story would have been much different 
in fact members of the industrial elite have become takeover 
targets in the past for example general foods from philip 
morris in 1985 on those occasions objections have often been 
raised that the dow was overstating the markets strength

despite the brains and technology that 
manipulate todays investment strategies the financial markets 
have once again demonstrated their packlike behavior 
at first it seemed as if encouraging signals about the economy 
would propel the stock market to a total recovery from the 
cataclysmic plunge of october 1987 
indeed so much attention was riveted on the undulating dow 
jones average the last major stock index that hadnt decisively 
pierced its precrash high that the indexs halfhourly moves 
friday were followed like rounds of a boxing match 
but for reasons that perhaps could be best described as a sudden 
change of heart by the buyers bond prices reversed themselves 
after a hearty runup and stocks blindly followed sending the dow 
average and other indexes lower 
sophisticated strategists who had put themselves on a limb by 
gambling that prices would rise had to scramble to sell their 
earlier thinking rendered useless by the mass transformation of 
buyers into sellers 
some economists found what seemed to be a logical explanation 
for the sudden shift in psychology by reassessing the government 
reports on inflation and consumer spending released friday 
the report on a 04 percent drop in wholesale prices in july 
for example initially suggested investors shouldnt worry about 
inflation a good reason to buy stocks and bonds but it was 
viewed later as a sign that interest rates could decline 
precipitously and inflation could surge anew a good reason to 
sell 
the market gyrations coincidentally came the same week the big 
savings and loan bailout was launched marking the biggest bailout 
ever by the us government 
stock and bond investors largely ignored the signing of the 
legislation by president bush even though critics said the 285 
billion rescue of the nations broke savings amp loans could ripple 
through the economy in the form of unaffordable mortgages lower 
property values and lower interest rates for certificates of 
deposit

northwest airlines earlier this year two other big airlines 
fearing they might be next in line for a takeover strengthened

buffett and american airlines toughened its poison pill

crossovers raised questions about how much longer the walkout could 
be effective

traders on the floor of the new york stock 
exchange cheered when the dow jones industrials average finally 
if only temporarily cracked its alltime high the reaction was 
only half serious 
to the professionals who buy and sell stocks on wall street 
records are fine but arent the pot of gold at the end of the 
rainbow 
traders are glad to see a record because it does hold out the 
promise of a better market which brings more business robert w 
seijas a partner in the nysemember firm lasker stone amp stern 
said after the market closed friday but the record itself 
doesnt hold a lot of magic for the traders 
on friday the widely followed dow jones average of 30 
industrial stocks briefly topped the record high of 272242 set 
aug 25 1987 before finishing down 2864 points at 268399 
it was the second straight day the dow flirted with the alltime 
best on thursday when it broke through the level for the first 
time since before the october 1987 market crash traders cheered 
some facetiously according to floor brokers 
i think most of us are sophisticated enough to know that 
records are only good for the media for the newspapers and 
television it doesnt mean anything to the pros said one 
commission house broker who asked not to be named 
although some broader market indicators have been at record 
levels for days or weeks the dow jones industrials approach to 
the record is considered the final sign of wall streets recovery 
since the oct 19 1987 crash when the dow fell 508 points 
traders said that despite an extended rally that has seen a 25 
percent runup this year the stock market remains tempered by the 
memory of the crash 
its much more cautious now seijas said prior to the 
crash it was getting to be an easy game no one feels like that 
now 
but unlike precrash 1987 inflation isnt rising the dollar is 
up and interest rates have fallen stock prices marketwide are at 
about 13 times corporate earnings compared with about 20 times in 
1987 analysts said indicating that stocks are not overvalued 
statistically speaking all the numbers are pretty good 
said james j maguire chairman of henderson brothers inc another 
member firm all these factors should meld into an environment 
that will be conducive to higher levels of equity prices 
economic news swayed the markets on friday as the labor 
department said wholesale prices slumped 04 percent in july the 
biggest drop in three years and far greater than many economists 
had predicted 
the government also reported that retail sales in july rose a 
healthy 09 percent following two straight monthly declines 
the combination of slowbutsteady economic growth and low 
inflation what economists are calling a soft landing have 
helped strengthen the bond and dollar markets and lent optimism to 
the stock market experts said 
a slowing economy decreases the likelihood that the federal 
reserve will push interest rates higher to help curb inflation 
that is seen as good for corporate profits and for bond prices 
which move inversely to interest rates 
the reports sparked an early rally in the bond market which 
sharply reversed later in the day on speculation that the fed might 
not be inclined to push interest rates lower the yield on the 
bellwether 30year treasury bond finished at 815 percent up from 
thursdays 805 percent 
in addition the dollar surged against major currencies in 
foreign exchange rising to 14190 japanese yen in new york from 
13980 on thursday 
for the brokers and traders streaming out of the new york 
exchange after the closing bell friday the hope of a stronger 
economy means that individual investors who pay higher 
commissions than institutions may be tempted to buy stocks again 
despite the rally individuals have avoided stocks because of 
the crash and better investments in other areas such as money 
markets but as those rates have fallen recently there has been 
some renewed interest in stocks

a number of wouldbe passengers are asking not 
to be booked on flights using dc10 jetliners following two 
explosive engine failures within a month on the jumbo jet several 
agents and carriers say 
since the july 19 crash of a united airlines dc10 in sioux 
city iowa which killed 111 people about 400 customers have asked 
not to be booked on dc10s rob doughty a spokesman for united at 
its chicago headquarters said friday 
doughty said the number compared with the total 150000 
passengers united carries daily 
the mcdonnell douglasbuilt aircraft is used by some 50 airlines 
around the world 
there have been several other incidents involving dc10s since 
the sioux city crash which followed an explosive engine failure 
in one of the latest incidents a northwest airlines dc10 made 
a safe emergency landing thursday in denver after a socalled 
uncontained engine failure in which flying parts punched holes 
in the housing of the airliners tailmounted engine 
us majors american airlines continental airlines delta air 
lines eastern airlines northwest pan am and united fly a total 
of 166 dc10s and about 300 more are flown by foreign carriers 
american the nations largest airline flies 61 dc10s 
followed by united with 55 and northwest with 20 
northwest has worked with about 25 customers who have expressed 
concern about the aircraft said bob gibbons a northwest spokesman 
in eagan minn 
its not indicative of any kind of hysteria he said i 
think most people basically want to be reassured 
as a matter of policy northwest will not allow changes of 
aircraft on discount tickets where any changes normally are 
prohibited gibbons said 
at united nearly all fliers expressing aircraft preferences are 
accommodated unless the only choice on a particular route is the 
dc10 doughty said even requests by passengers with discountfare 
tickets which usually prohibit changes in flight plans are 
being granted he said 
nearly all the worried customers are vacationers and other 
leisure passengers as opposed to seasoned business travelers 
airlines and agents say 
michael edelman an agent at jbs world travel in manhattan 
reported that about a quarter of the agencys customers are 
requesting nondc10 flights 
slowly but surely were getting more requests from people to 
stay off dc10s he said 
other travel agents like william cooper in pompano beach fla 
say theyre seeing more apprehension about air safety in general 
not limited to specific types of aircraft 
that concern has been heigtened by other recent incidents 
involving aging aircraft and other jets said cooper president of 
adventure travels 
on thursday a trump shuttle boeing 727 carrying 56 people 
skidded to a halt in an emergency landing in boston after its nose 
gear failed to extend and on friday a braniff airways flight from 
new york to florida made a safe emergency landing at newark nj 
after a warning light on the 727 indicated a hydraulics problem 
theres obviously some apprehension out there with whats 
happening cooper said he noted that senior citizens and 
families with young children are among his most concerned customers 
in response to questions on thursday federal aviation 
administrator james b busey said regulators had no hard facts to 
prompt a grounding of the nations dc10 fleet
