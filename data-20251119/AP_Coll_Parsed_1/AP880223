three years ago it was hard to turn on the 
radio without hearing joan jett pound it out or madonna whine or 
cyndi lauper tell us that girls just like to have fun women had a 
dominant role in the rock scene 
however at this years grammy awards to be presented on march 
2 at radio city music hall female rockers are an extinct breed 
theres no category as there has been in the past for best rock 
vocal performance female 
the grammys have separate categories for men and women singers 
in pop and rhythm n blues the rock category combines them this 
year tina turner the grandmother of rock who was named best 
female rock vocalist last year is nominated along with richard 
marx bob seger bruce springsteen and joe cocker 
al schlesinger president of the national academy of recording 
arts and sciences said naras has a rule that the 6000 industry 
professionals who are members must nominate 10 different people in 
a category for that category to exist 
the screening committee listens to each nomination and decides 
whether it has been nominated in the right place if it isnt its 
moved to where the committee decides it belongs 
record company executives will always try and enter things in 
smaller categories where theres less competition schlesinger 
said we dont accept that 
if we dont end up with 10 nominations in a category rather 
than having insufficient competition we fold that category into 
another one it doesnt happen often 
another rule which rca executive dennis fine unsuccessfully 
fought this year is that the rock vocal performance nominations 
must be from solo albums lead singers of groups arent eligible 
grace slicks babylon is a rock n roll track and a great 
solo on a starship album unless she does her own solo album its 
not considered a solo fine said it all depends on how a 
record is billed its not fair sade is considered to be a group 
the screening committee eliminated patty smythe and cyndi lauper 
from rock in the past they determined they were pop 
during the decade performers such as tina turner madonna 
cyndi lauper sheena easton laura branigan joan jett pat 
benatar annie lennox chaka khan donna summer debbie harry and 
grace jones took rock in new directions with their strong images 
and hot music 
are these same female rockers and others suddenly in short 
supply the answer to that depends on who you ask bob guccione jr 
thinks there are lots bill graham thinks there are few 
guccione publisher of spin magazine is incensed that the 
female rock vocalist category was eliminated 
this is literally a disservice to both males and females he 
said i think if anything the last year to two years has 
represented the emergence of the female rock superstar it started 
with madonna and its really just blossoming 
my favorite is maria mckee on wheels there were a lot of 
great performances last year grace jones i may not be perfect 
but im perfect for you debbie harrys french kissing in the 
usa madonna is always to be considered my perspective is that 
this past year of all years females performed better on the whole 
than the males 
graham rocks bestknown impresario disagrees it is an 
irony and phenomenon of rock n roll that there have been so few 
women accepted commercially he said i really dont understand 
why other than the fact that the terminology of rock n roll 
sounds more masculine than feminine the music has got a harder 
edge sometimes 
we have to generalize but a young rock n roll male listener 
may have a problem admitting that hes a fan of a female rock n 
roller if his friends are into allmale groups a woman rocker is 
going to have to have that extra edge so that he cant get that 
song out of his head otherwise shell lose 
however in the 60s and early 70s rock fans male and female 
had no trouble following janis joplin and grace slick later 
male fans were just as enthusiastic as female fans at joan jett and 
pat benatar concerts 
but singersongwriter suzanne vega nominated for three grammys 
this year including best pop vocal female agrees with graham 
when rolling stone ran its list of the top 100 rock albums i 
noticed there were only about six women on this list she said 
laura nyro and kate bush have made brilliant albums but they 
cant be considered rock n roll 
rock n roll is an aggressive very male style of singing 
some women fit into it naturally like chrissie hynde and patty 
smythe there are not many women i think who naturally take to 
rock n roll but they do great music i may have closet 
tendencies in that direction but i dont think of myself as a rock 
n roller

on jan 24 when the allied jewish appeal of 
philadelphia mobilized for the years biggest fundraising event 
there was little reason to believe that super sunday would live 
up to its name 
the telephone solicitation campaign came at a disturbing moment 
for many jews in this country they have watched with increasing 
distress and horror as palestinians rioted in israels occupied 
territories and israeli soldiers retaliated with beatings and 
bullets 
half of the money collected on super sunday would go to 
israel are american jews so pained by israels actions that they 
have become disaffected with the jewish state and unwilling to 
make their customary donations 
the answer is no after the last pledge was counted fund 
raisers found they had collected 25 million up 400000 over the 
1986 total 
israel is the jewish homeland the jewish heart no one can 
live without a heart they are rallying around the flag said 
leonard barrack general chairman of the philadelphia aja 
in city after city fund raisers have reached the same 
conclusion in miami the total collected jan 24 was 26 million 
up 1 million from last years figures in cincinnati it was 
360000 up about 50000 in rhode island it was 187167 up 
about 25000 
wanting to see your kids work on a kibbutz wanting to plant 
trees in israel wanting a jewish state these things are not 
affected by political events said steven m cohen a professor 
of sociology at queens college and leading jewish demographer 
but there is no question that many american jews are anguished 
by reports of israeli soldiers beating palestinians burying them 
alive shooting them in street warfare reminiscent of beirut and 
some have spoken out 
as a supporter of israel i am appalled beyond measure by 
the treatment of the rioting palestinians by the jews wrote 
filmmaker woody allen in a recent oped piece in the new york 
times 
i mean fellas are you kidding beatings of people by 
soldiers to make examples of them breaking the hands of men and 
women so they cant throw stones dragging civilians out of their 
houses at random to smash them with sticks in an effort to 
terrorize a population into quiet 
since early december stonethrowing palestinian protesters have 
challenged israels army demanding an end to its occupation of the 
gaza strip and the west bank of the jordan river territories 
seized by israel in its wars with the arabs more than 50 arabs 
have been killed by israelis in the rioting 
time magazine polled american jews last month and found that 57 
percent opposed the use of force and beatings on arabs a 
palestinian homeland was opposed only by a small margin 39 
percent in favor 42 percent opposed 
michael lerner editor of tikkun magazine a selfstyled leftist 
alternative to commentary that is based in oakland calif 
describes the israeli occupation as immoral and stupid 
we did not survive the gas chambers of europe in order to 
become the oppressors of gaza lerner writes in an upcoming 
editorial 
tikkun has been overwhelmed in recent weeks by calls and letters 
from american jews who are outraged by what is happening in the 
middle east lerner said there has been unbelievable change 
he says 
it used to be that the rule was there is no room for 
criticism now the only issue is where do you say it do you say 
it to the press or do you say it to your friends the editor 
says 
that has been a major issue jewish leadership has been divided 
some leaders denounce others who have gone public with their 
criticism those like rabbi alexander schindler the leader of the 
reform movement who described the beatings as an offense to the 
jewish spirit 
the criticism by american jews of israel ive termed it 
despicable said rabbi avi weiss a leader of americans for a 
safe israel he deplores those who criticize from plush living 
rooms in manhattan 
these are not protesters these are rioters who are out there 
with the intent to maim to wound and to murder weiss says 
a newsday poll of new york jews found that 47 percent thought 
american jews should speak out to influence israel and 47 percent 
felt they should keep their views to themselves 
congregants say rabbi jehiel orenstein of congregation beth el 
of south orange and maplewood nj recently took the pulpit to 
discuss the creation of a palestinian state but when a reporter 
asked orenstein to confirm his remarks the rabbi was evasive 
american jews should not be the critics of israel because 
theyre standing on the front lines and were at a distance 
orenstein said 
but orenstein indicated that he was uneasy with the growing 
influence of rabbi meir kahane the americanborn member of the 
knesset who proposes expelling the arabs from israel and its 
occupied territories 
and he recounted that when news of the beatings spread he told 
his congregation it cannot be the policy of israel to break arms 
and legs and pull people from their beds and terrorize them 
some say israel does not deserve the infamy that is coming its 
way 
we cannot give the impression that were satisfied to have 
hands broken says arnold lasker a retired rabbi living in 
margate fla but the breaking of bone which is a horrible 
thing has to be seen in context as a tiny aspect of a decent 
democratic israel 
many agree that the context is missing that the news media 
have distorted events in israel either by exaggerating the force 
applied by the israelis or by neglecting to focus on arab 
provocations 
and there is the question of whether israel should be held to a 
higher standard than other nations even orenstein asks is 
anybody asking the united states to give back texas 
elaine w charny a 52yearold former teacher who lives in the 
philadelphia suburb of jenkintown pa feels that a higher 
standard is justified israel represents a certain bright hope 
and ideal she says 
she says it is the moral responsibility of jews around the 
world to speak out on israeli issues she cringes when she reads 
the headlines these days were all hoping and praying that they 
can find a better way of solving this problem she says 
mrs charny and her husband buy israeli bonds they have visited 
israel three times however saddened by recent events mrs charny 
does not envision a day when israel will lose its appeal 
its an idea she says the idea that its there for all 
of us kind of like a little utopia its just a vision

the south korean press is enjoying a 
broad degree of freedom after years of tough official control but 
opposition quarters maintain it still is manipulated by the 
governments hidden hands 
nevertheless the nations newspapers are reporting and 
commenting more vigorously on politics and other subjects that for 
years had been limited or banned by the government 
presidentelect roh taewoo who takes office feb 25 promises 
to ensure full press freedom and made it a key point in his 
election campaign the government began easing press restrictions 
last summer under pressure from roh 
we have done much and there should be nothing to complain 
about said lee jungbai the assistant cultureinformation 
minister 
journalists agree the government has abandoned most controls on 
the domestic press such as regular visits to newspapers by 
security agents and the issuance of press guidelines that 
dictated what could be reported and in what way 
government reguirements on registration of journalists have been 
dropped and new legislation will end limits on newspapers having 
news bureaus outside their headquarters locations there also will 
be no limits on the number of pages a newspaper can publish 
the ball is in the court of the news media its up to them 
said rep lee minsup a ranking member of rohs democratic justice 
party 
opposition politicians and dissidents contend however that 
much of the press still remains under government control through 
hidden hands 
rep kim taeryong spokesman for the main opposition 
reunification democratic party said no basic changes have been 
made and the press still is no more than a public relations tool of 
the government 
the opposition claims the government exerts behindthescenes 
influence and control ranging from intimidation to patronage and 
bribery they also contend the media is packed with government 
supporters 
rep ahn dongsun spokesman for the opposition party for peace 
and democracy claimed journalists are practicing selfcensorship 
kim taehong secretarygeneral of the dissident council for 
democratic press movement said essentially roh is the same as 
his dictatorial predecessor he would not give in easily we must 
continue to fight for press freedom 
several editors and reporters rejected the opposition charges of 
selfcensorship but said they want to help ensure sound 
political development without endangering social stability 
one senior editor speaking only on condition of anonymity said 
many journalists are cautious because they suspect the true 
intention of the government 
the opposition claims the countrys two networks which are 
stateowned project only a government viewpoint and that opposing 
points of view receive little attention or are distorted 
a korea broadcasting system kbs spokesman lim ungshik 
rejected the oppositions charges 
our news and other programs are fair by any standard he 
said 
lim said kbs has recently started some new programs including 
talk shows to which opposition figures are regularly invited 
government officials say the criticism the networks may end 
after a neutral broadcasting committee is set up in june as 
required by a new law to nominate the heads of the two networks 
some opposition lawmakers will be appointed to serve on the 
committee to ensure fairness 
the government is also preparing to inaugurate in march a new 
press law that would drop a requirement for government approval to 
start new newspapers or periodicals 
seven newspapers have so far applied to start publishing under 
the new law south korea now has 20 national daily newspapers with 
an estimated combined circulation of 12 million 
the first beneficiary of the new law would be a newspaper that 
some 200 dissident journalists plan to publish this spring with 
support from 3300 sponsors including 1000 college professors 
100 lawyers 200 religious leaders and 200 literary figures 
song kunho president of the newspaper the hankyoreh shinmun 
said the project will be started with 5 billion won 68 million 
to be raised through public shares song said 15000 people have so 
far responded contributing about half of the needed money 
song and the other journalists dismissed from their previous 
jobs on grounds of antigovernment activity said their newspaper 
would emphasize human rights and spearhead press freedom 
the influential roman catholic church also has announced it will 
start a newspaper in april and set up a nationwide radio network in 
september 
critics of the government contend the new press law is 
restrictive because it stipulates that new newspapers must use 
certain kinds of presses that cost millions of dollars they 
contend this would keep control of the press in the hands of 
establishment groups

cafe owner yosef weizman said when 
israeli police beat up his arab workers three days ago he 
understood the depth of distrust between jews and arabs after 
months of clashes in the occupied territories 
eli bensimon 38 had learned the lesson a few days earlier 
bensimon a jew was beaten up in an industrial area near tel aviv 
because he said his israeli attackers thought he was an arab 
growing numbers of palestinians who work in and around this 
coastal city of 15 million people are subject to harassment 
primarily by israelis made suspicious by the unprecedented fury and 
violence of arabs opposing israels 20year occupation in the west 
bank and gaza strip 
arab harassment is leading to a climate of fear among 
palestinians and concern among many israelis 
city officials estimate about 40000 arabs work in the tel aviv 
metropolitan area there are also about 10000 arabs with israeli 
citizenship who live in the area 
this incident is of course linked to the unrest in the 
territories police minister chaim barlev said in a statement of 
the beating of weizmans workers 
i am afraid the situation in the territories is having a bad 
influence on the morals and values of the rest of israeli 
society he added 
one of the four beaten arabs 20yearold maysara alijela of 
gaza told the jerusalem post that police entered an apartment 
shared by nine arab workers friday and did not say anything at 
first they just started to hit us with their hands and 
walkietalkies and also kick us 
one policeman said you are smelly arabs you go home throw 
stones at jews and afterward return here to work alijela told 
the daily hadashot 
weizman owner of the shelly cafe in dizengoff center said 
after his workers were beaten he moved them out of their apartment 
into a hotel and promised to find them a new safe place to live 
three of them said no thanks and quit he told the 
associated press the police said they went into the apartment 
because they thought the arabs were organizing something but that 
is ridiculous its just israeli suspicion of arabs 
i guess the police had a right to go into that apartment but 
the way they handled it was very bad i need those workers 
one israeli dalit laub witnessed the beatings when she walked 
past the arabs firstfloor apartment and glanced in the window 
it was really violent but i was afraid to get involved i 
thought of calling the police but they were the police she 
told hadashot 
city hall was reluctant to get involved 
the problem of beating arabs has to be taken care of by the 
police because it is a criminal issue city spokesman shabtai 
sheval told the ap 
he refused to say how many incidents involving arabs were 
reported in tel aviv over the last month 
police said they were investigating and legal action would be 
taken if the allegations were found to be correct police 
spokeswoman shlomit herzberg told the ap 
police also were investigating the incident involving bensimon 
who was beaten senseless and left on a street 
he was driving to work on feb 12 when two israelis flagged him 
down 
i thought they needed help but when i stopped one of them 
shouted heres an arab maniac bensimon told the post i 
said hey guys whats going on im not an arab 
his protestations did no good bensimon saw the license plate 
number of the car as the two sped away but he couldnt pick 
himself up 
an arab worker helped bensimon off the street and he was taken 
to a hospital where his head was stitched 
israeli newspapers reported the first case of harassment about a 
month ago an arab youth said he was picked up on a tel aviv street 
by two men who identified themselves as police taken to a garbage 
dump and beaten 
some harassment has come from arab militants city hall 
spokesman benny cohen said more than 100 arab workers left their 
jobs in tel avivs yermiyahu restaurant district last week after 
their lives and families were threatened if they disobeyed calls 
from palestinian activists to stay home 
there have been cases of alleged discrimination as well one 
palestinian said he was turned away from a popular tel aviv 
discotheque another complained in an israel tv interview he was 
barred for security reasons from taking a small craft flight 
with his two children 
one gazan working in a tel aviv restaurant gave a statement to 
the jerusalem post last week on condition that his name not be 
used he said he was saving money to get married 
but now i get this message saying stop working for the jews 
stop working for the oppressors and i have to make up my mind 
he told the post most of the others have gone they dont want 
anything to happen to them or their families for me it is also 
dangerous

the turban of darshan singh a 
12yearold sikh was half burned from the heat of the mud oven 
where he hid to escape death 
but the killers sikhs themselves yanked him out and he died 
in a burst of gunfire the boy his elder brother and their father 
all died in the courtyard of the village of fattu bheela home of 
2000 sikhs 
it was one more case of sikhs killing sikhs never before in the 
radicals sixyear campaign for an independent homeland have the 
killers turned their guns so relentlessly on people of their own 
minority faith 
of the 283 deaths blamed on sikh militants this year in the 
sikhdominated northern state of punjab at least 169 victims were 
sikhs on friday and saturday 31 people died in attacks at least 
20 of them sikhs 
the militants want the message to go deep that they will not 
only kill those who oppose them but even those who refuse to 
support them said the amritsar district police superintendent 
mohammed izhar alam 
harbhajan kaur darshans mother told of the attack last week 
in the village 18 miles north of amritsar the sikh holy city and 
heart of the radical campaign 
she said she was wounded but because of fear no neighbor came 
to help 
i was laying in my courtyard the whole night bleeding she 
said from her hospital bed 
the sikh campaign began with attacks on hindus indias 
religious majority but a minority in punjab last year most of the 
1000 victims of sikh radicals were hindus 
the radicals allege economic and cultural domination by hindus 
and want an independent homeland for their 16 million people but 
theories vary considerably on sikh guns are now aiming at sikhs 
most of the men killed are either former terrorists or 
harborers and their families who now refuse to give shelter to the 
militants said ss virk deputy director general of the 
paramilitary central reserve police force 
the killers themselves claim all sikh victims are police 
informers or enemies of the 500yearold faith founded as an 
alternative to the beliefs of warring moslems and hindus 
we shed the blood of only enemies not of innocents or passive 
people said giani jagir singh spokesman for the panthic 
committee an umbrella group that controls the sikh movement 
write it down he commanded during an interview in a bare 
windowless room in the sikhs golden temple i have led half a 
dozen attacks myself and in every case we killed only police 
informers 
why are sikh women and children also killed 
have you heard of an old punjabi saying when you grind wheat 
to get flour some millets also get crushed said singh 45 a 
large man with flowing beard 
dewan singh a police detective in amritsar said in most cases 
the killers wipe out all witnesses because they are recognized by 
the victims families in 19 of the 25 cases he analyzed the 
victims knew the killers 
in each of the 19 cases police found halfemptied glasses of 
milk or sarbat sweetened water with lemon which were believed 
served to the assailants 
rarely did the killers have to force their entry dewan singh 
said 
such was the case with the family of darbar kaur 50 in the 
village of khera balachak near kathunangal 
five sikh boys came and asked for my younger son surjeet he 
opened the door and asked his wife to heat up some milk for the 
visitors mrs kaur said 
after a few minutes they fired at surjeet she said 
surjeet her husband another son and a 4yearold granddaughter 
were killed while mrs kaur and her daughterinlaw hid behind a 
bolted kitchen door 
surjeet had been arrested in july for illegally possessing a 
firearm and was believed to be a member of the radical group babbar 
khalsa he was freed on bail jan 1 
he was not a police informer but he was required under bail 
provision to report to the police station once a week said 
kathunangal police officer subba singh so his former associates 
drew the conclusion that surjeet had turned informer 
singh responsible for maintaining order in 70 villages with a 
population of 200000 said surjeet was afraid he might be killed 
but he said the police dont have the resources to protect everyone 
the killers often leave behind a note written on the stationery 
of khalistan the name of their unborn sikh nation the letters 
sometimes even carry reference numbers such as the a159 on one 
left where 12yearold darshan singh died 
they are our death warrants a stands for akal the immortal 
throne of the sikh faith and the police informer to be killed was 
159 on our list explained giani jagir singh the militant 
spokesman 
he left no doubt that more death warrants could be expected 
if any of the men on the hit list die a natural death we will 
consider it as a great insult to our faith he said

and their variants than at any other research facility in the world 
one of williams most significant accomplishments was the 
discovery and isolation of pantothenic acid one of the universal 
vitamins required by all living cells and essential to life 
later he discovered and named folic acid a substance used by every 
cell in the body 
williams wrote a book on biochemical individuality a 
concept that no two people are exactly alike physiologically and

mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms have 
been formulated and explained sufficiently to the soviet people 
and now its time to start taking action moscows top 
economist says 
abel g aganbegyan also said there are painful and difficult 
days ahead for the soviet union under perestroika gorbachevs 
wholesale restructuring of the stagnant economy and that 
bureaucratic opposition to the reforms remains 
aganbegyan the chief economic adviser to the soviet leader and 
an architect of perestroika also said the average soviet family 
has yet to reap its benefits 
a little bit more than two years have elapsed since we started 
the process the initial stage where we are developing our 
concepts making our programs trying to understand whats going 
on what has to be done and a period during which we have to try 
to convince people of the necessity undertaking these new 
changes he said 
this period is now coming to an end we are getting to a much 
more critical stage which is a stage where we have to start taking 
action 
he and several of his colleagues on monday outlined the history 
and pitfalls of perestroika to a conference of economics students 
and faculty at the new school for social research as part of an 
ussoviet academic exchange program 
aganbegyan said the soviet union has only made the first 
steps toward loosening the topheavy central controls that have 
driven the economy since the stalin era and emphasized heavy 
industry over consumer goods 
in fact most families have not really benefited from whats 
been done so far he said through a translator we have to 
accelerate the whole process so as to achieve a breakthrough in the 
next two or three years so that everyone in the country will feel 
he has a stake in the process 
in addition to consumer goods the biggest soviet economic 
failures during the past 15 years were in housing health care 
education and agriculture he said 
to remedy the problems he cited modest increases in 
construction of new apartments and budget increases for education 
and medicine including 30 percent salary increases for teachers 
doctors and some other health care workers he did not say how the 
military budget would be affected 
he also singled out the planned overhaul the machine tool 
industry which will be the basis for the reconstruction of the 
whole manufacturing sector 
in 1985 we were able to replace 31 percent of all our 
machine tools in 1987 9 percent were replaced and by 1990 we 
hope to replace 13 percent of the machine tools yearly 
aganbegyan said this is a painful and difficult process but we 
have to go through it we havent any other alternative 
aganbegyan also cited the policies of khozrachyot or 
selfaccounting that went into effect jan 1 the law gives 
staterun factories and firms more autonomy with more emphasis on 
profits and job performance 
he said factories must go on a completely costaccounting 
basis selffinancing basis and selfadministrating basis 
gorbachevs policies of perestroika have come under a good 
deal of opposition however from the people in the economic 
administrative bureaucracies in moscow and in the soviet unions 
15 republics he said 
we have reduced the staff and fired or eliminated 110000 jobs 
in the central and republican administrative apparatus 
aganbegyan said 
the opposition has not been confined to the bureaucracy said 
another conference participant timur t timofeev 
we cannot say that the whole working class 100 percent is for 
gorbachev said timofeev director of the institute of the 
international labor movement of the soviet academy of sciences 
the new working class the younger generation the 
muchmoreeducated generation is really the leading force the 
dynamic force of perestroika he said 
some soviets are accustomed to the old ways of work 
preferring less pay and less work 
aganbegyan acknowledged that the restructuring at many factories 
and companies in the next 15 to 20 years will throw 16 million of 
people out of work in a nation where the constitution provides 
that everyone shall have a job 
these people will therefore have to be retrained and given 
additional jobs he said special employment offices will be set 
up to retrain them and find them work he said

an administrative law judge was wrong when he 
ruled last year that canon usa inc illegally monopolized the 
domestic market for dry ink used in some office copying machines 
the us international trade commission says 
the commission in a 60 ruling monday overturned judge john j 
mathias and terminated the investigation 
mathias had ruled in november that canon a copy machine giant 
had violated us trade laws by unfairly disparaging independent 
toner distributors aunyx corp a small toner producer based in 
hingham mass had charged that canon representatives were telling 
customers that toner from competitors was pirate merchandise 
itc attorney edwin j madaj jr said an opinion detailing why 
the commission overturned the judges decision will not be 
available for at least several days he declined to outline the 
commissions reasoning 
naturally were very disappointed said lorraine hanley 
vice president for dealer sales at aunyx we dont know why the 
commission voted this way 
canon lawyers argued that corporate representatives did not make 
disparaging remarks about independent competitors and if they did 
it was very minor stuff the kind of competitive talk that is 
normal in any industry where there are competitors said 
washington attorney harvey m applebaum 
we have always said that we would be completely vindicated as 
this case evolved canon usa president fujio mitarai said in a 
statement from corporate headquarters in lake success ny this 
decision makes clear that we were right on the law on the facts 
and in the way we market our products 
aunyx has estimated that the toner market for copiers in 
question is worth about 250 million annually but applebaum said 
that sounds to me very exaggerated 
the companies competed for sale of toner for certain types of 
canon copiers mostly low and mediumvolume office machines 
aunyx president robert langone said last year that canon had 
about 99 percent of that market while aunyx and other independent 
toner dealers take between 20 percent and 50 percent of the toner 
markets of other copying giants like xerox and ibm 
the massachusetts company which once had 85 employees is down 
to fewer than 30 ms hanley said 
bart s fisher an attorney representing aunyx said he would 
appeal the itc ruling to the us circuit court of appeals 
a separate 300 million antitrust suit filed by aunyx against 
canon is pending in us district court in boston

farmers hear a lot about the european economic 
communitys barriers to us agricultural exports but there is a 
brighter side too 
the europeans particularly french consumers are developing as 
an even larger market for us food products 
overall the 12nation bloc took 68 billion of the 279 
billion in us farm exports in the 1987 fiscal year that ended 
last sept 30 up 5 percent from 1986 a further gain to around 7 
billion is expected this year 
despite the increase and prospects for further growth us farm 
exports are still far below the record levels of the early 1980s 
thus every possibility is examined eagerly by usda trade experts 
the eec ranks second only to asia as a regional market for 
american farmers japan with us farm imports of 555 billion 
last year is the largest singlecountry foreign market 
a recent usda report says the time is right for us 
exporters to consider the french food market 
last year france imported 495 million worth of agricultural 
products from the united states up from 435 million in 1986 and 
403 million in 1985 in the heyday of the early 80s france 
bought a peak of 625 million worth of us food and raw 
commodities 
france is the largest country in western europe with a 
population of 55 million and an area of 213000 square miles 
about fourfifths the size of texas says the report by the 
departments economic research service 
changing lifestyles more working women urban rather than 
rural life eating lunch at work and a greater standard of living 
have led to changes in the food habits of the french people 
the report said they are consuming more processed products like 
canned food and precooked dishes 
for example the report said frances per capita consumption of 
fresh vegetables held steady from 1967 to 1982 but the average use 
of frozen vegetables rose from 05 pounds per capita to 66 pounds 
the consumption of canned vegetables jumped to 44 pounds per person 
in 1982 from 249 pounds in 1967 
according to the french food industry association ania there 
have been dramatic changes in consumer spending patterns since 
1960 the report said the associations data show that the 
french buy more pastries cooked and preserved meats cheese ice 
cream cooked dishes confectionery products and nonalcoholic 
beverages as a percentage of their total budget 
meanwhile the report added the share of family spending on 
wine bread fruits and vegetables and butter has decreased 
the analysis prepared by mark d newman and victor h miesel 
jr was included in the current national food review a quarterly 
magazine issued by the usda agency 
american goods compete with agricultural products from other eec 
member countries which are generally admitted freely into france 
however specific products of high quality with unique 
characteristics can find a place on the french market regardless of 
barriers exchange rates and competitive pressures the report 
said

china has bought an addition 405000 metric 
tons of us wheat at subsidized prices for delivery in the 198788 
marketing year according to the agriculture department 
the sales equal to almost 149 million bushels were handled by 
five companies cargill inc 135000 tons nichimen america inc 
35000 bunge corp 35000 continental grain co 100000 and 
artfer inc 100000 
william l davis acting general sales manager for the 
departments foreign agricultural service said monday the sales 
were part of an authorized 12 million tons of wheat announced feb 
5 under the export enhancement program or eep 
although no selling prices or other details were announced 
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around 276 
per bushel indicating a us farm value of about 41 million 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
china bought more than 4 million tons of wheat under previous 
eep arrangements which allow exporters to sell commodities at 
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
davis said the bonuses due the five companies averaged 4038 
per ton or about 110 per bushel of wheat the bonuses will be 
paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the departments 
commodity credit corp 
china has 495000 tons remaining for use under the eep 
initiative announced on feb 5 he said

the government enjoyed a rare budget surplus 
last month because social security checks for january were mailed 
before the new year began 
the treasury department said monday that the surplus between 
government spending and revenues jumped to 1609 billion in 
january a sharp turnaround following a december deficit of 2422 
billion 
both months were influenced by social security the governments 
biggest benefits program the government ended up making two 
payments in december the regular one and the january payment 
which was mailed on dec 31 because of the new years holiday 
in january government revenue totaled 8179 billion down 43 
percent from december government spending was almost half the 
december total dropping to 6571 billion in january compared 
with 10974 billion the month before 
the surplus was the first since september and only the second in 
the past 16 months 
for the first four months of the fiscal year which began oct 
1 the deficit totals 6581 billion down 07 percent from the 
same period in the 1987 fiscal year 
for the first four months of this fiscal year government 
revenues have totaled 28666 billion 55 percent higher than a 
year ago government spending totaled 35246 billion an increase 
of 42 percent over the same period a year ago 
for all of 1988 the reagan administration is projecting the 
budget deficit will fall to 14674 billion down 25 percent from 
last years deficit of 1504 billion 
the congressional budget office using less optimistic 
assumptions about economic growth this year projects a 1988 budget 
deficit of 157 billion substantially above the target of 144 
billion set in the grammrudman deficit reduction law 
president reagan sent congress his budget recommendations for 
1989 last thursday predicting a 1989 deficit of 1295 billion 
the largest spending categories in january were as usual the 
military followed by social security other programs in the 
department of health and human services and interest on the 
national debt 
military spending totaled 1923 billion last month and 9352 
billion for the fiscal year so far up 65 percent from the same 
period a year ago 
spending for social security totaled just 652 million last 
month and 7014 billion for the past four months up 46 percent 
from a year ago 
the other health and human services programs including medicare 
and medicaid spent 5051 billion in january and 4993 billion so 
far this budget year a 11 percent increase over 1987 
interest on the 22 trillion national debt totaled 1467 
billion last month and 7577 billion so far this fiscal year an 
increase of 98 percent over the same period last year 
for the 1988 fiscal year interest payments on the debt are 
expected to total 21006 billion accounting for 20 percent of 
total federal spending

navy secretary james webbs abrupt resignation 
blew the lid off his split with defense secretary frank carlucci 
and revealed bitter infighting at the pentagon as it grapples with 
budget cuts after years of reaganera increases 
webb resigned monday and decided to air some dirty linen on the 
way out accusing carlucci of needlessly sinking the 
administrations dream of building a 600ship fleet 
he further accused carlucci of ordering him to lie about 
internal budget fighting saying the defense chief had written him 
a note saying he should deny news stories reporting it was the 
defense department and not the navy proposing to mothball ships 
now im not going to deny the truth webb said 
this building needs to be led it needs some vision he 
continued if i had a piece of advice to give to secretary 
carlucci it would be to spend a lot more time with the top leaders 
in this building 
hes been spending a lot of time with the state department and 
a lot of time on the capitol hill i think they pentagon 
leaders need to feel his vision and to understand what he believes 
in 
carlucci declined to respond monday issuing a written statement 
saying only that he learned of webbs resignation with regret 
the pentagon added in a separate statement though that if webb 
decided he could not defend the departments decisions on the 
budget then under the circumstances he has done the honorable 
thing 
an administration official who asked not to be identified said 
carlucci was recommending that william l ball iii the assistant 
to the president for legislative affairs be nominated to replace 
webb 
the white house might announce balls nomination today at the 
same time it formally accepts webbs resignation the source said 
the 42yearold webb a highly decorated vietnam combat veteran 
who earlier worked as an assistant defense secretary said he had 
been contemplating resignation for some time but didnt make up his 
mind until sunday 
the final impetus he said was the submission to congress last 
week of the fiscal 1989 pentagon budget carlucci shaped it without 
regard to the advice of the navys top civilian and military 
leadership webb said 
i cannot support the reductions that are in this budget he 
said 
the massive military buildup under president reagan which has 
seen the pentagons budget more than double is coming to a halt 
because of concerns about the huge federal deficits run up during 
the reagan years 
carlucci following up on a deficitreduction agreement reached 
by the white house and congress in december submitted a fiscal 
1989 budget proposal totaling 2995 billion slightly more than 
for fiscal 1988 but unlikely to cover inflation it cuts the navys 
original 1989 spending plan by 123 billion and calls for among 
other things mothballing 16 older frigates 
those ships are at the heart of the dispute that erupted monday 
webb said they didnt have to be retired and that if they were the 
navy could never reach its goal of deploying a 600ship fleet the 
pentagon maintains the navy will end fiscal 1989 with 580 ships and 
can still reach 600 by fiscal 1992 
reagan former defense secretary caspar weinberger and webbs 
predecessor john f lehman all have insisted that the navy needs 
a minimum of 600 warships to satisfy us commitments around the 
world without requiring overly long deployments 
webb in his letter of resignation and in a meeting with 
reporters said he had provided carlucci with three different plans 
for cutting the necessary dollars without mothballing the ships at 
the very least he said the 16 frigates could be transferred to 
the naval reserve at a cost of less than 100 million and stay on 
standby 
in each case the advice of this senior navy leadership 
concurred in by the joint chiefs of staff was ignored webb 
wrote 
i can only conclude that the decision to reduce the level of 
our fleet was motivated by other than military and strategic 
reasoning 
webb declined to say why he thought carlucci had ignored his 
advice 
a ranking pentagon official who asked not to be named however 
said defense department executives for a time eyed the 16 frigates 
as ships that could be offered for sale to portugal at a cut rate 
portugal wasnt interested the source added 
the administration is trying to find ways of increasing military 
assistance to portugal to preserve access to an air base on the 
azores islands 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said secretary 
carlucci is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the 
pentagon to accommodate budgetary reductions secretary webb 
indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints but i 
know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the 
country 
webb who became navy secretary 10 months ago after serving as 
an assistant defense secretary under weinberger is an attorney and 
the author of the bestselling vietnam war novel fields of 
fire he said he probably would return to writing

they call it super tuesday a better name might be 
tarmac tuesday or maybe satellite tuesday 
the tuesday comes in two weeks on march 8 whats super about 
it is that the day will be the closest america has ever come to 
holding a national primary election to select presidential nominees 
democratic and republican nominees may not be decided then but 
the presidential landscape will be altered 
twenty of the 50 states hold primaries or caucuses and they are 
scattered from massachusetts to florida to idaho yet tuesday has a 
distinctly southern flavor fourteen of those 20 states are in the 
south or border regions every state of the south save south 
carolina holds delegate contests that day and the republicans in 
south carolina hold theirs three days earlier 
to campaign across that vast expanse of country the 
presidential candidates have found agreement the only way really 
is for the candidate to wing his way to as many cities as possible 
each day in an effort to get his face and maybe even a few of his 
words on the local television news 
no candidate they reason can buy enough television commercials 
to carry 20 states in a two to threeweek campaign although some 
will try so they aim for the free tv time 
hence tarmac tuesday many of the candidates are seeing no more 
of the states or cities where they campaign than can be viewed from 
the airports where they hold news conferences or more often the 
case from the single event they hold not far from the airport 
then its quickly off to the next event in the next media 
market they are press hits in the jargon of this campaign 
look for a lot of hits that are close to the airports said 
ed reilly a polltaker and strategist for one of the democrats 
richard gephardt you look for your opportunities within 20 
minutes from the airports so you can get back and on to the next 
one 
quick campaign stops are nothing new to presidential campaigns 
but its hardly what the architects of the southern regional 
primary had in mind 
they wanted to take some of the thunder away from iowa and new 
hampshire for all the criticism of those two early states 
candidates do spend a lot of time there and really do meet with 
real voters 
the way it worked out those states may have gotten even more 
attention this time while the south is still waiting to hear about 
its concerns of say rural poverty and development 
but still a better name for this megaprimary reilly says may 
be satellite tuesday 
developments in television technology have played directly to 
the candidates slavish need to get television airtime local tv 
stations now have and use the technology to get live reports 
from from virtually anywhere 
the candidates are trying to exploit that by accommodating 
television stations in the super tuesday states not just by 
tailoring local events but by making farflung campaign appearances 
available via satellite to stations elsewhere 
campaigns may pay to have video pictures of their candidate at 
an apperance beamed up to a satellite where it is available for 
stations that want it even if they didnt have crews on the scene 
we have found in these small markets particularly with 
agriculture stories weve had enormous success getting the 
candidate on the air reilly said 
hence gephardt makes three stops as he flies across three time 
zones one day last week and he walks through a nearly idle 
electronics factory to underscore his attack on unfair trade 
practices with only a halfdozen people to hear him talk 
it was the handful of television cameras there that he had in 
mind 
never mind that the factory was in rapid city sd its one of 
the five states with primaries or caucuses in the three weeks 
before super tuesday but it is a state where the primary is 
meaningless in the allocation of delegates that will come later at 
the state caucus 
what counted was that the gephardt story that day appeared not 
only on south dakota television but on some southern stations too 
it is the old story of television creating a global village 
and it means that the campaigns pick events and locations that 
meld with the point a candidate is trying to make his message for 
the day will be summed up in a 30 second bite on television that 
evening if hes lucky so look for gephardt to go to a texas 
automobile factory and a birmingham ala steel mill to make his 
point about foreign competition and lost jobs 
its supersatellite tuesday reilly said pretty soon the 
secret service will have to start attaching those satellite 
dishes to the limos so these guys can do linkups from the road

there were technical disagreements but no 
acrimony during meetings of scientists that led to the decision to 
reduce power levels at the savannah river plants nuclear reactors 
plant officials said monday 
the washington post reported monday that the power levels were 
reduced by federal officials following a stormy meeting during 
which scientists warned that the reactor was operating beyond the 
demonstrated capacity of its emergency cooling system 
the department of energy officials initially were reluctant to 
order the reduction because they didnt want to admit they had made 
a mistake and risk triggering public pressure to close the south 
carolina facility the newspaper reported citing unidentified 
sources 
the decision was made during a meeting feb 12 to reduce power 
levels at two of the three government reactors at the savannah 
river plant the last energy department facility that produces 
plutonium said roger rollins the departments chief of reactors 
at srp 
rollins described the 10 percent reduction in power the third 
reduction in 14 months as a routine action reflecting a change in 
the way reactor temperatures are measured the reduction dropped 
the operating level from 1100 megawatts thermal to 960 megawatts 
power had been reduced previously from 2200 megawatts 
but the post said its sources said the reduction was ordered 
only at the insistence of scientists working for du pont does 
contractor at savannah river the scientists had discovered a 
fundamental error in the calculations that have been used for 
decades to justify reactor operating levels the newspaper said 
savannah river manager robert l morgan decided to reduce the 
levels following a confrontation with the scientists at a feb 8 
meeting during which a top du pont scientist threw his security 
badge on the table in front of morgan and threatened to go 
public unless the power levels were lowered the sources said 
an unidentified doe official told the post that the department 
did not want to raise the specter of continuing problems at 
savannah river 
rollins denied monday there was a fundamental error in the doe 
calculations and denied there were any heated disagreements during 
either of the meetings feb 8 and feb 12 
there were lots of technical discussion which helped the 
decisionmaking process rollins said there was no dissention 
utilmately everyone agreed with the decision to make the minor 
adjustment

the supreme court will be the setting for a 
crucial constitutional fight this spring when it studies a 
postwatergate law creating special prosecutors to investigate 
highranking government officials 
the justices announced monday they will hear arguments in the 
dispute in april with a decision expected by july 
the eventual ruling will determine the future of courtappointed 
independent counsels it also will affect the criminal conviction 
of former white house aide michael k deaver and the investigation 
of exjustice department official theodore b olson 
deaver prosecuted by an independent counsel was convicted of 
lying to a grand jury and to a house subcommittee that investigated 
his lobbying activities olson is under investigation by an 
independent counsel on charges he lied to congress 
an independent counsels probe of marine lt col oliver l 
north for his role in the irancontra affair is expected to survive 
any adverse high court decision on the law 
the us court of appeals here ruled jan 22 that the law 
improperly grants presidential appointment powers to the federal 
courts and encroaches on the presidents exclusive authority to 
enforce criminal laws 
the law authorizes a special court acting at the attorney 
generals request to appoint the independent counsels 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh received a parallel 
appointment from attorney general edwin meese iii to conduct the 
irancontra investigation that power insulates his office from the 
constitutional attack on the special prosecutor law 
similarly independent counsel james c mckay who successfully 
prosecuted former presidential aide lyn c nofziger on illegal 
lobbying charges also accepted a backup appointment 
but the investigations of deaver and olson were not buttressed 
by such parallel grants of authority from the attorney general 
the case before the supreme court was brought by independent 
counsel alexia morrison she is investigating charges that olson a 
former assistant attorney general lied to congress in 1983 during 
a dispute over the environmental protection agencys cleanup 
program for toxic waste 
the court on monday allowed morrison to resume her investigation 
of olson raising the possibility that grand jury indictments could 
be returned before the high courts ruling 
the appeals court ruling temporarily derailed morrisons 
investigation 
meanwhile the court returned to full strength monday with the 
addition of justice anthony m kennedy to fill a vacancy that had 
lasted eight months 
with kennedy available as a tiebreaking vote if necessary the 
court took the highly unusual step of agreeing to hear a second 
round of arguments in two cases already under study 
in one case involving the death of a marine helicopter 
copilot the justices will decide whether defense contractors may 
be forced to pay damages for onduty accidents involving members of 
the military 
the second case involving the convicted killer of an oklahoma 
policeman deals with the the disqualification of a potential juror 
who said he would vote to impose the death penalty if the accused 
were convicted 
but the court refused to reconsider its 44 decision last 
december striking down an illinois law that could have made 
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teenagers 
the justices rejected a request by illinois officials to restudy 
the law now that kennedy has taken his seat 
in other action the court 
dealt a blow to religious fundamentalists by killing a lawsuit 
challenging the required use of godless textbooks in tennessee 
public schools the justices without a recorded dissenting vote 
left intact a federal appeals court ruling that said it was 
constitutional to require fundamentalist christian children to read 
the objectedto books 
beverly lahaye president of the conservative concerned women 
for america said a dark cloud of religious oppression looms 
over americas schoolhouses today religious tolerance in our 
nations classrooms has been dealt a devastating blow 
agreed to decide whether local governments may impose 
affirmativeaction programs requiring minority participation in 
public works projects the justices will study an invalidated 
richmond va program that set aside 30 percent of the value of 
public works projects for firms at least onehalf owned by 
minorities 
refused to let a fort worth texas hospital withhold the names 
of its blood donors from a woman suing on charges her baby daughter 
contracted aids after receiving transfusions 
said it will hear arguments by coal mining companies and the 
reagan administration aimed at blocking the possible awards of 
billions of dollars in black lung benefits to thousands of 
miners 
agreed to decide whether the national collegiate athletic 
association should be barred from suspending jerry tarkanian as 
basketball coach at the university of nevadalas vegas for alleged 
recruiting violations

former tv evangelist pat robertson is 
borrowing heavily going into the critical super tuesday primaries 
taking out a massive 55 million loan for his presidential 
campaign financial reports show 
robertson ended january with 55 million in the bank but his 
campaign had 6 million in debts as he far outspent any other 
candidate on the super tuesday contests involving 20 states on 
march 8 
rival gop contenders george bush and bob dole on the other 
hand remained in good shape 
bush the overall fundraising leader ended january with 92 
million in cash on hand and 811029 in obligations while dole had 
42 million and 654269 in bills to pay their latest financial 
statements show 
neither had any loans outstanding but the other gop contender 
rep jack kemp of new york took out 750000 in loans to get 
through the iowa and new hampshire contests this month 
among democratic candidates money leader michael dukakis had 
the most cash available 4 million 
besides his loan robertson reported contributions of 13 
million during january his report also listed as receipts the 65 
million in federal matching funds that he applied for but had said 
he might not use 
robertson had said he was philosophically opposed to the public 
financing system and his staff said he would only use matching 
funds if he needed to stay competitive 
robertsons campaign did not return calls monday night to answer 
questions about the loan by far the biggest borrowing of any 
campaign for the 1988 election 
robertson paid off a shortterm loan of 15 million that his 
attorney has said was secured with his matching funds his report 
showed 
the latest financial reports were due at the federal election 
commission on saturday but robertson had not filed his by monday 
aides said it was still being worked on monday and released 
summary pages monday evening however details of the loan were not 
included 
the sizable expenditures on this months iowa and new hampshire 
contests and subsequent spending toward super tuesday are not 
reflected in the new reports which cover the period through jan 
31 
robertson has spent more than any other candidate against the 
overall spending ceiling which is set by election law at 27 
million for the primary season he reported spending 176 million 
against the cap 
bush conversely while raising more money than any other 
candidate has been watching his budget and has spent the least of 
any republican contender against the cap 
he reported spending 107 million against the ceiling compared 
with kemps 128 million and doles 135 million 
robertson also spent the most of any campaign in a single state 
1 million in texas compared with bushs 335743 and doles 
81645 
wealthy campaigns must keep from spending too much early in the 
campaign because they could leave themselves unable to spend money 
on later contests without going over the limit 
on the democratic side none of the candidates approached the 
cap with dukakis spending the most at 78 million 
the massachusetts governor also had the biggest democratic bank 
account at the beginning of this month 4 million with 511789 in 
bills to pay while the next nearest democrat sen al gore jr of 
tennessee had 2 million with 84248 in obligations 
sen paul simon dill borrowed 523674 in january and ended 
the month with a 691069 debt and only 401176 in the bank he 
raised 534259 in contributions for the month 19 million in 
matching funds and 523674 in loans 
rep richard gephardt dmo entered february with 820260 in 
debts and 172477 in cash on hand he collected 212702 in 
contributions and 19 million in matching funds during january 
aides for both gephardt and simon have said that fundraising 
picked up this month and that they have whittled down their debts 
gore had ignored iowa to concentrate on the super tuesday 
states but he raised very little money during the time the other 
candidates were campaigning hard in iowa and new hampshire 
he collected only 180746 in contributions during january in 
addition to the 18 million in matching funds he got his report 
showed 
dukakis raised 804839 in contributions and got 35 million 
matching funds 
democratic contender jesse jackson reported raising 610036 in 
donations plus 598021 in matching funds during january ending 
the month with 509978 in cash on hand and 354881 in obligations 
former colorado sen gary hart ended the month with 615547 in 
cash on hand and 24484 in debts after collecting 70303 in 
contributions and 937325 in matching funds 
kemp continued a handtomouth campaign ending january with a 
debt of 13 million after raising 1 million for the month 
however his political director charlie black said the debt would 
be wiped out when kemps federal mathching funds come in this month 
he insisted the campaign is not in financial trouble saying a 
heavy mail solicitation program and fundraising events are reaping 
about 400000 a week 
dole raised 12 million in contributions for january and got 
56 in matching funds while bush collected 767892 privately and 
got 64 million in matching funds 
most candidates got very large matching fund payments in january 
because that was the first months the money was released and the 
sums were based on the candidates fund raising for all preceding 
months 
candidates can get matching funds from the federal treasury for 
each contribution of 250 or less that they raise in private funds 
the matching fund is supported by the 1 checkoff on individual 
income tax returns

a senior official of the bahamas is angered by 
a state department charge that systemic corruption in his 
government is undermining a combined campaign against illicit drug 
trafficking there 
paul l adderley attorney general of the bahamas also disputed 
recent testimony of an admitted marijuana smuggler that he paid 
prime minister lynden pindling millions of dollars to protect 
operations in the caribbean country 
what offends us the most is the judgment that if it were not 
for corruption and indifference in this country the bahamas would 
not and could not be used as a transit route for the smuggling of 
colombia cocaine and marijuana to south florida adderley told a 
senate hearing monday 
if the corruption and indifference that is perceived were to 
magically disappear the rate of smuggling might not diminish at 
all simply because i regret to say the united states has not put 
the personnel equipment and operating funds into doing what needs 
to be done in the bahamas he said 
he said it was untrue unfair and distorts the real facts to 
suggest that the bahamas is not doing enough to halt the flow of 60 
percent of the cocaine and marijuana that enters the united states 
through his country 
but sen alfonse damato rny said he still might vote to 
deny further us assistance to the bahamas when the senate deals 
with the question of drug interdiction efforts by foreign countries 
in the next few weeks 
we already have too much rhetoric and empty promises 
damato said 
ann b wrobleski assistant secretary of state for international 
narcotics matters combined criticism with praise for the bahamas 
impressive narcotics seizures and cooperation with us authorities 
she said the joint interdiction of 24860 pounds of cocaine and 
1465 tons of marijuana in the bahamas last year was not equaled 
in any other country in the caribbean 
nonetheless she said narcoticsrelated corruption remains a 
serious problem in the bahamas the bahamian government has not 
dealt effectively with systemic corruption which continues to make 
the bahamas attractive to drug traffickers 
damato and sen dennis deconcini dariz questioned adderley 
closely about american marijuana smuggler george barons testimony 
last week at the drug trial of colombian cocaine kingpin carlos 
lehder in jacksonville fla 
baron said he paid pindling 3 million to 5 million from 1979 
to 1981 in exchange for bahamian protection for his activities 
baron also quoted lehder as saying he himself had paid pindling 
200000 a month in bribes 
baron said he once paid pindling 400000 at a gambling casino 
on paradise island in the bahamas in the fall of 1980 which 
adderley said was a totally incredible story an unbelievable 
story 
adderley said he intended to investigate barons allegations 
but he also said that for pindling to accept a bribe in a crowded 
casino would be like the president of the united states taking a 
bribe in atlantic city

prisoner and held until germanys surrender three months later he 
then returned to san antonio his hometown 
at the time of the crash however he was presumed dead by the 
military and his awards were forgotten military officials said 
at a reunion in 1986 gonzales met retired air force col jean 
miller of newport beach calif who led gonzales squadron the 
603rd of the 398th bomb group 
miller told gonzales about the medal and promotion which the 
colonel had recommended at the time and encouraged him to apply 
for them 
the honor that has been bestowed on me today is a high point 
in my life gonzales told about 80 relatives friends and 
military personnel in a 15minute speech 
gonzales and the widow of the american commander who died in the 
crash will travel with others in the 398th to tour the bomber

sen albert gore says democratic presidential 
rival rep richard gephardt has made wholesale changes in dozens 
and dozens of key positions but gephardt claims it is gore who 
has reversed himself on a dozen issues of prime importance 
the bickering between the two democratic hopefuls turned up a 
notch on monday with gephardts campaign laying down a list of what 
it said were 12 major gore position changes 
its hypocrisy said gephardt spokesman mark johnson of 
gores attacks but gore kept up his volleys saying the missouri 
congressman votes one way in congress and is telling the voters 
something different 
the tennessee senator said gephardts whole approach to the 
electorate is in contrast to the approach during his career in the 
congress 
and gore spokeswoman arlie schardt took aim at the gephardt 
campaigns depiction of gore position changes 
its misleading and an almost laughable list schardt said 
it reveals their anxiety about being so deeply in debt and about 
seeing gore surging past them in recent polls 
on the politically explosive issue of abortion gephardts aides 
said gore voted in 1984 for legislation that would have defined a 
fetus as a person from the moment of conception a change in 
the law that has been key goal of the antiabortion movement 
on sunday gore denied voting for such an amendment 
no no i did not gore said on nbcs meet the press 
i have never supported restrictions on the ability of the woman 
to make a choice in having an abortion 
gores staff said the gephardt campaign is describing the vote 
incorrectly they say it was a vote designed to deny the use of 
federal funds for abortion a longtime gore position and not an 
attempt to write the definition of a fetus into the law in such a 
way that would deny women the right to choose abortions 
the gephardt campaign also listed four other times it said gore 
had voted on both sides of the abortion issue in the house and 
senate 
i have not changed my position at all gore said monday 
there is no inconsistency at all 
gephardt has been severely criticized for backing down from his 
strong opposition to abortion a change that came as he was 
planning his bid for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination 
the gephardt sheet also said gore voted for the harkin amendment 
to the agriculture bill in 1985 which gephardt aides said 
contained production controls almost identical to the 
harkingephardt farm bill gore now attacks the harkingephardt 
bill 
gore said monday that the 1985 amendment was the only 
alternative to the reagansponsored farm bill and he said the 
measures are different on sunday gore termed the latest bill 
the worst single idea of campaign 88 
there are ten other issues on which the gephardt campaign said 
gore had flipflopped gore aides said the list misconstrued vote 
after vote 
here are the ten 
balanced budget amendment gephardt statement says gore voted 
against it in the house in 1982 and for it in 1986 in the senate 
nonlethal contra aid gephardt release says gore voted 
against such aid in 1985 but now says he favors it 
mx missile gephardt statement says gore voted for the mx in 
1983 but now says he is against further mx funding 
defense policy gephardt release says gore voted for the 
nuclear freeze in 1983 and was a respected advocate for the 
liberal peace agenda now gephardt campaign says gore 
positioned himself as a defense hawk 
grain embargo against the soviet union gephardt release says 
gore voted against ending the embargo in 1980 but not criticizes 
embargo 
oil import fee gephardt statement says gore voted against it 
in 1980 1985 and 1986 but told texas voters in 1987 he would 
consider one 
grammrudman gephardt release says gore voted for it in the 
senate and then against legislation that would have rewritten the 
law to solve constitutional questions raised by the supreme court 
trade gephardt statement says gore declared himself a 
freetrade purist in 1987 but had previously voted for a 
textile protection bill 
litmus tests gephardt release says gore denounced litmus 
tests of special interest groups but that he pledged to the 
national womens political caucus in august 1987 he would name 
women to 50 percent of his presidential slots 
supreme court gephardt statement says gore quickly came out 
against the appointment of william rehnquist as chief justice but 
that gore was the last senator to announce he would vote against 
the bythendoomed nomination of robert bork to the high court

two independent television stations say jerry 
falwell owes them thousands of dollars from his tv ministry but a 
spokesman for the evangelist says checks are in the mail 
mike liff general manager of wpghtv said he was pulling 
falwells weekly old time gospel hour from the stations 
schedule because of unpaid bills in the neighborhood of 50000 
hes flying around in his private plane and he hasnt paid us 
since october liff said monday 
falwell also owes an undisclosed amount of money to wptttv 
according to general manager chuck hobbs the station which 
carries falwells daily program temporarily dropped the show four 
years ago for nonpayment hobbs said 
oma bradner who handles falwells television accounts for the 
sam k pate advertising agency said late monday a check was mailed 
to both stations on friday he said he didnt know the amount of 
either check but said it was a pretty good bit 
falwells spokesman mark demoss said the checks were delayed 
because audience support for the program in the pittsburgh area 
has been slow for the last few months 
i can understand theyre upset but i would also hope they 
would continue to carry the program demoss said i know they 
made some strong remarks but theyll be glad to know were flying 
around in the private jet a whole lot less this year than last 
liff said hes also bothered by the fact that such shows can be 
an important source of revenue to television evangelists who must 
pay stations to carry their programs because they do not sell 
advertising on them 
we are the vehicle that broadcasts these shows to people who 
send in a whole lot of money possibly at the expense of their own 
wellbeing thats my problem he said 
wpgh continued to run falwells show without being paid 
because we didnt have a viable alternative liff said 
theres very little this station could run at 11 pm on 
sunday night thats going to make us money

republican presidential contender bob dole and 
democrat michael dukakis have invested the most cash in efforts to 
get a boost from the socalled gateway states leading into the 
super tuesday series of primaries financial records show 
these states have been somewhat overshadowed by the 20state 
showdown that will occur on super tuesday but the campaigns 
generally agree that whoever does well in the gateway states will 
have the look of a winner going into the critical march 8 contests 
the gateway contests occurring between now and super tuesdays 
megaprimary on march 8 are in south dakota minnesota maine 
south carolina and wyoming 
dole the senator from kansas spent more than twice as much as 
bush and their republican rival pat robertson in the gateway 
states according to campaign financial statements filed over the 
weekend with the federal election commission 
dukakis leads the democrats in spending for both super tuesday 
and the gateway contests the records show he also had the biggest 
bank account at the beginning of this month 4 million while the 
next nearest democrat sen al gore jr of tennessee had 2 
million 
the new reports reflect spending through the end of january 
while not reflecting the sizeable expenditures this month on the 
iowa and new hampshire contests or the subsequent spending toward 
super tuesday and the gateways 
by the end of january the reports show dole spent a total of 
786529 in the gateway contests compared to bushs 389150 
robertsons 373105 and rep jack kemps 183831 
doles biggest spending was in minnesota 367097 compared to 
bushs 20927 robertsons 75391 and kemps 67994 the state 
holds its caucuses tuesday 
robertson has selected south carolina as his mustwin state and 
had spent 224234 there by the end of january compared to bushs 
126151 doles 110775 and kemps 35681

the state hierarchy of the assemblies of 
god church monday ordered television evangelist jimmy swaggart to 
immediately begin a twoyear rehabilitation period that will limit 
his preaching and place him in counseling an official said 
louisiana district supervisor cecil janway announced the action 
which could be modified by the national organization after more 
than nine hours of meetings with swaggart who was accused of 
sexual miscounduct and admitted sunday to unspecified sins 
the following action has been taken by the board of the 
louisiana district of the assemblies of god concerning evangelist 
jimmy swaggart we accept his confession of specific incidents of a 
moral failure janway said 
based on his detailed confession and the evidence we observed 
of true humility and repentance we have offered him 
rehabilitation in accordance with the bylaws of the general 
council and louisiana district of the assemblies of god he said 
brother swaggart has submitted to the terms of 
rehabilitation he said 
swaggart made no comment as he left the meeting he was whisked 
away by guards and left in a van later flying home to baton rouge 
janway told reporters that swaggart will be prohibited from 
preaching a minimum of three months except in fulfillment of 
present commitments involving foreign governments during that 
period he did not elaborate 
earlier janway had said the regional board would report its 
findings privately to the general council of the countrys largest 
pentecostal denomination based in springfield mo 
he declined to answer questions after reading his statement 
saying no comment when asked if the action announced monday 
would require further action from church officials in missouri 
everett stenhouse assistant general superintendent of the 
denomination said the action will now be referred to the executive 
presbytery in springfield to be approved or sent down for 
modification a march 29 meeting is scheduled but its 
possible for us to meet sooner he said 
national assemblies of god officials had met with swaggart last 
week 
janway said swaggart would be relieved of his duties as 
copastor of the family worship center in baton rouge but he would 
be allowed to return to preaching after three months jim rentz 
copastor with swaggart at the worship center earlier had said he 
would assume duties as chief pastor of the church 
swaggart did not describe his misconduct sunday in his 
confession which drew gasps and tears from his congregation 
an overflow crowd packed his 7500seat family worship center 
after reports that church officials had been given photographs 
purporting to show swaggart and a known prostitute going into and 
out of a motel room 
the evangelist flew here from his headquarters in baton rouge on 
monday for the meeting with the district presbytery of the 
assemblies of god 
in his announcement after that meeting janway said swaggart 
would be counseled and supervised weekly by three members of the 
louisiana district presbytery during the rehabilitation period he 
will be required to submit quarterly and monthly reports to church 
officials janway said 
again no doubt much speculation and rumor will find its way 
into the secular media but for the church the body of christ 
such speculation and rumor has no place he said 
we urge brother swaggart and his associates to resist the 
request of those outside the church to respond to questions 
brother swaggart has been in complete cooperation with the 
assemblies of god and has pledged with work within the structure of 
the church janway said 
the photographs allegedly showing swaggart with a prostitute 
reportedly were given to church officials by new orleans evangelist 
marvin gorman who had once filed a 90 million suit against 
swaggart claiming swaggart had unjustly accused him of numerous 
affairs i know they exist and theyre relevant gormans 
attorney hunter lundy said of the photographs 
the washington post reported monday quoting a source who spoke 
to a jimmy swaggart world ministries board member that swaggart 
said he did not engage in sexual intercourse with the woman but 
paid her to perform pornographic acts 
one church official said swaggart had confessed that his sexual 
misconduct had continued for years 
he tried and tried and tried through prayer and fasting and 
everything he could do to lick it and it beat him the rev glen 
cole pastor of the capital christian center in sacramento calif 
told a sacramento television station on sunday cole is one of 13 
denomination officials that examined swaggarts case last week 
he confessed to specific incidents of moral failure forest 
h hall secretarytreasurer of the assemblies louisiana district 
told swaggarts congregation in the opinion of the officers of 
the louisiana district he has shown true humility and repentance 
and has not tried to blame anyone else for his failure 
the denominations role is limited to disciplining swaggart but 
as in the case of ptl it has no control over the television 
ministry 
eleven months ago swaggart scathingly denounced fellow 
assemblies of god evangelist jim bakker for committing adultery 
comparing him to a cancer that had to be excised 
bakker who resigned from his ptl ministry in march after 
admitting to an extramarital sexual encounter with church secretary 
jessica hahn and being defrocked by the denomination had blamed 
swaggart for bringing his misconduct to light 
swaggart had worked last summer to develop an ethics code for 
broadcast ministries to stem a dropoff in donations caused by the 
sex and money scandal at the ptl ministry under bakkers reign 
with tears streaming down his face swaggart said sunday he was 
stepping down from the pulpit for an undetermined indeterminate 
period of time we will leave that in the hands of the lord 
he said he was cooperating with the assemblies investigation 
i do not plan in any way to whitewash my sin or call it a 
mistake he said i call it sin 
ministry officials had refused to comment on the future of 
swaggarts television program which is videotaped at his regular 
sunday service and distributed in more than 100 countries 
swaggart a cousin of rock n roll pioneer jerry lee lewis and 
country singer mickey gilley combined his singing and piano 
playing with oldfashioned fireandbrimstone preaching to build a 
ministry with an income estimated at 142 million in 1986

democratic presidential contender rep 
richard gephardt is still talking tough on trade despite the 
fading prospects of the trade amendment that bears his name 
i want to turn it in the other direction the missouri 
congressman said as he opened a twoday campaign swing here 
first weve got to change our trade policies so other countries 
treat us like we treat them 
as an example gephardt pointed to the fact a car manufactured 
in south korea can be sold in the united states at a low price 
while tariffs and taxes in south korea would push the cost of a 
midsized american car in south korea to 48000 
gephardt recently made commercials suggesting that south 
koreanmade hyundais sell for 48000 here unless south korea mends 
its ways the commercials coupled with a populist push were 
credited with helping him win the iowa caucuses two weeks ago 
if they bring their products here and sell them with ease i 
want to be able to take our products there and sell them with 
ease he said i will demand equal trade 
he added the united states should not back away from such a 
policy 
why are we selling ourselves short he asked why dont we 
stand up for whats right when we stand up foreign markets open 
up 
gephardt is the author of an amendment to a massive trade bill 
that would call for mandatory sanctions against countries with big 
trade surpluses with the united states if six months of talks fail 
to resolve differences 
but house conferees working on the measure which has been 
languishing have said they will soon scrap the gephardt amendment 
in order to get the measure through one conferee a fellow 
democrat called the provision bad policy 
as a courtesy to their colleague gephardt the trade bill 
negotiators were expected to wait until after the super tuesday 
primaries to give his provision the heaveho 
gephardt also repeated his calls for a national energy policy 
including a fee on imported oil 
we import as much oil today as we did in 1973 he said we 
dont have a courageous leadership or energy policy why dont we 
stand up for america for once and have an energy policy that is 
good for the united states 
on the issue of defense gephardt called for a central 
procurement system for defense purchases and said he favored the 
midgetman over the mx missile

two years ago they were heroes 
idealistic young officers whose mutiny helped spark the revolt 
against ferdinand marcos now they are in disgrace victims of the 
revolution they helped inspire 
on feb 22 1986 the reform the armed forces movement or ram 
a clique of young officers angry over corruption in the marcos 
military mutinied 
their action tapped a groundswell of opposition that began after 
the 1983 assassination of opposition leader benigno aquino and it 
led to a popular revolt backed by clergy and joined by hundreds of 
thousands of civilians 
president marcos fled the country on feb 26 and president 
corazon aquino took office ram leaders such as lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan were hailed as heroes in the finest tradition of 
service to the nation 
but on the second anniversary of what is known as the edsa 
revolution honasan is in detention aboard a navy ship for his 
role in the aug 28 coup attempt that left at least 53 people dead 
and hundreds wounded 
two other ram members navy capt rex robles and air force lt 
col eduardo red kapunan have been detained in connection with 
the nov 13 1986 murder of leftist leader rolando olalia 
officials say three other ram officers are being sought in the 
killing 
late monday on the anniversary of the mutiny military police 
prevented robles from attending a mass organized by honasans wife 
jane to commemorate the ram contribution to marcos downfall he 
was hustled away into a jeep by military police as he headed for 
the church with his wife 
in a broad historical sense the crackdown on this group 
illustrates the continuing cannibalism of the revolution which 
has already gobbled up several of its leading actors wrote 
commentator amando doronila in the manila chronicle 
the political landscape has changed favorably in favor of 
giving a little more stable base for democratic government he 
added but it is not yet time to be confident that stability will 
endure the revolution has not yet run its course it can turn on 
its other leaders 
the series of military coup plots and the strong desire among 
most filipinos for civilian leadership cost the ram faction 
whatever favorable image it once enjoyed among the general 
population 
but other key figures in the antimarcos struggle have also been 
eased out of positions of leadership in the political turmoil of 
the past two years 
chief among them were former defense minister juan ponce enrile 
the ram patron and leader of the military mutiny former executive 
secretary joker arroyo and former finance secretary jaime ongpin 
enrile now a senator was fired nov 23 1986 after the 
government said it foiled a coup plot by officers close to the 
longtime defense chief 
arroyo once mrs aquinos closest adviser was fired last 
september amid charges by the military that he was a communist 
sympathizer a charge the former human rights lawyer vigorously 
denied 
ongpin an industrialist who helped rally the business community 
behind mrs aquino was fired along with arroyo in a cabinet 
shakeup in the wake of the august coup attempt 
he committed suicide three months later and his family said he 
was despondent over the rancor and bitterness within the aquino 
cabinet 
filipino commentators believe the turmoil was due in large part 
to the lack of political consensus within a disparate coalition 
which shared the goal of ousting marcos but differed widely on a 
vision for the countrys future once the longtime strongman was 
gone 
monday enrile released a letter which he said he received from 
honasan to mark the second anniversary of the revolt against marcos 
although there is no real cause for celebration now because 
our aspirations in 1986 have not yet been realized it is well 
worth the time to pray and remember honasan wrote 
i also pray that all of us still share in the elusive dream of 
true reconciliation peace and a better life for our people

the state department says it is concerned by 
the apparent diversion to the soviet union of a us computer 
system which could help determine the best targets for nuclear 
missiles 
officials of the reagan administration confirmed monday that the 
commerce department and customs service were investigating the 
possibility that the computer supposedly destined for yugoslavia 
wound up in soviet union 
were concerned by this apparent diversion and are working 
with yugoslav authorities to determine exactly what happened in the 
specific case said state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley 
according to a report in mondays editions of the washington 
times a los angeles company essex marketing co is under 
investigation for an alleged shipment last december 21 of a 
computer capable of simulating nuclear explosions to an engineering 
college in zagreb yugoslovia 
the newspaper said the computer was shipped to moscow by way of 
belgrade the yugoslav capital and east berlin 
donald creed a spokesman for the commerce department said 
government investigators had uncovered an elaborate scheme to 
divert a hightechnology computer he said it was the first 
diversion that we are aware of concerning yugoslavia 
he declined to discuss details of the case 
us law prohibits export of items with possible military 
application to soviet bloc nations other hightechnology goods may 
only be shipped to those nations with approval of the parisbased 
coordinating committee for multilateral export controls or cocom 
disclosures last year that toshiba machine company of japan had 
exported hightechnology submarine technology to the soviets in 
violation of cocom regulations led to the filing of criminal 
charges against some company officials in tokyo and strong 
denunciations of the sale from us lawmakers 
though communist yugoslavia is not officially aligned with the 
soviet union hightechnology shipments there do not require cocom 
approval 
another commerce department official speaking on the condition 
of anonymity said that the complete computer system was not 
shipped to the soviet union there were some things that were 
ready to go in warehouses that were stopped the official said 
the washington times said the computer made by floating point 
systems of beaverton ore can be used by military planners to 
gauge the impact of nuclear explosions and to help determine 
optimal targets for nuclear missiles 
the newspaper said that floating point was not a target of the 
investigation 
ana marija besker press counselor for the yugoslav embassy 
said we have asked for a clarification from belgrade on this 
report 
but in any case we are responsible partners in technology 
deals she said our laws on these matters are very strict 
in 1986 the administration investigated an alleged attempt to 
divert large shipments of computers and other sensitive equipment 
to the soviet bloc through austria

the united states and soviet union told their 
negotiators monday to draft anticheating and other key provisions 
of a new arms agreement within a month so the treaty can be signed 
this spring 
defense minister dmitri t yazov said the soviets will begin 
withdrawing shorterrange ss12 missiles from east germany and 
czechoslovakia late this month as a display of goodwill the 
missiles must be eliminated under the intermediaterange arms pact 
signed in december 
secretary of state george p shultz reported progress on human 
rights and emigration and professed not the slightest doubt 
that soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will make good on his 
pledge to pull soviet military forces out of afghanistan 
a joint statement said progress was made toward banning chemical 
weapons and verifying nuclear test limits set by unratified 1974 
and 1976 treaties a report by the official news agency tass 
however quoted gorbachev as telling shultz the us stand on a 
chemical weapons ban hampers the working out of an international 
convention 
addressing a news conference about arms negotiations shultz 
said it was extremely important to accelerate work in geneva if 
president reagan and gorbachev are to sign the treaty at their 
fourth summit planned for may or june in moscow 
he spoke after two days of talks with gorbachev and foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze 
shultz said anticheating measures especially were an 
extremely important thing to get nailed down in a pact on 
strategic or longrange nuclear weapons 
shevardnadze told his own news conference later the meetings 
produced headway toward agreement to cut strategic nuclear weapons 
which he said can be accomplished before the summit 
both men said their geneva negotiators were instructed to work 
out the key elements in time for their next meeting march 2223 in 
washington 
shultz left on tuesday for brussels belgium the soviet news 
agency tass said where he was to brief nato allies on his visit 
american officials said they hoped the new instructions would 
speed the negotiations 
its not a breakthrough its not dramatic it may not make a 
headline a senior us official said privately but the sides 
now have established that verification is the name of the game 
shultz said us and soviet negotiators were ordered to prepare 
three documents dealing with 
inspection of the projected 3050 percent reduction in overall 
numbers of longrange bombers missiles and nucleararmed 
submarines 
how the banned weapons can be eliminated or converted into 
other nuclear arms that would remain legal 
agreement in a memorandum of understanding to exchange 
information about strategic weapons as another way to prevent 
cheating 
according to the secretary negotiators will try to resolve 
some misunderstandings about the us program to develop a 
defense system in space the soviets contend some tests 
contemplated in the star wars program would violate the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
yazov said at an anniversary ceremony for the soviet army and 
navy the soviet missiles and launchers that are going to be 
withdrawn will be sent immediately to the sites where it is planned 
to liquidate them after the ratification of the treaty gorbachev 
and shevardnadze were in the audience 
east germanys official news agency adn reported last week that 
soviet ss12s in waren northwest of berlin had been dismantled put 
in crates and were ready for transport back to the soviet union 
shultz told his news conference a series of human rights 
meetings was agreed upon the first to set for march 16 jurists 
psychiatrists and other experts will attend shultz said but he 
did not announce where it would be held 
the secretary who gave human rights the pride of place on 
his agenda here said shevardnadze promisedflexibility in rules 
that require applicants for emigration to have close relatives 
abroad 
that has been straightened out at least for the balance of 
this year he told reporters adding that shevardnadze told him 
categorically the only barrier to emigration is past work 
involving state secrets 
kremlin officials have given such assurances before shultz said 
the sides still were exploring the point at which involvement 
in classified work would cease to count against an applicant 
after asserting belief in gorbachevs intentions about 
afghanistan shultz said of withdrawal the question is how and 
that is what the negotiations are about 
his reference was to unsponsored talks between afghanistan 
and pakistan that resume next week in geneva key issues remaining 
are a timetable for the pullout and whether an interim government 
should be in place while it occurs 
gorbachev offered to begin the the withdrawal may 15 and 
complete it within 10 months if agreement is reached in geneva by 
march 15 shultz said he wants the estimated 115000 troops out by 
the end of the year and i think there is a very good chance of 
that happening 
soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 and 
remained to help the communist government fight moslem insurgents

here is the text of a memo from lawyer e 
robert wallach to attorney general edwin meese iii on a proposed 
iraqi pipeline 
memo to emiii 
from erw 
date 25 september 1985 
personal amp confidential for your eyes only 
i hesitate to provide the following information to you in 
memorandum form im constantly torn between my own feelings of 
privacy and the need to provide you with information in a form 
which will expedite communication the following are specific items 
of information which br bruce rappaport provided to me 
1 when edgar bronfmann met with gorbachev in moscow he was 
advised to transmit a message to peres to the effect that they 
would be willing to allow the flow of soviet jews to israel only 
you may recall my memo quite awhile ago in which i expressed to 
you my own frustration at the conflict between us american jews 
and the state of israel which occurred in vienna at that juncture 
point there was a competition and most of the soviet jews 
especially the best trained and younger were coming to the us i 
said at that time that this provided an excellent rationale for the 
soviets to restrict the immigration in addition apparently 
mitterand has offered the services of air france to the soviets for 
the purpose of emigration 
2 br has been financing private polls for quite a long time 
in israel on behalf of laborperes they demonstrate an increasing 
strength for labor and the high probability of elections no later 
than march 1986 
3 he confirmed the arrangement with peres to the effect that 
israel will receive somewhere between 6570 million a year for 
ten years out of the conclusion of the project what was also 
indicated to me and which would be denied everywhere is that a 
portion of those funds will go directly to labor 
for both this information and the emigration above the obvious 
rationale needs to be kept well in mind there is a need to provide 
israel with an increasing flow of ashkenazy jews from the soviet 
union to help balance the influx of sephardicoriental jews who 
have a natural affinity and affiliation with likud from the 
standpoint of american interests the advantage is evident 
4 br indicates that peres emphatically indicated that the 
release of weir was as a result of the efforts of the state of 
israel and no one else he indicated that they would also arrange 
for the release of the remaining six there is a feeling that the 
us owes and that the accomplishment of this project as 
outlined in my memo is appropriate it should be emphasized that 
things are seen in a totality of the relationship but that in this 
istance they are uncertain and a bit frustrated as to why the 
usg has not more directly facilitated the accomplishment of this 
project when it is so obviously in the interest of everyone 
involved 
5 there is to be a opic meeting in vienna october 6 br 
intends to send his representative former minister of energy 
calderon of venezuela who is now a member of his board of 
directors and an employee to vienna to meet with minister taki 
the iraqi who is in charge of their oil entity see my previous 
memo apparently these men know each other very well at that 
time bruce intends to comunicate to iraq through calderon the 
private banking proposal which he is prepared to put together which 
would provide funds to iraq as indicated in my previous memorandum 
6 the prime minister is very sensitive to the letter which he 
sent he wants it returned if theres not going to be some kind of 
appropriate response when he comes to washington that appropriate 
response would clearly be a meeting with the president and with bud 
mcfarlane which would include this project as you saw from the 
letter he also includes secretary of state schultz and i have 
expressed myself as to whether or not that is appropriate in any 
event they apparently find it hard to understand why mcfarlane is 
not able to comunicate to iraq and to sh the importance of this 
project 
nb i have explained to them the reluctance to become involved 
in the promotion of a private venture of course they dont see it 
in that light but rather in the total context of the geopolitics 
of the middle east 
7 there was a suggestion that i call the pm of the middle 
country to see what is happening and see if i could prod him along 
i indicated i did not think that was appropriate at this moment i 
also told him that i had had a brief and private conversation with 
bill casey and had invited me to meet with him in a nondiscussion 
the trip to geneva intervened

here is the text of the letter submitted to 
president reagan on monday by navy secretary james h webb 
disclosing his decision to resign 
dear mr president 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
over the past three months the department of defense has been 
struggling to implement a mandated 33 billion reduction of the 
fiscal year 1989 budget approved by you last year the navy 
department was directed to absorb a significant share of this 
reduction which eventually became approximately 12 billion 
like many others i have serious concerns regarding the entire 
budget reduction process first the department of defense has been 
required to absorb cuts at a ratio almost twice as great as 
nondefense programs second many defense reductions themselves 
have been made in the wrong areas and without clear strategic 
thought i am particularly upset with the nature of the cuts as 
they affect the department under my authority 
on three separate occasions the uniformed and civilian 
leadership of the navy department provided the secretary of defense 
with proposed cuts totaling the amount required to meet the budget 
reduction but which also would preserve the cherished goal of your 
administration to rebuild our navy to a minimum level of 600 ships 
in each case the advice of this senior leadership concurred in 
by the joint chiefs of staff was ignored i can only conclude that 
the decision to reduce the level of our fleet to a point that it 
may never reach the 600ship goal was motivated by other than 
military and strategic reasoning 
during the four years i have served in your administration i 
have repeatedly expressed my gratitude at your decision to rebuild 
the greatest navy in the world since i became secretary of the 
navy last year i have stated just as frequently my belief that the 
force levels of our sea services remain minimal and must not be 
reduced 
even in the current budget environment such force levels could 
have been maintained since recommendations to that effect were 
rejected by your secretary of defense i am unable to support him 
personally or to defend this amended budget during budget 
deliberations consequently i find it necessary to resign from my 
position as secretary of the navy 
thank you for the opportunity to have served our country during 
four of our nations most critical and productive years 
respectfully yours

in james h webbs bestselling novel fields 
of fire a vietnam war lieutenant ponders the dignity of men 
engaged in battle and remarks it was the fight not the cause 
that mattered 
for webb who resigned monday after only 10 months as secretary 
of the navy there was always a fight or controversy from his 
criticism of the service academies admission of women in 1979 to 
his lashing out at defense secretary frank c carlucci as he did 
on his final day on the job 
this building the pentagon needs to be led the 
42yearold webb told reporters as he announced his departure it 
needs leadership it needs some vision im saying that if i had a 
piece of advice to give to secretary carlucci it would be to spend 
a lot more time with the top leaders in this building 
furor has dogged webb almost from the day he was sworn in as 
navy secretary on april 9 1987 
five days after the ceremony webb reversed a decision of his 
predecessor john f lehman and ruled that the navy would no 
longer make special accomodations for officers who wanted to play 
professional sports 
ensign napoleon mccallums weekend career with the national 
football leagues los angeles raiders thus ended and 7foot1 
midshipman david robinsons eventual start in the national 
basketball association was delayed 
in the same month webb reversed a lehman decision to dismiss a 
board of admirals and rejected its promotion recommendations 
lehman charged the board had improperly tried to promote nuclear 
submariners at the expense of aviation and surface warfare 
webb took over the post of overseeing about 584000 navy 
personnel and approximately 199000 marines amid a sea of problems 
including sex scandals that had rocked the marine corps debate 
over the size of us forces in the persian gulf and the role of 
marine lt col oliver north in the irancontra affair 
north was all too familiar to webb during their student days at 
the us naval academy they fought for the brigade boxing 
championship north won 
a native of st joseph mo webb served in the pentagon as the 
assistant secretary for reserve affairs on may 3 1984 he was 
about to quit that job when then defense secretary caspar 
weinberger made an offer he couldnt resist the job as secretary 
of the navy 
webb had served previsously on the republican staff of the the 
committee on veterans affairs of the house of representatives 
a 1968 graduate of the naval academy webb served with the 5th 
marine regiment in vietnam as rifle platoon leader and company 
commander earning the navy cross the silver star two bronze star 
medals for valor and two purple hearts 
after the war he left the marine corps and earned a law degree 
from the georgetown university law center where he won the horan 
competition for excellence in legal writing 
webb once said in my mind i am a writer in my heart i am a 
soldier and i always will be 
webb wrote three novels including fields of fire a sense 
of honor and a country such as this and a nonfiction book 
on military strategy micronesia and us pacific strategy a 
blueprint for the 1980s 
but an article for washingtonian magazine women cant 
fight was his most controversial piece of writing haunting him 
during his senate confirmation hearings for the navys top job in 
the article webb wrote that women are ruining the military 
academies by poisoning their ability to train men for combat 
webb reiterated his opposition to committing women to combat 
during the hearings but said he had accepted the change in the 
academies 
in fact last june webb ordered the navy to allow female 
technicians aboard submarines for sea trials to test new equipment 
in announcing the decision webb said the policy will reinforce 
the department of navys equal employment opportunity objectives of 
full integration of women into the civilian work force

with the proposed 1 billion iraqi pipeline project 
dear mr meese 
i am following with great interest the projected pipeline 
from iraq to jordan as a possible additive to introduce economic 
consideration to this troubled land apparently a israeli guarantee

demanded on our part 
i shall be in the usa in the middle of october and i intend to 
talk it over with george shultz for whom i have the highest regard 
considering the short while of my staying in washington i 
believe it may be of great help if george will be informed ahead 
of time

asked my friend bruce and bob to let you know the whole story and 
i shall depend on your judgment about the best way to handle this

of children with aids in the united states were born to mothers who 
are drug abusers themselves or sexual partners of drug abusers

state and local government workers received 
annual pay raises last year averaging 49 percent under collective 
bargaining contracts with public employee unions according to the 
labor department 
the pay increases were below the average 57 percent raises 
received by he same employees in 1986 but the workers still fared 
better last year than federal employees who got a 3 percent pay 
increase and private sector workers whose wages rose an average 33 
percent the department said monday 
however the bureau of labor statistics noted that union 
contracts in the public and private sectors differ significantly 
state and local governments for example tend to have a higher 
proportion of professional and whitecollar workers union 
contracts in the private sector on the other hand often include 
lumpsum bonuses and costofliving adjustments excluded from the 
wage calculations and usually absent in the public sector 
the figures showed that local government workers with wage 
increases averaging 53 percent outpaced state employees workers 
with an average 43 percent raise

american flag stood before the pale marble columns and took his 
seat at the end of the row of nine justices that seat on the far 
right as spectators face the court is the traditional place for 
the high courts newest member 
the former appellate judge from sacramento calif a man with a 
reputation for being deliberative and well prepared didnt say a

question 
kennedys presence brought the court to full strength for the

the producer of jeopardy has 
apologized to mayor joseph e steineger jr because a question on 
the television game show referred to the city as a suburb of kansas 
city mo 
but producer george vosburgh stopped short of conceding an error 
we are taking kansas city kansas out of our definition of a 
suburb said vosburgh who sent a written apology to the mayor 
last week 
we are not necessarily incorrect we just will not refer 
to it that way in the future 
the show intends to clear up the matter and other recent 
misunderstandings with an oops category in a future show 
after hearing about the reference to his city on a december 
show steineger wrote an indignant letter to the producer saying 
kansas city kan was a city in its own right 
steineger said he was satisfied though still somewhat miffed 
i guess when the mayor said they were wrong they were 
wrong he said we certainly like to be recognized as our own 
city

the american medical association stressing that 
it opposes euthanasia says first amendment rights should outweigh 
an order that it identify the author of a mercykilling essay 
citing the us constitution and a state freepress law the ama 
filed a motion monday in cook county circuit court to quash a 
subpoena from the states attorneys office seeking the authors 
name 
the essay titled its over debbie was written by a 
resident physician who described injecting a fatal dose of morphine 
into a 20yearold woman dying of ovarian cancer it was published 
in the journal of the american medical associations jan 8 edition 
jamas confidential sources are protected by the first 
amendment and by the illinois reporters privilege act ama 
general counsel kirk johnson wrote in a statement accompanying the 
motion 
as described in our motion the debate and controversy which 
the publication has generated is exactly what the first amendment 
is all about 
the ama supports the privilege asserted by dr george 
lundberg the journals editorinchief to protect jamas 
confidential sources not withstanding that the ama opposes the 
practice of euthanasia and that ama believes the action described 
in the essay in unethical johnson wrote 
physicians and their organizations also have an ethical duty 
however embodied in the hippocratic oath to teach education and 
inform their fellow physicians he wrote it is to fulfill this 
latter obligation that the ama publishes jama and gives it 
editorial independence 
attorney newton minow a former chairman of the federal 
communications commission who is helping johnson represent the ama 
said he did not know whether the essays author was aware of the 
controversy 
lundberg has said he published the essay to spark debate over 
the issue of mercy killing 
i expected a major reaction but i didnt realize the extent 
to which the country was ready for an extraordinary response 
lundberg said 
we have clearly touched many raw nerves and many people have 
been thinking about many of the diverse issues involved 
he has said he believes the essay describes an actual event but 
on monday he said the account does have enough vagueness to 
welcome critical analysis as to whether it happened or happened in 
this way 
officials in the states attorneys office have repeatedly 
declined to discuss the matter as is routine during a continuing 
investigation 
were not confirming or denying that were even looking into 
this spokesman terry levin said monday 
johnson said a subpoena was served a week ago today

the creators of a minicow produced 
near this northern town through crossbreeding and genetic 
engineering claim the smaller species can revolutionize cattle and 
milk production in the third world 
the 27 animals grazing on a ranch at nearby tanleon are the 
product of 18 years and six generations of genetic manipulation 
the smaller versions of the oxlike brazilian zebu or brahma 
species stand 3 feet and weigh 300 pounds 
the experimenters began with a small pair of zebu that weighed 
more than a ton each and stood nearly 5 feet tall 
each generation has become about eight inches shorter than the 
one before it says angel castrillon the local rancher who has 
conducted the minicow experiment since its start we have created 
a genetic work that produces almost the same quantity of milk as a 
normal cow occupies much less space and uses fewer resources he 
told a visitor 
people working on the project believe the mincows will enable 
many densely populated landpoor countries to start or upgrade 
their cattle industries 
ten minicows can graze on less than three acres of land the 
area one normal cow generally requires those 10 minicows produce 
2970 pounds of meat about 330 pounds more than the one big cow 
would 
horses and other animals have been reduced in size in other 
parts of the world castrillon said but he said what surprised 
us was that the minicows are producing three of four liters about 
one gallon of milk a day compared to the six liters about 15 
gallons that a normal cow produces 
castrillon whose ranch is in the fertile huasteca region of 
north central mexico first proposed the idea to manuel berruecos 
a geneticist at the national autonomous university of mexico at a 
mexico city conference 
the rancher said he suggested doing the opposite of what animal 
breeders traditionally do instead of producing bigger and heavier 
specimens why not make them smaller on the model of the bonsai 
trees in japanese gardens 
unfortunately we have the theory and the prejudice that the 
bigger things are the better berruecos said in an interview in 
mexico city we want to make everything bigger but the world 
isnt growing our project may seem like science fiction but we 
are close to a world that perhaps will have to adopt these types 
of measures 
to achieve the smaller species experimenters selected 
prospective breeding candidates with small heads and crossbred to 
achieve smaller offspring 
in the laboratory berruecos works to weaken and eventually 
eliminate altogether largegrowth genes in the herds semen 
berruecos who holds a doctorate from the university of north 
carolina claims that in terms of quality our experience shows 
no difference in the milk or the meat 
field specialists from west germany japan and the united states 
are watching the experiments with interest in fact castrillon 
said one american offered 1 million to take over the research an 
offer he said he rejected 
castrillons ranch is home to 15 adult minicows and a dozen 
offspring another three are under care of the veterinary faculty 
at the national university 
the minicows are gentle but also very strong they come close 
to you and strongly nudge your legs said anabella castrillon 
the ranchers wife 
the researchers next step 
were planning to cross the tiny zebus with the jersey type 
which is small and the best milk producer castrillon said 
he said he will continue crossbreeding until he produces the 
tiniest possible species with maximum productive efficiency 
were thinking that this species would be about 2 feet tall

religious broadcasters who lost financial support following last 
years scandals and controversy face another potentially hard blow 
from the rev jimmy swaggarts confession of sexual misconduct 
my feeling is that there will be more damage and the 
credibility of those of us in christian broadcasting will be hurt a 
little bit more jerry rose president of national religious 
broadcasters said monday 
this is not what we are about and we have spent an inordinate 
amount of time dealing with these issues said rose who operates 
religious station wcfctv in chicago 
swaggart among the nations most widely watched television 
preachers stepped down from his pulpit sunday after confessing he 
had sinned against god and his family 
officials with his church the assemblies of god said he had 
admitted to a long history of sexual problems and would be 
prohibited from preaching for a minimum of three months while he 
undergoes rehabilitation 
mark demoss a spokesman for the rev jerry falwell judged the 
damage to television ministries to be survivable 
i look at the example of a gary hart moral failure that did 
not ruin the democratic party or other democratic candidates but 
it did ruin gary hart demoss said 
it didnt work that way a year ago some of the big ministries 
including swaggarts bled from the wounds inflicted by jim 
bakkers adultery and high living in the ptl ministry and oral 
roberts doordie appeal for 8 million 
in the aftermath no one sounded more cynical and disillusioned 
than swaggart you can stay more holy a lot of times watching 
miami vice than watching socalled christian television he 
said in one of his rousing sermons a year ago 
a lot of people saw jimmy as a pacesetter for doing what 
needed to be done in the church so in this case it is shocking 
rose said 
the rev james robison a tv evangelist who is seen on about 150 
stations around the country said the fear of criticism from 
swaggart and other preachers may have led bakker to hide his own 
problem rather than address it 
jim bakker told me himself he said i wanted help but i was 
so afraid of what would be said robison said early today on 
abcs nightline 
at cbn whose operations include the christian broadcasting 
network and cbn university spokesman benton miller declined to 
speculate on the impact from swaggarts problems 
last year however he said contributions to cbn dropped 325 
percent from april to october and have remained flat when cbn cut 
nearly 500 employees last summer founder pat robertson blamed the 
controversies surrounding bakker and roberts 
roberts based in tulsa okla had said that god might call 
me home if he didnt raise 8 million by the end of march the 
month of bakkers confession and resignation from ptl cbns fiscal 
year started april 1 
we had to take the whole hit of that plus the change in the 
talent mix for the 700 club plus the drop in oil prices plus 
the recent october stock market plunge miller said monday all 
four of those factors hit us all at once 
the change in the talent mix involved robertsons departure from 
the broadcast to seek the republican presidential nomination and 
the resignation of cohost ben kinchlow cbn cut 145 more employees 
in november leaving a workforce of 1174 though it has also 
managed to expand its television programming and launch a radio 
service miller said 
demoss said contributions to falwells ministry had rebounded 
but on monday wpghtv in pittsburgh announced it was dropping 
falwells program because he was 50000 in arrears 
oma bradner who handles falwells television accounts said 
late monday a check was mailed on friday 
swaggart had a larger audience 1720000 households per week 
last november than any other video evangelist according to the 
arbitron rating service the ac nielsen co put swaggarts 
audience at 860000 households second to robert schullers 
audience of 1189000 for the hour of power but nielsen said 
swaggart was seen on the most stations 286 
arbitron reported that swaggarts audience had been 2161000 
households last february before the ptl and roberts controversies 
between february and november arbitron said schullers audience 
dropped from 17 million households to 14 million roberts from 
115 million to 900000 and falwells old time gospel hour 
from 616000 to 495000 
those figures are for broadcast audience only most programs 
reach additional viewers on cable television 
rose said swaggarts weekly broadcast would remain on his 
station at least until he sees what assemblies of god leaders 
decide to do

house prosecutors for gov evan mechams 
impeachment trial have submitted a list of 41 potential witnesses 
including the governor and his brother willard 
but mechams attorney murray miller wrote a letter monday saying 
he does not want to provide a witness list or to turn over any 
documentation yet 
in a letter to chief justice frank gordon who will preside over 
the trial thats scheduled to begin monday miller said mecham 
believes that holding the senate trial before his criminal trial 
would violate his constitutional rights 
he therefore does not wish to turn over any documentation or 
witnesses that he may call in his defense at this time miller 
said 
the governors lawyer has indicated that he may go to court in 
an effort to get the senate trial delayed until after the criminal 
trial on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan that trial 
was delayed on monday until march 22 
the house impeached mecham on feb 5 and accused him of hiding 
the 350000 loan misusing 80000 from the governors protocol 
fund by loaning it to his auto dealership and trying to thwart an 
investigation of an alleged death threat 
the witness list submitted monday by the prosecution included 
many people who appeared before the house select committee on 
impeachment including state department of public safety director 
ralph milstead and mecham campaign fundraiser bill long 
also in the new list were people who did not testify before the 
house panel including tempe developer barry wolfson who provided 
the governors 350000 campaign loan wolfson was subpoenaed on 
monday to provide documents and testify before the senate 
mecham also was subpoenaed on monday to provide documents 
according to house attorney paul eckstein 
also on the list were donna carlson the former mecham aide who 
was the subject of the alleged death threat and former state 
official lee watkins who is accused of making the threat 
the list included an unidentified polygrapher who performed a 
liedetector test on watkins to determine if he actually made the 
threat 
all sides are scheduled to meet in a pretrial conference friday

smokefree workplaces are becoming more 
common as employers listen to their workers health concerns 
according to a survey 
the injurious effects of passive smoking have been 
wellpublicized and people object to working in that kind of 
environment said victor lindquist author of the 42nd annual 
northwestern university lindquistendicott report 
it seems to me that organizations are really trying to bend 
over to be accomodating to the nonsmoker there also were more 
firms spending money to help their employees stop smoking 
lindquist said monday 
his survey of 226 large and midsized companies found 70 percent 
restrict or are preparing to limit smoking in the workplace 
onthejob restrictions included permitting smoking only in 
designated areas segregating workers into smoking and nonsmoking 
areas and equipping smokers with smokeless ashtrays 
i was really surprised at the extent to which this had 
surfaced as a personnel issue said lindquist said today 
smoking is pretty passe 
lindquist said it was the first year he had asked companies 
about smoking policies in the survey which began in 1945 and is 
used by thousands of corporations to establish starting salaries 
for college graduates and review personnel trends 
the 1988 questionnaire drew responses from a crosssection of 
major industrial and geographic sectors lindquist declined to 
identify any of the companies 
in addition to the smoking regulations the survey found 
38 percent of companies conduct preemployment testing for 
drug use and 8 percent said they would begin such testing in the 
next year 
22 percent plan to begin preemployment testing for exposure 
to the aids virus by the end of the year 
1 percent said they will begin preemployment genetic testing 
to screen for possible diseases 
66 percent said they provide guaranteed reinstatement to 
employees who take parental leave after having a child and 20 
percent provide payroll services that allow employees to have money 
deducted from paychecks that is designated to pay for day care and 
is taxfree 
usg corp a chicagobased maker of acoustical ceiling tile and 
thermal insulation drew national headlines a year ago when it 
warned its 1300 workers to quit smoking at work and at home or 
face possible firing 
the survey found only one company that had completely banned 
onthejob smoking but several prohibited smoking in the private 
offices of corporate executives said lindquist northwesterns 
director of placement 
although 70 percent restricted smoking or were planning to do 
so just 34 percent said they discussed that policy with job 
applicants during interviews he said 
walker merryman vice president of the tobacco institute a 
washingtonbased lobbying group for the industry said he couldnt 
comment on the surveys findings without details about the types 
locations and identities of the companies surveyed 
but he said the 70 percent finding is substantially higher 
than anything ive seen recently 
for example merryman said he had seen a recent scientific 
randomsample survey of businesses nationwide that found 36 percent 
with policies on smoking

the sex scandals surrounding two 
prominent assemblies of god ministers should not taint the more 
than 30000 others in the church of whom only a tiny number are 
ever disciplined an official says 
the evangelical church which counts more than 16 million 
adherents worldwide and operates four colleges is investigating 
the misconduct of its most popular television preacher louisiana 
evangelist jimmy swaggart 
on monday a day after swaggart temporarily stepped down from 
his pulpit church officials said he had admitted to a long history 
of sexual misconduct and would be prohibited from preaching for a 
minimum of three months while he undergoes rehabilitation 
another prominent television evangelist the ptls jim bakker 
lost his assemblies of god credentials last year amid charges of 
sexual misconduct swaggart was said to have been active in 
uncovering that scandal and bakker accused him of plotting to take 
over ptl 
those are the only two in our whole denomination that have 
that kind of recognition church spokeswoman juleen turnage said 
monday so people may feel that this is indicative of the 
assemblies of god denomination and that is not true 
we have over 30000 credentialed ministers in the assemblies 
of god in the united states at any given time any given year 
fewer than onehalf of 1 percent are ever called into discipline 
mrs turnage said 12 areas of misconduct ranging from doctrinal 
aberrations to moral failure call for disciplinary action 
swaggarts suspension and twoyear rehabilitation program must 
be approved by the churchs executive presbytery in springfield 
according to the churchs bylaws she said 
swaggart appeared before his congregation in baton rouge la 
on sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an act 
he did not describe publicly he said he would not return to his 
pulpit until the church investigation was completed

here is the text of a statement monday 
night by cecil janway district superintendent of the assemblies of 
god about the discipline recommended for evangelist jimmy swaggart 
we accept his confession of specific incidents of a moral 
failure based on this detailed confession and the evidence we 
observed of true humility and repentance we have offered him 
rehabilitation in accordance with the bylaws of the general council 
and louisiana district of the assemblies of god 
brother swaggart has submitted to the terms of rehabilitation as 
follows 
1 brother swaggart will begin a twoyear rehabilitation period 
effective immediately 
2 brother swaggart will be required to refrain from preaching 
for a minimum of three months except in fulfillment of present 
commitments involving foreign governments during that period 
3 during the time of rehabilitation brother swaggart will be 
relieved of his duties as copastor of family worship center 
retaining the right to preach in the family worship center after 
the period described in paragraph 2 
4 brother swaggart will receive counsel and supervision in 
weekly conferences with three members of the louisiana district 
presbytery during the period of rehabilitation 
5 brother swaggart will submit quarterly written reports to the 
district superintendent and monthly written reports to his 
sectional presbyter 
again no doubt much speculation and rumor will find its way 
into the secular media but for the church the body of christ 
such speculation and rumor has no place 
we urge brother swaggart and his associates to resist the 
request of those outside the church to respond to questions 
brother swaggart has been in complete cooperation with the 
assemblies of god and has pledged to work within the structure of 
the church

the us supreme courts rejection of a 
suit challenging what a tennessee fundamentalist group calls 
godless textbooks will enable schools to get on with teaching 
children an education official says 
weve been relieved of a lot of pressure pressure thats been 
on our shoulders since 1983 robert cooper hawkins county school 
superintendent said monday 
the lawsuit was filed that year by seven bornagain christian 
families who objected on religious grounds to the list of required 
reading textbooks for grades 18 the books included passages in 
the wizard of oz and cinderella works by science fiction 
writer isaac asimov hans christian andersen and anthropologist 
margaret mead 
after a trial us district judge thomas hull ruled in 1986 
that the families religious freedom had been violated awarded 
them 50000 in damages and allowed their children to avoid the 
reading classes 
but the 6th us circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling 
and threw out the families lawsuit 
on monday the high court dismissed the families appeal of that 
decision 
at this time we have no alternative other than to accept the 
supreme court ruling said vicki frost one of the plaintiffs 
her husband roger said the high courts action left 
fundamentalists across the country persecuted 
farley meade another plaintiff said there are a lot of poor 
christian parents who cant send their children to religious 
schools to me thats a sad day for religious freedom in america 
the president of the organization that financed the lawsuit 
called the supreme court action the most coercive ruling in the 
history of religious liberty litigation 
we are confident that this dreadful ruling will eventually be 
overturned said beverly lahaye president of concerned women of 
america in a statement issued in washington dc 
state attorney general wj michael cody praised the court 
action saying any alternative disposition would have been the 
cause of chaos in the school system 
cooper said the protracted case did not particularly disturb the 
countys 6800 public school students but as far as 
administrative personnel school board members and even some 
teachers it was very disruptive he said making copies of 
records and testifying in court took time that could have been 
better used in teaching 
the seven children involved in the lawsuit have long since 
transferred from to private schools he said adding that about 
4700 children in grades 18 were affected by the lawsuit 
robert sharp legal counsel for the state education department 
said the case never interfered with the states selection of 
approved textbooks or otherwise changed operation of the department 
the one issue that could have caused turmoil was whether 
there would be other parents who would seek to opt out of reading 
programs in other schools he said none did

a us military commander today charged 
north korea with destroying a civilian airliner to wreck the 1988 
olympic games and accused communist officials of being 
criminals 
rear admiral william t pendley of the united nations command 
traded accusations and taunts with north korean military 
representatives over the destruction of the plane the two sides 
also accused each other of fomenting tension and preparing for war 
i want you to tell those who are responsible for killing 115 
innocent civilians that their objective to discourage the 
community of nations from coming to the seoul olympics will not be 
met pendley said 
maj gen li tae ho the chief north korean delegate said the 
communist country had nothing to do with the attack he charged 
that south korean military authorities destroyed the plane as part 
of a scheme to retain power and to discredit the north you are 
stirring up confrontation and leading the situation on the 
peninsula to the brink of war li warned 
the united states south korea and other nations have charged 
that north korea was behind the nov 29 bombing of a korean air 
boeing 707 over the andaman sea with the loss of all 115 people on 
board north korea has denied it had anything to do with the 
attack the wreckage of the plane was never found 
the charges were made at the first meeting of the military 
armistice commission since the loss of the plane the panel polices 
the ceasefire that ended the korean war between north and south in 
1953 
the united nations command delegation presented a videotape of a 
televised confession made last month in seoul by kim hyon hui who 
said she was a north korean agent and that she destroyed the plane 
with a bomb as part of attempts to disrupt the olympic games that 
start in seoul in september 
ms kim rode on an early leg of the kal flight and she and a 
male companion took poison when they were detained in bahrain the 
man later died 
li and other north korean and chinese officials did not watch 
the tape and studiously stared at the ceiling or out of windows 
pendley said the confession was damning evidence that the north 
could not refute you thought you had committed the perfect 
crime but like all criminals you made a mistake he said 
north korea has been demanding to cohost the olympic games the 
international olympic committee and south korea have rejected the 
demand 
the north korean delegation replied with a rambling accusation 
charging that the south korean government bombed the plane to 
frighten people into voting for the government in the dec 16 
elections 
pendley rejected the north korean accusations and repeated a 
demand that those responsible for the attack be punished and north 
korea apologize for the incident you should honestly admit this 
terrible act he said 
north korea called the military armistice commission meeting to 
demand the united states and south korea abandon plans for annual 
team spirit military exercises involving 200000 men next month 
it was the first military armistice commission meeting since 
october 
the north korean delegates charged the exercises were 
preparations for an american nuclear attack and warned that the 
divided peninsula was being pushed toward war you have nuclear 
war plans worked out li charged 
pendley dismissed the north korean accusations and said the 
exercises were lawful military activities intended to guarantee the 
safety of south korea he said the united nations command had no 
intention of starting a war and posed no threat to north korea or 
peace in the region 
team spirit exercises will continue as long as the threat of 
aggression exists he said 
the united states maintains 40000 troops in south korea and 
heads the united nations command which represents the 16 nations 
that fought under un auspices against north korea and china during 
the korean war

a man who fought city hall to keep 
his seventiered tree house in his back yard can continue to use 
the structure as long as he makes some safety improvements city 
officials say 
i feel just fine with all of this mark tucker said after 
officials announced the outcome monday my kids feel fine that 
they can play in their tree house 
st louis park officials had objected to the tree house last 
may saying it was unsafe and exposed the city to possible lawsuits 
the dispute was taken to hennepin county district court where 
an agreement was reached during a hearing in minneapolis on feb 5 
judge daniel hart approved the compromise on feb 8 ruling that 
tucker can continue to use the structure for his children and a few 
friends as long as the safety improvements are made 
tucker 38 gained national publicity during his fight over the 
tree house and for a pair of 10day jail sentences he served in 
november 1987 and in january for housing code violations at 
minneapolis apartment buildings he owns 
the city said the agreement states that only the five tucker 
children who range from age 4 to 18 and up to four other people 
can use the tree house at any one time 
tucker may not use the tree house as a business office anymore 
or hold any more open houses such as one last year to solicit 
support in his fight with the city the agreement said 
the agreement requires tucker by june to provide the tree house 
ladder with safety cages and hand grips approved by a structural 
engineer the structure must be inspected for safety every year and 
after unusually severe weather such as winds in excess of 40 mph 
heavy snowstorms and ice storms the city said

gary kasparov leaned on the table staring at 
the chess board he scratched his head studied some more and 
accepted a draw 
elevenyearold josh waitzkin smiled and shook the world 
champions hand this memory would last 
well done wrote kasparov as he autographed the boys score 
sheet which josh will frame 
it was a heady day for all concerned monday as kasparov the 
24yearold soviet hero spent his first full day in the united 
states and 59 even younger chess buffs got a chance to face the 
champ in a simultaneous exhibition in a bronx elementary school 
gymnasium 
i was surprised at how long i stayed in 42 moves is a lot 
against the world champion said benjamin shuldiner a freckled 
10yearold who was checkmated two hours 
kasparov dapper in a grayandtan sweater tan slacks and green 
scarf arrived at the innercity school smiling and joking taking 
time to embrace curious students and pose for pictures 
asked how he expected to do against the children a routine 
exhibition for any grandmaster he laughed 
it is not a serious competition it is a joke he said in 
accented english its a special exhibition for children 
i will be happy if i am upset if i am upset they will be 
every happy this is the main goal of the simul to make people 
happy 
his opponents managed two draws 
when kasparov left he resembled an american sports hero 
working his way through a knot of admirers signing autographs 
posing for more pictures shaking hands and ducking into a 
limousine 
its a great day for chess said the champion this is the 
beginning of the promotion of chess in the usa 
kasparov said such exhibitions to spark childrens interest in 
the game are a very important tradition in chess 
i think it is the duty of the world champion he said if 
we get a lot of boys and girls into chess we can hope that in the 
nearest future we will find a new wave of talent 
hell spend five days in new york playing two more exhibitions 
and meeting mayor edward koch on thursday 
i have just seen the city from the window he said ill 
try to find some time to see something amazing 
he spent sunday evening at the manhattan chess club where he 
played 24 games of speed chess winning all but one which he drew 
he played blitz chess said club president doug bellizzi 
offhand not serious games with some very strong players i saw 
two brilliant combinations this is mozart this is beethoven 
or as 14yearold kk karanja said its like playing larry 
bird or michael jordan oneonone 
karanja however a former national elementary school champion 
managed one of the two draws allowed by kasparov on monday in most 
of the games kasparov moved instantly working his way around the 
large square of tables at times against waitzkin for instance 
he had to stop and think 
i was pretty confident the whole way i played a few 
inaccuracies said waitzkin a student at manhattans exclusive 
dalton school 
classes of students were led through the gym for a glimpse of 
kasparov 
kasparovs opponents ranged in age from 7 to 15 and came from 
such disadvantaged neighborhoods as the south bronx harlem east 
new york and brownsville as well as more affluent areas of 
manhattan

the ventura freeways dubious claim to fame 
as the worlds busiest piece of road is not only dubious its 
false say transportation officials and some smogchoked motorists 
are unhappy about it 
how did this happen i appreciated its reputation even as i 
was caught in its snarls said steve gediman 26 it was 
worthwhile just sitting there because i was sort of participating 
in a global event 
the stretch of freeway also known as route 101 through the 
san fernando valley may never have been the busiest despite a 
listing that says so in the guinness book of world records 
california department of transportation officials admitted monday 
thats because counting monitors on two other freeway stretches 
were out of commission for nearly five years and human guesses 
calculating traffic flow there were much too low said nick jones 
an associate transportation engineer 
aficionados of los angeles fabled congestion should not 
despair however the busiest portion of freeway in the world has 
been determined to be the santa monica freeway not far away jones 
said coming in second is the san diego freeway 
with the monitors fixed new calculations show an average of 
315000 cars traveled on one stretch of the santa monica freeway 
every day during 1987 while 300000 cars a day were logged on a 
portion of the san diego freeway compared with only 277000 on the 
ventura 
any time you get over 250000 cars per day whats the 
difference jones asked

the nations mainstream shiite moslem 
militia captured the three gunmen who kidnapped a us marine 
officer in southern lebanon last week security sources said today 
the sources said the three gunmen are among dozens of suspects 
the amal militia rounded up while searching for lt col william r 
higgins but that the man who masterminded the un observers 
abduction remained at large 
the gunmen who were not identified could not give their 
leaders whereabouts or say where higgins was being held said the 
sources who spoke on condition of not being further identified 
reporters in southern lebanon last week reported that the amal 
militia had detained more than 40 suspects but this was the first 
indication that the three gunmen were among those held 
the same sources said today that at least two israeli soldiers 
were killed and several wounded when their armored patrol was 
ambushed by arab guerrillas in the southern lebanese village of 
braachit at sundown monday 
it was not clear whether the ambush and kidnapping were related 
higgins 43 of danville ky was kidnapped south of the 
ancient port of tyre on wednesday the security sources said the 
three gunmen were captured in a dragnet in the two days following 
the abduction 
among the detainees are the three gunmen who seized col 
higgins and forced him into the first getaway car one source 
said 
another three suspects who were being held monitored higgins 
his movements before the abduction the same source said 
the source provided the information when asked for confirmation 
of an nbc news report that the three kidnappers had been captured 
the gunmen were being held by amal in tyre and had been 
interrogated but they were unable to provide useful information 
because their leader had kept them in the dark the source said 
the security source played down the significance of the gunmens 
detention saying the unidentified person who masterminded the 
kidnapping already had slipped out of south lebanon 
the operation was a masterpiece from a professional 
standpoint the source said the mastermind used five identical 
brown volvo cars plus two additional getaway cars a white peugeot 
and a red mercedes in the abduction the squad in each car did not 
know who was in the other car 
the organization of the oppressed on earth a proiranian shiite 
moslem group released a videotape monday in which higgins recited 
its demands for his release including an israeli pullout from a 
border zone in south lebanon 
the organization charged that higgins was a cia spy us and 
un officials denied the claim 
higgins heads a 76man un observer group drawn from 16 nations 
that monitors border violations of a 1949 armistice signed by 
lebanon and israel 
the group was attached to the 5800strong united nations 
interim force in lebanon in 1978 when the ninenation force was 
deployed to keep peace on the lebanonisrael border 
timur goksel the force spokesman said the search continued for 
higgins today in the tyre region 50 miles south of beirut 
goksel said 20 officers of higgins observer group have been 
withdrawn to un posts along the israeli border 
the kidnapping increased friction between shiite forces vying 
for dominance in southern lebanon 
it pitted the moderate amal which is backed by syria and is 
trying to rescue higgins against the extremist hezbollah or party

the soviet union has promised to be more flexible 
in granting emigration visas to its citizens secretary of state 
george p shultz said after conducting two days of talks with 
kremlin officials 
however foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said the matter 
of emigration was not open to negotiation 
soviet officials traditionally define emigration policy as an 
internal matter to improve relations with washington however 
they may have agreed privately to a more lenient look at 
applications 
shultz said at a news conference monday that his meetings with 
shevardnadze and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev produced 
helpful clarifications on human rights shultz described 
humanitarian concerns divided families jews refused permission 
to emigrate and free expression and practice of religion as the 
most important subject on his agenda 
shevardnadze in contrast said the meetings focused on the 
pivot of sovietus relations prospects for concluding a treaty 
by late spring that would reduce the strategic nuclear weapons of 
both nations by 50 percent 
he said human rights questions are being resolved by us more 
forcefully than before and characterized discussion of 
emigration and personal freedoms as a kremlin initiative the 
american delegation welcomed 
last year 8011 soviet jews were allowed to emigrate eight 
times the number granted exit visas the previous year 
jewish emigration activists in the west claim fewer visas have 
been issued since the december summit in washington between 
gorbachev and president reagan 
jewish emigration reached a peak of about 51000 in 1979 but 
dropped off as ussoviet relations worsened 
shultz told reporters we got some helpful clarifications 
particularly on emigration policy where we were assured there 
would be flexibility on applications requiring potential immigrants 
to have firstdegree relatives abroad emigration regulations 
that took effect in january 1987 allow soviets to seek 
reunification only with spouses siblings and parents 
refuseniks those denied permission to leave complain that the 
new laws make it more difficult for those seeking to join 
grandparents cousins and other relatives 
the secretary said there had been some misunderstanding about 
this and that has been straightened out at least for the balance 
of this year 
im glad that foreign minister shevardnadze confirmed quite 
categorically that the only barrier to emigration is past work 
involving state secrets 
soviets who have performed work considered of vital national 
importance or that makes the worker privy to classified 
information are routinely denied exit visas 
according to shultz his assistant secretary of state for 
humanitarian affairs richard schifter had encouraging meetings 
with soviet counterparts including representatives of the 
communist party central committee secretariat and the interior 
ministry which oversees the visaissuing office 
shevardnadze held a news conference later and was asked whether 
the promised flexibility meant the yearold regulations would 
be revised or the understanding was an informal one between the 
two governments 
he responded as far as the internal legislation of our 
country is concerned we are not discussing these matters with the 
secretary of state 
shevardnadze acknowledged reassessments were in progress on 
emigration and other policies western officials define as 
humanitarian concerns but declined further comment

alfred cumming a legislative aide to sen bob graham dfla said 
the hearings are scheduled to start in midmarch

about the allegations of haitian cocaine trafficking

participation of top military officials has become a major 
shipment and refueling point for drugs and guns since february 
1986 when former haitian president jeanclaude duvalier was 
replaced by a military junta

attorneys office in miami said that haiti was probably another 
example of a military that is up to its earlobes in drug 
operations the newspaper said

police chief col jeanclaude paul whose ranch and airstrip 90 
miles from portauprince has been used by cocaine smugglers said

an unemployed handyman visiting his old 
neighborhood was chased by a furious crackcrazed mob and fatally 
shot after he was accused of being an undercover narcotics agent 
police said 
daniel t foster 30 was shot as he fled from the jeering 
crowd according to a published report monday 
these people were so afraid that he was there to take their 
dope away that they killed him on the spot police inspector earl 
sanders told the san francisco examiner 
they killed him because he was a stranger it wasnt his 
neighborhood anymore sanders said 
foster once lived in the hunters point district but left the 
city in 1978 to move to virginia authorities said he returned to 
san francisco only a few weeks before his death 
just after midnight jan 22 foster got off a bus in his old 
neighborhood where he was going to visit his sister and found 
himself in the crowd of about 20 men and women some of them 
police said were high on crack cocaine a potent and dangerous 
form of the drug 
the same crowd had just fought police and forced officers to 
retreat under a barrage of rocks and bottles investigators said 
they were full of crack and at least one of them had a gun 
said sanders partner inspector napoleon hendrix foster stepped 
right into it 
when foster began walking toward his sisters apartment people 
in the crowd asked him if he was a cop said sanders 
he told them no and kept walking then they asked him if he 
was from sunnydale the turf of a rival gang but when he said 
no someone in the crowd said he was lying then they began to 
chase him he said 
foster ran down the block and had nearly reached the corner when 
someone in the crowd fired a pistol at least four times police 
said foster was hit once in the back and was pronounced dead at 
san francisco general hospital 
his killer has not been found authorities said 
the home he came back to was not the same one he left 
sanders said crack cocaine had claimed his friends as near as 
we can tell he never touched the stuff but in the end it got 
him too

the governments plan to have president 
kurt waldheim address a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of 
austrias annexation by nazi germany is becoming a major point of 
dispute 
german troops marched into the country nearly 50 years ago 
officially linking this alpine nation with adolf hitlers third 
reich austria did not become independent again until 1955 
austrians are marking the annexation called the anschluss in 
german as a time of reflection on a troubled period when throngs 
cheered hitler jews were harassed and resistance fighters executed 
austrian television and radio along with many of the countrys 
newspapers are giving much attention to the march 11 
commemoration the issue is especially sensitive because of the 
widely held opinion in austria that the country was a victim of 
the third reich 
now with waldheim under fire for his role as a first lieutenant 
in the german army in the balkans during world war ii it is 
increasingly uncertain what the bickering coalition government will 
do on the march 11 anniversary 
many austrian socialists have made it clear they are against the 
ceremony during which the 69yearold waldheim is scheduled to 
deliver a speech 
i have misgivings about this event fred sinowatz the 
socialist party chief and former chancellor told reporters at a 
news conference monday after a meeting of the partys leadership 
suggested that waldheim should step down 
the socialists senior partner in the government adopted a 
resolution saying a report on waldheims wartime record released 
earlier this month has badly shaken the presidents moral 
authority at home and abroad 
it has become obvious that waldheim cannot realize the 
most important aims he has set for himself that is to promote 
domestic peace in austria and to increase austrias prestige in the 
world the resolution said 
the leadership at the meeting which included chancellor franz 
vranitzky stopped short of asking for waldheims resignation 
the report on waldheims wartime record presented no evidence 
that would clearly back allegations that he committed wartime 
atrocities but it left open the question of whether he was guilty 
of any crime 
the report written by an international panel of historians 
said he was in close proximity to some nazi atrocities in the 
balkans knew they were going on and made no attempt ot prevent 
them 
it also said waldheim concealed his wartime past and tried to 
make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it 
waldheim has denied any wrongdoing 
instead of a commemoration ceremony sinowatz called for 
reflection of what happened on march 11 1938 and what must be 
done so that such a thing never happens again 
but deputy chancellor alois mock a leader of the conservative 
peoples party the junior member in the coalition government 
rejected the idea of scrapping the ceremony and the waldheim speech 
in viennas hofburg palace 
thats a suggestion that will never be accepted by the 
peoples party said mock waldheims most vigilant public 
defender at a separate news conference monday where he spoke on 
behalf of the party 
fritz koenig another peoples party leader urged a suspension 
of the political debate until after the nation commemorates the 
anniversary 
i think that after the ceremonies on march 11 there must be a 
discussion on how to achieve greater cooperation among the 
federal president the government and the parliament koenig said 
on behalf of the party 
newspapers are giving the dispute prominent play 
with increasing frequency there are suggestions that the 
government should simply call off the planned commemoration 
ceremonies for march 11 the conservative die presse said in its 
lead story monday 
a day earlier economics minister robert graf a peoples party 
member became the latest of several politicians to make such a 
suggestion 
he told a roundtable tv discussion that he had made the 
suggestion out of concern about further polarization 
on account of waldheim the 1938 commemorations are on shaky 
ground the socialist az tabloid of vienna said in a frontpage 
headling on monday 
the socialists and the peoples party made plans for the hofburg 
ceremony before the historians report on waldheims wartime past 
was issued 
waldheim was the conservative candidate in the presidential 
election he became president with 536 percent of the votes in a 
june 8 1986 runoff his term is scheduled to end in 1992 
in austria the president is head of state a largerly ceremonial 
position vranitzky runs the government

kim youngsam and rival opposition 
leader kim daejung met today to discuss merging their two parties 
in time for the parliamentary elections but they only agreed to 
discuss the issue again 
the surprise twohour private meeting was proposed by kim 
youngsam after he emerged today from two weeks of near seclusion 
and told reporters a merger would ensure an opposition victory in 
the balloting expected be held in april 
kim daejung president of the party for peace and democracy 
immediately agreed to the meeting which was held at a seoul hotel 
we will do our best to make the opposition merger successful 
at any cost kim youngsam said afterward kim daejung said he 
was not as optimistic no specific date was set for another meeting 
repeated efforts to reunite the two parties have failed and 
several rounds of talks in recent weeks have not produced any 
progress neither party indicated today that the situation had 
changed 
on feb 8 kim youngsam resigned as president of the 
reunification democratic party purportedly to help reunite the 
opposition before the national assembly elections 
the meeting was the two kims first since oct 29 when they 
split in disagreement over which of them should run as the 
opposition candidate in the dec 16 presidential elections each 
insisted on running giving government party candidate roh taewoo 
victory despite rohs failure to win a plurality 
after the defeat the two kims came under strong pressure to 
retire from politics many people accused them of putting personal 
ambition ahead of their avowed campaign goals of ending military 
rule 
when he quit as president of his party kim youngsam said he 
had expected the rival opposition groups could agree on a merger 
kim youngsam today said he believed that the merger of the 
opposition bloc is the only way to crush the ruling democratic 
justice partys plot to perpetuate its rule and revive democracy in 
this country so it must be achieved with the peoples power 
he said the new cabinet formed by roh who is to take office 
thursday is merely an extension of that of outgoing president chun 
doohwan the new cabinet includes several key holdovers from 
chuns administration 
kim youngsam said he had a great deal of doubt about rohs 
implementing democratic reforms roh a former general like chun 
has pledged to an end to the long tradition of authoritarianism in 
south korea 
the governing and opposition parties which have been squabbling 
over the number of lawmakers to be elected from each district have 
failed to rewrite the election law and to set an exact date for the 
national assembly election

a former police officer convicted of 
torturing a 17yearold boy with a 50000volt stun gun was 
sentenced to two years in prison by a judge who called his action 
a gross betrayal of public trust 
former huntington park police officer william lustig jr 32 
was convicted in december of one count of felony assault under 
color of authority because of the methods used during questioning 
of jaime ramirez another former officer robert rodriguez 27 was 
found guilty of aiding and abetting in the crime 
superior court judge michael berg on monday sentenced lustig to 
two years in state prison and rodriguez to six months in county 
jail as a condition of three years probation 
in our society a suspect in police custody has the right to 
be free from torture berg said these acts constituted a gross 
betrayal of the public trust 
its an embarrassment to everyone in the community this type 
of behavior said deputy district attorney james koller 
ramirez who attended the hearing with his parents said of the 
sentencing i think its fair its the law he has filed a 10 
million federal lawsuit claiming his civil rights were violated 
during the nov 30 1986 incident 
in december jurors convicted the two former officers of using a 
50000volt electric stun gun similar to a cattle prod to torture 
ramirez who had been arrested for questioning about stereo 
components he was carrying as he walked along a street in 
huntington park a los angeles suburb 
ramirez testified during the trial that lustig used the stun gun 
to burn his thighs through his clothing several times during 
interrogation 
lustigs attorney richard levine said his clients actions 
were not criminally motivated and he has endured enough 
punishment through the public humiliation he has had to withstand 
lustig had a misplaced belief that the ends justify the means 
in a criminal investigation levine saidthe attorney said he did 
not know whether he would file an appeal 
rodriguezs lawyer william hadden said he would appeal and 
the judge agreed to stay rodriguezs sentence pending the outcome 
setting bail at 3000

dedricks motion asked that the charges be dismissed without 
prejudice which allows him to seek another indictment 
rebecca was very happy over that as you might imagine her 
attorney w thomas dillard iii said of the dismissal of charges 
hopefully that will be the end of it 
dedricks motion did not specify why he wanted the charges 
dismissed and dillard said he would not care to speculate but it 
seemed likely that the ruling disallowing ms sharps statements 
was a direct cause 
those statements were suppressed meaning they could not be used 
as evidence against her on feb 12 by us magistrate robert p 
murrian 
murrian ruled the statements were made in a situation so 
inherently coercive that they must be considered as involuntary and 
compelled because the undercover agent posed as a representative 
of violent colombian drug dealers who wanted either their cocaine 
or their 12 million 
thorntons body was found on a knoxville driveway the morning of 
sept 11 1985 he carried bags with 77 pounds of cocaine in them 
and federal authorities have linked him to some 200 pounds of the 
drug found in duffel bags scattered across northern georgia 
a few days after thorntons death kieran kobell a special 
agent with the federal drug enforcement agency visited ms sharp 
in lexington 
kobell using an alias and a government informant now listed as 
a fugitive took ms sharp on a car ride during which kobell said 
she revealed an intimate knowledge of the cocainesmuggling 
operation and promised the deal would go through even if she had to 
kill somebody 
during testimony in the suppression hearing kobell said he did 
not force ms sharp to say anything during the car ride however 
murrian also noted that kobell threatened both ms sharp and her 
attorney in kentucky fred partin in a telephone call to the 
lawyer the next day according to partins testimony at the 
suppression hearing

sen jesse helms is asking the cia to 
investigate charges that the agency provided personal data to 
panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega about helms and sen 
edward m kennedy 
in a letter to cia director william webster helms said he had 
received reports that the cia had provided similar information on 
other senators to officials in other foreign countries 
the north carolina republican said maintenance of files on 
members of congress would be illegal and improper the transfer 
of such information to another government would call into 
question the integrity of us intelligence institutions helms 
wrote 
the letter a copy of which was made available to the associated 
press on monday was sent to webster following testimony by jose 
blandon a former noriega associate turned critic of panamas 
defense chief 
blandon testifying before a senate subcommittee on feb 9 said 
the cia passed to noriega data about helms kennedy dmass and 
two of their aides the senators have been among noriegas 
strongest critics on capitol hill citing allegations of noriegas 
involvement in drug trafficking 
at the time of blandons testimony the cia said it 
categorically denies his allegations 
a cia spokeswoman sharon foster had no comment monday on 
helms letter except to say that communications from members of 
congress are confidential but are taken seriously and responded to 
blandons testimony reinforced the notion that the cia had 
maintained close ties with noriega despite strong evidence dating 
back several years that he was involved in drug trafficking 
activities 
two federal grand juries have indicted noriega on drug related 
charges 
kennedy has said it was unconscionable that the cia knew about 
noriegas drug trafficking activities and continued to work with 
him for such a long time but it is even worse to think that the 
cia would provide information about noriegas leading american 
critics to the general himself 
blandon spent monday at us district court with prosecutors 
investigating the irancontra affair although no details were 
provided blandon presumably was questioned about his testimony 
that noriega agreed to provide training for nicaraguan contras 
after receiving a request from former white house aide lt col 
oliver l north in 1985 
helms in a separate letter to fbi director william sessions 
asked if the agency had ever passed on data about members of 
congress or their staffs to the cia and whether it had engaged in 
wiretaps or surveillance on him or members of his staff 
in his letter to the cias webster helms asked whether the cia 
had maintained information on members of congress or their staffs 
and whether such information was ever passed on to any official of 
a foreign government specifically the panamanian defense forces 
helms indicated he was skeptical about the cias denial 
contending that it made an inquiry afterward to cia field offices 
and to the heads of us agencies involved in national security 
issues as to whether the denial was accurate 
ms foster of the cia said she was unable to comment on that 
allegation 
helms asked webster not to rely on cia files because the 
information alleged to have been passed on may have gone through a 
back channel without files being maintained 
it is imperative that an internal investigation be conducted 
and all employees in contact with panamanian government or military 
officials be questioned helms wrote

secretary of state george p shultz 
left moscow today without a firm timetable for a soviet pullout 
from afghanistan but us intelligence sources said the red army 
is taking initial steps to leave 
soviet troops are retreating to defensive positions and 
dependents are being withdrawn a solid sign the soldiers will not 
be far behind a senior us official said 
in addition soldiers in the 115000man soviet force are not 
being replaced when they complete their tours of duty said the 
official who briefed reporters on shultzs flight to brussels on 
condition of anonymity 
shultz said monday at the end of two days of talks in moscow 
that he did not have the slightest doubt the red army would 
depart and after briefing nato officials in brussels today he 
reaffirmed his expectation the soviets would quit afghanistan 
but he evidently did not get a specific timetable from soviet 
communist party general secretary mikhail s gorbachev or soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
the garrisoning of soviet troops and departure of dependents is 
solid evidence the eightyear military intervention in 
afghanistan will soon end the us official said 
on feb 8 gorbachev offered to begin the pullout may 15 if 
pakistan and afghanistan reach a settlement by march 15 in 
negotiations due to resume in geneva next week he said the 
withdrawal could be achieved within 10 months 
the soviets have however accused pakistan of obstructing a 
settlement by insisting an interim coalition government be created 
in kabul to prevent the protracted civil strife islamabad says 
would otherwise ensue 
shultz has said such a government could facilitate the troop 
withdrawal and return of about 3 million refugees from pakistan 
but another senior us official said washington does not endorse 
pakistans position referring to the anticipated withdrawal the 
official told reporters we wouldnt want to miss the bus weve 
been trying to get the soviets out for years 
gorbachev has said moscow would not make the composition of the 
government it leaves behind a condition of withdrawal 
shultz stopped at nato headquarters in brussels today to brief 
the western allies who were especially interested in the steps 
taken on arms control 
from brusssels shultz was flying back to washington for a 
26hour respite before heading for the middle east try to push 
arabs and israelis into negotiations 
i dont think many people give me much chance shultz said 
with a smile but he added even if the chances are small its 
worthwhile trying 
also today shevardnadze left moscow for prague czechoslovakia 
to brief warsaw pact foreign ministers the soviet news agency tass 
said 
on monday us and soviet negotiators were directed to prepare 
within a month three draft agreements for a treaty to reduce 
longrange or strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 
percent such missiles have a range of more than 3400 miles 
the drafts will deal with verifying compliance with the 
cutbacks disposing the weapons and exchange of information they 
are to be ready for the next shultzshevardnadze meeting in 
washington on march 2223 
shultz told reporters in brussels that the two sides were still 
far apart on the us strategic defense initiative i think we 
moved it a little bit in moscow maybe imperceptibly he said of 
the disagreement over the us program to develop a spacebased 
defense against ballistic missiles 
on human rights shultz persuaded the soviets to drop for the 
rest of the year at least a requirement that jews who want to 
emigrate have a close relative living abroad 
a senior us official who demanded anonymity said about 90 
percent of jews who have applied for exit visas do not have close 
relatives in israel 
in the past several months the official said the soviets for 
the first time provided the united states with figures on 
applications waiting to be processed on feb 1 he said there 
were 1042 on file 
soviets who have performed work considered by the government to 
be of vital national importance or that involved classified 
information are routinely denied exit visas 
shultz told a news conference in moscow on monday that he gave a 
good mark to the twoday talks with shevardnadze that they had 
moved the two sides closer to a strategic arms agreement and a 
spring summit in moscow 
no specific date for a fourth summit between president reagan 
and gorbachev was agreed to but shevardnadze told reporters monday 
that both sides want the summit in late may or early june 
defense minister dmitri t yazov said monday the soviets will 
begin withdrawing shorterrange ss12 missiles from east germany 
and czechoslovakia late this month as a display of good will 
the missiles must be eliminated under the intermediaterange 
arms pact signed in december such missiles have a range of about 
300 to 3000 miles

a member of the senate armed services 
committee said today that the resignation of navy secretary james 
h webb will force congress to take a closer look at the pentagon 
budget and the future size of the navy 
i think what his resignation will do will cause us to look at 
our commitments sen william cohen rmaine said on cbs this 
morning can we in fact afford to keep the commitment that 
weve made without spending the money necessary to put out a fleet 
to do it 
the senator later added that webbs decision may spur very 
critical analysis of exactly where were going with the defense 
budget 
webb in announcing his resignation monday said he quit because 
defense secretary frank c carlucci made budget decisions that mean 
the target of a 600ship navy will never be met 
the resignation may be right for him but a bit premature 
for us cohen said after all secretary carlucci has to come 
before capitol hill present the budget 
we might disagree we might agree with secretary webb that 
perhaps the allocation of the cuts should not have come out of 
shipbuilding perhaps they should come out of some other service or 
some other way of achieving those cuts cohen said 
in 1981 president reagan promised to build the navy to a total 
of 600 deployable ships from the 450 the service had at that time 
the navy was given large increases for shipbuilding as part of 
the record military spending buildup in reagans first term 
although overall defense spending has slowed sharply during the 
last three years navy shipbuilding continued to grow although 
more slowly 
navy officials had said they would meet the target by next fall 
but carlucci ordered the service to mothball 16 aging frigates 
leaving it with 580 ships 
the defense secretary ordered the cuts as part of a package of 
33 billion worth of reductions carlucci had to find under an 
agreement reached by reagan and the democraticcontrolled congress 
to cut federal spending 
sen edward m kennedy dmass said monday that webbs 
decision has obviously launched an important new stage of the 
debate about pentagon priorities and the size and type of navy we 
need 
sen carl levin dmich said i never believed that there 
was anything magic about the number 600 
while carlucci ordered 16 older ships cut the navys budget 
includes money for 17 new ships among them are one missilefiring 
submarine two more 688class attack subs the first of a new class 
of seawolf attack subs and three destroyers 
carlucci declined to respond monday to webbs criticism but he 
noted last week that he had to make tough choices in cutting 
the budget

chinas economy grew by a robust 94 percent in 
1987 but rising prices caused by high consumer demand lowered 
living standards for one out of five city dwellers the state 
statistics bureau said today 
chinas gross national product for the year was 295 billion 
ranking it seventh in the world the report said industrial output 
was up 165 percent while agriculture output increased 47 percent 
the bureau in an annual report said chinas 200 million urban 
dwellers made an average of 248 last year up 106 percent before 
inflation its 800 million peasants averaged 125 each up 53 
percent 
but zhang zhongqi director of the bureaus comprehensive 
statistics department also said at a news conference that a 
nationwide survey showed 21 percent of urban households had less to 
spend last year because of an 88 percent rise in the cost of 
living index 
he said retail prices rose 73 percent nationwide compared to 
about 6 percent rise in 1986 in the cities however inflation hit 
91 percent 
he said the main factor was the inability of the nations 
producers particularly of food and consumer goods to meet the 
growing demands of a more affluent society 
meat poultry and egg prices climbed 165 percent and fresh 
vegetables and aquatic products rose about 17 percent pork and 
sugar were rationed for the first time in decades in many cities 
because farmers discouraged by rising prices for raw materials 
cut back production 
wage earners who received no salary raises and retirees on fixed 
incomes suffered the most from the price spiral he said 
zhang said the government was trying to overcome supplydemand 
imbalances by promoting production of nonstaple commodities 
controlling excessive investment that has led to an overheated 
economy and subsidizing some prices where consumers and producers 
are particularly hard hit 
he said 10 percent of chinas urban residents were economically 
distressed defined as having an annual income of less than 108 
in rural areas 82 percent or about 60 million people were 
under the poverty line of 54 a year zhang said poor people in the 
countryside fell from 80 million in 1986 but he gave no 
comparative figures for the urban poor 
zhang said unemployment hovered around 3 percent in 1987 he 
said underemployment millions of workers in factories and offices 
with little or nothing to do was an even more serious problem 
the chinese government has acknowledged that inflation 
unemployment and income disparities are all problems that china 
will have to live with as it adjusts from a rigid central planning 
system to a statecontrolled but increasingly decentralized market 
economy 
among the strong points were the nations foreign trade with 
exports rising 278 percent to 395 billion the trade deficit 
fell from 12 billion in 1986 to 37 billion last year 
it said new foreign investment in 1987 totalled 757 billion 
up 43 percent of which 533 billion was from borrowing and 24 
billion from direct investment

invalid 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower said he had ordered 
the 30day quarantine on fruits and plants to protect texas 65 
millionayear citrus industry from the canker which had infected 
some florida citrus groves 
the us department of agriculture hightower charged had bowed 
to pressure from florida growers earlier this month when it lifted 
a ban on shipments of florida citrus to other citrusproducing 
states the ban was imposed in 1984 following an outbreak of citrus 
canker in florida 
the suit by nonprofit florida citrus mutual and tuxedo fruit 
co a citrus grower and shipper alleged that texas quarantine 
would cost the florida citrus industry millions of dollars 
the florida petition which seeks a preliminary injunction said 
an amended quarantine in florida permits interstate movement of 
fruit from florida under certain rigorous federal standards 
max woodfin spokesman for the texas department of agriculture 
said texas agriculture officials were prepared to defend the 
quarantine in any peaceful forum available 
woodfin noted that a public hearing has been scheduled for 
thursday in mcallen testimony is expected from florida 
california arizona louisiana and us department of agriculture 
officials as well as texas producers and experts on citrus disease

bestowed on an american 
the brief private ceremony at buckingham palace didnt mean the

accolade is reserved for the queens own subjects but it was 
britains way of saying thanks to an exceptionally good friend 
asked why he got the knighthood weinberger modestly replied 
i havent the faintest idea 
but the announcement feb 1 cited his outstanding and 
invaluable contribution to angloamerican defense cooperation 
and his unfailing support and assistance during the 1982 
falkland islands war between britain and argentina 
the 70yearold weinberger who counts winston churchill among 
his heroes did not have to kneel before the queen as a commoner 
and be tapped on both shoulders with a sword as is the custom for 
british subjects 
her majesty was nice enough just to present it to me he 
said adding im very honored very pleased and still very 
astonished 
he received a red ribbon with the badge of the order of the 
british empire and a separate silver star signifying the title 
knight grand cross the highest order of chivalry for a foreigner 
it means he can now call himself caspar weinberger gbe 
weinberger wearing a gray suit was accompanied by his wife 
jane and foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe who had recommended 
him for the honor 
the 25minute ceremony was held without reporters or 
photographers present in the small bluewalled queens audience 
room where the 61yearold monarch often receives official visitors 
she was very gracious as always and very generous in her 
remarks weinberger told reporters afterward he politely avoided 
mentioning what they discussed 
he carried his new insignia in a blue presentation box which he 
opened for photographers just before driving away to a luncheon 
hosted by us ambassador charles h price ii 
when weinbergers award was announced reporters asked him 
whether he was ready to be called sir cap he replied good 
god no our constitution has some harsh words about titles but i 
really am flattered 
asked after the ceremony whether he was now more of an 
anglophile he replied well its hard to be not 
weinberger retired nov 5 after nearly seven years as president 
reagans defense chief 
the united states provided critical intelligence and logistical 
support to britain during its 74day campaign to oust argentinas

weinberger insisted monday that his role was a comparatively 
modest small one 
buckingham palace said only a very few of the 55 other americans 
who have received honorary knighthoods were made gbes the most 
famous americans who have received honorary knighthoods were made 
knights of the british empire or kbes a lower order of chivalry 
they include former secretary of state dean rusk industrialist 
henry ford iii philanthropists paul mellon and john paul getty ii 
actors douglas fairbanks jr and sidney poitier former sen j

kbe but his award was changed to a full knighthood after he gained 
dual britishus citizenship in 1985 and he is now known as sir 
yehudi 
weinberger has longstanding links with britain and has visited 
often finding strong support from prime minister margaret thatcher 
for reagans military buildup at home and his drive to modernize 
nato and keep it unified 
the angloamerican relationship he said is critically 
important to the western alliance 
weinberger gave up an invitation to the white house last 
november to make his debut as a british television commentator on 
the treaty eliminating medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles 
which he helped secure and had some candid assessments of the 
soviet leadership 
last month he was appointed a distinguished visiting professor

participating in a special project investigating the interplay 
among technology communications and the humanities 
weinberger often cites churchill especially the late prime 
ministers early warnings in the 1930s that europe must rearm in 
response to the growing military threat from germany 
weinberger says he sees some rather deadly parallels today 
and warned monday that nato must remain strong to deal with 
increasing soviet threats

the cuban government plans to 
release a significant number of political prisoners in an effort to 
block a formal united nations investigation of human rights in 
cuba us officials say 
fidel castro will release thousands of political prisoners 
mixed in with common prisoners to persuade member nations to vote 
down the american proposal for the un investigation said armando 
valladares chief of the us delegation to the un human rights 
commission in geneva 
a spokesman for a cuban delegation in geneva was quoted today by 
the fort lauderdale newssun sentinel as saying a major 
announcement would be made in cuba on wednesday but he would not 
elaborate 
a state department official who closely follows cuban affairs 
said the thousands suggested by valladares who spent 22 years 
in cuban prisons may be overly optimistic but a good chance 
exists the cubans will free enough prisoners to make the action 
appear significant 
even if it is for cosmetic purposes we love it said the 
official who asked not to be identified were talking about 
human lives here even if a release is done cynically people are 
still out of prison 
the united states placed a similar resolution before the un 
human rights commissions annual session last year it failed by 
one vote on a procedural motion 19 to 18 with five nations 
abstaining the state department again expects a close vote 
although the resolution does not condemn cubas human rights 
record a un investigation of human rights practices on the 
communist island would be politically embarrassing to castro 
estimates of cuban political prisoners range from as few as 500 
to as many as 10000 the state department official said castro 
himself has acknowledged holding 1000 to 2000 such prisoners

republican presidential hopeful pat 
robertson said today that charges of jimmy swaggarts sexual 
misconduct had been known for a few months but somebody planned 
the scandal to embarrass him before the super tuesday elections 
swaggart a television evangelist accused of sexual misconduct 
was ordered monday by the hierarchy of his church in baton rouge 
la to limit his preaching and enter counseling 
robertson who bristles at the label of former television 
evangelist said today that evidence showing that swaggart had been 
involved with prostitutes had lied dormant since last october 
it stretches the imagination and stretches credulity that it 
came two weeks before the most important primary in the nation 
the republican candidate said during a news conference in columbia 
a round of primaries and caucuses will be held super tuesday march 
8 in 20 states 
nothing happens to people by accident robertson said in an 
interview monday with the anderson sc independentmail it is 
kind of funny this came up two weeks before the most important 
primaries in the nation people probably wonder what went on 
i think somebody had something to do with it said 
robertson somebody else planned all these things i am afraid 
asked again today whether he had any evidence to show that the 
scandal broke just before super tuesday robertson replied i 
have no knowledge its certainly a coincidence 
on monday robertson offered no proof of his contention and 
declined to say to whom he was referring however in the same 
interview he accused the campaign of vice president george bush of 
dirty politics and trickery directed at him 
a bush campaign official asked about the remarks said 
robertson had apparently adopted a new campaign strategy of 
making bizarre statements in order to make news 
to suggest that we had something to do with the swaggart 
affair borders on the outlandish said jay morgan bushs deputy 
southern political director in a telephone interview from his home 
in atlanta 
robertson repeated his charge today that the bush campaign plans 
dirty tricks in south carolina saying he was told that the 
vice presidents campaign plans to run some television ads 
dealing with religious bigotry in the few days before the south 
carolina primary elections 
bush campaign ad director sid rogich said today the only ad 
running in south carolina is a biographical commercial 
two weeks ago robertson scolded nbc anchor tom brokaw who 
interviewed him live on the night of the iowa caucuses for 
referring to him as a former television evangelist 
robertson who founded the christian broadcasting network and 
for years hosted its flagship program the 700 club says he 
wants to be described as a former religious broadcaster or a 
television businessman 
earlier monday robertson had said swaggarts troubles were 
unfortunate but had nothing to do with him 
he said the swaggart case will have no more effect on me than 
gary hart had on other candidates referring to harts problems 
following reports of his relationship with a miami model hart 
dropped out of the presidential race in may but rejoined it in 
december 
it the swaggart controversy will not affect me because it 
has nothing whatsoever to do with me robertson told the anderson 
newspaper but i want to tell people to ask george bush what he 
thinks about all this 
i have been told of bushs dirty tricks and i expect to see 
them in south carolina he said his campaign will use every 
kind of dirty trick against me because this state is important and 
i have a lot of support and george bush knows that 
south carolina holds its primary march 5 three days before 20 
states mainly in the south hold primaries and caucuses

the fbi today denied it had conducted a 
political investigation of antireagan activists saying it had 
information that members of the targeted group planned or discussed 
disrupting the 1984 republican convention and shutting down a 
public utility 
the fbis executive assistant director oliver b revell came 
before a senate panel to defend the probe of the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador the probe was ended 
without any charges being filed 
the group has said it was investigated because it opposes 
president reagans central america policies 
documents previously released in the march 1985june 1985 probe 
show that fbi agents and informants sent to spy on cispes collected 
so much information on peaceful protest activities that bureau 
headquarters was worried that the investigation had gone too far 
the documents released under the freedom of information act 
have shown that while the investigation was targeted at cispes the 
files eventually included information on hundreds of other 
individuals and groups ranging from roman catholic nuns to union 
leaders who opposed reagan policies 
in defending the probe revell told the senate intelligence 
committee that in addition to possible violence cispes was 
involved in circulating forged us documents and had strong ties 
to the us communist party 
some have insinuated that this investigation was politically 
motivated as many individuals associated with cispes were opposed 
to reagan administration policies in central america revell 
said nothing could be further from the truth 
we did find indications that some cispes members were at least 
discussing and planning violence our investigtions uncovered one 
cispes member who was tasked to determine response times of 
emergency services in a major american city another cispes member 
stated he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in a 
major midwestern city as well as plans to violently disrupt the 
1984 republican convention 
the bureau initiated the investigation under foreign 
intelligence and counterintelligence guidelines designed to 
protect the united states against crimes such as espionage and 
terrorism in which foreign powers or groups are involved 
these guidelines allow the fbi to focus more on politically 
oriented groups and their missions than on specific crimes that are 
planned or carried out because of this wider latitude some 
lawmakers and the american civil liberties union warn that it is 
easy to cross the line and investigate free speech and peaceful 
assembly 
fbi director william s sessions said the investigation in this 
case was predicated on information received from several sources 
that certain leaders and key members of cispes were involved in 
covertly furnishing funds and materials to a foreign terrorist 
organization the group was identified as the fmln the group 
fighting a war against the usbacked government of el salvador 
jerry berman chief legislative counsel for the american civil 
liberties union said the investigation should have started under 
the most strict guidelines those for general criminal 
investigations 
these investigations can only begin when facts or 
circumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been is 
being or will be committed if the crime has already been 
committed the probe focuses on who committed the act and on 
securing evidence 
the fbi is given greater leeway for a domestic intelligence 
investigation which can focus on groups in the united states 
trying to further political or social goals through activities 
that involve criminal violence 
the bureau did not place the cispes investigation under either 
the intelligence or general guidelines but under the foreign 
intelligence and counterintelligence rules that involve 
participation by foreign entities 
these rules remain largely classified but officials familiar 
with them say they provide the widest latitude among the different 
sets of guidelines 
on july 26 1984 some 16 months after the investigation began 
fbi headquarters sent 32 field offices a message that suggested 
some of them were going beyond the guidelines 
some offices have reported information recently regarding 
political statements and political lobbying by cispes or cispes 
affiliates it said supervisors in recipient offices must 
carefully monitor this and related investigations and asset 
operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate 
direction targeting and reporting 
but messages from the field showed that bureaus were still 
confused 
in august 1984 the denver office told headquarters the field 
is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political 
activity can be monitored 
and prior to the july directive fbi headquarters received 
messages like this one from cincinnati the bureau is requested 
to furnish cincinnati with guidelines regarding investigation of 
captioned matter visavis religious organizations specifically 
the roman catholic church 
rep don edwards dcalif chairman of the house judiciary 
civil rights subcommittee said he does not fault the fbi for 
starting the investigation under foreign intelligence guidelines 
but for a management problem in not shutting it down much 
sooner 
we want it narrow and stopped when criminal conduct is not 
found he said in an interview the cispes investigation went 
on for years and there was no criminal conduct somebody should 
have blown the whistle 
berman of the aclu said the field offices became a vacuum 
cleaner for collection of first amendment activity 
they never began to narrow it he said they ended up 
sweeping up the first amendment activity and broadly targeting 
cispes all over the country

the afghan guerrilla alliance today 
announced a plan to form a coalition cabinet that would replace the 
communist government of president najib and ensure the withdrawal 
of soviet troops from afghanistan 
western diplomats in kabul meanwhile reported a bomb went off 
in the soviet embassy compound indicating the guerrillas are 
intensifying their attacks in the capital 
the sevenparty islamic unity of afghan mujahedeen announced the 
plan in a statement telexed from the pakistani border city of 
peshawar it stipulates that afghanistan would have a 28member 
cabinet to replace najibs peoples democratic party of afghanistan 
the statement said the government would be made up of 14 
ministers from among the guerrilla leadership seven 
representatives from among the 3 million afghan refugees in 
pakistan and seven moslems presently living in kabul 
earlier guerrilla leaders said these moslems would include 
noncommunists in the kabul administration who have not committed 
serious offenses against the people during the eightyear war 
the proposal which would allow the guerrillas to control the 
afghan government was not expected to be accepted by the soviets 
or the current administration in kabul 
diplomatic sources said today that moslem guerrillas have 
stepped up attacks in kabul where communist officials and soviet 
advisers reportedly are preparing to leave 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said at 
least 18 explosions were heard during the past week in the afghan 
capital including one in the soviet embassy compound and one near 
radio afghanistan 
one source said a bomb inside the soviet compound feb 19 caused 
some injuries but there were no further details 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev announced early this month 
that the red army could begin pulling its 115000 troops out of 
afghanistan by may 15 if kabul and islamabad sign a unsponsored 
accord by midmarch 
a new round of indirect talks between islamabad and kabul is 
scheduled for march 2 at geneva pakistan insists an accord should 
be linked to an agreed plan on formation of a transitional 
government 
islamabad and the guerrillas are pushing this point because they 
fear an outbreak of fighting between various afghan groups and the 
communists if no government is in power 
the soviets however disagree charging that such an insistance 
on setting up an interim government is obstructing soviet plans to 
withdraw 
guerrilla leaders have rejected any powersharing with the 
current kabul officials and todays statement from peshawar backed 
up that position 
the statement said a shooraali or supreme council would also be 
formed to oversee the cabinet it would consist of the leaders of 
the sevenparty alliance and would provide joint leadership 
during the interim period 
the insurgents said the broadbased transitional government 
will represent all sections of the afghan nation 
the alliance said there would be a consultative council of 75 
members consisting of two members from each of afghanistans 28 
provinces and 19 members from among moslem religious scholars 
intellectuals and technocrats the council would frame the interim 
laws to administer the country until an elected constituent 
assembly writes a constitution 
the country would adopt the name the islamic state of 
afghanistan wherein the koran will be supreme the 
statement added

a police crackdown on street gangs has been 
applauded by some black leaders tired of the violence that claimed 
300 lives last year but the arrest of an offduty black officer 
also raises the question of harassment 
black and hispanic leaders accused police of largely ignoring 
the gang violence until a woman bystander was killed jan 30 in 
streetgang crossfire in an upscale neighborhood 
but two weeks after the shooting an offduty black policeman 
from a bluecollar suburb was arrested by los angeles police as he 
stood on a street corner in the same neighborhood accompanied by 
six black youths the officer said his group was conducting an 
informal sting operation to investigate alleged harassment by 
city police 
both the arrest and the killing of 27yearold karen toshima 
occurred in westwood village a theater and restaurant district 
that soaring housing prices have turned into a relatively wealthy 
neighborhood 
authorities say there were more than 300 gangrelated murders in 
los angeles county in 1987 and the rate is increasing but gang 
violence usually is confined to the predominantly black and 
hispanic southside neighborhoods of the nations secondlargest 
city where turf battles between drug dealers have led to driveby 
shootings 
five people were killed and five others were injured in gang 
shootings last weekend even as police staged a crackdown deputy 
chief glenn levant newly appointed as the citys antigang czar 
said the more than 50 arrests were part of a strategy to prevent 
murders by taking gang members out of circulation 
children playing in parks and a 67yearold woman sitting in a 
wheelchair have been killed when gang hitmen missed their targets 
and thats not the way it should be we should be able to live 
normally said barbara thomas spokeswoman for the south central 
organizing committee which says it represents thousands of black 
families 
city councilman nate holden who is black and represents a 
largely black district said the yearning for more police 
protection crosses racial lines 
ive had white people complain about the gangs they all just 
want to feel secure in their community and their homes he said 
at the same time the sting by sgt don jackson of the hawthorne 
police department called into question the racial sensitivity of 
the los angeles police 
none of those kids did anything except stand on that corner 
and be black and that was enough said jackson who was 
released on his recognizance after being arrested on a misdemeanor 
charge of resisting an officer 
the police department defended the arrest of jackson and 
frisking of the others saying the group dressed like gang 
members was blocking the sidewalk and refused to move 
the question of police harassment is among the issues being 
considered as the city moves ahead with a plan to hire 150 more 
officers increasing the force to its largest strength ever 7500 
officers 
police chief darryl gates on monday declined to say anything 
about how he will deploy his forces until after a march 8 hearing 
of the citys advisory police commission 
mayor tom bradley as he approved the new hiring last week said 
the additional forces would help return this city to a drugfree 
gangfree atmosphere 
john p kenney a criminologist and former police commission 
member said more police officers is not the answer it wouldnt 
solve the problem it would for a few days or for a few weeks then 
you get complaints of overpolicing and harassing he said 
historically theres a resentment to an excessive show of 
force said garrett capune professor of criminology at the 
university of southern california it has a racist overtone you 
know there seems to be more crime because theres more officers 
it becomes a sort of selffulfilling prophecy 
but holden replied these guys can sit in some classroom and 
think what its supposed to be like but they havent seen the real 
world i resent them let them come into the black community and 
see what its like 
hundreds of southside residents demonstrated at police 
headquarters after extra officers were deployed in westwood this 
month primarily at the request of merchants who were afraid their 
business would be hurt by news of the gang shooting 
minority activists later publicized a study by the independent 
public administration service in virginia that appeared to show 
police responded more slowly to crimes in poor areas 
the police department on friday released a letter from the 
principal author of the report stating that it had been widely 
misinterpreted the letter said the study concluded the department 
takes too long to respond to emergencies but that geographical 
differences are not significant

a british soldier ordered 
jailed for life for killing a belfast roman catholic has been freed 
and returned to his regiment after serving only three years in 
prison the army said today 
the disclosure came amid angloirish tensions following the 
killing of a catholic man on sunday by a british soldier and the 
irish governments decision to conduct its own investigation of the 
slaying which occurred in northern ireland 
the announcement that the convicted killer pvt ian richard 
thain was back in uniform although not in northern ireland 
provoked sharp reactions from leaders of the provinces catholic 
minority at the same time leaders of northern irelands 
protestant majority were angered by dublins announcement that it 
will probe sundays killing 
thain was jailed for the fatal shooting of thomas reilly road 
manager of the pop group bananarama on aug 9 1983 thain claimed 
in court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed 
reilly was about to pull a gun on him 
but the judge found him deliberately untruthful and said he 
did not believe thain truly feared reilly was about to shoot at 
him thain was the first soldier sentenced to life imprisonment for 
actions in northern ireland 
an army statement said thain was then 18 and while the army in 
no way condones his action we consider the incident to have been a 
tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very difficult 
circumstances 
the home office said thain was released on a life license a 
form of parole whereby he can be reimprisoned should his behavior 
give rise to concern it said he was freed after a review by the 
state parole board 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed irish 
republican army said thains release showed there was no justice 
in northern ireland the victims father jim reilly said im 
very very shocked and distressed i cant believe this has 
happened 
meanwhile the irish government sent deputy police commissioner 
eugene crowley to monaghan on the border with northern ireland to 
launch an investigation into sundays shooting of 23yearold aidan 
mcanespie 
mcanespie was killed by a bullet from an army observation tower 
at a checkpoint near aughnacloy half a mile from the frontier in 
county tyrone 
relatives said he was walking to a weekly gaelic football game 
and had passed through the checkpoint when he was shot 
mcanespie was a sinn fein supporter and his former parish 
priest said he was harassed whenever he passed through the 
checkpoint press association the british news agency said the 
soldier who fired at mcanespie told his interrogators it was an 
accident the soldier is in military custody 
the irish move was seen as a calculated slight to britain since 
its police force in the province was conducting an inquiry british 
authorities stressed that the irish investigation would be confined 
to irelands side of the border

a judge has ordered a quick trial of a lawsuit 
that could affect whether an 11yearold boy with leukemia lives or 
dies 
the suit was filed by the boys father jim lacina of geneva to 
regain health insurance coverage he contends was mistakenly 
canceled 
doctors say the boy jamie needs a bone marrow transplant by 
march 15 to survive more than a few months but the fred hutchinson 
cancer research center the seattle hospital that could treat the 
boy requires patients to have insurance coverage or 100000 in 
hand before it will perform the procedure said hospital 
spokeswoman susan edmonds 
cuyahoga county common pleas judge carl j character declined 
monday to decide the case without a jury but set a jury trial date 
for monday so a verdict could be issued in time for jamie to get 
the treatment 
weve definitely advanced this case more than a year 
character said they the lacinas came in and indicated the 
condition of the young man had become more critical hopefully 
it can be resolved in a timely fashion 
lacina says chemotherapy no longer is an effective treatment for 
his son 
in the lawsuit filed in 1986 lacina said nationwide life 
insurance co of columbus terminated his health insurance without 
notifying him 
a nineyear agent for nationwide lacina lost his job in 1983 
because of company cutbacks attorneys for both sides agree that he 
paid to continue his policy after he lost his job 
lacinas attorney gerald jeppe told character that lacina 
didnt receive a copy of his policy a notice that his premium was 
due or a termination notice in late 1983 he asked the judge to 
rule in lacinas favor without a jury trial 
jeppe said lacina is applying for medicaid while he awaits a 
decision on the case meanwhile a fund for the boy has been 
established at a bank he said 
nationwides attorney edward e duncan told character that the 
company mailed lacina the documents in question a jury should 
decide whether lacina received them he said 
the facts of this case are indeed tragic a little boy through 
no fault of his own may be denied care duncan said the long 
and the short of it is whether mr lacina is telling the truth when 
he says he didnt receive either of those letters or that policy 
duncan said nationwide will prove at the trial that lacinas 
behavior was inconsistent for a man who thought he had health 
insurance coverage lacina ran up large hospital bills for his son 
and filed for bankruptcy duncan said 
the lawsuit wasnt filed until the summer of 1986 duncan 
said what was mr lacina doing between 1983 and 1986 with these 
hospital bills if he had coverage 
jeppe declined to discuss the case aside from the comments he 
made in court

boston mayor raymond flynn has written to city 
councilors seeking approval of an experimental sterile needle 
exchange for drug addicts in hopes of curbing the spread of aids 
flynn said addicts their sex partners and their babies are 
the fastest growing group of aids victims and that conventional 
antidrug measures do not go far enough in the short term to 
curb the spread of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
dr george a lamb the citys director of clinical and 
community health services was prepared to outline the proposed 
program at a closed meeting this morning at city hall according to 
the boston globe he recently toured several european cities to 
examine needle distribution programs 
addicts could enter the program on their own or by referral 
lamb said 
flynn is seeking approval by the city council of a home rule 
petition to the legislature the newspaper said the move would 
bypass any applicable state laws against possession of hypodermic 
syringes by drug addicts or against dispensing such equipment to 
drug addicts 
gov michael s dukakis has opposed any needle exchange program 
as had state public health commissioner deborah prothrowstith 
the globe quoted prothrowstith as suggesting monday night that 
if the state wanted to consider something really radical it 
could supply addicts not only with sterile needles but also with 
heroin 
but department of public health spokesman john stobierski said 
today the comment was in no way a policy recommendation or 
proposal but was made by the commissioner in explaining why she 
believed the needle exchange proposal was very very wrong 
in a statement today prothrowstith said the department remains 
opposed to a needle exchange for iv drug users and that the state 
should continue to concentrate on drug treatment and rehabilitation 
programs 
a proposal by new york city to supply a small number of addicts 
with clean needles on an experimental basis awaits formal approval 
from the state health commissioner dr david axelrod who had 
opposed the idea but said last month that he would approve it 
new york wants to supply 200 to 400 addicts with syringes the 
recipients would have to turn in used needles to get fresh ones 
the needles would be tested for aids and to ensure that they 
werent shared 
although the test period would last a year the citys health

the united states will be able to provide 
military help to nato allies despite the new ussoviet treaty 
banning mediumrange nuclear weapons from europe the chief us 
negotiator for the pact told a senate committee today 
if it is not prohibited by the treaty we can do it maynard 
glitman told the senate armed services committee 
glitman was testifying about the effect of article 14 a 
provision which says that neither side shall do anything now or in 
the future to undercut the pact 
sen dan quayle rind told glitman that im concerned about 
article 14 because it might limit future us aid to nato nations 
the provision is a standard clause added to other treaties which 
simply restates the intention of both nations to abide by the pact 
glitman said 
the treaty spells out in great detail what each side cannot do 
and anything is permitted if it is not prohibited said glitman 
for example said glitman the treaty doesnt ban the transfer 
of us technology to nato nations such as great britain to develop 
groundlaunched cruise missiles those us missiles will be banned 
by the treaty but the british could go ahead and build their own 
he said 
glitman said us negotiators resisted soviet efforts to block 
us help for nato we knew their goal was to find a way to put a 
brake on nato activities he said 
president reagan pledged today that the united states will do 
its part to ensure that the nato alliance remains strong saying in 
an address broadcast to europe that our destiny is coupled with 
yours 
in the address which came a week before a nato summit meeting 
reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any 
member nation is an attack against all of them simply put an 
attack on munich is the same as an attack on chicago he said 
glitmans testimony was part of a detailed examination of the 
pact a linebyline scrutiny which legislators said was necessary 
to avoid possible conflicts with future administrations over the 
treatys meaning 
it is very regrettable that we have to go through this 
armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga said monday to 
glitman 
nunn and other democrats noted that the scrutiny arises from 
congressional distrust of the executive branch a skepticism born 
of the fight over the meaning of an earlier treaty 
nunn noted the state department had delivered 31 volumes of 
records about how ussoviet negotiators reached the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces pact signed by president reagan 
and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
committee staffers spent 300 hours reviewing only three volumes 
of records that preceded the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
nunn said 
the armed services panel is one of three senate committees 
examining the inf treaty ratification by the full senate is 
expected but the votes will be delayed until after nunns committee 
finishes it close examination nunn told his colleagues monday 
ratification would require a twothirds vote 
the distrust arose from a dispute between the 
democraticcontrolled congress and the reagan administration over 
the meaning of the abm pact particularly how it would affect 
reagans star wars missiledefense research program 
the existing narrow interpretation of the abm pact would ban 
some tests of the strategic defense initiative as star wars is 
formally known but reagan has asserted that his administration has 
the right to unilaterally move to a broad view of the pact that 
would permit sdi tests 
nunn led a congressional fight to block the move to a broad 
view of the abm pact and promised to delay the inf ratification 
until the administration promised that current testimony on the inf 
pact was authoritative 
administration officials had argued that the 1973 executive 
branch testimony on the abm pact wasnt authoritative 
nunn told glitman that committee staff members had drawn up 135 
questions many of them technical about possible ambiguities in 
the treaty 
two other democrats on the committee supported nunns decision 
to scrutinize the inf pact 
sen john glenn dohio said im sorry there was a 
reinterpretation of the abm treaty that made this necessary sen 
james exon dneb said its sad we have to go through the 
exercise were going through here 
meantime dr edward teller the physicist who is considered the 
father of both sdi and the hydrogen bomb supported the treaty in 
testimony before the foreign relations committee 
teller noted that he deeply distrusts the soviets and said my 
personal approach to the treaty is careful doubtful yet 
positive 
teller termed the fights over the meaning of the treaty 
senseless debates

a criminal suspects rights are not violated 
when a witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court 
testifies about an earlier identification of the accused the 
supreme court ruled today 
the justices voting 62 ordered the reinstatement of the 
conviction of a california prison inmate in the beating of a prison 
guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack 
justice antonin scalia in his opinion for the court said a 
defendants right to crossexamine his accusers is not violated by 
admission of a prior outofcourt identification statement from a 
witness who is unable to explain in court the basis for the 
identification 
scalia said defense lawyers have ample power to attack the 
credibility of such witnesses when they take the stand 
the weapons available to impugn the witnesss statement when 
memory loss is asserted will of course not always achieve 
success scalia said but successful crossexamination is not 
the constitutional guarantee 
the decision is a victory for the reagan administration which 
urged the court to reinstate the federal conviction of james joseph 
owens for assault with intent to murder john foster a guard at a 
federal prison in lompoc calif 
owens a prisoner there at the time of the attack was sentenced 
to an additional 20 years for the assault 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals overturned owens assault 
conviction on grounds he was denied the right to crossexamine 
foster effectively 
foster was attacked on april 12 1982 with a metal pipe he 
suffered numerous injuries to his head face arms and hands 
on may 5 1982 shortly before he was released from a hospital 
foster told an fbi agent that owens had attacked him foster also 
picked owens photograph from several mug shots 
but at the trial foster said he was unable to recall who 
assaulted him or whether he actually saw his assailant he did 
testify that he remembered identifying owens when questioned in the 
hospital by the fbi agent but said he no longer remembered why he 
said owens was the assailant 
the 9th circuit court said foster may have been influenced by 
visitors who spoke with him during his hospital stay 
three inmates testified that owens was the attacker there also 
was evidence that owens attended a meeting the day before the 
assault of the moorish science temple of america a prison 
religious group that discussed attacking foster 
in a dissenting opinion today justice william j brennan said 
the high court ruling reduces the right of confrontation to a 
purely procedural protection and a markedly hollow one at that 
he was joined by justice thurgood marshall 
justice anthony m kennedy who became a member of the court 
thursday did not take part in the decision 
the case is us vs owens 86877

a young mentally ill man egged into a suicide 
attempt by his mother apparently cured his phobia of germs and 
obsession for handwashing by shooting himself in the head doctors 
said 
the 22caliber slug destroyed the section of the brain 
responsible for his disabling obsessivecompulsive behavior without 
causing any other brain damage to the man a straighta student 
his doctor said 
the afflicted man tried to kill himself five years ago when he 
was 19 said psychiatrist leslie solyom of shaughnessy hospital in 
vancouver british columbia 
victims of the disorder typically have an inexplicable 
compulsion to repeat activities over and over 
the man identified only as george in a report in physicians 
weekly and the british journal of psychiatry washed his hands 
hundreds of times a day and took frequent showers solyom said the 
behavior forced him to drop out of school and quit his job 
solyom treated george for more than a year before he attempted 
suicide 
george was also very depressed and told his mother that his 
life was so wretched that he would rather die solyom said 
parents of obsessivecompulsives particularly mothers often 
have cruel streaks he said 
she said so look george if your life is so wretched just 
go and shoot yourself so george went to the basement stuck a 
22caliber rifle in his mouth and pulled the trigger 
the bullet lodged in the left front lobe of the brain surgeons 
removed it but could not get out all the fragments 
when he was transferred to our hospital three weeks later he 
had hardly any compulsions left solyom said 
after brain surgery to remove the bullet he showed no signs of 
his former obsession the doctor said he returned to school got a 
new job and is now in his second year of college having retained 
the same iq as he had before the illness struck solyom said 
mondays edition of physicians weekly wryly described the 
failed suicide attempt as successful radical surgery 
the story was also reported in todays editions of the los 
angeles times 
the idea that a man could blow out part of his frontal lobe 
and have his pathological symptoms cured is quite remarkable but 
it is not beyond belief said psychiatrist thomas ballantine of 
massachusetts general hospital in boston 
what made the case so very interesting was that we had 
measured iq and done a lot of other tests before the suicide 
attempt solyom said afterward we compared results and he had 
not lost anything we used very sensitive tests to measure brain 
damage and could find none 
new research indicates that as much as 3 percent of the us 
population displays some obsessivecompulsive behavior according 
to psychiatrist michael jenike of harvard university 
conventional psychotherapy is useless in such victims jenike 
said the disorder is most effectively treated with a combination 
of antidepressant drugs and behavioral therapy 
as a last resort neurosurgeons will occasionally remove part of 
the left front lobe of the brain where the obsessive behavior is 
thought to originate the operation is probably performed between 
10 and 30 times per year in the united states ballantine said 
with mixed results

time is running out for longterm illegal 
aliens to apply for amnesty under a yearlong program us attorney 
general edwin meese warned 
the deadline for applications under the legalization program is 
may 4 and meese said monday there probably wont be an extension 
we have 73 days and thats plenty of time for anybody who is 
eligible to get their application in meese said at a news 
conference at a san diego neighborhood ins office he refused to 
discuss topics other than immigration 
the immigration reform and control act of 1986 allows aliens who 
have lived continuously in the united states since 1981 or before 
to apply for residency with the immigration and naturalization 
service 
my hope in being here today is to dramatize both the 
importance of the process the desire of the us government to 
confer legalization on everybody who is eligible and to urge 
everyone in the category to apply as soon as possible meese said 
meese who oversees the ins as the nations top domestic law 
enforcement official refused to comment on israeli foreign 
minister shimon peres recent assertion that he wrote the attorney 
general in 1985 about a controversial iraqi oil pipeline project 
im here to talk about immigration today and thats the only 
topic thats appropriate meese said 
immigration officials have made tremendous strides in 
handling amnesty applications from nearly 13 million people 
nationwide said meese who called the program one of the justice 
departments key activities 
the attorney general handed temporary residency cards to eight 
aliens who now must wait 18 months before completing the 
legalization process

the supreme court today limited the job 
protection for government workers fired for lacking security 
clearances 
by a 53 vote the justices agreed with the reagan 
administration that the merit systems protection board lacks 
authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is 
justified 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said it 
should be obvious that no one has a right to a security clearance 
he said judgments about who should receive clearance must be 
made by those with the necessary expertise in protecting classified 
information and he said the board lacks that expertise 
the court ruled against thomas e egan who was hired in 1981 as 
a laborer at the trident naval refit facility in bremerton wash 
on the condition he subsequently receive a security clearance 
the facility is used to test and repair trident submarines all 
jobs at the facility require security clerance 
when he was denied the clearance because of two past criminal 
convictions egan was fired in 1983 
egan challenged the firing in an appeal to the merit systems 
protection board which was created by the civil service reform act 
of 1978 to protect federal civilian employees from unfair 
disciplinary treatement 
the board concluded that it lacked the authority to review 
egans case but a federal appeals court here overturned the 
boards decision and sent egans case back to the board for further 
study 
the reagan administration argued that the appeals court ruling 
threatened the governments ability to protect national security 
dissenting today were justices byron r white william j 
brennan and thurgood marshall 
white writing for the three said the governments interest in 
protecting its secrets would not be jeopardized by granting egan a 
hearing before the review board 
the majoritys decision frustrated congressional intent by 
denying any meaningful hearing to employees such as egan who are 
discharged on national security grounds he said 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the high court thursday 
did not take part in todays decision 
in other action the court 
ruled that a criminal suspects rights are not violated when a 
witness who is unable to identify the suspect in court testifies 
about an earlier identification of the accused 
the justices voting 62 ordered the reinstatement of the 
conviction of a california prison inmate in the beating of a prison 
guard who suffered memory loss because of the attack 
ruled unanimously that businesses may not be sued in federal 
court for refusing to contribute to multiemployer union pension 
funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires 
in an 80 ruling the court rejected reagan administration 
arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases could undermine the 
solvency of the multiemployer pension plans 
the security case is navy vs egan 861552

the marine corps has charged two 
women officers with fraternization and indecent acts with other 
female troops at the training base here a spokesman said 
maj robert w mclean public affairs officer at the marine 
corps recruit depot at parris island said a sergeant and a captain 
in the fourth recruit training battalion were charged friday with 
violations of several articles under the uniform code of military 
justice 
he said charges against other women are being considered 
an article 32 hearing which is similar to a grand jury 
hearing has been scheduled for next week mclean said the 
purpose of this hearing is to inquire into the allegations and 
charges and recommend disposition 
the spokesman said the hearing could result in a recommendation 
for courtmartial administrative action or a recommendation that 
the charges be dropped 
charged were capt judy a gretch administrative officer for 
the battalion who has been in the marines since 1981 and sgt 
mary p kile a former drill instructor who has been in the marines 
since 1983 mclean said 
earlier this month the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled 
the armys ban on homosexual soldiers unconstitutional 
but mclean said the charges are not affected by the ruling 
they are not being charged with lesbianism but with indecent 
acts he said 
capt joanne schilling a public information officer for marine 
corps headquarters in washington said monday the corps policy on 
homosexuality is the same as that of the department of defense 
the uniform code states that homosexuality is incompatible 
with military service and that certain overt acts are prohibited 
the marines do not knowingly enlist people who are homosexual 
and the type of action they take against marines who are found to 
be homosexual is left up to the commanding officer said lt col 
john shotwell it can range from an administrative discharge under 
honorable conditions to courtmartial which can include a 
military prison sentence 
three women who said they were being investigated told the state 
newspaper of columbia that the marine corps had planned to 
courtmartial or discharge as many as 10 women who train female 
recruits none of the women interviewed by the state were charged 
friday 
the women who spoke to the newspaper on the condition they not 
be identified said they and others have been accused of 
homosexuality sodomy and fraternization but have not yet been 
formally charged they said they are not homosexual 
parris island is one of two boot camps in the country where 
recruits are sent for an 11week basic training program and the 
only one to which women are sent 
of the 200000 marines roughly 10000 are women officials said

a new york city law aimed at forcing some 
large private clubs to admit women and racial minorities as members 
violates the fundamental right of our citizens to choose who 
their friends will be the supreme court was told today 
alan mansfield a lawyer for the new york state clubs 
association said the citys method not its objective was based 
on a fundamentally incorrect analysis of the freedom to 
associate 
the courts decision expected by july could carry an impact 
well beyond new yorks borders at least five other major cities 
have similar ordinances 
peter l zimroth chief lawyer for new york city argued that 
mansfields clients have fabricated a constitutional case 
its their burden to show there are real clubs out there that 
would get hurt and they havent zimroth said 
both mansfield and zimroth had their arguments repeatedly 
interrupted with questions from the justices including justice 
anthony m kennedy who joined the court last thursday and only 
recently resigned from a menonly club 
kennedy appeared particularly interested in the fact that the 
city law exempts some clubs such as the american legion and the 
protective order of elks 
justice harry a blackmun who also recently resigned from a 
maleonly club did not ask a question during the 60minute session 
at one point justice thurgood marshall suggested that the city 
law may be a valid attempt to battle bias pointedly telling 
mansfield you want to torpedo it 
the city law exempts distinctly private organizations from 
its antibias requirements 
but it deprives nonreligious groups of that designation if they 
have more than 400 members provide regular meal service and 
regularly receive payment of member dues from nonmembers such as 
employers 
similar ordinances were enacted recently in buffalo chicago 
detroit los angeles and san francisco 
new yorks highest court upheld the law rejecting arguments 
that it unconstitutionally creates an irrefutable presumption that 
such organizations are not truly private 
in previous rulings the supreme court has ruled that states 
through their public accommodations laws may force the us 
jaycees and rotary international to admit women as members 
in ruling unanimously in the rotary case last may the justices 
suggested that numerous other maleonly or femaleonly private 
organizations may have to comply with laws requiring equal access 
to public accommodations 
after assessing mays ruling kiwanis international voted to end 
its menonly tradition and allow its 8200 clubs worldwide to admit 
women 
the new york state club association is composed of about 125 
private clubs and associations many of its groups are maleonly or 
are organized along national origin or other ethnic lines 
its challenge of the new york city law has been supported in the 
supreme court by among others the benevolent and protective order 
of elks the loyal order of moose the improved order of red men 
and the club managers association of america 
the city law was defended by among others the us conference 
of mayors the council of state governments the national 
association of counties the national league of cities the 
american civil liberties union and the american bar association 
kennedy the courts newest justice was criticized during his 
recent senate confirmation hearings for his past membership in 
exclusive private clubs 
kennedy quit san franciscos allmale allwhite olympic club 
after he was mentioned as a possible supreme court nominee he had 
been a member since 1962 
he quit the allmale sutter club in his hometown of sacramento 
calif eight years ago 
blackmun recently quit the cosmos club in washington dc 
where he had held a longtime membership the club bars women from 
becoming members 
the case is new york state club association vs new york city

selection of the site to house the planned 
44 billion super collider atom smasher has been delayed from 
july until late in the year energy secretary john herrington told 
congress today 
i would guess a preferred site would be selected in november 
or december herrington told the interior subcommittee of the 
house appropriations committee 
he was answering a question on whether the site would be chosen 
before or after the committee acts on the departments request for 
363 million in construction funds for the fiscal year beginning 
oct 1 
i dont see us making the decision before the committee must 
act herrington said 
but he said there was little risk in appropriating the money 
before site selection since there is nothing new in the 
technology 
outside the hearing room spokesman phil keif said they need 
more time but the department still hoped to hold to its original 
schedule of confirming the selection in january 1989 
the eagerly sought scientific installation would probe the 
secrets of matter by whirling beams of protons into each other at 
an energy 20 times what is available with current machines 
the most powerful current machine is the accelerator at batavia 
ill not far from the chicago district of subcommittee chairman 
rep sidney yates dill 
yates asked herrington to comment on a newspaper report of a 
study from a local group claiming that locating the new machine 
next to the batavia installation would save the government 33 
billion over the years through savings on components buildings 
computer programs and other facilities but herrington said he was 
unfamiliar with the study 
illinois texas arizona colorado michigan tennessee and 
north carolina remain in the competition to house the collider

bush the overall fundraising leader ended january with 92 
million in cash on hand and 811029 in obligations while dole had 
42 million and 654269 in bills to pay their latest financial 
statements show 
neither had any loans outstanding but the other gop contender 
rep jack kemp of new york took out 750000 in loans to get 
through the iowa and new hampshire contests this month 
among democratic candidates money leader michael dukakis had 
the most cash available 4 million 
besides his loan robertson reported contributions of 13 
million during january his report also listed as receipts the 65 
million in federal matching funds that he applied for but had said 
he might not use 
robertson had said he was philosophically opposed to the public 
financing system and his staff said he would only use matching 
funds if he needed to stay competitive 
robertsons campaign did not return calls monday night to answer 
questions about the loan by far the biggest borrowing of any 
campaign for the 1988 election 
robertson paid off a shortterm loan of 15 million that his 
attorney has said was secured with his matching funds hisreport 
showed 
the latest financial reports were due at the federal election 
commission on saturday but robertsons was not filed until late 
monday 
it showed that the new loan was taken out in january from sovran 
bank in chesapeake va at an interest rate of prime plus 1 
percent and was due to be repaid on feb 28 
the sizable expenditures on this months iowa and new hampshire 
contests and subsequent spending toward super tuesday are not 
reflected in the new reports which cover the period through jan 
31 
robertson has spent more than any other candidate against the 
overall spending ceiling which is set by election law at 27 
million for the primary season he reported spending 176 million 
against the cap 
bush conversely while raising more money than any other 
candidate has been watching his budget and has spent the least of 
any republican contender against the cap 
he reported spending 107 million against the ceiling compared 
with kemps 128 million and doles 135 million 
robertson also spent the most of any campaign in a single state 
1 million in texas compared with bushs 335743 and doles 
81645 
wealthy campaigns must keep from spending too much early in the 
campaign because they could leave themselves unable to spend money 
on later contests without going over the limit 
on the democratic side none of the candidates approached the 
cap with dukakis spending the most at 78 million 
the massachusetts governor also had the biggest democratic bank 
account at the beginning of this month 4 million with 511789 in 
bills to pay while the next nearest democrat sen al gore jr of 
tennessee had 2 million with 84248 in obligations 
sen paul simon dill borrowed 523674 in january and ended 
the month with a 691069 debt and only 401176 in the bank he 
raised 534259 in contributions for the month 19 million in 
matching funds and 523674 in loans 
rep richard gephardt dmo entered february with 820260 in 
debts and 172477 in cash on hand he collected 212702 in 
contributions and 19 million in matching funds during january 
aides for both gephardt and simon have said that fundraising 
picked up this month and that they have whittled down their debts 
gore had ignored iowa to concentrate on the super tuesday 
states but he raised very little money during the time the other 
candidates were campaigning hard in iowa and new hampshire 
he collected only 180746 in contributions during january in 
addition to the 18 million in matching funds he got his report 
showed 
dukakis raised 804839 in contributions and got 35 million 
matching funds 
democratic contender jesse jackson reported raising 610036 in 
donations plus 598021 in matching funds during january ending 
the month with 509978 in cash on hand and 354881 in obligations 
former colorado sen gary hart ended the month with 615547 in 
cash on hand and 24484 in debts after collecting 70303 in 
contributions and 937325 in matching funds 
kemp continued a handtomouth campaign ending january with a 
debt of 13 million after raising 1 million for the month 
however his political director charlie black said the debt would 
be wiped out when kemps federal mathching funds come in this month 
he insisted the campaign is not in financial trouble saying a 
heavy mail solicitation program and fundraising events are reaping 
about 400000 a week 
dole raised 12 million in contributions for january and got 
56 in matching funds while bush collected 767892 privately and 
got 64 million in matching funds 
most candidates got very large matching fund payments in january 
because that was the first months the money was released and the 
sums were based on the candidates fund raising for all preceding 
months 
candidates can get matching funds from the federal treasury for 
each contribution of 250 or less that they raise in private funds 
the matching fund is supported by the 1 checkoff on individual 
income tax returns

the supreme court rejecting claims by private 
landowners ruled today that the state of mississippi owns 
thousands of acres of oil and gasrich land near the states gulf 
coast 
by a 53 vote the justices said states may claim title to land 
beneath waters subject to the ties influence and not only land 
under navigable waters 
the ebb and flow of the tide not navigability determines the 
states ownership said justice byron r white for the court 
states have interests in lands beneath tidal waters which have 
nothing to do with navigation white said those interests range 
from protecting fishing to setting aside submerged land for 
reclamation for urban expansion he said 
it would be odd to acknowledge such diverse uses of public 
trust tidelands and then suggest that the sole measure of the 
expanse of such lands is the navigability of the waters over 
them white said 
the court rejected an appeal by private landowners and companies 
that included phillips petroleum and a partnership called cinque 
bambini 
they challenged the states claim to some 2400 acres of 
undeveloped property in hancock county miss 
the mississippi supreme court ruled in 1986 that the state has 
control over the land based on a grant from the federal government 
when mississippi became a state in 1817 
the private landowners and companies based their claims on 
spanish land grants of 1813 
the state leased 600 acres of the land to saga petroleum us 
inc in 1977 for oil and gas exploration 
the mississippi court said the states title extends to all land 
subject to tidal influence inland to the mean high water mark 
the lands in question underly nonnavigable bayous and streams 
several miles north of the gulf coast they are influenced by the 
tide since they are affected by the ebb and flow of an adjacent 
navigable river that flows into the gulf 
dissenting today were justices sandra day oconnor john paul 
stevens and antonin scalia 
oconnor writing for the three said todays ruling will break 
a chain of title that reaches back more than 150 years and 
will disrupt the settled expectations of landowners not only in 
mississippi but every coastal state 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court on thursday 
did not take part in the decision 
the case is phillips petroleum vs mississippi 86870

people magazine paid judith campbell exner 
50000 for interviews in which she claimed to have served as a 
courier and contact for president kennedy and a chicago mobster 
the author of the article says 
kitty kelley said monday that she and exner who claims to have 
arranged at least 10 meetings between kennedy and mafia boss sam 
giancana in the early 1960s split a fee of about 100000 
parts of exners story were questioned today by giancanas 
daughter antoinette the author of mafia princess 
ms giancana said on cbs this morning that she never met 
exner but knew that she was her fathers girlfriend and she said 
that her father wanted to help in the alleged assassination plot 
against cuban leader fidel castro 
but she said that as far as she knew her father never spoke to 
kennedy during his time in the white house 
he always told us about people hed been with and met she 
told the new york post in an interview but not once did he say 
anything about meeeting kennedy im sure dad would have said 
something 
moreover my father had an utter contempt for the kennedys 
why would he ever want to meet with jfk in the white house or 
anywhere else she said on the cbs program 
ms giancana said her father did not need kennedys help but 
that kennedy needed giancanas help in chicago while he was running 
for president 
she told cbs it was possible that kennedy asked exner to go to 
giancana and ask for help but how probably i really dont 
know 
questioning exners account that giancana gave her a note to 
deliver to kennedy ms giancana said her father did not put things 
in writing the man had at least a little class he never put 
anything in writing where they could bring it up or show it from 
the day he had written it 
kelley said she first arranged to talk to exner about kennedy 
and giancana in 1983 but plans fell through after exner demanded 
at the last minute to be paid 
i told her i dont pay for interviews dont you just want 
to be honest and tell the truth kelley recalled but i didnt 
get the story because i wouldnt pay this time people did it 
kelley said payment was justified now because exner has terminal 
cancer and the story is a little piece of history 
elizabeth wagner publicity manager at people said the magazine 
had no comment on the fee 
columnist liz smith reported in her column in todays new york 
daily news that she put kelley and exner together smith said she 
did not pursue exners story herself because for exners sake i 
couldnt afford to 
she is suffering from terminal cancer she needs the money to 
live out her days and pay medical bills and only a magazine like 
people can pay the big bucks needed to offer up such a story 
in a 1975 appearance before the senate intelligence committee 
exner said she had an 18month affair with kennedy before and after 
he entered the white house and that she later had an affair with 
giancana but she said she knew of no ties between the two and 
that kennedy never knew of her friendship with giancana which 
predated her affair with kennedy 
in an interview monday on abcs good morning america exner 
said she changed her story because things have changed 
dramatically for me ive had two bouts with cancer and ive just 
had my lung removed and ive been given a fairly short length of 
time to live and i was being very uncomfortable with not being 
able to tell the truth 
in 1975 i was afraid for my life so i was afraid to tell the 
truth she said my husband and i made a very coscious decision 
not to tell the story 
exner said she witnessed one of the giancanakennedy meetings 
and that she carried envelopes on many occasions between kennedy 
and giancana and johnny roselli giancanas lieutenant in las 
vegas nev and southern california she said giancana once told 
her he had met kennedy in the white house 
kelley said kennedy apparently wanted mob assistance to win the 
presidency in 1960 and later to eliminate cuban leader fidel 
castro 
giancana was murdered in 1975 roselli a year later 
kelley said exner produced airplane tickets hotel bills and 
appointment books from 1960 through 1962 to support her story 
white house telephone logs show she had more than 70 conversations 
with kennedy 
jeff smith spokesman for sen edward kennedy dmass said 
there has been no comment and there probably will not be a 
comment from the kennedy family 
g robert blakey a professor of law at the university of notre 
dame and an expert on organized crime said he found exners story 
incredible 
the president of the united states dealing directly with a 
mobster and no one knowing around him knowing about it he asked 
blakey a former justice department lawyer who worked for the 
house committee that investigated kennedys assassination said 
congressional investigators in the 1970s verified exners reports 
of her affair with kennedy 
but he said my judgment was that she gave all the 
information she had at that time

president reagan stands behind attorney 
general edwin meese iii in the face of disclosure of a memo to 
meese about payments to israeli officials which would be denied 
everywhere the white house said today 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater was questioned by 
reporters about the memo which was disclosed on monday lawyers 
for meese said the memo gave no reason to conclude that the 
attorney general knew of any plans to bribe israeli officials 
ed meese has been a friend and adviser of the president for 
years and years going back to california fitzwater said he 
knows him to be a man of integrity and he stands behind him 
the memo from longtime meese friend e robert wallach described 
a plan to funnel a portion of some 650 million700 million from 
an iraqi pipeline project to the israeli labor party of thenprime 
minister shimon peres 
the wallachmeese memo is the focal point of a criminal 
investigation of the attorney general at issue is whether meese 
knew of a possibly improper payment plan involving the israeli 
political party and if so why he did nothing about it 
fitzwater turned aside most questions about the case saying it 
was inappropriate to comment while it was under investigation by 
the independent counsel 
asked whether reagan wanted meese to remain as attorney general 
fitzwater said absolutely hes a good man who does good work 
the president has full confidence in the attorney general and 
we dont have any comment on the documents or the case the 
spokesman said 
swiss oilman bruce rappaport was a partner in the proposed 
pipeline and wallach was his lawyer backers of the project were 
seeking assurances that israel would not bomb the 1 billion 
pipeline which was to run through iraq and jordan 
wallachs sept 25 1985 memo to meese said that rappaport had 
confirmed with peres that israel will receive somewhere between 
6570 million a year for ten years out of the conclusion of this 
project 
what was also indicated to me and which would be denied 
everywhere is that a portion of those funds will go directly to 
labor said the twopage memo which wallach marked personal amp 
confidential for your eyes only 
meeses lawyers released the memo monday along with a 
handwritten note from peres to meese in which the israeli leader 
said of the pipeline project i would go a long way to help it 
out but then discretion is demanded on our part 
peres said today that israel never opposed laying an iraqi 
pipeline through jordan so why would anyone need to use bribes 
the foreign minister told reporters as he toured a west bank 
city that no new documents were published that cause me concern 
and i have nothing to say 
but he added we all agree that we favor the laying of the 
pipeline so why would anyone need to use bribes nobody said he 
meese gave the labor party anything or proposed anything to the 
labor party 
peres who had initially denied that he had written a letter to 
the us attorney general said sunday that he used the highly 
unusual diplomatic channel of going through meese because i was 
approached by people who told me that the attorney general will 
deal with it 
in his letter to meese peres said i have asked my friend 
bruce rappaport and bob wallach to let you know the whole story 
and i shall depend on your judgment about the best way to handle 
this matter 
peres denies he was offered a bribe or anything of value in 
connection with the pipeline project 
independent counsel james mckay who has been investigating the 
attorney general since last may 11 is trying to determine whether 
meese violated the foreign corrupt practices act that law 
prohibits us citizens from bribing foreign officials and gives 
the attorney general responsibility for enforcing the ban 
in releasing the memo one of meeses lawyers nathan lewin 
said in a lengthy statement that no one can fairly infer that mr 
meese or anyone else reading the document should have understood 
that there was a bribe or payoff scheme to obtain the israeli 
labor partys support for the pipeline project 
the words which would be denied everywhere did not imply 
illegality of any kind lewin added 
the fact that rappaport intended to provide large amounts of 
financial support to the labor party or that through some other 
governmental arrangement the labor party would be receiving 
indirectly some of the projects proceeds could cause political 
embarrassment in israel and was obviously not a matter to be 
publicized the statement said 
mr wallach frequently used colorful phrases suggesting 
intrigue and secrecy in his memoranda even on subjects that were 
patently innocuous 
lewin said the most reasonable inference is that bruce 
rappaport who had been a substantial financial supporter of the 
labor party would be sharing the large amounts of money he would 
receive as a result of the oil lifter rights he held with the 
government of israel and with the labor party 
the oil lifter rights placed rappaport in control of the actual 
production and sale of the oil in return rappaport was to make 
available to israel substantial amounts of the oil generated from 
the pipeline 
iraq eventually backed out of the pipeline project and it was 
not built 
meese has said he doesnt recall reading the reference in the 
wallach memo to payments to peres political party meese declined 
to comment on the newly released documents at a news conference 
monday in san diego calif where he was attending a meeting of 
us attorneys 
meeses lawyers said they decided to release the material 
because speculation in the media has so greatly exceeded 
reasonable bounds that the usual policy of confidentiality gives 
the public a misleading impression 
the documents reveal that wallach was urging meese to take an 
active role in the project 
in a second wallachmeese memo released monday wallach hinted 
that meese might speak to secretary of state george shultz about 
the project and that the involvement of thennational security 
adviser robert mcfarlane was needed 
i know it goes without saying that a discussion of this 
subject with the president would be most desired and i would think 
most effective said wallach 
meeses lawyers said the attorney general took none of the 
initiatives suggested by mr wallach in a note to peres dated 
oct 7 1985 meese referred peres to mcfarlane saying shultz had 
removed himself from the matter because he had worked for bechtel 
group inc which was planning to build the project

the supreme court in a victory for three 
midwestern states today limited the secretary of the interiors 
authority to allocate water stored in missouri river basin 
reservoirs 
the justices ruled unanimously that the interior secretary 
exceeded his authority when in 1982 he approved a contract 
authorizing energy transportation systems inc etsi to take water 
from lake oahe in south dakota for a coal slurry pipeline project 
the court in an opinion written by justice byron r white said 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals was correct when in 1986 it 
ruled that the secretary lacks the power to allocate for industrial 
use water stored in the river basin reservoirs 
the reservoirs are not reclamation projects as defined by a 1944 
federal flood control law giving the interior department power to 
regulate reclamation and irrigation projects white said 
agreeing with the 8th circuit court white said the army corps 
of engineers was given primary authority over flood control and 
navigation under the 1944 act federal officials had to get 
permission from the corps of engineers before removing water from 
lake oahe in 1982 white said 
the decision is a victory for officials in missouri iowa and 
nebraska three states in the lower missouri river basin those 
states had blocked the nowscraped pipeline project 
as envisioned by the interior department etsi would have moved 
lake oahe water to wyoming where it would have been mixed with 
locally mined coal the slurry then would have been piped for use 
in coalfired steam generating power plants in the southeast 
three states in the upper missouri river basin north and south 
dakota and wyoming opposed the 8th circuit courts ruling and had 
supported the reagan administration and etsi the upper basin 
states said the appeals court ruling deprived them of using water 
within their boundaries 
when the case was aired before the justices last november one 
lawyer portrayed it as a dispute between upper and lower basin 
states 
the case is etsi pipeline project vs missouri 86939 and 
86941

spring is right around the corner and that can 
only mean one thing car dealers putting on an extra push for sales 
well ok there are other signs of spring among them the 
arrival of the first seed catalog followed by robins and other 
birds to munch the seeds but sales by auto dealerships are right 
up there 
the average new car costs more than 12000 and is generally the 
second most costly purchase made by americans and when that much 
money is involved some time and effort is called for to get the 
most for the money 
as with most things be prepared car salesmen have a lot more 
practice at selling than most people do at buying and allowing 
them to push you into a hasty decision can be a costly error 
think in advance about what kind of car you want and how much 
you can afford to pay and make a trip to a library to check books 
and magazines on new car features and prices 
shopping around is important to get prices from various dealers 
and make notes of the base cost they cite and the extra costs for 
options plus any dealer charges and other costs 
if the car you want isnt available consider ordering one it 
may take longer but you can avoid paying for a lot of options you 
dont want 
and insist on negotiating on the price check with consumers 
union publisher of consumer reports magazine for car prices for 
a charge cu will provide a printout on any type of auto citing 
the dealers actual cost for the car and options knowing this 
information can give you a real negotiating edge 
the federal trade commission has put together a new car buying 
guide for shoppers which includes a handy worksheet for shoppers 
to compare prices and options they want copies of the new car 
buying guide are available at no charge from the public reference 
branch federal trade commission 6th street and pennsylvania ave 
washington dc 20580 
a variety of autorelated booklets are also available from the 
consumer information center pueblo colo 81009 these include 
buying a used car item 440t 50 cents a consumers guide to 
vehicle leasing item 441t 50 cents and cost of owning and 
operating autos and vans item 442t 50 cents 
the ftcs new car guide includes a helpful list of price terms 
that you should know when negotiating these include 
invoice price the manufacturers initial charge to the dealer 
this is usually higher than the dealers final cost because dealers 
often receive rebates allowances discounts and incentive awards 
the invoice price always includes freight also known as 
destination and delivery if you are buying a car based on the 
invoice price be sure freight is not added to the sales contract 
base price the cost of the car without options but including 
the standard equipment factory warranty and freight 
monroney sticker price this is the price on the label attached 
to the car window and is required by law it shows the base price 
the manufacturers installed options with the manufacturer suggested 
retail price the manufacturers transportation charge and the fuel 
economy this label may not be removed by anyone other than the 
buyer 
the monroney sticker price was named for the late sen mike 
monroney dokla who sponsored the legislation requiring it 
dealer sticker price usually on a supplemental sticker this is 
the monroney sticker price plus the suggested retail price of 
dealerinstalled options additional dealer markup additional 
dealer profit dealer preparation and undercoating

congressional auditors said today a very 
preliminary survey indicates taxpayers are getting correct 
responses only 61 percent of the time when they telephone tax 
questions to the internal revenue service 
however the general accounting office which conducted the 
survey acknowledged that it is so incomplete that the results may 
not be valid 
irs commissioner lawrence b gibbs told a house ways and means 
subcommittee that a much more thorough check by the irs itself 
has found telephone assistors are giving the correct answer 
748 percent of the time 
we are obviously not satisfied with answering three out of 
four questions correctly at this time gibbs said we are not 
however totally surprised by our figures the large number of 
tax law changes this year was bound to challenge our assistors 
despite our training and planning efforts 
the commissioner noted that it is not just irs employees who are 
having trouble finding all the correct answers he cited a survey 
of 50 tax professionals who came up with 50 different answers when 
asked by money magazine to calculate the taxes owed by a 
hypothetical family 
gibbs noted that the 748percent accuracy rate by irs telephone 
answerers this year compares with a 79percent mark in a gao survey 
last year before most provisions of the landmark 1986 tax overhaul 
had taken effect 
jennie s stathis associate director of the gao an 
investigative arm of congress told the subcommittee that under 
the circumstances we believe irs did a good job in trying to 
prepare its employees and the taxpaying public for the 1988 filing 
season 
she said auditors found that 84 percent of taxpayers who visited 
irs walkin facilities for help with their tax returns were 
satisfied with the assistance and that 74 percent received help 
within 15 minutes 
however ms stathis said the gao found the need for irs to 
improve the accuracy of telephone assistor responses to assure that 
returns are completed accurately and processed timely 
she ackowledged that the gao in checking the accuracy of irs 
telephone assistors had made only 224 calls over six days and 
said the results were so preliminary that they could not be 
projected as an accurate sampling those calls produced correct 
responses 61 percent of the time although 4 percent were not 
complete 
the gao survey is continuing as is the irs own effort to check 
how its employees are doing in contrast the irs finding of 748 
percent accuracy is based on more than 5000 calls

a drifter shot two plainclothes 
policemen with one of their guns in a struggle on a downtown 
street then took refuge in an office building where he held six 
hostages before surrendering police said 
police officer ed gorrell 33 was shot in the head and was in 
serious condition today after surgery at brooke army medical 
center hospital spokesman staff sgt king lance said 
officer onofre serna 26 suffered a graze to the chest area and 
was in stable condition at medical center hospital hospital 
spokeswoman ruby salazar said 
the suspect identified as david johnson 28 was charged with 
two counts of attempted capital murder and was in bexar county jail 
in lieu of 1 million bond said police spokesman sgt paul buske 
after the scuffle monday night with the policemen the gunman 
ran into a nearby office building and took the hostages buske said 
the officers stopped the individual and a struggle ensued 
one of the officers lost his weapon the suspect picked up the 
weapon and several shots were fired buske said 
police chief william gibson said the man made no demands when he 
took the hostages gibson said he didnt know immediately why the 
officers stopped him 
the gunman fled into the travis park plaza building took two 
people hostage on one floor released them and then took three 
other people hostage on the third floor the three escaped when the 
gunman walked into another area to take a sixth hostage buske said 
the gunman surrendered to police shortly before 10 pm about 
an hour after he released the last hostage following talks with 
police negotiators said buske 
he seemed disoriented at first despondent that he had gotten 
framed hostage jerry renaud said today he said he wasnt 
there to hurt us he said he just needed a place to hide out for 
the night 
the man was described as a street person by city manager lou fox 
my understanding is he the gunman had some mental problems 
and its your typical downtown problem that weve been faced 
with fox said 
gorrell and serna were part of a downtown foot patrol aimed at 
deterring street crime buske described the patrol as effective in 
combating downtown muggings 
last month a mentally ill homeless man shot and killed a dallas 
police officer in a downtown parking lot the killing touched off a 
wave of public support for police when dallas police chief billy 
prince blamed some city council members for creating an atmosphere 
that led to the shooting by criticizing police

the house foreign affairs committee today 
approved a resolution of support for el salvadors upcoming 
elections but only after lawmakers expressed reservations about 
the countrys human rights record 
on a voice vote the panel approved a resolution noting el 
salvadors efforts since 1979 to establish a constitutional system 
that institutionalizes an electoral process and recognizing the 
large turnout in 1984 for the election of president jose napoleon 
duarte despite threats of violence 
the resolution sent to the full house for a vote expresses 
confidence that the people of el salvador will reject efforts to 
disrupt the election scheduled for march 20 to select national 
legislators and local officials 
past elections have been plagued by threats of disruption and 
warnings to voters not to participate made by the leftist farabundo 
marti national liberation front which is waging a guerrilla war 
against the duarte government 
the bill was watered down slightly after rep ted weiss dny 
objected to phrasing flatly stating that el salvador has achieved a 
system which respects human liberties the bill was changed to 
say only that the country has sought to establish such a system 
give them a little credit for trying ted said committee 
chairman dante fascell dfla 
weiss referred to reports that rightist death squads have 
resumed their activities in recent months and noted that the 
countrys judicial system has failed to live up to us hopes

a federal judge ruled today that a confession 
by a suspected lebanese shiite terrorist that he had led the 1985 
hijacking of a jordanian airliner was illegally obtained by the fbi 
us district judge barrington d parker who sharply criticized 
the fbis interrogation suppressed the oral and written 
confessions that fawaz younis made to federal agents following his 
sept 13 1987 arrest in the mediterranean after he was lured 
aboard an fbichartered yacht off cyprus 
younis a former member of the shiite amal militia is scheduled 
to stand trial march 22 on charges he had led the june 11 1985 
hijacking of a royal jordanian airliner from beirut international 
airport 
the plane was flown to several points in the mediterranean and 
destroyed by explosives the next day after passengers and crew were 
taken off the jetliner 
parker ruled that fractures younis suffered on both wrists when 
he was slammed to the deck of the yacht by fbi agents plus 
seasickness made it impossible for him to waive rationally his 
rights against selfincrimination 
the judge also noted that the fbi deliberately kept younis 
aboard a navy ammunition ship for four days during which he 
underwent relentless interrogation 
the defendants will was overborne by the interrogation and 
his capacity for selfdetermination was critically impaired the 
judge said 
the judge sharply criticized the fbi for taking four days to 
transport younis from the yacht where he was seized to an aircraft 
carrier from which he was flown to washington for arraignment 
before a federal magistrate 
the slow voyage across the mediterranean appeared to serve 
only the governments purposes ample time to educe a confession 
this was a clear abuse of the obligation to bring the defendant 
before a judiciali officer immediately following his arrest 
parker said 
justice department spokesman patrick korten said the agency had 
no immediate comment on parkers decision 
federal prosecutors have other evidence against younis 
including a videotape of him reading a statement to reporters 
before the plane was blown up at the beirut airport 
two americans who were aboard the plane when it was stormed by 
five gunmen carrying ak47 assault rifles have identified younis as 
leader of the hijackers 
in addition the prosecutors will be able to use the testimony 
of jamal hamdan a friend of younis who lured him to the 
fbichartered yacht off cyprus on the pretext of completing a drug 
deal 
parker found that younis was in an extremely weakened physical 
condition at the very time when he was explained his rights in an 
uncertain physical condition in an oppressive environment and 
subject to relentless interrogation younis lacked the will 
necessary to voluntarily waive his rights 
the judge noted that the government had deliberately scheduled 
four days for the voyage across the mediterranean four days which 
younis would be subjected to constant questioning by agents 
while ruling the confession was illegally obtained parker 
dismissed a defense motion that youniss arrest was illegal

a white supremacist group considered 
dumping enough cyanide to kill 440000 people into the water 
supplies of new york or washington dc to create civil unrest 
the groups former leader testified 
james b ellison a key prosecution witnesses in the trial of 10 
men accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the government 
said one of the defendants robert miles gave him a 30gallon 
barrel of cyanide and declared 
the ones who would be killed would not really matter it would 
be a good cleansing 
ellison also testified that in 1983 members of a white 
supremacist group he led had participated in a murder robberies 
and attempts to blow up utility facilities 
ellison is serving 20 years for racketeering and weapons 
violations committed when he led the arkansasbased 
religiousmilitary group called the covenant the sword and the 
arm of the lord he was arrested in 1985 after a fourday standoff 
ellison 47 said monday he agreed to cooperate with prosecutors 
after the government agreed to relocate and give new identities to 
the two women he considers to be his wives and to his nine children 
miles and nine others are charged with conspiracy to overthrow 
the government by force the government alleges that they and four 
others on trial including aryan nations leader richard butler 
espouse white supremacist goals or belong to white supremacist 
groups 
those four and one of the accused conspirators are charged 
with plotting to kill a federal judge and an fbi agent two are 
also accused of interstate transportation of stolen money all the 
defendants face maximum sentences of 20 years in prison and 20000 
fines on each charge if convicted 
returning to the witness stand today ellison said that richard 
wayne snell a member of his group murdered william stumpp on nov 
11 1983 in the robbery of a pawn shop that stumpp operated in 
texarkana ark 
this is what they were doing at that time ellison said 
referring to occasional forays involving robberies and attempts to 
disrupt utilities 
ellison said he asked snell later why snell had killed stumpp 
he said that he was an evil man he was a jew and that he 
just needed to die ellison testified 
snell one of the defendants in the case is on death row in 
arkansas for the murder of stumpp and is serving a sentence of 
life without parole for the 1984 slaying of state trooper louis 
bryant 
ellison said the robberies were undertaken because of an 
agreement made in 1983 at hayden lake idaho by himself and 
leaders of other whitesupremacist groups to take action designed 
to bring down the government so that an allwhite state could be 
established in the nations northwest 
in his testimony monday ellison described how defendants 
william wade and his son ray wade solicited the groups help to 
find and kill us district judge h franklin waters and fbi 
special agent jack knox both of fayetteville 
he said the wades wanted to avenge the slaying of a fugitive tax 
protester gordon kahl who was killed along with an arkansas 
sheriff in a 1983 shootout with federal authorities at a house on 
land owned by william wade 
knox helped prosecute people who harbored kahl and waters 
presided over the trial 
ellison said ray wade urged that local officials involved in 
kahls death be hanged publicly from the lamp post there in 
smithville 
the idea ellison said was to make an example of them so that 
other officials would not take similar actions 
ellison testified that miles 63 of cohoctah mich gave him 
the barrel of cyanide after ellison participated in a survivalist 
conference in dearborn mich in 1981 ellison said he also 
received some chemicals to make explosives and rocket propellant 
he said he was wary of transporting it but miles told him 
you might need it sometime it will kill a lot of people the 
government says the cyanide was enough to kill 440000 people 
ellison testified that he miles and defendants louis ray beam 
jr 41 of houston and butler 69 of hayden lake idaho 
discussed in 1983 using the cyanide to poison the water supplies of 
new york or washington dc in an attempt to create public unrest 
and show the government was powerless

eli wallach has deemed barbra streisand nuts 
not exactly but as dr herbert a morrison in the movie 
nuts wallach portrays a psychiatrist who is truly convinced 
that claudia draper a former call girl accused of murder is 
insane and therefore must be locked away streisand as draper 
believes otherwise 
as a heavy i am not well liked in the movie wallach said 
but i approached the character with the conviction that he is a 
professional and he made this diagnosis based on years of 
experience the more this girl rants and raves the more i am 
convinced of my diagnosis 
the consummate professional wallach has brought to the screen 
more than 40 years of acting experience 
you know originally i prepared for a teaching career but due 
to several circumstances i missed the exam he said so i 
decided to do what i most wanted to do and that was to act 
he began his career with a scholarship to the neighborhood 
playhouse in new york and made his first appearance in the equity 
library production of tennessee williams this property is 
condemned 
this became an important turning point in wallachs life for 
the only other performer in the show happened to be the actress 
anne jackson who later became his wife 
wallach made his broadway debut in 1945 in skydrift a 
shortlived production but soon thereafter he was cast in the 
broadway production of mister roberts which starred henry 
fonda and ran for two years 
he then went on to receive a tony award for tennesse williams 
the rose tattoo 
its a shame that shows have become so expensive here in new 
york because we would have less problems if everybody were able to 
go to the theater rich poor black white minorities 
everbody he said 
theater is not a luxury but a necessity for theater helps 
people understand the human condition 
this belief in the power of theater to reach out to people has 
led wallach through many plays in his long career including 
camino real henry viii antony and cleopatra waltz 
of the toreadors luv and the teahouse of the august moon 
wallachs movie career began with elia kazans debut as a 
director in baby doll in 1956 for which he won britains 
highest film acting honor 
i used to sneer at the screen wallach said then i 
realized how hard it is 
a movie has many layers the director wields the baton and i 
play the instrument although its a lot of hard work i have fun 
and thats important 
let me tell you this he continued the most important 
things in life are the right partner and your work if you find a 
lifelong partner and you love your work you are a most fortunate 
person 
the 72yearold wallach has indeed been fortunate he and 
jackson have raised two daughters and a son he has also appeared 
in aproximately 50 motion pictures since baby doll he is most 
recognized for his role in the spaghetti western the good the 
bad and the ugly 
people all over the world still come up to me on the streets 
and mention that movie with clint eastwood he said 
his other films include the magnificent seven the 
misfits how the west was won cinderella liberty the 
deep and tough guys 
his most recent tv appearances include the executioners 
song and an hbo movie the impossible spy 
even though hes busy with films and television hes also a 
spokesman for toyota trucks he still manages to keep one foot in 
the theater 
i am like a farmer who rotates his crops i always allocate a 
certain period of my time to go back to my roots the theater

the weeks campaign marked something of a break between new 
hampshires intensive leadoff primary a week ago and the highly 
visible southern contests ahead 
but for dole it marked an opportunity to demonstrate strength 
on the heels of his new hampshire loss and he taunted the vice 
president for not competing 
i dont know where george bush is he said in duluth 
were going to send him a map of minnesota so at least he gets a 
little idea where it is 
but bushs aides wanted no part of two states so close to iowa 
where the vice president finished a humbling third in caucuses two 
weeks ago instead the vice president spent his time in south 
carolina which votes on march 5 and in several super tuesday 
states 
dole enjoyed the support of sen larry pressler and gov george 
mickelson and was a prohibitive favorite in south dakota 
he looked for a boost from minnesota as well but sounded less 
confident of a victory there 
party officials said minnesota was tailormade for a robertson 
surprise noting his earlier success in organizational contests 
such as iowa where he finished a surprising second and in hawaii 
which he won robertson also was well known in the state because 
his onetime television program was viewed widely 
kemp his candidacy on the ropes after a weak third place finish 
in new hampshire purchased television advertising at the last 
minute in south dakota his aides conceded in advance that 
minnesota looked like a lost cause because of robertsons presumed 
strength 
among the democrats new hampshire primary winner dukakis 
dreamed of a twostate sweep midwestern sweep that would clearly 
establish him as a candidate with national appeal 
his rivals said he spent a fortune organizing minnesota leaving 
gephardt jackson and simon in his wake 
south dakota was another story and a heated one 
gephardt anxious for a victory aired television commercials 
attacking the governor the missouri congressman also won the 
endorsement of sen tom daschle and rushed a commercial onto the 
air trumpeting the news 
dukakis responded with a late radio advertisement responding to 
the attacks and pointing out that gephardt accepts political action 
committee campaign funds 
gore also invested in television advertising in south dakota to 
redeem his earlier declaration that he needed to demonstrate 
strength outside the south 
despite his initial statement that he needed a win this week to 
stay in the race simon changed course and vowed to fight for the 
heart and soul of the democratic party until the convention 
his aides conceded no victories were likely in either minnesota or 
south dakota 
jackson made little effort in south dakota but worked hard in 
minnesota in hopes of matching his doubledigit showing in the iowa 
caucuses next door 
hart said in advance he would stay in the race no matter where 
he finished

british travelers will no longer need a visa to 
visit the united states next year officials of both countries said 
tuesday 
the decision soothes a longstanding british irritation since 
britain does not require us visitors to have similar visas 
officials said the change is part of a pilot program to drop 
visa requirements for eight countries beginning with britain and 
japan they would not identify the other six 
there are a number of technical issues to be settled but we 
hope the new arrangement can come into force at the turn of the 
year said a spokesman for britains foreign office speaking 
anonymously in keeping with british custom 
a us embassy official said less than 2 percent of british and 
japanese visitors cause problems on us visits such as abusing 
the length of stay 
when the program is implemented british travelers will be 
required to have only a valid passport and a return ticket and can 
stay in the united states for a maximum of 90 days they will still 
be required to apply for a visa to work or live in the united 
states 
the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity that 
last year the embassy issued 690000 nonimmigrant visas to 
britons he said the number of british visitors was even higher 
because some traveled on multipleentry visas 
this year the embassy expects to process 900000 such visas he 
said

a fourday sickout by 110 providence 
firefighters ended today when the firefighters returned to work 
after being threatened with contempt of court 
but 35 of the firefighters were cited with contempt anyway by 
superior court judge americo campanella because they did not show 
up in court monday to explain why they were absent over the weekend 
campanella said there was no evidence that the firefighters had 
not acted in concert to stay off the job in violation of a 
backtowork order issued saturday by another judge he said he 
would decide on penalties at a later time 
the city had asked for the contempt citations even though the 
sickout was over in order to prevent something similar from 
happening in the future said city labor attorney vincent ragosta 
jr state law prohibits public safety employees from striking 
everythings back to normal fire chief michael f moise 
said today 
eightyseven firefighters who reported for duty friday evening 
were kept on the job during the sickout over a contract dispute no 
major fires occurred in the city during the fourday period 
on monday campanella postponed a hearing after ragosta and leo 
j miller president of the providence firefighters union 
indicated that relatively few members of the union had been 
notified of the temporary restraining order issued by another 
superior court judge at the citys request saturday 
miller testified he was only able to reach about half the 50 
firefighters scheduled to work sunday 
ragosta said the city served notices of the restraining order on 
129 firefighters another 36 were notified of mondays contempt 
hearing 
the union represents 450 of the citys total uniformed force of 
479 
the dispute apparently concerns language in a contract ratified 
by firefighters in december that the city has yet to sign 
miller asserts the city is trying to renege on a provision that 
calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit 
union members also complain that promises to replace wornout or 
damaged equipment like boots helmets and firecoats have not been 
fulfilled 
all but one of the 51 firefighters scheduled to report for work 
at 8 am saturday called in sick moise testified monday sixty 
others called in sick for the shift that was supposed to begin at 6 
am sunday moise said

gov evan mecham is as stubborn as a mule 
and cant govern the state former sen barry goldwater said today 
as he became honorary chairman man of john rhodes republican 
gubernatorial bid 
goldwater who backed mecham a fellow republican during the 
1986 campaign said at a news conference today that the endorsement 
was a mistake 
he screwed up too much he turned out wrong goldwater 
told reporters 
you look back over all the governors that weve had in this 
state said the senator who has been considered the patriarch of 
the arizona gop weve had some darn good ones and weve had 
some mediocre ones but it took us a long time to get a really bad 
one 
nonetheless goldwater said mecham will be difficult to beat in 
the may 17 recall election because he still has a strong core of 
support despite the governors indictment on criminal charges and 
upcoming impeachment trial 
rhodes a former 30year congressman will face mecham and 
democrat carolyn warner in the recall vote 
goldwater contended mecham was too wrapped up in defending 
himself against the impeachment and criminal charges during recent 
months to spend much time governing the state 
mecham gave up the acting governorship to democrat rose mofford 
when he was impeached on feb 5 his senate trial is scheduled to 
begin monday on charges of concealing a 350000 campaign loan 
misusing 80000 from the governors protocol fund by loaning it to 
his auto dealership and trying to thwart an investigation of an 
alleged death threat by a state official 
even if he could solve his legal problems however goldwater 
said he does not believe mecham can govern the state 
he is a very obstinate man goldwater said i used to 
drive mules and hes a lot like a mule 
goldwater said he doesnt see much difference between rhodes and 
mrs warner except that he believes rhodes has more experience

with briefing rules

any tamil civilians were killed she said the body of one tamil 
rebel was recovered and at least 10 more rebels were believed 
killed 
authorities clamped an indefinite curfew on the district after 
the violence broke out the sri lankan officials said they said

officials have a big selling job to do in 
this improverished town if 30 families are to get new homes the 
mayor says 
the families living in old shacks rusting trailers and leaning 
houses on tchulas north side are to get new homes in about a year 
but mayor david cotten says it is going to be hard to convince some 
that officials are trying to improve their quality of life and not 
swindle them 
theyre scared and you cant blame them cotten said the 
most devastating thing to fight is ignorance 
cotten and us rep mike espy were on hand monday for a 
groundbreaking ceremony on the site of a burnedout house in the 
middle of a fourblock strip targeted for revitalization 
were going to be tearing these down cotten said of the 
stretch of homes but this a drop in the bucket we want to 
change the face of tchula we want everyone to be a homeowner 
when farmworkers are idle unemployment in the central 
mississippi town of 2000 can reach 85 percent cotten said poor 
housing conditions are easily visible from the road 
with a 695832 community development block grant federal 
money allocated by the state city and state officials are to 
begin razing some homes in march and refurbishing others in place 
of the homes to be torn down 30 new singlefamily dwellings will 
be built 
residents who already own their land and homes will get the new 
homes free and renters will have a chance to buy homes through 
lowinterest programs cotten said 
the city also will use the money to pay half the rent of 
displaced homeowners during the renovations 
lillie may brooks 67 who lives alone in a home just a few feet 
from where ground was broken for the first new house was 
suspicious of the plans 
this house belongs to me and i dont want my house torn 
down said brooks as she sat on her porch this house suits me 
all right 
another resident jesse riley watched curiously from the road 
while officials spoke 
can they really take someones home he asked a bystander 
its nice but i dont see why they should take peoples 
property 
the mayor said many will change their minds as they understand 
the program 
we have a lot of people here with no education cotten said 
there are many who think youre going to steal their land

energy secretary john herrington told a house 
subcommittee tuesday he had been dealt a low blow by interior 
secretary donald p hodel through hodels interpretation of why 
herrington opposes one of hodels ideas 
herrington recommended that the panel not consider hodels 
request for funds for what he called the frivolous idea of 
removing the oshaughnessy dam in hetch hetchy valley in 
californias yosemite national park and draining the reservoir 
behind the dam 
the dam provides threequarters of san franciscos water the 
city earns about 38 million a year selling water and electricity 
from the reservoir 
rep sidney yates dill chairman of the house appropriations 
interior subcommittee said he found hodels idea strange and 
he had been shocked if not surprised that hodel proposed it 
last year 
yates read the opening paragraph of a news article about the 
feud between the two cabinet secretaries describing hodels belief 
that herrington was opposing removal of the dam because herrington 
was concerned about what it would do to his job prospects in 
california 
thats a low blow isnt it yates said 
it really is herrington replied 
what about this job youre going to get yates asked 
i dont know who fabricated that herrington said 
hodel has said the hetch hetchy valley filled by the reservoir 
from 1913 to 1923 could relieve some of the visitor pressure on 
yosemite valley which attracts more than 2 million people a year 
he has said the project could not be begun for years but is asking 
for 600000 in his budget for further studies 
yates asked herrington your recommendation to this committee 
would be not to consider an appropriation which would result in a 
change in the status of hetch hetchy 
herrington replied thats my recommendation 
as energy secretary i am concerned about destroying an 
infrastructure that produces a substantial amount of electricity 
he added 
the generating capacity about 150 megawatts eventually will 
have to be replaced and i just dont think enough thought has 
been given to the economic consequences herrington said 
herrington said his department estimated that removal of the dam 
and restoration of the valley could cost 5 billion to 6 billion 
a lot of money for a frivolous idea

afghan insurgents announced plans 
tuesday to replace the communist regime with an islamic government 
which they said would promote peace and ensure the safe withdrawal 
of soviet troops from afghanistan 
the guerrilla alliance said the civil war would not end until 
such a government was established to guide the way to a nation 
called the islamic state of afghanistan 
president najib responded that a new government should be formed 
after the soviets withdraw and is a matter for afghans alone 
kabul radio quoted najib as saying no one can direct the 
afghans on this or give their views 
his comments appeared to reflect the governments position that 
the issue of a coalition government should be settled within 
afghanistan not by guerrilla leaders in neighboring pakistan 
afghan guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet soldiers entered the country in december 1979 an 
estimated 115000 now are in the country helping fight the 
insurgents 
on feb 8 soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev offered to begin 
withdrawing troops may 15 if pakistan and afghanistan reach 
agreement by march 15 in unsponsored negotiations that resume in 
geneva next week he said the pullout could be accompalished in 10 
months 
islamic unity an alliance of seven guerrilla groups announced 
its plans for a government in a statement telexed from the border 
city of peshawar pakistan calling for a 28member cabinet to 
replace najibs government 
it said the government would consist of 14 ministers from the 
guerrilla leadership seven representatives of afghan refugees and 
seven moslems presently living in kabul 
insurgent leaders have said the moslems in kabul would include 
noncommunists in the current administration who have not been 
closely involved in the war 
in a separate statement alliance leader yunis khalis said as 
long as a single communist remains in power in kabul the regime 
will have to face the mujahedeen resistance until we have 
established an islamic government we will never lay down our 
arms 
about 35 million afghan refugees live in pakistan most are in 
border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply points for 
the guerrillas known as mujahedeen or holy warriors 
the alliance statement said a supreme council would be the 
governments highest body and oversee the cabinet its members 
would be leaders of the sevenparty alliance based in pakistan who 
would provide joint leadership during the interim period after 
moving to kabul 
this government is proposed to replace the present regime in 
kabul before the signing of the geneva accords under the auspices 
of the united nations and would represent all sections of the 
afghan nation the announcement said 
it said the chief cabinet minister also would be the head of 
state but it did not say who would hold the post or name proposed 
cabinet members 
another organ of government would be a consultative council of 
75 members two from each of the 28 provinces and 19 moslem 
religious scholars intellectuals and technocrats the statement 
said it said the council would make interim laws to apply until a 
new constitution was written 
provincial councils would be in charge of regional affairs 
the statement said an independent election commission would 
supervise the election of a constituent assembly immediately after 
the soviet withdrawal

a federal judge has ordered an investigation 
into why a doctor waited two months to disclose that one of three 
hemophiliac brothers exposed to the aids virus had been diagnosed 
with aidsrelated complex 
us district judge elizabeth kovachevich said in a court order 
monday that she has grave concerns with dr jerry barbosas 
statements to the press that he withheld the diagnosis out of 
respect for the privacy of the family of clifford and louise ray 
in a medical report filed feb 12 barbosa said ricky 11 and 
the oldest of the brothers was diagnosed with arc aidsrelated 
complex 
barbosa a physician at all childrens hospital in st 
petersburg told the st petersburg times that he knew of the 
diagnosis in december but didnt report it out of concern for the 
rays privacy the times said tuesday 
i left out a number of things on purpose the times quoted 
the doctor as saying 
in her order ms kovachevich asked a magistrate to find out 
what the doctor told a times reporter and who was aware of 
barbosas intentional omissions from the medical reports and when 
they were aware of the omissions 
in addition she said she wanted to know whether attorneys told 
the court any contradictory medical information and whether an 
independent doctor should be appointed 
last august the judge ordered the desoto county school board to 
reinstate the three ray boys ricky robert and randy the 
brothers all hemophiliacs were barred from class after they 
tested positive for antibodies associated with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome 
during a hearing last summer doctors said the boys probably 
were contaminated through plasma products used to clot their blood 
and showed no symptoms of having the disease 
the aids virus can remain dormant for years arc is found when 
the virus causes a set of symptoms that usually are considered a 
precursor to aids 
barbosa said in his feb 12 report that rickys condition 
appeared to be stable the boy has been treated with azt an 
antiaids drug 
the ray boys medical records are supposed to be on public file 
as a condition of the august injunction that returned them to 
school the family however fled desoto county a week after 
classes began because of a parental boycott bomb threats that 
emptied the school and a deliberate blaze that destoyed their home 
they now live in sarasota where the boys enrolled in school 
without objection from school officials although some parents 
objected 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their 
offspring

former defense secretary caspar weinberger became 
an honorary knight tuesday joining the illustrious ranks of the 
defenders of queen elizabeth iis realm 
the queen herself bestowed the medals on weinberger in a simple 
ceremony at buckingham palace but it doesnt mean he can call 
himself sir caspar caspar weinberger gbe will have to do 
in recommending him for the highest royal honor britain gives to 
foreigners prime minister margaret thatchers government was 
thanking weinberger for his defense of british interests 
especially during the 1982 falkland islands war with argentina 
when washington provided britain with crucial intelligence and 
logistics support 
but the unassuming weinberger professed amazement at the 
accolade when a reporter asked why he thought he had received it 
he replied i havent the faintest idea 
weinberger skipped the pomp and pageantry of a public 
investiture at buckingham palace in which the queen would have 
placed a ribbon of medals over his head before an audience of 
hundreds 
instead he chose a 25minute private audience with the queen 
attended only by his wife jane and foreign secretary sir geoffrey 
howe who had recommended him for the honorary knighthood 
as a foreigner weinberger didnt have to bow or scrape before 
the queen 
her majesty was nice enough just to present it to me he 
said pointing to the blue box he was holding 
weinberger opened it for photographers showing them the gold 
cross of the order of the british empire and the silver star of a 
knight grand cross the highest order of chivalry for a foreigner 
he did not put them on 
im very honored very pleased and still very astonished 
said weinberger who retired nov 5 after nearly seven years as 
president reagans defense chief 
when the award was announced on feb 1 reporters asked 
70yearold weinberger whether he was ready to be called sir 
cap he replied good god no our constitution has some harsh 
words about titles but i really am flattered 
actually the title of sir is reserved for british subjects 
weinberger was the 56th american to receive an honorary 
knighthood but only the second to receive a gbe the other knight 
grand cross was awarded in 1976 to hugh bullock president and 
chairman of pilgrims of the usa an angloamerican friendship 
society 
other americans who have been made knights of the british 
empire a lower rank of chivalry include president dwight d 
eisenhower former secretary of state dean rusk industrialist 
henry ford ii philanthropists paul mellon and john paul getty ii 
actors douglas fairbanks jr and sidney poitier and former sen j 
william fulbright dark who headed the senate foreign relations 
committee 
the foreign office said weinberger was being knighted for his 
outstanding and invaluable contribution to angloamerican 
defense cooperation especially his unfailing support and 
assistance during britains 74day campaign to oust argentinas 
invasion force from the falklands 
weinberger refused to say whether the queen had spoken about the 
falklands or defense she was very gracious as always and very 
generous in her remarks he said without elaborating 
the private meeting took place in the queens audience room 
where the 61yearold monarch has weekly talks with mrs thatcher 
and occasionally meets other officials it contains a piano and the 
blue walls are filled with paintings including two canalettos and 
two gainsboroughs 
weinberger who counts winston churchill among his heroes has 
longstanding ties to britain 
he made his debut as a british television commentator in 
december when the treaty which he helped secure eliminating 
shorter and mediumrange missiles was signed and he will be 
spending four weeks this summer as a distinguished visiting 
professor at edinburgh university 
asked whether the honorary knighthood had made him more of an 
anglophile weinberger replied well its hard to be not 
he then drove off with his wife to celebrate at a luncheon given 
by us ambassador charles price ii

the ussoviet treaty eliminating 
mediumrange nuclear missiles from europe wont hurt us efforts 
to provide hightech military help to nato the chief us 
negotiator said tuesday 
this treaty does not prohibit the transfer of technology 
maynard glitman testified before the senate armed services 
committee 
glitmans detailed analysis was part of a thorough examination 
of the pact signed 10 weeks ago by president reagan and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev the treaty will eliminate all 
nucleartipped missiles with ranges of about 300 to 3000 miles 
committee members say the detailed scrutiny is needed because of 
disputes about the meaning of past treaties particularly the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
the current treaty is being considered by the senate amid a 
fight between the democraticcontrolled congress and the reagan 
administration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact and 
whether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developed 
under the strategic defense initiative 
article 14 of the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty 
says neither side shall do anything now or in the future to 
undercut the pact 
sen dan quayle rind told glitman that im concerned about 
article 14 because it might limit future us help to other nato 
nations 
if we dont spell out what the future obligations are said 
quayle down the road i can foresee some problems now is the 
time to give us as much running room as possible in the future for 
our technology 
but glitman took the opposite approach noting that the treaty 
is extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons along 
with their components 
if it is not prohibited by the treaty we can do it said 
glitman later he added that were best protected by stating 
what we cannot do 
glitman said the voluminous negotiating record is the best 
defense against future disputes about what is and is not covered 
by the treaty 
he opposed suggestions by quayle and other senators that some 
type of amendment is needed to clarify article 14 
the section is a standard clause which has been added to other 
treaties and it simply restates the intention of both nations to 
abide by the pact glitman said 
glitman cited one method in which he said us aid to nato would 
not be affected the treaty bans cruise missiles he said but it 
doesnt block the transfer of us technology to nato nations such 
as great britain to develop cruise missiles 
glitman said the us negotiating team resisted soviet efforts 
to block us help for nato we knew their goal was to find a way 
to put a brake on nato activities he said 
reagan promised tuesday that the united states will do its part 
to ensure that the nato alliance remains strong saying in an 
address broadcast to europe that our destiny is coupled with 
yours 
in the address which came a week before a nato summit meeting 
reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any 
member nation is an attack against all of them simply put an 
attack on munich is the same as an attack on chicago he said

a top fbi official admitted today that some 
agents came very close to conducting a political investigation 
of antireagan activists but denied they intended to do so or 
received any instructions from the reagan administration 
oliver b revell executive assistant director told a senate 
panel there were legitimate reasons to investigate the committee in 
solidarity with the people of el salvador including possible links 
with salvadoranbased terrorists and discussions by cispes members 
of committing violent acts 
the investigation was closed down without any charges being 
filed and the bureau has now begun an investigation of its agents 
conduct cispes has said it was investigated because it opposes 
president reagans central america policies 
several members of the senate intelligence committee told revell 
they remained skeptical of the fbi information that triggered the 
investigation in march 1983 and fueled it until it closed in june 
1985 
sen arlen specter rpa the former district attorney of 
philadelphia said he has grave questions about revells 
justifications adding you have to proceed on the basis of 
tangible hard facts and evidence which he indicated were 
lacking in this case 
revell noting this was a terrorism investigation testily 
replied that if the fbi always waited until there was tangible 
evidence you would have been picking up the pieces of the bombs 
documents previously released in the probe show that fbi agents 
and informants sent to spy on cispes collected so much information 
on peaceful protest activities that bureau headquarters was worried 
that the investigation had gone too far 
the documents released under the freedom of information act 
have shown that while the investigation was targeted at cispes the 
files eventually included information on hundreds of other 
individuals and groups ranging from roman catholic nuns to union 
leaders who opposed reagan policies 
revell said that more than a year after the investigation began 
top fbi officials warned field offices about investigating 
legitimate political activity beause they sensed the conduct 
of some agents was very close to the line 
we may have seen some wavering over that line he said but 
maintained that the investigation was legitimate under the fbis 
foreign intelligence and counterintelligence guidelines 
he flatly denied that the administration ever tried to influence 
the investigation commenting theres been absolutely no contact 
by anyone in the administration concerning tasking opening or 
closing of the investigation 
in defending the probe revell testified that in addition to 
possible violence cispes was involved in circulating forged us 
documents and had strong ties to the us communist party 
some have insinuated that this investigation was politically 
motivated as many individuals associated with cispes were opposed 
to reagan administration policies in central america revell 
said nothing could be further from the truth 
we did find indications that some cispes members were at least 
discussing and planning violence our investigtions uncovered one 
cispes member who was tasked to determine response times of 
emergency services in a major american city another cispes member 
stated he had developed a system to shut down a public utility in a 
major midwestern city as well as plans to violently disrupt the 
1984 republican convention 
the bureau initiated the investigation under foreign 
intelligence and counterintelligence guidelines designed to 
protect the united states against crimes such as espionage and 
terrorism in which foreign powers or groups are involved 
these guidelines allow the fbi to focus more on politically 
oriented groups and their missions than on specific crimes that are 
planned or carried out because of this wider latitude some 
lawmakers and the american civil liberties union warn that it is 
easy to cross the line and investigate free speech and peaceful 
assembly 
fbi director william s sessions said the investigation in this 
case was predicated on information received from several sources 
that certain leaders and key members of cispes were involved in 
covertly furnishing funds and materials to a foreign terrorist 
organization the group was identified as the fmln the group 
fighting a war against the usbacked government of el salvador 
jerry berman chief legislative counsel for the american civil 
liberties union said the investigation should have started under 
the most strict guidelines those for general criminal 
investigations 
these investigations can only begin when facts or 
circumstances reasonably indicate that a federal crime has been is 
being or will be committed if the crime has already been 
committed the probe focuses on who committed the act and on 
securing evidence 
the fbi is given greater leeway for a domestic intelligence 
investigation which can focus on groups in the united states 
trying to further political or social goals through activities 
that involve criminal violence 
the bureau did not place the cispes investigation under either 
the intelligence or general guidelines but under the foreign 
intelligence and counterintelligence rules that involve 
participation by foreign entities 
these rules remain largely classified but officials familiar 
with them say they provide the widest latitude among the different 
sets of guidelines 
on july 26 1984 some 16 months after the investigation began 
fbi headquarters sent 32 field offices a message that suggested 
some of them were going beyond the guidelines 
some offices have reported information recently regarding 
political statements and political lobbying by cispes or cispes 
affiliates it said supervisors in recipient offices must 
carefully monitor this and related investigations and asset 
operations within your respective divisions to ensure appropriate 
direction targeting and reporting 
but messages from the field showed that bureaus were still 
confused 
in august 1984 the denver office told headquarters the field 
is still not sure of how much seemingly legitimate political 
activity can be monitored

marijuana and small traces of cocaine and 
methamphetamine were detected in the system of an amtrak switchman 
who fled his post after a washingtontoboston train derailment 
officials said tuesday 
thomas connor 30 of aldan pa tested positive for marijuana 
in his blood and urine the federal railroad administration said 
after receiving results from the center for human toxicology at the 
university of utah 
in addition there was evidence of cocaine and methamphetamine 
in connors urine but the levels were so low that the fra declined 
to even say they represented a positive finding under normal 
circumstances 
connor who has since resigned was on duty in a control tower 
when the train struck a work vehicle in chester pa near 
philadelphia injuring 25 people on the train officials said he 
left his post after realizing he had failed to take the train off a 
stretch of track undergoing maintenance 
connor did not submit to blood or urine tests until more than 72 
hours after the accident for that reason the fra said it 
instructed the laboratory to test the specimens to seek the 
smallest detectable amount even if it fell below the normal 
reporting range 
fra administrator john riley said the case illustrated the 
importance of urine and blood tests being conducted on members of 
train crews involved in major accidents that program was struck 
down two weeks ago by the 9th us circuit court of appeals and 
the reagan administration is appealing 
under the provisions of the recent 9th circuit decision it 
is unlikely that we could have performed these tests neither we 
nor the national transportation safety board would have the benefit 
of the information the tests were able to provide riley said 
arthur donato connors attorney was said to be in a meeting 
and unavailable for comment tuesday 
marijuana can remain in the system and be detected for as long 
as 30 days after use cocaine and amphetamines have much shorter 
detection ranges roughly two to five days and two to seven days 
respectively 
the tests found connor had 89 nanograms per mililiter of 
marijuana in his urine a nanogram is one billionth of a gram it 
normally takes a finding of at least 20 nanograms per mililiter to 
confirm the presence of the drug 
fra spokesman bill loftus declined to interpret the findings 
but said they will be considered in investigations of the accident 
by his agency and the ntsb 
this does not determine what level may have been in his system 
at the time of the accident it does not determine impairment it 
does not determine cause loftus said 
an assistant conductor on the amtrak train also tested positive 
for marijuana but he was not believed to have had played any role 
in the accident the fra said

the national governors association voted 
after a spirited debate today to support the uscanada free trade 
agreement despite fears that some state industries could suffer 
the vote was 30 to 5 with the governors of kentucky michigan 
north dakota west virginia and wyoming in the minority 
the governors also adopted policies urging the federal 
government to take action on child care including a modest 
commitment of funds to help poor working families 
the fight against the resolution supporting the free trade 
agreement was led by wyoming gov michael sullivan who charged 
that american energy producers fisheries precious metal miners 
and others are left at a disadvantage 
we can express our support for free trade without endorsing 
the agreement sullivan said he said it was premature and 
governors should wait until their next meeting in august to take a 
stand 
but wisconsin gov tommy thompson replied i dont like the 
beer you dont like the energy governor sullivan but how are we 
going to have some input in the senate ratification debate 
an aide to the wisconsin governor explained that some american 
brewers have licensees in canada but wisconsins heilemanns does 
not and could be left at a disadvantage 
but thompson said it would be a terrible mistake to spurn 
the agreement 
illinois gov james r thompson said that if the governors did 
not put aside partisanship and parochial fears for the greater 
good of the country on this issue then i have to say my voice 
would be a little softer when he asked congress to lay aside 
politics in dealing with the deficit or welfare reform 
the governors who were concluding their threeday winter 
meeting did add an amendment to their resolution offered by gov 
garrey e carruthers of new mexico which said the governors have 
significant concerns about issues created or not fully resolved by 
the agreement and ask to be consulted as the implementing 
legislation or other measures are developed to ameliorate these 
problems the administration should enter into additional 
negotiations to address inequities regarding subsidies 
the governors adopted a policy two years ago supporting the 
uscanada free trade negotiations the new policy says the 
governors support is contingent upon canada and the us doing 
nothing before the final treaty ratification to jeopardize or 
undermine the spirit and benefits of the free trade agreement 
the governor of guam joseph ada expressed concern that us 
territories were left out of the initial agreement 
the governors of hawaii and maine abstained from the vote which 
did not include all the state leaders because of their concerns 
about the agreement which was signed by president reagan and 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney on jan 2 the agreement 
which must be ratified by congress and the canadian parliament 
would eliminate all tariffs between the two countries by 1999 it 
also would set up a new tribunal to settle future trade disputes 
fortyfour governors signed a letter urging the senate to pass a 
welfare reform bill this year and the governors also asked congress 
to extend through 1992 their right to issue mortgage revenue bonds 
a provision in the 1986 tax reform law forbids their issuing new 
mortgage revenue bonds after 1988 
on monday the governors went to the white house to hear 
president reagan make a pitch for a nofrills 11 billion 
republican alternative to the 43 billion housepassed version of 
welfare reform he also cautioned them to tread carefully on 
the issue of child care 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis a democratic presidential 
hopeful called reagans speech a disappointment he said the 
president should have joined the governors call for passage of new 
york sen daniel patrick moynihans welfare reform bill in the 
senate 
reagan instead said he still strongly supports the less costly 
republican alternative that the house rejected two months ago 
which would give states more flexibility in running their welfare 
programs unlike the democratic bill passed by the house it would 
not provide any big increase in aid to families with dependent 
children 
the governors policy on child care calls for the public and 
private sectors to work in concert on the problem and says that 
despite the deficit the governors believe that the federal 
government should begin to take action to improve child care

disabled americans express greater interest in 
politics than other citizens but they register and vote at a rate 
considerably lower than the general public says a survey released 
tuesday 
our findings suggest that barriers either external or 
internal or both prevent many disabled americans from converting 
their exceptionally high political interest into actual electoral 
activity said humphrey taylor president of louis harris and 
associates which conducted the poll 
the telephone poll of 536 disabled people nationwide found that 
53 percent said they follow government and public affairs most of 
the time 
in comparison only 26 percent of all us adults pay attention 
to politics much of the time according to a 1984 national election 
study by the university of michigan 
during the 1984 presidential campaign 46 percent of the 
disabled americans were very much interested in the contest 
compared with 35 percent of all adults according to the new 
survey conducted in june and july 1987 by louis harris and 
associates 
however the interest did not translate into equal levels of 
registration and voting 
disabled people registered at a rate that is six points lower 
than the general population and voted at a rate that 12 points 
lower the poll said 
the most common barrier cited for disabled people was lack of 
transportation and difficulty in getting to the polls problems 
noted by 29 percent of the respondents twentyone percent said it 
was difficult to stand or walk 
the survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent 
taylor said he expects the number of disabled voters to increase 
as states comply with federal law to make areas accessible to the 
nations approximately 35 million disabled 
the survey defined disabled as people with a health problem that 
prevented them from working attending school or participating in 
other activities people with a physical disability such as 
blindness or people who considered themselves disabled 
the announcement of the survey results coincided with the start 
of the national organization on disabilitys public service 
campaign to encourage the disabled to register to vote 
the campaign included magazine ads featuring photos of former 
texas rep barbara jordan and presidential press secretary james 
brady and the words were here promoting voter registration for 
the 1988 elections 
the ad also carries a tollfree number for registration 
information 1800248able 
oneminute television spots also promote the hotline number

leaders of austrias three main political 
parties called tuesday for a reconsideration of plans to have 
president kurt waldheim address a ceremony on the 50th anniversary 
of austrias annexation by nazi germany 
the debate over the solemn ceremony march 11 is the latest round 
in the international controversy surrounding waldheim and his role 
in the german army under adolf hitler 
several highranking politicians have suggested the event should 
be called off saying a waldheim speech is not the way for the 
country to reflect on the atrocities of the nazi era 
none of the officials tuesday called for a cancellation and none 
said that waldheim should be barred from speaking still it was 
clear that the politicians were not satisfied with the structure of 
the ceremony as it stands 
waldheim has consistently denied that he committed wrongdoing as 
a first lieutenant serving in the german army in the balkans in 
world war ii 
an international historians commission report released earlier 
this month left open the question of whether waldheim committed 
nazi wartime atrocities 
however the report said waldheim was in close proximity to 
nazi atrocities in the balkans knew they were going on and made no 
attempt ot stop them it also said waldheim concealed his wartime 
past 
the commission which started work in 1987 was formed after the 
us government placed waldheim on a watch list of undesirable 
aliens effectively barring him from the united states 
at a joint news conference tuesday the parliamentary leaders of 
the conservative peoples party the socialists and the 
rightistoriented freedom party said organizers should rethink 
plans for the cermony which include a waldheim speech 
parliament president leopold gratz a socialist said it is not 
a question of canceling the ceremony but he emphasized a meeting 
of the organizers is needed because high officials have gone 
public with their questioning of the sense of the planned official 
ceremony 
several thousand protesters are expected to gather outside the 
hofburg palace where the ceremony is set to take place to 
demonstrate against waldheim and demand his resignation 
protesters many of them opposed to waldheim also have promised 
to flood heroes square next to the hofburg on march 12 the day 
after the scheduled waldheim speech 
gerulf stix parliamentary leader of the freedom party also 
called tuesday for a rethinking of the commemoration plans while 
the tiny greens party has called for its scrapping altogether 
several other political leaders also have expressed their 
reservations 
i have misgivings about this event socialist party chief 
fred sinowatz told reporters at a news conference monday 
the former chancellor called instead for reflection of what 
happened on march 11 1938 and what must be done so that such a 
thing never happens again 
german troops marched into austria nearly 50 years ago 
officially linking this alpine nation with hitlers third reich 
austrians are marking the annexation called the anschluss in 
german as a time of reflection on the troubled past 
austrian television and radio along with many of the countrys 
newspapers have started programs leading up to the march 11 
commemoration date there also are films and exhibitions

doctors dentists and other healthcare workers 
can face penalties under the citys civil rights laws if they 
refuse to treat people with aids an administrative law judge has 
ruled 
judge william kirchgaessner in a 17page decision handed down 
monday said that the city human rights commissions ban against 
discrimination in public accommodations included healthcare 
services 
the ruling in the case of john campanella who was diagnosed as 
having aids two years ago clears the way for him to file a 
complaint with the commission against his dentist dr david 
hurwitz hurwitz had sent campanella a letter a year ago saying he 
would no longer treat campanella because of the disease 
this ruling puts all healthcare workers in the city 
including dentists doctors and nurses on notice that they cannot 
refuse to treat people with aids said lisa bloom an attorney 
who represented campanella 
arnold weiss hurwitzs attorney had filed a motion to dismiss 
the complaint arguing that the commission did not have the 
authority to call a professional office a place of public 
accommodation 
weiss declined to comment monday on the ruling saying he had 
not yet read it or to say whether it would be appealed 
no date has been set for a hearing on campanellas complaint 
ms bloom said 
aids is caused by a virus that damages the bodys immune system 
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer it is spread 
through sexual contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers 
infected blood or blood products and from pregnant women to their 
offspring

soviet president andrei gromyko was 
welcomed tuesday by his hungarian counterpart karoly nemeth at the 
beginning of a fiveday visit to this reformminded but 
economically stagnant soviet ally 
the only official business on the calendar of the former 
longtime soviet foreign minister who became soviet president three 
years ago was the signing of an agreement establishing a hungarian 
cultural center in moscow 
but a hungarian official said privately that gromyko and 
hungarian leaders could be expected to discuss everything about 
relations between the two countries 
the visit officially was to mark the 40th anniversary of the 
feb 18 1948 mutual assistance pact between the two countries 
and on thursday gromyko is to give a major address to the 
hungarian parliament 
gromyko 78 was accompanied by a large soviet delegation 
including deputy foreign minister vadim loginov and victor karpov 
head of the soviet writers union the soviets are staying until 
saturday morning 
in a brief but ornate welcoming ceremony in the square in front 
of the parliament building situated along the danube gromyko 
inspected an honor guard of troops and listened to a military band 
play the anthems of the two nations 
he and nemeth then departed presumably for private talks 
representatives of the soviet delegation were to meet with 
reporters in the evening 
the government newspaper in a banner headline across its front 
page tuesday said we greet with sincere respect and friendship 
comrade andrei gromyko 
the newspaper magyar hirlap noted that it was gromykos first 
state trip abroad since assuming the presidency of the supreme 
soviet in 1985 after his long career as soviet foreign minister 
the reason he chose hungary the newspaper said may be that 
our own efforts and initiatives are being recognized and that 
soviet bodies are showing a wellmeaning interest in our 
country 
hungary under party chief janos kadar has been a leader of 
economic and political reform among soviet bloc nations and its 
policies in many ways parallel the changes advocated in the soviet 
union by mikhail s gorbachev 
but the economic success of hungary in the 1960s and 70s has 
given way to stagnation in the 1980s 
hungarians are facing doubledigit inflation and a foreign debt 
burden of 16 billion for a country of only 106 million people 
the highest per capita debt in the east bloc 
the economic problems and the question mark hanging over the 
nation as it waits the eventual retirement of kadar who will be 76 
in may are seen as two possible topics that would come up during 
the gromyko visit 
kadar has been general secretary of the hungarian socialist 
workers communist party since 1956

the supreme court in a defeat for private 
landowners on tuesday buttressed the power of states to control 
inland and coastal property affected by shifting tides 
in a 53 ruling involving mississippis claim to 42 acres of 
underwater land the justices hotly disputed the effect of the 
decision 
the dissenters said it threatens private property in every 
coastal state in the nation 
but justice byron r white writing for the majority said we 
are doubtful that this ruling will do more than confirm the 
prevailing understanding our ruling today will not upset titles in 
all coastal states 
the ruling involving oil and gasrich land near mississippis 
gulf coast said states own land beneath waters subject to the 
tides influence and not only land under navigable waters 
the ebb and flow of the tide not navigability determines the 
states ownership as long as it previously has not relinquished a 
public trust claim to the tidelands white said 
states have interests in lands beneath tidal waters which have 
nothing to do with navigation he said those purposes range from 
protecting fishing to setting aside submerged land for reclamation 
for urban expansion he said 
it would be odd to acknowledge such diverse uses of public 
trust tidelands and then suggest that the sole measure of the 
expanse of such lands is the navigability of the waters over 
them white said 
he said tuesdays ruling is in line with longstanding tradition 
giving states control over tidelands 
the court rejected an appeal by private landowners and companies 
that included phillips petroleum and a partnership called cinque 
bambini 
the private interests challenged mississippis claim to some 
2400 acres of undeveloped property in hancock county lower courts 
granted most of the land to the private companies 
but the courts said the state owns 42 acres underlying the north 
branch of bayou lacroix and 11 small drainage systems about five 
miles from the gulf the state leased the land to saga petroleum 
us inc in 1977 for oil and gas exploration 
the mississippi supreme court in 1986 upheld the states 
ownership of the land based on a grant from the federal government 
when mississippi became a state in 1817 
the state court said the states title extends to all land 
subject to tidal influence inland to the mean high water mark 
the mississippi land is influenced by the tide since it is 
affected by the ebb and flow of an adjacent navigable river that 
flows into the gulf 
the private landowners and companies traced their claims to the 
underwater land back to spanish land grants of 1813 
in a dissenting opinion tuesday justice sandra day oconnor 
said the ruling could have sweeping impact 
the court holds today that the public trust includes not only 
tidewaters along the ocean shore but also discrete bodies of water 
that are influenced by the tide but far removed from the ocean or 
any navigable tidal water she said 
breaking a chain of title that reaches back more than 150 
years the court today announces a rule that will disrupt the 
settled expectations of landowners not only in mississippi but in 
every coastal state 
oconnor was joined by justices john paul stevens and antonin 
scalia 
in other decisions the court 
limited the job protection for government workers fired for 
lacking security clearances in a 53 ruling involving a fired 
laborer at a navy installation in washington state the court 
agreed with the reagan administration that the merit systems 
protection board lacks authority to decide whether denials of 
security clearance are justified 
said 62 in a california case that a criminal suspects 
rights are not violated when a witness who is unable to identify 
the suspect in court testifies about an earlier identification of 
the accused 
in a victory for the states of missouri iowa and nebraska 
unanimously limited the authority of the interior secretary to 
allocate water stored in missouri river basin reservoirs 
unanimously ruled in a case from california that businesses may 
not be sued in federal court for refusing to contribute to 
multiemployer union benefit funds after a collective bargaining 
agreement expires 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court last thursday 
did not take part in any of the decisions

a 21yearold white man taught to hate black 
people was sentenced tuesday to perform 200 hours of community 
service for the naacp after he admitted chasing two blacks with a 
baseball bat 
cook county circuit judge stuart nudelman said he hoped that by 
working with blacks james kalafut would overcome his prejudice 
he has been taught to hate black people for some reason 
nudelman said after the sentencing im trying to put him in an 
environment where he can perhaps do some good and learn something 
about the people he thinks he hates and perhaps learn that his 
feelings are misguided 
kalafut was charged aug 16 after he and other whites 
brandishing baseball bats throwing bottles and shouting racial 
slurs chased two blacks from a transit stop in gage park a 
predominantly white neighborhood on chicagos southwest side 
the plumbing company laborer could have been sentenced to a year 
in prison on his plea of guilty to aggravated assault and ethnic 
intimidation the judge said 
kalafuts brother larry is serving a sixyear prison term 
after pleading guilty to firebombing the home of a black family who 
had moved into gage park said barry silver james attorney 
silver said the order for his client to work for national 
association for the advancement of colored people is a good 
sentence given the fxhat hes basically pleaded guilty to 
hating a minority group 
by being with black people he will have a chance to learn 
they are no different than he is except that the color of their 
skin is different i think that is an important lesson for anyone 
to learn especially someone who has been involved in this kind of 
activity silver said 
the attorney said james kalafut who declined to be interviewed 
was willing to give the sentence a try but was concerned about 
his own personal safety when he is in the neighborhood of the 
naacp located on chicagos south side 
he also said kalafut was concerned about being rejected by naacp 
officials and being made the scapegoat in a sort of reverse 
discrimination 
the naacp plans to work hard to make sure that doesnt happen 
said edward mcclellan president of the groups south side branch 
certainly we dont presume there are only white racists or 
what have you mcclellan said racism can be engendered by 
anyone inclined to that sort of prejudice 
he said it wasnt the civilrights groups job to punish 
kalafut he also said he wasnt sure what type of work the group 
would ask him to perform 
i can only hope his attitude is such that hes willing to come 
here and pay his debt to society mcclellan said i would hope 
that he would have some positive reflections from this experience 
that maybe hes been hating the wrong thing 
nudelman said that trying to help kalafut overcome his prejudice 
made more sense than sentencing him to jail where he wont learn 
anything except more hatred 
but the judge warned if he screws up and doesnt do what hes 
supposed to hell come back before me and ill sentence him to 
jail

court over the brutality massoud says was inflicted on him it is 
the second time this month palestinians have reported being buried 
alive by soldiers 
the israeli army says it is investigating both incidents 
they took me to the beach about a mile and a half away 
massoud said they attached me to a jeep and dragged me behind it 
through the sand and the water 
massoud said he saw another youth on the beach whom he 
identified as saleh hamad receiving the same treatement 
they put sand in my mouth and covered me with sand then they 
covered me up using their hands he said 
the youth said he did not know how deeply he was buried but the 
weight on his chest was very heavy and he lost consciousness 
the next thing i remember i was in the hospital he said 
lying under a blanket on a mattress spread on the floor of his 
spare home in the khan yunis refugee camp the young palestinian 
recounted how israeli soldiers burst into his home at 4 am feb 
14 
they used ladders to climb over the wall into the tiny 
courtyard in front of the house massoud said 
as family members and neighbors began to gather in the small 
room he said i was sleeping here like this i suddenly saw 
soldiers they shined a strong light in my face they started to 
beat me with sticks 
the youth said the soldiers put a chain around his neck to raise 
him to his feet beat him to the ground and used the chain to raise 
him again

houses in the neighborhood a maze of winding narrow alleys they 
were looking for teenaged boys she said but her son adel was the 
only one in the area 
after the soldiers took adel to the beach buried him in the 
sand and left families living near the beach rescued him

secretary of state george p shultz 
said tuesday the soviet union has made a very clear commitment 
to withdraw its troops from afghanistan even though no firm 
timetable has been announced 
us sources said the red army had begun preparations to leave 
soviet soldiers were sent to afghanistan in december 1979 and an 
estimated 115000 are in the country helping the communist 
government fight moslem insurgents 
north atlantic treaty organization officials who attended a 
closed meeting with shultz described him as hopeful of a soviet 
withdrawal but said he did not mention specific evidence that 
preparations were under way 
shultz told reporters when asked why he was optimistic about 
soviet intentions their statements are very clear and very 
public and unequivocal unadorned 
a senior us official briefing reporters on condition of 
anonymity said soviet troops are taking up defensive positions and 
dependents are being sent home he said this was solid evidence 
that the soviet military intervention would end soon 
the official also said soviet soldiers are not being replaced 
when they finish tours of duty he spoke on shultzs flight to 
brussels from two days of talks in moscow 
while shultz was in brussels the kremlins warsaw pact 
colleagues were briefed on the moscow talks by eduard a 
shevardnadze the soviet foreign minister 
after a 2hour meeting with the nato allies shultz flew to 
washington to prepare for a trip wednesday to the middle east 
where he will meet with arab and israeli leaders about efforts to 
revive peace negotiations 
in his remarks to reporters shultz said he had encountered 
intense skepticism about the chances of a breakthrough on 
middle east negotiations but the united states has a few ideas 
that could help end the deadlock he was not more specific 
i believe that if there are chances even if the chances are 
small its worthwhile trying he said you cant be too afraid 
of failing 
europeans who attended the nato meeting said the allies praised 
shultz and the reagan administration for making an effort on middle 
east peace 
there was the feeling expressed that of course the situation 
appears deadlocked but that nonetheless it would be worth trying 
now one said on condition that his name not be given 
shultz said a complete soviet withdrawal from afghanistan would 
boost prospects for resolving other regional issues 
i certainly have the sense that they do regard their 
presence in afghanistan as counterproductive at this point and they 
would like to leave he said 
on feb 8 soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev offered to begin 
the withdrawal may 15 if pakistan and afghanistan reach agreement 
by march 15 in unsponsored negotiations that resume in geneva 
next week he said the pullout could be accomplished in 10 months 
kremlin officials have accused pakistan of obstructing a 
settlement by insisting an interim government be created in kabul 
to prevent protracted civil strife about 35 million afghan 
refugees have fled to neighboring pakistan which is eager for a 
solution 
shultz told the nato allies the soviets decided to withdraw 
because they realized they could not defeat the guerrillas who get 
much of their support from the united states 
the secretary also reported progress on arms control in his 
moscow talks with gorbachev and shevardnadze 
on monday us and soviet negotiators were directed to prepare 
within a month three draft agreements for a treaty to reduce 
longrange or strategic nuclear weapons by 30 percent to 50 
percent 
draft accords on verification disposing of weapons and exchange 
of information are to be ready for the next shultzshevardnadze 
meeting march 2223 in washington the goal is for gorbachev and 
president reagan to sign the final treaty at a summit in moscow 
late this spring

cities may not promote equal opportunity by 
imposing blanket restrictions that force private clubs to admit 
women and racial minorities as members the supreme court was told 
tuesday 
alan mansfield a lawyer for the new york state clubs 
association said such a new york city law violates the 
fundamental right of our citizens to choose who their friends 
will be 
but peter l zimroth the citys chief lawyer said the clubs 
affected by the law are not intimate associations but bastions of 
the oldboy network where business deals are consummated 
citing the example of the 10003member new york athletic club 
zimroth asked the justices can you imagine someone saying here 
are 10002 of my most intimate friends 
the court seemed to be confused by the widely varying views 
expressed by mansfield and zimroth about the law and a ruling by 
new yorks highest state court upholding it 
the justices decision expected by july could carry an impact 
well beyond new yorks borders at least five other major cities 
buffalo chicago detroit los angeles and san francisco have 
enacted similar ordinances recently 
the new york city law banning discrimination by public 
accommodations exempts distinctly private organizations 
but it deprives nonreligious groups of that designation if they 
have more than 400 members provide regular meal service and 
regularly get their members dues paid by nonmembers such as the 
members employers 
mansfield said the city law wrongly treats any organization that 
meets the three criteria as nonprivate three prongs and youre 
out he said this law incorporates a fundamentally incorrect 
analysis of the freedom to associate 
mansfield said each club affected by the law should have a 
chance to prove that even if it meets each of the three criteria 
it is a truly private entity 
zimroth said no such club has come forward i dont think this 
is a real case he said the city council wasnt talking about 
hypothetical clubs it was talking about real clubs 
both lawyers were interrupted repeatedly by questions from the 
bench during the 60minute argument session 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court last thursday 
and only recently resigned from a menonly whitesonly club in san 
francisco appeared troubled by the fact that the law also exempts 
certain benevolent orders such as the masons loyal order of 
moose protective order of elks and the knights of columbus 
mansfield argued that treating various private organizations 
differently violates equalprotection guarantees 
zimroth said new york city officials were not concerned about 
such organizations being used as extensions of the business office 
justice harry a blackmun who recently resigned from a menonly 
club in the nations capital did not ask a question 
one of the more animated exchanges occurred when justice 
thurgood marshall suggested that the challenged law was a valid 
civil rights measure and then said to mansfield you want to 
torpedo it

the un command rejected north korean 
charges tuesday it is building up forces for a nuclear attack and 
it demanded the communist nation admit it ordered the bombing of a 
civilian airliner 
the united nations command dismissed a north korean demand that 
the united states and south korea call off joint military 
exercises called team spirit it accused north korea of 
fomenting tension on the divided korean peninsula and trying to 
sabotage the 1988 olympic games in seoul 
the united states maintains 40000 troops in south korea and 
heads the command which represents the 16 nations that fought 
under un auspices against north korea and china during the korean 
war 
dont miscalculate the will of the world to react with 
appropriate action to continued barbaric acts of terrorism which 
result in the deaths of innocent people said us rear adm 
william t pendley the chief un command delegate 
pendley demanded north korea punish those involved in the 
bombing last november of a south korean airliner and apologize to 
the world all 115 people aboard the korean air jet were killed 
when it blew up nov 29 over the andaman sea near burma 
chief north korean delegate maj gen li tae ho said pyongyang 
had nothing to do with the attack and charged south korea with 
destroying the plane in a scheme to retain power and discredit the 
north 
the charges were made at the first meeting of the military 
armistice commission since the loss of the plane the commission 
polices the ceasefire that ended the korean war between north and 
south in 1953 
north korea called the meeting to demand the united states and 
south korea abandon the annual team spirit exercises that start 
next month charging the exercises were preparations for an 
american nuclear attack 
you have nuclear war plans worked out li charged 
pendley dismissed the north korean accusations and said the 
exercises were lawful military activities intended to guarantee the 
safety of south korea 
the un commands delegation presented a videotape of a 
televised confession last month in seoul by kim hyon hui a woman 
who claimed she was a north korean agent and destroyed the plane to 
disrupt the olympic games that start in seoul in september 
ms kim who rode an early leg of the kal flight took poison 
along with a male companion when they were detained in bahrain the 
man died but she recovered 
pendley said the confession was damning evidence that the north 
could not refute you thought you had committed the perfect 
crime but like all criminals you made a mistake he said 
north korea has been demanding to be a cohost of the olympic 
games the international olympic committee and south korea have 
rejected the demand

while hundreds of university of 
massachusetts students discussed racism in class a small group at 
neighboring hampshire college on tuesday occupied a dormitory 
office to protest racial attitudes at that elite school 
the takeover came nearly a week after the end of a sixday 
occupation of a university of massachusetts building by more than 
100 people protesting racial violence on campus 
that occupation ended when protesters reached an agreement with 
the chancellor joseph duffey which included increased hiring of 
minority faculty and staff 
penny premdas a spokeswoman for the hampshire group students 
of underrepresented cultures said up to 40 students occupied the 
office of the dakin house dormitory a traditional meeting place 
for minority students at 8 am to work on a list of demands 
including that an office in the dormitory be converted into a third 
world cultural center 
we have been to the administration several times over the past 
three years with our demands and concerns and nothing has been 
done said ms premdas who is black its been all lip 
service it seemed this was the only way to get something done 
unlike the university of massachusetts which has been the scene 
of attacks on blacks we have never had any blatant physical 
harassment here ms premdas said it has all been emotional 
and mental and institutional 
a dakin house resident marston chickering said the occupation 
was particularly hard at this school which has an image of being 
politically correct and aware 
no ones ever satisfied at this school said karen bagninm 
a freshman from new york city who lives across the yard from dakin 
everyones always feeling belittled or discriminated against if 
its not minorities its females this is what they the 
protesters feel they have to do to get attention 
about 100 of the 1100 undergraduate students at the private 
college are minorities said petez gluckler a spokesman for the 
administration 
a consultant hired by the school last year to investigate racial 
attitudes on campus is preparing his final report gluckler said 
the school planned to provide the protesters with food and 
sleeping bags said hampshire spokeswoman lee wicks 
hundreds of students at the 25000student university of 
massachusetts campus across town from hampshire attended class 
discussions on racism on tuesday 
at least 35 classes were devoted to the topic in response to a 
call by the graduate student association to boycott all classes 
tuesday and wednesday in lieu of forums on racism said school 
spokeswoman jeanne hopkins 
duffey had warned in a statement against students boycotting 
classes and had suggested that racism discussions be held in 
classes

peoples court judge joseph wapners word 
is the law on television but not necessarily off camera where the 
popular shows lawyers have agreed to pay a 2500 settlement to a 
man the judge ruled against 
the shows producers said the 2500 awarded to 72yearold 
former mr america rex ravelle marked the first time the judge has 
settled out of court with someone who has sued over a tv decision 
the judges decision was so bad it was unbelievable said 
ravelle who had sought 2000 in back rent and return of a bedroom 
set he said was taken by a woman he evicted from his house 
ravelle said in a recent interview that he was set up to look 
like a bully and a buffoon and then wapner ruled against him for 
dramatic effect when the show was taped dec 4 1985 
i was instructed to project my voice and assert myself while 
the defendant was submissive and scarcely audible ravelle said 
this obvious ploy clearly established me as the big macho 
villain 
wapner said he couldnt recall ravelles case and was unaware of 
the settlement but added he tries to be fair to all people on the 
show 
i try to be fair and our track record is there said 
wapner former presiding judge of los angeles superior court i 
try to make sure that each side gets a fair shot 
ravelle who had sued the show for 1 million agreed to drop 
the suit in exchange for the settlement last week 
of approximately 2000 small claims cases wapner has heard 
during the shows seven years ravelle is one of only three 
disgruntled litigants to sue said james b pollock vice president 
for ralph edwards productions the shows producer he is the only 
one to win a settlement pollock added

who file for damages in small claims courts in 36 southern 
california localities since files are open to the public 
researchers can read cases and get in touch with those filing 
claims those selected after phone interviews appear for personal 
interviews and are selected by producers for the program

the executive staff of the us bureau 
of prisons has decided federal inmates should not have the 
privilege of begetting children through artificial insemination 
if such a police were allowed the government believes that 
numerous other inmates from regular prison institutions of all 
security levels would desire to beget children according to the 
governments response filed monday in the case of a federal 
prisoner 
the response was filed monday in the case of steven james 
goodwin 31 a prisoner in the medical center for federal prisoners 
in springfield 
goodwin had filed a lawsuit against the government and received 
a favorable ruling from us magistrate james england the judge 
recommended in november that us district judge william r 
collison rule that the bureaus lack of a policy on artificial 
insemination isnt a constitutionally sufficient reason to prohibit 
the procedure 
goodwin had asked in his lawsuit that doctors be allowed to 
collect his sperm at the prison so it could be frozen and sent to 
his wifes doctor in st louis 
the executive staff of the bureau met earlier this month to 
consider a policy on the issue assistant us attorney david c 
jones said in the governments response 
if the procedure were allowed in one case all 48 federal 
prisons would be affected the prisons either would have to develop 
collecting handling and storage procedures for semen or private 
medical personnel would have to be allowed into the institutions 
jones said 
as result the response said the bureau believes the situation 
could be extremely costly or create substantial security risks 
the government disagreed with englands ruling that begetting or 
bearing children is a fundamental right that survives 
incarceration actually begetting or bearing children is one of

eightyseven firefighters who had been 
on duty for more than three days were sent home tuesday as 
colleagues ended a sickout and returned to work under threats of 
contempt of court citations 
more than 100 firefighters called in sick saturday sunday and 
monday despite a judges order saturday that they report for duty 
thirtythree firefighters who defied the order were held in 
contempt tuesday by another judge americo campanella of superior 
court for failure to show up in court to explain why they were 
absent 
the firefighters had been served notice by the city to appear in 
court on monday 
campanellas ruling stunned attorneys for local 799 of the 
international association of firefighters they told campanella it 
was their impression he only wanted union president leo j miller 
and secretarytreasurer richard kless in court 
attorney harry j hoopis said he thought his representation of 
the union membership as a whole as well as millers was good 
enough to constitute the presence of the absent members 
campanella who continued the hearing on the status of the rest 
of the firefighters who called in sick said he would decide later 
what penalty to assess against the 33 
mayor joseph r paolino urged that no jail time be imposed 
however the city continued to press for contempt citations even 
though the sickout ended with the start of tuesdays day shift to 
prevent something similar from happening in the future according 
to city labor attorney vincent ragosta jr 
the sickout which the city is trying to prove is an illegal job 
action by municipal employees cost the city about 84000 in 
overtime and related expenses estimated fire chief michael f 
moise 
it also meant a long haul for firefighters who went to work at 6 
pm friday moise kept them on duty through the sickout but they 
went home tuesday 
the sickout apparently stemmed from a dispute over language in a 
contract ratified by firefighters in december but yet to be 
approved by the city council 
miller contends the city is trying to renege on a provision that 
calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit 
union members also say the city is not replacing wornout or 
damaged equipment as promised

thenfbi director william webster was kept 
unaware of problems with a probe of antireagan activists even 
when it became clear that some agents were investigating legitimate 
protest activities a top agency official said tuesday 
oliver b revell executive assistant fbi director also told 
the senate intelligence committee that no one in the administration 
told the bureau to conduct the investigation 
revells testimony offered the first indepth look at the fbis 
investigations of the committee in solidarity with the people of el 
salvador or cispes which began in 1981 and ended in 1985 leaders 
of cispes maintain that the inquiries were politically motivated 
but revell denied that charge 
nothing could be further from the truth he said we have 
investigated a number of groups on the other side of the political 
spectrum 
the focus of the fbi investigations has been and is 
criminality or the collection of intelligence which will keep our 
nation and citizens safe from terrorism he said 
at another point revell said i have no knowledge of any 
political taskings by anyone in the reagan administration of the 
fbis cispes investigation 
no criminal charges ever have been filed against cispes or any 
of its members 
several members of the committee told revell they remained 
skeptical of the fbi information that triggered the investigation 
of cispes 
sen arlen specter rpa said he had grave questions about 
revells justifications adding you have to proceed on the basis 
of tangible hard facts and evidence which he indicated were 
lacking in this case 
but revell noted that it was a terrorism investigation and 
added that if the fbi always waited until there was tangible 
evidence you would have been picking up the pieces of the bombs 
earlier specter asked revell the extent of websters 
involvement in the cispes probe 
he was aware of several cables sent to him for informational 
purposes revell said he did not authorize any of the 
activities the supervision was at the sectional level 
revell added that it is impossible for the fbi director to keep 
up with all the investigations the bureau conducts however he did 
say that in the wake of revelations about the conduct of the cispes 
case we have taken interim steps to increase the level of 
review of sensitive probes 
webster who now directs the cia has had no public comment on 
the investigation 
sen william cohen rmaine vice chairman of the intelligence 
panel joined specter in criticizing the fbi probe 
it is apparent that whatever the rationale for its initiation 
it resulted in the fbi subjecting many americans and us 
organizations to various types of scrutiny without any basis other 
than the exercise of their first amendment rights cohen said 
he later asked revell why the fbi headquarters had to send a 
memo on july 26 1984 cautioning the field offices against 
reporting legitimate political activities by cispes 
revell replied that the memo was sent because top fbi officials 
sensed the conduct of some agents was very close to the 
line 
we may have seen some wavering over that line he said but 
he maintained that the investigation was legitimate under the fbis 
foreign intelligence and counterintelligence guidelines 
revell said the fbi opened its investigation into cispes on 
sept 3 1981 after the justice department requested the bureau 
examine whether the group was supplying money and material to 
leftist rebels in el salvador and therefore was required to 
register under the foreign agents registration act 
revell described that probe as just a records check and it 
was closed in february 1982 
a little more than a year later on march 30 1983 the 
counterterrorism section at the fbi authorized a new investigation 
of cispes this probe revell said was into whether members of 
cispes were engaged in international terrorism activities in 
preparation therefor or knowingly aiding and abetting the 
terrorists in el salvador and other countries in the conduct of 
international terrorist activities 
that investigation continued for more than two years during 
which time revell said we did find indications that some cispes 
members were at least discussing and planning violence 
he cited an instance of a cispes member given the job of 
determining response times of emergency services in a major 
american city another of a cispes member saying he had developed a 
system to shut down a public utility in a major midwestern city and 
a third of discussion of plans to disrupt the 1984 republican 
convention in dallas 
angela sanbrano executive director of cispes who attended the 
intelligence committee hearing denied afterward that any of the 
charges were true she suggested that the comments about possible 
violent activities might have been made by someone planted at 
cispes meetings 
revell said the fbi closed the investigation in june 1985 when 
we found there was insufficient evidence to continue the 
investigation 
he said part of the reason for that was the disinformation and 
misinformation supplied to us by frank varelli who told a house 
subcommittee last year hat he was paid by the fbi to infiltrate the 
dallas chapter of cispes and told the bureau what it wanted to hear 
revell said earlier that the dallas fbi agent who directed 
varelli was investigated for mishandling documents funds and 
direction 
varelli has sued the fbi in an attempt to get pay he claims he 
is owed for his work

orders to us factories for big ticket 
durable goods fell 28 percent in january the biggest decline in a 
year reflecting sharp drops in demand for aircraft and primary 
metals the government reported tuesday 
the commerce department said that orders for durable goods fell 
to a seasonally adjusted 11223 billion last month a drop of 
328 billion from december 
the steep decline only the third setback in the past 13 months 
followed a big december advance of 41 percent the strongest rise 
since march 
analysts said the january setback reflected a return to more 
normal levels of demand in both aircraft and primary metals two 
categories which had seen unusually big advances in december 
both the reagan administration and federal reserve chairman alan 
greenspan noted that the overall decline also masked pockets of 
strength particularly in nondefense capital goods 
the numbers that were released on durable goods if one 
subtracts some of the temporary fluctuations were really quite 
strong greenspan said during an appearance before a house 
banking subcommittee 
many economists are predicting that growth will slow in the 
first half of 1988 because of an unusually high buildup of unsold 
inventories which occurred at the end of 1987 but greenspan said 
he did not think this slowdown would deteriorate into a recession 
in part because of the strength being shown in manufacturing 
while we envisage sluggish growth for the period immediately 
ahead there just are very few signs that were about to tilt 
over into a recession greenspan said 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
that the administration continues to believe that the trend in 
manufacturing is still healthy 
the administration is forecasting that half of overall growth 
this year will come from rising factory production 
private economists said they were not alarmed by the january 
setback which was the biggest drop since an 8 percent fall in 
january 1987 they pointed to a 16 percent increase in orders for 
nondefense capital goods the category which reflects business 
plans to expand production facilities 
that is an encouraging sign that businessmen are not backing 
off from their investment plans said david wyss an economist 
with data resources inc of lexington mass 
even with the setback last month new orders were still 155 
percent ahead of a year ago reflecting the strong export demand 
caused by the decline in the value of the dollar 
demand in transportation industries fell by 124 percent to 
2721 billion last month following an 86 percent advance in 
december a surge which was attributed primarily to new aircraft 
orders placed with the boeing co of seattle 
orders for primary metals fell 155 percent to 1019 billion 
after having shot up 105 percent in december analysts said that 
the big december jump in orders came because of fears of pending 
price increases 
demand for military hardware fell 121 percent in january to 
786 billion 
orders for electrical machinery rose 55 percent in january 
while demand for nonelectrical machinery rose 58 percent 
shipments of durable goods fell 33 percent to 10926 billion 
following a 43 percent increase in december

a british soldier sentenced to 
life in prison for slaying a belfast catholic has been released 
from jail and returned to his regiment after only three years in 
prison the army said tuesday 
pvt ian richard thain was not however returned to active 
service in northern ireland 
an army statement tuesday said thain killed the man when he was 
18 
while the army in no way condones his action we consider the 
incident to have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young 
man in very difficult circumstances the statement said 
the rev denis faul a roman catholic priest and human rights 
campaigner in northern ireland said he had no objection to the 
release but asked why similar clemency could not be shown to 
civilians serving life sentences for actions committed in their 
youth 
sinn fein the legal political wing of the outlawed irish 
republican army claimed thains release showed there was no 
justice in northern ireland 
im very very shocked and distressed i cant believe this 
has happened said the victims father jim reilly 
the announcement of thains release came amid new tension 
between britain and ireland 
on sunday a catholic was killed by a british soldier in 
northern ireland the irish government announced it would undertake 
its own investigation of the slaying even though the incident 
occurred in northern ireland outside dublins jurisdiction 
the irish move was seen as a calculated slight to britain since 
its police force has already announced its own inquiry and the 
soldier has been placed in military custody 
sundays shooting of 23yearold aidan mcanespie occurred near 
aughnacloy half a mile from the frontier in county tyrone 
mcanespie was killed by a bullet from an army observation tower 
at a checkpoint as he walked to a football match 
mcanespie was a sinn fein supporter and his former parish 
priest said he was harassed whenever he passed through the 
checkpoint press association the british news agency said the 
soldier who fired at mcanespie told his interrogators it was an 
accident 
thain was convicted of killing thomas reilly road manager of 
the pop group bananarama on aug 9 1983 he claimed in court that 
he fired because he believed reilly was about to pull a gun on him 
the judge found thain deliberately untruthful the private 
was the first soldier sentenced to life imprisonment for actions in 
northern ireland 
thain was released on a life license a form of parole whereby 
he can be reimprisoned should his behavior give rise to 
concern the home office said 
it said he was freed after a review by the state parole board 
angloirish relations are already under strain on a series of 
issues including disputes over the extradition of ira suspects and 
british antiterrorism laws which dublin sees as discriminatory 
toward ulster catholics 
the worst tension however is being generated by britains 
announcement last month that it will not prosecute northern ireland 
police officers involved in the shooting of six unarmed catholics 
in three incidents in 1982 despite evidence of a police conspiracy 
to pervert the course of justice

a memo to attorney general edwin meese iii 
from his friend e robert wallach broached a proposal to bolster 
israels moderate labor party against the rival likud bloc 
in his september 1985 memo made public monday wallach stressed 
the need to encourage soviet leaders to allow greater jewish 
emigration to israel because russian jews once they are voters in 
israel tend to support the labor party 
israel contends that 400000 jews want to emigrate from the 
soviet union enough to make a difference in an israeli election 
if all were allowed to resettle in israel 
wallachs idea was based on the assumption that israel would 
call early elections no later than march 1986 but it is unclear 
whether an influx of russian jews could have brought about a labor 
victory no election was held and in october 1986 thenprime 
minister shimon peres switched jobs with foreign minister yitzhak 
shamir in a powersharing arrangement 
there is a need to provide israel with a increasing flow of 
ashkenazi jews to help balance the influx of sephardicoriental 
jews who have a natural affinity and affiliation with likud 
wallach wrote 
from the standpoint of american interests the advantage is 
evident he added without elaboration 
ashkenazi jews are those whose origins are in europe while 
sephardic jews came from asia and africa voter breakdown shows 
that sephardim who constitute some 60 percent of israels 35 
million jewish population tend to support likud more than they do 
labor 
us leaders in the past have said privately they feel more 
comfortable with labor which exhibits greater willingness to cede 
lands to israels arab neighbors in return for a peace settlement 
likud is more hardline refusing any territorial concessions 
but publicly the united states has consistently veered away 
from taking any stand that could be viewed as interference in 
internal israeli politics 
the wallachmeese memo is the focal point of a criminal 
investigation of the attorney general at issue is whether meese 
knew from reading the memo of a plan to pay a bribe to the labor 
party and if so why he did nothing about it 
wallach wrote that his business associate israeliborn oilman 
bruce rappaport had commissioned several public opinion polls that 
indicated a high probability of early elections and growing 
support for labor 
rappaport who resides in switzerland and is a generous 
contributor to the labor party confirmed an arrangement with peres 
that israel would receive some 700 million over 10 years from the 
pipeline that would pass near the israeli border on its way from 
iraq to the red sea port of aqaba 
what was also indicated to me is that a portion of those 
fund will go directly to labor wallach wrote 
the emigration issue as outlined by wallach revolves around 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs promise to peres to consider 
increasing emigration levels if the jews went directly to israel 
rather than to the united states wallach said 
the united states has refused to take any stand in support of 
direct soviet emigration to israel saying it was up to the jews to 
decide where they want to live

mayor raymond flynn sought the approval of the 
city council on tuesday for an experiment to provide sterile 
needles to drug addicts in an effort to curb the spread of aids 
drugusers would make periodic visits to facilities yet to be 
established for the program and would get up to seven marked 
needles each time depending on how many they returned from the 
previous visit 
when entering the program addicts would be offered a place if 
available at a drug treatment center rejected offers would be 
renewed periodically 
no one initiative to contain the virus can be the answer 
other than finding a vaccine or a cure for the disease itself 
said flynn in a prepared statement at a closed morning meeting 
attended by city councilors 
conventional antidrug measures do not go far enough in the 
short term to curb the spread of aids he said 
addicts their sex partners and their babies are the fastest 
growing group of aids victims flynn said 
among the 1230 massachusetts aids cases reported so far about 
20 percent have involved intravenous drug users more than 25 
percent of bostons estimated 14000 intravenous drug addicts are 
thought to be infected with the virus already state officials said 
council president christopher iannella is expected to assign the 
measure to a council committee for review at the council meeting 
wednesday according to flynn spokesman arthur jones 
flynn also is seeking city councils approval of a petition to 
the state legislature to bypass state laws against possession of 
hypodermic syringes by drug addicts or against dispensing such 
equipment to drug addicts 
reaction was mixed among city councilors some like councilor 
david scondras said after the meeting tuesday that he backed the 
plan because my instincts tell me this is a medical crisis and 
politicians should not stand in the way of what a doctor 
prescribes for a patient 
councilor james kelly said he has strong objections 
first i dont think the city should be giving the appearance 
that were condoning drug use which we clearly are said kelly 
second i dont think itll work 
gov michael s dukakis has opposed any needle exchange program 
and so does state public health commissioner deborah prothrowstith 
i dont think we ought to be encouraging people to shoot up 
with heroin i am against it dukakis told a news conference 
tuesday if we can get people into methadone maintenance 
programs needles cease to be a factor and that is a much much 
better to deal with this in addition to treatment 
last month the state of new york announced a plan to distribute 
free needles to drug addicts in new york city 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome which has no known cure 
has been found to be spread through sharing of infected intravenous 
needles as well as through sexual contact it damages the bodys 
immune system leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer 
as of jan 4 the centers for disease control in atlanta had 
received reports of 50265 americans with aids 28149 of whom had 
died

the activeduty strength of the nations 
military services in january was virtually unchanged from the 
previous month but more than 12000 below the same period last 
year the pentagon said tuesday 
as of jan 31 the army navy marine corps and air force had 
2167378 men and women on active duty up 767 from dec 31 figure 
that combined total represents a decrease of 12023 however 
compared with the jan 31 1987 tally the armed services reported 
activeduty strength of 2179401 a year ago 
it is not unusual for military strength to swing up and down on 
a monthly basis during the year primarily because of differences 
in the flow of new recruits the strength totals are expected to 
vary even more widely than normal this year though because the 
pentagon is reducing its activeduty strength in a budgetcutting 
move 
according to the latest military strength assessment two of 
the four armed services reported declines in personnel in january 
from december 
the marine corps reported 198243 men and women on active duty 
down 194 from december the air force reported 604574 down 755 
the army had an activeduty strength of 778835 as of jan 31 
up 1155 from december and the navy reported 585726 on active

western nations are luring away tens of 
thousands of polands most skilled professionals causing a costly 
brain drain of its best and brightest young people the 
government charged tuesday 
government spokesman jerzy urban said the west is cashing in on 
polands costly investment in education and threatening to prolong 
his countrys economic crisis 
he said more than 500000 poles emigrated to the west between 
1983 and 1987 including nearly 60000 university graduates the 
losses include 19000 engineers 5500 physicians 4800 economists 
and 4000 scientists 
there is a brain drain in the western emigration policy that 
makes it difficult for unskilled workers to remain abroad but which 
eagerly retains experts in demanded specialties urban said 
the rich west which is criticizing socialism is sucking from 
poland a part of socialisms achievement he said we are 
suffering these losses in favor of countries which in general 
are very reluctant to undertake economic cooperation with poland 
which would back our reforms 
the educations of the doctors and engineers who have fled the 
country between 1983 and 1987 is about 100 million urban said 
urbans comments read from a text at the beginning of his 
weekly news conference mirrored charges made in november by soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev 
in an interview with nbc news gorbachev replied to a question 
on the soviet policy toward jewish emigration by saying us 
officials are trying to solve their problems by organizing a 
brain drain from the soviet union 
urban did not specify what steps the government might take to 
stem the wave of emigration saying he was only appealing to all 
poles to express their views on a problem for which there is no 
simple remedy 
urban did say that western countries should take the 
consequences of the brain drain into consideration in balancing 
mutal economic relations and commitments an apparent reference 
to polands efforts to obtain new economic credits and a favorable 
debt payment rescheduling from its western creditors 
urbans remarks reflect growing concern in the country to the 
large numbers of young professionals fleeing the countrys economic 
crisis for greener pastures in the united states west germany 
italy and france among other countries 
last month a joint government and roman catholic church 
commission expressed concern about what it called an alarming 
phenomenon and called for measures to convince young poles that 
they can satisfy their aspirations in their native country 
official newspapers have printed articles about emigration 
including letters from young professionals explaining why they want 
to leave government polls have shown that more than half polands 
youth would like to stay in the west to work for two years or more 
emigration has grown since the lifting of martial law in 1983 
when the government liberalized regulations for obtaining a 
passport to travel abroad urban said poles made 42 million trips 
to western countries from 198387 
he said those staying abroad were motivated by economic rather 
than political reasons describing their attitude as 
meanspirited turning the back on the homeland instead of 
working in favor of improving living conditions 
but he added the government did not intend to withdraw from its 
liberalized passport policy 
some soviet bloc countries such as romania have demanded that 
wouldbe emigres repay the cost of their education before departing 
from 1983 to 1987 urban said 58500 people emigrated legally 
from poland including 5000 university graduates 
another 117000 people including 16500 university graduates 
traveled to the west on business or tourist trips and then stayed 
permanently abroad without consent of polish authorities 
he said 328000 people including 38000 with university 
degrees extended their stay abroad although many were expected to 
return to poland he said

state prosecutors said monday they 
wont seek criminal charges against contractors of an apartment 
building that collapsed during construction in bridgeport last 
year killing 28 workers 
chief states attorney john kelly and bridgeport states 
attorney donald browne said investigators determined that the cause 
of the collapse did not involve intentional criminal conduct on 
the part of any contractor involved in the construction 
while investigators have disclosed the most probable cause of 
the building collapse we do not believe that they have 
demonstrated either a gross deviation from a reasonable persons 
standard of conduct or that the prosecution could demonstrate 
responsibility for criminally negligent homicide beyond a 
reasonable doubt the prosecutors said in a statement 
richard bieder an attorney representing families of some 
collapse victims said authorities probably dont know all there is 
to know about the accident because some people with information may 
not have come forward 
my experience is that more of them with information will begin 
singing like canaries as the pressures of lawsuits mount he 
said 
i think theres more behind this story echoed anthony 
petta general manager of the waterbury foundation co inc which 
was a concrete subcontractor for the lambiance project and lost 11 
workers in the accident who knows what will happen after all of 
the court proceedings 
lambiance plaza a multistory apartment complex in 
bridgeports downtown was being built in the liftslab method in 
that method huge concrete floor slabs are poured and allowed to 
harden in a stack on the ground before they are jacked into place 
on steel columns 
federal authorities concluded the april 23 1987 collapse was 
triggered when a small bracket that was part of the lifting system 
bent under pressure 
the national bureau of standards concluded that builders failed 
to conduct stressanalysis tests to find out if the lifting 
brackets steel pieces measuring about 4 by 12 inches could hold 
up the concrete slabs 
the labor department assessed a record 51 million in fines 
against five companies for violations at the apartment complex the 
heaviest fines went to tpmimaycomber a joint venture of tpm 
international of darien and bh maycomber of boston which was the 
primary contractor and project manager and texstar contruction co 
of san antonio texas 
the decision announced monday by kelly and browne affects only 
state prosecution 
a regional administrator for the us occupational safety and 
health administration john miles said recently he has recommended 
federal criminal charges be filed as a result of the collapse the 
federal review process could take months 
joe egan business agent for ironworkers local 424 which lost 
seven men in the collapse said he couldnt understand the state 
prosecutors decision 
if there has to be criminal intent than most manslaughter 
cases would have to be thrown out of court egan said 
bridgeport mayor thomas w bucci declined to comment on mondays 
announcement except to say they kelly and browne are both 
excellent prosecutors and im not going to second guess their 
decision in this matter 
in a lawsuit filed oct 28 by the victims families the city 
was accused of negligence in issuing a building permit for 
lambiance plaza and in inspecting construction of the building 
david turlington a lawyer for texstar construction co of san 
antonio texas said connecticuts decision verifies that the 
cause of the disaster has not been determined and texstar continues 
to dispute the findings by the national bureau of standards and

they had the goods on bucky even if 
hed had an alibi he wasnt in a position to tell anyone about it 
but when hamilton county sessions court judge hl smith handed 
down his sentence monday maybe he took into account this was 
buckys first offense and that he was only 3 years old and also 
that he was a deer 
bucky is a whitetailed buck judged too tame to survive in the 
wild after being illegally raised on a farm since he was a fawn 
smith ordered him to spend the rest of his life in chattanoogas 
warner park zoo 
the sentence satisfied hershel bradshaw a 70yearold 
birchwood tenn man who had taken care of the deer since its 
mother and another fawn were accidentally killed by a combine he 
was operating 
bradshaw was concerned that tennessee wildlife resources agency 
officials wanted to destroy the sevenpoint buck 
for a while they were talking about taking it out in the 
woods and shooting it he said i just dont think that would 
have been right 
bradshaws attorney bob moon said his client was charged with 
illegally taking and possessing a class iv animal wildlife 
officials were told about the deer by a group of hunters who became 
angry when bradshaw would not let them shoot the animal which was 
caged moon said 
tennessee law prohibits anyone except zoos and transient 
circus acts from possessing or displaying a class of wildlife 
that includes such as whitetailed deer black bears bobcats and 
wild turkeys 
the judge said he had no intention of fining bradshaw

things are popping out on the farm thanks 
to a jump in consumption of the fluffy white snack americans devour 
by the ton each year 
production of popcorn statewide has doubled since the early 
1980s when the last official estimate was made said john unger 
statistician for the illinois agricultural statistic service in 
springfield 
consumption of popcorn has increased with the popularity of 
microwave ovens unger said the price of popcorn is up and i 
think some farmers see it as an alternative crop that will make 
them a little more money 
scott talbott of manito is hoping to take advantage of the 
popcorn craze he and his father gnile grow up to 800 acres of 
popcorn each year near this town of 1900 located 20 miles south of 
peoria 
unger estimated illinois farmers grow upwards of 35000 acres of 
popcorn each year more than double the 15000 acres reported in 
1981 in the last census 
indiana leads the nation with about 53000 acres of popcorn 
and nebraska and ohio rank about even with illinois 
deirdre flynn spokeswoman for the popcorn institute in chicago 
said industry sales started climbing in 1984 and a reported 700 
million pounds were sold in 1986

us and soviet diplomats will have a tough 
time meeting a onemonth deadline for drafting portions of a treaty 
to slash superpower nuclear arsenals government and private 
experts said tuesday 
the aspects of the agreements that they have agreed to draft 
within 30 days are important but they are appendages to the main 
treaty said albert carnesdale a former arms control negotiator 
now at harvard university 
and another former negotiator james hackett of the conservative 
heritage foundation in washington cautioned that the best way to 
get a bad agreement is to give your negotiators a deadline thirty 
days is an incredibly short time for an agreement that should take 
years to negotiate 
both the soviets and americans would have to make major changes 
in their bargaining positions to produce an agreement before a 
summit planned for moscow in late may or early june said 
carnesdale hackett and administration sources who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
secretary of state george p shultz and his soviet counterpart 
eduard a shevardnadze set the 30day deadline at their meeting in 
moscow on monday directing their staffs to reach draft agreements 
dealing with verifying compliance with the cutbacks disposing the 
weapons and exchange of information 
shultz and shevardnadze meet again in washington on march 2223 
defense secretary frank c carlucci and soviet defense minister 
dmitri yazov are also scheduled to discuss the issues at a meeting 
in bern switzerland on march 1617 
the foreign ministers announced no major breakthroughs in the 
strategic arms reduction talks start which president reagan and 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev have agreed should cut superpower 
nuclear arsenals to 6000 warheads a reduction of 30 percent to 50 
percent depending on how the weapons are counted 
among the major points of disagreement are a us proposal to 
limit the number of soviet landbased intercontinental ballistic 
missiles icbms to 3300 no more than 1630 of which can be on 
rockets carrying seven or more warheads and the soviets are 
demanding limits on the number of cruise missiles aboard submarines 
and aircraft 
one administration source said its going to be tough to get 
a deal unless the two sides agree to mix and match the formula 
adopted in the second strategic arms limitation treaty signed in 
1979 that pact set overall limits on warhead levels but did not 
achieve the limits on landbased soviet icbms that the 
administration has been seeking under start 
some analysts believe that no start deal is possible unless the 
superpowers reach agreement on the degree to which the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty limits the testing of weapons 
developed under reagans strategic defense initiative 
however congress has barred the administration from spending 
any money through next september on tests that would break the abm 
pact and us experts believe that enthusiasm for star wars will 
wane after reagan leaves office 
star wars is probably a moot point said an administration 
source 
a spokesman at the soviet embassy boris malkhov said tuesday 
that we are confident that technical obstacles can be overcome 
we have the political will and we think that president reagan 
does also to produce a start accord before the summit

postoperative trembling endured by half 
the 25 million people who undergo surgery each year results from 
the use of anesthetics not from decreased body temperature as had 
been assumed according to a new study 
the finding could lead to improved treatments to prevent the 
unpleasant and uncontrollable tremors that in some cases resemble a 
seizure and can be dangerous to patients researchers said tuesday 
we now know that a very dramatic side effect of surgery has 
been misinterpreted for more than 35 years said daniel i 
sessler assistant professor of anesthesia at the university of 
californiasan francisco and head of the study 
sessler along with researchers at ucla and the university of 
minnesota compared electrical signals produced in the muscles 
during normal shivering to those in nine women recovering from 
anesthetic after surgery they found the postsurgical tremors were 
not related to body temperature but matched tremors produced in 
people with severed spinal cords 
anesthetic they found wears off in the spine while the brain 
remains asleep essentially disconnecting the spine from the 
brains chemical messages 
if the patients skin gets cold triggering shaking the brain 
cannot signal the muscle reflex to stop sessler said after about 
15 minutes when the brain wakes up the tremor stops he said 
people have been trying to do something for years about 
postsurgical tremors but generally without success because they 
have been treating it as a thermoregulatory problem said 
sessler who reported the finding at last years meeting of the 
international anesthesia research society the study will be 
published in the journal anesthesiology this year 
dr richard stein vice president of the american society of 
anesthesiologists said the finding will not drastically alter 
current practice at hospitals which already use lamps or blankets 
once tremors begin 
but according to sessler warming the skin with infrared heating 
lamps or even something as simple as a hair dryer while the patient 
is still asleep should prevent the tremors altogether 
infrared heating lamps are used empirically in some hospitals 
and have already been shown to work said sessler but most 
dont treat this except with blankets routinely keeping the 
patient warm would prevent this even a modest increase in the 
warming system 
the shaking which can occur with almost all general anesthetics 
in use today can raise the patients heart rate and blood 
pressure in addition to pulling apart incisions and damaging 
teeth sessler said 
stein differed with sesslers estimate that half of all surgical 
patients experience some tremors from mild to severe he said such 
cases are rare and are usually not serious 
the condition is most common among patients treated in cold 
operating rooms such as those receiving hip or knee replacement 
he said orthopedic surgeons keep the temperature at around 62 
degrees because of the heavy gowns they must wear and the air 
conditioning system both designed to prevent infection he said 
in a separate study sesslers research team disproved another 
assumption that surgery patients lose all ability to control body 
temperature anesthetics do not eliminate control but instead lower 
the threshold for cold the regulatory reaction occurs but at a 
much lower body temperature than normal they found

selection of a site for the 44 billion 
super collider atom smasher will be delayed by up to four 
months to prepare a draft environmental impact statement before 
instead of after the choice the energy department said tuesday 
word of the delay from july to november or december came in 
budget questioning of secretary john herrington before the interior 
subcommittee of the house appropriations committee 
he was asked whether he would pick the site before or after the 
committee acts on his request for 363 million in construction 
funds for the fiscal year starting oct 1 
i dont see us making the decision before the committee must 
act herrington said i would guess a preferred site would be 
selected in november or december 
the department has planned for more than a year to chose the 
final site in july and confirm it in january subject to 
preparation of an environmental impact statement 
department spokesman jeff sherwood said later that doe now 
believes it is better to do more work on the environmental impact 
statement and complete a draft covering all possible sites before 
chosing the final site 
that will be on the street and people will be able to comment 
on it and well have the benefit of the comments in choosing the 
fon to delay announcement 
of a final site recommendation 
the longer you go in with this project without getting the 
funding committed the more risk there is it wont get funded 
blanchard said at the national governors association winter 
meeting in washington the more you narrow down the site 
selection the less likely congress is to fund it 
if congress builds it the superconducting super collider will 
investigate exotic scientific theories of the origin of matter by 
whirling beams of protons into each other at an energy 20 times 
greater than what is now possible 
believed to be the largest scientific instrument ever built 
state governments are anxious to win the contest for the 
53milesaround tunnel because it will create 3000 jobs and have 
an annual operating budget of 270 million 
besides michigan illinois texas arizona colorado tennessee 
and north carolina remain in the competition to build the collider

a twopackaday woman who said she smokes 
just to annoy her husband was ordered not to light up in front of 
him or their three children and to confine her smoking to one room 
of their house according to court papers made public tuesday 
the court order from state supreme court justice ralph diamond 
says elizabeth roofeh 41 of kings point on long island can be 
held in contempt if she breaks the rules 
mrs roofehs husband jahanshah a nonsmoking orthopedic 
surgeon went to court in an attempt to get his wife to stop 
smoking around the family 
he claimed she had made a promise to that effect when they 
married in 1976 she said she broke the promise in 1984 only 
because of stress after suffering a stroke 
she filed for divorce last may from her iranianborn husband 
whom she called an ayatollah 
i smoke just to annoy him mrs roofeh said last year 
ill quit when i get him out of the house 
in the suit roofeh claimed his wifes habit was offensive and 
detrimental to the health of the children aged 6 7 and 9 
the husband had argued that smoking was as bad as punching or 
spitting and asked for an order of protection but diamond said 
such orders are designed to protect family members from domestic 
violence and would be too severe a remedy 
instead he ordered that she never smoke in front of her husband 
or children and never smoke at home except in the familys small tv 
room 
mrs roofeh said tuesday that the ruling dated monday was 
nothing new 
she said she had already been refraining from smoking in front 
of the children and confining her smoking to the tv room 
in an affidavit she had agreed that smoking is detrimental to 
the health of the smoker and those who passively inhale the 
smokers smoke 
constance navesky a spokeswoman for the judge said extensive 
research into state law had not found any similar ruling

the fbi illegally obtained a suspected shiite 
lebanese terrorists confession to leading a 1985 airplane 
hijacking during relentless interrogation that violated his 
rights a judge ruled tuesday 
us district judge barrington d parker suppressed oral and 
written confessions that fawaz younis gave to agents after he was 
lured aboard an fbichartered yacht in the mediterranean last sept 
13 
parker ruled the statements were inadmissable as evidence 
because younis was denied his constitutional protection against 
selfincrimination and his right to legal counsel during four days 
of questioning aboard a navy ship in the mediterranean 
somehere along the way in its zeal and determination to 
indict and prosecute an alleged hostagetaker and hijacker under 
recent congressional enactments and in securing fawaz younis 
written confession the fbi failed to comply fully with 
constitutional restraints and predecential supreme court 
decisions parker said in a 47page opinion 
law enforcement agencies must follow the letter and the spirit 
of the law even though the accused is not a citizen of the united 
states parker said the fbi failed to do so in september 1987 
when it interrogated the defendant 
younis was arrested when a friend who had become a government 
informant lured him onto an fbichartered yacht with the prospect 
of making a drug deal prosecutors say they have a videotape and 
other statements from witnesses that place younis at the scene of 
the june 11 1985 hijacking of a royal jordanian jetliner from 
beirut international airport 
he is scheduled to go to trial march 22 before parker on charges 
that he led hijacking during which the plane was blown up after 
passengers and crew were taken off the aircraft 
although parker declined to rule that the arrest was illegal he 
concluded that the fbi deliberately kept younis aboard the uss 
butte for four days to obtain a confession in a clear abuse of 
the obligation to bring the defendant before a judicial officer 
immediately following his arrest 
the slow voyage across the mediterranean appeared to serve 
only the governments purposes ample time to educe a 
confession parker said that deliberate action coupled with 
the lengthy and relentless interrogation was all to the defendants 
prejudice and detriment 
the fbi launched its plan to abduct younis early last year under 
the direction of oliver revell the bureaus executive assistant 
director who witnessed the arrest and was aboard the butte for 
part of its fourday voyage according to testimony 
younis capacity for selfdetermination was critically 
impaired by seasickness and throbbing pain from wrists that were 
fractured when agents slammed him to the deck of the yacht skunk 
kilo following his arrest parker said 
the judge noted that the fbi kept younis in windowless 
overheated room aboard the ammunition ship as it steamed slowly 
from waters off cyprus to a rendezvous with the uss saratoga four 
days later younis was then flown from the carrier to andrews air 
force base md 
the defendant had been advised of his rights to remain silent 
once during his interrogation but in an uncertain physical 
condition in an oppressive environment and subject to relentless 
interrogation younis lacked the will necessary to voluntarily 
waive his rights parker said 
we are reviewing the decision carefully within our office and 
with our colleagues in the department of justice timothy j 
reardon iii principal assistant us attorney said in a 
statement fbi spokeswoman susan schnitzer said the bureau would 
not comment on the decision 
parker also criticized the ships doctors for providing 
inadequate medical treatment and negligent diagnosis despite 
younis constant complaints about the pain 
younis was given ice packs but his wrists were not xrayed and 
put into casts until after he was flown to washington 
parker said he was extremely troubled by the fbis failure 
to provide younis with a defense lawyer despite the meticulous 
detail of operation goldenrod the fbis codename for the 
effort 
if the fbi could arrange to have a medical surgical team of 
five doctors and several tons of medical equipment aboard the 
butte would it have been too difficult to arrange for a competent 
and detached attorney 
besides the confession prosecutors also have the testimony of 
two americans who identified younis as one of five men who boarded 
the plane with ak47 assault rifles they also have the testimony 
of jamal hamdan younis onetime friend who had several 
conversations with him about the hijacking 
in addition prosecutors have a videotape of younis reading a 
statement to reporters before the plane was blown up in the 
background

the state supreme court on tuesday 
declared west virginias 149 billion budget unconstitutional 
because it contains a deficit and the state auditors office said 
all state spending would cease immediately 
weve got to quit everything right now said don adams 
chief clerk for auditor glen gainer 
adams said no further expenditures of state money can be made 
until the 26 million deficit in the current budget is corrected 
there was a unanimous reaction of shock at the decision which 
had been pending for months 
the governor has been saying its unconstitutional since june 
im sure hell be interested to hear that said gov arch moores 
press aide john price 
moore was in washington at a governors conference tuesday and 
could not immediately be reached for comment 
the court ruled in a 32 decision in an opinion written by 
justice darrell mcgraw did not tell gov arch moore and the 
legislature what to do about the unconstitutional budget 
we presume the governor and legislature will do their 
duties mcgraw wrote 
the decision resulted from a lawsuit brought by the west 
virginia education association last year that challenged cuts in 
funding for education the association did not seek to have the 
budget declared unconstitutional but asked that moore be forced to 
call a special session to address the problem 
in his response moore did not contest the allegations and said 
the legislature budgeted 26 million more than he had said would be 
available in revenues he said the document was unconstitutionally 
out of balance 
the state constitutions requires that the estimate of revenue 
and the budgeted appropriation be in balance so as not to create a 
deficit 
but the high court said it refused to tell the legislature and 
the governor what they should do to correct the problem and 
rejected the education associations request that a special 
legislative session be ordered 
it said the branches of government are equal and the court 
presumes that the executive and legislative branches will do what 
they are supposed to do

the national park service affirmed the dream 
of a former boy scout tuesday by dedicating a national trail he 
conceived to show tourists landmarks that illustrate the rich 
history of blacks in the nations capital 
the black history national recreation trail winds from a 
179yearold cemetery in the exclusive georgetown neighborhood to 
the home of 19th century black leader frederick douglass in the 
citys poor anacostia section 
the trail is a continued and living legacy to the achievements 
of black americans said willard andre hutt 27 who started the 
drive for the trail as his eagle scout project in 1979 
dedicated to the memory of late black historian carter g 
woodson the tour through washington is part of a series of 
national park service trails such as the appalachian trail that 
represent periods in american history 
the trail includes such landmarks as lincoln park on capitol 
hill the downtown home of educator and presidential advisor mary 
mcleod bethune the metropolitan african methodist episcopal 
church the first ame in washington created in 1822 when a group 
of dissatisfied blacks broke away from a predominantly white 
church howard university founded after the civil war to provide 
higher education to blacks and the preserved home of abolitionist 
douglass 
interior secretary donald hodel urging tourists to visit the 
sites wrote in a letter that the trail will surely contribute to 
an increasing awareness of the vitality and rich history of the 
black community in washington dc 
our young people need to see these sites mayor marion barry 
jr said at a dedication ceremony they need to understand we 
didnt get to where we are because of who we are but because of 
the struggle of these people

two republicans said tuesday their 375 
million child care improvement bill is far more likely to become 
law than a multibilliondollar alternative sponsored by democrats 
its closer to what the president is going to sign than 
anything else on the table or under discussion said rep nancy 
johnson rconn house sponsor of the gop bill it is practical 
it is realistic it is doable 
the plan sponsored by johnson and sen orrin hatch rutah 
relies on state regulation and private initiatives the 25 
billion democratic proposal requires federal regulation and among 
other things provides more direct aid to lowincome families 
theres no way they can get that past a democrat president 
let alone this president hatch said 
hatch said he would have to sit down and negotiate with sen 
christopher dodd dconn sponsor of the democratic bill in the 
senate he predicted no child care bill would pass unless it comes 
close to what he has proposed 
but dodd said he and hatch already have had numerous 
conversations about the two child care proposals with little to 
show for them 
i frankly feel that under any of the presidential candidates 
i would fare better with my child care proposal than under this 
administration dodd said so unless i sense that sen hatch 
and others are willing to move more in our direction to really 
target low and moderateincome families i am going to be 
unwilling to necessarily reach a compromise this year 
hatch initially introduced his bill last year saying 
conservatives had to take a leadership role in resolving the child 
care problems faced by many working families he reintroduced it 
tuesday with some refinements and johnsons companion measure in 
the house 
the bill provides 250 million for state grants to projects 
designed to improve or expand child care or make it more 
affordable 100 million for liability pools that any licensed 
provider could join and 25 million for capital improvements to 
regulated day care homes 
in addition it would limit provider liability give tax credits 
to employers with onsite child care and offer a double tax 
exemption to families in which a parent stayed home for six months 
to care for a newborn the break would be worth about 500 to 600 
to the average family 
though some experts have said state regulation of day care is 
inconsistent and in some cases very poor johnson said that would 
change because the bill requires state regulation and will 
stimulate debate 
when that debate becomes public it results in good 
standards she said 
johnson also said the bill would decrease the incidence of 
underground providers because it addresses the liability 
problem and simplifies taxes for family day care providers 
if you dont deal with those disincentives youre not going 
to bring people into the regulated system she said 
the national governors association meanwhile urged the 
federal government tuesday to take action on child care including 
a modest commitment of funds to help poor working families 
the governors ending their threeday winter meeting in 
washington called for the public and private sectors to work in 
concert on the problem and said that despite the deficit the 
federal government should begin to take action to improve child 
care 
but president reagan on monday cautioned the governors to 
tread carefully on the issue of child care 
maybe its my conservative bent but i cant help but feel 
uneasy sometimes about proposals to seek government solutions to 
such problems reagan said 
hatch and johnson described their bill as bipartisan although 
most democrats are supporting the dodd bill introduced in the 
house by rep dale kildee dmich 
proponents of the democratic measure say a strong federal role 
is needed to unify and strengthen the current piecemeal system and 
to give the private sector a framework in which to invest 
only 5 percent of employers currently offer day care services or 
direct financial aid to pay for them

thousands of people marched in soviet armenia on 
tuesday to demand control of territory assigned to another 
republic dramatically illustrating tensions among the nations 100 
nationalities 
demonstrations in yerevan capital of the southern soviet 
republic followed protests in the disputed area a small 
mountainous region just north of turkey 
a former political prisoner said from yerevan that the 
protesters want the small area part of the neighboring republic 
of azerbaidzhan to be made part of the republic of armenia 
because many armenians live there 
other problems between different nationalities have led to 
demonstrations in the republics of kazakhstan estonia lithuania 
and latvia 
nationalist demonstrations have increased since mikhail s 
gorbachev gained power in march 1985 and adopted a policy of 
glasnost or openness on selected social issues on feb 10 he 
said developing a nationalities policy is the most vital 
fundamental issue of our society 
dissidents in moscow said tuesday at least 100000 demonstrators 
took to the streets in yerevan but a participant claimed later the 
number was 200000 in either case it appeared to be one of the 
largest unofficial gatherings ever reported in the soviet union 
the government acknowledged breaching of public order took 
place in the the disputed area nagornokarabakhskaya and said the 
territorial demands were against the public interest 
tamara grigoryants a moscow dissident whose husband is 
armenian said the disputed area in the caucasus was given to 
neighboring azerbaidzhan in the early 1920s although most of its 
inhabitants are armenian 
paruyr ayrikyan a 38yearold former political prisoner said 
in a telephone interview from yerevan that protests began late 
monday and continued tuesday yerevan is 1100 miles south of 
moscow 
no one slept all night he said we gathered at the opera 
house at about 11 pm and stayed out demonstrating until 5 am 
about 200000 people massed outside the council of ministers the 
central committee headquarters and the supreme soviet 
about onethird of armenias 33 million people live in yerevan 
ayrikyan led an underground armenian nationalist group called 
the national unification party and was jailed for 17 years 
beginning in 1969 he said he now is chairman of a nationalist 
group called alliance for national determination 
earlier this month he said the nagornokarabakhskaya 
government council asked that the region be made part of armenia 
citing the constitutional guarantee of the right of 
selfdetermination the communist party central committee rejected 
the request and demonstrations followed in nagornokarabakhskaya 
and yerevan ayrikyan said 
soldiers brought in tanks to quell protests in 
nagornokarabakhskaya and rumors circulated that some demonstrators 
were killed he said 
the government made its comment through the official news agency 
tass and the dispatch was read later on the national evening news 
program 
breaching of public order was provoked as a result of 
irresponsible calls by extremist individuals tass said of events 
in nagornokarabakhsaya 
it said the central committee holds that the actions and 
demands directed at revising the existing national and territorial 
structure contradict the interests of the working people in soviet 
azerbaidzhan and armenia and damages interethnic relations 
the central committee urged residents not to yield to 
provocations by nationalist elements and said all measures would 
be taken to safeguard public order tass reported it did not 
give the number of demonstrators or say what actions were taken to 
stop the protest 
alexander ogorodnikov a former political prisoner who lives in 
moscow said demonstrators in yerevan chanted the slogan one 
nation one republic 
karen s demirchyan the armenian communist party chief went on 
television monday night asking people to be calm but thousands 
gathered outside the opera whistled and jeered ogorodnikov and 
ayrikyan said 
police followed the demonstrators as they marched through 
yerevan but did not detain or harrass the protesters ayrikyan said 
he added that rumors were circulating of authorities sending 
martial arts experts to the city to cause disorder and provide 
police with a pretext for intervention 
problems of nationalities gained prominence last summer in the 
baltic republics and there were street demonstrations in latvia 
lithuania and estonia to mark the anniversary of a secret 
germansoviet agreement that led to the soviet takeover of the 
three countries in 1940 
on feb 16 in vilnius the capital of lithuania there was a 
heavy presence of police patrolling the streets and squares in an 
apparent move to prevent any demonstrations on the 70th anniversary 
of lithuanian independence 
estonian dissidents plan more protests wednesday 
in the central asian republic of kazakhstan at least 3000 
people rioted dec 1718 1986 in the capital alma ata to protest 
appointment of an ethnic russian to replace a kazakh as the

network news stories on vice president george 
bush were generally negative before the iowa republican caucuses 
but became much more favorable after his poor showing there a 
media analyst said tuesday 
there were 157 onair evaluations of bush as a candidate on 
evening newscasts from jan 1 to feb 16 said robert lichter who 
has been logging and analyzing television coverage of all the 
contenders since early last year 
from jan 1 to feb 8 before bushs thirdplace iowa finish 61 
percent of the evaluations were negative from feb 9 through feb 
16 between the iowa and new hamphire contests only 34 percent of 
the evaluations were negative 
lichter called the trend a dramatic upturn that illustrates 
the media tendency to treat frontrunners more critically than the 
rest of the pack 
as bushs prospects dim suddenly for the first time in 
this campaign he starts to get good press lichter said 
part of the shift involved the virtual disappearance of stories 
about bushs role in the irancontra affair lichter said before 
the iowa caucuses feb 8 there were twice as many stories about 
irancontra as there were about any other policy issue then 
irancontra dropped from sight he said 
lichter showed snippets of preiowa campaign coverage that 
included several pointed comments from bushs chief rival senate 
minority leader bob dole of kansas 
in one nightly news clip dole said bush never said anything at 
leadership meetings i dont know maybe he was just holding 
back he said in another dole said he had a record of 
leadership i cant help it if he bush cant provide any 
after the iowa caucuses sample clips showed barbara bush 
calling her husband wiser and smarter than the other 
candidates nbc correspondent tom pettit said bush was not a 
quitter hes a very determined man and a new hampshire truck 
driver told an interviewer that bush seems a lot taller and 
sterner than i thought he would be 
lichter said most positive comments come from candidates and 
their families while negative ones come from others in the race 
the trend worked to the disadvantage of democrats because they kept 
picking on each other particularly during debates he said 
sample clips of the democrats included some acerbic comments on 
the socalled massachusetts miracle touted by gov michael dukakis 
as evidence of his successful economic policies 
i went to divinity school and they have a tougher definition 
of the word miracle sen albert gore dtenn said during one 
debate 
rep dick gephardt and sen paul simon provided many instances 
of democratic sniping picked up by network news among the clips 
it is legitimate for me to say where are you going who is the 
real dick gephardt said simon defending an antigephardt 
television ad 
i asked sen simon to take those ads off television 
gephardt said and if he doesnt he should take off his bow tie 
because hes just another politician 
lichter said abc and nbc coverage of bush stayed just about the 
same after bushs confrontation with dan rather on cbs but bushs 
positive evaluations on cbs dropped sharply from about 50 percent 
to 27 percent after the setto lichter said 
lichter said the negative cbs coverage may have been one 
blip attributable to a lot of anger over the incident he 
said bush stories on cbs since iowa are in the same ballpark as 
other networks about 60 percent positive 
horserace comments about a candidates chances were not 
included in the tallies of positive and negative evaluations 
comments that were counted came from candidates their families and 
aides network correspondents independent experts and others 
lichter is a fellow at the american enterprise institute and 
codirector of the center for media and policy studies besides 
tracking network news coverage of the candidates he is also 
monitoring electionyear political humor on the johnny carson and 
david letterman shows

federal monitors of staterun family 
assistance programs should penalize only those states with 
excessive rates of overpayments a congressional study said tuesday 
moreover the report by the nationa research council said the 
current federal monitoring system should be replaced with one that 
measures state efforts to accomplish the social purposes of the 
programs rather than just financial accountability 
recommendations of the panel an operating arm of the national 
academy of sciences are based on an 18month study ordered by 
congress 
the new report focuses on aid to families with dependent 
children and medicaid a similar report issued last may 
concentrated on the food stamp program 
the underlying call for different ways of measuring 
effectiveness applied to all three programs which account for 
about 40 percent of total federal spending on the poor 
nevada is the only state that has escaped sanctions that are 
expected to total 3 billion by 1989 nearly all of the 49 states 
facing sanctions are appealing and some are challenging them in 
court 
intended to deter overpayment errors in the three programs 
penalties are imposed if a states error rate exceeds 5 percent of 
its food stamp payments and 3 percent of its afdc and medicaid 
payments 
the panel endorsed the concept of imposing sanctions for 
improperly run programs but said the overpayment error rate should 
not be the sole criteria of a states performance 
it said the present monitoring system does not provide the 
detailed data that are needed for identifying and correctioning 
problems at the servicedelivery level 
because of uncertainties in the available information sanctions 
should be limited to extremely bad performers until a more 
comprehensive method of measuring performance is developed the 
panel said 
it said federal officials should measure the states against each 
other rather than the present absolute gauge and penalize only 
those with excessively large error rates 
however the report did not specify a cutoff point as being 
exessively large and said there is no absolutely reliable 
way of determining say the 10 states with the highest error 
rates

massachusetts and wisconsin receieved top 
scores tuesday in a ranking of state environmental protection 
programs by an advocacy group the fund for renewable energy and 
the environment 
the two states received 45 points out of a possible 60 in the 
groups subjective assessments of programs in six areas surface 
water protection pesticide control highway safety land use 
planning indoor pollution and pollution from energy production and 
use 
not far behind in the rankings were california and new jersey 
with 44 points each and connecticut with 43 at the bottom of the 
list were nevada oklahoma and texas with 19 points arkansas and 
mississippi with 17 and wyoming with 15 
in the separate areas the group put these states first north 
carolina in surface water protection california in pesticide 
protection oregon in land use planning new jersey in combating 
indoor pollution maryland in highway safety and massachusetts in 
energy pollution control 
in an introduction to the report denis hayes chairman of the 
fund said slowly the environmental community has come to 
recognize that our responsibility is not discharged simply by 
passing sweeping legislation the real success must be won in 
the trenches 
the purpose of this study is to share information on how the 
battle is going in the trenches 
this is the second report from the fund last years examined 
outdoor air pollution soil conservation solid waste and 
recycling hazardous waste management groundwater protection and 
renewable energy and conservation the fund said it plans to look 
at each area every three years 
the rankings tried to account for the existence of state 
legislation the scope of programs financing monitoring and 
enforcement and indications of progress 
the report singled out massachusetts which imposed 697000 in 
penalties for water pollution under a new state program 
among other points the report said 
arkansas idaho indiana louisiana maryland minnesota ohio 
and washington have more than onefifth of the major municipal 
public treatment works in significant noncompliance with their 
water pollution discharge permits 
most states rely on local government zoning ordinances for 
controls on land use and statewide programs were found only in 
oregon florida vermont colorado hawaii and new jersey 
fortytwo states have passed laws limiting smoking in public 
places and 22 states and more than 200 local governments restrict 
smoking to some degree on the job 
though not one of the traditional environmental issues 
highways are one of our most dangerous daily environments and 
the automobile is also the machine with the single greatest 
impact on our environment accounting for half of air pollution

the army announced tuesday it intends to build 
incinerators at eight ammunition depots around the country to 
destroy old chemical weapons because it doesnt want to risk moving 
the munitions 
i think we could do it either way said james r ambrose 
the under secretary of the army and the official who made the final 
decision 
but it is my judgment in rendering this decision that it is 
much more sensible in every respect and far less complex and i 
think on the whole less risky to do it where it is 
we think we can exercise much better control on a combined 
federal reservation than we can transporting this stuff over many 
states and through cities and the like he said 
ambroses decision was hardly a surprise the army has favored 
onsite destruction of its old chemical stocks ever since it began 
studying the matter more than two years ago and just last december 
released an environmental impact study supporting that approach 
some members of congress however including rep larry j 
hopkins rky have contested the armys plans saying the service 
hasnt demonstrated the safety of incinerating chemical weapons at 
storage depots located near population centers 
hopkins said tuesday he was not surprised by ambroses decision 
but thought the army had reneged on an earlier agreement to conduct 
a more sitespecific study of each depot 
in my view onsite incineration is unsafe and unthinkable in 
madison county ky hopkins said we have the most amount of 
population and the least amount of chemicals 
the service is now constructing a prototype incineration plant 
on johnston atoll in the pacific ocean where another chemical 
weapons depot is maintained to demonstrate the safety of the 
destruction process ambrose noted 
we think these plants are extremely safe he said at a 
pentagon briefing we think the safety is greatly in excess of 
that required by any of the known rules and laws 
the armys no 2 civilian leader said the service now hopes to 
begin building the eight incineration plants by 1989 or 1990 but 
conceded that timetable could be slowed by litigation or by 
congress 
while ambrose said he was comfortable with his decision he said 
he fully expects to see lawsuits challenging the move 
ive had even some people i wont identify assure me that 
theyll sue me either way he said to laughter 
the armys stockpile of socalled unitary chemical weapons in 
which shells and bombs are filled with a variety of nerve gases and 
poisons such as mustard gas is now on average more than 25 years 
old although the army wont say how large the stockpile is 
citing secrecy classifications published estimates have ranged 
from 25000 tons to 40000 tons 
the weapons are stored at the aberdeen proving ground md 
anniston army depot ala lexingtonblue grass army depot ky 
newport army ammunition plant ind pine bluff arsenal ark 
pueblo army depot colo tooele army depot utah and umatilla 
army depot ore 
the army is under orders from congress to begin destroying the 
old stock as it begins producing a new type of chemical weapon 
considered to be more safe those new binary weapons are made 
with two harmless chemicals that are kept separate until after the 
artillery round or rocket is fired mixing then to form a lethal 
gas 
ambrose said tuesday he had closely studied the army 
environmental impact study before accepting its rejection of four 
alternatives to onsite incineration 
those alternatives included transporting the weapons by rail for 
destruction at plants to be built at tooele and anniston 
transporting by rail to a single national disposal center at 
tooele airlifting the lexington and aberdeen weapons to tooele for 
destruction with onsite destruction at the other locations and 
continued storage at the current sites 
these devices are there ambrose said theyve been there 
for some time they will not go away they should be gotten rid of 
they will not turn into something completely harmless by themselves 
i have simply concluded that the ability to control 
transportation actions and to take the necessary precautions in 
largescale movements is just much more of a formidable 
complex and uncertain task than to keep these materials under close 
control at these locations and to perform the incineration there 
the army could probably save about 200 million if it built a 
single large incineration plant instead of eight small ones but 
the risk of largescale movement of the weapons is not worth it 
ambrose added 
if all goes well ambrose said it would cost between 2 billion 
and 25 billion to dispose of the old weapons and that the job 
could be completed by 1996 or 1997 it would then take another year 
or so to dismantle the eight incineration plants he said

lieberman 45 a democratic former state senator who ran 
unsuccessfully for congress in 1980 attacked weicker for using the 
senate as a debating society for his own agenda 
weicker 56 who announced his candidacy for a fourth term 
earlier this month has made a name for himself as a liberal 
republican frequently at odds with his party and president he has 
championed constitutional issues and civil rights and worked 
against school prayer and balanced budget amendments 
the candidates will be determined at state party conventions 
this summer so far weicker is unopposed and lieberman has only 
token opposition from gary johnson who describes himself as a 
veterans rights advocate

congressional district which is situated in southwestern indiana 
in 1984 mccloskey won by just four votes in a hotly disputed 
recount after a race with republican candidate rick mcintyre of 
bedford in which more than 230000 votes were cast 
so far two republicans have filed to challenge mccloskey john

flight attendants at northwest airlines have 
voted overwhelmingly to strike the airline this weekend unless a 
contract dispute over wages and benefits is resolved a union 
official said monday 
jeff musto a spokesman for teamsters local 2747 representing 
6500 northwest attendants said 944 percent of the more than 
5000 attendants participating voted to strike saturday strike 
authorization required a twothirds majority 
the strike authorization of 944 percent reflects the 
deplorable state of labor relations at northwest airlines musto 
said at a news conference reading a statement prepared by the 
local 
northwest airlines labor relations does not comprehend the 
severity of the labor situation at this carrier the statement 
read 
northwest spokesman redmond tyler said he was not surprised by 
the strike vote and said the airline expected to continue operating 
most of its flights if a strike occurred 
meanwhile monday the teamsters union at pan am corp threatened 
to disrupt the airline over a contract impasse but stopped short of 
calling a strike 
the strike deadline for the union which represents 4500 pan am 
baggage handlers reservations clerks and other ground personnel 
passed at 1201 am sunday no negotiations were scheduled for 
monday 
teamsters officials said they would use tactics such as sending 
baggage to the wrong airports and canceling reservations 
tyler said northwest officials and the union would hold a 
negotiating session tuesday with the cooperation of the national 
mediation board and we continue to remain optimistic that our 
contract will be resolved 
the two sides have not negotiated since the national mediation 
board released them from mandatory negotiations last month when 
they deadlocked over wages fringe benefits and work rules a 
30day coolingoff period ends at 1201 am est saturday at which 
time the attendants may strike and northwest may impose a new 
contract 
about 2000 northwest managers are qualified to be flight 
attendants and would be used during a strike according to the 
airline which also advertised earlier this month for flight 
attendants 
but northwest last week told 5300 mechanics and baggage 
handlers they could be laid off if the flight attendants went on 
strike 
the international association of machinists which represents 
20000 ground workers at northwest and the pilots union have not 
said if they would honor a strike by the flight attendants 
in the last strike against northwest the machinists union 
walked out for 27 days in may 1982 
northwest merged with the minneapolisbased republic airlines in 
1986 and the company and its major unions have been involved in 
talks on new contracts ever since 
many former republic employees are paid less than their 
northwest counterparts a cause of friction between labor and 
management 
northwests latest proposal to the teamsters offers immediate 
elimination of pay gaps between former northwest and former 
republic flight attendants and deals with the other areas of 
disagreement 
the proposed fiveyear agreement calls for pay increases for 
former republic flight attendants ranging from 17 percent to 26 
percent according to terry erskine northwests vice president of 
labor relations senior flight attendants earn about 35000 
annually starting pay is about 15000 a year he said 
but musto said monday that even though it does show a pay 
raise for the republic people the end result would be a pay cut if 
you put a dollars and cents figure on things being taken away form 
the republic people 
musto said the proposal would mean less vacation pay and in 
the long run you would get less retirement benefits

a federal judge ruled tuesday that 
occidental chemical corp is liable for the cost estimated at 
more than 250 million of cleaning up the love canal landfill 
that became synonymous with environmental disaster 
after nine years of deliberations us district judge john 
curtin said occidental produced the wastes and stored them in a way 
that would eventually result in toxic leakage 
it is beyond dispute that occs disposal practices were at 
least partially responsible for the release or threatened release 
of the chemicals from the love canal landfill curtin said 
curtin said occidentals liability would be determined in 
further court proceedings involving claims against occidental by 
other parties including the state of new york and some residents 
previous estimates have ranged above 250 million 
frank ashley a spokesman for occidental petroleum corp the 
parent of occidental chemical said the company would appeal 
although we believe we are protected by insurance we intend 
further to protect our rights by appeal from this extraordinary 
decision ashley said 
at last someobo has been assigned some responsibility 
said sister marjeen hoffmann director of the ecumenical task force 
which has been an advocate for people in the love canal 
neighborhood 
this is what weve been waiting for she said 
lois gibbs a former love canal resident who now runs the 
citizens clearing house for hazardous wastes in alexandria va 
said she hopes the company will be found liable for the full 250 
million that will at least make them blink gibbs said 
roger j marzulla acting assistant attorney general in charge 
of the justice departments land and natural resources division 
said the ruling shows occidental cannot insulate itself from 
liability by blaming others 
curtins ruling upholds the federal comprehensive environmental 
response compensation and liability act of 1980 which the judge 
said was designed to compel the waste disposal industry to 
correct its past mistakes and to provide a solution for the dangers 
posed by inactive abandoned waste sites 
the law was passed 27 years after occidental yielded ownership 
of the landfill transferring it to the niagara falls school board 
occidental formerly hooker chemical and plastic co contended 
that it was not responsible for the site after 1953 when it sold 
the property to the school board which built a school on the 
grounds occidental petroleum had acquired hooker in 1968 and 
changed the name to occidental chemical 
occidental said the construction broke a clay seal on the dump 
and allowed the chemicals to leach into the environment the 
company acknowledged dumping 20000 tons of chemical wastes into 
the canal during the late 1940s and early 1950s 
martin littlefield assistant us attorney for the buffalo 
district said the decision was a great victory for the state 
because it means companies are indeed responsible for what theyve 
done in years past 
littlefield said occidental would be liable for the bottom 
line on the cleanup costs he said however the ruling allows 
occidental to sue other parties the chemical giant contends should 
share the responsibility 
nunzio loverdi president of the love canal environmental action 
committee said i think occidental should accept the decision 
and not take action against the city and school board because if it 
does we will all suffer we want to get on with our lives and put 
this behind us 
ten years ago love canal became synonymous with environmental 
disaster when state officials ordered an evacuation of children and 
pregnant women from the area because of leaking chemicals 
president carter designated the 10block site as a federal 
emergency area in 1978 
the federal environmental protection agency began the suit 
against the company in 1979 
during the next two years 728 families were evacuated many of 
those were among the 1300 former residents who accepted a 20 
million damage settlement from occidental in 1984 
today there are some 175 families awaiting the results of a 
state habitability study to decide whether they can return to their 
homes 
occidental has since proposed construction of a 
multimilliondollar incinerator complex and offered to destroy 
dioxincontaminated wastes the offer marks the first time since 
the federal and state governments took over the cleanup in 1979 
that the company has proposed any direct action or involvement in 
cleanup measures 
occidental officials are scheuled to make a formal proposal at a 
meeting march 2 in washington at the us environmental protection 
agency

former secretary of state henry a kissinger 
grudgingly supported senate ratification of the new us soviet 
mediumrange arms reduction agreement on tuesday saying it never 
should have been agreed to in its present form 
but kissinger said the treaty should be approved without 
crippling amendments because failure to do so would magnify all 
difficulties within the nato alliance 
the removal of american intermediate range missiles from 
europe is now irreversible because of the pressures of european 
public opinion and other factors kissinger told the senate foreign 
relations committee 
because of that he said defeat of the treaty in the senate 
would generate a crisis in the atlantic alliance which in the end 
would almost certainly lead to the unilateral withdrawal of us 
missiles from europe and undermine the cohesion of the alliance 
my concerns cannot be removed by the refusal of the senate to 
ratify the agreement kissinger said failure to ratify 
cannot cure its defects 
meanwhile because they had manuevered themselves into a 
position where they think they now have no choice but to stand by 
proposals they never thought would be agreed to in the first 
place 
the treaty is the result of natos 1979 dualtrack decision 
to deploy us weapons to counter soviet ss20 mediumrange 
missiles while at the same time negotiating their removal 
they felt the obligation to imply that these weapons were 
there for arms control purposes and were therefore open to 
negotiation kissinger said of the european political leaders 
kissinger said he believes the treaty is flawed because it will 
not reduce in any significant way the ability of the soviet union 
to devastate europe with other nuclear weapons and because it 
substantially reduces the ability of the united states to retaliate 
with nuclear weapons based in europe 
nuclear deterrence in europe will now rely primarily on weapons 
based in the united states and kissinger said that creates a 
psychological and political imbalance especially when weighed 
against soviet superiority in conventional forces 
but he said rejection of the treaty would severely undermine 
confidence in american leadership demoralize the alliance and 
ignite neutralism 
sen david boren dokla chairman of the intelligence 
committee said his committee has high confidence in the 
ability of the united states to verify soviet compliance with the 
treaty 
but theres a very big question mark about our ability to 
verify a separate treaty providing deep cuts in longrange 
nuclear weapons boren said in an interview 
the problem there is one of money not technical ability he 
explained we have the capability but the administration has to 
come forward and propose a budget plan to pay for it 
the intelligence committee has been holding closeddoor hearings 
for three weeks about verification capabilities 
in his testimony glitman provided a detailed analysis as part 
of the senates thorough examination of the pact signed 10 weeks 
ago by president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the 
treaty will eliminate all nucleartipped missiles with ranges of 
about 300 to 3000 miles 
armed services committee members say the detailed scrutiny is 
needed because of disputes about the meaning of past treaties 
particularly the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
the current treaty is being considered by the senate amid a 
fight between the democraticcontrolled congress and the reagan 
administration over the precise meaning of the 1972 pact and 
whether it banned futuristic weapons such as those being developed 
under the strategic defense initiative 
article 14 of the intermediaterange nuclear forces inf treaty 
says neither side shall do anything now or in the future to 
undercut the pact 
sen dan quayle rind told glitman that im concerned about 
article 14 because it might limit future us help to other nato 
nations 
if we dont spell out what the future obligations are said 
quayle down the road i can foresee some problems now is the 
time to give us as much running room as possible in the future for 
our technology 
but glitman took the opposite approach noting that the treaty 
is extremely specific in spelling out prohibited weapons along 
with their components 
if it is not prohibited by the treaty we can do it said 
glitman later he added that were best protected by stating 
what we cannot do 
glitman cited one method in which he said us aid to nato would 
not be affected the treaty bans cruise missiles he said but it 
doesnt block the transfer of us technology to nato nations such 
as great britain to develop cruise missiles 
glitman said the us negotiating team resisted soviet efforts 
to block us help for nato we knew their goal was to find a way 
to put a brake on nato activities he said 
reagan promised tuesday that the united states will do its part 
to ensure that the nato alliance remains strong saying in an 
address broadcast to europe that our destiny is coupled with 
yours 
in the address which came a week before a nato summit meeting 
reagan reaffirmed the alliance agreement that an attack on any 
member nation is an attack against all of them simply put an 
attack on munich is the same as an attack on chicago he said

simmering dispute over pentagon budget cuts as his new secretary of 
the navy 
the white house said the president will nominate ball a former 
capitol hill aide who has been chief lobbyist for both the state 
department and the white house to succeed james webb who resigned 
as navy secretary on monday with a blast at secretary of defense 
frank c carlucci 
we look to will ball to continue working aggressively for a 
strong us navy white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
noting webbs charge that carlucci had needlessly sacrificed the 
administrations goal of a 600ship fleet 
fitzwater said the administration still seeks a 600vessel navy 
but now expects that the goal will be reached in fiscal year 1992 
more than two years after reagan leaves office rather than in 
fiscal 1989 as originally planned 
the budget restructuring under way at the pentagon now is a 
difficult and painful process fitzwater said secretary 
carlucci is doing an admirable job hes quite capable and suitable 
to the task and hes carrying out thepresidents policies in that 
regard 
of ball he said all of us who kfw him here at t ze 
house know that the navy is getting a strong advocate and a strong 
fighter both on the hill as well as in any of the other courts of 
public opinion around the country 
ball 39 a softspoken southerner who came to washington as an 
aide to former sen herman talmadge dga has a reputation for 
skill at the behindthescenes compromises and maneuvers needed to 
steer legislation through congress 
webb on the other hand was more noted for outspoken advocacy 
of such controversial positions as his criticism of the service 
academies admission of women and his ruling that the navy would no 
longer accommodate officers who want to play professional sports 
ball has been assistant to the president for legislative affairs 
since february 1986 before that he had been assistant secretary of 
state for legislative and intergovernmental affairs from 1981 to 
1985 he was administrative assistant tohen sen john tower 
rtexas serving also as chief clerk of the senate armed services 
committee in 1981 he was talmadges administrative assistant in 
1978 
a native of south carolina he is a graduate of the georgia 
institute of technology and was a regular officer in the navy from 
1969 to 1975 
as secretary of the navy ball will oversee approximately 
584000 navy personnel and 199000 marines 
he will be succeeded at the white house by a deputy alan 
kranowicz who has been primarily responsible for white house 
lobbying efforts in the house kranowicz served as chief of staff 
to former rep tom loeffler rtexas while loeffler was in 
congress 
fitzwater said webb did the honorable thing in resigning 
when he could no longer support the presidents policies he said 
webbs service was distinguished and the president appreciates it 
very much 
later the white house released a letter from reagan to webb 
accepting the resignation with regret and saying as your 
service to this administration comes to a close i want to thank 
you for the selflessness and loyalty that you have always 
personified 
defense department spokesman dan howard said the pentagon is 
very pleased that someone with such positive credentials has been 
named so quickly 
it is a painful restructuring they are having to go through to 
absorb some of those reductions in spending levels the 
presidential spokesman said the president has been a strong 
advocate of the military and has worked hard to build it up over 
many years and feels that pain no less than anyone else 
the budget cuts being carried out by carlucci the former white 
house national security adviser who succeeded caspar w weinberger 
at the pentagon late last year result from a compromise reached by 
reagan with the democraticcontrolled congress 
in his budget message delivered last thursday to congress 
reagan said he had kept his part of the bargain and expected them 
to keep their part by appropriating the full amount agreed upon for 
pentagon spending 
balls nomination requires confirmation by the senate he is 
expected to have little difficulty since the nomination will be 
reviewed by the senate armed services committee many of whose 
members know him as a former aide to the panel and to tower who is 
a former member and chairman 
in announcing his resignation monday webb charged that carlucci 
had instructed him to deny news stories reporting that it was the 
defense department not the navy that wanted to mothball ships 
he also said carlucci needed to spend a lot more time with the 
top leaders in this building the pentagon but instead had been 
spending a lot of time with the state department and a lot of 
time on the hill 
carlucci declined to respond saying only that he had learned of 
webbs resignation with regret

pat robertson suggested on tuesday that 
political motivations lay behind the timing of sexualmisconduct 
allegations against tv evangelist jimmy swaggart and he also 
accused george bushs campaign of planning religiously bigoted 
television commercials 
he provided no evidence to support his accusation on the timing 
of the swaggart story and he declined to say who might be behind 
any such effort however he said the vice presidents campaign was 
the only one in the gop presidential race that has been engaging in 
dirty tricks 
robertsons comments brought heated denials from bush others 
in the vice presidents campaign 
asked about robertsons charge during a campaign stop in st 
louis bush challenged him to prove it 
later in london ky bush was asked if he could say his 
campaign had no connection with the timing of the swaggart story 
thats a hundred percent accurate he replied 
bush said he saw no reason anyway to connect the swaggart story 
with robertson himself a former television evangelist 
i dont think its fair to burden pat robertson with something 
with jimmy swaggert i dont think thats fair play bush said 
on the other hand if he accuses me of something im perfectly 
prepared to defend us 
in washington south carolina gov carroll campbell bushs 
state campaign chairman said if somebody makes a specific 
charge then they certainly ought to have to come forward with some 
proof i think its a rather ridiculous charge myself 
robertson said evidence indicating swaggart had been involved 
with prostitutes had lain dormant since last october 
it stretches the imagination and stretches credulity that 
revelations of such allegations came two weeks before the most 
important primary in the nation the republican candidate said 
during a news conference he was referring to the primaries and 
caucuses that 20 states will hold on march 8 known as super 
tuesday 
i think somebody had something to do with it said 
robertson somebody else planned all these things i am afraid 
he also said bushs campaign was guilty of dirty tricks against 
him and was planning more in the form of advertisements before the 
super tuesday primaries 
they will attack my religious beliefs and practices and im 
going to call them before it happens robertson said 
bush officials said that accusation wasnt true 
robertson declined to say what led him to make the charge 
concerning his statement that the swaggart controversy was 
politically orchestrated he said a prominent journalist whom he 
declined to name told me something like that might have gone 
on he said it was the news medias duty to determine whether or 
not it was true

a space agency engineer who pressed for 
a delay in the launch of the illfated space shuttle challenger 
started work monday at the private aerospace company that built the 
shuttle booster rocket 
judson a lovingood 51 joined several other topranking 
officials in leaving the marshall space flight center since the 
seven crew members died in the challenger explosion two years ago 
lovingood retired saturday from the national aeronautics and 
space administration where he had worked for 25 years instead of 
taking an assignment at nasa headquarters in washington as deputy 
director of systems engineering and analysis for the shuttle 
program 
he elected to retire in lieu of accepting the assignment for 
economic and other reasons said a marshall spokesman dave 
drachlis dr lovingood has said that he has worked on the 
shuttle since 1969 the challenger accident has exacted a great 
personal toll and he felt it was time for a change 
lovingoods new job is technical director of morton thiokol 
he said through a thiokol spokeswoman that he will be 
responsible for overseeing some technical activities at the 
huntsville division of morton thiokol whose main shuttle plant is 
in utah his activities were not specified but he said the 
companys huntsville operation has little connection with the 
shuttle program 
lovingood was deputy manager of the shuttle projects office at 
marshall when morton thiokol engineers recommended against 
launching the shuttle in cold weather at cape canaveral on jan 28 
1986 
i was contacted about 430 that afternoon jan 27 by a guy 
from the cape lovingood said 
a point was being made and the point being that i heard that 
thiokol people were recommending that we not launch he said i 
felt like with a recommendation like that that we shouldnt launch 
period 
a presidential commission that investigated the disaster 
concluded that the decisionmaking process prior to the launch was 
flawed with the views of morton thiokol engineers overruled and 
critical concerns not relayed to top nasa levels where officials 
were pushing for a launch 
the commission said flawed orings in the booster rocket allowed 
hot gases to leak through to the external fuel tank

pat robertsons campaign lawyer contended 
tuesday that the campaign has not used the 65 million it received 
in federal matching funds even though its financial report shows it 
has less than that on hand 
the matching funds were used to secure a 55 million loan 
during january said campaign attorney marion harrison but he 
added that the campaign does not consider that was using the money 
the matching funds are 100 percent in an escrow account and 
none has been spent harrison said in a telephone interview 
when asked why the campaigns financial statement filed with the 
federal election commission showed 55 million in cash on hand 1 
million less than the matching funds he said were in the bank 
harrison said he did not prepare the report and could not explain 
it 
campaign aides did not return calls monday and tuesday to answer 
questions about the report 
whether or not the robertson campaign has accepted the matching 
funds is significant because presidential candidates who are 
declared eligible for such funds must abide by spending limits 
under federal regulations 
the robertson campaign contends that it does not have to abide 
by the limits unless it actually uses the money and considers that 
although it put the funds into its bank it still has the option of 
sending the money back and bypassing the spending limts said 
harrison 
that will be our contention if we decide not to accept them 
harrison said its a decision that hasnt been made yet 
fec spokesman fred eiland said thats sort of a dubious 
argument but the commission would have to answer that 
he noted that candidates must sign an agreement to abide by the 
spending limits even before they actually get the matching funds 
the spending cap issue is more important for robertson than for 
any other presidential candidate because he is by far the closest 
to the limit 
the cap is 23 million for the primary season plus another 20 
percent or 46 million allowed for fundraising expenses 
as of the end of january robertson reported spending 176 
million against the 23 million cap plus 43 million against the 
fundraising cap 
those figures did not include februarys spending toward the 
iowa and new hampshire contests tuesdays south dakota and 
minnesota contests or the super tuesday primaries in 20 states on 
march 8 
harrison said the 55 million loan from sovran bank in virginia 
was secured but neither he nor the banks regional executive 
officer earl slattum would disclose what collateral was required 
the loan was bigger by far than any taken out by the other 
candidates 
election law requires that banks treat presidential campaign 
loans in the normal course of business with no special 
considerations applied 
slattum cited customer privacy considerations and refused to 
divulge any information about robertsons loan the banks general 
lending practices or even the cities included in the region 
slattum heads 
slattum and harrison also declined to give the date the loan was 
taken out although fec spokesman eiland said that is required on 
the disclosure reports the report listed the date only as january 
1988 
robertson also used his matching funds to secure a 15 million 
loan in december from sovran bank that loan was paid back on jan 
10 
robertson reported spending during january of 79 million more 
than any other presidential campaign and ended the month with 55 
million in cash on hand and 6 million in outstanding debts

a new election system in which people vote 
for candidates by lining up behind them led to one death and 
widespread charges of fraud kenya newspapers reported tuesday 
the purpose of monday nights voting was to choose parliamentary 
candidates for kenya african national union of president daniel 
arap moi kenyas only legal political party 
john matere keriri who was assistant transport minister but 
failed in his nomination bid called the vote an absolute sham a 
fraud not an election 
keriri and a few other losing candidates claimed they or their 
agents were arrested and harassed by partisan officials the night 
before the monday vote and that several agents were barred from 
polling stations 
one man identified as a keriri supporter died and two other 
people were hospitalized in the northern kirinyaga district where 
violence was used to keep some people from voting newspapers 
reported 
the elections marked the partys first test of the new system 
and a muchcriticized regulation that allows nominees with more 
than 70 percent of the vote to enter parliament unopposed 
at least 30 candidates received more than 70 percent 
church leaders lawyers and a few politicians have called the 
lineforming system as intimidating and said the 70percent rule 
disenfranchizes nonparty members 
under the new system voters lined up behind candidates and 
officials took a head count 
government officials contend the new system will prevent 
corruption and give the party rank and file a greater voice 
candidates previously were chosen by the party chairman 
secretarygeneral and treasurer 
preliminary results indicated poor turnouts in many 
constituencies the standard an independent nairobi newspaper 
reported hundreds of eligible voters milled outside some voting 
locations and only a few lined up to vote 
it appeared more people came as spectators than as voters 
it said 
anglican bishop david gitari accused election officials of 
trying to rig the ballots he said the election official at one 
polling station refused to count heads when more people lined up 
behind keriri than behind his opponent 
official tallies were expected later this week in the week 
presidential nominations are due saturday but noone is expected 
to challenge moi he has held the office since the death of the 
first president jomo kenyatta a decade ago

view 
but sen claiborne pell dri the committee chairman read an 
administration statement denying that 
the statement called the helms assertion incorrect and added

mediumrange missile force after the new treaty is ratified by the 
senate

a former county assistant judge who was the 
focus of misconduct charges against three state supreme court 
justices has been convicted of lying under oath 
a vermont district court jury found former chittenden county 
assistant judge jane wheel guilty late monday after more than six 
hours of deliberations said court spokeswoman harriett eitapence 
an attorney for wheel found guilty of three counts of lying 
under oath said he would try to have the verdict set aside 
wheel 55 was charged in october 1986 for her actions during an 
inquest earlier that year into allegations that she had padded her 
paycheck 
the prosecution maintained she lied when asked if she had 
altered court files to indicate that she was sitting in court on 
days she actually was elsewhere judges are paid for time spent 
hearing cases 
assistant judges in vermont are elected lay people while 
regular judges are lawyers appointed by the governor wheel was a 
high school english teacher until her election in 1974 and had long 
been active in democratic politics 
lay judges who make up the states superior court system hear 
mostly civil cases although before court reorganization several 
years ago they also often heard criminal cases 
the charges against wheel who was defeated in a september 1986 
election rocked the states judiciary because of her association 
with three vermont supreme court justices 
misconduct charges were filed in january 1987 by the judicial 
conduct board against wheel former supreme court justices william 
hill and thomas hayes and justice ernest gibson iii accusing them 
of using their influence to help wheel while she was under 
investgation by the attorney generals office in the 
paycheckpadding case 
hayes died last year and charges against gibson were dropped 
wheel and hill await proceedings before the conduct board 
the board is slated to take up 12 counts against hill on march 7 
one of the misconduct counts alleges that hill berated an 
employee of the chittenden county superior court when she walked 
into a room and saw wheels arms around hill 
another alleges that wheels friendship with hill was so open 
that an employee of the court called hill at home and warned him 
that unless he altered his behavior in front of wheel it could do 
serious damage to his reputation 
another charge alleges that hill talked improperly outside the 
courtroom with wheel about a case that had been tried in her court 
and was being appealed before him at the supreme court level 
during the trial assistant attorney general david suntag 
portrayed wheel as someone who had been caught in a web of lies and 
deceit as she signed her name to the court folders to cover up the 
fact she had hardly sat in court on cases for a year 
she lied under oath and no amount of talking about lots of 
other things and no amount of changing stories can change 
that suntag told the jury 
wheels attorney richard davis said he would move to have 
mondays verdict set aside on grounds that the evidence did not 
support a guilty finding 
during the trial which began jan 25 davis had argued that 
wheel was the victim of a vendetta by court personnel 
wheel faces a maximum penalty of 15 years in jail and a 10000 
fine for each of the three counts no sentencing date had been set

stjean quebec ap andre bissonnette who was dismissed from 
the federal cabinet after news reports linked him to a questionable 
land deal was acquitted tuesday of four charges of fraud breach 
of trust and conspiracy 
normand ouellette bissonnettes close friend and political 
associate was convicted of one count of fraud but acquitted of one 
charge of breach of trust one count of conspiracy to commit fraud 
and one count of conspiracy to commit breach of trust 
charges were filed after a series of sales that tripled the 
price of a piece of land in stjean from 800000 to 298 million 
in 11 days of january 1986 the canadian dollar is worth about 79 
us 
oerlikon aerospace inc contracted to buy the land 13 weeks 
before the federal government awarded it a 600 million contract to 
build canadas lowlevel air defense system 
prime minister brian mulroney fired bissonnette 42 of stjean 
a day after reports of the land sales were made public last year 
he had been junior transport minister 
in ottawa mulroneys office released a statement saying the 
prime minister is very pleased that mr bissonnette has been fully 
exonerated by a jury of his peers the statement said nothing 
about bissonnettes chances of getting back into the cabinet 
the jury was told to decide whether steps taken by ouellette 
that drove up the price were objectively dishonest and whether 
bissonnette helped him 
judge jeanguy boilard of quebec superior court also instructed 
the jury to determine whether bissonnette knew of methods used by 
ouellette who managed his blind trust 
prosecutors alleged that bissonnette and ouellette used 
privileged information to profit illegally from the sale 
bissonnette denied in court that half the profit from the final 
transaction in which ouellette was involved wound up in the bank 
accounts of himself and his wife 
bissonnette smiled slightly as the verdict was read he later 
crossed the room patted ouellette on the back and wished him luck 
bissonnette a selfmade millionaire was known as the chicken 
king of quebec because one of his companies supplied much of the 
barbecued chicken sold in restaurants in the province 
outside the courthouse he shook hands with several jurors he 
thanked mulroney for supporting him over the past 13 months and 
said he would leave any decision about his political future up to 
the prime minister

sen bob dole fought his gop presidential rivals in the south 
dakota primary and minnesota caucuses tuesday as vice president 
george bush all but conceded defeat in advance massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis dueled richard gephardt and the rest of the pack 
for fresh momentum in the democratic race 
the two states were billed as the gateway to super tuesday a 
midwestern opportunity to demonstrate electoral strength before the 
march 8 festival of delegaterich primaries and caucuses mostly in 
southern and border states 
dole was rated the heavy favorite in the south dakota republican 
primary as he bid to rebound from last weeks drubbing in new 
hampshire 
as the polls were closing cbs news and abc news projected that 
dole would win the republican primary in south dakota cbs said 
bush and former television evangelist pat robertson in a tight race 
for second place in the gop race 
abc also projected gephardt as the winner in south dakota 
the kansas senator also campaigned hard in minnesota but 
robertson dreamed of an upset and rep jack kemp made an allout 
effort as well 
bush who finished third in the iowa caucuses earlier this 
month made little effort in the two neighboring midwestern states 
he spent little money in minnesota and withdrew television 
advertisements from south dakota stations 
democrat dukakis fresh from a triumph in the new hampshire 
primary aimed for a convincing win in minnesota as he bid to 
demonstrate that his candidacy has appeal outside new england iowa 
caucus winner gephardt sen paul simon and jesse jackson also vied 
for support as they sought standing in the race before the primary 
and caucus calendar turned south 
dukakis and gephardt each hoped for a win in a heated south 
dakota race sen albert gore jr invested heavily in television 
advertising as well hoping for a strong showing outside his 
native south in advance of super tuesday 
simon who once said he would quit the race if he failed to 
score a victory in either state stepped back from that standard 
late last week and vowed to stay in the race no matter where he 
finished 
gary hart his comeback candidacy in tatters after poor finishes 
in iowa and new hampshire campaigned hard in south dakota 
for hart gore jackson and robertson south dakota posed a 
financial test as well each man finished with less than 10 
percent of the vote in new hampshire and a similar result in south 
dakota would deprive them of federal matching funds beginning in 30 
days a candidate can requalify by gaining 20 percent of the vote 
in a future primary 
the states offered a bewildering array of delegate selection 
provisions 
south dakotas democratic vote was a preferential poll designed 
to serve as an advisory opinion to a statewide caucus on march 12 
that will allocate 15 of the states 19 delegates 
but minnesotas democrats began the selection of 78 of the 
states 87 delegates to the partys nominating convention in 
atlanta in july 
south dakotas republican primary voters picked all 18 of the 
states delegates to the gop nominating convention in new orleans 
in august 
minnesotas republicans expressed their presidential preferences 
through a straw vote and selected delegates to begin the process of 
picking 31 national convention delegates

general motors corp plans to reopen 
its assembly plant here in may and rehire about 1800 of the 3700 
workers who lost their jobs when it closed in november a gm 
official said tuesday 
company officials were aiming for may 9 as a startup date but 
the reopening could be delayed an additional week said gm regional 
manager joseph nedrow one shift would return to work he said 
were hopeful were going to have a second shift later 
in the year depending on whether car sales pick up further nedrow 
said in a telephone interview a formal announcement on the startup 
will be made wednesday he said 
nedrow spoke shortly after sen edward m kennedy dmass said 
he had been told that gm would reopen the plant may 9 a spokesman 
for massachusetts gov michael s dukakis said state officials also 
had been informed the plant would reopen 
gm closed the plant nov 31 blaming sluggish sales of the 
midsized chevrolet celebrity and oldsmobile cutlass ciera assembled 
at framingham 
at the time the company said it hoped to reopen the plant in 
the spring industry analysts had predicted such a move was 
unlikely because the plant is nearly 40 years old and projections 
call for a continued decline in sales of the models made there 
attempts to reach officials of united auto workers local 422 for 
comment were not immediately successful telephone calls to the 
union office were not answered 
dukakis a presidential candidate praised gm in a statement 
issued by his office for keeping its pledge to reopen in the spring 
but since this is only a partial reopening i am still very 
concerned about the workers who are not returning to the jobs at 
the plant 
i commend gm for this decision kennedy said i will 
continue to work with gm and the uaw to resume full production as 
soon as possible

the senate launched a fullfledged 
filibuster tuesday as majority leader robert byrd ordered 24hour 
sessions to subdue republican opposition to a democratic campaign 
financing bill 
the talking broken by occasional roll calls began about 2 pm 
and continued into the night appointments were canceled schedules 
revised senators began catching up on paperwork and cots were set 
up in rooms near the chamber 
byrd lacking the votes to prevent republicans from stalling 
action on the legislation threatened to keep the senate in session 
indefinitely 
weve decided well just go aroundtheclock the west 
virginia democrat said at midafternoon after republican and 
democratic negotiators reported making no progress on the central 
question of spending limits 
were going to talk or were going to vote said byrd 
warning that foes of the campaign finance legislation would have to 
keep control of the floor to prevent a vote 
democrats and republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a 
year over a democratic bill with 52 cosponsors that would set up a 
system of voluntary spending limits for senate general election 
campaigns 
the limit would be from 950000 to 55 million depending on a 
states population the bills supporters say limits are needed to 
put a brake on the increasing cost of getting elected up from an 
average of 600000 in 1976 to 3 million in 1986 
in larger states growing numbers of candidates are spending 
more than 10 million to win a senate seat with increasing amounts 
of campaign funds being supplied by specialinterest political 
action committees 
a candidate observing the voluntary limit would get campaign 
funds from the treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or an 
independent group spent large amounts of money against the 
candidate 
republicans who have made opposition to limits a party issue 
succeeded last year in preventing the senate from voting on the 
legislation winning a record seven cloture votes during 22 days of 
floor time 
byrd even with the support of three of the senates 46 
republicans is believed to be five votes short of the 60 needed to 
cut off debate and force a vote on the bill 
the senate is in a fullfledged filibuster said byrd 
adding that he would no longer confine debate to daylight hours 
theres no point in continuing the casual gentlemanly 
goodguy filibuster because it will just turn out like it did last 
year he said lets have it on the floor where the american 
people can see it 
four democrats and four republicans have been negotiating since 
last week they reported progress on some facets of the bill but 
not on spending limits which republicans say will discriminate 
against them in states with a heavy democratic edge in registered 
votes 
the chief negotiators said their positions on the key issue were 
solid 
a limit on spending is something this side is not going to 
agree to said mitch mcconnell rky that is not one of the 
negotiable items 
his counterpart david boren dokla was just as adamant 
any bill that does not limit campaign spending would not be real 
reform 
boren said however that democrats are willing to discuss 
higher spending limits in states where their party enjoys a big 
advantage in registration or historically has dominated 
congressional elections 
there was no public response from mcconnell who said 
republicans were willing to discuss compromise on another 
democratic demand putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate 
can get from political action committees 
boren and mcconnell said negotiators had neared informal 
agreement on other issues including controling how much personal 
money a millionare can put into his or her campaign requiring 
broadcasters to charge rockbottom rates for political ads better 
disclosure of money going to political parties and getting 
controls on socalled soft money which includes groups like 
labor unions supplying people to help candidates with canvassing 
and phone banks

democrats who chose a candidate in the final 
days of the south dakota primary race went strongly tuesday for 
rep richard gephardt who employed aggressive television 
advertising in his winning campaign 
among the republicans network exit polls said conservative 
voters helped pat robertson challenge vice president george bush 
for second place while sen bob dole of kansas won with broad 
support 
a third of the democratic voters told cbs news they made up 
their minds in the last three days of the race and 45 percent of 
them backed gephardt compared to 23 percent for massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis gephardt had trumpeted a key endorsement and 
attacked dukakis in television advertising 
gephardt and dukakis who finished second split the liberal 
vote but gephardt won the moderate and conservative democrats won 
the male vote while splitting the female vote with dukakis and won 
among the less wealthy and the less educated again splitting the 
others with dukakis the polls suggested 
surprisingly the nbc news poll found that a plurality of south 
dakota democrats 46 percent said they believed dukakis eventualy 
will win the presidential nomination even though not all voted for 
him 
on the republican side bushs identification with president 
reagan failed to help his cause the same problem bush suffered in 
the iowa caucuses feb 8 the polls indicated bush finished third 
in iowa to dole and robertson 
dole won the republican primary bush and robertson were locked 
in a race that was too close to call and rep jack kemp was a 
distant fourth 
gephardt won the democratic race dukakis was running second and 
the remaining candidates were tightly bunched well back 
dole campaigned determinedly in south dakota while bush steered 
clear of the state the exit polls indicated that dole won strongly 
in nearly all categories abc news for example found that dole 
won more than seven in 10 liberals and moderates and four in 10 
conservatives 
robertson was second among conservatives with 27 percent in 
abcs poll according to network poll analyst doug muzzio kemp was 
well back with 8 percent of conservatives 
cbs said robertson a former television evangelist won support 
from 51 percent of evangelical christians who made up about a 
fifth of the republican electorate 
republicans who support president reagan helped bush win the new 
hampshire primary but in south dakota nearly half of the 
republicans who favor reagan 56 percent of the total went for 
dole abc found about a quarter each backed bush and robertson 
among the losing democrats nbc found that former sen gary hart 
of colorado who won the state in his 1984 bid for the nomination 
was viewed unfavorably this year by twice as many south dakotans as 
viewed him favorably roughly 60 percent said they were not pleased 
that hart reentered the race after withdrawing last summer amid 
questions about his marital fidelity 
the cbs survey had a margin of sample error of 4 percent abcs 
was 5 percent and nbcs was 3 percent the networks did not poll in 
minnesota which held precinct caucuses tuesday rather than 
primaries

few people will remember the full name of what 
was until recently the fourth largest law firm in the united 
states 
but few who watched its rise to glory will soon forget the 
spectacular fall of finley kumble wagner heine underberg 
manley myerson amp casey 
as recently as last summer finley kumble was a growing 
thriving concern or so it seemed 700 of the countrys hottest 
lawyers chasing after business with an aggressiveness and a 
flamboyance that shook up the profession 
its partners included three former us senators a onetime new 
york governor and an exmayor of new york city in addition to 
lavish headquarters on park avenue it had major branches in 
beverly hills miami and washington dc and smaller offices 
throughout the united states and abroad its clients included 
citibank shearson lehman brothers and real estate developer donald 
trump 
by the end of the year finley kumble was gone vaporized 
says founder steven kumble and its lawyers were hiring lawyers 
for the battle over what remained an 83 million debt 
the fabric of a law firm is a very delicate thing kumble 
says now if you tear it it can unravel very quickly and that 
is what happened in this case 
ambition jealousy and greed were the instruments of destruction 
at finley kumble where top partners waged internal warfare and 
borrowed money to pay their own salaries which were among the 
highest in the profession 
as the yarn unraveled publicly in the legal press last fall the 
profession looked on with morbid fascination tinged with glee and a 
bit of introspection 
finley kumble was never popular among other lawyers and judges 
it was too big too brash too noisy and didnt play by the old 
rules it lacked gentility but for all its excesses the firm 
embodied many of the changes that have been sweeping the legal 
profession for the last two decades 
law firms once operated like exclusive private clubs 
now large firms are absorbing smaller ones partners who once 
considered a change in firms to be tantamount to divorce are doing 
what many married couples have done in recent years finding new 
partners firms that 20 years ago were unlikely to have even one 
branch office outside their home city are now spreading around the 
globe 
finley kumble was among the biggest of the national superfirms 
it didnt grow organically like the old establishment firms 
when it wanted new partners it went out and bought them in many 
respects finley kumble operated more like the multinational 
corporations it served than the law firms it challenged 
i do think its a harbinger of sorts said richard abel a 
professor of law at the university of california at los angeles who 
is studying the development of the legal profession certainly 
many lawyers are viewing it as a cautionary tale and a worrisome 
one 
finley kumble was founded in 1968 by eight new york lawyers led 
by kumble a graduate of yale university and harvard law school who 
was 35 years old at the time kumble says he had no grand plan he 
just wanted to practice law 
the firm grew gradually in its first decade by 1978 it had 70 
lawyers all still in new york they were doing very well 
basically the firm grew because we expanded to meet the 
needs of our clients says kumble we didnt set out to grow 
we set out to build a law practice 
things began to change in 1978 recognizing the growing 
importance of los angeles as a financial and corporate center 
finley kumble took on marshall manley as its first california 
partner and allowed him to begin building the firms first branch 
office in beverly hills 
as it grew the california office began to challenge the 
dominance of new york in 1983 in a bitter power struggle manley 
persuaded management to let him become comanaging partner along 
with kumble 
by then finley kumble had 283 lawyers only 100 of them in new 
york there were 86 lawyers in beverly hills 63 in a new 
washington office 26 in miami and eight in san diego the firm was 
on the move 
in the next four years finley kumble would more than double in 
size and open new offices in chicago dallas baltimore downtown 
los angeles baton rouge la tallahassee palm beach and ft 
lauderdale fla newport beach and sacramento calif and london 
it would recruit former sens paul laxalt russell long and 
joseph tydings to join former new york gov hugh carey and former 
new york city mayor robert f wagner sr 
it would become one of the most highprofile firms in the 
country with lawyers and legal publications constantly discussing 
its aggressive tactics and its philosophy of meritocracy in 
which lawyers were said to be rewarded according to the business 
they generated not the years they served 
but the battle for control of the firm continued first it was 
manley after he left in 1986 it was a new partner harvey 
myerson who struggled with kumble 
the showdown came in february 1987 at a management committee 
meeting in miami the firms officers voted to strip kumble of 
power which fell to myerson and robert washington jr head of the 
washington office 
the expansion continued but through that spring and summer 
unsettling reports made the rounds among lowerlevel partners 
according to these partners the rumors said the firm was in debt 
deeply in debt 
new york partner peter fass says the bottom line for him was the 
discovery just a few months after he joined the firm in january 
1987 that more than half the firms profits were borrowed 
the ship was already underwater when i got there but i didnt 
know about it fass said a lot of people who had been there 
for a number of years had no inkling what was going on 
what was going on many partners later charged was that the 
managing partners had hidden the borrowing by creating a separate 
corporation that took out bank loans to buy up the firms accounts 
receivable the unpaid bills of clients 
this money was then used to pay the generous salaries of the 
firms superstar lawyers many of them lured in the firms final 
year of furious expansion laxalt and long were said to have been 
offered 800000 a year

in september the borrowing scheme was divulged publicly in an 
extraordinary frontpage article in the american lawyer magazine by 
editor steven brill it was titled bye bye finley kumble 
and it was prophetic 
it was devastating said one los angeles partner who like 
many people interviewed for this article would speak only on 
condition of anonymity that article i think was really the 
beginning of the end 
in it brill not only laid bare finley kumbles financial 
morass in excruciating detail he also castigated the firm for what 
he viewed as a misplaced sense of priorities 
it has become a place wrote brill where the only 
corporate culture is money where things like pro bono charitable 
legal work or collegiality are sissy stuff which means that when 
the money dries up even temporarily theres no other glue there 
no shared values to hold the place together 
toward the end of the summer lawyers were leaving finley 
kumble in growing numbers after brills article the stream turned 
to a torrent by the beginning of december branches were closing 
and it became apparent that the firm could not survive on dec 21 
at a sparsely attended meeting in new york the remaining partners 
voted to disband as of jan 4 
a fourmember liquidation committee is now sorting the firms 
accounts trying to determine how its assets stack up against the 
83 million debt one washington partner estimates that as much as 
60 million can be squeezed out of the firms real estate accounts 
receivable and other assets but he said the process could take 
years 
im sure that five years from now there will still be some 
quivering in the corpse he said 
meanwhile two lawsuits have been filed by california partners 
richard osborn and david ellsworth and others are expected osborn 
and ellsworth allege that they were misled about the financial 
health of the firm and should not be responsible for repaying the 
debt 
four banks have sued charging that all partners are responsible 
and that some assets have been hidden some partners who have 
signed individual settlements with the banks were not named in the 
suit and more such settlements are likely 
what went wrong at finley kumble the consensus is that the 
firm grew too far too fast exercising questionable business 
judgment along the way 
its level of borrowing was almost unheard of among law 
firms according to jack kaufman chairman of an american bar 
association committee on law office management and president of 
hildebrandt inc the nations largest legal management consulting 
firm 
in fact until recently law firms didnt borrow period 
kaufman said 
kumble counters that the firms loans were no different from 
those employed by many corporations it was a big business and 
it borrowed like big businesses do he said 
the problem he said was that when adversity began driving 
partners away from the firm those remaining couldnt support the 
debt and as they realized that they left too 
and what of brills contention that finley kumble lacked the 
loyalty friendship and shared goals that hold law firms together 
that it was a place to do business nothing more 
ive had more conversations with other people in two weeks 
than i had in 11 months at finley kumble said fass now at 
another manhattan firm there nobody cared what you did so long 
as you brought in money 
still finley kumbles basic business strategy national 
growth corporatestyle aggressiveness was far from unique 
ten years ago only two law firms in the united states had more 
than seven branches according to uclas abel in 1987 there were 
13 such firms ten years ago no firm had more than 300 lawyers in 
1987 there were 38 
abel said the growth has been disproportionate among the 
lowestpaid attorneys the associates whose fees help pad the 
profits of increasingly wealthy partners 
others say simply that the growth has been triggered by a new 
intensity in competition that has forced firms to reach out for new 
business 
its gotten to be a very tough competitive marketplace 
kaufman said 
kumble who is now chairman of lincolnshire management a firm 
that arranges and finances leveraged buyouts prided himself as a 
seer of the legal profession often to the irritation of his 
competitors he is giving no ground now 
i think a lot of firms are emulating what finley kumble did 
in terms of being a national law firm in terms of lateral 
recruitment of partners in terms of expansion and i think that 
will continue he said 
the problem we had is that our management committee became 
very politicized i dont think the concept was flawed i think 
the combination of people we had didnt work cohesively it wasnt 
the concept it was the people

despite her opposition to apartheid despite her 
work as a un delegate despite her awardwinning efforts for 
human rights miriam makeba insists she is an artist not a 
politician 
it was as an artist that the empress of african song first spoke 
out against the system of discrimination in south africa 
testifying before the united nations special committee on apartheid 
in 1963 in retaliation south africa banned her records 
afterward i tell the press i am not a politician or a 
diplomat makeba writes in her recently published autobiography 
makeba my story written with james hall new american 
library 1895 
i am just a singer i say but in south africa when the 
authorities learn of my testimony i become something else a 
criminal 
makeba my story recounts some of the joy and sadness in 
the life of one of south africas most acclaimed singers who has 
been in exile from her native country since 1959 
she decided to write her autobiography five years ago i never 
really wanted to write a book besides i dont know how to write 
however makeba said friends convinced her of the books 
importance she was the first artist to leave the country and 
make some type of impact on the world while not forgetting the 
problems that exist in south africa 
they said that if anything should happen to me others could 
write whatever they wanted without my being able to say whether 
its true or false she said 
it was so hard every time i read it i just cry this morning 
i was looking at the book i looked at it for maybe for 10 
minutes and i was crying 
the book coincides with the release of sangoma the singers 
first american album since the late 1960s it is a collection of 19 
african songs sung in three languages the songs were taught to 
makeba by her mother who was a sangoma the south african term for 
a healer in close communication with ancestral spirits 
sangoma is the most personal record ive made makeba 
said i like the songs because every time i sing them i think 
about my mother because she sung them 
born in johannesburg on march 4 1932 with the xhosa tribal 
name zensile makeba has survived bitter personal and career 
setbacks 
when she was just 18 days old she went to jail for six months 
with her mother who had illegally brewed homemade beer to support 
the family later after her mother was released the family moved 
to pretoria where they endured the hardship of apartheid 
at a young age she found joy in singing some of the songs 
protested her countrys white minority regime the songs were a way 
she and others could demonstrate their defiance in school and 
church choruses 
makeba started her professional career in 1952 she was chosen 
as the female vocalist for one of the countrys top bands the 
manhattan brothers 
in 1955 she accepted a small role in the documentary come 
back africa based on the life of a murdered black boxer harry 
belafonte spotted her in the film helped her to obtain a visa and 
then boosted her career when she arrived in the united states in 
1959 
she writes in her book that belafonte or big brother as 
she calls him gave her this advice you must always be careful 
how you conduct yourself on stage and off because some day you 
will have a chance to speak on behalf of your people 
with her click singing and deep but lilting voice makeba 
created a sensation in her first american tv appearances and new 
york club dates and she was received by the late ethiopian emperor 
haile selassie cuban president fidel castro the late president 
john f kennedy and other world leaders 
in 1960 her mother died and she wished to return home to visit 
her grave and see relatives she went to the south african 
consulate in new york 
the man at the desk takes my passport he does not speak to 
me but to himself when he says miriam makeba as if he was 
expecting this moment she writes he takes a rubber stamp and 
slams it down on my passport then he walks away i pick up my 
passport it is stamped invalid 
she has not been allowed to return to south africa since 
her troubles were not limited to her native land she has been 
married five times including once to south african trumpet player 
hugh maskela but her career in the united states was most affected 
by her marriage to black activist stokely carmichael 
i never had any problems with the officials in this country 
its just that when i married stokely many concerts that were 
booked for me were canceled i guess because some people took my 
marriage so personally she said 
and when that happened i had a tour planned in europe so i 
just packed up and went to some of my friends in guinea 
her friendship with guineas president sequo toure led to her 
work as a guinean delegate to the united nations 
more recently makeba completed six months as a special guest on 
paul simons graceland world tour which included her longawaited 
return to the united states 
when we went to zimbabwe it was another experience she 
said just looking out from the stage and seeing all those people 
tight in the stadium black people white people from all walks 
of life just swaying together to the music it was so beautiful 
it made me almost cry because i said why cant it be like 
that just next door because we were right next door from home 
makeba hopes that one day she will return to south africa 
i guess if i stop believing that i will go home there would 
really be no purpose for anythingshe said

in 1972 shirley strum found herself alone with 
a troop of baboons among the spare scattered acacia trees on the 
plains of east africa a jacket knotted around her waist and a 
clipboard in her hand 
a graduate student in anthropology at the university of 
california berkeley strum had been dispatched to kenya to observe 
the baboons she knew little about them and she knew less about 
survival in the african wilderness 
it was only total ignorance of what i was getting into that 
gave me the courage to go she said recently in an interview 
strum was supposed to stay in kenya for 18 months just long 
enough to collect the data she would need to write a phd thesis 
instead she made kenya her home 
by 1976 her studies had grown into the gilgil baboon project 
she now employs six fulltime researchers 
strum has written a lively personal account of the project in 
almost human random house 2250 she was in new york to 
promote the book which synthesizes the ideas she has developed 
during 15000 hours of watching baboons in kenya during the past 15 
years 
in almost human she compares the behavior of the olive 
baboon papio anubis to the behavior of homo sapiens her studies 
vividly recounted in the book challenge the accepted wisdom that 
baboons are brute aggressive beasts in so doing the studies have 
changed her thinking about human nature 
if baboons were aggressive then the killer ape was where we 
started from she said early baboon studies formed part of the 
underpinning for the idea widely popularized in the 1960s by the 
writer robert ardrey that a killer ape lurks inside each of us 
humans are fundamentally aggressive ardrey wrote in african 
genesis and nothing we do can change that we can only control 
it 
that is not what strum found however she draws an engaging 
picture of baboons as sophisticated creatures who prefer 
negotiation and persuasion to aggression 
the old picture was of a society in which males held all power 
and used force to attain dominance strum found that males were 
transients and that they did not arrange themselves in a hierarchy 
with dominant males on top she found that females were the stable 
core of baboon troops and were ranked in a dominance hierarchy 
females not males were the linchpins of baboon society 
they did not however exert their dominance over the males 
it turns out to be a society where there is a complementarity of 
roles strum said even if you have dominance and aggression in 
the traditional sense it doesnt explain everything 
no one suggests that the hominids or humanlike creatures that 
gave rise to humans resembled baboons but said strum if baboons 
had developed to the point where they no longer relied on naked 
aggression then humanitys early ancestors probably did too 
its impossible for me to believe that the early hominids were 
less sophisticated than baboons she said thus our early 
ancestors may have abandoned aggressive social practices long ago 
strum grew up in san diego and she had no plans to become an 
anthropologist when she left home in 1965 for the university of 
california but the turmoil of those years in berkeley made a mark 
on her 
as i lived through the free speech movement and the vietnam 
war protests i found myself confronting over and over questions 
about human nature about what was innate and impossible to modify 
and what was flexible and worth changing she writes 
she drifted in and out of the psychology and sociology 
departments before fixing on anthropology she fell under the spell 
of sherwood washburn a leading american anthropologist who had 
done some of the first observations of baboons in the 1950s and 
60s it was washburn who said go out and watch baboons 
thats what she did for six years keeping careful records of 
her observations in june 1978 at a conference on baboon behavior 
organized by strum she presented her findings to her colleagues 
the 10 worst days of my life followed she writes 
other baboon watchers at the conference couldnt accept her 
conclusions or her methods when she arrived in kenya she decided 
to follow baboons on foot rather than watching from a van as her 
predecessors had done that was partly what enabled her to learn so 
much about baboon society rival baboon watchers criticized me 
she writes i was interfering ruining the baboons 
it took time but strum overcame her disillusionment with her 
colleagues and won many of them over as that crisis resolved 
however she faced a crisis of a different sort in africa the 
baboons she had come to know so intimately were in danger the 
undeveloped ranch on which they had been allowed to roam had been 
sold and it was being divided into 5acre and 10acre parcels the 
baboons wilderness would soon be farmland 
strum and her colleagues made preparations to do the unthinkable 
to relocate the baboons to another wilderness area no one had 
ever attempted to move a group of nonhuman primates from one 
wilderness area to another 
the search for a new location proved difficult but at the last 
minute a site was found the animals were difficult to capture 
they were being moved to an area where they would have to learn to 
eat new foods would they survive 
they would its been a great success strum said the 
animals adapted well and with strums help survived a dry period 
shortly after arriving at their new home the success of the move 
has made translocation an option for conservationists she said 
unwittingly the baboons had given me much over the years 
personally and scientifically she writes now i had been able 
to reciprocate by giving them a chance for a better future

former dukes of hazzard star tom 
wopat is battling his spirited good ole boy image with love 
songs and a new tv show about modern family issues 
wopat is starring in the new cbstv drama blue skies and 
is maintaining a singing career with country musicoriented songs 
that have a more romantic feel than driving soupedup cars as the 
adventurous luke duke 
blue skies is scheduled to begin this spring and the action 
involves coping with contemporary issues such as aging and 
alcoholism rather than rural escapades with his blond buddy john 
schneider 
it was a golden opportunity to be involved with fine persons 
and escape the good ole boy stereotype the 36yearold wopat 
said im a totally different character in dukes everything 
was fantasy in blue skies its straightforward and as near to 
life as possible 
i feel its the type of show the public is looking for as 
shown by the success of our house he said its about three 
generations of family and the problems of the parents and their 
families 
wopat and schneider and their high powered car the general 
lee costarred in dukes of hazzard for seven seasons beginning 
in 1978 since then both have gone on to country music careers and 
remained in acting 
he and schneider just reunited in a holiday special christmas 
comes to willow creek which did well in the ratings he sees 
schneider six to 10 times a year 
i love him dearly he said hes like a brother we shared 
so much and we were in so many scenes together we genuinely liked 
each other and had the same interests 
we decided from the beginning it was going to be fun and wed 
enjoy it and i think this came across on the screen its not 
common to have two leading men who got along as we did 
looking back on the highly rated dukes wopat said it was 
popular because it was different 
until then urban halfhour comedies were on we were a new 
rural show that was action oriented with some violence and exciting 
stunts it was a calculated approach a darkhaired boy a 
lighthaired boy a mean old man a nice old man a comical old 
man a pretty girl 
it was pure entertainment kids could watch it with older 
people there was no cussing and no sex except for catherine 
bachs legs there was a little moral message once in a while and 
it was oriented to family not like dallas or dynasty 
there were imitators but we outlasted them all no show will 
ever be seen again like it the cost is too high 
wopat who directed some episodes of dukes is selecting 
songs now for his second album the first was tom wopat a little 
bit closer a cut from the album a little bit closer is the 
current release and has zipped up the country music charts 
two previous songs have reached the top 20 on the charts the 
rock and roll of love and susannah he and his band 
southwind do four to eight shows a month 
since dukes he has performed in two stage musicals 
carousel in washington and offbroadway in olympus on my 
mind 
hes not done quite as well musically as schneider whos had 
no 1 country music songs such as ive been around enough to 
know whats a memory like you doing in a love like this 
and country girls 
its been a long and frustrating process except when you have 
a passion for it wopat said about his music career were 
looking for a song to make a big difference that big hit that 
changes everything 
im still in the process of making believers out there in my 
commitment to country music i think i can broaden the base of 
country music because of my visibility on tv im optimistic about 
my future in country music i think ill be here for a long time 
wopat who was raised on a small dairy farm in lodi wis says 
he watches very little television these days mostly cheers and 
reruns of the andy griffith show he hasnt seen reruns of 
dukes of hazzard for a long time 
i have them all on tape i got one out a while ago and looked 
at how i directed it

serious swingers fantasy bud shank and bill perkins 
 
halfway through this record you swear youve heard this music 
somewhere before you have if you listen to side 1 
the most noteworthy thing about this album is that it marks only 
the second time these two longtime studio musicians have recorded 
together the first time was in 1954 
however the title is serious swingers and this album 
doesnt pretend to be any more than a good time incidental music 
for a saturday night 
in the jungle of overproduced pop jazz and fusion albums there 
is a place for people who want to swing to plow straight ahead in 
familar fields yet this record somehow leaves an empty feeling 
all the chops are just right the solos just free enough that you 
know they werent charted the mix of ballad and swing ever so 
correct 
a solid rythym section drives bill perkins tenor sax and bud 
shanks alto 
but the bottom line is this material has been done before and 
better by many if you want the real thing instead of an homage 
check out early miles davis or thelonious monk or charlie mingus

jimmy rowlesred mitchell contemporary im glad there is 
you 
 
this is a collection of simply played standards spare in 
phrase but beautifully executed 
jimmy rowles lilting piano combines with the delicate brush 
work of colin bailey on rodgers and hammersteins it might as 
well be spring to create music mindful of the first scents of 
early april 
on the title track rowles brings out the passion those simple 
words have exchanged by trusting lovers stacy rowles charming 
trumpet solo to close the piece seconds the emotion 
red mitchell shows his style without imposing on any of the 
arrangements with that need that bass players sometimes exhibit to 
prove they can do more than keep the beat 
there is no flash in this record only clean playing that sets a 
pleasant content mood

two of the nations biggest and bestknown airlines are facing 
strike threats over wages benefits and concessions that reflect 
growing hostility between labor and management in the intensely 
competitive deregulated industry 
pan am corp and the union representing 4500 ground employees 
in 14 cities remained deadlocked monday following the breakup of 
their talks union leaders in new york threatened to call a strike 
at any time and vowed guerrilla war tactics that included 
losing passenger bags and canceling reservations 
at the same time in minneapolis flight attendants at northwest 
airlines voted by a 944 percent majority to strike this weekend if 
a contract dispute over wages and benefits is not resolved 
the strike authorization of 944 percent refects the 
deplorable state of labor relations at northwest airlines said 
jeff musto spokesman for the teamsters local 2747 representing 
6500 northwest attendants 
officials at both airlines said managers would replace strikers 
in the event of walkouts and predicted minimal disruption but the 
threat of a labor rebellion at pan am already appeared to be 
discouraging potential passengers 
its a very bad situation for everybody said david perlman 
president of dms travel in midtown manhattan some people are 
shying away from pan am flights 
perlman said his agency has been using double bookings as an 
insurance technique for customers booked on pan am flights for 
passengers taking pan am from kennedy airport to europe on monday 
night for example he also booked them on flights offered by other 
airlines to the same destinations 
the union threats against pan am came against a background of 
staggering losses for the eighthlargest us airline which once 
dominated overseas travel but has been struggling over the past 
several years because of high costs and growing competition from 
other carriers a partial result of airline deregulation a decade 
ago 
pan am management has demanded 35 million in concessions from 
the teamsters who control ground workers at boston detroit 
chicago seattle san francisco san diego los angeles honolulu 
houston washington new york and the florida cities of tampa 
orlando and miami 
prospects of a strike disruption at northwest were considered 
less severe partly because flight attendants are the most easily 
replaced of all airline workers but the carriers machinists and 
pilots unions have not said whether they would honor a strike by 
flight attendants 
northwest and its major unions have been engrossed in talks on 
new contracts since the 1986 merger with republic airlines another 
result of deregulation which made northwest the fifthbiggest us 
airline 
many former republic employees are paid less than their 
northwest counterparts a cause of friction between the airline and 
its unions 
northwests latest proposal to the teamsters offers immediate 
elimination of pay gaps between former northwest and former 
republic flight attendants the union claims the company is 
compensating by reducing vacation pay and retirement benefits

ohios new antitakeover law a key element of 
federated department stores incs strategy to thwart a hostile 
acquisition by canadian developer campeau corp has been 
invalidated by a federal judge 
the ruling monday by us district judge carl rubin was regarded 
as at least a temporary victory for campeau which has been 
pursuing the cincinnatibased retailing giant with a takeover offer 
valued at 54 billion 
rubin granted campeaus request for a preliminary injunction 
against the new statute which was passed as an addition to the 
states existing takeover law he said the new measure 
unconstitutionally discriminated against certain businesses and was 
an improper regulation of interstate commerce 
mike webb a spokesman for the ohio attorney generals office 
said state officials had not decided whether to appeal the ruling 
a federated spokesman declined comment 
federated stock rose 50 cents a share monday to 6075 in active 
new york stock exchange trading 
the ruling removed one legal obstacle to campeaus efforts to 
acquire federated which has been spurning the canadian concerns 
offers 
campeau has a pending 61 a share hostile tender offer totaling 
about 54 billion it also has made an alternative offer to 
acquire the retailer for 66 a share about 58 billion in a 
definitive merger agreement 
the torontobased company had indicated the antitakeover law 
could prove to be an impediment in arranging financing for the 
acquisition 
campeau also has challenged another recently passed 
antitakeover law in delaware where federated is incorporated 
rubin said ohios law violated federal measures aimed at 
avoiding inconsistent regulation of commerce among states 
the judge said the ohio law is discriminatory on its face 
because it regulates only takeovers by certain businesses organized 
in foreign countries he said federal law prohibits such 
discriminatory legislation by states 
the judge agreed with campeau attorneys that the canadian 
corporation could suffer irreparable injury because of the law 
federateds board of directors on friday rejected campeaus 66 
a share proposal saying they were not convinced that campeau had 
solid financing for the deal 
federated operates department and massmerchandising stores in 
36 states and had sales of more than 11 billion last year its 
divisions include abraham amp straus and bloomingdales of new york 
bullocks and i magnin in california richs in atlanta filenes 
of boston and burdines of florida

santa fe southern pacific corp is 
pondering a proposal from henley group inc to scrap part of the 
railroadenergy giants restructuring and sell 780 million in new 
stock to the dissident investor 
the move which would boost henleys stake in chicagobased 
santa fe to 343 percent from 157 percent was announced monday 
and faced an uncertain reaction from santa fe which has been 
fending off henleys unwanted overtures since mid1987 
santa fe spokesman robert gehrt said the proposal would be taken 
up at santa fes regularly scheduled board meeting later today but 
would not comment further 
henleys proposal called for santa fe to stop the planned 
payment of 5 per share in highyield junk bonds for each of 
its 1573 million shares on march 1 santa fe already has made a 
25pershare cash payout 
henley has claimed persistently that the payinkind debentures 
would leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the 
way they are structured 
instead henley proposed that santa fe sell henley 780 million 
worth of new stock at 1750 per share proceeds from that deal 
would be used to make a onetime 5pershare cash payout to all 
current shareholders 
the proposed deal would mean 446 million new shares for henley 
and would boost santa fes total shares outstanding to 2019 
million but henley said the proposal was dependent on santa fes 
annulment of a poison pill takeover defense that would make a 
hostile acquisition prohibitely expensive 
under the measure if any hostile suitor exceeds 20 percent 
ownership in santa fes stock other santa fe shareholders would be 
permitted to buy new stock at half price 
henley now owns 246 million shares or 157 percent of santa 
fe a railroad land and natural resources concern that has been 
attempting to restructure because of federal regulatory rulings 
forcing it to sell one of its two railroads either the santa fe 
line or southern pacific line 
together those lines constitute the nations thirdlarges rail 
system extending over of 26000 miles of main track 
henley repeatedly has criticized santa fes adoption of the 
poison pill saying the measure restricted the ability of major 
holders to maneuver 
in another development monday concerning santa fe denverbased 
rio grande industries inc filed an application with the interstate 
commerce commission to acquire the southern pacific line for 1 
billion 
the icc already has approved an expedited schedule for the 
application with a final decision expected in six months rio 
grande said 
rio grandes action threw into question kansas city southern 
industries incs rival bid of more than 125 billion for the 
southern pacific

lf rothschild holdings inc a venerable 
investment firm that once served wealthy clients later became 
dangerously diversified and was devastated by the october stock 
market crash is selling itself to a kansas company despite earlier 
vows to remain independent 
the announcement on monday signaled the latest casualty from the 
stock collapse and the first major wall street firm to be acquired 
by a savings and loan company it also marked the end of an era for 
the 89yearold brokerage which had been hemorrhaging even before 
black monday oct 19 
since then several small firms have been forced out of 
business and ef hutton group inc one of the nations largest 
investment firms agreed in december to be acquired by shearson 
lehman brothers inc 
rothschild which also announced a 1288 million loss for the 
final quarter of 1987 previously had sold virtually all its retail 
stock brokerage operations cut staff by more than 40 percent and 
undertaken several other austerity moves 
the firm said it would merge with stern brothers amp co an 
investment bank in kansas city mo wholly owned by franklin 
financial services inc which in turn is owned by franklin savings 
of ottawa kan 
the purchase price still was subject to adjustment but 
estimated at about 440 in cash and securities for each of 
rothschilds 151 million shares or about 664 million 
franklins major subsidiary is franklin savings institution 
which had 9 billion in assets at the end of 1987 it also has 
brokerage insurance mortgage banking and financial consulting 
operations 
the merger will form a unique investment banking 
combination said ernest fleischer chairman of franklin savings 
who along with his wife owns just over half of the companys stock 
it brings together the advantages of a new york trading desk and 
regional distribution 
our stern brothers clients will receive expanded underwriting 
and distribution capabilities for lf rothschilds clients we 
will provide risk management and solid financial backing he said 
franklin financial will provide a 2year 30 million loan to 
lf rothschild amp co the brokerdealer subsidiary of lf 
rothschild holdings the announcement said 
in a separate announcement rothschild holdings reported severe 
losses for both the fourth quarter and all of 1987 reflecting both 
the impact of the stock market crash and other troubles 
rothschild lost 1288 million on revenues of 325 million in 
the quarter compared with a net loss of 154 million on revenues 
of 924 million in the same period of 1986 
for the full year it lost 1291 million on 4614 million in 
revenues compared with an aftertax profit of 498000 or 3 cents 
per share on 4011 million in revenues in 1986 
it said approximately 56 million of the losses resulted from 
arbitrage and overthecounter trading positions held during the 
stock markets collapse an additional 15 million in losses 
stemmed from the postcrash bankruptcy of haas securities a 
correspondent firm of rothchilds brokerdealer subsidiary 
in addition rothchild said quarterly and annual losses 
reflected at least 28 million in charges related to cutbacks in 
staff and offices and the sale of its retail brokerage business 
once considered a specialty investment banking house that 
serviced extremely wealthy clients rothschild later evolved into a 
publicly held firm that expanded into government bonds mutual 
funds arbitrage and other areas 
the company encountered trouble in late 1987 when a management 
dispute surfaced over whether the company was becoming excessively 
diversified two rothschild principals who opposed diversification 
abruptly quit and the firm foundered thereafter 
andrew l berger rothschilds president had said in a 
statement to the press on dec 7 that the firm intended to remain 
independent get our house in order and as quickly as possible 
return this business to profitability 
the company has scrapped its public finance and municipal bond

eastman kodak co completed its effort to 
buy sterling drug co today by acquiring more than 96 percent of 
sterlings stock during the 20day tender offer a kodak spokesman 
said 
kodak acquired about 545 million shares of sterling stock by 
the midnight monday deadline and will now complete the merger in 
the matter of a few days said kodak spokesman ron roberts 
the acquisition the largest in kodak history has attracted a 
great deal of criticism from stock analysts who said kodak was 
paying too much for the drug and household products company 
kodak had agreed to pay 8950 a share for the 57 million 
outstanding shares of sterling stock which is more than 34 higher 
than the stock was selling for at the end of 1987 the total value 
of the deal is expected to be 51 billion 
sterling based in new york has 22000 employees and has annual 
sales of about 2 billion 
kodak based in rochester has 124000 employees and annual 
sales of about 13 billion a year 
the acquisition will help kodak move into the 110 billion 
pharmaceutical industry and give the company an established 
pipeline to get drugs to market said kodak spokesman charles smith 
but analysts have cast a wary eye on the deal with several no 
longer recommending the purchase of kodak stock 
on monday kodaks bond rating was downgraded by moodys 
investors service from a2 to aa2 largely because of the impending 
51 billion loan the company is going to have to take on to pay 
for sterling 
sterlings bond rating was also downgraded from a2 to aa1 
with the acquisition kodak gets a business featuring such 
familiar brand names as bayer aspirin panadol nonaspirin pain 
reliever lysol disinfectant dcon rat killer and phillips milk 
of magnesia 
kodak officials have said they do not plan to sell any parts of 
sterling and will keep the companys organization intact

two stock specialist firms have agreed to give 
up their roles as marketmakers in three stocks the new york stock 
exchange said 
the moves are part of a review of the performance of specialists 
during the october stock market crash the exchange said in a press 
release monday 
the big board said that lawrence odonnell amp co would 
surrender its marketmaking role in neimanmarcus group inc common 
stock next week la branche amp co will give up its rights to market 
ef hutton group inc and ag edwards inc on march 3 
the franchises in the affected issues will be reallocated by the 
exchange nyse officials said in the case of ef hutton a large 
securities firm due to be merged with shearson lehman brothers 
holdings inc the stock is expected to be delisted by the exchange 
around march 24 
the exchanges 53 specialist firms each control lucrative 
franchises to market certain stocks and are required to maintain 
orderly trading in those issues by setting opening prices and 
covering trades when there are too few buyers or sellers 
following the crash the exchange launched investigations into 
the volatile behavior of some issues and the specialists assigned 
to them the activity of market specialists also was criticized by 
a presidential task force and the securities and exchange 
commission in their separate probes of the october collapse 
the nyse said the agreements with lawrence odonnell and 
labranche were reached voluntarily after discussions with the firms 
in the case of labranche the exchanges review centered on the 
firms handling of hutton stock but because of the imminent 
delisting of that issue the firm also agreed to accept the 
withdrawal of its edwards franchise as a penalty the exchange 
indicated 
the exchange did not disclose the results of its investigations 
into the trading of hutton and neimanmarcus stock but extreme 
volatility appeared to have prompted the inquiries 
the nyse has taken action in four situations since the crash 
previously spear leeds amp kellogg surrendered its franchise in 
jp morgan amp co stock and jj meehan amp co withdrew its rights 
to gould inc 
exchange officials would not say whether its inquiries into the 
activity of specialists were continuing but nyse chairman john 
phelan has told congressional investigators that reallocations of 
stock franchises was one means of repairing the damage caused by 
the crash

grain and soybean futures prices opened lower 
today on the chicago board of trade 
soybean futures succumbed to followthrough selling from 
mondays weak close and to reports of improved growing conditions 
for the south american crop analysts said 
wheat prices fell in reaction to the agriculture departments 
announcement that it plans more auctions of surplus wheat in 
addition to the weekly auctions that have been a fixture since 
november analysts said 
the auctions increase the supply of wheat on the open market 
which tends to depress prices 
corn futures prices retreated on a lack of bullish fundamentals

federal reserve chairman alan greenspan said 
today the country faces formidable challenges in keeping the 
economic recovery alive urged further progress on reducing the 
federal deficit and cautioned congress against passing 
protectionist trade legislation 
greenspan confirmed that the central bank in an effort to keep 
the recovery alive had taken a small easing step a few weeks 
ago 
the fed chairman said the central bank agreed with the reagan 
administration that recovery from the 198182 recession should last 
through this presidential election year but said prospects for 
growth would be enhanced through further efforts to reduce the huge 
federal budget deficit which raises us dependence on foreign 
investment 
we face formidable challenges over 1988 and beyond in meeting 
national economic goals of sustaining growth and progress toward 
price stability greenspan told a house banking subcommittee 
greenspans comments came as part of the feds semiannual 
report to congress on the conduct of monetary policy it was the 
first time greenspan has delivered the monetary report since he 
took over as chairman from paul volcker in august 
volcker repeatedly lectured congress during his eight years as 
fed chief over the need to reduce the soaring federal budget 
deficits and warned that the central bank could not be expected to 
carry the full burden of keeping the economic recovery going 
greenspan sounding very much like volcker echoed those same 
themes contending in his testimony that the challenge of managing 
the economy cannot be negotiated by the federal reserve alone 
for the united states the most direct and beneficial approach 
would be to address the problem at its major source the federal 
budget deficit he said reducing the deficit further would 
give us the opportunity to add to domestic saving and reduce 
dependence on foreign capital while still encouraging muchneeded 
investment spending 
since january a variety of interest rates including home 
mortgage rates have declined leading many economists to speculate 
that the federal reserve had eased credit conditions 
greenspan confirmed the move toward easier money saying the fed 
had made the change amid indications of an economy that was slowing 
as the year began he said the fed had the leeway to loosen credit 
conditions because the us dollar had stabilized on foreign 
exchange markets 
for part of last year the central bank had been forced to push 
interest rates higher in an effort to support the dollar which was 
declining rapidly in value higher interest rates in this country 
tend to make dollardenominated investments more attractive to 
foreignes 
the fed released an economic forecast that was very close to the 
predictions made by the reagan administration when it released its 
budget last week 
the fed said it believed the overall economy as measured by the 
gross national product would grow at rate of 20 percent to 25 
percent this year down from last years growth of 38 percent the 
administration is forecasting 24 percent gnp growth this year 
while many private economists believe growth will not reach 2 
percent 
in response to a question greenspan said that while the fed was 
expecting sluggish economic growth this year it saw no evidence 
that a recession would occur because the economy was not exhibiting 
the kinds of imbalances that normally start appearing at the end of 
an expansion 
greenspan was asked by rep charles e schumer rny whether 
over the next 12 months he saw a greater danger of increased 
inflation or recession 
greenspan paused a moment and then responded at the moment i 
would say the dangers are probably equal its very difficult to 
judge 
at another point greenspan disagreed openly with a contention 
by beryl sprinkel president reagans chief economist that the fed 
had pursued a tight monetary policy during 1987 
we did not perceive ourselves as being tight greenspan 
said he claimed that sprinkel placed too much emphasis on the 
importance of monetary growth in foretelling future economic 
activity to have controlled the growth in the money supply to the 
extent that sprinkel advocates would have triggered an unduly 
inflationary environment last year greenspan testified 
there is a difference of opinion between mr sprinkel and 
myself on this issue it is an economists disagreement 
greenspan said 
the fed chief refused under questioning to make a prediction on 
the course of short and longterm interest rates during the coming 
year saying that for him to do so would be sheer 
mischievousness in light of the fact that the fed has direct 
influence over interest rates 
the fed predicted that the unemployment rate because of the 
more sluggishgrowth would not show any improvement holding at 
around 58 percent to 6 percent the unemployment rate currently is 
58 percent 
on inflation the fed predicted that consumer prices as 
measured by an inflation index tied to the gnp would rise 325 
percent to 375 percent this year a slightly better forecast than 
the administratin which is looking for a 39 percent rise in the 
gnp price deflator as the index is called 
greenspan also revealed the money growth targets the fed has set 
for 1988 these targets while covering a broad range serve as a 
policy guide for the central bank as it tries to supply enough 
money to keep the economy growing at a healthy rate while guarding 
against pumping out so much money that inflation is rekindled 
in one measure of the money supply m2 which includes checking 
deposits plus cash held by the pubic along with savings accounts 
and money market accounts the fed said it was aiming for growth of 
4 percent to 8 percent this was the same target set for a somewhat 
broader measure of money known as m3 
the central bank as it did last year decided to set no growth 
target for m1 the narrowest guage of money because of its 
erratic behavior in recent years 
the ranges for m2 and m3 were slightly lower than the 1987 
targets of 55 percent to 85 percent 
m2 actually grew much more slowly last year than the target 
increasing only 4 percent a fact that raised criticism inside the 
reagan administration from some officials who contended that the 
central bank was pursuig a tightmoney policy which was driving up 
interest rates and threatening a recession 
the presidents council of economic advisers issued a report on 
friday which said tight fed money policies were partly responsible 
for triggering the oct 19 stock market crash 
greenspan less than a month after succeeding volcker led the 
central bank to increase its discount rate from 55 percent to 6 
percent on sept 4 the action raising the rate the fed charges to 
make bank loans occurred as the value of the dollar was falling 
sharply and causing fears of higher domestic inflation

harlan b strong has seen his share 
of losers in his work for young america corp one of the nations 
largest handlers of sweepstakes rebates and product promotions 
but strong says its the winners who stand out especially when 
theyre as excited as a detroitarea woman he called to inform that 
she and her family had won a trip to disney world 
there was this long pause then all i could hear was this 
bloodcurdling scream said strong the companys vice president 
of sales 
the woman put down the receiver and strong said he could hear 
her running through the house yelling the good news to her family 
for several minutes before returning to continue their conversation 
i enjoyed that it was a real honest expression of joy at 
receiving this he said 
nationally there are about 40 companies in the fulfillment 
industry which takes its name from its work fulfilling rebate 
requests and product promotions and conducting sweepstakes 
young america corp is one of five fulfillment companies in 
minnesota and its closest national competitor the maple plain 
co is less than 20 miles away in maple plain 
this is kind of the mecca of the fulfillment business said 
strong 
the 17yearold young america corp has grown from 15 employees 
to more than 1000 thats nearly the population of this tiny town 
from which the company took its patrioticsounding name 40 miles 
west of minneapolis 
business became so brisk that the company had to acquire its own 
post office a few years ago to handle its up to 2 million pieces of 
mail a week ranging from consumers requests for duracell battery 
rebates to campbell soup bowls to sweepstakes entries 
the 180000squarefoot plant which is completing its fourth 
expansion in 10 years is highly automated and that often 
surprises visitors strong said 
in one room employees do nothing but feed envelopes into 
automatic slitting machines to open them 
i think people think there are folks sitting around the table 
opening envelopes strong said 
that impression was closer to the reality of the companys 
earlier days when strong recalls executives taking off their coats 
and joining workers in packaging watches to keep product promotions 
on schedule 
selecting winners from thousands of contest entries has grown 
more sophisticated too 
in the old days we used to dump them on the floor strong 
said 
now workers randomly select 2 percent to 10 percent of the 
entries received each day until the contest deadline and place them 
in numbered boxes after the contest deadline workers draw 
numbered pingpong balls from a lottery drum and then pick the 
winners from the corresponding numbered boxes of envelopes 
but the prizes tvs vcrs furs and jewelry and other goodies 
small enough to be stored at the plant are still kept locked in a 
carefully guarded storage area 
the privately held company which does not disclose its 
financial figures promotes its security when selling its services 
to its clients mostly fortune 500 companies by touting its 
computerized tracking of mail and products as they move through the 
company 
the company installed a paper shredder more than two years ago 
to destroy mailedin rebate forms after people began digging 
through landfills to retrieve other companies discarded ones 
strong said 
he is proud of the companys record of employee honesty young 
america corp has never had to discipline a worker for trying to 
influence contest drawings or stealing rebate forms strong said 
young america corp is the largest single employer in carver 
county a dairy farming area thats beginning to give way to the 
suburban sprawl of the twin cities many employees have been with 
the company for years and up to 20 people a day apply for jobs 
there 
if i left here to get a job with this kind of status and 
variety i would have to go to minneapolis said jan feltmann a 
senior client service representative who began working for the 
company 14 years ago a few hours a day at home 
i was a young mother and had a college loan to pay and i 
didnt want to have my husband pay for that said mrs feltmann 
35 
company officials were so impressed with her work that they 
brought her to the plant where she now supervises others 
about 600 employees are home checkers and home data entry 
personnel verifying customers entries rebates and order forms 
and typing the information for entry into the companys computer 
system which is capable of canceling multiple requests from the 
same household 
customer service where 30 people respond to incomplete rebate 
forms and handle requests for exchanges on product promotions also 
is a fastgrowing segment the employees answer tollfree numbers 
set up to handle customer inquiries a wholly owned telemarketing 
subsidiary young america direct in edina was formed last year and 
already employs about 100 people

a group of japanese gets off a bus chartered by 
hokubei tours inc to gaze at the statue of liberty but these far 
easterners are not mere picturetaking tourists theyre 
entrepreneurs who want to own a piece of america rather than just 
eyeball it 
hokubei whose most popular tour shuttles visitors to as many as 
five cities in pursuit of anything from a ski chalet to a factory 
to a wideopen prairie is just one company catering to the 
swelling ranks of small japanese investors interested in us 
property 
big cashrich corporations like mitsui fudosan inc which 
bought new yorks exxon building in 1986 have been the biggest 
players in the us market up to now and experts say theyll 
likely dominate the 4 billion to 10 billion in purchases expected 
this year 
but smaller investors also are making a mark quietly traveling 
the nation visiting with local business people and getting a feel 
for the landscape 
a recent study by cushman amp wakefield a major real estate 
company found that japanese institutional investors rate real 
estate as their most important investment in the united states 
well ahead of government bonds and corporate stock 
the new wave of japanese buyers is being drawn to this country 
by high returns and comparatively cheap property the average price 
per square foot for highquality office space in tokyo is 4000 
while office space of similar quality in new york commands 400 per 
square foot or less according to david shulman director of real 
estate research at salomon brothers inc 
lower interest rates and the dollars drop against the japanese 
yen make such bargains too good to pass up for many japanese 
investors who stand to reap yields three times higher than in 
their own country 
with their penchant for savings japanese who have amassed as 
little as 500000 are realizing they can own a luxury condominium 
in the united states and pay someone else to manage it more 
ambitious investors might join forces to buy a piece of commercial 
property 
what may be equally noteworthy is that they also are spreading 
out from maintier cities shulman said their interest no longer 
is exclusively focused on a handful of major urban areas 
at los angelesbased hokubei which specializes in promoting 
japaneseamerican business relationships research manager charles 
laub said the company arranged 30 real estate tours last year and 
expects to do as many this year if not more 
during the planning stages of a trip investors are asked what 
type of property they would like to see and in what geographic 
regions then laub makes the appropriate real estate contacts 
while others arrange for accommodations transportation and 
interpreters 
they wont just go to one city he said most want to see 
four or five cities typically he said investors spend five 
to seven days in new york then maybe theyll fly to chicago then 
down to dallas up to san francisco or los angeles the whole thing 
could be two or three weeks 
most often investors ask to see office buildings although there 
is increasing interest in upscale residences like singlefamily 
homes or condominiums valued at a minimum 500000 laub said 
when on tour its all business from monday to friday said 
laub who added that arrangements can be made if travelers want 
to go play golf or if theyre in new york and want to go to the 
empire state building some want to go to epcot center in florida 
many of the tours laub arranges are sponsored by big japanese 
institutions like mitsui bank and nomura securities which 
ultimately hope to serve as lenders if deals are consummated 
independent investors who usually travel in small groups must 
foot the 3000to6000 bill for a twoweek trip on their own 
on the first trip they like to get a feel for the area he 
said actual deals are negotiated on subsequent visits 
despite all the tours laub has arranged he has no idea how many 
have actually resulted in definite sales agreements they come in 
secretly to close on deals i dont know what is sold he said 
others also have discovered that real estate can be a common 
language when talking to the japanese 
earl bunker president of hori amp bunker inc of lincoln mass 
puts out newsletters in japanese that list us properties for 
sale while several property owners complain of a lack of response 
to the ads bunker insists that if he keeps on publishing hell 
penetrate the market 
translation is very important said bunker adding that the 
japanese expect the same preferential treatment theyve been 
giving us 
cecil ivey president of piping engineering co of sand springs 
okla said he has had some nibbles from japanese interested in the 
shuttered welding plant he is trying to sell in alamo texas 
although he advertised with bunker he said his contacts came from 
elsewhere 
much foreign interest has centered on southern texas where 
investors can cash in on the maquiladora concept in which 
companies set up manufacturing facilities in mexico to take 
advantage of cheap labor while maintaining office operations just 
miles away in the united states 
last year a full busload of japanese descended upon the 
southern part of the lone star state hitting every town on the 
border from laredo to brownsville said peter pranis who as 
vice president of economic development for the council for south 
texas economic progress played host when the group reached 
mcallen texas 
theyre like information vacuum cleaners he said theyre 
very courteous and wellmannered but theyve got a very good idea 
what theyre looking for they asked very pointed questions 
elsewhere a developer who asked not to be named said japanese 
are among those interested in a package of two buildings that 
comprise an entire block in baltimores prime business district 
even dean williams a retired salesman in las vegas nev spent 
a couple of hundred dollars on an ad to sell the 35 acres of land 
he owns in central nevada to the japanese at 69000 for the 
parcel he thinks its a bargain

the president of the nbc television network 
indicated nbc is unlikely to sell programming to turner 
broadcasting system incs proposed new cable network unless nbc 
owned a portion of the parent company 
last year nbc and tbs discussed the possibility of nbc taking 
part ownership of atlantabased tbs but the companies announced in 
midjanuary that the talks had been halted 
nbc president robert wright said monday the network would be 
interested in helping program the proposed turner network 
television only if it owned a piece of tbs 
we could be very interested in selling programming to it but 
i just dont see that happening wright said after speaking to a 
civic group in atlanta the problem with tnt is that it is very 
much involved in the organizational ownership issues that 
blocked nbcs attempt to buy an interest in tbs last year he added 
nbc reportedly had attempted for the second time in three years 
to purchase up to 25 percent of tbs for 400 million 
tbs is hoping to launch the new cable network in july tnt is 
proposed as a super cable channel that would compete with the 
networks by offering firstrun miniseries award shows and major 
sporting events

arthur emil never envisioned traveling all the 
way to japan to sell some of the 54 luxury condominiums he 
developed in lower manhattan 
and he was more than a little skeptical when japans fujisankei 
communications group approached him about featuring one of the 
units on a homeshopping broadcast that would air in tokyo osaka 
and nine other cities in late january 
a fujisankei representative explained that the communications 
giants satellite shopping network markets highticket items 
emil said they said they sold a chateau in france 
and what could be more highclass than his condos which range 
in price from 500000 to 17 million and feature such amenities 
as subzero refrigerators in the gourmet kitchens 17foot ceilings 
and a 24hour concierge in addition to the doorman 
emil had a hard time with the notion that someone would buy an 
apartment without physically visiting the property although he 
said it does happen from time to time 
but fujisankei promised after a single broadcast to present 
him with 20 to 25 qualified buyers im assuming these are real 
buyers he said shortly before leaving for japan in early 
february 
but 16000 miles later and one week later emil was a believer 
you can sell apartments in the united states by television in 
japan he exclaimed 
while emil said fujisankei introduced him to fewer qualified 
buyers than promised he was still pleased 
none of the investors signed on the dotted line but emil said 
several are coming to new york to see the landmark building in the 
near future and hes confident hell close on more than one deal 
emil described the buyers as wealthy executives who do business 
in and around new york and were attracted by the buildings luxury 
qualities 
i expected a number of offshore buyers but that i would 
schlep myself over to japan he joked 
fujisankeis january broadcast proved to be successful not only 
for emil a limousine used by pope john xxiii also sold to an 
unnamed bidder for 423000

japanese who invest in us real estate evoke 
mixed emotions on this continent angering americans competing to 
buy the same properties but pleasing sellers 
they have come into the market with a tremendous new source of 
capital and prices have gone up on the very small uppertier of 
properties theyre interested in said jon minikes a managing 
director at jones lang wootton usa an international real estate 
firm headquartered in new york 
among those uppertier properties are new yorks exxon 
building which was sold to mitsui fudosan for 610 million the 
arco towers in los angeles which sold for 620 million to shuwa 
investments corp and the equitable building in dallas for which 
nissei realty paid 250 million 
whenever more money is chasing a good product prices have to 
go up its very simple economics he said 
but americans who expected to pay less for quality commercial 
property in major cities are upset with the japanese said 
david shulman director of real estate research at salomon brothers 
inc while building sellers are very happy 
shulman estimated that prices for quality office buildings could 
drop by as much as 10 percent to 15 percent if the japanese ceased 
buying property or became less aggressive in their purchases 
japanese can afford to pay more because they are guaranteed to 
reap far greater yields in the united states than at home 
for example a 100 million investment in japan would probably 
yield 1 or 2 percent a year said jim montinari senior vice 
president of cushman amp wakefield a national commercial real estate 
firm yield is what investors earn after they subtract expenses 
from rent collected 
but the yield on the same 100 million investment in us real 
estate is certain to be 6 to 9 percent comparing oppportunity to 
japan versus the united states is anywhere from triple to more 
he said 
in japan highquality commercial real estate appreciated 
between 50 percent and 60 percent in price from 1985 to 1986 
shutting out potential investors from their domestic market and 
turning their attention to the united states where prices for 
comparable properties rose about 15 percent shulman said 
the fall in the value of the dollar against the yen also has 
lured japanese investors but a cheaper dollar can be a 
doubleedged sword minikes said 
most japanese investors are looking at the rise in value of 
the yen as a way to make the purchase cheaper but you realize that 
if the yen keeps rising their investment which is generating 
us dollars will show a lower yield he explained 
while some americans are miffed at the cashrich japanese 
companies that are snapping up top properties at top dollar real 
estate companies have adapted to serve a new market 
we constantly have groups coming through who want us to tell 
them about us real estate minikes said we regard them as a 
continuing source of profitable business

national westminster bank plc britains largest 
bank said tuesday its profit sank 301 percent last year mainly

countries and heavy losses at its investment bank 
the bank said its 1987 earnings totaled 429 million pounds or 
759 million down from 614 million pounds or 109 billion in 
1986 on a pershare basis that worked out to 57 pence or 1 per 
share in 1987 compared with 94 pence or 166 in 1986 
the bank said its provisions against loans to lesser developed 
countries including brazil mexico and other latin american 
countries now total 810 million pounds or 143 billion 33 
percent of its total exposure of 247 billion pounds or 437 
billion 
natwest raised its provisions against loans to lesser developed 
countries to 30 percent last summer and later by another 3 
percent to keep it within guidelines set up by the bank of england 
natwests international banking unit swung to a loss of 339 
million pounds or 600 million from a profit of 223 million 
pounds or 395 million because of the increased provisions and 
the lower dollar 
the groups investment banking division widened its loss to 116 
million pounds or 205 million last year from 38 million pounds 
or 67 million in 1986 natwest blamed continuing development costs 
and the effects of the october stock markets crash 
national westminster bank usa had a loss of 95 million pounds 
or 168 million after increasing its provision for loans to lesser 
developed countries to 35 percent that loss compared with a profit 
of 68 million pounds or 120 million in 1986

mcdonnell douglas corp shoved aside two 
competitors last year to reclaim the title of the nations largest 
defense contractor the pentagon said tuesday 
releasing its annual rating of the top 100 military contractors 
the pentagon said mcdonnell douglas had jumped past general 
dynamics corp and general electric co to win the top ranking for 
fiscal 1987 
the st louisbased mcdonnell douglas increased its pentagon 
work by 11 billion during the year to a new total of 77 
billion easily surpassing general dynamics 
general dynamics ranked no 1 in fiscal 1986 with 8 billion 
worth of contracts fell to no 2 in 1987 with work valued at 7 
billion general electric also suffered a decline in contract 
awards falling from the 68 billion it won in 1986 to 58 
billion in fiscal 1987 the pentagon said 
the defense department report covers the fiscal year ending last 
sept 30 and is considered the most definitive gauge of how major 
military contractors are faring each year 
the report discloses that the pentagons contractors were 
fighting over a smaller pie in fiscal 1987 with prime contracts 
totaling 1425 billion being parceled out that is 32 billion 
less than the total awarded in fiscal 1986 
moreover the top 100 companies as a group saw their share of 
those contracts decline slightly last year the 100 firms received 
954 billion of the contracts or 669 percent of the total 
compared to 986 billion and 677 percent in fiscal 1986 
according to the rankings there was only one company in the 
fiscal 1986 top 10 that failed to stay in that number last year 
rockwell international corp which is winding down its work on the 
new b1b bomber fell from fourth place on the 1986 list to 12th 
place in fiscal 1987 with contracts worth 22 billion 
rockwells spot in the top 10 was claimed by martin marietta 
corp which moved from 11th to seventh place in the rankings with 
work totaling 37 billion 
the other top 10 rankings involved the same companies as in 
1986 but in a different order 
the fourth largest defense contractor in 1987 was lockheed 
corp which won contracts totaling 56 billion it improved from 
sixth place the year before when its military business totaled 
49 billion 
fifth in the rankings was general motors corp with 41 
billion that was a decline from the 51 billion in work won by gm 
in 1986 but still enough to keep it at the same spot in the 
rankings 
rounding out the top 10 were raytheon co with 38 billion in 
contracts martin marietta with 37 billion united technologies 
corp with 36 billion boeing co with 35 billion and 
grumman corp with 34 billion 
mcdonnell douglas rise to the no 1 spot is nothing new for the 
giant aircraft maker while general dynamics was no 1 in 1986 
mcdonnell douglas was the topranked contractor in fiscal 1984 and 
fiscal 1985 
some of the companys larger contracts include the fa18 hornet 
fighter for the navy the f15 eagle for the air force the ah64 
apache helicopter gunship for the army and the av8b harrier jump 
jet for the marine corps

finance minister edouard balladur indicated monday 
he was opposed to the planned sale of the french financial 
newspaper les echos to pearson plc of britain saying he wont 
allow the transfer of ownership to proceed automatically 
in a statement balladur said the 886 million franc or 158 
million deal that was signed jan 11 between pearson and les echo 
owner jacqueline beytout is subject to the explicit authorization 
of the french authorities 
mrs beytout called the governments position exclusively 
political and the management of les echos said the newspaper 
wouldnt publish on tuesday in protest 
under regulations takeovers involving french companies and 
other european entities must be submitted for approval by the 
french treasury if no objection is raised after a twomonth 
period the transaction goes ahead automatically 
the ministry noted however that a 1986 press law stipulates 
that individuals or corporate entities that dont reside in the 
european community cant acquire a stake of more than 20 percent in 
the capital of a french publishing company without prior government 
approval 
the ministry said the european character of the pearson group 
doesnt appear to be durably established at this time 
ministry officials said the main stumbling block to the sale is 
the 205 percent stake in pearson held by media magnate rupert 
murdoch 
news corp murdochs australian press group disclosed jan 13 
that it had increased its stake in pearson by purchasing a 49 
percent block of shares from cerus sa the french investment arm of 
italian financier carlo de benedetti 
aides to balladur said the government is concerned that murdoch 
might be tempted to seek a controlling interest in pearson 
although murdoch has denied any such plans

the supreme court ruled unanimously tuesday 
that businesses may not be sued in federal court in certain cases 
involving their contributions to union benefit funds 
the court said the federal courts have no authority over cases 
in which companies refuse to contribute to multiemployer union 
benefit funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires 
in an 80 ruling in a case from california the court rejected 
reagan administration arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases 
could undermine the solvency of the multiemployer pension plans 
justice john paul stevens in his opinion for the court noted 
that in 1980 congress amended the employee retirement income 
security act erisa to provide a federal court remedy for trustees 
of the multiemployer benefit plans to collect delinquent 
contributions 
but stevens said the remedy does not extend to the employers 
statutory duty to make postcontract contributions while 
negotiations for a new contract are being conducted 
the federal courts have no authority to determine whether an 
employers refusal to contribute to the funds in such circumstances 
is a violation of the national labor relations act stevens said 
the case stems from a decision by advanced lightweight concrete 
company inc in california to withdraw from the union funds on june 
15 1983 when its collective bargaining agreement with its workers 
expired 
the fund managers filed a federal court suit in december that 
year seeking to force the company to pay into the pension plans 
for the period when the old contract expired until bargaining talks 
over a new contract reached an impasse 
the unions said erisa conferred such jurisdiction on the courts 
the suit was dismissed on grounds that the national labor 
relations board has final say the nlrb had ruled against the 
unions in november 1983 rejecting claims that advance lightweight 
failed to bargain in good faith 
todays decision upheld a 1985 ruling by the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the high court on 
thursday did not take part in the decision 
the case is welfare trust fund vs advanced lightweight 
concrete 852079 
in other cases tuesday involving business 
the court limited the job protection for government workers 
fired for lacking security clearances 
by a 53 vote the justices agreed with the reagan 
administration that the merit systems protection board lacks 
authority to decide whether the denial of security clearance is 
justified 
the court ruled against thomas e egan who was hired in 1981 as 
a laborer at the trident naval refit facility in bremerton wash 
on the condition he subsequently receive a security clearance 
the facility is used to test and repair trident submarines all 
jobs at the facility require security clearance 
the court in a victory for three midwestern states limited 
the secretary of the interiors authority to allocate water stored 
in missouri river basin reservoirs 
the justices ruled unanimously that the interior secretary 
exceeded his authority when in 1982 he approved a contract 
authorizing energy transportation systems inc etsi to take water 
from lake oahe in south dakota for a coal slurry pipeline project 
the decision is a victory for officials in missouri iowa and 
nebraska which had blocked the nowscrapped pipeline project 
north dakota south dakota and wyoming took the other side 
the court rejected claims by private landowners and ruled that 
the state of mississippi owns thousands of acres of oil and 
gasrich land near the states gulf coast 
by a 53 vote the justices said states may claim title to land 
beneath waters subject to the ties influence and not only land 
under navigable waters 
the ebb and flow of the tide not navigability determines the 
states ownership justice byron r white said for the court

italian financier carlo de benedetti 
and belgiums economics minister on tuesday called for a truce in 
the battle for control of societe generale de belgique sa the 
countrys biggest holding company 
representative shareholders have to sit down at the table to 
discuss clearcut principles an industrial plan the modalities of 
efficient management and a revitalization of the company de 
benedetti said in a statement 
de benedetti the largest independent stockholder claims to own 
43 percent of societe generales 282 million shares outstanding 
he has launched a bid for another 15 percent but the stock price 
has since exceeded his offer of about 4000 belgian francs 
societe generale hit a new record tuesday closing at 5350 
francs or 15280 up about 715 from monday 
de benedetti held meetings tuesday with several top government 
officials including minister of economy philippe maystadt 
caretaker prime minister wilfried martens and vicepremiers guy 
verhofstadt and philippe maystadt 
de benedetti wants to create a paneuropean holding company but 
the belgian government has maintained it wants societe generale to 
remain firmly anchored in belgium the 166yearold company 
controls about half of belgiums top 50 companies and has interests 
in more that 1200 companies worldwide 
as speculation mounts as to whether a brittle alliance of 
belgian and french financial groups could fend off de benedetti 
the italian financier called for a truce 
as the most important shareholder by a wide margin i want to 
make an appeal to reason de benedetti said there have been 
enough maneuvers in the corridors enough artificial coalitions 
enough unrealistic share counts enough projects inspired only on 
the basis of personal interest 
maystadt also said that it would be desirable that all 
concerned parties without exception at last sit down around the 
same table 
the french cie financiere de suez and about 18 belgian companies 
claim to hold more than 50 percent of societe generales shares 
but they have not officially agreed to form an alliance 
societe generale management has supported a francobelgian 
alliance

the british government said tuesday it would 
relinquish its golden share in britoil plc removing a major 
roadblock to british petroleum co plcs 44 billion acquisition 
of the north sea oil company 
since december bp has accumulated 798 percent of britoils 504 
million outstanding shares in a takeover bid priced at 25 billion 
pounds the oil giant has been paying 500 pence or 885 for each 
britoil share 
the government retained its special share which gives it a 
controlling vote over the companys affairs when it privatized 
britoil in two stages in 1985 and 1982 
the treasury said it would give up the share under certain 
conditions agreed to by bp 
britoil said its board of directors would meet to decide whether 
to abandon its resistance to bps offer 
britoils shares rose 177 cents to finish at 883 499 pence 
on the london stock exchange tuesday bps shares finished 
unchanged at 439 248 pence 
the government doesnt intend to exercise its special share as 
long as bp upholds promises to maintain headquarters for some of 
britoils operations in glasgow scotland and meet other 
conditions chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said in answer 
to questions in the house of commons 
scottish politicians had expressed concern that the takeover 
would mean the loss of jobs in scotland 
lawson said control of the golden share will eventually be 
transferred from the treasury to britains energy department where 
legal moves will be taken to terminate it 
an acceptable arrangement has been reached with bp lawson 
said i am quite sure there will be no backsliding by bp 
bp chairman peter walters said in a statement that the company 
was pleased that our discussions with the government have 
produced a successful resolution of the issues surrounding the 
special share 
we believe the outcome will enable us to manage the assets of 
britoil on a proper commercial basis in the interests of both our 
shareholders and the uk economy walters said 
but a britoil spokesman who asked not to be named said if 
you look at the statements by the government and bp youll see 
its a twoparty agreement between the chancellor and bp 
although britoil officials met with treasury officials 
concerning the governments use of the golden share the company 
wasnt a party to the agreement he said 
labor lawmaker john smith his partys treasury spokesman said 
in the house of commons that bp had gobbled up britoil and told 
lawson you have exacted precious little from bp in exchange for 
handing britoil to them on a plate 
atlantic richfield co of los angeles also had pursued britoil 
but abandoned its attempt and sold its 24 percent britoil holding 
to bp last month after bp sweetened its december offer of 797 
450 pence a share 
meanwhile the kuwaiti government through its londonbased 
investment vehicle the kuwait investment office has acquired a 
stake of more than 19 percent in bp over the last few months 
here are the conditions to which lawson said bp has agreed 
bp will locate both britoils and bps north sea exploration 
and production head offices in glasgow where britoil currently has 
its headquarters the office will control bps exploration and 
productio operations in norway and the republic of ireland as well 
as in britain 
britoil will be managed and operated as a separate independent 
subsidiary and will have its own chief executive 
the britoil board is to be headed by a nonexecutive chairman 
with no previous bp connections the appointment will be a joint 
agreement between bp and the government 
bp also agreed to try to achieve an increase of at least 5 
percent in recoverable reserves from britoils north sea oil fields 
bp will spend between 531 million and 575 million a year on 
exploration and development in areas controlled by bp and britoil 
a large increase over previous expenditures in the area

share prices closed higher in london tuesday but 
were down sharply from their best levels in concert with weak early 
trading on wall street 
trading volume picked up from its recent slack pace as some good 
institutional buying interest emerged dealers said 
the financial timesstock exchange 100share index finished at 
17579 107 points or 06 percent higher just 12 points above 
its lowest level for the day the index rose as much as 25 points 
in early trading bolstered by strong gains overnight in the new 
york and tokyo stock markets 
the strong tone was reinforced by news that britains real gross 
domestic product rose 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 1987 from 
the third quarter and was up 53 percent from a year earlier 
share prices showed little reaction to the gdp news but dealers 
said the figures should help sustain a cautious optimism among 
market participants 
dealers said another factor boosting the market was expectations 
that substantial tax cuts would be included in the budget to be 
presented next month by the thatcher government 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson said the government has 
agreed to give up its golden share in britoil plc clearing the way 
for the independent companys takeover by british petroleum co 
plc britoil shares rose 1 penny to 499 pence while bp was 
unchanged at 248 pence

grain and soybean futures prices closed 
moderately lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade 
wheat futures declined in reaction to the agriculture 
departments announcement late monday that it would replace its 
weekly auctions of surplus wheat with three weekly auctions 
beginning march 2 analysts said 
sales from the friday auctions have declined in recent weeks 
with last weeks total of 11 million bushels falling far short of 
the target of 25 million bushels 
the usda set initial targets of 10 million bushels for each of 
the three new auctions which will be held on tuesdays wednesdays 
and fridays 
traders fear that the new auctions could put as much as 30 
million additional bushels of wheat onto the open market which 
would tend to depress prices said jerry gidel an analyst for gh 
miller amp co 
soybean prices retreated in response to improved growing 
conditions for the south american soybean crop gidel said corn 
futures drifted lower due to a lack of fresh supportive news he 
said 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 317 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 3 cents lower with march at 196 a bushel oats were 1 cent 
lower to cent higher with march at 190 a bushel soybeans were 
3 cents to 8 cents lower with march at 620 a bushel

foreign ministers of the european 
economic community on monday formally adopted decisions taken at 
last weeks eec summit on limiting farm subsidies and overhauling 
the groups finances 
britain and the netherlands had made their acceptance of the 
summit agreement conditional on settlement of a relatively minor 
issue raised by france in the final stages of the feb 1112 
meeting 
officials said the french foreign minister jeanbernard 
raimond told mondays meeting that his government remained unhappy 
with proposals for placing new controls on eec subsidies to growers 
of such products as tobacco and wine 
but raimond said paris would allow the proposals to go forward 
without further debate that cleared the way for the foreign 
ministers to formally adopt the overall summit agreement 
by satisfying british and dutch demands for strict limits on 
farm spending the summit accords marked a breakthrough in the 
eecs budget crisis the 12nation group has been operating without 
a formal budget since the start of the year and faced possible 
bankruptcy by late summer 
eec budget ministers are scheduled to meet tuesday to adopt a 
draft 1988 budget the spending plan then must be approved by the 
european parliament 
hansdietrich genscher the west german foreign minister and 
chairman of mondays meeting told reporters that adoption of the 
summit agreement was an important step forward in the history of 
the european community 
genscher said he and chancellor helmut kohl told us officials 
during a visit to washington last week that the summit agreement 
will strengthen the economic vitality of europe by permitting 
faster removal of trade barriers between eec member countries and 
by giving more financial aid to the relatively poorer members in 
southern europe

the head of the securities and exchange 
commission said tuesday he did not expect congress to give the 
agency control of the stock index futures market and stressed the 
sec is working with futures regulators to prevent a recurrence of 
the october stock market crash 
sec chairman david s ruder also indicated his agency was 
examining ways of reducing volatility of stock prices and trading 
volume which he attributed partly to the use of margin in the 
stock index futures markets 
in a speech to an economic outlook conference sponsored by the 
conference board ruder repeated his agencys call to examine 
proposals for increasing coordination between the stock and futures 
markets and expanding the markets capacity to deal with 
unprecedented trading volumes 
trading strategies involving stock index futures representing 
baskets of actual stocks have been widely blamed for 
worsening market volatility and contributing to the severity of the 
oct 19 market crash 
ruder has contended the sec should have final regulatory power 
over all stockrelated instruments including the ability to 
overrule the commodity futures trading commission which now 
regulates such products 
in testimony to the senate banking committee earlier this month 
ruder asked for broad new powers over stockrelated futures 
trading such as increasing margin requirements and ordering 
temporary trading halts to help prevent a recurrence of the crash 
kalo hineman acting chairman of the commodities commission in 
subsequent testimony resisted the idea of putting the sec in charge 
of stock index futures trading 
during a news conference after tuesdays speech ruder defended 
his proposal but said he did not anticipate congressional support 
for sec authority over stock index futures markets 
he said that although he was not supporting a broad 
congressional revamping of the regulatory system the secs 
proposals would result in a more active and aggressive oversight 
of those markets by his agency 
that at times could entail pressuring the commodities commission 
to make market changes ruder said but he also said he expected 
any future regulation to stem from cooperative proposals and 
emphasized his agencys commitment to work closely with other 
regulators 
ruder said he and the sec staff had met with hineman and the 
staff of the commodities commission to discuss a wide range of 
marketrelated topics 
similar joint discussions were held with representatives of the 
stock and futures exchanges and would continue as the sec attempted 
to formulate concrete steps for preventing another crash ruder 
said 
in his speech ruder again called for higher margin requirements 
the down payment a buyer must make for trading stock index 
futures and for other measures to improve liquidity in the futures 
markets he said the sec would continue considering the 
effectiveness of delayed futures market openings 
ruder said the increased velocity and concentration of 
trading within the stock and futures markets and between those 
markets had increased the probability of wild price swings he said 
the increased intensity of trading was due partly to the lower 
margin levels in the futures markets 
initial margin on stock inedex futures for nonmarket makers 
should be raised at least temporarily to levels harmonious with 
stock margin levels applicable to stock market professionals he 
said

the stock market marked time today finishing 
narrowly mixed as its recent rally ran into some resistance 
analysts said the market had paused after a twoweek rally that 
had driven some major indicators to their highest levels in six 
weeks 
they said traders also appeared hesitant to make a major move 
while federal reserve chairman alan greenspan was outlining for a 
congressional panel the central banks monetary goals and his view 
of the economy 
the analysts found little in greenspans remarks to encourage 
them to bid stocks in either direction 
the stock market has benefited recently from indications that 
the economy may be stronger than had been expected leading some 
analysts to take an optimistic view of the outlook for corporate 
profits 
but there is plenty of uncertainty about the economys prospects 
in a new report today the government said orders to us 
factories for durable goods plunged 28 percent in january the 
biggest decline in a year 
but a decline had been expected in the wake of an unusually

officials at the nissan motor co plant 
in smyrna are recommending expanded production at the plant that 
could include a second passenger car line the company stated 
monday 
however the plant is not among the sites under consideration 
for a proposed joint venture with ford motor co to build a new 
vehicle company officials said 
nissan motor co announced that it would undertake a second 
phase of a study on the proposed joint venture and that a proposal 
would be made for top management review in may 
a study committee indicated a site had not been selected yet but 
the smyrna facility which makes light trucks and sentra cars was 
not among those being considered 
the joint venture project with ford is looking at building a 
type of vehicle that is very different from the cars and trucks we 
build at smyrna said jerry benefield president and chief 
executive officer of the smyrna plant 
but officials said plant production may be expanded anyhow 
because of a proposed addition of a second passenger car line and 
parts production may be increased 
benefield said he was recommending that the plant begin making 
three components sentra engines truck axles and front and rear 
bumpers for the sentra the new production would not require any 
new employees officials said 
the company also is considering adding a second passenger car 
line at the plant which would require a larger work force 
the companys board of directors will review the proposals at an 
april meeting

federal reserve chairman alan greenspans prediction of modest 
economic growth and continued low inflation received a sharp 
negative reaction on the precious metals futures markets tuesday 
on other markets which were not necessarily affected by 
greenspans comments prices for future delivery of livestock 
meat orange juice grains soybeans and stock indexes all 
retreated energy futures advanced 
analysts said greenspans 1988 economic forecast delivered in 
testimony before a house banking subcommittee in washington was 
viewed as a price depressant for precious metals which tend to 
perform well as investments during bad economic times 
the most important thing he said for the precious metals was 
that inflation is expected to be at a moderate rate of 325 percent 
to 375 percent for 1988 said bette raptopoulos an analyst for 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
peter cardillo commodity trading adviser for josephthal amp co 
in new york said precious metals futures also were pressured by 
the days lower prices for most other commodities reflected by a 
268point decline in the commodity research bureaus index of 21 
commodities 
among the precious metals platinum futures registered the 
sharpest drop falling 15 across the board at the new york 
mercantile exchange where the contract for april delivery settled 
at 44880 a troy ounce 
on new yorks commodity exchange gold settled 3 to 430 lower

cents lower with march at 630 a troy ounce 
some feeder cattle futures fell the daily limit of 150 cents a 
pound on the chicago mercantile exchange and other livestock and 
meat futures also posted steep losses 
cattle futures weakened in reaction to a variety of fundamental 
factors including relatively slack wholesale demand for beef 
products high retail prices for beef and good availability of 
slaughterready cattle said tom ohare an analyst for smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
a monthly agriculture department report showing the number of 
pork bellies in cold storage to be higher than the market had 
expected sent pork complex futures down sharply ohare said 
live cattle settled 70 cent to 123 cents lower with april at 
7177 cents a pound feeder cattle were 75 cent to 150 cents 
lower with march at 8102 cents a pound hogs were 10 cent to 77

were 1 cent to 185 cents lower with march at 5180 cents a pound 
frozen concentrated orange juice futures sank on the new york 
cotton exchange in reaction to a price cut of 25 a ton for 
brazilian juice analysts said 
cheaper brazilian orange juice could result in less demand for 
us juice 
orange juice settled 280 cents to 390 cents lower with march 
at 16335 a pound 
wheat futures prices declined on the chicago board of trade in 
reaction to the agriculture departments announcement late monday

choppy trading tuesday 
gold prices also fell republic national bank of new york quoted 
a late bid price for gold of 44150 a troy ounce down 275 from 
mondays late bid 
analysts said the dollar gained some strength from reports of 
congressional testimony by federal reserve board chairman alan 
greenspan early in the session reversing overnight losses 
john lynam an analyst at security pacific national bank said 
traders were encouraged by greenspans statement that he saw no 
signs of a recession 
other analysts in europe and the united states cited his comment 
that the us money supply might grow at a faster pace this year 
that spawned speculation that the fed might have to encourage 
higher interest rates to slow excessive money growth which would 
stimulate inflation 
in turn higher rates would make dollardenominated investments 
more attractive boosting demand for the us currency 
in the end however the dollar wound up mostly lower in trading 
described as choppy 
lynam said the market continued to be dominated by charts and 
technicals making people less willing to hold on to their 
positions 
the whole problem is that this has become a onerelease

chorek an analyst at the chicago office of market services inc

market becomes keyed off of technicals

a federal judge has issued a temporary 
injunction blocking eastman kodak cos deal to merge its 
photofinishing operations with those of fuqua industries inc and 
the company continues to face questions about its 51 billion 
acquisition of sterling drug inc 
kodak announced tuesday that it had been tendered more than 96 
percent of sterling shares during the offering period that expired 
monday and said it expected to complete the acquisition in a few 
days 
the company has scheduled a meeting with analysts thursday in 
new york in an effort to convince them of the merits of the 
sterling deal 
kodaks stock rose 50 cents a shre to 4125 a share tuesday in 
consolidated new york stock exchange trading fuquas stock fell 50 
cents a share to 2850 
in the fuqua dispute us district judge eldon mahon in fort 
worth texas issued his ruling monday in response to a suit filed 
in december by phototron corp a san bernardino calif wholesale 
photofinishing company 
the suit contended that if the proposed merger went through 
kodak and fuqua would control 50 percent of the wholesale 
photofinishing industry and 80 percent of the total market for 
photorelated paper and chemicals said brenda landry an analyst 
for morgan stanley and co 
the injunction will remain in effect pending a trial on the 
merits of the case 
fuqua spokeswoman donna browning in arguments supporting the 
merger said the merger would result in a new company controlling 
only 25 percent of the total photofinishing market in the united 
states 
the federal trade commission and the us department of justice 
antitrust division approved the proposed merger in december and 
said their investigation did not show any evidence that federal 
antitrust laws would be violated 
on dec 7 kodak announced plans to merge its wholesale 
photoprocessing laboratories with fuquas raleigh ncbased 
subsidiary colorcraft corp 
several financial analysts have lowered their opinions of kodak 
in recent weeks on grounds that the company overpaid for sterling 
obviously there are pros and cons to this said michael 
ellmann a stock analyst with wertheim schroeder amp co but i want

kraft inc will pay ambrit inc 85 million to 
settle a trademark battle over similar ice cream bars made by the 
two companies kraft announced tuesday 
the 6yearold case stemmed from krafts polar bar ice cream 
bars which ambrit contended were packaged in a manner that 
infringed on the trademark of its own klondike bar 
the supreme court last may let stand a lower court ruling 
prohibiting polar bar from using a wrapper resembling the klondike 
package and denying polar bar exclusive trademark rights to that 
name 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals had ruled in december 
1986 that polar bars may not have images of polar bears on their 
wrappers in imitation of the klondike design 
the appeals court also said polar bars may have the color royal 
blue on their silver foil wrappers only if it did not make them 
confusingly similar to the klondike wrapper 
the appeals court also had ordered a federal judge to determine 
what damages if any kraft must pay ambrit which is based in 
clearwater fla for imitating the klondike wrapper 
kraft said from its glenview ill headquarters that the 
settlement was significantly less than the amount sought by 
ambrit but declined to comment further citing agreements by both 
parties not to discuss specifics of the case 
the appeals court had canceled krafts polar bar trademark 
because the company had abandoned the name from 1932 when it 
stopped making a likenamed ice cream novelty until it began 
marketing a new ice cream bar in 1979

southdown inc a cement and energy company 
launched a 177 million cash tender offer tuesday for moore 
mccormack resources of stamford conn 
the offer is contingent on the valid tender of a majority of 
moore mccormacks common stock the inapplicability of delawares 
recently enacted antitakeover law the redemption or invalidation 
of moore mccormacks poison pill antitakeover defense and 
southdowns ability to secure 635 million in financing of which 
500 million has been committed by a major commercial bank 
tony doumlele director of corporate relations for moore 
mccormack said the tender offer was totally unsolicited 
on monday houstonbased southdown and its subsidiary sdw inc 
filed a federal lawsuit which seeks to overturn moore mccormacks 
antitakeover defenses including a poison pill provision that 
would make the acquisition prohibitively expensive 
the lawsuit claims that moore mccormack chairman paul r 
tregurtha tried to illegally block the tender offer 
southdown said in the suit that it will offer 31 a share for 
moore mccormack a building materials company with 57 million 
moore mccormack shares outstanding the transaction would be worth 
about 177 million 
southdown said in its suit that unless the antitakeover 
defenses are removed it will be deprived of the right to make a 
bona fide offer and will be subjected to confusion delay and 
lawsuits 
the suit said tregurtha and moore mccormacks board of directors 
violated their fiduciary responsibilities by setting up illegal 
obstacles that allegedly will prevent the companys shareholders 
from considering the tender offer 
the suit also said that merger talks between the two companies 
were initiated by moore mccormack a year ago and that tregurtha 
insisted that he hold the posts of chairman and chief executive 
officer in the combined business as a result southdown said it 
concluded that its only alternative was to take a proposal directly 
to the shareholders of moore mccormack 
southdown produces and sells cement and readymixed concrete and 
is in oil and gas exploration and development it announced monday 
that it has 1376 billion cubic feet of proved natural gas 
reserves up from 1117 billion cubic feet last year it attributed 
the increase to successful exploration in louisiana and texas 
moore mccormack produces building materials and is also involved 
in oil and gas exploration and production mainly in texas and 
louisiana 
no hearing has been set for the case assigned to us district 
judge lynn n hughes
