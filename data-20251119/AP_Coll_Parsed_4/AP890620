the alarms that have been sounding for months 
turned to a clamor over the weekend telling prime minister margaret 
thatcher that her revolution is in trouble 
strikes inflation and interest rates the economic diseases 
mrs thatcher has fought for 10 years to eradicate are haunting 
britain again and now comes a trouncing for her conservative party 
in european parliament elections 
the government while admitting its dismay insists this doesnt 
mean the end for mrs thatchers freemarket crusade it says voters 
always use elections to the european parliament to register protest 
against governments in midterm and that the turnout of 36 percent 
is too low to shape lasting judgments 
nonetheless the opposition labor party is jubilant having won 
its first national election victory since 1974 labor has emerged 
with 45 of the 78 mainland british constituencies and the tories 32 
fully overturning the 4532 advantage the tories held in the 1984 
euroelection 
labor having revamped some of its more stridently leftwing 
policies to broaden its appeal has been making steady progress 
since early this year said the partys foreign policy chief 
gerald kaufman 
i like the pace of it dont want to go too fast dont want a 
surge that can fall again before before britains next election 
which must be held by june 1992 he said 
on thursday labor won both seats in two special elections for 
vacancies in the house of commons in london and in glasgow 
scotland 
conservatives called both districts safe labor seats that the 
party should have won in the vauxhall district of london labors 
kate hoey increased the partys majority in glasgow central labor 
halted a challenge by the scottish national party and its candidate 
mike wilson won with a reduced but respectable majority 
former prime minister edward heath an outspoken thatcher foe in 
the conservative party believed she was in serious trouble saying 
if after 10 years of government youve still got nearly 2 
million unemployed youve got an overall deficit on your trade and 
other dealings of 15 billion pounds 23 billion youve got 
interest rates up to 14 percent and youve got inflation up to 83 
percent and rising then people are bound to say is this really 
what we want 
energy secretary cecil parkinson said we recognize all those 
things we agree that inflation is a great curse were tackling it 
and one isnt popular while one is serving up the medicine 
the inflation is widely ascribed to thatcherisms own success in 
reviving the economy through tax cuts deregulation selling 
nationalized industries abolishing foreign currency controls and 
curbing trade union rights 
the result has been a national spending spree a sharp increase 
in the trade deficit bigger wage demands and higher interest rates 
the unrest triggered by rising wage demands has raised the number 
of worker days lost to strikes from 38000 in december to 82000 in 
april wage increases are running at 93 percent compared with 75 
percent two years ago on wednesday britain faces its first 
national rail strike since 1982 
a wageinflation spiral would be a nightmare for any government 
but even more trouble awaits mrs thatcher over her plans to shake 
up the legal teaching and health services her widely unpopular 
property tax reform and her insistence on privatizing the national 
water and electricity industries 
voters may also have been put off by her combative stance toward 
the european economic community which she has portrayed as a 
bureaucracy bent on forcing socialism down the british throat 
i think the general public are fed up with eurobashing said 
heath 
despite thatcherisms difficulties no neutral observer is ready 
to write her off mrs thatcher has hit low patches before her 
supporters say yet she remains the only british prime minister in 
more than 160 years to win three consecutive elections 
strikes may be recurring but the number of days lost is nothing 
near the 30 million in the last year before she ousted labor in 
1979 inflation has yet to approach the doubledigit permanency of 
the years immediately before mrs thatchers ascent 
many voters seem to feel that having spent 10 years tackling 
britains real problems she is now attacking nonexistent demons 
on issues like health and water a widespread feeling prevails of 
if it aint broke dont fix it 
simon jenkins writing in the prothatcher sunday times said the 
eurovote and the surprising 15 percent share of the vote won by 
the environmentalist green party reflected a yearning for a 
community spirit that has suffered in the hardheaded enterprise 
culture favored by mrs thatcher 
everywhere he said voters were distressed by what they perceive 
as a deregulating spirit gone too far from the governments 
refusal to impose dog licenses to combat a wave of dog attacks to 
the ease with which entrepreneurs can knock down historic buildings 
and put up bland office blocks 
mrs thatcher he concluded must reconstruct latethatcherism 
and must do so urgently

about 3000 people cheered and surged 
onto the road outside the ondangwa refugee camp when buses carrying 
170 returning exiles finally arrived 
most wore the red blue and green colors of swapo the southwest 
africa peoples organization which fought for 23 years to win 
namibias independence from south africa in the rush to welcome the 
new arrivals few noticed a south african army truck convoy passing 
at that moment its drivers grimfaced as they threaded their way 
toward home 
the scene last week symbolizes the changes taking place in 
ovamboland namibias populous northern tier as the territory tries 
to put a 23year bush war behind it and move toward peace and 
independence 
the situation say local residents and frequent visitors has 
changed swiftly and dramatically since south africa agreed in 
december to a plan under which it will give up africas last colony 
which it has held for 74 years the deal also provides for 
unsupervised elections to set up a new government 
despite a flareup of border fighting that stalled the plan in 
april the south african military presence which once numbered 
50000 troops has been steadily cut to about 15000 with more 
leaving daily 
at the main military base in oshakati once known as white 
city scores of houses now stand empty and the only south african 
soldiers in evidence at the base are paratroopers manning the gate 
un officers occupy the former headquarters buildings 
by road and rail scores of armored vehicles used in the 
guerrilla war are being sent back to south africa others still 
caked with mud from jungle patrols line base parking lots 
among those requisitioned by un officials for use by their own 
forces are at least 10 casspirs vehicles in the hands of the hated 
koevet crowbar antiinsurgency police the hulking vehicles came 
to symbolize the harsh south african law enforcement polices 
repainted white with big un letters on the side the 
casspirs will be used by the un police monitors whose job is to 
watch and handle complaints about the conduct of the southwest 
african police of which koevoet is now a part 
the most stunning change say some residents and visitors is the 
sudden and omnipresent visibility of swapo after years of government 
suppression 
the nationalist movement considered likely to win a majority in 
the elections scheduled for november draws its largest support in 
this region of bushland farms and scattered settlements home to 
nearly half of namibias 14 million people 
although the internal political wing of swapo could legally 
operate while the guerrilla unit was outlawed this popular support 
remained largely hidden in the years of warfare even displaying the 
swapo flag often brought harassment and brutal south african 
treatment 
now the flag flutters openly from homes roadside liquor stores 
and garages even atop a concrete water tower near the angolan 
border where until a few weeks ago south african soldiers manned 
machine guns 
the exiles said by the united nations to number 41000 are 
returning to namibia aboard unchartered flights from neighboring 
countries to register for the november vote the first step toward 
setting up an independent government 
some observers say they have been surprised by the speed of the 
south african withdrawal and by the lack of visible bitterness on 
the part of the departing forces 
however a barely concealed resentment remains among many white 
residents of northern namibia about what is taking place 
especially the demonstrations in support of swapo which many 
believe is determined to impose a marxist regime if it wins the 
twothirds majority needed to control the new government in the 
november elections 
are you going to write the truth about this messup one 
germanspeaking resident asked a journalist at the base guest house 
reports persist in the community that the koevoet although 
officially integrated into the regular police still holds several 
swapo guerrillas as prisoners and continues to intimidate and 
brutalize swapo supporters in the countryside 
peter fitzgerald a dublin police superintendent who commands the 
un police monitoring contingent said he had been unable to pin 
down rumors about prisoners

while soviet citizens openly take their 
leaders to task and poles vote in free elections vietnams 
communists fire an editor who prints a short story about the human 
failings of an 18th century emperor 
vietnam the communist worlds third most populous nation with 
about 52 million people has set definite limits on free expression 
and political change while moving to liberalize its economy 
the list of taboos ranges from public criticism of top leaders 
and key policies to portraying the late revolutionary leader ho chi 
minh in anything but a heroic light 
in a recent interview deputy premier and foreign minister nguyen 
co thach said a multiparty system is out of the question in vietnam 
and said current economic reforms will prevent prodemocracy 
uprisings like the one in china 
we advocate broadening democracy and reaching a consensus 
through debate but we do not tolerate pluralism party chief 
nguyen van linh said in a speech in march 
linh and thach are key architects of doi moi or renovation 
vietnams version of soviet glasnost and perestroika doi moi 
flowered after linhs rise to power in late 1986 especially in 
southern vietnam where resentment of marxist rule is sharp and 
widespread 
journalists began to report on corruption and incompetence and 
their exposes got some highlevel officials fired books and 
magazines proliferated some challenging the tolerance of the 
political system others offering once forbidden sexual fare 
but about six months ago a backlash took shape either reformist 
leaders were trying to placate hardliners or the old guard simply 
felt things had gone too far 
western analysts say that rather than take the broader soviet 
road the vietnamese have opted for chinas give the people videos 
but no votes approach 
but unlike in china advocates of democracy have been mostly 
confined to debate rather than street action many have seized upon 
the firing of magazine editor nguyen ngoc last december as a cause 
celebre 
the editor of the relatively radical and popular literature and 
art was pressured to quit after publishing several short stories by 
a controversial writer nguyen huy thiep one depicted emperor quang 
trung a national hero who routed the chinese two centuries ago as 
a man of common foibles and frailties 
nguyen dinh thi secretary of the writers association said 
controversy within the 450member organization has been so fierce 
that people forgot politeness 
lai nguyen an a prominent literary critic described ngocs 
dismissal as a move by conservatives to deter doi moi 
skeptical books about our party socialism are not allowed 
those who tarnish national figures will be severely criticized he 
said in an interview 
nonetheless changes have been substantial 
more than a decade ago political prisoners abounded teenagers 
wearing jeans were suspect and foreign journalists were escorted to 
meet what some vietnamese disdainfully call ornamental 
intellectuals or government mouthpieces 
thach said recently that 94000 inmates of reeducation camps had 
been released over the past 10 years and only 120 political 
prisoners remained 
relations between state and religious groups have improved 
in february the government allowed a group of prominent 
academics critical of education standards to open vietnams first 
private university thang long university 
in the arts one recent film the woman of the river 
contrasts a decent exofficial of the fallen saigon government with 
a communist revolutionary who turns to corruption after the war 
although an antiwar novel has yet to appear the experiences of 
the vietnam war and other conflicts are handled with more human 
feeling in some recent fiction 
le huus forthcoming novel the humorless colonel tells of a 
young officer who dies in cambodia because of his fathers unbending 
military attitudes in the past war novels invariably depicted 
cardboard characters going cheerfully to their deaths for the 
communist cause 
while more strident voices are heard in the south artists and 
intellectuls in the north do not appear intent on hurtling doi moi 
forward or dismantling the socialist state 
writers and artists must be given more freedom but liberty 
doesnt mean destroying all gains of the past huu said writers 
should not be disruptive 
western diplomats also point out that while many students are 
disgruntled an organized prodemocracy movement among them does 
not appear to exist neither has an institution like the catholic 
church in poland emerged around which opponents to the existing 
order could rally 
said one envoy in the vietnamese capital i dont want to make 
any predictions but i dont think the communist party here will be 
challenged in the streets for several years as in china

it took a freespending entrepreneur to 
deprive solidarity of a clean sweep of the east blocs first freely 
elected legislative chamber a communistbacked businessman 
henryk stoklosa who has made millions processing dead animals 
edged out piotr baumgart an activist of the independent farmers 
union rural solidarity in sundays runoff unofficial returns 
showed monday 
stoklosa had drawn the communist coalitions biggest preelection 
crowd 50000 people at pila stadium for free sausages and beer and 
a drawing with prizes including a tractor a color television and a 
videocassette recorder 
tickets for the drawing had been handed out free in the 
provinces myriad small agricultural villages beforehand 
stoklosa will be a minority of one in the new 100member senate 
that is to convene next month along with the more powerful lower 
house or sejm which the ruling communists dominate because 
opposition candidates were only allowed to run for onethird of its 
seats 
a visit to pila on sunday gave some hint of stoklosas assets 
on the streets of the 70000resident western provincial town 
unusually prosperous and tidylooking by polish standards 
soldiers from nearby military bases strolled arminarm with 
girlfriends eating ice cream cones 
stoklosas moustachioed face stared out at passersby from 
election posters plastered nearly everywhere in store windows 
walls and road overpasses there were also posters attacking 
baumgart as an interloper because he comes from szczecin about 90 
miles away 
a journalist for solidaritys election gazette estimated stoklosa 
put 200 million zlotys 235000 into the campaign it was believed 
to be the most expensive political campaign ever launched for an 
individual in postwar poland 
in the nearby town of smilowo where stoklosas farmutil company 
is headquartered the polling station was doing a brisk business 
sunday in an apparent show of local pride in the towns favorite son 
but stoklosa himself was absent attending to business first he 
was at an international trade fair in poznan 
his farmutil company located on 345 acres at the end of a 
specially built road in smilowo gives a shiny neat appearance 
but it belches an obnoxious odor over the rolling landscape as 
dead farm animals and meat plant scraps are boiled down into fats 
and fodders for delivery by stoklosas truck fleet to customers 
around poland 
an employee speaking as flies buzzed around said the stench 
would disappear as soon as a new hermetically sealed processing 
system is completed 
the 210worker plant has sprung up in the past seven years 
stoklosa left his job as pila tourism director and was kicked out of 
the communist party during solidaritys 198081 heyday for alleged 
mismanagement 
the plant now produces mainly fodder for animals but plans are 
for it to expand into poultry raising fertilizer production and 
slaughtering 
the company makes an estimated 3 billion zlotys 35 million 
annually and published reports say stoklosa as a result can tool 
around town in either one of two new mercedes 
hes got everything he could want in life and now he wants 
other people to have more too said henryk mocho a stoklosa 
campaign worker 
he has very good organizing ability he is the man who started 
this whole enterprise from nothing and now people can make a good 
living here 
marian malecki of the pila solidarity citizens committee passed 
sunday afternoon quietly at the oppositions empty campaign office 
with leszek woznicki his former jailmate from 1982 the year 
thousands of solidarity activists spent time in jail after 
authorities crushed their movement 
they anticipated stoklosas win but treated it philosophically 
we are aware that poland does not begin and end at pila 
malecki said no matter what the outcome the local committee would 
share in solidaritys great success because it elected one other 
senate candidate and two members to the sejm from the city he said 
wozniaki a solidarity activist at the towns largest industry a 
lightbulb factory said his forces were outgunned by stoklosas 
massive poster campaign and westernstyle gimmicks 
he blamed a lack of money paper and printing machines and 
suggested polishamericans send more material aid to solidarity next 
time 
tell them that a free poland depends on them too he said 
only halfjokingly

after an 11year hiatus pianist van cliburn 
resumed his public performances monday night to thunderous applause 
with a concert dedicated to two late friends 
the audience called the pianist back to the stage 13 times after 
he completed his program of liszts piano concerto no 1 and 
tchaikovskys piano concerto no 1 cliburn ended the evening with 
four encores 
this is a very sentimental evening for me clibuurn told the 
audience before the performance this is an evening of remembrance 
of two wonderful friends 
the pianist dedicated the concert at the openair mann music 
center to eugene ormandy and fredric r mann 
ormandy who died in 1985 was music director of the philadelphia 
orchestra for 44 years mann a former us ambassador headed the 
summer concert festival at the music center from 1949 until his 
death in 1987 
cliburn played with ormandy and the philadelphia musicians within 
weeks of gaining world fame for winning the first tchaikovsky 
international competition in 1958 the relationship yielded numerous 
concerts and recordings 
he also played in philadelphia in 1978 the year he quit 
performed publicly weary from a schedule that included 100 concerts 
a year 
he said he chose the liszt to honor ormandys hungarian 
background the program concluded with tchaikovskys piano concerto 
no 1 
cliburn spent the morning practicing with the orchestra and the 
afternoon shopping in philadelphia 
its so good to be back with the philadelphia orchestra it 
seems like i never left cliburn said after the practice session 
among his favorite venues cliburn always listed manns theater 
in fairmont park where he would often play to the audience long 
after the orchestra musicians had left for the night 
proceeds from monday nights concert will help finance the 
orchestras free summer series which ormandy and mann began 
roland condon of princess anne md who traveled with cliburn 
for six months two decades ago for a film project said the years 
dropped away from the pianist in profile 
you would never know it has been 11 years since he appeared 
before an audience like this condon said 
since 1978 he had performed in public only twice in december 
1987 and in january 1988 for private gatherings honoring 
respectively soviet leader mikhail gorbachev and the bob hope

after years of absence mountain goats will 
be returned to the steep slopes of mount juneau with the help of 
tranquilizers helicopters and thousands of dollars in donations 
volunteers plan to relocate at least 10 wild goats from a remote 
site south of juneau or the olympic peninsula of washington in late 
summer or early fall 
the goal is to restore a herd of goats that can be viewed by 
residents and tourists in downtown juneau which sits in the narrow 
valley between mount juneau and mount roberts 
if all goes well in a year or two or five well have a 
population that will create splinter groups to proliferate in 
valleys from taku inlet to berners bay said project coordinator 
joel bennett a member of the state fish and game board 
mount juneau used to be goat habitat bennett said monday 
goats were there quite commonly back in the mining days the early 
days of juneau 
however overhunting led to the goats disappearance near the 
southeast alaska city although goat hunting has been banned in the 
area for several years the goats have never returned 
since the juneau audubon society began soliciting money for the 
project in february it has collected about 9500 in money and 
services enough to start the project bennett said 
bennett hopes to have 12000 by the time the relocation begins 
and said he has been encouraged by the public response donations 
have included helicopter time from a local charter outfit a 1000 
check and 30 worth of quarters that a little girl collected in a 
bag 
if the goats cannot be captured south of juneau near whiting 
river the volunteers will turn to the olympic peninsula where the 
goat population has become a nuisance 
we actally gave the goats to the olympic peninsula in the first 
place we would be getting the same stock back bennett said 
state wildlife officials will tranquilize the goats which will 
be transported to the mountain by helicopters officials hope to get 
at least three males and seven females to ensure that the population 
grows 
radio collars will be put on some of the goats so their movement 
can be monitored

faced with losing several years ago when the snow was nearly gone 
days before his target date stroud sent his two sons up the 
mountain to stretch white sheets on the ground sheets can look a 
lot like snow from 10 miles away but someone picked them up early 
and stroud lost 
another year stroud was ready to collect a free meal because a 
tiny patch of snow was visible the afternoon before the day of 
reckoning but the next day the mountain looked bare as it turned

the nations private employers now have 
expanded authority to require drug tests of job applicants while 
railroads and airlines have greater power to test those already on 
the job 
the national labor relations board says private employers may 
decide unilaterally to require drug testing of job applicants 
although they still must negotiate with unions if they want to test 
their employees 
the boards decision came monday the same day the supreme court 
ruled in a more narrowly defined case that railroads may require 
tests for workers without first bargaining with unions 
the decisions regarding existing workers appeared at odds but 
they involved two separate labor laws the railway labor act that 
applies only to rail and airline workers and the national labor 
relations act which governs other labor contracts 
the court case a victory for conrail followed earlier rulings 
in which railroads and airlines won the right to test workers for 
drug and alcohol use principally on grounds of concern for public 
safety 
the nlrb case covers far more industries one attorney involved 
with the nlrb decision said he expected it to lead to a 
proliferation of job applicant testing requirements 
people who had been taking a sitbackandwait approach may now 
go ahead with preemployment screening said john dennison vice 
president for labor relations for the star tribune newspaper of 
minneapolis theres been a lot of interest weve had a lot of 
inquiries 
labor department figures show that about 1105 million union 
members worked in the private sector last year along with 11 
million workers who are not members of unions but whose jobs are 
covered by union contracts 
a department study released in january said that just 3 percent 
of the nations privatesector employers had drugtesting programs 
although 43 percent of businesses with 1000 or more workers had 
testing programs 
the newspaper guild had challenged the star tribunes policy of 
testing job applicants for drug and alcohol use without first 
seeking to negotiate such a policy with the union 
an administrative law judge sided with the guild in 1987 but the 
nlrb overturned the part of the judges decision relating to 
preemployment testing 
since applicants for unionrepresented jobs at the newspaper were 
not yet members of the union we find that drug and alcohol 
testing of applicants for employment is not a mandatory subject of 
bargaining the board said 
it did however uphold a portion of the judges decision 
requiring the newspaper to provide the union with the names and 
addresses of applicants who were offered jobs but did not take them 
including those who refused to submit to testing 
the board said the guild was entitled to the information to 
monitor star tribune hiring practices for any signs of 
discrimination 
the union as part of its challenge of the policy said male 
applicants were allowed to provide urine samples without being 
observed while female applicants were required to give the samples 
partially unclothed and in the presence of a nurse 
the supreme court case involved conrails 1987 decision to check 
for drugs as part of a urinalysis administered to workers 
periodically and when they return to work after absences the tests 
were adopted in 1976 but prior to 1987 were used only to check for 
health problems such as diabetes 
railway unions said adding the drug test was a major 
labormanagement dispute under the federal railway labor act and 
therefore was a bargaining issue minor disputes may be settled by 
the railroad without negotiations with the union although any 
decision is subject to arbitration 
conrails wellestablished recognition of the relevance of drug 
use to medical fitness substantially weakens the unions claim that 
conrail now for the first time is engaging in medical testing that 
reveals facts about employees private offduty conduct justice 
harry a blackmun said in writing for the court 
lawrence mann a lawyer who represented the railroad unions said 
he hopes congress will act to protect workers rights by assuring 
drug tests are reliable and accurate 
in another drugtesting case the nlrb ruled monday that a 
california company violated labor law when it decided in 1986 to 
require all employees who were injured on the job and required 
treatment to submit to tests 
the johnson bateman co a manufacturer of concrete pipes 
contended that a management rights clause in its contract with 
the machinists union allowed it to implement the policy 
but the board siding with the union said there was no evidence 
that drug testing was among the issues covered by the clause which 
allowed the company to make certain work rule changes 
the instant drugalcohol testing requirement is a mandatory 
subject of bargaining the board said 
company officials were not available for comment monday 
according to a receptionist in their office and the companys 
lawyer also was not at his office monday afternoon

congress should step in to protect the privacy 
rights of workers who face drug testing as the supreme court expands 
some employers authority to require such tests a union lawyer says 
lawrence mann an attorney who represented railway workers in a 
case the high court decided monday said he hopes congress will help 
workers by assuring drug tests are reliable and accurate 
thats really what labor is concerned about he said 
mann said in the long run federal legislation could be more 
significant than mondays ruling in determining how drug tests will 
be conducted 
donald savelson a new york city lawyer whose firm represents 
airlines said the ruling is unlikely to have much impact beyond the 
railroad and airline industries 
collective bargaining will still be required before most 
employers can adopt drug tests he said 
the justices in their first decision focusing on drug testing in 
private employment ruled 72 that railroads that already require 
physical examinations for workers may require drug tests as well 
without bargaining with unions over the issue 
the court said conrail the consolidated rail corp acted 
legally when it unilaterally decided to use urinalysis tests to 
check for drugs 
the court based its ruling on an interpretation of the federal 
railway labor act that law applies to airlines as well but the 
ruling may have limited impact for other industries covered by 
separate federal legislation 
the justices in two key decisions last march said workers in 
sensitive government jobs or entrusted with public safety in 
federally regulated work may be forced to undergo the tests 
conrail decided in 1987 to check for drugs as part of a 
urinalysis administered to workers periodically and when they return 
to work after absences 
the tests were adopted originally when conrail was formed in 
1976 but their primary purpose before 1987 was to check for 
physical fitness not the presence of drugs for example the tests 
would reveal whether an employee had diabetes or other health 
problems 
railway labor unions said adding the drugscreening component is 
a major labormanagement dispute under the railway labor act 
and therefore must be submitted to unionmanagement negotiations 
minor disputes can be settled unilaterally by the railroad 
although any such decision by an employer is subject to arbitration 
justice harry a blackmun writing for the court said the 
drugscreening change is minor because the action is arguably 
justified by the terms of the parties collective bargaining 
agreement 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented 
mondays decision overturned a ruling by the philadelphiabased 
3rd us circuit court of appeals that barred conrail from 
conducting the tests without evidence that particular workers 
engaged in drug abuse 
the railroads said the need for drug testing is underscored by an 
accident at chase md on jan 4 1987 in which an amtrak passenger 
train collided with conrail locomotives killing 16 and injuring 
174 the conrail engineer and brakeman later were found to have been 
using marijuana 
the railroads also cited studies that estimated 25 percent of 
railroad workers drink alcohol on duty the studies said between 
1975 and 1985 alcohol and other drugs were responsible for 37 
deaths 80 injuries and 34 million in property damage 
in other action the court 
refused to reinstate former maryland gov marvin mandels 1977 
mailfraud conviction thrown out five years after he completed a 
prison term 
refused to kill a nineyearold lawsuit in which the catawba 
indian tribe claims ownership of 225 square miles of south carolina 
rejected an appeal by a california woman facing criminal charges 
in an attempted faithhealing of her fouryearold daughter who died 
of meningitis 
struck down by a 63 vote a connecticut law aimed at assuring 
that beer sold in the state costs no more than it does in three

navy secretary h lawrence garrett iii says a 
cruisemissile engine agreement with a michigan company will be 
canceled even though the navy found the deal led to lower prices 
the navy will cancel the agreement with williams international of 
walled lake mich on grounds that it should not have committed the 
service to future contracts garrett wrote last week to sen carl 
levin dmich 
for each of the past 10 years williams has submitted 
competitive prices well below those of its competitor for production 
engines garrett wrote we do believe that the fact of 
competition has benefited the taxpayer by creating an added 
incentive to lower prices 
he said williams has exceeded its reliability goals and delivered 
every engine ahead of the contract date 
williams in 1978 signed an agreement that would allow a 
competitor teledyne industries inc to use williams technology to 
build cruisemissile engines for the navy in return the navy 
guaranteed it would buy 240 engines a year from williams plus 25 
percent of any additional purchases up to 1200 engines annually 
garrett in an april letter to levin had written that the 
decadeold agreement with williams was severely limiting our 
contracting options and decisions in a manner which we believe 
inconsistent with sound procurement policy and the public interest 
garrett also said in april that teledynes prices had become 
very competitive with williams beginning last year 
the april letter was made public by a whistleblower group called 
the project on military procurement levin released last weeks 
letter 
garrett said the navys cancellation of the 1978 agreement in 
no way implies criticism of williams internationals integrity or 
performance 
we appreciate the emphasis on ethics that has always been part 
of williams internationals management and we consider it an 
outstanding navy contractor garrett wrote 
navy spokesman lt bruce cole said monday he could not 
immediately comment on the two letters 
levin said that even though the agreement was still being 
canceled there are some real differences between garretts 
april letter and what he wrote last week maybe he recognizes that 
his first letter was really not the most accurate reflection of the 
situation

the odds were heavily against richard gephardt 
when he sought the white house now hes on another track and the 
odds are on his side one day the new leader of the house 
democratic majority can almost certainly become the 50th speaker of 
the house 
as his partys floor leader he is in the job that has produced 
the last 12 speakers rep thomas s foleys promotion from majority 
leader to speaker two weeks ago opened the leadership spot for 
gephardt to win 
its not the white house but its not bad work 
and of course gephardts options are open 
hes ruled out a presidential bid in 1992 but at 48 hes got 
plenty of time to change political goals again with a 258175 
majority over the republicans in an era when incumbents seldom 
lose the democrats are likely to be electing speakers for quite a 
while 
gephardt and foley who begins his speakership at 60 give the 
democrats a newlook team that blends the getalong skill of the 
legislative insider with the political savvy of the national 
campaigner and gephardt was known as an able congressional 
politician before he tried to go national 
third man in the leadership is the new democratic whip rep 
william h gray iii of pennsylvania gray the first black to win a 
top leadership post proved able and adept as chairman of the house 
budget committee where he held what had been a wavering democratic 
line against the lure of reaganomics 
gephardt turned aside questions about his future presidential 
ambitions by saying the voters made that call for him in 1988 but 
he clearly had been planning another bid for the white house in 1992 
until the swift and unforeseeable shakeup that opened his path to 
the leadership 
that came when rep tony coelho of california the democratic 
whip announced that he was resigning rather thn undergo an ethics 
investigation into a 1986 junk bonds deal he was in line to succeed 
foley as majority leader with the resignation of speaker jim wright 
coelho left the house on thursday his 47th birthday 
a few weeks earlier gephardt had mused aloud about the personal 
and financial demands of another bid for the presidential 
nomination saying he had not decided whether to take them on in 
advance of 1992 he said he knew that would require him to get 
started soon and he didnt like that idea 
the question he said then was whether he could effectively 
pursue his policy goals in congress now as majority leader he 
intends to 
gephardt said after winning the leaders job that he agreed with 
speaker foley on the priority agenda including ethics and campaign 
reform then he turned to the economic issues that were the themes 
of his 1988 campaign 
in my humble opinion america is beginning to be in a state of 
decline said gephardt who pressed issues of trade and 
productivity during his presidential run and we as democrats have 
to lead even though the presidency is held by a different party 
and even though getting our consensus together on the democratic 
side is always difficult to do 
gephardt entered the democratic presidential field as an early 
advocate of tax reform and a champion of protectionist trade 
legislation its your fight too was his message to the voters 
the seasoning he gained and the scrutiny he faced as a 
presidential candidate will serve gephardt well in his new role 
like senate republican leader bob dole who ran twice for the white 
house he knows the techniques of national politics better than 
colleagues who have done all their campaigning in home districts or 
congressional cloakrooms 
both he and dole won the iowa caucuses the leadoff events of the 
1988 campaign then foundered and were finished by the march 8 super 
tuesday primaries gephardt quit in time to file for reelection to 
the house from his st louis district saying hed done his best 
made his mistakes and had no complaints or alibis 
gephardt faced sharp challenges in 1988 campaign debates for 
changing his positions over the years on such issues as a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortion on school busing on 
reaganomics he said change was evidence of growth of seeking 
better ways to do things that explanation plays better in the 
congressional world of compromise and consensus than in the 
presidential campaign arena 
now hes tried both and says he is not going to use the house 
leadership as a stepping stone to anything else you cant be an 
effective majority leader and be running for president he said 
as for the odds 
the last sitting house member to vault directly to the white 
house was rep james a garfield in 1880 
not since 1919 has the house majority elected a speaker who did 
not serve first as his partys floor leader

wind erosion over the winter inflicted its 
worst damage in three decades on the great plains ripping away 
topsoil over 143 million acres the agriculture department says 
the big reason for the increase is the drought soil 
conservation service chief wilson scaling said monday not only 
was it dry but it meant we went into the wind erosion season with 
inadequate vegetative cover and little residue to protect the soil 
from blowing 
he said the last time the maynovember wind erosion season 
wrought so much damage on the great plains was when 15 million acres 
were damaged in 195455 when the department first began to keep 
such records 
in the worst day of the season winds of up to 80 miles an hour 
swooped through on kansas on march 14 damaging 48 million acres 
kansas was the hardest hit state with more than 5 million acres 
damaged it was a record for the state north dakota was second with 
23 million acres harmed and texas followed with almost 2 million 
acres damaged 
more than 90 percent of the damage is on lands being used for 
crops the rest is on rangeland 
wind erosion damage last year uprooted soil from some 12 million 
acres 
the department said farmers used emergency tillage on 3 million 
acres a system under which topsoil with sufficient moiture is 
roughened to prevent blowing more than half of the emergency 
tillage was in texas 
here is a list of the amount of acres damaged in each great 
plains state 
montana 1832000 nebraska 191600 north dakota 2297700 
south dakota 678600 wyoming 552700 colorado 1403700 kansas

wheat production in the united states and 
europe should fall slightly below previous estimates for the next 
year suggesting supplies already reduced by last years drought 
will remain tight the usda says 
with world stocks already at their lowest in more than a decade 
prices could be somewhat skittish in the crop year that began june 
1 responding sharply to changes in growing conditions and import 
demand the department said 
a drop of 10 a ton in the price of us wheat in recent weeks 
represents an example of this sensitivity the agriculture 
department said in its monthly world grain situation and outlook 
report 
despite such fluctuations however prices should remain strong 
on the whole the department said it said the overall strength in 
prices combined with an improvement in crop prospects in some of the 
traditional importing countries is expected to reduce world demand 
from the level of a year earlier 
the usda said the major change will come in the soviet union 
where wheat imports are expected to decline by around 20 percent to 
12 million tons 
estimated exports by the european community remain the same as 
previously but the forecast of production has been lowered to 
reflect a smaller than expected crop of durum the wheat used for 
pasta the report said that might mean increased ec imports of north 
american durum and might even trigger a cutback in italian semolina 
exports to north africa 
the european community estimate was for 778 million metric tons 
down from 785 million last month 
the estimate of us production was 552 million down from 558 
million in last months report

parrot lovers and other buyers of exotic birds 
are getting a stern warning from the department of agriculture to 
make certain their pets meet federal import requirements 
the warning has been brought on by an outbreak of exotic 
newcastle disease among 17 amazon parrots sun cockatoos and other 
birds owned by a connecticut collector seven of the parrots were 
purchased from a houston dealer on may 19 and became ill they and 
12 other birds were dead by june 14 
meanwhile the collector had sold some of the birds to five pet 
stores and a number of individual purchasers 
the birds were tested by the national veterinary services 
laboratories in ames iowa operated by usdas animal and plant 
health inspection service they were found to have exotic newcastle 
disease 
to prevent further spread of the disease the collectors 60 
remaining birds were destroyed the department said it said it will 
pay the collector more than 45000 in indemnities for the 
destruction of his collection 
exotic newcastle disease is a virus that is deadly to all birds 
and could be a major problem for the commercial poultry industry 
although no commercial flocks have been infected yet 
larry b slagle acting director of the inspection service said 
smuggled birds enter the united states by the hundreds following the 
winter breeding season and often carry exotic newcastle disease 
without showing symptoms 
he said exotic birds imported into the united states must be 
declared to federal inspectors carry appropriate permits and enter 
a mimimum 30day quarantine the agriculture department tests them 
for disease during that time

president bush drawing a lesson for americas 
youth from the struggles of chinas students in tiananmen square is 
urging young people to devote their lives to democratic ideals and 
community service 
bush was honoring 121 of the nations top high school seniors 
the 1989 presidential scholars at the white house today after 
making a quick journey by helicopter monday evening to deliver a 
commencement address at cheltenham high school in wyncote pa 
there in a steamy gymnasium packed with 2500 people he 
delivered a message intended for all 25 million seniors graduating 
from high school this june not just cheltenhams 331 
we do not have to stand in front of tanks in america thank 
god but we do have to summon the same courage to confront the evil 
that exists in the world said bush 
he told the cheltenham graduates they were the heirs to a legacy 
of american sacrifice from bunker hill to bastogne where we 
upheld the tenets of democracy and from the red cross to the 
peace corps 
today i ask you to take a risk for a cause larger than 
ourselves he said it is the cause of helping others and 
thereby america it is the cause of democratic ideals 
he said brave people are struggling in the soviet union poland 
and china for basic human rights and freedoms that our ancesors 
secured for us and that we too often take for granted 
recalling the solitary young man who briefly stopped a column of 
tanks in beijing on june 5 bush said that vivid unforgettable 
image illustrates how precious is the freedom that is americas 
secret weapon and her shield 
he called volunteerism and community service central to our 
fabric as a nation and as a people no they arent as dramatic as 
the profiles in courage of warsaw the gulags and tiananmen square 
but they reflect the same sense of sacrifice and of concern 
for country decency our fellow man he said 
bush plans to keep the spotlight on youth and altruism on 
wednesday at the white house when he announces details of the yes 
to america initiative the acronym stands for youth entering 
service 
we will refute those who speak of a me generation instead 
this program can build a cathedral of the spirit and help yours 
become a global we generation he told the seniors 
bush has previously announced plans to ask congress to invest 
100 million over four years into a yes foundation to encourage 
young people to perform community service he will head the 
foundation 
bush was introduced at cheltenham by hang nguyen a senior 
graduating with top honors who came to this country as a refugee 
from her native vietnam in 1975 her mother still lives there 
each of us has come to this moment in a different way she 
said our commencement is both a common achievement and a unique 
one in some ways these ceremonies are like thousands of others 
being held across the nation 
but she added they were also unique because of this class 
this school this community and the commencement speaker 
the 330 cheltenham seniors had to yield some graduation tickets 
and curtail their own speeches to make room for the president and 
his entourage 
half of us were excited said jason gorman but there were 
those who thought it is more important for more of the relatives to 
come than the president 
but another senior adam cherry said its the greatest thing 
that could happen to a senior class 
each graduate got a handshake from bush and many of the girls 
stole a kiss as well the graduates wore blue and gold robes and 
bush was in academic garb himself 
cheltenhams alumni include baseball star reggie jackson robert 
meyers an architect of the social security system and dr michael 
brown a nobel prize winner for medicine

black men experience a faster heartbeat at 
moderate exercise than do their white counterparts a finding that 
may account for the greater incidence of high blood pressure and 
heart disease among blacks according to a north carolina researcher 
dr lars g ekelund an associate professor of medicine at the 
university of north carolina said an analysis of treadmill stress 
tests conducted as part of a national study showed black men tended 
to have about eight more heartbeats a minute than white men at the 
same levels of exercise 
we found a difference that was highly significant said 
ekelund in an interview monday if you take those eight beats it 
corresponds to about a 30 percent increase in risk for coronary 
heart disease 
the increased heartbeat rate during exercise could also explain 
why blacks tend to have more hypertension or high blood pressure 
and more strokes than whites he said resting pulse rates taken 
before the exercise showed no significant difference between the 
races 
ekelund said a weakness in the study is that only 83 black men 
participated while 2548 white men were counted a much larger study 
is needed he said to confirm the data 
ekelund said the pulse rates probably are a fundamental genetic 
difference between the races in their response to exercise this 
difference he said may be important when evaluating the cardiac 
health of a black male higher heartbeat rates usually suggest a 
person is less fit but for a black male the higher rate may be 
normal 
it suggests we should apply different norms for black males 
compared to whites said ekelund if the same norms are used for a 
black person as for a white person he said the difference in 
heartbeat rate would make a black man appear less fit than he 
actually is 
the study is based on data collected from men between the 20 and 
69 none of the test subjects had detectable heart disease when the 
tests were administered the data was adjusted said ekelund for 
differences in age weight and other factors which can affect 
individual heart rates 
ekelund said the research agrees with an earlier study that 
monitored the blood pressure of boys while they played stressful 
video games that study showed black youths tended to have higher 
blood pressure in response to the excitement of the game 
this suggests that blacks may inherit an increased response to 
stress which may explain their higher prevalence of hypertension 
he said 
the data used in the study was collected by the national heart 
lung and blood institute as part of a national research effort by 10 
clinics a massive amount of data was collected in the 1970s and is 
still being analyzed 
ekelund presented the research finding monday at the second 
international conference on preventive cardiology

heart disease death rates have been retreating 
for almost three decades in western industrialized countries and 
experts at an international conference say they still dont know why 
there is one less coronary heart attack every minute in this 
country said dr claude lenfant director of the national heart 
lung and blood institute we have witnessed a significant decrease 
in heart disease but the cause of this decline is not clear 
lenfant said the decline in heart attacks in the united states 
started in the 1960s when the rate of death from cardiac disease 
was more than 400 per 100000 persons the rate is dropping at a 
steady annual rate and now is about 330 per 100000 persons 
it keeps going down and there is no sign of its leveling off 
lenfant told reporters monday at the 2nd international conference on 
preventive cardiology 
he said the reasons could be a reduction in smoking better 
diets more exercise or better treatment but it would take a large 
comprehensive study to pinpoint the exact reason for the change 
the decline in the us of heart disease deaths is 
extraordinary said dr william t friedewald associate director 
for disease prevention at the national institutes of health but 
the us still has one of the highest rates in the world 
japan which already has one of the lowest rates of cardiac 
disease in the world is also experiencing a decline in death rates 
dr hirotsugu ueshima a researcher at the national 
cardiovascular center in osaka japan said that in 1970 there were 
120 cardiac disease deaths annually per 100000 persons over age 60 
in japan that rate now has dropped to 100 for those age 50 to 59 
the rate has dropped from 60 per 100000 in 1970 to 40 at present 
it is still going down said ueshima 
people in japan he said are now eating more animal fat thought 
to be a risk factor in heart disease but this has had no apparent 
impact on rate of heart disease 
even though there is more meat a source of animal fat in the 
diet it is still lower than the american diet he said japanese 
get about 25 percent of their calories from fat compared to about 
38 percent in the american diet he said 
healthier hearts however are not universal 
a world health organization study released at the conference 
shows deaths among men from heart disease rose steeply between 1970 
and 1985 in nearly all of the east european countries where data is 
available the study included only industrialized countries and did 
not include trend data from the soviet union 
bulgaria led the rate of reported increase with heart disease 
death rates shooting up by 62 percent by comparison in the united 
states during that same period the rates declined by 365 percent 
even with the increase however bulgaria still has a lower rate 
of heart disease mortality for men about 297 per 100000 persons 
than the us the report says 
the male heart disease death rate in other countries included 
increases of 30 percent in greece 369 percent in poland 428 
percent in yugoslavia 195 percent in hungary 181 percent in 
romania and 144 percent in east germany 
deaths among men from heart disease declined throughout western 
and northern europe and also in australia new zealand canada 
japan and israel an exception was ireland where the rate increased 
by 08 percent 
except for bulgaria east germany poland and yugoslavia heart 
disease death rates declined for women in all of the reported 
countries the rates for women declined most remarkably in israel 
and australia both with drops of about 50 percent in the united 
states the death rates for women dropped by 338 percent and stood 
at 119 per 100000 
according to the report the lowest rate of death due to heart 
disease was among women in france where the rate was 41 per 
100000 the highest was among men in northern ireland where the 
rate was 438 per 100000

information on what hazardous chemicals are 
being released from nearby industrial plants will soon be as close 
as the home computer or a neighborhood library says the 
environmental protection agency 
the epa unveiled its computerized database for toxic chemical 
releases on monday and said that in the coming months the 
information which will be updated yearly will be available in 
microfiche as well as computer disc and magnetic tape 
the inventory of releases which is based on information provided 
the epa by each company also may be obtained through toxnet a 
computer information system of the national library of medicine 
access to toxnet will cost 25 an hour and be accessible by home 
computers 24 hours a day 
a 1986 law which took effect last year requires industry to 
supply information each year on what toxic chemicals are being 
released from plants the requirement covers 328 hazardous chemicals 
it took the epa nearly a year to develop the computer database 
but charles elkins director of toxics at the agency said the job 
is likely to be easier and quicker next time around industry is 
scheduled to submit its second round of data at the end of this 
month covering releases in 1988 
the first set of data was submitted nearly a year ago reflecting 
releases in 1987 
we have tried to make the computerized inventory as user 
friendly as possible said epa administrator william k reilly 
the epa database allows a person to focus on a single industrial 
plant and learn what toxic releases into the air water or soil the 
plant has reported to the epa during the latest reporting year 
the system includes a variety of indexes including type of 
chemicals names of plants and locations of plants down to 
counties cities and postal zip codes officials said 
the epa said the computerized database or microfiche will be made 
available to more than 1400 federal libraries and local public 
libary systems so that at least one library in every county will 
have the data available 
in addition the database on computer disc or magnetic tape will 
be for sale through the government printing office or the national 
technical information system ntis

attorney general dick thornburgh says his 
decision to merge the justice departments organized crime strike 
forces into us attorneys offices will eliminate confusion and 
duplication in the current system 
thornburgh said monday the 14 strike forces will be abolished and 
organized crime units will be created in 23 us attorneys offices 
around the country by oct 1 
the plan which the attorney general earlier said he was 
considering has drawn fire from some in congress who contend it 
would blunt an effective weapon against organized crime 
thornburgh a former us attorney in pittsburgh said in a 
statement the changes are designed to ensure that the departments 
resources are more comprehensively directed against organized 
crime 
they will help reduce confusion and overlapping jurisdiction 
among federal investigators and prosecutors as well as making more 
resources available by shutting down duplicate offices thornburgh 
said 
congressional hearings are planned on the issue including one 
scheduled today by the house judiciary criminal justice subcommittee 
rep charles e schumer dny called thornburghs announcement 
on the eve of the subcommittees hearing sort of a slap in the 
face to the many senators and representatives who asked him to wait 
until we could really discuss this 
schumer said the subcommittee he chairs has taken no position on 
the issue but has heard good arguments both for keeping and for 
abolishing the strike forces 
if lawmakers determine thornburgh made a wrong decision we will 
consider introducing legislation to preserve the strike forces he 
said 
the strike forces were conceived in the 1960s by thenattorney 
general robert f kennedy 
since 1984 members of the top echelon of organized crime 
families in boston buffalo ny chicago kansas city cleveland 
brooklyn and philadelphia were convicted as a result of strike 
force prosecutions 
the debate over the strike forces is not new but it flared up 
earlier this year when thornburgh disclosed he was considered a plan 
to abolish them 
several senators including edward m kennedy dmass strom 
thurmond rsc and sam nunn dga urged thornburgh not to 
abolish the strike forces 
in an article published in mondays editions of the new york 
times nunn and kennedy argued that there is no justification for 
such a step 
they suggested that thornburgh was responding to the traditional 
hostility to strike forces by us attorneys who are protective of 
their turf 
ending all strike forces to assuage us attorneys egos would 
be a triumph of ideology over common sense and could destroy the 
federal organizedcrime program the senators wrote 
thomas puccio a former abscam prosecutor said it would be a 
mistake to abolish them 
you wont have a group thats permanently dedicated to 
organized crime said puccio a new york defense lawyer 
you also develop a certain amount of professionalism and 
although there are some outstanding us attorneys those selections 
are still made politically to some degree he said 
thornburgh said he would create an organized crime council within 
the justice department to coordinate the fight against such criminal 
activity 
beg your pardon

vietnam will on wednesday turn over the 
remains of what it believes are 28 american servicemen missing from 
the vietnam war a us military spokesman said 
maj dan trout said today that a us military team is to fly to 
hanoi the vietnamese capital for a turnover ceremony before the 
remains are flown to the united states 
the repatriation is to be the 10th since august 1987 when the 
united states made a special effort to get vietnamese help in 
resolving the missing in action or mia issue since then 184 
remains have been returned and 56 to date identified as those of 
american servicemen trout said 
a c141 transport aircraft will fly a team from the us joint 
casualty resolution center to hanoi airport it will be headed by 
lieut col james d spurgeon who is the jcrc representative in 
bangkok 
trout said the remains would be flown via guam to hawaii where 
the us military maintains a laboratory for the identification of 
mia remains 
official statistics show 2353 americans still listed as missing 
from the indochina war including 1719 in vietnam 545 in laos 83 
in cambodia and six in china 
some americans believe vietnam is also holding live americans but 
hanoi has denied this and concrete evidence has yet to surface from 
independent sources 
a group of 40 us congressmen is asking the bush administration 
to investigate a japanese monks claims that he shared a prison cell 
with three captive us soldiers and saw as many as 10 american 
prisoners while in vietnam 
the reported pow sightings came from iwanobu yoshida a 
65yearold buddhist monk imprisoned for 14 years before his release 
in january 
in a letter sent last week to bush the congressmen urged a 
thorough investigation of this recent account of american pows in 
vietnam

a prominent black roman catholic priest says he 
will start a new african american catholic congregation because 
the established church has failed to meet the spiritual and cultural 
needs of blacks 
we must now take our destiny in our own hands and create forms 
of worship and parish life attuned to african americans said the 
rev george a stallings jr the washington archdioceses director 
of evangelism 
he and several hundred black catholics will launch the new 
congregation on july 2 at howard university law school he said 
although stallings said in a statement he was sending cardinal 
james a hickey of washington detailed plans for the new 
congregation members of hickeys staff said monday no such word has 
reached the cardinal hickey is out of town until thursday 
stallings acknowledged that the new church does not have the 
approval approbation or blessing of hickey 
the rev kevin hart who as archdiocesan secretary for parish 
life and worship is stallings boss said stallings has no 
authority no authorization to start this congregation hart said 
he could not say what action the archdiocese would take 
but in general terms if a priest conducts a service that 
deviates in liturgy or doctrine from church norms he is 
considered to be in a state of schism from the church hart said 
stallings 41 denied that the venture is a break from 
traditional catholicism and said it is an effort to develop an 
africanamerican catholic rite with our own clergy and the 
right to determine our own parish life and ministry 
creating a more meaningful ministry for blacks has been an issue 
for many american catholic leaders at their semiannual meeting at 
seton hall university last weekend the us hierarchy voted 
unanimously to implement a pastoral plan for black catholics 
developed by the 13 black bishops in this country 
stallings a convert to catholicism attracted national attention 
as pastor of st teresa of avila parish in southeast washington when 
he began to incorporate into the traditional mass gospel music and 
preaching and worship styles familiar to many blacks 
in his 12 years at st teresas membership increased from 200 to 
2000 stallings said there are about 80000 black catholics in the 
washington archdiocese

the voyager 2 spacecraft has discovered a 
6200milewide dark spot on neptune and scientists believe its a 
giant storm similar to earths hurricanes and jupiters great red 
spot 
the width is about onefifth of neptunes 30700mile diameter 
just as the 16000milewide great red spot is about onefifth the 
size of jupiter said andrew ingersoll a planetary scientist at the 
california institute of technology 
voyager 2 was launched from cape canaveral in 1977 visited 
jupiter in 1979 saturn in 1981 and uranus in 1986 its twin 
voyager 1 explored jupiter in 1979 and saturn in 1980 and is now 
heading toward interplanetary space 
i had gotten sort of discouraged from the uranus encounter 
because uranus was such a bland place ingersoll said monday so 
im happy to see such action on neptune 
the top voyager scientist was similarly excited 
its huge caltech physicist and vice president edward stone 
said of the dark spot 
while the robot probe is too far from neptune to detect winds 
within the spot the spot seems to be a hurricanelike storm system 
similar to the great red spot which has 250 mph winds said stone 
chief scientist of the voyager project for the national aeronautics 
and space administration 
hurricanes on earth are much smaller measuring several hundred 
miles across unlike earths hurricanes which break up after a week 
or two jupiters great red spot has remained intact at least since 
its discovery more than 350 years ago a mystery scientists have 
yet to explain 
stone said neptunes dark spot became apparent in photographs 
taken by voyagers television cameras in april and faint hints of 
it can be seen in pictures made as early as january 
the absence of continents on giant gas planets such as jupiter 
and neptune may explain the persistence of the spots ingersoll 
said adding that continents may help dissipate hurricanes on earth 
voyager 2 is due to make its closest approach to neptune the 
solar systems fourthlargest planet at 9 pm pdt aug 24 
it will swoop 3000 miles from the planets north pole by far 
the closest approach of any of the flybys during the spacecrafts 
grand tour of the giant gaseous outer planets five hours 
later it will pass 25000 miles from triton one of two known 
neptunian moons 
voyager 2 today was 266 billion miles from earth and 5898 
million miles from neptune speeding toward that planet at 42216 
mph said mary beth murrill spokeswoman for nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
neptunes dark spot is about 25 to 30 degrees latitude in the 
planets southern hemisphere ingersoll said 
voyager 2 also discovered a much smaller rapidly changing white 
spot about half the size of the dark spot at about 70 degrees 
south latitude he said 
the dark spots color isnt yet known because scientists havent 
processed a complete set of pictures through different color 
filters ingersoll said but stone said it is darker than neptunes 
surrounding skies which are bluegreen because of methane in its 
mostly hydrogenhelium atmosphere 
jupiters great red spot is believed to get its color from 
organic chemicals or possibly sulfur or phosphorus trapped within 
it said ingersoll 
besides the great red spot jupiter contains dozens of smaller 
storm systems which appear as white spots saturn has similar 
storms although they are less visible stone said 
computer simulations suggest smaller storms combine to form giant 
storms such as the red spot and neptunes dark spot the scientists 
said 
the existence of neptunes dark spot is mysterious because 
scientists didnt think the planet had enough heat to drive fierce 
winds said ingersoll unlike jupiter saturn and neptune uranus 
lacks enough internal heat to create big storms stone said 
neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun and is about 
30 times farther from the sun than earth but because plutos 
elongated elliptical orbit sometimes brings it closer to the sun 
neptune will be the ninth and most distant planet from the sun until 
the year 2007

recreational boating fatalities continued to 
drop last year to a record low of 946 deaths while the number of 
registered boats increased according to the transportation 
department 
coast guard officials said the decline was the result of 
increased awareness of the danger of drinking while boating 
fatalities declined to 946 in 1988 from 1036 in 1987 1066 in 
1986 and 1116 in 1985 the department said the 1988 figure which 
amounted to 55 deaths per 100000 boats was the lowest since the 
coast guard began keeping track of boating fatalities 28 years ago 
the coast guard estimates that there were 173 million boats on 
the nations waterways in 1988 an increase of 400000 over the 
previous year

vandals have shattered eight ancient rock 
formations in eastern utahs fantasy canyon and a 500 reward is 
being offered for information leading to convictions 
the fragile formations of sandstone were among about 50 carved 
through the millenia by water erosion in the desert about 40 miles 
southeast of here said ray tate of the federal bureau of land 
management 
fantasy canyon has a lot of the most unique rock formations 
youve ever seen in your life he said theyre very fragile 
the damage occurred between april 1 when agency employees were

a mother jailed since august 1987 in a child 
custody dispute may not be freed until she produces her daughter for 
visits with her exhusband or turns the child over to public 
authorities a judge says 
district of columbia superior court judge herbert dixon refused 
on monday to release dr elizabeth morgan a washington plastic 
surgeon who was jailed 22 months ago on civil contempt of court 
charges 
morgan has refused to allow courtordered visits between her 
daughter hilary and eric foretich morgans exhusband and the 
girls father contending that foretich sexually abused the girl 
foretich has repeatedly denied those charges and hilarys 
whereabouts have been unknown 
an appeals court had directed dixon to review his december 1988 
decision to keep morgan in jail 
stephen sachs morgans attorney has argued that jailing her 
failed to coerce her into producing her daughter and that the 
purpose has turned from coercion to punishment 
but dixons ruling said the order which causes morgans 
incarceration was and continues to be for coercive purposes only 
and this has not changed due solely to the passage of time 
no credible evidence has been received concerning the childs 
present condition or circumstances notwithstanding morgans 
declaration that the the child is healthy happy and healing the 
judges ruling said 
dixon ruled that morgan should remain in jail because she has not 
taken the opportunity to go free by turning the child over to the 
district of columbias child custody division 
sachs called dixons ruling flatout wrong adding that 
morgan feels the social services arrangement a booby trap by which 
the child can be turned over to the father 
foretich said he hopes the ruling will force morgan to produce 
their daughter 
what hes done here is that he has stated that there is an 
alternate method by which elizabeth morgan can comply foretich 
said this option was always available to her and he has made 
that possibility very clear 
the house district of columbia committee today was to review a 
bill to limit civil contempt jailings in the district 
the bill sponsored by rep frank wolf rva would alter 
charges of civil contempt to criminal contempt after a person has 
been jailed for 12 months the measure would be applied 
retroactively to morgans case and would guarantee her a jury trial

cheryl hayes says she wont forget the hundreds 
of volunteers who in one week made her dream of a new home a reality 
in the heart of milwaukees inner city 
theyll never leave their spirits will always be here she 
said its a house made of love 
ms hayes 40 a social worker and divorced mother of three owns 
one of six homes built last week by the georgiabased habitat for 
humanity international 
the site is near where 12 people died two years ago in the citys 
deadliest house fire less than three weeks after the blaze a house 
fire several blocks away killed six people the death toll focused 
attention on housing ills for the largely minority population of the 
inner city 
now ms hayes who is black sees the efforts of habitat as part 
of a rebirth of the neighborhood where she has lived nearly a decade 
this is a beautiful neighborhood she said this is going 
to be the neighborhood someday 
former president carter and millard fuller executive director of 
the organization also think so 
carter and his wife rosalynn spent last week working on one of 
the homes for the former president it was the sixth year he has 
spent a week pounding nails and putting up walls in a habitat home 
i just know whats happened in other places where weve worked 
it kind of rejuvenates the people he said the whole 
neighborhood tries to stay up with them they kind of set a 
pattern 
the crews in milwaukee also renovated eight other homes last week 
habitat officials said similar work has occurred in about 150 
communities around the world as part of efforts to build more than 
3000 homes for lowincome people this year 
habitat founded by fuller in 1976 and based in americus ga is 
an ecumenical christian organization that uses volunteer labor and 
donated material to produce housing for needy people 
the homes are sold for no profit with nointerest loans the 
milwaukee homes cost from 24000 to 26000 with principal 
payments on the 1020 year mortgages to range from 100 to 250 a 
month 
each buyer must put in 500 hours of labor thats called sweat 
equity the buyers work on several homes 
it has a very positive impact for the families involved said 
walter farrell a professor at the university of wisconsinmilwaukee 
and a board member of the first wisconsin banks community 
involvement corp 
beyond that its only going to have a neighborhood impact if 
there are other projects in the area if the houses do not 
become oases in an area of dilapidated houses 
he said census data show that vacant or substandard housing in 
the central city is as high as 25 to 30 percent officials estimate 
800 dwellings are abandoned 
taking a break from installing siding on a house fuller said the 
whole community should work toward eliminating substandard housing 
and homelessness by the year 2000 
this is only one week but what if we did it every week what 
if everybody was concerned every week about everybody having a 
house the problem would be solved in a very few years 
ms hayes and diana wilson another of the six new homeowners 
said the project stirred interest in the black community it also 
stirred their emotions 
ms wilson 36 a school bus driver and nurses aide who will 
live in the house with her two sons said she arrived at her new 
home at 610 am one day no one was there 
i was walking around looking at the rooms and i didnt even 
realize i was crying the tears were just running down my face 
she said

a soviet ocean liner carrying west german 
tourists rammed an iceberg in the arctic norwegian sea and was 
taking on water tuesday many of the more than 900 people aboard

the 630foot maxim gorky radioed north norways rescue central at 
1227 am that it was listing after hitting an iceberg about 185 
miles west of the norwegian island of svalbard said a coast guard 
spokesman 
the soviets and norwegians said there were no reports of

from ice floes in nearfreezing temperatures and light rain about 
two miles from the maxim gorky some 225 people and the crew were 
said to still be on board 
the passengers appear to be in good shape and humor rescue 
operations are somewhat difficult because the lifeboats are near the 
ice which is moving said senja captain kjell tveiten via the 
ships radio 
about 575 passengers and 377 crew members were aboard the vessel 
the soviet merchant marine emergency preparedness office told 
norwegian state radio tass put the total at 953 
tveiten said maxim gorky was listing to starboard and appeared 
bowheavy but did not seem to be in immediate danger of sinking 
some passengers had climbed onto thick ice floes to walk to 
lifeboats and rafts lowered earlier from the damaged ship into the 
nearfreezing waters reports said 
the norwegian defense command said six rescue helicopters were 
dispatched and would begin carrying passengers to svalbard about a 
twohour flight 
several other soviet and norwegian ships were within 300 miles of 
the distressed ship which was in international waters 
hospitals in northern norway and on the norwegian islands of 
spitsbergen of which svalbard is the largest were on emergency 
alert 
the svalbard hospital was awaiting norwegian medical teams 
dispatched by helicopter said reports 
maxim gorky was built in west germany in 1969 and was sold to 
the soviet union in 1974 
in recent summers the liner has carried mostly west germans on 
tours from hamburg arranged by german tour operator nur news

president daniel ortega is seeking 
talks with the bush administration to cool nicaraguas mounting 
friction with the united states and help pull the economy out of its 
nosedive 
ortega announced the offer monday after a 1hour meeting with 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo he asked the roman catholic 
archbishop of managua to carry the request for opening negotiations 
to washington 
obando y bravo a sharp critic of ortegas leftist sandinista 
government said he was going to think about this and will give an 
answer but refused to go into details 
there was no immediate reaction from washington 
the cardinal and ortega standing side by side talked to 
reporters after their meeting 
we have asked cardinal obando y bravo to take steps and 
mediate with president bush so that a fluid dialogue can develop 
ortega said we are willing to develop a dialogue with the north 
american government so foundations can be laid for normalizing 
relations between nicaragua and the united states 
the last time nicaragua and the united states held talks on 
improving relations was in june 1984 in mexico and they ended in 
deadlock 
many of nicaraguas difficulties stem from a 1981 us decision 
to support contra rebels and cut off all financial aid to managua 
in 1985 washington prohibited us companies from doing business 
with nicaragua 
ortega said monday he much appreciated an open letter in which 
about 800 latin american bishops recently asked washington to lift 
the embargo 
the united states has argued that the sandinistas military ties 
with the soviet bloc their purported failure to carry out 
democratic reforms and their support of leftist rebels in 
neighboring el salvador endanger security in central america 
nicaragua claims its support of the salvadoran guerrillas has 
only been moral not material 
on june 12 the state department accused nicaragua of trying to 
restrict foreign monitoring of februarys presidential elections by 
requiring americans for the first time to acquire entry visas as 
of july 1 
on may 26 nicaragua expelled two us diplomats accusing them 
of helping incite a wildcat strikes by teachers demanding higher pay 
and better working conditions 
it was nicaraguas second big strike in three weeks 
taxi drivers stopped working in many cities when prices of 
gasoline along with most other goods more than doubled following 
a sharp devaluation june 12 of the cordoba currency 
the devaluation of the cordoba the 20th this year was part of 
an asuterity program announced by ortega jan 30 to try and check 
skyrocketing inflation that surpassed 20000 percent last year

out the possible direction of the foreign exchange trading

institutional investors remained on the sidelines 
in currency dealings the bank of japan reportedly sold dollars 
in small amounts at about 14360 yen to 14370 yen traders said 
the amount of intervention was not clear the central bank does not 
comment on its monetary activities

united mine workers president richard 
trumka who brought a new era of peace to the coal industry 
presides over a union embroiled in its biggest labor dispute since 
he took office seven years ago 
a 40yearold lawyer and the son and grandson of pennsylvania 
coal miners trumka has won respect from his members and from his 
adversaries the coal industrys top executives 
but some coal officials have complained that trumka hasnt done 
enough to to bring an end to a wildcat strike that began june 12 in 
southern west virginia and by this week had spread to kentucky 
pennsylvania ohio indiana alabama illinois tennessee and 
missouri idling more than 27000 miners 
the strikers say they wont go back until the pittston coal group 
signs a contract with the union which has been on strike against 
the company since april 
we have no control over pittston we have no control over mr 
trumka yet we are being severely penalized by the strike our 
employees are being penalized said robert quenon chairman of the 
bituminous coal operators association the industrys main 
bargaining unit 
i think the union leadership ought to exercise a leadership 
role and lead the miners back to work 
trumka and chief union spokesman joe corcoran did not return 
repeated phone calls over the past nine days seeking comment about 
the strike 
on monday the union sent a telegram to miners advising them to 
return to work in accordance with a national labor contract signed 
by umw members 
when trumka assumed his job in 1982 he was the umws fourth 
president in 10 years 
his predecessors included tony boyle who went to prison for 
murdering a union rival arnold miller whose health forced him to 
resign leaving the union in disarray and sam church jr who lost 
support when he negotiated a contract in 1981 that was rejected by 
the rankandfile leading to a 72day strike just four years after 
a 111day walkout 
trumka took over a union known for its street brawls among union 
officials and for widespread wildcats one over grievance 
procedures that idled 70000 miners in 1975 which the umw leaders 
appeared to be unable to control 
he worked to focus the memberships efforts less on internal 
disputes and more on fighting the companies he won broad new powers 
from the membership including the unions first strike fund and the 
authority to call selective strikes 
he used some of those powers to negotiate a contract in 1984 
without an industrywide strike the first time in 20 years and 
again in 1988 
an indication of his support was his reelection without 
opposition in 1987 to a second fiveyear term 
you know coal miners can get into knockdown and dragout 
fights said local 340 president frank thurman in cedar grove 
but when the chips are down we know who the adversary is the 
adversary is not within the adversary is the coal operators who 
think they can reverse time and take us back 
just before his reelection trumka discussed what he called the 
unions newfound course 
weve become less reactionary he said the mine workers 
used to just wait for something to happen now rather than just 
reacting to things were starting to plan 
the unions strike against the pittston coal group prompted last 
weeks sympathy strike and is the second during trumkas tenure 
the first was a 15month walkout by 1100 miners against the at 
massey coal co in west virginia and kentucky which ended with the 
union accepting the companys offer and the company being split up 
by its owners local officials said neither side won 
with the pittston strike involving 1800 miners in virginia 
west virginia and kentucky the union has jeopardized its newfound 
cooperative relationship and its 100 million strike fund 
a virginia judge has ordered fines of 3 million because of the 
unions campaign of civil disobedience and three union officials 
including strike coordinator marty hudson were held for two weeks 
without bail in the roanoke va city jail for orchestrating the 
picketline activities the three were released from jail monday 
the union also has been named in several damage suits filed in 
us district court by companies that won backtowork orders only 
to see the miners ignore them

saturday in bunbury said immigration spokeswoman jenny hoskin 
the man claimed he had a pregnant wife in china and that a

china supporting the prodemocracy movement had fallen into the

defection 
she asks that her privacy be respected said an official who 
could not be named as is customary here

sea since jan 19 the aap said 
it said he learned of the political upheaval in china and the 
armys june 4 assault on unarmed civilians in beijings tiananmen 
square from australian and british radio reports hundreds of 
chinese were killed in the assault and more than 1300 have been 
reported arrested since for taking part in unrest 
zhu told officials he hoped eventually to be reunited with his

the florida senate approved a bill that 
would jail gun owners who dont secure their loaded weapons the 
action came in response to accidental shootings that killed three 
children and wounded four this month 
the nation is watching to see what florida does sen jeanne 
malchon a cosponsor of the legislation said before mondays 324 
vote sent the bill to the house 
its probably at this point one of the first bills in the 
nation aimed at safety of children in access to guns senate 
president bob crawford said 
it didnt do everything that i wanted it to but its a bill 
that will significantly encourage safety so im very pleased that 
we passed it 
a house committee was scheduled to consider the bill this morning 
as the legislature began the second day of a threeday special 
session called by gov bob martinez 
accidental gunshots are the fifthleading cause of death of us 
children under age 14 and florida has one of the three highest 
rates of accidental shootings in the country according to malchon 
who proposed similar legislation two years ago 
under the bill adults who fail to secure a loaded weapon that is 
used by a minor in an accidental shooting could be charged with a 
felony and sentenced to five years in prison and fined 5000 it 
would be a misdemeanor if a minor displayed the gun or threatened 
someone with it 
opponents narrowed the bills scope by exempting unloaded 
firearms and guns kept in cars or boats and dropping the age of 
minors to under 16 from under 18 
senators also decided to require the state department of 
education to come up with a gun safety education plan by next spring 
rather than adding such a provision to the bill itself 
marion hammer the national rife associations florida 
spokeswoman said the legislation was phony unreal and a 
disservice to the people of florida she blamed the controversy on 
the media 
the legislature felt that it needed to do something so that you 
folks would shut up she told reporters 
the house had approved a version of the bill during the regular 
session but the senate failed to act on it 
in addition to taking up the senate version the house also was 
scheduled to consider a bill that would punish anyone selling or 
loaning a weapon to an unsupervised minor without parental 
permission the bill also would require gun owners to keep their 
firearms locked and empty 
another house proposal would require gun stores to post signs to 
warn gunowners about leaving loaded firearms within reach of 
children 
a rash of accidental shootings this month prompted martinez to 
include the bill in the special session which originally was called 
over a 24 billion turnpike expansion plan 
silvio claud pierre 4 died saturday a week after he had shot 
himself at his familys home the tampa boy found a 25caliber 
semiautomatic handgun under a couch while his mother was in the 
shower his father was not at home 
on june 6 a 10yearold orlando boy was killed by a playmate on 
june 5 an 8yearold miramar girl was killed by her 10yearold 
brother who thought his fathers gun was unloaded 
four children ages 4 to 16 were accidentally wounded this month

a british journalist arrested twice for 
violating chinese martial law said today that the prodemocracy 
movement remains alive in china despite the governments efforts to 
suppress it 
brian barron made the comments after arriving in hong kong from 
china 
barron asian correspondent for the british broadcasting corp 
said chinese authorities returned his passport monday after holding 
it for a week following his second arrest he was required to write 
a selfcriticism for violating martial law restrictions on 
reporting 
however the 49yearold journalist said he had not been expelled 
and was free to return to china any time he was accompanied by his 
wife daughter and three members of his television crew 
we were free to leave when we liked and we chose to leave 
today he said after our holiday i hope to go back to china 
and continue reporting 
on monday beijing ordered the expulsion of the sixth foreign 
journalist in 10 days given 72 hours to leave was joseph kahn an 
american working parttime for the dallas morning news he was in 
china on a tourist visa 
last week china expelled two beijingbased american 
correspondents on charges of violating martial law in addition 
three journalists of britains independent television news who were 
not based in china have been deported 
after arriving in hong kong barron said he believes the 
prodemocracy movement which the government has tried to put down 
beginning with the military assault in beijing on june 34 still 
has broad popularity 
i dont think the prodemocracy movement in the sense of mass 
feelings of change has been crushed he told reporters at hong 
kong airport after arriving from beijing barron is based in hong 
kong 
in fact when we drove to the airport this morning we did see 
a few truckloads of troops but we also saw at least one individual 
pass our bus and give the v sign the symbol of the 
prodemocracy movement 
we interpreted it as a gesture of defiance or support for 
the prodemocracy movement he said 
barron said he has covered china off and on for 15 years 
he said he was first detained june 8 while he and his crew were 
filming a burnedout tank in the capital 
he said they were forced to kneel on the road at gunpoint their 
equipment was seized and parts were smashed 
his second detention a week ago was entirely different we did 
selfcriticisms we were not abused in any way and after three 
hours of interrogation we were allowed to go to our hotel 
under martial law foreign reporters are barred from talking to 
chinese about martial law or taking pictures of soldiers 
journalists generally have ignored the regulations however 
barron said he continued reporting after the second arrest and 
no effort was made to stop him

more toxic chemicals are released into the air 
in toole county utah than any other county in the united states 
the environmental protection agency says 
in fact the 68 million pounds of toxic chemicals released in 
that county each year account for all the toxic chemical releases 
into the air in utah that were reported to the epa the federal 
agency said monday 
other county hot spots for toxic industrial air pollution with 
more than 45 million tons of hazardous chemical released were 
warren county in virginia mobile county in alabama and ascension 
county in louisiana 
the county breakdown was included in a report that showed 27 
billion pounds of toxic chemicals are released by industry into the 
air annually the overall figure had been reported before but the 
detailed breakdown by counties had not previously been available 
the epa provided no industrial plants in its summary referring 
only to the individual counties 
but the natural resources defense council citing the epa report 
and other agency documents said that amax corp in rowley utah 
accounted for all of the reported toxic pollutants in tooele county 
the nrdc also cited these companies 
avtex fibers of front royal va 501 million pounds in warren 
county 
courtaulds north america inc of lemoyne ala 42 million 
pounds in mobile county 
triad chemical donaldsonville la 198 million pounds and 
cf industries also of donaldsonville 162 million pounds in 
ascension county 
meanwhile the epa said that 25 counties accounted for twothirds 
of the discharges of toxic chemicals into surface water 
san bernardino county in california had by far the largest 
volume nearly 37 billion pounds about twothirds of which came 
from a single company the chemical involved was usually sodium 
sulfate which the epa said it is planning soon to take off the 
toxic chemical list on the grounds that it poses no serious health 
threat 
harrison county in mississippi had the next largest volume of 
discharges into surface water with 369 million pounds followed by 
harris county in texas with 296 million pounds according to epa 
here are the 25 counties listed by epa as having the highest

a standing ovation at the end of 
tchaikovskys piano concerto no 1 13 curtain calls and four 
encores marked van cliburns triumphant return to the concert stage 
after 11 years 
the tchaikovsky was cliburns signature number after he won the 
first tchaikovsky competition in moscow in 1958 he was an instant 
celebrity at age 23 and the first classical musician ever given a 
tickertape parade in new york 
two decades later he began an 11year hiatus saying his schedule 
of up to 100 concerts a year was too grueling 
he has given two private performances since 1978 at the white 
house in december 1987 during soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs 
visit and january 1988 and the bob hope cultural center in palm 
springs calif 
monday night a crowd estimated at between 10000 and 12000 
welcomed him back at the mann music center openair amphitheater 
tickets sold for up top 125 each 
its so good to be back with the philadelphia orchestra 
cliburn said following monday mornings rehearsal it seems like i 
never left 
in addition to the tchaikovsky cliburn performed liszts piano 
concerto no 1 with stanislaw skrowaczewski guest conductor 
cliburns piano was brought on stage and an uncustomary hush fell 
on the audience as they waited for the tall lanky texan to appear 
he walked out and stood before a microphone 
this is a very sentimental evening for me an evening of 
remembrance of two old friends he said 
he was referring to eugene ormandy hungarianborn music director 
of the philadelphia orchestra for 44 years and impressario fredric 
r mann a former us ambassador who ran the music center in 
philadelphias fairmount park from 1949 until his death in 1987 the 
name was changed from robin hood dell in 1980 to honor mann 
cliburn joined forces with ormandy and the philadelphia musicians 
within weeks of his moscow triumph 
i remember that time so well we were all together then not 
just for one concert but several concerts he said 
the relationship continued through years of concerts and 
recordings mann became a close friend and was later an associate 
when cliburn moved into the business world 
ormandy retired in 1980 and died five years later 
mann worked hard to build the summer classical concert season 
attended on each of the 18 concert dates by up to 10000 people who 
only had to mail in a newspaper coupon for free tickets 
tickets sold for up to 125 with proceeds going to the summer 
classical program general admission tickets for spots on the grassy 
hillside behind the covered covered ampitheater sold for 1250 
mann wanted everyone on the face of the earth to believe in 
classical music cliburn said which was why the philadelphia 
orchestra summer series was so important to him

university of oklahoma coach barry switzer 
bid an emotional farewell to college football ending turmoil over 
recruiting violations and the arrests of five players on rape 
shooting and drug charges 
i finally decided the time has come for new leadership 
switzer said monday i will never coach at another institution i 
will never coach at another college level i promise you that 
his resignation ended a 16year career in which he brought the 
sooners three national titles and established the fourth best 
alltime winning percentage 
officials scheduled a news conference today to name a successor 
gov henry bellmon issued a statement praising switzer for 
posting an unparalleled record of success in college football 
history 
switzer 52 had been under pressure since the schools football 
program was placed on three years probation by the national 
collegiate athletics association in december and after five players 
were charged with felonies 
one player was charged with wounding another in a dormitory 
shooting three players were charged with raping a woman in a 
dormitory and one player was charged with conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine 
the states three largest newspapers and the schools student 
paper had called for switzers resignation and the 1949 team 
canceled a 40year reunion because of the problems 
 
its no fun anymore im drained i dont have the energy level 
to compete in this arena today said switzer who has complained 
recently about the impact of drugs on college athletics 
switzer also said he was frustrated by ncaa rules that do not 
recognize the financial needs of young athletes 
we have created a system that does not permit me or the program 
to buy a pair of shoes or a decent coat for a player whose family 
cant afford these basic necessities 
how can any coach stick to these rules when a young mans 
father dies many miles away and the son has no money for a plane 
ticket home to the funeral 
switzer finished with a 157294 record an 844 winning 
percentage his teams won national championships in 1974 1975 and 
1985

food labels would be required to include the 
products cholesterol content caloric value and the specific source 
of all vegetable oils used under a proposal presented to the 
american medical association 
the plan offered by california delegates to the amas annual 
policymaking convention also would mandate saturated fat content 
listings on labels cholesterol and such fats have been linked to 
cardiovascular problems 
a related resolution presented monday asked the association to 
seek truthful labeling of food products along with warnings 
regarding sodium cholesterol and the additive content of packaged 
food products 
the ama would call upon the federal trade commission to 
investigate the advertising practices of food manufacturers who 
present their products as low in sodium or cholesterol under the 
second plan submitted by dr louis f alfano a delegate from the 
american society of abdominal surgeons 
both resolutions were referred to an ama committee that was to 
vote on whether to recommend that the associations house of 
delegates adopt them as policy 
a critic said the measures were vague and would provide useless 
and misleading information to millions of people over age 60 whose 
cholesterol levels cannot be altered by what they eat 
but supporters say many other consumers would be wellserved by 
such labeling 
health conscious consumers are often misled by the advertising 
and labeling of common food products such as canned soups labeled as 
low sodium which contain a substantial sodium content but are only 
lower in sodium than the manfacturers regular line of soups 
alfano said 
the ama can clear up the confusion by asking the us food and 
drug administration to assist the consumer by requiring more 
specific food labeling he told committee members 
dr arnold briet an alternate delegate presented the california 
plan and said he supported alfanos resolution 
cholesterol is a waxy substance that can contribute to clogged 
arteries and heart disease depending on what type of fatty proteins 
carry it through the blood 
it is produced naturally in the body and develops from eating 
food with saturated fats or pure cholesterol such as eggs butter 
and animal fat 
the fda has implemented labeling standards that allow foods to be 
billed as cholesterolreduced even though they still have large 
amounts of cholesterol briet said 
nowhere do they require the source of the oils to be labeled 
he said 
some plant fats such as coconut and palm oils contain high 
amounts of saturated fatty acids that can help cholesterol form and 
food manufacturers like nabisco brands inc and quaker oats co have 
taken steps to remove such oils from their products 
dr henry mineur an internist and delegate from new jersey 
noted that there is an ongoing debate over socalled good and 
bad cholesterol he said the proposals would be useless unless 
they called for labels to differentiate between the two 
quit this damn hype that all types of cholesterol are bad for 
everybody mineur told the committee 
bad cholesterol is carried through the bloodstream by 
lowdensity lipoproteins linked to the buildup of harmful deposits 
in the arteries 
good cholesterol is carried by highdensity lipoproteins that 
researchers believe suck up excess cholesterol in the bloodstream 
furthermore mineur argued reducing cholesterol consumption is 
only useful for those under age 60 theres no evidence that people 
older than that can lower their risk of heart disease by altering 
their intake of fats he said

a company handling auctions for the 
federal government is under investigation for the loss of millions 
of dollars in profits reports said 
an investigation by federal authorities centers on allegations 
that northrop worldwide aircraft services inc took auction profits 
through bill padding and fraud nbc news reported monday evening 
the crescent city califbased company has a contract with the 
us customs service to recover maintain and sell seized or 
forfeited personal property usually through auctions 
us attorney bob wortham is presenting his findings to a federal 
grand jury here the beaumont enterprise reported 
wortham said the department of justice prohibited him from 
discussing any investigation 
northrop spokesman tony canpafio said the company is working with 
the government in the investigation 
weve been subpoenaed and weve provided documents canpafio 
said 
first word on the investigation was in april at a hearing before 
a us house ways and means committee subcommittee chaired by rep 
jj pickle dtexas 
pickle said lax accounting controls account for the loss of 
millions of dollars in the customs auctions in fiscal 1988 
customs agents made more than 53000 property seizures with a 
domestic value of about 11 billion 
the investigation began after area banker george talbert 
complained of fees charged by northrop to sell a vehicle seized in a 
drugrelated arrest in lumberton in 1987 
the first state bank of lumberton had a lien of 4700 to 5000 
on the chevrolet suburban talbert said talbert who worked at the 
bank said customs offered to buy the car for 4500 but later told 
him it would be auctioned and money left after expenses would go to 
the bank 
customs estimated the vehicles value at about 8500 northrop 
auctioned it in houston for 4300 and charged 700 to tow the 
vehicle 90 miles to the auction and a 1400 commission the bank 
was left with about 1900 
i was mad talbert said i wrote to the company asking for 
a detailed statement of their expenses 
talbert also wrote wortham after worthams office investigated 
the sale the company sent the bank an additional 1000 he said 
the investigation widened in january when authorities obtained a 
search warrant for northrops lawton okla offices to obtain 
transcripts on all customs auctions for the past three years 
in affidavits customs agents said northrop employees contended 
the company billed customs for maintaining and storing seized 
property for as long as three months after the property was disposed 
agents also reported northrop withheld information stored in one 
computer when agents served a subpoena issued by a grand jury in 
beaumont requesting all business records concerning northrops 
contract with customs 
its commissioner william von raab said the agency loses money 
on its auctions because customs warehouses store more than just 
fancy cars and boats 
when you lump all of our forfeitures together including those 
made lets say of fruit that doesnt meet fda food and drug 
administration rules or blue jeans that violate a quota or mismark 
then we dont make a profit he said 
some in congress say there is no excuse for customs to lose money 
on their auctions especially when the seized property is acquired 
at no cost 
either the auctions are rigged or else theyre being very 
poorly run said rep richard schulze rpa

the man mentioned as jim wrights most 
likely congressional successor urged the former house speaker to try 
to retain his seat saying he was still the best representative for 
the district 
nobody has a right to tell the people of fort worth and this 
community who their congressman ought to be state sen hugh 
parmer told reporters monday 
the people of this community ought to make that choice and i 
am persuaded having talked to them that if they have that option 
they will overwhelmingly reelect jim wright as the congressman from 
the 12th district parmer said his fellow fort worth democrat and 
longtime friend either should remain in congress or if he fulfills 
his promise to resign run again for the seat in a special election 
about 30 supporters at a saturday breakfast urged wright to put 
his name on the ballot in a special election for the 12th district 
seat the fort worth startelegram reported today 
the newspaper said wright neither encouraged nor discouraged the 
effort to draft him but told supporters he would think about 
running according to some who were at the meeting 
wright spokesman mark johnson said the congressman was gratified 
by supporters suggestions but is not encouraging this and his 
plans have not changed 
wright resigned may 31 as speaker and said hed give up his house 
seat by the end of june to end a furor over allegations he violated 
house ethics rules 
he is proceeding with the transition into private life by the 
end of june johnson said though no resignation date has been set 
parmer had been mentioned most often as the likeliest democrat to 
run for the post wright has held since 1954 
but at a news conference in austin earlier monday parmer said he 
was sticking with his announced plan to challenge republican us 
sen phil gramm in 1990 parmer waited for his afternoon appearance 
at fort worths meacham field airport to throw his support behind 
wright 
the vast majority of people in fort worth believe that while 
jim may have made some mistakes of judgment as jim has admitted 
it did not warrant the kind of penalty or price that he is talking 
about paying he said 
asked whether wright still planned to leave office parmer said 
i would say that he said neither yes nor no he simply listened 
to what i had to say

attorneys for richard ramirez rested their 
case after calling 35 witnesses but passing up the chance to have 
the defendant testify in the 5monthold night stalker murder 
trial 
defense attorney ray clark said monday the decision on whether to 
testify was left to ramirez and he decided not to take the witness 
stand 
the 29yearold drifter from el paso texas is charged with 13 
murders and 30 related felonies in a crime wave that terrorized 
california during the summer of 1985 pentagrams a symbol of devil 
worship were found at some murder scenes and the assailant gouged 
out the eyes of one victim 
ramirez is a selfproclaimed devil worshiper who once shouted 
hail satan in court a jailer testified that he used his own 
blood to draw a pentagram on the floor of his cell 
during the defenses monthlong presentation attorneys called 
witnesses who gave ramirez alibis for some of the killings most 
notably ramirez father testified that the defendant was home in el 
paso when two of the slayings occurred 
the defense also entered 65 pieces of evidence and attacked the 
credibility of witnesses who identified ramirez as the shaggy haired 
killer who entered homes through unlocked windows and doors 
deputy district attorney p philip halpin said he planned to 
begin presenting rebuttal witnesses today he said his rebuttal 
should take about a week the prosecution has presented 137 
witnesses and 521 pieces of evidence 
clark said it was unlikely the defense would call any more 
witnesses after rebuttal 
superior court judge michael tynan scheduled final arguments to 
begin july 10 after the jury takes a week vacation 
the case appears headed for a conclusion far sooner than the two 
years anticipated when the trial began 
but halpin said he was still disturbed by the four years that 
have elapsed since ramirez was arrested the trial followed years of 
pretrial motions and a lengthy preliminary hearing 
we have not done this efficiently halpin said adding he 
hoped the court system would learn from the case that we cant 
take forever to try these cases

burma has officially changed its name in 
english to the union of myanmar and renamed the capital of rangoon 
to yangon the staterun working peoples daily said 
also monday the military government tightened controls on 
political literature and reopened primary schools nationwide one 
year after all classrooms were closed in the wake of prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
the government said it would reopen junior high schools high 
schools and universities but has not given specific dates 
in the law changing burmas name the nationality burmese 
also was changed to myanmar the word for burma and burmese in the 
burmese language are both pronounced myanmar 
the names of states towns and other geographical sites are to be 
written in english according to the burmese pronunciation the law 
says rangoon for example is to be written as yangon which is the 
burmese pronunciation of the capital 
the military rulers who seized power in september while brutally 
putting down the popular uprising for democratic reforms had already 
dropped the term socialist republic calling the country the 
union of burma in english 
the move was an apparent attempt to appease a populace angered by 
a quarter century of ruinous socialist policies 
the latest change in the countrys name government officials 
say is to better reflect burmas ethnic diversity the term burma 
connotes burman the dominant race in the country to the 
exclusion of ethnic minorities 
several minority groups have been fighting for greater autonomy 
from the central government for four decades 
the government on monday increased penalties against violators of 
a 1962 law on publications increasing maximum prison terms from 
three to seven years and fines from 320 to 4800 for those who 
publish material without proper registration 
the act says printing presses must be registered with authorities 
and forbids falsification of facts in declarations by printers and 
publishers 
saw muangs military council has promised general elections next 
year and allowed the formation of opposition political parties and 
many of the 200 parties have published antigovernment pamphlets 
without official permission

house speaker tom foley said federal judges and 
senior executive branch employees should get pay raises 
foley said that before any action is taken on the pay boosts for 
judges and executive branch employees he would wait for a report 
thats expected to recommend a pay increase for congress 
the report likely to be completed this summer is expected to 
suggest a ban on speaking fees and other honoraria in exchange for 
the pay raise 
it may well be that theyll recommend that we phase out 
honorariums over a period of years with perhaps an increase over a 
period of years starting in the next congress for members of 
congress foley said monday during a political fundraiser in new 
york 
but in any event whatever happens i want to see this congress 
propose and send to the president an increase for judges and for 
senior civil servants in the executive branch 
foleys comments are the first indication that congress is 
willing to reopen the politically volatile issue 
the house in february faced with a public outcry killed a 51 
percent pay increase for judges senior executives and legislators 
in what was seen as a major defeat for thenspeaker jim wright 
since the vote congress has been pressured to increase the 
salary of senior executive branch employees and federal judges 
whose salaries traditionally are tied to those of congress 
with the renewed interest in ethics in washington congress has 
been considering a ban on speaking fees and other outside sources of 
income 
judicial and executive branch employees already are forbidden 
from accepting most speaking fees and other outside income

federal officials say they hope an offer 
of higher pay will attract and keep air traffic controllers at the 
nations busiest towers and control centers 
transportation secretary samuel skinner announced that 2100 
federal aviation administration controllers technicians and safety 
inspectors at 11 facilities in the new york chicago los angeles 
and oakland areas will get pay raises of up to 20 percent 
the air traffic controllers in the busiest centers of this 
country will be some of the highest paid people in the federal 
government skinner said monday at faa offices near ohare 
international airport the nations busiest ive been to those 
centers and frankly i think those jobs deserve that kind of 
compensation 
many faa control rooms have been chronically understaffed since 
former president reagan fired some 11400 air traffic controllers 
during an illegal strike in august 1981 
the new plan was criticized as a bandaid on a hemorrhage by 
ray l spickler executive vice president of the national air 
traffic controller association he said the raises would cover only 
a fraction of a nationwide work force of 16000 
the union was certified to represent the nations 7000 air 
traffic controllers in 1987 replacing the professional air traffic 
controllers organization which was decertified after the 1981 
strike 
it will address shortterm problems union spokesman tony 
dresden said of the wage plan we would hope that the faa would 
look at fair compensation for all controllers 
faa officials say the agency has difficulty staffing the 11 
facilities with qualified workers because of high living costs 
complex operations and other unattractive features 
in addition many workers in new york chicago and los angeles 
are close to retirement age skinner said 
united airlines which has been urging higher salaries at ohare 
applauded the program 
we believe this action is an encouraging step toward improving 
ohares ability to efficiently handle commercial air traffic at the 
nations busiest airport the carrier said 
transportation department officials said the program will cost an 
extra 5 million a year from department funds requiring minor 
cutbacks in other programs the 5year demonstration project will be 
made permanent if it is successful skinner said 
toplevel air traffic controllers now make 60000 to 65000 a 
year including overtime before the raises 
skinner said union representatives indicate the program is 
already working at targeted facilities the faa has received a lot 
of applications for the positions since the program was announced in 
march and those applying are highly skilled 
the program earlier this year survived attempts by congress to 
restrict it workers at ohare and limit raises to 10 percent of base 
pay department officials said 
the faa facilities affected by the incentive plans include air 
traffic control centers in aurora ill and ronkonkoma ny and 
the ohare and los angeles international airport towers and terminal 
radar approach control facilities 
the program also covers approachcontrol facilities at westbury 
ny santa ana and oakland calif and flight standards district 
offices in los angeles farmingdale and valley stream ny and

eighteen chinese refugees arrived by 
boat in the philippines last week after fleeing the political 
turmoil in their country a un official said today 
karola paul deputy representative of the un high commissioner 
for refugees said the 16 men and two women arrived june 13 aboard a 
wooden boat in batanes province 410 miles north of manila 
she said the agency told its regional offices last week that 
chinese might try to flee because of the suppression of dissent 
following the june 4 killing of hundreds of unarmed prodemocracy 
protesters by troops in beijing 
miss paul said she did not know where the chinese boat people 
came from but would ask philippine authorities to grant custody to 
her agency 
the chinese who did not have travel papers were taken to army 
headquarters in manila and were to be interviewed by immigration 
officials she said 
to me they are asylumseekers miss paul said we have 
been alerted of an outflow from china since the turmoil but it 
would be very difficult to say if there will be more 
also today two manila newspapers reported that the philippine 
embassy in beijing had received queries from chinese students 
seeking asylum but discouraged them for fear of offending the 
beijing government 
malaya and the manila chronicle quoted an unidentified source in 
the department of foreign affairs as saying the decision to put off 
applicants was taken on the recommendation of philippine diplomats 
in the chinese capital 
it would not be favorable for the philippines because we do not 
have the muscle to do what the us is doing the newspapers 
quoted the source as saying we dont have a bargaining chip with 
china 
china has sharply criticized the united states for sheltering 
chinese dissident fang lizhi and his wife in the us embassy in 
beijing 
president corazon aquino has deplored the violence in beijing but 
stopped short of criticizing chinas leadership 
last year she visited china and received assurances from senior 
leader deng xiaoping that beijing would not support filipino 
communist rebels seeking to establish a marxist state in this 
country 
western and filipino sources say there is no evidence china is 
supporting the insurgents

hundreds of northerners have embarked on a 
pilgrimage to one of the shrines of the civil rights movement of the 
1960s to commemorate the slayings of three young men in 
philadelphia miss 
a 13bus convoy carrying about 500 northerners left here monday 
for ceremonies marking the 25th anniversary of the slayings 
i expect to learn about how they got involved why they got 
involved said craig johnson 21 an antioch college student who 
is working as a summer intern in philadelphia city government it 
will help us to appreciate what they endured 
the buses including three from new york city were scheduled to 
arrive today in meridian miss near the small town of 
philadelphia where ceremonies wednesday will honor james earl 
chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner 
the three men were shot to death june 21 1964 after they had 
gone to inspect a church burned by the ku klux klan their bodies 
were found 44 days later in an earthen dam 
it is important to commemorate the sacrifices that were made in 
the civil rights movement said larry pitt 37 the philadelphia 
pa attorney came up with the idea for the convoy last winter after 
watching the movie mississippi burning a dramatization of the 
slayings and the resulting investigation 
it gives us the opportunity to bring into the consciousness of 
the whole country the need for a continuing commitment to civil 
rights pitt said 
seven men eventually were convicted in federal court of violating 
the three mens civil rights another defendant pleaded guilty 
eight were acquitted and the cases against the three others ended in 
mistrials murder charges were dropped in state court 
the philadelphia to philadelphia project is sponsored by the 
chaney goodman schwerner memorial coalition which is cochaired 
in pennsylvania by mayor w wilson goode us rep william h gray 
iii pitt and seven others and in mississippi by secretary of state 
dick mopus 
goode the first black mayor of the nations fifthlargest city 
will fly to mississippi with about 150 people wednesday to address a 
commemoration of the past at mount zion methodist church in 
philadelphia 
james farmer former executive director of the congress of racial 
equality and members of the victims families also will speak 
the pennsylvania convoy will leave mississippi on thursday as 
will a southtonorth convoy that will stop in washington for 
meetings with members of congress and a rally at the capitol friday 
the convoy will go to new york saturday for a ceremony at st john 
the divine church 
several participants said the trip will provide valuable insight 
to know where youre going youve got to know where you came 
from said jack franklin 67 a curator at the afroamerican 
historical and cultural museum in philadelphia pa 
he said he was struck by the small proportion of whites boarding 
the buses in pennsylvania 
when martin luther king marched there was 25 to 30 percent 
whites he said here its maybe 1 percent that will give you 
something to think about that will give you an idea where the 
country is headed im not being bitter im just telling you the 
truth 
but pitt the organizer said he hoped the trip would demonstrate 
that the civil rights legacy belongs to all americans 
the lessons we intend to present this week are lessons which 
the country must learn which is that the price of liberty is 
eternal vigilance that the civil rights movement though it was 
focusing on the rights of blacks was an american movement a 
patriotic movement

saudi arabias official executioner a 
skilled swordsman who has dispatched more than 600 convicted 
criminals says beheading is less difficult than chopping off the 
hands of thieves 
frankly its easier to chop off a head since this act means 
the end of the story for the criminal saeed alsayyaf 60 said 
in an interview with the saudi newspaper almedina 
chopping off a hand needs more courage since you are cutting 
off a part of the body of an individual who is to survive he said 
the act requires very skilled attention to ensure that the 
sword does not slip or cut in the wrong place saeed said in the 
interview which was republished by a dubaibased englishlanguage 
newspaper the khaleej times 
his name has an odd ring in arabic saeed means happy and 
alsayyaf swordsman executioner he changed his second name when 
he was appointed to the job more than 35 years ago 
the executioner says he doesnt suffer remorse for his victims 
since he is carrying out islamic justice as required by the koran 
the holy book of islam the koran decrees that convicted murderers 
be beheaded and thieves lose a hand saudi authorities last year 
ruled that drug smugglers also should be executed 
alsayyaf started out as a farmer but joined the saudi army at 
the age of 20 he said that watching executioners as they 
beheaded criminals publicly after friday prayer sessions became his 
favorite hobby 
he later applied for the job of sayyaf which carried a salary 
of 36 a month plus an additional 133 for each head 
alsayyaf said he carried out his first execution at age 23 
beheading three criminals and earning 1500 riyals 399 
i always look forward to the opportunity to chop off more heads 
so that i can earn more money he said 
over a period of time it became a very easy sort of job in 
fact i felt it was easy to do an execution he added i have 
chopped off the heads of more than 600 criminals and cut off 60 
hands of thieves 
alsayyaf said he first slices off the upper part of a convicts 
shirt with his sword to expose the kneeling victims neck then he 
uses a single swift stroke that sends blood gushing and the head 
rolling on the sand 
but he uses a pistol for executing women in order to avoid having 
to cut off their clothing and reveal naked flesh 
alsayyaf admits that he often has sleepless nights before 
executions worrying that i might fail 
but once the beheading is over he feels delighted and 
satisfied for having put an end to whats against the law of 
god 
i was very happy when i executed a drug trafficker almedina 
quoted him as saying 
these days those awaiting execution have their eyes covered by a 
black blindfold 
that was introduced after i chopped off the head of one convict 
and it fell directly in front of the second who suddenly collapsed 
and fell to the ground and died of a heart attack 
his most memorable executions took place in 1979 when he 
beheaded 12 convicts in one session they were all members of a 
group of moslem fundamentalists who seized the grand mosque in 
mecca islams holiest shrine in an attempt to topple the 
government 
alsayyaf has married 24 times and fathered 25 sons and 
daughters under islam a man is permitted four wives 
he says his grim job doesnt affect his social life 
alsayyaf has been training one of his sons mohammed to be his 
successor 
i have not yet given mohammed the opportunity to carry out an 
execution but i do feel that he knows the job he said a number 
of my relatives are reluctant at the thought of my training them

at least three people were killed and more than 50 
injured in the soviet republic of kazakhstan in brawling arson and 
rioting spawned by ethnic and economic problems a government 
spokesman said today 
hundreds of interior ministry soldiers and extra police were sent 
to novy uzen a city of 55000 people near the caspian sea and a 
curfew was imposed to restore order interior ministry spokesman 
boris mikhailov told a news briefing 
it was the third instance in six weeks in the vast central asian 
region in which ethnic tension and economic frustration have spilled 
over into violence 
in the worst violence about 100 people were killed in 
neighboring republic of uzbekistan this month 
the region is being buffeted by a rapidly increasing population 
pollution a lack of jobs an increase in ethnic divisions and a 
resurgence of islam 
a man who answered the telephone at an emergency headquarters set 
up in novy uzen said a 9 pm6 am curfew had been imposed the 
man who identified himself only as murzagalev said there had been 
a demonstration today but refused to elaborate 
mikhailov said since the violence began friday night three 
people had died and 53 were hurt he did not identify the dead or 
injured or say how they died 
fiftyseven people were arrested he said 
the spokesman said much of the violence appeared to be aimed at 
traders from the caucasus mountain region located on the opposite 
side of the caspian sea 
armenians georgians and azerbaijanis are the main ethnic groups 
in the caucasus but mikhailov said he did not know what group was 
targeted 
more than 700 of them mostly women and children were evacuated 
from novy uzen he said 
theyre now under heavy guard at a bus station 14 kilometers 
85 miles from the city and the roads to the station are 
blocked he said 
mikhailov said about 7000 people gathered monday in the towns 
main square demanding that cooperative businesses be closed and 
people from the caucasus republics be sent home 
two battalions of interior soldiers were brought in to stop the 
unrest mikhailov said the crowd was dispersed but it broke 
into several large groups of youths armed with pipes and stones and 
other objects they went along the streets organizing brawls 
pogroms and arson 
reports on monday said youths had tried unsuccessfully to seize a 
police station and that they were armed with guns and gasoline 
bombs 
cooperatives are privately owned businesses that have been 
permitted under president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms to 
provide an alternative to the staterun economy 
but many soviets suspect cooperative owners of profiteering and 
serving as a front for organized crime 
in uzbekistan officials have blamed the violence on outside 
instigators but members of the uzbek majority and meskhi turk 
minority the target of most of the violence have said overcrowding 
and unemployment contributed to it 
more than 10000 meskhi turks were evacuated from cities in 
uzbekistans fergana valley to a refugee camp as a protective 
measure 
authorities on monday announced a program to create 200000 jobs 
reduce pollution and diversify agriculture which is now based on 
cotton production in an effort to reduce tensions in uzbekistan 
in turkmenia a republic south of kazakhstan mobs rampaged 
through the streets in early may with demands that cooperatives be 
closed and armenian traders be forced to leave the area 
the first outbreak of ethnic violence under gorbachev was in alma 
ata the kazakhstan capital in december 1986 rioters burned 
vehicles and shops to protest the replacement of the republic 
communist party chief a kazakh with an ethnic russian

the illinois supreme court has struck 
down a law allowing videotaped testimony by child victims of sexual 
abuse 
the court monday declared the 1987 law unconstitutional because 
it deprives the accused of the right to confront their accusers at 
trial 
the law enacted by the legislature over gov james r thompsons 
veto allows the defense to crossexamine the child witness about 
the videotaped testimony during the trial but not during the taping 
itself 
crossexamination often depends for its effectiveness on the 
ability of counsel to punch holes in a witness testimony at just 
the right time in just the right way said justice john stamos 
citing a 1988 us supreme court ruling in a case from iowa 
illinois is one of several states that have adopted socalled 
child shield laws intended to protect young victims of sexual 
abuse from the trauma of testifying in open court and to minimize 
their fright and confusion 
the law applied only to certain sexual offenses committed against 
a child 12 or younger but in declaring it unconstitutional the 
justices said they were worried it would be expanded to include the 
elderly or handicapped 
in vetoing it the governor predicted it would be declared 
unconstitutional 
last year the us supreme court overturned the conviction of an 
iowa man who was made to testify behind a oneway screen to prevent 
his accusers from seeing him he had been found guilty of molesting 
two 13yearold girls 
the high court said the mans rights to a fair trial and to 
confront his accusers appeared to have been violated

conservative leader constantine mitsotakis 
today was given three days to form a new government and a leftist 
alliance rejected his offer to join a coalition 
mitsotakis centerright new democracy party finished first in 
sundays elections defeating premier andreas papandreous 
panhellenic socialist movement but new democracy failed to win a 
majority needed to govern 
president christos sartzetakison as outlined by the 
constitution today gave mitsotakis three days to form a governing 
coalition if he is unable to form a government papandreous party 
will be given the same opportunity 
the coalition of left and progress a leftistcommunist coalition 
that finished third said it would consider a governing coalition 
with papandreous party if the premier resigned as party leader but 
the leftists rejected an offer from mitsotakis to form a new 
government 
mitsotakis refused to say what he planned to do following the 
rejection of his coalition offer 
if neither of the top two finishers in the election can form a 
government the president will ask the third place coalition of left 
and progress to form a government 
if all three fail the president appoints a caretaker government 
to prepare for new elections 
the panhellenic socialist movement has hinted it would seek to 
lead a leftist coalition if it was offered the exploratory mandate 
new democracy gained 4437 percent of sundays vote and 144 
seats seven short of a majority in the 300member parliament 
papandreous party took 39 percent and 125 seats the coalition of 
left and progress an alliance of communist and greek left parties 
received 13 percent and 29 seats 
on monday mitstotakis asked the leftist alliance to join him in 
an interim government with a limited mandate confined to cleaning up 
the financial scandals that have tainted the papandreou government 
mitsotakis said the partnership would last only a few months 
until those guilty of involvement in the scandals were punished 
then he would call new elections 
i hope that all other parties will do all in their power to 
prevent the scandals from being written off mitsotakis said 
but harilaos florakis the leader of the greek communist party 
and president of the leftist alliance said his group wants to form 
a leftist government that would exclude people tainted by scandal 
florakis said it would consider forming a government with the 
panhellenic socialist movement if papandreou who has ruled since 
1981 resigned as its leader 
papandreou and senior members of his party have been accused of 
being involved in the 200 million fraud forgery and embezzlement 
scheme at the bank of crete george koskotas the owner of the bank 
is detained in prison in the united states pending the hearing of an 
extradition request by the greek government 
the socialsts have also been accused of widespread corruption and 
of involvement in a series of arms scandals

us industrial plants are spewing 360 million 
pounds of suspected cancercausing chemicals into the air annually 
with releases from each of the 30 biggest polluters exceeding 1 
million pounds according to government statistics 
the pollution figures were released monday by a private 
environmental group and confirmed by the environmental protection 
agency which provided the raw statistics based on information 
provided by industry under a fledgling public disclosure law 
industries are using the sky as a garbage dump to dispose of 
hundreds of millions of pounds of unregulated cancercausing 
chemicals said deborah sheiman author of the report from the 
natural resources defense council 
the nrdc identified more than 1500 companies in 46 states that 
release substantial amounts of at least one of 13 cancercausing 
chemicals into the air thirty of the companies reported releasing 
more than 1 million pounds of a particular carcinogen and several 
had releases five to nine times that amount the group said 
while the epa did not challenge the statistics it stopped short 
of attempting to estimate the health risks posed by such releases 
charles elkins director of the epas toxics programs said the 
raw figures cannot measure individuals health risks because they do 
not take into account exposure levels 
a spokesman for one of the companies cited boeing military 
airplanes of wichita kan said that while the companys kansas 
plant releases 23 million pounds of trichloroethylene the releases 
are so diluted the chemical is undetectable in the air 
the spokesman richard hill said boeing nevertheless is trying 
to develop a substitute for the chemical 
the boeing plant ranked ninth among the biggest polluters cited 
in the nrdc report the most releases of any of the 13 carcinogens 
examined came from the plants of eastman kodak co in rochester 
ny the company reported 89 million pounds of methylene chloride 
were released during 1987 according to the epa figures 
other companies which reported emissions of more than 25 million 
pounds of the chemical which the epa has classified as a probable 
human carcinogen were ge plastics of mount vernon ind the 
upjohn co portage mich eli lilly amp co clinton and shadeland 
ind and hadco corp derry nh 
peter maas an upjohn spokesman said today that the 
pharmaceutical company is more than halfway toward its selfimposed 
goal of cutting its 5 million pounds of emissions in half by the end 
of 1989 
air sampling around the plants perimeter in 1987 found no 
detectable levels of methylene chloride and within the plant the 
chemical remains well below dangerous levels he said 
david doniger an nrdc attorney acknowledged that the raw 
figures provide no assessment of health risk to residents near the 
plants but maintained these pollutants have to be considered 
dangerous at any level of exposure 
only one of the 13 chemicals benzene is subject to any epa 
regulation covering routine industrial releases the chemicals are 
among the long list of toxic substances for which regulations are 
being developed 
in a separate development monday the epa made public new details 
about the release of the many toxic industrial pollutants not only 
carcinogens into the air providing for the first time a list of 
counties where such releases are greatest 
the agency said 68 million pounds of hazardous chemicals are 
released into the air in 1987 in tooele county utah more than in 
any other county in the country the releases were attributed to 
amax magnesium in rowley utah 
other county hotspots for toxic industrial air pollution with 
more than 45 million tons of hazardous chemical released were warren 
county in virginia mobile county in alabama and ascension county in 
louisiana 
the nrdc findings mirror many of the conclusions reached earlier 
this month by rep henry waxman dcalif after the congressman 
compiled estimates on the release of carcinogens at industrial 
plants from figures dating back to the early 1980s 
but while waxmans data from the epa were based on rough 
working estimates the latest figures were based on actual release 
numbers provided by the companies involved under a public disclosure 
law that went into effect last year 
among the findings of the nrdc in its analysis of the epas 
statistics were 
at least 1600 industrial plants and facilities in 46 states 
release significant amounts of suspected cancercausing chemicals 
into the air 
releases of 400000 pounds or more were reported by 125 plants 
including 30 that reported 1 million pounds or more 
the most common chemical among the 13 examined was methylene 
chloride used as a metal degreaser paint remover and in aerosols 
it was cited at 18 of the 30 plants where releases exceeded 1 
million pounds 
the top polluter for each of the other 12 chemicals was 
borgwarner chemical inc washington wva acrylonitrile 114 
million pounds texaco chemical co port neches texas 13 
butadiene 960000 pounds monsanto co soda spring idaho 
cadmium 100250 pounds

rocky flats want the government to cover the cost of testing their 
drinking water and stopping the flow of water from the weapons plant 
into their reservoirs 
officials from broomfield westminster thornton and northglenn 
met on monday with ed goldberg the department of energys top 
official at rocky flats to press their concerns the session was 
organized by us rep david skaggs 
local governments shouldnt suffer any additional costs from 
living downstream from rocky flats said skaggs a democrat 
goldberg noted that skaggs and his congressional colleagues have 
more say than he does over whether the suburbs get reimbursed 
we can ask and we will ask but its up to congress to 
appropriate the money in the end he said 
fears over the safety of the water surfaced earlier this month 
with a us justice department probe of alleged dumping of hazardous 
wastes at rocky flats 
walnut and woman creeks cross the site before entering the water 
supplies of more than a quartermillion residents 
tests by the state and the four suburbs found no detectable 
levels of pollutants in drinking water sources but the suburbs said 
they dont want to have to worry about the possibility of pollutants 
flowing their way 
broomfield is digging a ditch to take walnut creek water around a 
reservoir a diversion of woman creek is under study the creek 
flows into a lake that provides drinking water to westminster

bethlehem steel corp has agreed to spend 92 
million over five years to curb toxic releases from a plant that has 
piled up 150000 in pollution fines over the past year 
the agreement announced monday expands on a 152 million air 
pollution cleanup promised by the steelmaker in 1987 
officials said that the agreement the largest ever negotiated by 
the state with an industrial polluter is legally binding and that 
bethlehem could be fined more than 100000 for failing to maintain 
the cleanup schedule 
bethlehem steels sparrows point complex at baltimore harbor 
employs 8000 workers and produces steel for ships bridges 
buildings autos and appliances 
the plant is the thirdlargest source of cancercausing chemicals 
in maryland and one of the states leading industrial sources of 
sulfur dioxide emissions which have taken the principal blame for 
acid rain 
buoyed by its first profitable year since 1981 bethlehem pledged 
in 1987 to reduce emissions the new agreement calls for more 
extensive measures including a 40 million modernization of a 
chemical recovery plant to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and 
toxic pollutants mainly benzene and hydrogen cyanide 
benzene can cause leukemia and other cancers anemia and other 
health problems hydrogen cyanide can kill if inhaled in high 
concentrations 
bethlehem also promised to repair leaking walls and flues at a 
cost of 24 million to cut down on the black smoke belching from 
three smokestacks 
by 1994 the cleanup should result in reductions of 54 percent in 
particulates 67 percent in sulfur dioxide 50 percent in volatile 
organic compounds that create ozone and 30 percent in benzene

a school that has straddled the indianaohio 
border for nearly 100 years a center stripe in the gymnasium 
marking the state line must continue to accept students from both 
states a us magistrate said 
magistrate michael merz on monday blocked an attempt by indiana 
officials to close union school to ohio students and force them to 
attend another school miles from home 
merzs preliminary injunction forces the union county ind 
school corp to abide by a 1964 court order that bars it from 
altering operation of the school with the college corner ohio 
school board without consent of both boards 
while the joint operation may be cumbersome it is not 
impossibly so and has worked for almost 100 years merz wrote 
it is needed to provide a school for the children of college 
corner it is needed to uphold the obligation of defendants to obey 
their own solemn undertakings and the judgment of this court 
the school was built by the ohio and indiana districts so that 
children from either state could attend 
last week richard amick superintendent of the union county 
corporation said the indiana board has voted to sever its 
relationship with the college corner board because of conflicting 
state laws that jeopardize state money for indiana students he also 
cited a poor relationship with members of the college corner board 
about 280 indiana students attend union school comprising about 
75 percent of the enrollment 
college corner officials say that without the arrangement ohio 
pupils will be forced to attend school miles away because the 
community doesnt have enough students to operate its own school

phone paging companies their images bruised by 
drug dealers incessant use of beepers are bopping those beeped the 
most 
nynex said monday it will join other companies in levying a 
surcharge on customers who use their beepers an inordinate number of 
times often a tipoff theyre drug dealers 
its part of an industrywide reaction to the perception that 
the paging industry is tainted by the fact that a few bad guys are 
using pagers said michael vernetti spokesman for telocator a 
washingtonbased trade association 
dealers went hightech a few years ago to meet the high demand 
for crack authorities said now the beleaguered beeper has become a 
symbol of drug dealing a piece of electronic jewelry 
when police make a bust they often find guns cash drugs and 
beepers 
the pager is nothing but a tool the same tool that can reach a 
doctor and help save a persons life said don kilcoyne spokesman 
for nynex mobile communications 
the companies cant do much about those who buy or lease beepers 
except make an identification and credit check so theyre hitting 
drug dealers at the other end the monthly bill in the form of a 
surcharge 
we feel its had a positive effect said chris houpis 
marketing director of metromedia paging services which has charged 
1 per beep over 1000 a month since last fall 
metromedia said it will donate the surcharge to the target 
foundation a missouribased drugcounseling organization the 
amount wont be known until later this year houpis said 
starting aug 1 nynex will charge 50 cents per beep over 500 a 
month and 1 for each over 1000 allcity paging of tarzana calif 
also added a surcharge last year 
long island telephone may have started the trend 
way back in 87 our system was getting very crowded we had 
very heavy usage drug dealers naturally rose marie marchiel 
the companys sales coordinator said monday the company charged 15 
cents for each beep over 350 a month 
it did lighten it up again to where the other customers 
werent getting busy signals she said 
police say regular drug customers call the dealers number and 
punch in their number the dealer calls back and arrangements for a 
sale are made 
mrs marchiel said customers would come in with 25 pounds of 
gold jewelry the stereotype we cant accuse them of anything we 
saw more and more and their friends brought in friends 
the company figures the surcharge eliminated about 35 percent of 
the problem users customers involved in law enforcement and 
public health and safety are exempted from the surcharge she said 
will it hurt the dealers 
it might hurt some of the lowerlevel dealers but not the 
higherups said a new york city narcotics officer who spoke on 
the condition on anonymity they just wont pay their bill and 
get another beeper 
beepers have been banned in schools in several major cities 
including new york chicago detroit and baltimore in an attempt to 
keep schoolchildren from being involved in drug sales rep kweisi 
mfume dmd has introduced the beeper abuse prevention act which 
would restrict access to pagers to those under 21

president ranasinghe premadasa faced 
with increasing civil violence reimposed a nationwide state of 
emergency today less than six months after he had lifted it 
foreign and deputy defense minister ranjan wijeratne told 
parliament that premadasa had proclaimed the state of emergency to 
try to control unrest that is believed caused by sinhalese 
extremists 
the emergency which became effective immediately is to last for 
one month and then be extended by parliament every month 
emergency regulations give police and the military broad powers 
to arrest and hold suspects without warrants or other judicial 
requirements authorities also can dispose of bodies without 
inquests 
sinhalese extremists mostly belonging to the leftwing peoples 
liberation front are believed to have led a crippling 8dayold 
strike by workers of the stateowned public transport company 
the strike by 20000 workers of the sri lanka transport board has 
often turned violent and has forced more than 4000 buses off the 
road 
public services including transport have been paralyzed by 
forcing the workers to keep away from work wijeratne said 
strike sponsors have threatened private bus and taxi drivers and 
last week set ablaze 15 buses police said 
since it began an antigovernment campaign in 1987 the sinhalese 
front has been blamed for killing more than 3500 people most of 
whom were government officials or governing party activists 
wijeratne without naming the extremists said more than 1700 
people have been killed since january of whom 965 were politicians 
government officials and policemen 
there has been progressive escalation of violence acts of 
sabotage and disruption of essential services throughout the 
country he said under such a situation the government cannot 
look on inactively 
the sinhalese militants launched their antigovernment drive to 
protest peace overtures made to rebels of the tamil community who 
have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983 
the insurrection forced premadasas predecessor junius r 
jayewardene to declare a state of emergency in may 1983 premadasa 
lifted the emergency on jan 11 nine days after he took office in a 
bid to defuse ethnic tensions he had pledged it would not be 
imposed again 
the tamil separatist campaign has claimed 9000 lives tamils say 
they are discriminated against in jobs and education by the majority 
buddhist sinhalese 
tamils mostly hindus form 18 percent of sri lankas 16 million 
people the mainly buddhist sinhalese comprise 75 percent and 
control the government and the military

cities and states should look to tolls 
fees and lotteries to finance roads and bridges because of the 
federal governments budget problems transportation secretary 
samuel skinner told mayors today 
skinner told the us conference of mayors that local governments 
can no longer count on washington for most of its transportation 
investments 
he said lotteries toll roads and bridges user fees and fees 
charged to developers are new creative ways that state and 
local governments are turning to 
skinner said federal transportation grants will increasingly be 
awarded to areas that offer to put up more local money than the 20 
percent or 25 percent many federal programs require 
if you dont have 50 percent or better state and local 
participation that grant will be so far down the priority list 
it will not be reached he said 
on monday housing and urban development secretary jack kemp told 
the mayors he had taken partisanship out of funding decisions at his 
scandalridden department 
democrats and republicans need to read my lips its open to 
everybody on the basis of need as opposed to greed as it existed in 
the past kemp told the us conference of mayors on monday 
i will clean it up i will clean it out 
the more than 200 mayors from both parties were continuing their 
fiveday meeting today with appearances by more bush administration 
officials and democratic national chairman ron brown the conference 
concludes wednesday 
environmental protection agency chief william k reilly also was 
scheduled to appear today 
in prepared remarks reilly urged support for president bushs 
clean air act proposal and said merely offering it was an act of 
great political courage 
the president is walking headon into one of our thorniest 
political briar patches reilly said 
bushs proposal is aimed at breaking a decadelong congressional 
stalemate that has blocked enactment of tougher federal clean air 
laws it calls for a 50 percent 10 million ton reduction in sulfur 
dioxide emissions a chief cause of acid rain from coal burning 
power plants other measures are aimed at smog and ozone problems 
including a phasein of cars powered by methanol 
the proposal marks a break from the reagan administration which 
did not acknowledge acid rain as an environmental concern and 
opposed tougher laws to curb smog 
kemp was greeted warmly in contrast to an earlier appearance by 
republican national chairman lee atwater atwaters sharply partisan 
remarks including his pledge to work actively for gop mayoral 
candidates and reference to the mayors as the farm team of the 
party drew complaints from mayors in both parties 
kemp repeated his recent promise to crack down on mismanagement 
and fraud in the department and eliminate political influence from 
decisionmaking on federal grants hud has been beset by a series of 
scandals including the embezzlement of millions of dollars and 
charges that wellconnected republicans used influence peddling to 
steer the awarding of hud grants 
he said reforms would not interfere with his goals including 
establishing urban enterprise zones that are aimed at luring jobs to 
the ghettos allowing public housing tenants to manage and purchase 
their residences and fighting drugs 
kemp declined however to say whether former hud secretary 
samuel pierce who served throughout the reagan administration must 
shoulder blame for the problems being uncovered 
im not going to make a political judgment about any past 
secretary because i think its unseemly of me he said 
kemp said he was confident i understand the scope of the 
scandals at hud 
i dont think its as bad as the critics say i dont think 
its as good as i want it to be he said

carl loe watched his spearfishing partner 
shoot a 150pound shark and then felt the heavy jaws of a second 
shark clamp onto his leg 
when i turned and looked there was nothing but teeth embedded 
in my leg the 45yearold furniture retailer said monday from 
ochsner foundation hospitals where he has been hospitalized since 
saturday 
loe of slidell was more than 100 feet underwater in the gulf of 
mexico and 40 miles off the coast at cocodrie southwest of new 
orleans when the 6foot shark attacked 
loe said he spotted a sand tiger shark and swam out of the way to 
let his partner arthur bukasky get off a shot with his speargun 
that shark fled pulling bukasky away and then loe was attacked 
by another 6foot sand tiger 
he felt and saw the sharks jaws open and close again mauling 
his right leg and cutting his left 
my only reaction was to punch him in the nose and get him 
off said loe 
he slammed the butt of his speargun into the sharks nose until 
it let go then he swam to the surface where carl loe iii 15 
worked to stop the bleeding and radioed for help 
a helicopter took loe from the boat to ochsner 
loe said his leg was punctured and cut in dozens of places but 
doctors tell him he should recover fully

hollywood hopefuls duped into sending 
photographs to a prison will get them back along with a letter of 
apology from the inmate who conducted a movierecruitment scheme 
from his cell a prison investigator said 
the scheme came to light two weeks ago when authorities in 
southwest alabama warned residents that telephone calls about a 
possible filming by paramount pictures were untrue 
the calls were made by inmate james mills said bill dury a 
prison investigator at staunton correctional center in staunton va 
mills 29 is serving nine years there for attempted larceny 
he admitted the whole thing dury said in a telephone 
interview monday i think it was kind of an egosatisfying thing 
to have these beautiful young women sending photographs to him 
mills called high school students in alabama west virginia 
south carolina and arizona about being in a movie dury said 
inmates routinely are allowed only collect phone calls dury 
declined to say how mills bypassed the prisons phone system 
the hollywood hopefuls mailed photos of themselves to mills who 
used several aliases dury said a search of his cell last week 
recovered 15 or 20 photos from six or seven people none of the 
subjects was nude 
mills had tried however to obtain nude photos of students 
mobile county investigators said last week 
dury said there was no evidence that mills was selling or trading 
the photos he described the photos as portraittype pictures from 
high school 
one family did send photographs in bikinis it appeared to be 
an older woman and two young girls dury said 
no charges were immediately filed against mills dury said 
mobile county authorities asked federal officials to investigate 
since the scheme crossed state lines

yellowstone has added an 
exhibit on the devastating fires of 1988 intended to help visitors 
drive through the parks charred areas as well as the unscarred 
half with more understanding 
i hope people will learn enough to have a choice of what they 
think said betty knight a park naturalist they still might be 
mad but thats their choice 
knight directed planning and construction of the exhibit which 
opened saturday in the visitors center at grant village 
the 136000 production was an unusual crash program for the 
national park service which usually requires at least two years of 
planning on a major exhibit she said 
the motivation was an unprecedented public interest knight said 
it was a vietnam of forest fires she said it was the 
first time fire was brought into peoples living rooms on a steady 
basis 
the exhibit she said shows the shortterm effects of the fires 
from five to 25 years from now and explores the longrange future 
of yellowstone 
the causes drought lightning storms the parks geography 
are explained as well as recent history of fire supression that 
contributed to the buildup of fuel 
the exhibit includes murals portraits of firefighters a video 
recouting the fury of the fires and presentations about animals 
grant village survived a seige of fire in late july although 
fastrunning flames came within feet of staff dormitories now the 
area is an almost surreal scene blackened trees interspersed with 
orange lodgepole pines that are dead but still have their needles 
except in the badly charred stands there is a lush carpet of 
green grass growing through the soot and ash and to the north and 
east around yellowstone lake there is no evidence of the fires 
that swept through half the 22 million acre park 
knight 44 typifies those who believe the fires were in 
historical terms good for the countrys first national park with 
longterm benefits for vegetation and wildlife 
the exhibit does not however address the decision to allow many 
fires to burn naturally until late july or refer to disputes 
between firefighters and park rangers that hampered some efforts to 
quell the flames until it was too late 
were not touching policy said knight who has been with the 
park service for 22 years were trying to get across that all of 
yellowstone is not the same that it wont recover the same 
the exhibit she coordinated will take most visitors about 20 
minutes to tour although knight said there is enough information 
available for extremely interested tourists to spend more than two 
hours 
design costs ran 16000 and production 120000 knight said 
not including the salaries and overtime required 
the exhibit closes with writings by bob marshall a 
conservationist who remarked in 1927 that in fireblackened forests 
there were some scenes of desolation that pretty nearly drive an 
unimaginative person crazy 
marshall concluded that an optimist could go surging through 
that blackened misshapened world rejoicing because the forest will 
look just as beautiful as before in two or three centuries 
knight like most other park employees takes marshalls view 
its always a changing park she said it wasnt the same 
park in 1988 as it was in 1953 when i first saw it 
the difference obviously is that this change is much more 
dramatic

reputation

dystrophy and other causes bush said you may be to some the bad 
side of basketball but off the court people see the kinder gentler 
side of the detroit pistons

with an exuberance matched only by the 
novelty of their new democratic parliamentary elections poles 
plastered campaign posters across the country over the last month 
now the time has come to pay the price of pluralism cleaning up 
with the signs of polands fledgling venture into free elections 
looking a bit tattered the question remains who should scrub 
scrape and wash away the campaign posters and who should pay for it 
an estimated 700000 posters went up in warsaw alone in an 
astounding display of uncensored campaigning unseen in poland during 
45 years of communist rule 
that represented about 40 tons of paper a significant amount in 
a country where university students sometimes dont have anything 
suitable on which to type their theses 
most of the posters came from the independent solidarity 
movement which went on to win all but one of the 261 seats 
available to opposition candidates and hand the government a 
stinging rebuke in two rounds of voting that started june 4 and 
ended sunday 
now however the posters such as those featuring gallant gary 
cooper in cowboy gear and a solidarity button that says high noon 
is june 4 are peeling off apartment block walls 
rain has smeared the sentiments of support for a communist 
coalition candidate whose banner hung along a main city thoroughfare 
the emotions subsided the litter remained who is going to 
clean it up asked the daily solidarity newspaper 
jan litynski head of the solidarity campaign in warsaw promised 
in the article that the union would work on the cleanup with city 
authorities 
but we do not have the money to hire people we have only 
debts litynski said so those who were putting up the posters 
for free now will to clean them off too 
another issue of the newspaper carried a call from 12yearold 
mikolaj bober who put up posters all over the zoliborz section of 
warsaw 
we have to clean it up he said i am eager to do this 
and i count on the help of other boys and girls 
the director of the warsaw municipal cleaning enterprise leszek 
swierczynski said the city will clean the sites it administers but 
building janitors the bus and tramway services and others will have 
to take care of their areas 
there is quite a lot to do and the whole cleanup campaign 
will surely take a lot of extra money said swierczynski making 
it clear that the expenses of westernstyle electioneering were not 
anticipated in his departments budget 
the scale of the poster phenomenon in warsaw is 
extraordinary he added

wednesday is the summer solstice the longest 
day of the year in the northern hemisphere 
the solstice occurs at 553 am edt according to astronomers at 
the us naval observatory here the moment marks the time during 
the summer when the sun is farthest from the equator 
the date known in folklore as midsummer had been a time for 
parties and frivolity to celebrate the season 
listing the date as the start of summer has become a popular 
convention among calendar makers in recent years but the 
designation carries no official weight meteorologists for example 
consider summer to have begun june 1

former rep pat swindall was convicted of nine 
counts of perjury today for lying to a federal grand jury about a 
moneylaundering scheme 
the 38yearold republican who served two terms in congress from 
atlantas suburbs before being defeated in november could receive 
up to five years in prison plus fines of 250000 on each count at 
sentencing aug 25 
the jury deliberated 17 hours over four days after nearly four 
weeks of testimony swindall was indicted in october on 10 counts of 
perjury us district judge richard c freeman dismissed one count 
during the trial 
the former congressman was accused of lying to a grand jury in 
1988 about his 1987 negotiations with an irs agent posing as a 
drugmoney launderer and with swindall associate charles lechasney 
later convicted of money laundering 
among other things swindall was found guilty of perjury for 
denying that he had been told that the 850000 he was seeking from 
the agent to finish building his luxurious home contained proceeds 
from drug trafficking 
swindall looked on impassively as the verdict was read his 
wifes hand on his back 
at a news conference he said he was confident he would be 
vindicated on appeal not vindicated in the sense that i did no 
wrong but vindicated in the sense that i never perjured myself 
before the grand jury 
his chief attorney richard hendrix said swindall who did not 
take the stand at trial will appeal 
us attorney robert barr said the jury has very obviously 
spoken today swindall violated the integrity of the grand 
jury process 
swindall a lanky boyish lawyer went to congress in 1984 from 
the citys affluent eastern suburbs as a conservative 
fundamentalist christian under the cloud of the perjury indictment 
he lost to democrat ben jones a former tv actor from the dukes of 
hazzard 
the jury heard secretly taped conversations with the undercover 
agent mike mullaney in which swindall was told that the 850000 
certainly included drug money and that he would be part of an 
operation to wash cash swindall proposed that a mortgage 
company be set up by lechasney as a buffer to allow him to 
borrow the agents money 
in their last conversation after swindall had received a 
150000 advance he told mullaney if charles wants to launder 
yalls money fine but i cant do that i can borrow the money 
from charles 
later swindall told a federal grand jury he was never 
satisfied with respect to the deals criminality and knew 
almost nothing about lechasneys mortgage company 
the deal never was completed swindall was to have received 
850000 in exchange for a 1 million promissory note 
swindalls lawyers insisted that he had been duped by a man he 
assumed was his friend lechasney whom they labeled a 
sociopathic liar and master manipulator who assured swindall 
that the deal was ok 
hendrix said the former congressman was guilty of stupidity 
but not perjury he said swindall was fatigued at the time of his 
grand jury testimony and tried faithfully to recall details from 
months gone by 
he never laundered a dime he did the best he could when he got 
in front of the grand jury hendrix said 
but prosecutor cragi gillen scoffed at the i dont remember 
and i dont recall phrases that peppered swindalls grand jury 
testimony 
do you think you would remember gillen asked the jury if 
you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal and he 
tells you narcotics dollars are involved what he does violates 
currency laws 
do you think you could ever forget 
the prosecution called a surprise witness moneylaundering 
conspirator kirk smith who testified that swindall had told him 
last fall before the congressman was indicted how he planned to 
beat the perjury rap 
smith recalled he looked at me and said kirk im a lawyer 
in front of the grand jury i used phrases like i dont remember 
and i cant recall they cant convict me for having a bad 
memory 
swindall was a largely unknown lawyer and furniture store owner 
when he was elected in an upset in 1984 toppling veteran democrat 
elliott levitas 
swindall a presbyterian took his campaign to evangelical 
churches distributing a biblical scorecard in his race against 
levitas who is jewish 
in his two terms swindall staunchly voted with the reagan right 
and acquired a reputation as somewhat of a gadfly voting against 
such popular programs as school lunch funding and aid to african 
famine victims he filed a brief with the supreme court advocating 
the teaching of creationism in schools 
after his indictment swindall hoped to clear his name by 
election day with an immediate trial but the effort collapsed after 
jurors received swindall campaign mail proclaiming his innocence 
the judge aborted the trial 
two weeks later jones won by 20 percentage points

new yorks education commissioner today 
canceled statewide chemistry exams for 80000 high school students 
after the new york post citing widespread thefts of the test 
published a stolen answer sheet 
commissioner thomas sobol described the posts move as beneath 
contempt 
attorney general robert abrams office said it was investigating 
the theft of two exams in new york city and looking into reports 
that copies of them were being sold for as much as 2000 to groups 
of students who split the cost 
the new york board of regents sponsors 17 exams on different 
subjects which it distributed to high schools in padlocked safes 
for administering june 1522 
the exams are crucial for many students to graduate from high 
school without attending summer school and to get a diploma 
acceptable to colleges 
the post reported that so many stolen tests were circulating it 
took the newspaper just 15 minutes and two phone calls to obtain a 
copy of the chemistry answer sheet 
the tabloid printed the 56 answers on its front page explaining 
the post is publishing it only after learning that thousands of 
answer sheets have been photocopied by and distributed to high 
school students illegally 
post editor jerry nachman did not immediately return a telephone 
call today 
sobols spokeswoman linda fisher said a new chemistry exam will 
be offered aug 17 and the state also will grant students credit

child care will be a significant issue in the 
1990 congressional campaign and republican chances could be damaged 
if child care and parentalleave legislation is vetoed by president 
bush gop and democratic political strategists said tuesday 
vince breglio a republican consultant who was pollster for the 
bush campaign in 1988 and is a former director of the republican 
senate campaign committee said i dont believe serious political 
candidates in 1990 can avoid discussing the issue of child care i 
dont believe they can avoid discussing the issue of longterm 
health care 
breglio said he did not believe parental leave would be an issue 
because in terms of an issue you have to have clearcut 
differences it is very hard for me to imagine two candidates going 
at each other over the issue of parental leave 
celinda lake a democratic consultant argued that work and 
family issues including child care parental leave and longterm 
health care have emerged as major policy issues in 1990 
the president has vetoed the minimum wage ms lake said 
there is some possibility of a veto of parental leave and child 
care if those three vetos come down that is a definite statement 
of the republicans position on work and family issues and it is up 
to the democrats to take those voting records into the district and 
make those the issues that decide elections 
the two consultants appeared on a panel sponsored by the child 
care action campaign the great american family tour and lifetime 
television which discussed results of a poll published by several 
magazines in february in which 74 percent of those responding said 
family issues should be a top priority for the president and 
congress 
breglio asked by a member of the audience about the effects of a 
series of presidential vetos said i think any time you are seen 
as a naysayer that you have nothing positive to offer in the 
debate you have a problem with voters of either gender 
if programs have particular importance to women and you are 
vetoing a series of programs i think the cumulative effect of 
that could have more impact than say a single program and 
certainly that is one thing we would be watching he said 
breglio said the most recent white house poll indicates about 5 
to 6 percent more support for bushs child care program based on a 
tax credit than for a program being considered in congress that 
would involve direct government funding 
so far george bush is doing pretty well with women he said 
the numbers look very good now if there is a whole series of 
vetos on legislation that is of particular importance to women that 
could be a different ball game

the united states has urged china to grant 
clemency to demonstrators sentenced to death in beijing and shanghai 
and to pardon those who were arrested in prodemocracy protests the 
white house said today 
sentences of death in shanghai and beijing could only deepen 
the wounds of the past few weeks said white house press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
he declined to say what if any steps the united states might 
take if china goes ahead with executions 
the white house announcement came on the heels of demands in 
congress and elsewhere that the united states intensify its 
condemnation of chinese repression and consider further sanctions 
against the beijing government 
fitzwater said chinas ambassador to the united states han xu 
was called to the state department monday night to hear what the 
spokesman called the strong united states position 
hinting at worsening relations between beijing and washington 
fitzwater said the united states raised this subject in the spirit 
of a country that has worked with china over the past two decades to 
improve relations 
we believe that human rights are universal and our duty to 
comment on them is great fitzwater said 
we urge the leaders of the peoples republic of china to show 
clemency and to use their powers to pardon those who were arrested 
in the demonstrations for democracy fitzwater said 
human rights are an important principle by which the united 
states judges its relations with all countries in the world he

strongly supports reform in the communist world and accused soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev of dodging the china issue 
to stand in the way of such necessary historic changes as we 
are seeing to our outrage and sorrow in china is to turn ones

although the administration is trying to keep americans from 
returning to china only military transactions with beijing have 
been suspended by bush 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash and other lawmakers have 
called on bush to consider other punitive measures and also step up 
us condemnation of the chinese government 
at a news conference almost two weeks ago bush rejected the 
suggestion of more sanctions against china saying the halt of 
weapons sales went far enough under present circumstances i think 
that the position we took aiming not at the chinese people but at 
the military arrangements was wellreceived around the world and 
was followed by many countries right after we did that he said 
chinese dissident fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian took 
refuge june 4 at the us embassy in beijing shortly after the 
military crushed prodemocracy protests 
fang has led chinese intellectuals in calling for release of 
political prisoners and asserting that economic and scientific 
progress is impossible without protections for free thought he was 
also angered the chinese by saying marxism is dead 
state department spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler said monday 
american workers are being advised strongly not to return to jobs in 
china were not going to lift our travel advisory that remains 
in effect she said 
the advisory which is a suggestion and not an order was 
posted after chinese army troops attacked students demonstrating for 
a more liberal regime june 34 in tiananmen square 
thousands of americans subsequently left china some with us 
assistance thereby stripping us companies of many of their key 
personnel 
about 175 american companies have offices in china many of them 
have received word from their chinese partners in joint ventures 
reporting that the turmoil has subsided 
ms tutwiler said that despite a pause in antius propaganda 
over the weekend the situation in china remains far from 
normal 
she said criticism of the voice of america resumed on saturday 
and that articles had appeared attacking expelled voa bureau chief 
alan pessin and associated press correspondent john pomfret 
on sunday the official new china news agency said fitzwaters 
criticism of death sentences imposed on three chinese for burning a 
train was ridiculous

the building that twice has defied 
explosions to fell it now is being immortalized in three tshirt 
designs and their creators are in a spat over whose brainstorm the 
shirt idea was 
one depicts the leaning tower of providence another the 
leaning tower of bilray for the construction company that pulled 
the booboo and the hartford park horror project sponsored by 
republicans who want to make political capital from the snafu 
bilray contracted by the providence housing authority tried 
twice on may 21 to implode the hartford park housing project and 
succeeded only in knocking out one floor leaving the lshaped 
building leaning on itself 
the company has since been working at taking the building down 
with a traditional wrecking ball 
state gop chairman michael vallante came out with the republican 
tshirt on monday but he says he had the idea all along but just 
got sidetracked about getting the shirts made up 
the housing authority sold out its first 100 shirts thursday and 
says it has 300 more going on sale tuesday with a price increase 
from 4 to 6 
when bilray groused they already had 9 shirts for sale stephen 
orourke the authoritys director said he was the one who came up 
with the phrase leaning tower of bilray the day the implosion 
failed 
what does he want to do sue us orourke said i mean this 
is not one of those things that is high up on my agenda 
vallante said the gop would offer to eventually add the total 
cost of the project to the back of its 5 shirts 
the people of providence have a right to know what is the cost 
in extra security the costs for safety the cost of the lost 
business in the area for this tower that is a testament to 
incompetence vallante said

be served for breakfast on his arctic cruise was vodka 
ludwig had gone to bed early monday night leaving his wife to 
enjoy a cabaret evening aboard the soviet cruise liner maxim gorky

icebergs 
i was in bed when suddenly there was a terrible crash that 
almost shook me out of bed said ludwig one of more than 950 
passengers and crew aboard the vessel when it struck an iceberg 
obeying instructions from the ships loudspeakers the 
67yearold west german pensioner with a walking disability pulled 
on his trousers put on his life vest and went on deck to stand by a 
lifeboat 
the liner on a cruise out of bremerhaven west germany struck 
the iceberg about 300 miles east of northern greenland no injuries 
were reported 
we are all safe and sound here ludwig said in a telephone 
interview from a church on the norwegian island of svalbard where 
passengers were taken by ship and helicopter after the accident 
ludwig said he had just heard that his wife was safe and coming 
to join him they were being taken home to wiesbaden as soon as the 
rescue operation was complete he said 
he seemed in good spirits joking im standing here in my 
pajamas and the trousers keep wanting to fall down to my knees 
for a while though there was nothing to laugh about 
when i got up on deck i saw enormous ice blocks around we 
were told to get into the lifeboats he said adding that there 
was no panic 
we sat for five hours among the icebergs the atmosphere was 
calm and the russian sailors did everything they could they gave 
us vodka and whiskey in the boats since it was cold said ludwig 
and blankets too 
temperatures in the area were about 38 degrees 
from the lifeboats we could see that a third of the ship was 
under water he said ludwig said that the ship appeared to be 
moving fast through the icy waters before the crash there was a 
slight fog but not enough to impair vision he said 
the norwegian coast guard vessel senja reached the stricken ship 
early tuesday and picked up hundreds of passengers who had jumped 
into lifeboats or scrambled onto ice floes said kjell larssen of 
the north norway rescue center at bodoe others were rescued by 
helicopter from the ship or ice floes 
my wife will get here in a while he said theyve gotten 
blankets and stuff together so that people can spend the night i

said she agreed to it in hopes of helping others who may need the 
operation

representative from haddonfield nj who had suffered from back 
pain for more than half her life the surgery took place on public 
television monday night 
the 2hour operation to help correct a 50degree curvature of 
mrs arizins spine is expected to make the 5foot9inch patient an 
inch and a half taller 
its really kind of surprising but the focus is the surgery 
and the new technique and how it can help other patients mrs 
arizin said i agreed in the hope that it would help other people 
who are going through the same thing 
whyy said it broadcast the operation live for its impact and 
educational value

its really like without editing said station manager david 
othmer 
whyy spokeswoman tina brock today said the station received at 
least 330 calls its highest ever for one show she said viewers 
called the program absolutely breathtaking and magnificent

percent share against the network lineup which began at 8 pm with 
kate amp allie on cbs alf on nbc and macgyver in abc the 
rating is percentage of all homes with television the share a 
percentage of televisions in use 
dr richard rothman founder of pennsylvania hospitals rothman

stainless steel rods were attached to the vertebrae to nearly 
straighten mrs arizins spine bone was then grafted onto the rods 
to hold them in place 
the surgery used to take six to seven hours it now takes two 
to four hours balderston said patients used to be in bed for 
as long as six months now theyre out of bed in one or two days

a political crisis and new elections loomed 
tuesday as conservative leader constantine mitsotakis was given 
three days to form a government but was rejected by a possible 
leftwing coalition partner 
both mitsotakiss new democracy party and the communistdominated 
leftist alliance who together won nearly 60 percent of sundays 
vote say a new government first must punish those responsible for 
the scandals of the defeated socialist administration of premier 
andreas papandreou 
but the alliance of the prosoviet greek communist party and the 
greek left party which finished third turned down mitsotakis 
offer to join in an interim government that would investigate the 
corruption 
the alliance also refuses to cooperate with papandreou making 
the possibility of new elections likely and paralyzing parliament 
which cannot order an inquiry if the political parties cannot form a 
government 
mitsotakis said papandreou cannot keep making national decisions 
and demanded the replacement within 24 hours of officials appointed 
by papandreou including the governors of greeces 56 provinces the 
heads of state organizations including radio and television and 
the secret service 
i can assure you there will be catharsis mitsotakis told a 
news conference after president christos sartzetakis gave him the 
mandate to form a government 
a solution has to be found as soon as possible to allow 
parliament to investigate the scandals and to initiate 
prosecutions he added 
mitsotakis who finished first with 4429 percent of the vote and 
144 of parliaments 300 seats did not indicate how he might 
overcome the leftists refusal to join him in a coalition 
if mitsotakis fails to form a government within three days the 
president will ask papandreou and the leftist alliance in turn to 
try 
mitsotakis clarified his coalition offer would only last a few 
months and would focus on investigating and prosecuting corruption 
following that then we will go to new elections which will 
provide the political solution which these elections did not 
mitsotakis added 
under the constitution papandreou continues as caretaker premier 
until there is a new government or new elections are held 
mitsotakis said he told the president that papandreou could not 
continue handling matters of national interest since the socialists 
were defeated 
with 98 percent of the votes counted the leftistcommunist 
coalition has emerged as a kingmaker with 135 percent of the vote 
giving it 31 seats in the parliament 
new democracy won 4429 percent giving it 144 seats seven short 
of a majority and papandreous panehellenic socialist movement 
3918 percent giving it 125 seats 
the communists said they are ready to cooperate with papandreous 
party but only if papandreou and all other party members they 
maintain are involved in the scandals are excluded 
papandreou and senior members of his party have been accused by 
the opposition of being involved in a multimilliondollar scandal by 
fugitive banker george koskotas the owner of the bank of crete 
koskotas is in prison in the united states awaiting the hearing of 
an extradition demand by the greek government 
mitsotakis and the communist alliance maintain the election 
result was a clear mandate for an investigation of the scandals 
but papandreou said tuesday that the greek people gave the 
majority to the democraticprogressive forces and excluded the 
return of the right and conservatism to power 
these forces have the obligation to govern the state this is 
the clear and indisputable mandate of the greek people he added 
in what was interpreted as yet another indirect appeal to the 
communist alliance to join forces with his party

secretary of state james a baker iii on 
tuesday endorsed the potential revolution under way in the 
soviet union but criticized president mikhail s gorbachev for not 
taking a strong stand against suppression of reform in china 
baker in a prepared statement to the senate foreign relations 
committee reigstered us support for reform throughout the 
communist world whether in asia or in europe he said reform is 
very much in our interests 
at the same time baker said no one could predict the outcome of 
the changes taking place in moscow and elsewhere in the end he 
said we do know that the success of reform will depend primarily 
upon choices made in moscow beijing or east berlin not washington 
brussels or bonn 
he stressed however that political and economic reform were 
necessary in order for the east to progress 
to stand in the way of such necessary historic change as we 
are seeing to our outrage and sorrow in china is to turn ones 
back to the future and that is why general secretary gorbachevs 
temporizing comments on those tragic events are disappointing he 
said 
baker apparently referred to a statement by the soviet leader 
last week that he did not have sufficient information on events 
in china to make a balanced and responsible judgment about 
beijings actions 
baker appeared before the committee mostly to report on his 
meeting in moscow last month with soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze and on the summit president bush held in brussels at 
the end of the month with the leaders of the 15 other north atlantic 
treaty organization nations 
there bush outlined a proposal for reductions in nato and warsaw 
pact conventional troops and armories in europe and delayed 
consideration of deploying more powerful shortrange nuclear 
missiles in west germany 
baker told the committee the administration was exploring and 
establishing new vehicles to foster cooperation with the soviet 
union 
were actively engaging moscow with our eyes open and fixed on 
our longstanding goals and interests he said 
baker said these goals were to protect western security and to 
promote democratic values and interests 
the movement were seeing in soviet politics presents a 
potential revolution a revolution we hope will succeed baker 
said 
in reviewing us relations with the soviet union for the senate 
committee he endorsed reform in moscow eastern europe and china

the conciergerie the dank and forbidding stone 
prison where victims of the french revolution spent their final 
moments opened to the public tuesday in all its former gloom and 
grandeur 
queen marie antoinette occupied a cell on the ground floor for 10 
weeks in 1793 hoping her supporters would come up with enough money 
to buy her freedom 
she waited in vain and went to her death at the guillotine on 
oct 16 1793 
the cell she shared with her jailer later was turned into a 
chapel as a shrine to her memory but a replica of the cell has been 
recreated nearby and is decorated with wallpaper embossed with the 
royal blue and gold lily emblems that covered the walls 200 years 
ago 
maximilien robespierre who sent thousands of heads rolling 
during his 12month reign of terror against counterrevolutionaries 
spent his final hours a few cells away on july 28 1794 
his death warrant arrived about 10 am and he was carted away 
to the guillotine in midafternoon michel colardelle of the 
culture ministry said during a tour of the restored landmark 
overlooking the seine the spot is marked by a simple black marble 
plaque 
admirers of robespierre known as the incorruptible say history 
has not done him justice 
he has been made to bear all the guilt of the terror said 
former health minister leon schwartzenberg one of several public 
figures eager to rehabilitate robespierres memory 
all revolutions are characterized by excess of some sort 
otherwise they would not be revolutions he said 
no one however can accuse the french of not paying tribute to 
robespierres victims and others who died during the turbulent 
events 
a small room on the second floor is devoted entirely to their 
memory its four walls are covered with framed lists in 
alphabetical order of the 2780 aristocrats gardeners shoemakers 
doctors and clergymen found guilty by the revolutionary tribunal and 
beheaded within three days the verdict was either guilty or 
acquittal there were no appeals 
some names are familiar like charlotte corday who stabbed 
jeanpaul marat in his bath others like f perrin gardener are 
not 
a short film with english subtitles helps visitors follow the 
events and depicts daily life at the prison 
ordinary prisoners shared the squalor of cold cells littered with 
filthy straw the wealthy bought their way into cells furnished with 
beds and sometimes even desks where many an aristocrat penned his 
memoirs 
also recreated are the quarters where the condemned were taken to 
have their shirts ripped wide and the napes of their necks shaved so 
the guillotines blade would cut cleanly 
prisoners were allowed to circulate freely during the day in the 
womens courtyard despite their predicament many privileged ladies 
managed to keep up with fashion trends and even groomed themselves 
without the help of maids 
marie antoinette in her final days even learned to put up her 
own hair said jean chalon author of a recent biography 
the 375000 renovation of the conciergerie is one of several 
refurbishing projects linked to bicentennial celebrations

david rivkin has produced hit albums for prince 
fine young cannibals and jody watley but the minneapolis native has 
higher priorities 
in the back of my mind i always go for the single said the 
producer of princes kiss watleys looking for a new love 
and fine young cannibals she drives me crazy all no 1 smashes 
i go for the throat really i really am a singlesoriented 
person its really the way i want to go after it 
like a baseball manager who must cope with the personalities of 
different players rivkin known in the business as david z 
adjusts his style to fit the artist with prince a gifted 
songwriter and arranger the producer sees himself as a collaborator 
and occasional mind reader 
hes a different personality every day so you just have to 
capture whatever personality he is that day i just think about how 
to frame whatever mindset hes in 
with tyka nelson princes introverted sister rivkin took a more 
delicate approach 
he remembered the jets first album as his most difficult 
it was the first real time we discovered a new artrist and we 
had to come through with all the songs and vocals we were shooting 
in the dark we were taking kids from a bar band and trying to make 
a national product rivkin said 
we had to establish a direction that was a bit difficult we 
had to do every vocal there was no sampling somes things you take 
for granted now 
rivkin was once a musician himself playing guitar for billy 
preston and writing with countryrock artist gram parsons he had 
lived in los angeles in the early 1970s but returned to his 
hometown in 1974 
he was soon behind the control board 
i didnt want to do it at the time but i realized i had much 
more control over material sitting behind that seat i gave up the 
idea of being a rock star 
in 1980 he engineered lipps incs no 1 dance hit 
funkytown and played guitar on their album he has since 
produced a remarkable range of acts from the minnesota funk of 
prince and jesse johnson to the blueeyed soul of hall amp oates and 
boy george to the dance music of watley and jermaine jackson 
i try to fill the holes the artists cant fill he said 
that comes from doing the right sound a special snare drum sound 
a special vocal echo and from making the artists feel good enough 
to bring out their personality 
his sheer diversity has had drawbacks in an industry that loves 
labels and openly categorizes music according to race its hard to 
define a white kid from the midwest who produces bestselling dance 
records by black artists 
i used to be classified as an rampb producer it was a hard notch 
to get out of because i was white i would get a lot of flack ive 
had a lot of no 1 black records in the face of all that my own 
inclination was to combine rock and rampb 
rivkin compared himself to in a way to alfred hitchcock speaking 
of the cameo appearances that were the great film directors 
trademark a guitar riff is rivkins subtle way of popping up in his 
work 
i think if you look real hard theres a thread running through 
all those records he said rhythmically theres a certain 
sound in kiss its a major part of the record sometimes it 
appears as a little wink 
his presence is unmistakeable in the studio hit singles dont 
come easy and rivkin pushes hard for the best sound 
i make singers breath and emote a lot more than they would 
normally i always look for that sexy breath theres a fine line 
between getting it perfect and not losing the artist when youre 
doing it i dont care if theres some rough edges he said 
finding a producer is like finding a wife its tough its a 
chemistry thing i like to get involved from the ground up usually 
what i do is start programming drum parts at home on my machine if 
you get a good drum and bass part thats 90 percent of the pop 
record

republican national chairman lee 
atwaters highly partisan remarks to the nations mayors have 
touched off criticism and dismay from elected city leaders of both 
parties 
i was embarrassed and disappointed said republican mayor 
bill hudnut of indianapolis following atwaters remarks to the us 
conference of mayors on monday 
it was insulting to me and i think it was the most insensitive 
speech ive ever heard said democratic mayor wilson goode of 
philadelphia 
atwater used his appearance to declare the national republican 
party would work actively for republican mayoral candidates in new 
york and elsewhere and would seek to recruit a half dozen to a 
dozen black mayoral candidates around this country to support 
actively 
he drew a ripple of reaction from the more than 200 mayors when 
he said mayors would be an effective farm team for the 
republicans who could later run for governor house and senate seats 
and attempting to show his commitment to recruiting blacks 
atwater singled out for introduction a black republican mayor james 
a garner of hempstead ny but mistakenly called him the mayor of 
schenectady ny 
garner later called the slip insignificant and said chairman 
atwater knows my name and who i am 
today new york mayor ed koch a democrat told reporters that 
gop mayors had told him they were embarrassed by atwaters remarks 
targeting koch for defeat 
koch called atwater amoral and pathological for an 
innuendofilled memo blasting house speaker tom foley atwater 
denied having seen the memo before it was released although an aide 
resigned over the controversy 
democratic national chairman ron brown appearing before the 
mayors today attacked the gop chairman for pushing politics to 
its worst extremes 
thanks to the lee atwaters of the world national politics is 
looking more and more like the coastline of valdez alaska he 
said 
it was too patronizing hudnut said monday about atwaters 
remarks 
i didnt think it was appropriate to refer to us as a farm team 
for the major leagues he added i think a lot of mayors deal 
with tougher issues than congress does 
atwater has been under fire for an innuendofilled memo attacking 
house speaker tom foley nd brown has called on atwater to resign 
the president of the conference democratic mayor arthur holland 
of trenton nj referred to atwater with a quip at a later session 
i think lee atwater assumed that we had arranged a recruitment 
opportunity for him he said 
even housing and urban development secretary jack kemp made 
reference to atwaters appearance and triggered applause when he 
told the mayors he was there representing president bush not the 
republican national committee 
goode said he disliked the partisanship and atwaters singling 
out of the new york race where republicans hope to unseat democrat 
edward i koch 
we need to hear what the republican party intends to do about 
the issues facing the cities goode said we dont want to know 
that he wants to defeat koch 
koch had not yet arrived for the conference when atwater spoke 
in his remarks atwater said he was very excited about 
prospects in new york and planned to put a substantial effort 
into that race 
if we can establish a political beachhead in a city like new 
york thats going to be a political shot heard across this 
country he said 
new orleans mayor sidney barthelemy a democrat pointed to 
atwaters remarks that the republican party was interested in cities 
but would only put money in projects that work barthelemy noted 
that the convention center where the meeting was held was financed 
in part with federal urban development action grants a program the 
reagan administration succeeded in killing 
the very programs that help cities they eliminated 
barthelemy said

charged south korea delayed talks further by arresting a south 
korean dissident clergyman the rev moon ikhwan when he returned 
in april from a visit to pyongyang moon was charged with acting as 
a north korean agent 
we consider that your side should set free rev moon ikhwan 
who was arrested unreasonably and show sincerity to take a step 
to create an atmosphere of dialogue the letter said 
neither nation allows its citizens to visit the other side 
without permission seoul said moons visit was part of efforts to 
cause political chaos

winemakers ernest and julio gallo today won 
exclusive rights to the family name thwarting a younger brother who 
had put his name on a brand of cheese 
us district judge robert e coyle ruled that joseph gallos use 
of his full name on cheese was calculated to mislead consumers into 
thinking the brand is connected with the e amp j gallo winery 
the judge ordered joseph gallo to quit using his name on cheese 
joseph gallo has no direct connection with the modesto 
califbased gallo winery the worlds largest but sells grapes to 
his older brothers 
joseph gallos attorney denis rice said he will recommend an 
appeal rice said at trial in december that he knew of no case in 
which a person was prohibited from using his full name on a 
noncompeting product 
ernest and julio gallo claimed in a 1986 lawsuit that they had 
contracted with a company to market cheese under the gallo name 
patrick lynch attorney for the winery contended that joseph 
gallo was riding on the recognition and riding on the power that 
the gallo mark conferred 
previously a federal judge threw out a countersuit in which 
joseph gallo 69 claimed he is entitled to onethird of the winery 
holdings on grounds that it developed from the estate of the gallo 
brothers parents 
ernest now 80 and julio now 78 began making wine in 1933 
shortly after their father killed their mother then committed 
suicide their attorney said

procter amp gamble co said tuesday that it will 
fund several projects to recycle some of the 16 billion disposable 
diapers used and discarded in the united states each year 
plans call for the plastic in the diapers to be recycled into 
such things as flower pots garabage bags and park benches while 
the pulp will be used in cardboard boxes building insulation and 
wallboard liner 
environmentalists warn that the plasticcoated disposable 
diapers used by 85 percent of babies in the united states dont 
decompose that they say could provide potential breeding grounds 
for dangerous viruses and bacteria that cause polio hepatitis 
meningitis and other diseases 
we believe as a company it is our responsibility to ensure that 
our products are good not only for the baby but that they are good 
for the environment and can be easily recycled composed and 
incinerated said nancy eddy pampgs project coordinator 
pampg the largest disposable diaper maker sells 165 billion 
worth of pampers and luvs annually 
company officials speaking at a news conference at the national 
press club said pampg would spend an undetermined amount of money 
over the next five years on recycling projects in the states of 
washington minnesota wisconsin and florida 
the project includes an effort with the solid waste utility and 
rabanco co of seattle wash which will collect used diapers from 
1000 volunteer households the diapers will be washed and sanitized 
before being separated into plastic and pulp 
pampg also will provide money and soiled diapers to recomp inc a 
st cloud minn recycling company that turns much of that citys 
garbage into a composted soil used in landscaping and to reclaim 
salttainted highway strips 
st cloud already recycles diapers but pampg will import 
additional dirty diapers from st paul 
diapers which make up an estimated 1 percent to 2 percent of the 
nations garbage heap are not the largest landfill problem but 
items such as paper bottles and cans unlike diapers can be 
recycled 
nebraska lawmakers have banned the sale of nonbiodegradable 
diapers by 1993 the legislation notes both the environmental threat 
and the fact that biodegradable diapers use a plastic made from 
corn a crop grown in nebraska 
legislators in iowa washington and oregon have considered 
similar action 
richard nicolosi vice president of pampgs paper products 
division said the announcement was not motivated by market or 
legislative pressures 
i dont think that any one announcement is going to stop the 
concern within state legislatures he said what i hope it will 
do is focus attention on viable solutions 
carl lehrburger an albany ny recycling expert who has 
studied disposable diapers for the clothdiaper industry asked if 
the recycling of plastic and paper would be economically feasible 
i applaud their efforts in seeking alternatives to the 
environmentally harmful disposal of their product he said but 
added that the company seemed determined to maintain its product 
rather than changing to a more ecologically sound diaper 
pampg will spend 160000 in an effort to prove that competitors 
diapers touted as biodegradable dont decompose any faster than 
pampg brands 
robert ham an environmental engineer at the university of 
wisconsin will bury regular and biodegradable disposable diapers in 
landfill sites in madison wis west palm beach fla and a site 
in maine still to be chosen 
the time capsules will be exhumed over the next five years to 
see if biodegradable diapers decompose any faster than the regular 
disposable diapers made by pampg 
we dont believe that biodegradability is a solidwaste 
solution said bob greene associate director of pampg research and 
development

a democratic member of the senate armed 
services committee on tuesday urged defense secretary dick cheney to 
suspend production of the b2 stealth bomber because the aircraft 
has yet to undergo flight testing 
cheney in response reaffirmed his support for the b2 which at 
500 million a copy is the most expensive plane in history the 
bomber is a necessary component of the triad of air land and 
seabased nuclear weapons said pete williams cheneys spokesman 
sen john glenn dohio a former astronaut and test pilot 
argued that pursuing production of the radarevading plane violates 
the rule of fly before buy 
the bomber program has been buy it and then well see how it 
flies glenn said in a letter to cheney 
the b2 is a total departure from our usual new aircraft 
glenn said said it is a flying wing there are new control 
concepts different center of gravity considerations and new 
aerodynamics just to name a few going ahead with additional 
production before flight tests have even started just doesnt make 
sense 
cheney has proposed pushing back production of the stealth bomber 
a year to 1993 and cutting almost 41 billion from fiscal 1990 and 
1991 budgets for the plane 
glenn said 224 billion has already been invested in the stealth 
program and concluded that it would be totally irresponsible to 
continue production without flight test results 
glenn argued that the money earmarked for the stealth bomber 
could be used for highpriority conventional programs that have 
been terminated or deferred 
glenn a former marine said he favors the marine corps v22 
osprey a battlefield aircraft designed to take off like a 
helicopter and fly like an airplane the pentagon had hoped to spend 
259 billion on 663 ospreys including 13 billion in 1990 but 
cheney decided to terminate the program 
cheney is a big believer in the triad and he thinks the b2s 
longrange capabilities and its stealth capacities make it an 
important strategic asset to the united states said williams 
so he plans to continue right on with that and he reaffirmed his 
strong support for the b2 program

dieters who lose 10 or 20 pounds may give away 
their baggy old clothes but dennis genzs 173pound loss left him 
with too much skin so he donated about 4 square feet to help save 
burn victims 
this is a first for us occasionally rarely if a child is 
a patient a parent may donate skin betty perls director of 
education for the regional organ bank of illinois said tuesday 
the 5foot11 genz 43 weighed 430 pounds last august when he 
began a highprotein weightloss regimen 
last week he weighed in at 260 and prepared for surgery to 
remove excess skin from his abdomen to ease back pains and other 
problems 
i was sitting at lunch with some nurses and we were joking that 
it was too bad i couldnt donate the skin said genz equipment 
coordinator for the emergency department at sherman hospital in 
elgin just northwest of chicago 
then one of the nurses said why not he recalled tuesday 
from his hospital bed where he was recovering from mondays surgery 
the decision left me with a good feeling genz said adding 
that he felt fine but had kind of a big scar 
ive worked in emergency rooms for 25 years im a strong 
supporter of transplants he said 
what if he gains back the lost weight 
the skin would just stretch out again but i dont intend to 
gain the weight back genz said 
the operation removed 19 pounds of skin and adjoining tissue 
genz said 
his donated skin about four square feet will be used to care 
for burn patients at the university of chicago medical center 
more lives are saved by skin transplants than any other donated 
organ said dr lawrence gottlieb professor of surgery and 
director of the universitys burn unit 
what kills burn patients is loss of fluid and infection ms 
perls said 
donated skin is used as a kind of living bandage while the 
patient regenerates his own skin she said then the borrowed tissue 
sloughs off 
because its use is temporary skin used for burn patients need 
not be a perfect tissue type match like that used for skin grafts or 
other organ transplants ms perls said 
she noted that noting most such tissue is removed from cadavers 
but while getzs contribution is unusual this kind of weight 
loss is unusual too she said 
anything that will make people think about organ or tissue 
donation is good she said 
university hospital spokesman john easton agreed 
theres a shortage of any sort of donated organ it is 
beneficial and it comes at a good time i think theyre planning to 
use some of it today easton said of genzs contribution 
i think any sort of organ donation is a valuable 
lifesaving procedure

robert argyropoulos talked to a machine tuesday 
and the machine talked back telling the 22yearold engineering 
student the time reading newspaper articles aloud and dialing a 
phone number 
its developers say the machine though still primitive is the 
most promising aid for the blind since the introduction of braille 
160 years ago 
the personal companion unveiled at a news conference was 
created for the 65 million americans who cannot see well enough to 
read or are so handicapped they cant turn a page or punch a 
keyboard 
the machine has the appearance of a computer but without a 
keyboard it is programmed to respond to the voice of its user 
transceptor technologies inc an ann arbor mich company 
founded in 1986 by people with backgrounds in medicine visual 
rehabilitation telecommunications computer design and education 
developed the personal companion 
argyropoulos a 22yearold computer buff designed the softwear 
working 20 hours to 80 hours a week while a student at the 
university of michigan 
he said he wanted to build a machine not for the superstar 
blind person but one that your grandmother could use without knowing 
anything about computers 
argyropoulos said 20 minutes of training by the machine which 
gives instructions by voice are all thats needed to get started 
company president bernard f mccrory said the machine costs 
6500 to 6800 the higher priced model comes with a screen for 
the visually impaired on which the type can be made several inches 
high 
mccrory said the machine could be leased by those who cant 
afford to buy one 
carroll jackson director of the greater detroit society for the 
blind and a consultant to the company called the development 
analogous to the introduction of braille by blind frenchman 
louis braille in 1829 
jackson who is legally blind compared its potential impact to 
the introduction of curb cuts that enable people in wheelchairs to 
use sidewalks 
in the voice demonstration argyropoulos had the machine do 
mathematical computations record a checkbook transaction but not 
actually write the check tell what was in his appointment ledger 
and turn on the radio and the lights 
at his command the device called information to get and record a 
phone number and then dialed the number 
by arrangement with the gannett co a condensed version of usa 
today is made available each day over a telephone line the 
machines synthetic mechanical sounding voice lists the sections of 
the newspaper recites the headlines and reads abbreviated versions 
of stories selected by the user 
ultimately mccrory said far more information will be available 
from computer data banks and the machine will play compact discs 
each capable of reading aloud up to 50 books 
company founder mark blumenkranz an ophthalmologist and surgeon 
at the kresge eye institute in detroit said an engineer who lost 
his sight in a hunting accident five years ago consequently lost his 
business 
the engineer has been testing the machine and feels he will be 
able to go back into business for himself blumenkranz said

new controls on chinese travel abroad took effect 
tuesday causing the number of applicants for us visas to plummet 
dozens of chinese had camped outside the us and canadian 
embassies in hopes of getting their visa applications in before the 
new rules took effect 
among them were doctors computer scientists and economists some 
of chinas besteducated and brightest citizens all hoping to study 
or do research abroad 
we didnt dare leave to eat or sleep for fear of losing our 
place in line said an economist who succeeded in applying at the 
canadian embassy and was waiting outside for a response 
the revised visa requirements appeared designed to screen 
depatures more carefully and prevent fugitive dissidents from 
getting out they came two weeks after the army rolled into beijing 
and opened fired on students and supporters demanding a freer 
society 
there was much confusion about the new regulations 
under existing procedure chinese are required to obtain exit 
permits from their local police stations before chinese guards 
outside foreign embassies allow them to enter to apply for visas 
according to reports in the official media over the weekend the 
new rules invalidate all permits issued before tuesday through 
monday chinese could still use the old permits to enter embassy 
grounds but as of tuesday the old permits were not good for even 
that 
one radio report and a chinese source said visa applicants now 
must also get a second permit after obtaining the visa many chinese 
applicants and several western consular officials said they did not 
know about this requirement and it could not immediately be 
confirmed 
us embassy spokesman sheridan bell said only three chinese 
showed up at the consulate tuesday with the new permit and were 
allowed by chinese guards to apply for visas by comparison 350 
people applied on monday about average for summertime he said 
the united states and canada are two of the most popular 
destinations for chinese traveling abroad for business or study a 
third popular country australia has not reopened its consular 
section since closing it after the military crackdown began on june 
3 
most of those waiting outside the us and canadian embassies on 
tuesday made plans to go abroad before the crackdown and were not 
involved in the protests 
but they said they feared police would be stingy about issuing 
exit permits in the new conservative political climate 
i havent been in trouble but chinese officials may be 
worried about spiritual pollution said a doctor waiting for a 
response to his wifes application to study in canada 
chinese officials refer to unwanted western cultural influences 
and values as spiritual pollution

president bush is seeking to take advantage of 
new openness in the kremlin as he forges a soviet policy designed to 
meld moscow into the international community 
bush is on the move now unveiling new arms negotiating tactics 
as well as plans to relax financial strictures on poland as that 
sovietbloc nation moves toward democracy 
but four months of silence at the beginning of the 
administration while the president and his aides conducted a 
strategic review left the impression that the new team was 
uncertain how to deal with a volcano of soviet reform 
robert blackwill national security council staff member for 
soviet and european affairs and other bush aides are seeking to 
counter that impression 
we know where we want to go blackwill said we know of the 
enormous opportunities that are out there and we also understand 
that if one makes a mistake in an era of transition that there is 
no inevitability for stability in international order and it could 
have a very high price 
we are trying to create the structure of a relationship that 
makes it less likely it can be reversed less likely that we can 
have a return to the sort of conflict we saw in the 1970s and 80s 
and finally to integrate the soviet union into the international 
system so that it uses its enormous power to solve international 
problems rather than to exploit them blackwill said in a speech 
tuesday at the us chamber of commerce in washington 
bush during a summit of the north atlantic treaty organization 
three weeks ago outlined a plan to rapidly reduce superpower 
conventional forces in europe surpassing even the proposals of 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
some of the fine print of bushs sovietbloc plans outlined in 
broad terms over the past two months has been disclosed recently 
concerning arms negotiating tactics and help for the polish economy 
within a few days said blackwill the administration will 
divulge specifics of new proposals in the strategic arms reduction 
talks to test with the soviets means of verifying the reduction 
or elimination of longrange nuclear weapons 
the ideas take advantage of apparent new soviet openness to 
verification and are designed to avoid the senate misgivings that 
helped block ratification of the strategic arms limitation treaty in 
1979 and held up the intermediaterange nuclear force treaty last 
year said blackwill 
the purpose of the confidencebuilding and verification 
measures which are being conveyed to the soviets are to 
accelerate not delay a historic agreement said blackwill 
declining to specify whether the proposals envision onsite 
inspections or satellite surveillance 
more details of bushs policy toward eastern europe are expected 
early next month when bush travels to poland and hungary two soviet 
bloc nations that blackwill said are pushing away the dead hand of 
communism with their political and economic reforms 
some believe that in trying to conceptualize a sovietamerican 
relationship through the end of the century taking four months to 
do that is a long time i dont how long they take to buy a 
house blackwill said 
we have to keep remembering that dealing with an autocratic 
system as exists in the soviet union that reversibility is 
possible we have just seen tragic evidence of that fact in china 
said blackwill referring to the suppression of the prodemocracy 
movement in beijing in which thousands reportedly died 
bush and his top aides have lived most of their adult lives 
during the cold war blackwill and his boss national security 
adviser brent scowcroft also served in the white house during 
detente under presidents nixon and ford when many proclaimed the 
end to the cold war 
and so they dilute their hope with caution 
i wrote myself the toast that president nixon gave in moscow 
indicating that detente was irreversible in the early 1970s said 
blackwill it turned out that that wasnt so 
the danger still exists the cold war began in eastern 
europe and it must end there he said adding that soviet military 
intervention in poland or hungary now would set back normalization 
of eastwest relations through the end of the century 
it is somewhat difficult for me to imagine that the cold war is 
over when today there are 580000 members of the red army in 
eastern europe he said after mr gorbachevs unilateral 
reductions which we welcome which were announced at the united 
nations last december there will still be 550000 men of the red 
army in eastern europe we have a ways to go before the cold war is 
over in eastern europe

frank gasparros artwork is worth a fortune 
but people drop it on the ground every day one cent at a time and 
few bother to pick it up 
for sentimental reasons gasparro usually fetches pennies from 
the sidewalk 
gasparro designed the tails side of the penny that replaced the 
wheatback penny 30 years ago his initials can be found just to the 
right of the lincoln memorials base 
occassionally when he gets a penny in change hell point out his 
work to the cashier 
they think im goofy the former chief engraver of the united 
states said ill say i designed it you can see my initials if 
youve got good eyesight 
as the man who designed the susan b anthony dollar he is the 
only living person to have sculpted the front and back of a 
generalcirculation us coin he also designed the back of the john 
f kennedy half dollar 
gasparro who asked a reporter not to write his age said he is 
dissappointed the susan b anthony dollar wasnt more popular he 
figures people just couldnt get used to a dollar that doesnt fold 
but the back of the penny which he designed in 1958 and was 
first issued in 1959 to mark the 150th anniversary of lincolns 
birth is the most circulated of his work 
when he presented his design to his superiors they told him to 
remove the words lincoln memorial from below the relief of the 
building and 13 stars that ran around the outer edge of the coin 
gasparro agreed but refused to take out his initials and the 
tiny statue of lincoln between the sixth and seventh columns two 
features his boss said would look like smudges of dirt 
if you do that it would look like a library he recalled 
saying at the time 
after 38 years at the mint gasparro retired in 1981 and has been 
sculpting about 15 to 20 commemorative coins a year for private 
groups

prime minister yitzhak shamir in a rare moment 
of candor about his personal life said tuesday he was so determined 
to come to jerusalem from poland in 1935 that he lied to get around 
british restrictions 
shamir applied and was accepted at the hebrew university of 
jerusalem that year even though he had no plans to study the 
acceptance paved the way for an entry permit from the british 
i decided that this was the only way he said 
the polishborn shamir who was leader of a militant jewish 
underground and later a senior officer in israels mossad 
intelligence service usually is tightlipped about his personal 
life 
he was speaking to about 600 israelis who were among 2000 jews 
saved from the nazi holocaust with the help of acceptance 
certificates from the university between 1932 and 1941 
many applicants used the certificates to get around immigration 
restrictions said university spokesman jerry barrach the 
university was trying to save as many people as possible but had to 
limit the number of certificates because it was being closely 
watched by the british barrach said 
in his 1935 application the 20yearold shamir wrote he had 
studied law for a year at warsaw university to please his parents 
but that hebrew literature was his true love 
after some months of study it became clear to me that the only 
place where i could fully realize my desires and exercise my 
abilities would be the institute for jewish studies at the hebrew 
university wrote shamir then known as icko yezernicki 
he also wrote that his family was welloff and would support him 
the letter wasnt too accurate a description of my feelings 
shamir conceded tuesday i had to put my family into debt to be 
able to immigrate 
he said he spent some of his first days in jerusalem wandering 
around campus and sitting in the library 
i wanted to study also hebrew literature but i couldnt 
because i had nothing to live on shamir told reporters adding 
with a smile in the meantime i got involved in other things 
they included joining irgun zvi leumi a militant jewish 
underground group that fought british mandatory rule in palestine 
in 1940 he became a founder and leader of the stern gang which 
carried out a campaign of political assassinations and bombings of 
british installations in 1948 the united nations ended the british 
mandate and established the state of israel 
asked whether he was sorry he didnt complete his studies shamir 
said not at all i dont regret anything i did

japan will test for radiation contamination from a 
onemegaton nuclear bomb that fell into its waters from a us 
aircraft carrier 24 years ago officials said tuesday 
even if radioactivity is found however it will be very hard 
to distinguish whether it came from the lost bomb or from nuclear 
tests said michiaki okubo of the science and technology agencys 
nuclear safety bureau 
japan did not learn until last month that an a4 skyhawk plane 
carrying a hydrogen bomb rolled off the carrier ticonderoga on dec 
5 1965 about 80 miles from a small island near okinawa south of 
japan 
the bomb and plane settled in the sea bed after its radioactive 
material dissolved into the sea water according to an official us 
report released by the japanese government last month 
researchers will take water samples from eight locations and 
results may be announced by september okubo said 
we will check water samples to learn about the environmental 
effects on fish he said 
okubo said no samples of earth will be taken from the sea bed 
where the bomb sank because scientists have no samples for 
comparison 
fish samples from the site already have been sent for analysis at 
a government research institute by a local government in 
southwestern japan news reports said results should be known by 
midjuly 
last month nuclear specialist william arkin of the 
washingtonbased institute for policy studies which released a 
declassified us navy document on the accident said there is 
little danger the bomb could detonate 
but the 33 pounds of radioactive plutonium in the bomb could 
threaten the environment as it deteriorates he said 
opposition parties and some citizens groups charge us navy 
ships routinely visit japanese ports carrying nuclear bombs in 
violation of japans nonnuclear policies

that

for prostitution police reports said

third man as well but not as seriously mccarthy said 
williams who served time for rape in the past and is in jail 
facing two additional charges has denied any involvement in the 
killings 
but mccarthy noting he could only speak for the 11 dade county 
cases said williams is a main suspect in some of them 
eleven of the killings occurred in metrodades juristiction 
seven in miami and one in hialeah 
williams has been linked with four of the dead women mccarthy 
said he knew them or he dated them or he did drugs with them 
he said 
in addition relatives and friends of one of the miami victims 
have said she knew williams 
since williams was arrested in early april on the rape charges 
no women have been found dead in the same manner 
miami police spokesman ray lang said his departments detectives 
have little to say about the case 
our investigators are cooperating with the county in

a tearful state treasurer a james 
manchin on tuesday announced his retirement effective the day 
before the state senate was to consider removing him from office 
manchins decision saves his 2000amonth pension which he 
could have lost had he been ousted from office for his role in the 
loss of 279 million from an investment fund his office supervised 
i cannot in good conscience ask the people of this state to 
endure the financial and emotional expenses that would accompany a 
lengthy political trial and thats what it would be a political 
trial manchin 62 said during a west virginia day celebration 
marking the states 126th birthday 
state del rod berry one of the five house of delegates members 
who would have helped present the case against manchin said he had 
mixed feelings 
i think it may have done the state some good to kind of have a 
trial in the case because it would have shown the citizens just 
exactly what went on in the treasurers office and hopefully prevent 
it from ever happening again berry said 
on the other hand im certainly glad we dont have to expend 
the states money to put on this trial 
he said the trial would have lasted a month and cost 750000 
another member of the house team del jim rowe said a trial 
would have given the state bad publicity 
im certainly relieved for his benefit as well as the 
states rowe said i think as things stood this morning it was 
the honorable thing to do he should have done it a while back 
manchin said he will concentrate on supporting the special 
olympics the spinal cord injury foundation and ronald mcdonald 
houses 
the time for my departure is at hand manchin said reading 
from his letter to gov gaston caperton announcing his retirement 
effective july 9 i have fought a good fight i have finished my 
course i have kept the faith 
caperton will appoint a temporary successor to manchin and 
voters in the 1990 general election will select someone to fill the 
remaining two years of manchins term secretary of state ken 
hechler said 
manchin served in the house of delegates as secretary of state

the us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
said in a 21 decision that the first amendments free exercise of 
religious guarantee does not require the requested exemption 
the court found that carl eric olsen a selfdescribed priest in 
the church who was once convicted of importing 20 tons of marijuana 
was not denied equal protectionestablishment clause rights by the 
governments refusal to accommodate his churchs sacramental use of 
marijuna 
the panel upheld a decision of the drug enforcement 
administration to deny the exemption 
it noted that olsen had once been convicted of importing 20 tons 
of marijuana which dea had called an outragous quantity to supply 
his churchs religious needs 
according to the court the religion has up to 2000 adherents in 
jamaica and no more than 200 in the united states 
the court in an opinion by circuit judge ruth b ginsburg said 
that granting olsen the exemption would require the government to 
make supplies of marijuana available to olsens church on a regular 
basis 
we are unaware of any free exercise precedent for compelling 
government accommodation of religious practices when that 
accommodation requires burdensome and constant official supervision 
and management ginsburg wrote in the opinion joined by circuit 
judge laurence silberman 
circuit judge james buckley filed a dissent saying dea had not 
adequately explained why it denied olsens claim but granted a 
religious exemption for the use of peyote to the native american 
church an american indian religion 
this denominational preference constitutes a violation of the 
establishment clause of the constitution that bars the government 
from setting up an official religion buckley said 
the dea has chosen to accommodate one religion but not 
another he wrote the establishment clause compels the agency 
to justify its distinction and requires us to scrutinize the 
agencys rational strictly 
olsen reached by telephone at a marshall ark farm said he 
would seek a rehearing of the case by the full appellate court 
olsen who says he served a fiveyear prison term for state and 
federal marijuana convictions said he continues to use marijuana 
daily but no longer sells it 
olsen said marijuana selling had hurt the reputation of the 
ethiopian zion coptic church from which he has dissociated himself 
we want to make it clear we are not associated with selling 
marijuana he said 
the marijuana selling was just something a temptation that 
came in and overwhelmed people he said 
olsen denied that his disaffiliation from the church undermines 
his religious claim were still here for the same thing we came 
here for before the fellowship

a federal judge today postponed oliver l 
norths sentencing until july 5 to consider allegations of 
misconduct against a juror at the former white house aides 
irancontra trial 
us district judge gerhard a gesell ordered an evidentiary 
hearing to be held june 28 and directed court clerks to place 
details of the defense allegation on the public record 
the court papers were to be released later in the day but it is 
understood the defense had raised allegations of misconduct against 
juror tara king who told reporters after the trial that she had 
once used cocaine 
ms king said she did not use cocaine during the eightweek trial 
gesell granted a motion by norths lawyers to reconsider his 
earlier refusal to hold a closed hearing on the defense allegations 
gesell rescheduled the sentencing from friday until july 5 
prosecutors have said north should go to prison because he broke 
the law during the irancontra scandal lied about it during his 
trial and still doesnt show one iota of remorse 
in a sentencing memo likening the fired white house aide to the 
corrupt politicians of tammany hall prosecutors say north viewed 
and continues to view himself as being above the law and beyond 
reproach 
the former national security council aide faces a possible 
10year term for destroying evidence aiding and abetting the 
obstruction of congress and accepting an illegal gratuity 
letting north go without a prison term would be a statement 
that 15 years after watergate government officials can participate 
in a brazen coverup lie to congress and collect a substantial 
gratuity and still receive only a slap on the wrist prosecutors 
told gesell in their memo monday 
norths view that anything goes in a political controversy 
would be sustained by letting him off without a prison sentence 
said the memo signed by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
instead since his acts are a serious breach of the public trust 
they warrant serious punishment 
walsh did not make a specific recommendation of how much time 
north should serve in prison norths lawyers are likely to file a 
response to the prosecutors harsh statement 
walsh charged that north concocted a false story to help win 
acquittal on a charge that he pocketed 4300 in travelers checks 
entrusted to him by adolfo calero a nicaraguan contra leader 
norths testimony that he purchased a car with 15000 in cash he 
accumulated in a box nailed to his closet floor echoed the flimsy 
lies offered by corrupt municipal officials in the days of tammany 
hall walsh said in a reference to the new york political machine 
which ran the city from the mid19th century into the 1930s and 
became synonymous with graft and fraud 
walsh called the steel box story preposterous and said 
norths perjury represents another indication of his continuing 
callous attitude toward the judicial process and our democratic 
institutions 
throughout the 12page memo walsh repeated the theme that 
north has not indicated one iota of remorse for having committed 
crimes which because of his position of public trust jeopardized 
the constitutional processes of government 
he apparently sees nothing wrong with alteration and 
destruction of official national security records walsh said 
his participation in the preparation of a false and misleading 
chronology of usiran arms sales has not led to any 
acknowledgement of wrongdoing the prosecutor added 
certainly he sees nothing wrong with lying to congress when in 
the view of himself and his superiors lying is necessary walsh 
said north seems to believe that such activities are business as 
usual in government or necessary tactics in a political 
firestorm 
norths contempt for congress and the public is accompanied by 
venality in financial matters walsh said of the retired marine 
lieutenant colonels acceptance of a 13800 security system from 
arms dealer richard v secord an irancontra codefendant awaiting 
trial 
walsh said a prison term is necessary to reduce norths political 
following that was cultivated on the lecture circuit and 
reinforces his lack of remorse 
walsh rejected norths contention that he is a scapegoat 
few criminal defendants have attempted to blame so many others 
for so many lawless acts the independent prosecutor said north 
must accept his fair share of responsibility 
walsh also disputed norths suggestion at the trial that whatever 
he did had the implicit authorization of higher reagan 
administration officials 
this society cannot tolerate government officials unwilling and 
unable to exercise independent judgment and responsibility in 
refusing to perform illegal acts walsh said the sentence should 
show that one cannot simply rely on real or imagined authorization 
of illegal conduct and expect to escape responsibility walsh said

the son of prime minister olof palme 
testw the slaying suspect defendant carl gustaf christer 
pettersson in a police lineup i was shocked because the man i 
saw was so similar to the picture i had in my mind 
palme the dominant figure in swedish politics for more than a 
decade was killed feb 28 1986 as he and his wife lisbeth 
walked home from a late movie 
pettersson has denied shooting the prime minister 
the prosecution has accused pettersson 42 of waiting for palme 
to emerge from the theater following the couple for several hundred 
yards then shooting the swedish leader 
marten palme a 28yearold sociologist said he noticed a man 
who looked like pettersson as he and his girlfriend left his parents 
after discussing the film they had just seen together 
i saw him looking at my parents intently its possible that he 
followed them but im not sure he told the court 
but under questioning from defense attorney arne liljeros the 
younger palme said he had compared memories of the mans appearance 
with his mothers recollections several times since the shooting 
also tuesday witness larserik eriksson told the court that he 
had seen a man who looked like pettersson as eriksson waited in a 
car for his parents to come out of the theater 
i got a little frightened said eriksson 29 i even locked 
the car doors and i thought its better not to look too much at 
him this person can explode soon 
asked if he was certain pettersson was the man he saw eriksson 
replied can you ever be 100 percent sure but i am very sure 
birgitta wennerling a 47yearold painter said she noticed a 
suspicious man as she left an earlier showing of the film 
he was straining to see over peoples heads into the lobby she 
said and had a sick horrid look she and eriksson independently 
picked out pettersson in police lineups 
the trial adjourned until wednesday 
in a dramatic courtroom confrontation on monday mrs palme 
pointed to pettersson and said she was absolutely certain he was 
the man she saw nearby as her husband collapsed with a fatal bullet 
wound 
mrs palmes testimony was crucial for the prosecution which has 
suffered setbacks in trying to establish a motive and breaking the 
defendants alibi 
prosecutors have no murder weapon and no witness who saw 
pettersson with a gun in his hand 
mrs palme said she looked at pettersson three times after the 
shooting at first for help the prosecution has claimed no one else 
was on the scene who could have shot palme

the nuclear industrys proposed newgeneration 
reactors designed to operate more reliably and safely will not be 
available soon enough to help the global warming problem an 
antinuclear group said in a report tuesday 
the safe energy communication council said the nuclear industry 
was misleading the public by billing the advanceddesign reactors as 
a partial solution to global atmospheric warming caused by emissions 
from fossil fuel plants 
nuclear power offers a fools gold solution to global 
warming said scott denman the groups director 
alex antypas a researcher at the council said its too early to 
tell whether new reactor designs will prove better and more economic 
than the current generation 
it will take at least 10 years to develop and build a single 
demonstration plant and another two or more decades to bring many 
of those plants on line antypas said 
the proposed new reactors would rely heavily on passive 
design features to guard against a melting of the reactor core a 
gascooled reactor for example uses helium as a coolant instead of 
water and its core is encased in graphite this gives its operators 
more time to respond to problems because the gas cannot boil away 
and the graphite takes hours to reach a dangerous temperature 
antypas said that even if the advanceddesign reactors prove more 
safe and reliable than the current lightwater reactors the 
industry still will not have solved the problem of longterm 
disposal of wastes generated by the plants 
the group said more emphasis should be placed on improving energy 
efficiency in transportation buildings appliances and utilities 
instead of spending billions on new nuclear plants 
many in the nuclear industry believe that widespread adoption of 
the new reactor technologies is vital to restoring public confidence 
in the safety and efficiency of nuclear power

the house ways and means committee today 
approved trade concessions for poland and hungary two sovietbloc 
nations that president bush will visit next month 
with no debate or dissent the committee agreed to a bill that 
makes exports from poland eligible for dutyfree treatment under the 
generalized system of preferences 
the house quickly gave the measure approval by voice vote and 
sent it to the senate 
a second bill approved by the ways and means committee by voice 
vote would allow a fiveyear extension of mostfavorednation trade 
status to hungary that has the effect of suspending a law that bars 
trade concessions to certain communist nations until the united 
states is satisfied they have liberalized emigration policies 
that 1974 law known as the jacksonvanik amendment usually 
requires that any exemption be reviewed every year rep richard 
schulze rpa complained because the suspension for hungarys 
benefit would be subject to a review only after five years 
we take a very important step when we change jacksonvanik 
schulze said its symbolic around the world 
rep sam gibbons dfla who chairs the committees trade 
subcommittee said the fiveyear suspension is justified because no 
emigration complaints against hungary are pending hungary of all 
nations has demonstrated its continued interest in freedom he 
said 
few american investors are willing to put their money into 
hungary and take the risk of having the united states withdraw trade 
concessions after only a year gibbons added 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the committee said it 
is expected that congress will complete action on the concessions 
this week

sculptor and philosopher ernst neizvestny who 
emigrated from the soviet union in 1976 said tuesday that karl marx 
was a good critic of 19th century capitalism but a bad prophet 
neizvestny who gained fame for his differences over art with 
former soviet leader nikita s khrushchev spoke to about 500 people 
as part of a moscow summer school series of lectures on democracy 
freedom and freemarket economics 
the artist did not elaborate on marx whose prediction that 
capitalism will inevitably selfdestruct into communism is taught to 
every schoolchild in the soviet union the audience responded to the 
comment with quiet laughter and grunts of acknowledgement 
neizvestny had a rocky relationship with khrushchev they met 
when the soviet leader came to a rare exhibition of modern art and 
termed neizvestnys work garbage the sculptor strode up and 
started arguing 
khrushchev later asked neizvestny to create his grave monument 
which marks the final resting place of the former soviet leader in 
novodevichy cemetery in moscow 
the 64yearold sculptor told his audience the flood of famous 
soviet artists and performers who have left their homeland will stop 
when they are certain they can leave the soviet union and know they 
can return and then leave again 
i always had a fear of being parochial for lack of the 
ability to travel he said emigration clearly solved that he said 
but he also found that his life in the soviet union left him 
afraid only of prison and death so lessserious difficulties such 
as poverty or the opinions of others have had little effect 
the lecture was arranged by the american foreign policy council 
and a group seeking to establish an american university in moscow

a house committee on tuesday passed legislation 
that would limit civil contempt of court jailings in the district of 
columbia a bill designed to help a mother who has been jailed 22 
months in a child custody dispute 
elizabeth morgan a prominent plastic surgeon was jailed by dc 
superior court judge herbert dixon after she refused to tell him 
where she had sent her sixyearold daughter hilary he has said 
repeatedly he will not lift his contempt citation until she gives 
the information 
morgan has been trying to prevent any visit between the child and 
eric foretich the girls father morgan has accused foretich her 
former husband of sexually abusing the child he has repeatedly 
denied it 
the legislation designed to apply retroactively to morgans 
case would limit civil contempt jailings in the district to 12 
months unless the judge in the case changes the charge to criminal 
contempt a charge that would require a trial people could be held 
on criminal contempt charges during the trial but not longer than 
18 months 
the bill also requires that a different judge hear the criminal 
contempt charges 
we do not seek to place a limitation on the amount of time an 
individual can be sentenced to serve if convicted of criminal 
contempt said rep stan parris rva a cosponsor of the bill 
passed by the district of columbia committee our aim was to 
preserve the basic right of individuals to due process under the 
law 
nine of the members of the committee voted for the legislation 
with only rep mervyn dymally dcalif voting against it parris 
said the legislation is expected to go before the full house next 
week 
the panels action came a day after dixon ruled again that the 
mother must remain behind bars until she discloses the whereabouts 
of her daughter or turns the child over to the citys foster care 
department 
a district of columbia appeals court panel had directed dixon to 
justify his december 1988 decision to keep morgan in jail 
dixons latest ruling will now be reviewed by that threejudge 
panel 
foretichs attorney elaine mittleman said tuesday in a 
statement civil contempt does not transform into criminal 
contempt a crime such as obstruction of justice is much more 
suited to dr morgans offenses than is criminal contempt

physicians and childrens advocates told 
congress on tuesday that making more women eligible for medicaid 
prenatal care would help reduce the nations high rate of infant 
deaths 
however the states which share the cost of the health insurance 
program for the poor with the federal government opposed measures 
backed by the administration and members of congress requiring 
states to expand eligibility in their medicaid programs 
the administration is proposing to require states to admit to 
their medicaid programs women and infants with incomes up to 130 
percent of poverty sens lloyd bentsen dtexas and john chafee 
rri introduced a bill monday to require coverage for women and 
children up to 185 percent of poverty 
the need for prenatal care to reduce infant mortality has to be 
one of the nations most pressing problems bentsen said at 
tuesdays hearing of the senate finance committee which he chairs 
white american babies now die at a greater rate than babies 
born in singapore he said minority babies born in washington 
today have a greater chance of dying before their first birthday 
than babies in cuba 
the us infant mortality rate ranks 20th among industrialized 
nations according to the public health service 
a third of all pregnant women are not receiving prenatal care 
bentsen said and one in five children have no health insurance 
the best way to ensure that a child will begin life as healthy 
as possible is to ensure the health of the mother during pregnancy 
through prenatal care said kay johnson of the childrens defense 
fund 
richard h schwarz of the american college of obstetricians and 
gynecologists said the evidence is overwhelming that prenatal care 
reduces low birthweight this condition he said is associated with 
twothirds of neonatal deaths and 20 percent of postnatal deaths 
yet medicaid falls far short of meeting the healthcare needs of 
poor women and children witnesses said 
current law gives states until july 1 1990 to cover all 
pregnant women and infants with incomes below the poverty line 
fortyfour states now provide coverage to pregnant women and 
infants with family income below the poverty line and 15 states 
provide such coverage for women and infants with incomes up to 185 
percent of poverty according to the national governors association 
bentsens measure would require coverage for pregnant women and 
children up to age 6 with incomes below 185 percent of poverty or 
22385 for a family of four by jan 1 1991 it would add 300000 
women and 16 million children 
the change would cost about 1 billion annually a cost that 
would have to be matched by the states 
the administrations proposal would add a total of 374000 women 
and children to the program and would pay for the change by reducing 
state matching funds for administrative costs 
the states however oppose any further mandated eligibility 
requirements in the medicaid program said raymond c scheppach 
executive director of the national governors association 
in the last year and a half states have had to absorb the costs 
of sweeping changes in nursing home care and expanded benefits for 
the elderly he said 
yet states voluntarily have been moving to expand their medicaid 
programs to make more women infants and children eligible for 
benefits and will continue to make improvements as their budgets 
allow he said 
individual states are in the best position to decide how 
medicaid funds should be spent to assist citizens who are in need 
he said

president bush welcomes the soviet unions 
increased willingness to allow verification of nuclear weapons 
reductions and plans to build on that in new initiatives the chief 
us negotiator said tuesday 
negotiator richard burt declined to discuss bushs proposals in 
detail but said we have noticed that the soviets have taken a 
much more open and constructive approach on verification in recent 
years 
bushs proposal came monday in washington as the superpowers 
resumed strategic arms reduction talks in geneva after a sevenmonth 
recess 
the president said the united states and soviet union should 
begin testing verification procedures during negotiations on 
reducing longrange nuclear forces rather than waiting until a pact 
is completed 
such steps could involve trial inspections at each others 
missile sites and discussions about equipment needed for 
verification which bush said could be the most complex issue facing 
negotiators 
tuesdays editions of the washington post quoted an unidentified 
official in washington as saying negotiators plan to suggest 
aroundtheclock monitoring of some ballistic missile factories and 
onsite checks of missile warheads to start before any new 
agreement the proposal also was reported to include a ban on some 
missile flight tests 
burt said that another aim of bushs plan is to build support for 
senate ratification of a future arms treaty 
several superpower arms control treaties including the 1979 salt 
ii pact on limiting longrange nuclear arsenals remained unratified 
because the senate decided the verification provisions were lax 
burt said progress on verification would not become a condition 
in the start talks 
we will continue to move on all fronts he said we are not 
proposing these measures as a takeitorleaveit package 
the talks aimed at reducing us and soviet longrange bombers 
missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent are the 
latest round in negotiations that began four years ago 
burt said at the news conference that their aim is to speed 
resolution of outstanding issues and give added momentum toward 
completing a treaty 
under soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs philosophy of more 
openness moscow has allowed western experts to tour a soviet 
chemical weapons site for the first time as part of efforts to 
negotiate a global ban 
us and soviet scientists also have exchanged visits to each 
others nuclear testing sites to examine ways of monitoring two 
1970s treaties limiting atomic blasts that the senate never approved 
burt confirmed that the bush administrations review of arms 
policy did not result in a change in the strategic defense 
initiative which calls for spacebased missile defenses a divisive 
issue since arms talks began

a house armed services subcommittee voted 
tuesday to accept defense secretary dick cheneys 69 billion 
procurement budget with no addons endorsing a proposal from the 
panels democratic chairman by a slim margin 
the procurement and military nuclear systems subcommittee by a 
vote of 109 approved the amendment of rep les aspin dwis who 
had urged members to give cheney a vote of confidence and prevent 
addons totaling 72 billion 
the full house armed services committee will vote on the 
amendment next week 
while the budget may not be perfect its a darn good product 
especially given the 39 days dick cheney had to put it together 
aspin told the panel 
aspin and two other democrats ike skelton of missouri and 
richard ray of georgia joined seven of the panels eight 
republicans in approving the measure 
rep robert w davis of ohio was the lone gop member to vote 
against the plan which basically removes the right of members to 
rewrite the 300 billion fiscal 1990 budget to restore local 
projects canceled by cheney 
pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said he was pleased to hear about 
the vote 
aspin refused to give odds on the measures chance of winning 
approval in the full committee but called the subcommittees 
acceptance of a budget that terminates programs staggering 
some democratic members complained that approval of the measure 
could signal the end of the subcommittees authority 
a yes vote would be abrogating ourselves out of business 
said rep frank mccloskey dind who voted against the amendment 
rep norman sisisky dva who also opposed the amendment said 
approval was not a vote of confidence for cheney because there was 
no guarantee that the defense budget wouldnt be changed on the 
house floor 
i think im giving up my rights if i have to vote for something 
that i can only change on the floor sisisky said i think were 
making a big mistake and it has nothing to do with a vote of 
confidence 
some members have pressed for restoring the navy f14d tomcat 
fighter and marine v22 osprey which cheney canceled at the 
expense of other projects if restored the f14d would add 366 
million and the v22 700 million 
other possible addons include 55 million in new equipment for 
the navy p3 antisubmarine aircraft 436 million for air force 
c130s and 240 million for heavy trucks made in oshkosh wis 
mccloskey argued that although aspin didnt strongarm his 
democratic colleagues on the amendment there are people on that 
side who are very much for the osprey that have been 
strongarmed by the secretary of defense 
rep john g rowland rconn said no one on this side of the 
aisle was strongarmed 
cheney former house republican whip who served as representative 
from wyoming has the mildest softest touches on the hill 
rowland said 
aspin said after the vote that lobbying was fierce on both sides 
with president bush and the northrop corp pushing for adoption of 
the amendment 
northrop which manufactures the b2 stealth bomber fears losing 
funds for its program to support other defense projects 
lobbying against the plan were grumman corp builder of the 
f14 and the alumni association of the marine corps backers of the 
v22 osprey 
shortly after the vote rep thomas j downey dny said he 
would fight to save the f14 which is manufactured in bethpage 
long island

the navy has accepted the citys invitation 
to reschedule a mock beach assault that was canceled after religious 
and peace groups opposed it 
the city council after hearing emotional testimony during a 
meeting monday night voted 63 to extend the invitation 
lt commander luanne smith executive officer of the navy 
recruiting district in minneapolis said tuesday the navy will 
contact city officials soon about reviving the park point mock 
assault 
the exercise involving 200 marines was to be part of a recruiting 
and goodwill visit july 2123 by the boulder a tank landing ship 
city council president joyce benson and members of several 
religious and peace groups earlier had persuaded the navy to cancel 
the show many had complained that it would glorify war and damage 
the lake superior beach 
the councils action followed emotional testimony by veterans and 
peace activists 
those in favor of the mock assault argued that the military needs 
such exercises to train some said such shows instill valuable pride 
in the military enhance recruiting and demonstrate strength 
if youre strong nobody will muck around with you said 
veteran harvey solon 
those against the assault said it would glorify violence falsely 
advertise military jobs as glamorous and advocate wasting money that 
could be spent on social needs 
the real issue is political said veteran mark skinner 
this is a demonstration on the part of the pentagon to get support 
for military spending

a consultant with ties to former president reagan 
helped a minnesota housing project secure funding last year after 
federal housing officials rejected the plan a newspaper reported 
today 
the consultant robert weinberger is a nephew of former defense 
secretary caspar weinberger and was an aide to reagan when he was 
governor of california the new york times reported 
weinberger told the associated press tuesday he hadnt done 
anything out of the ordinary in approaching lawmakers on behalf of 
the developer and rejected implications he used personal influence 
on behalf of his client 
robert weinberger is the latest on a growing list of prominent 
republicans who successfully represented developers seeking help 
from the department of housing and urban development the times said 
the times said documents show that after the hud office in 
minneapolis rejected a plan for the agency to provide mortgage 
insurance for a 5 million housing project for the elderly in st 
paul a handwritten note from hud secretary samuel r pierce on aug 
23 said his senior staff would give very careful consideration 
to an appeal from the developers 
the note responded to a letter dated aug 22 from sen pete 
wilson rcalif who had asked pierce to reconsider the project 
less than two weeks later the documents showed the minneapolis 
office decision was reversed 
weinberger said he asked several elected officials including 
both minnesota senators and a congressman to query hud about the 
case and said that is standard procedure for a consultant seeking 
review of a project 
the implication is that i called my uncle and he called 
pierce weinberger told the associated press thats garbage i 
never talked to my uncle on that trip we talk but its always about 
family matters we have an unwritten rule about that 
weinberger said he contacted wilsons staff because the 
california senator serves on the select committee on aging and 
because he knows wilson 
weinberger said he and his firm in laguna niguel calif 
received about 15000 in fees for its work on the project 
weinberger who said his share of the fee was a few thousand 
dollars said his firm does consulting and lobbying work for 
health care businesses mostly with the state legislature but also 
in washington 
we were hired not for influence but for our understanding of 
the process he said 
developer richard l webb said he and his partners hired 
weinberger to get some political influence some political 
interest in our appeal so that the hud people would consider it 
the minneapolis hud office rejected the project because of what 
officials there said was a relatively weak market for housing for 
the elderly 
the 68unit project a blend of apartment buildings and a 
convalescent hospital now under construction is called rosewood 
estates

francisco street residents are tired of 
living in fear because of rampant drug dealing and prostitution in 
their neighborhood so theyre fighting back in small claims court 
fifteen homeowners and renters have filed mental anguish claims 
for 2000 each against the owner of the fiveunit apartment 
building residents contend is the wellspring of neighborhood crime 
illicit sex and drugs all linked to sales of cheap potent crack 
cocaine 
instead of soda cans and drifting newspapers the neighborhood of 
modest victorians and new condominiums has been littered with used 
syringes and condoms 
i cant walk down the street anytime said elisa flores 18 
people think im a prostitute 
her 15yearold brother was robbed at gunpoint one neighbor 
found a bloody syringe next to his childs swing a second 
encountered a prostitute having sex on a picnic bench outside his 
back door at noon 
kenneth martin who has lived in the area for four years said 
the neighborhood was being ruined by drug dealing on the sidewalks 
and prostitution in the schoolyard constant traffic and the sounds 
of fighting inside two apartments linked to narcotics sales 
our purpose is not to gouge anyone for lots of money but to 
get the criminality removed martin said 
bonnie perocier who has lived on francisco street for 29 years 
said her car has been broken into twice and items have been stolen 
from her garage she said a man across the street was burglarized 
twice by thieves who ripped his deadbolt locks off with crowbars 
he came back sunday morning and even his underwear was gone 
and he was wondering what he was going to wear to work perocier 
said 
residents say the drug and crime problems have grown worse in the 
past year and a half 
the small claims filed in berkeleyalbany municipal court blame 
the apartment building owner for negligence creating a nuisance and 
endangering the neighborhood judge jennie rhine will receive final 
evidence in the case wednesday and will rule later 
martin said the small claims idea stemmed from news about a 
successful lawsuit by south san francisco homeowners against airport 
officials who promised to abate noise but failed to follow through 
police spokesman capt bobby miller said the twostory apartment 
building in the middle of the block is wellknown to police who 
have served search warrants and made arrests there 
molly wetzel who lives across the street said she contacted 
owner percy davis about the problems there several times since last 
october 
davis attorney michael sims contends davis filed a notice on 
april 18 to evict the alleged troublemakers sims said davis 
complained that berkeleys strict rent control law makes eviction 
difficult 
about the troublesome tenants sims said davis isnt accepting 
any responsibility for their criminal behavior 
repeated calls to davis were not returned 
martin said the apartment tenants have been evicted or have 
agreed to move soon all we know is that the problem is at last 
being solved he said 
i know mr davis now has promised to clean this situation up 
but the time it has taken has ruined our lives said the resident 
who found the bloody syringe he did not want to be identified 
the neighborhood in berkeleys flatlands about a mile west of 
the university of california campus has long had crime problems 
because of a busy thoroughfare nearby residents acknowledge that 
getting new neighbors in the apartment building wont eliminate all 
of their problems but it will help 
we will not do away with the petty kind of burglary that you 
have everywhere in west berkeley but the problems of prostitution 
and fear on the street definitely will go away martin said if 
it can stay clean a year i believe it will be solved

the house on tuesday approved an eightmonth 
extension of the strategic petroleum reserve the nations energy 
life jacket in the event of a repeat of the 197374 arab oil embargo 
on a voice vote the house authorized the energy department to 
continue filling the reserve with 60000 to 78000 barrels of oil 
daily through next february but postponed decisions on several key 
issues on how the stockpile may be used 
the senate approved similar legislation two weeks ago but 
extended the program for another five years and raised the ceiling 
on the reserve from 750 million barrels to 1 billion barrels early 
in the next century 
in response to oil price surges after the exxon valdez tanker 
spill in alaska two months ago the senate also expanded president 
bushs authority to tap the reserve for domestic as well as foreign 
supply interruptions 
the house included none of those measures in its bill saying it 
wanted to give its energy and commerce committee as well as the 
energy department time to weigh the implications of any new policy 
directions 
if the senate refuses to accept the housepassed bill a 
conference committee would be named to develop a compromise version 
if both chambers approve the compromise the legislation would be 
sent to bush 
while endorsing the effort to give bush more authority and 
flexibility on when he could tap the reserve in order to suppress 
sudden price spikes for oil the administration had sought only a 
simple fiveyear extension of the program 
since the reserve was begun in 1975 some 570 million barrels of 
oil slightly less than a 90day supply of us imports at current 
levels have been put into storage in salt caverns on the texas and 
louisiana coasts

the state department on tuesday rejected a 
nicaraguan offer to hold talks on improving relations saying that 
there can be no accommodation unless certain conditions are met 
including free and fair elections 
nicaraguan president daniel ortega said monday he had asked 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo to go to washington with the 
governments proposal for opening talks on normalizing relations 
there have been no substantive talks between officials of the two 
countries in more than four years 
state department press officer rudi boone said an improvement in 
relations depends on holding free and fair elections under 
international supervision the beginning of a genuine dialogue with 
the nicaraguan opposition and an end to nicaraguan support for 
subversion in the region 
the bush administration has accused the sandinista government of 
increasing its support for leftist rebels in el salvador 
the administration also has been exerting heavy diplomatic and 
economic pressure on nicaragua to ensure that opposition parties are 
able to compete fairly in national elections set for next february 
boone said nicaraguas professed intention of improving relations 
contrasts sharply with several recent actions by the sandinista 
government including the expulsion of two us diplomats 
the envoys were accused of fomenting labor unrest but the state 
department has insisted they engaged in no wrongdoing 
after his meeting monday with obando y bravo ortega told 
reporters he had asked the prelate to mediate with president bush 
so that a fluid dialogue can develop we are willing to develop a 
dialogue with the north american government so foundations can be 
laid for normalizing relations between nicaragua and the united 
states 
although the united states no longer provides military aid to the 
nicaraguan resistance a us trade embargo imposed five years ago 
remains in effect and has contributed to the countrys steep 
economic decline

house and senate negotiators on tuesday 
resolved a key difference in bills to remove all federal price 
controls on natural gas by jan 1 1993 
the compromise bill is expected to be signed by president bush 
within a few weeks it is not expected to have a noticeable effect 
on retail prices for natural gas because most gas under controls 
already is selling below the official ceilings 
the energy industry supports decontrol while some consumer 
groups oppose it some other consumer groups however have taken 
what amounts to a neutral position 
the only difference between the original house and senate bills 
was in treatment of natural gas from newly drilled wells the senate 
version had no provision for early deregulation of gas from such 
wells whereas the house wanted to lift price controls on them 
retroactive to march 23 1989 
in a compromise the negotiators agreed that gas from wells 
drilled after the date of enactment of the legislation would be 
deregulated on may 15 1991 all other gas not already decontrolled 
would be freed from the federal ceilings upon the renegotiation of 
sales contracts or jan 1 1993 whichever comes first 
about twothirds of the nations natural gas was deregulated by 
the 1978 natural gas policy act 
natural gas accounts for about onequarter of the nations energy 
use 
the bush administration strongly supports complete decontrol 
contending that it will stimulate more exploration for a fuel source 
needed to limit dependence on foreign oil 
the house passed its original bill in april while the senate 
bill was passed earlier this month the compromise bill must be 
voted on by both houses again before it is sent to the white house

ernest and julio gallo owners of the 
worlds largest winery won the right tuesday to keep the younger 
brother they raised from using his own name as a trademark for his 
own cheese 
a federal judge concluded that use of the name joseph gallo on 
retail cheese is misleading because many consumers assume the brand 
is connected with e amp j gallo winery joseph gallo sells about 
10000 tons of grapes a year from his vineyards to his brothers but 
has no other connection with their winery based at modesto 90 
miles southeast of san francisco 
there is substantial evidence of actual confusion us 
district judge robert e coyle wrote citing retailers who asked if 
the cheese and wine were connected 
however the judges permanent injunction permits joseph gallo to 
use his name as a signature or in block letters below the words 
designating the variety of cheese if the label also includes a 
prominent trademark above that does not include the word gallo 
joseph gallos attorney denis rice of san francisco said he 
expects to win on appeal he criticized coyle for appearing to use 
arguments by winery attorneys verbatim in his brief and failing to 
submit a decision separate from the findings and injunction 
rice said the findings failed to deal adequately with the 
question of whether a person is entitled to use his own full name 
on his own product 
however coyles findings addressed the dilemma of using a common 
name that also is a wellknown brand 
if every person named gallo were entitled to use gallo as a 
consumer trademark gallo might be adopted as a trademark on any 
imaginable product coyle wrote such proliferation of uses 
would destroy the unique nature of the gallo brand its 
distinctiveness and its commercial value 
a monthlong trial last fall offered rare glimpses of the 
familyowned winerys development from a provider of bulk wines 
without a brand during the depression to fame and fortune for its 
cheap wines first thunderbird in the 1950s later the gallo brand 
itself gallo winerys sales now total 1 billion a year 
a gallo attorney said during an opening statement that in 1933 
six weeks after their father killed ther mother then committed 
suicide ernest and julio gallo began making wine with knowledge 
gained from a book they got at the public library julio now 79 
has handled the winemaking ever since while ernest 80 became a 
widely recognized marketing expert 
even though they raised younger brother joseph now 67 after the 
deaths of their parents the winery gallos sued him after he began 
using his name on cheese in the mid 1980s 
winery attorney oliver wanger said tuesday that ernest and julio 
had to protect their trademark and a licensing agreement that let 
gallo salami co use the gallo name on cheese under an agreement by 
which winery inspectors checked that brands quality gallo salami 
co has no other connection to the three gallo brothers 
wanger said ernest and julio were reluctant to sue their brother 
but were rebuffed when they offered to license him to use the gallo 
trademark if the winery were allowed reasonable quality control over 
his cheese 
coyle also commented on the issue of quality control saying the 
winery and gallo salami have reasonable grounds to be concerned 
that sale of cheeses by defendants under the joseph gallo brand 
creates an undue and unnecessary risk of a serious health problem 
resulting from the sale of joseph gallobrand cheese that may injure 
the gallo brand

president bush offered to drop a usproposed 
ban on mobile nuclear missiles tuesday if congress goes along with 
his plan to build both the midgetman and mx mobile missiles 
intensifying his drive for upgrading us strategic forces bush 
told congressional leaders dont pull the rug out from under us 
on the twomissile plan according to presidential press secretary 
marlin fitzwater 
bushs willingness to abandon the mobilemissile ban at the 
negotiating table in geneva could enhance chances for congressional 
passage of his missilebuilding package claimed senate armed 
services committee chairman sam nunn dga 
nunn who had criticized bush for failing to make a strongenough 
case for his twomissile program said he came away from a white 
house meeting very encouraged about the future of both missiles 
bushs comments relayed by participants at the meeting as well 
as by fitzwater signal a key modification of position for the white 
house in strategic arms reduction talks known as start that 
resumed on monday in geneva after a sevenmonth hiatus 
we would be prepared to adjust our position on the ban 
accordingly if congress gives the goahead to both the mx and 
midgetman proposals fitzwater said 
however he said in the absence of such congressional approval 
the us position favoring a ban on mobile longrange nuclear 
weapons would remain on the table 
on capitol hill meanwhile sen joseph biden ddel complained 
to secretary of state james a baker iii about the emphasis the bush 
administration was giving to the issue of verification 
us negotiators in geneva are under instruction to try to work 
out some arrangements to insure compliance with an eventual treaty 
biden told baker the administration is risking a major blunder 
with no potential gain the senator said concentrating on 
anticheating safeguards could divert attention from such major 
issues as reducing weapons arsenals 
the result biden said could be indefinitely postponing 
completion of an accord 
baker assured biden there was no ulterior motive in trying to 
pin down verification measures in fact he said one purpose was to 
accelerate senate ratification of the treaty by discussing 
enforcement with the soviets in advance 
the proposal to ban all mobile nuclear missile systems was made 
by the reagan administration and embraced until tuesday by the bush 
administration it would apply to both the 10warhead mx missile and 
the onewarhead midgetman as well as to their soviet counterparts 
including the multiplewarhead ss24s 
however the administration found itself in the position of 
advocating such a ban in geneva while arguing on capitol hill for 
more mobilemissile deployment 
bush in april proposed spending 12 billon next year to begin 
placing 50 existing mx missiles on rail cars and another 100 
million as a first installment on a 25 billion program to build the 
truckbased midgetman by 1997 
however the plan has run into considerable opposition in 
congress both among those who contend the twinmissile program is 
too expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other 
fitzwater said we think a mobile capability is essential then 
you negotiate reductions as best you can 
he said that moving ahead on both the mx and midgetman missiles 
would give the united states more leverage at the geneva talks 
he compared pressing ahead with the two mobile missile systems 
against the backdrop of the talks to reduce strategic weapons with 
the us decision to go ahead with deployment of intermediaterange 
cruise missiles during negotiations that led to the 1987 ussoviet 
treaty to ban such weapons 
if congress does pass those mx and midgetman then they would 
become part of our negotiations in geneva fitzwater said 
nunn said he was satisfied by the outcome of the white house 
session 
i think its very clear that the president the secretary of 
state and the secretary of defense were willing and indeed indicated 
they would reexamine the geneva position on banning mobile missiles 
if congress approves both the mx railmobile and the midgetman 
funding he said 
they made it clear however that they were not going to end up 
in a position permiting mobile missiles if congress was not going to 
fund mobile missiles nunn added 
nunn also said he strongly supported the administrations 
proposal that efforts to reach agreement on verification procedures 
be nailed down between us and soviet negotiators at the outset of 
talks on controlling longrange missiles 
sen john warner rva senior republican on the armed services 
committee lauded the presidents position 
warner said bush clearly told us that if the congress can get 
its act together and support the president on both programs then 
the question of mobility would be revisited by the administration 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash told reporters it 
remains to be seen whether bushs strong pitch for his twomissile 
plan would help it overcome opposition in congress

tuesday said he will not run for reelection in december 
im a bad candidate at this time because should i run i

running saying he would run if the people ask for it 
on tuesday he said flatly i will not run in the december

trucks hauling food could not carry garbage 
under a bill introduced in the house by rep chris smith rnj to 
head off what he said was a growing health hazard 
drivers who are bringing meat produce and grain products from 
the midwest to the east coast are often returning with bales of 
solid waste to be disposed of in landfills smith said 
smiths bill would require the department of transportation to 
adopt regulations prohibiting any vehicle that carries solid waste 
or hazardous waste from being used to transport food 
violators would be punished with criminal penalties of up to 
350000 and five years in jail 
in a oneminute address to the house on monday smith said that 
the practice of carrying both food and garbage appears to be 
increasing as landfills in eastern states reach capacity 
new jersey produces about 15000 tons or 750 truckloads of 
solid waste daily to be sent to landfills in western pennsylvania 
and ohio smith said 
although these trucks must be licensed by new jersey to haul 
garbage within or out of state there are no requirements which 
prevent these same trucks from returning with a cargo of food

the armed services have yet to detect any 
safety problems because of the alleged illegal substitution of scrap 
metal for designated alloys in engines for 5000 military aircraft 
the pentagon said tuesday 
according to a fraud indictment monday in tampa fla of three 
former executives of aerodyne investment casings inc the company 
used scrap in making turbine blades of the type used in 22000 jet 
aircraft helicopters and tanks 
now its estimated that 5000 aircraft have been equipped with 
these parts since 1982 said pentagon spokesman pete williams 
two million hours have been accrued on the aircraft without any 
known related incidents 
there has been no noticeable degradation in performance using 
that 50percent mixture 
the blades were used in t53 engine thats used on the huey 
cobra and mohawk helicopters for the army he said 
the army suspended the contractor last aug 16 because of the 
evidence of aerodynes use of nonspecified alloys in making parts 
said brown 
the grand jury indicted three former aerodyne executives russell 
k baker sr and russell k baker jr and carman eugene alexander 
williams said the alleged fraud was discovered by the defense 
departments inspector general who notified the military services 
and the defense logistics agency 
since then a new source has been since required to produce the 
parts said williams 
it was not immediately clear what steps the services had taken to 
cope with the alleged substitution

a senate committee approved a bill tuesday 
designed to deal with oil spills and try to prevent them through 
such steps as random alcohol testing of crews and improved radar 
systems for tracking tankers 
the oil tanker navigation safety act of 1989 deals directly with 
alaskas prince william sound where exxon continues cleaning up a 
massive spill and would also affect tanker operations elsewhere 
meanwhile transporation secretary samuel skinner announced a 
comprehensive inspection of the 800mile alaska pipeline he 
indicated that the march 24 rupture of the exxon valdez oil tanker 
prompted the inspection originally set for 1991 
the exxon valdez oil spill has taught us a valuable lesson the 
need to avoid complacency when it comes to protecting our 
environment skinner said 
he said the inspection will review operating pressures repair 
procedures protective coating requirements routine inspection 
schedules and the electric current used to retard corrosion along 
with oil spill contingency plans for the pipeline 
skinner also sent congress a proposed bill to give the coast 
guard broader authority over mariners including revocation of their 
certification if they have a record of drunken driving 
that and several other provisions already were in the bill 
approved without opposition by the senate commerce science and 
transportation committee 
the bill backed by sen ted stevens ralaska would open 
highway driving records of merchant mariners to the coast guard 
provide for random and other alcohol testing of people in 
safetysenstive jobs on tankers and improve radar systems to aid the 
tracking of ships through potentially hazardous areas 
it also requires the secretary of transportation to examine 
several other safety steps and sets guidelines for oil spill 
contingency plans including requiring some oil spill cleanup 
equipment to be prepositioned at strategic locations and other 
equipment to be carried aboard tankers 
the legislation consolidating six proposed bills arising from 
three senate hearings on the alaska spill was sent to the full 
senate as the oil industry unveiled its own plan for responding to 
major spills 
the industry announced it would spend 250 million to set up a 
network of response teams capable of handling an accident as large 
as the march 24 disaster involving the exxon valdez 
the senate bill would require at least three persons to be on the 
bridge of a tanker in certain waters including the sound the exxon 
valdezs captain had gone below deck and turned the helm over to his 
third mate who was not licensed to navigate the sound the captain 
joseph hazelwood faces several charges in connection with the 
incident 
the senate measure would allow suspension of a merchant marines 
license following a hearing for being drunk on the job or if there 
is a record of a highway drivers license being suspended or revoked 
within the previous five years for alcohol or drug use 
the legislation instructs the transportation secretary to examine 
whether newly constructed tankers should be built with double hulls 
or double bottoms and also to conduct a study of whether the size of 
tankers being built is a factor in oil spills the exxon valdez 
carried over 50 million gallons 
sen slade gorton rwash said he would propose on the senate 
floor an amendment that would impose financial punishment on 
companies responsible for oil spills including a possible giving up 
of all profits for one year if in a case of gross or willful 
negligence the money would go into an environmental fund

president bushs committee to enhance us 
trade competitiveness began work tuesday as vice president dan 
quayle promised to shore up us interests against the consolidation 
of european markets 
quayle chairman of the council on competitiveness said the 
european communitys plan to restructure its economies into a single 
european market by 1992 has caused concern among us businesses 
i share some of those concerns but fundamentally ec92 is both 
a challenge and an opportunity for the united states he said in a 
speech to the national foreign trade council the national 
association of manufacturers and the coalition for employment 
through exports 
the council on competitiveness quayle said will review federal 
laws to ensure they dont unfairly restrict us companies against 
european competitors 
the vice president said the council also would ensure united 
states access to and fair competition in the single european market 
and would reevaluate policies on deregulation of financial 
institutions and antitrust restrictions 
american companies complain that antitrust measures prevent them 
from competing fairly because european countries are not restrained 
by the same standards 
many of the antitrust policies are anachronistic in this age of 
global competition quayle said adding that merger law reform is 
needed 
we need to consider reducing present incentives for price 
antitrust litigation he said 
the vice president said the area of biotechnology in which the 
united states has been a leader will be reviewed 
the key to our success in marketing new biotechnology products 
has been a sensible regulatory regime that applies basic 
competitiveness principles he said but cautioned against 
unnecessary regulatory burdens on product development 
we need to consider ways to improve incentives for private 
sector investment quayle said citing bushs proposal to reduce 
the capital gains tax make permanent tax credit payments for 
research and development and ease the patent applications process 
the council on competitiveness whose members include cabinet 
members involved with trade issues was set up by bush to continue 
the work of president reagans task force reagans task force dealt 
with eliminating excessive government regulation

the bush administration in a policy shift from 
the reagan era has decided that the government will pay the full 
cost of readying new weapons for production pentagon officials said 
tuesday 
for the past eight years government and defense contractors have 
split the development cost of most weapons systems that policy will 
change the new no 2 pentagon official deputy defense secretary 
donald j atwood revealed in a published interview 
atwoods proposal was embodied in a pentagon management review 
that defense secretary dick cheney approved and sent to the white 
house on tuesday acording to other pentagon officials the policy 
change does not require congressional review 
were just going to implement it said atwood 
the old system does not encourage defense contractors to develop 
the most efficient weapons and means of producing them atwood said 
it encourages them to skimp he said in an interview with the 
washington post 
pentagon officials distributed the text on tuesday 
the consequence is lo and behold we end up in production with 
something thats difficult to build we didnt put the time and 
effort into it said atwood a former executive at general motors 
corp 
he did not offer any specific examples but the pentagon has had 
trouble in recent years in the performance of several costly weapons 
the development contract said atwood is when you should put 
your effort into designing it for simplicity and producibility of 
designing it for reliability and performance and quality and it is 
not the time you skimp that is the whole purpose 
the shift which is likely to be hailed by the defense industry 
will not affect existing contracts on major weapons systems such as 
the b2 stealth bomber or a new class of attack submarines 
but pentagon officials said in a statement that future contracts 
for fullscale development of the air forces new advanced 
technology fighter may reflect the change in contract policy 
in outlining the new policy atwood distinguished between 
research that contractors pursue on various weaponsrelated 
technologies and the money they spend developing actual weapons for 
the government 
i think the government should pay the bill for the development 
phase he said by the development i mean the earlyon 
demonstration validation phase and for the fullscale 
development 
now i dont want to hold out any bonanza to any industry that 
thinks well well get all the money we want quite the 
contrary he said

the energy department confirmed tuesday it will 
make a closer study of environmental risks posed by a prototype 
plutonium refinery a move that a house panel chairman says will 
delay start of plant construction at least two years 
the department has called the plant a key to modernization of the 
nations nuclear weapons production complex it would use a new 
laser technology to convert existing military stockpiles of 
fuelgrade plutonium to weapongrade material 
rep john spratt dsc chairman of a special armed services 
committee panel said energy secretary james d watkins had made the 
decision in response to an environmental groups threat last april 
to sue to force such a study 
will callicott a department spokesman said watkins had notified 
selected members of congress of his decison on monday and tuesday 
although no general announcement was made 
the move was made callicott said because of our own wish to 
put any public doubt to rest as to the environmental safeguards 
for the project he declined to say how long the environmental 
study would delay the refinery project 
spratt said watkins had committed the department to conducting a 
formal environmental impact statement on the prototype which is 
being built at the departments lawrence livermore national 
laboratory near san francisco 
the livermore project is a prototype for a permanent plutonium 
refinery called the special isotope separation plant that the 
department wants to build at the idaho national engineering 
laboratory near idaho falls 
an environmental study of the idaho site already has been 
completed 
spratts panel which is reviewing energy department plans for 
modernizing the nuclear weapons complex and cleaning up its 
hazardous wastes last week voted to recommend withholding funds for 
beginning construction at idaho falls in 1990 
in a statement announcing watkins decision spratt said he was 
pleased by the move 
it signifies to the people of livermore and vicinity that their 
concerns for health and safety are shared by the department of 
energy and more broadly it is a tangible sign of what secretary 
watkins calls a change of culture at doe he said 
the natural resources defense council which notified the 
department last april that it would sue if an environmental 
assessment were not performed said it was pleased by the decision 
we scored a victory said dan reicher of the council its 
a combination of the strong position we believe we have plus 
congressional pressure 
spratt said it would take at least 12 months to finish the 
environmental study and that the start of construction at idaho 
falls is likely to be delayed at least two years

the united states can conduct star wars 
research and development far more cheaply than the bush 
administration is proposing acording to a congressional report 
released tuesday 
the three types of budget options described in the congressional 
budget office report would cost 113 billion to 184 billion from 
1990 to 1994 rather than the 311 billion proposed by president 
bush for the same period 
if we spend billions on strategic defense that does not really 
defend us and siphon these billions from the budgets of fighter 
planes ships tanks and personnel we may not make the country 
more secure said rep john spratt dsc a member of the house 
armed services committee who requested the report for this 
reason the cbo report bears careful study 
bush cut spending on the strategic defense initiative to 46 
billion for fiscal 1990 down from the 59 billion proposed by 
former president reagan 
defense secretary dick cheney has also said bush will shift the 
focus of star wars from deployment sometime in the 1990s to research 
on a more advanced system known as brilliant pebbles consisting 
of thousands of orbiting satellites 
under the reports first option the united states would be 
protected against a soviet breakthrough in technology or the 
kremlins deployment of a strategic defense system 
total spending would range from 113 billion to 145 billion 
and the option would be in compliance with the antiballistic 
missile treaty the report said 
the second option estimated at a cost of about 17 billion 
would enable the united states to defend parts of the country 
against a limited nuclear attack caused by an accident that option 
may comply with the abm treaty the report said 
the third option costing about 184 billion would provide a 
larger strategic defense system that would protect landbased 
missiles housed in silos such as the mx and midgetman 
the report estimates did not include the cost of procuring the 
system

a federal judge tuesday postponed the 
sentencing of oliver l north to consider allegations that one of 
the jurors who convicted the former presidential aide lied during 
jury selection 
us district judge gerhard a gesell set a hearing for june 28 
on defense allegations that juror tara king had used drugs before 
the trial and had failed during jury selection to disclose that 
three of her brothers had arrest records 
if the defense proves that it learned after the verdict that king 
deliberately withheld the information about her brothers during jury 
selection the judge might be forced to grant a mistrial 
gesell released defense pleadings about the allegation that had 
been filed under court seal 
they contained copies of district of columbia superior court 
records indicating that one of ms kings brothers samuel a king 
jr had an arrest record including a 1987 conviction for armed 
robbery 
two other brothers were arrested on other charges but the cases 
were dismissed 
a sister was involved in a childcustody suit with her estranged 
husband according to court records produced by the defense 
before the trial ms king indicated on a questionnaire for 
prospective jurors that no member of her family had ever been 
involved in a criminal or civil case either as a witness or as the 
subject of an investigation 
this apparently intentional misstatement raises serious 
questions as to juror bias and impartiality and suggests that 
defendant was deprived of his right to exercise peremptory and 
causal challenges in an informed manner norths lawyers said 
in another pleading unsealed by gesell norths lawyers said 
the possibility that a juror might have been under the influence 
of narcotics during trial calls into question the fairness of the 
proceeding and warrants further inquiry 
ms king told reporters after the verdict that she had used 
marijuana and cocaine before the trial but not while she sat on the 
jury that convicted north of three felony counts 
north a former white house aide had been scheduled to be 
sentenced friday he faces a possible 10year sentence for aiding 
and abetting in obstruction of congress destroying or mutilating 
official documents and accepting an illegal gratuity a security 
system outside his house from arms dealer richard v secord 
but gesell postponed sentencing until july 5 
after receiving the court documents about ms kings brothers 
the judge granted a motion by norths lawyers to reconsider his 
earlier refusal to hold a closed hearing on the defense allegations 
gesell directed norths lawyers to file a full written 
statement indicating the precise time and date when counsel first 
learned each fact documented in support of the request for 
reconsideration noting in each instance the name and address of 
each and every person supplying the information 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh contended in another brief 
unsealed tuesday that north has the burden of showing that his 
lawyers obtained the information about ms kings family after the 
may 4 verdict 
walsh noted that media reports during the trial that two other 
jurors had given incorrect answers to the same question by failing 
to disclose they had been parties to civil suits arising from

norths lawyers did not seek to dismiss either of those jurors 
and replace them with alternates 
walsh also suggested that kings false statement on the 
questionnaire may have been inadvertent because she has 14 brothers 
and sisters 
it was possible that any knowledge she did have simply did not 
come to mind at the time she completed the jury questionnaire 
walsh said he also pointed out that ms king is almost 17 years 
younger than the brother convicted of armed robbery 
the involvement of the jurors relatives in prior legal 
proceedings walsh argued gives rise to no inference that she 
harbored a bias against north 
if ms king developed any prejudice from such experiences it 
would likely be directed against the prosecution not defendants 
he said 
in a court filing on monday walsh asked gesell to imprison 
north saying the retired marine lieutenant colonel had not shown 
one iota of remorse and considered himself beyond reproach 
the prosecutor charged that north had lied on the witness stand 
concocting a false story to help win acquittal of a charge he 
pocketed 4300 in travelers checks that a nicaraguan rebel leader 
had entrusted in him

nine charges in all

hundreds of soldiers have failed to halt ethnic 
violence in a central asian city where weekend rioting killed three 
people and injured 53 soviet reports said tuesday 
the official tass news agency said authorities imposed a 9 pm 
to 6 am curfew and banned all rallies in novy uzen in the 
kazakhstan republic but clashes between warring groups of 
hoodlums are continuing in the town 
hundreds of soldiers were sent to novy uzen over the weekend to 
quell the fighting in the city that is an isolated gas and oil 
refining center in the harsh caspian desert 
interior ministry spokesman boris mikhailov said the rioting 
began friday night in novy uzen and was aimed at minorities 
originally from the caucasus mountain region on the other side of 
the caspian sea 
it was the third outbreak of violence in the past six weeks in 
soviet central asia the region has been buffeted by a soaring 
population pollution a shortage of jobs and rising ethnic tensions 
about 100 people were killed earlier this month during 10 days of 
arson and attacks directed against the meskhi turk minority in 
neighboring uzbekistan where uzbeks form the majority 
in turkmenia a republic south of kazakhstan mobs rampaged 
through the streets in early may demanding that cooperatives be 
closed and armenian traders be forced to leave the area 
official reports said most of the violence in novy uzen was 
against armenians azerbaijanis and lezgins who make up about 20000 
of the citys population of 56000 people with kazakhs in the 
majority 
mikhailov said about 7000 people gathered monday in the citys 
main square demanding that cooperative businesses be closed and 
people from the caucasus republics be sent home 
two battalions of interior ministry soldiers were brought in 
to stop the unrest he said the crowd was dispersed but it 
broke into several large groups of youths armed with pipes and 
stones and other objects they went along the streets organizing 
brawls pogroms and arson 
mikhailov said three people were killed and 53 injured according 
to preliminary reports and there were 57 arrests tass said said two 
kazakhs and one lezgin were killed 
official reports said the trouble began with a fight between 
ethnic groups at a dance hundreds of young people roamed the 
streets breaking windows and setting fire to cars and buildings 
tass reported 59 shops were damaged five cars burned and many 
windows broken 
it said soldiers fired in the air and used cheremukha a chemical 
substance similar to tear gas to break up the mobs the military 
has said cheremukha was used when troops crushed a proindependence 
protest in tbilisi georgia on april 9 twenty people were killed 
in the violence 
more than 700 people mostly women and children were evacuated 
from novy uzen to a heavily guarded bus station 8 miles from the 
city mikhailov said 
the government newspaper izvestia reported many returned home 
after the situation quieted down 
it said the native kazakhs complained to the leadership about 
bad social conditions of life in the city and high prices for 
essential goods 
they demanded that people from the caucasus region be forced to 
move and that gas and oil production plants stop bringing in workers 
for work shifts of a week or longer according to izvesti it said 
the protesters claimed the imported workers live better than the 
local population 
the protesters were particularly angry at cooperatives owned by 
the caucasus minorities mikhailov said cooperatives are small 
privately owned businesses that have been permitted under president 
mikhail s gorbachevs reforms as an alternative to the staterun 
economy 
many soviets suspect cooperative owners of profiteering and 
serving as fronts for organized crime

residents of this arid county in western 
utah home to military installations industrial plants and waste 
disposal facilities are no strangers to pollution hazards 
and now state officials have been told that amax magnesium 
corp which extracts metal from evaporation ponds on the western 
shore of the great salt lake is the nations single greatest source 
of toxic air pollutants specifically chlorine according to the 
natural resources defense council 
certainly were not proud of the designation amax spokesman 
lee brown said tuesday but the fact is weve been cognizant of 
the emissions and have done environmental studies that show 
absolutely no discernable effects 
brown said the plant about 65 miles from salt lake city and 40 
miles from the nearest community employs about 600 workers who 
extract magnesium chloride salt from the briny water and process 
magnesium and liquid chloride for a variety of industrial uses 
even now the company is installing devices to reduce the 
emission of chlorine gas from the stacks by 50 percent at years end 
and a total of 75 percent by 1991 state environmental health 
officials say 
what concerns some officials more than amaxs emissions is that 
tooele county with its immense deserts and desolate mountains has 
become a favorite destination for lowlevel hazardous wastes from 
producers in and out of the state 
radioactive tailings from an old uranium mill in salt lake county 
are buried there hazardous waste disposal sites are in operation or 
on the drawing boards one waste incinerator is under construction 
and another has been proposed 
at dugway proving ground the army has conducted germ warfare 
defense testing for decades and tooele army depot stores much of 
the nations arsenal of obsolete chemical weapons the air force 
uses hundreds of square miles of the county for bombing runs and jet 
fighter training 
people drive out there and they think of all this wasted 
land said state rep beverly white a 10term democrat but we 
have mountains streams and deserts it isnt just nothing ive 
been saying for years that i hope we dont turn into the dumping 
ground of the world 
alan miller of the utah environmental center in salt lake city 
shares her concerns 
he praised the strict criteria county officials have established 
for siting mitigation and emergency response capabilities when 
approving new hazardous waste and other developments with a 
potential for pollution 
but along with expertise in knowing how to handle manage and 
work with a hazardous management zone comes a feeling of growing 
confidence he said just like with tad theres an attitude of 
we can live with these things is tooele going to be the 
hazardouswaste frontier 
however tooele county commissioner bill pitt says the potential 
perils of hazardous waste and pollution or accidents at dugway or 
tooele army depot must be weighed with the economic benefits to its 
30000 residents 
besides he said all are strictly regulated by a variety of 
local state and federal agencies 
im not trying to downplay the health factors he said but 
we are trying to balance the two health factors and economics

the peace plan rabin said on israel television they still 
believe we can restore the status quo through the use of military 
force only 
israels military intelligence chief maj gen amnon shahak

death of settler frederick steven rosenfeld 48 israel radio

the house ways and means committee approved 
legislation tuesday revising and simplifying most of the nearly 150 
federal tax penalties 
the measure generally would require the internal revenue service 
to be less harsh on a taxpayer who tries to comply with the law but 
fails than on one who makes no effort to comply 
it also aims to reduce chances that a taxpayer will be hit with 
two or more civil penalties for the same shortcoming 
the committee meeting behind closed doors added the provision 
to a package that eventually is expected to include spending cuts 
and revenue increases required to reduce the budget deficit 
rep jj pickle dtexas said that his oversight subcommittee 
heard testimony that the current penalty structure is a confusing 
morass of complex overlapping penalties that are often unduly harsh 
or just plain irrational 
the irs 35 years ago had only 13 penalties to enforce the 
increase authorities say is due in part to congress use of 
penalties to raise revenue the rewriting is based on the notion 
that penalties should be used only to encourage compliance not to 
raise money 
in 1988 the irs assessed 26 million penalties totaling nearly 6 
billion the irs supports overhauling the penalty structure 
present law imposes a 5 percent penalty for underpayment of tax 
the bill would raise that generally to 20 percent 
most of the changes involve penalties on banks and others that 
fail to file reports on interest and dividends and on employers who 
miss the deadline for turning over withheld taxes to the irs 
in most cases the revised penalties would be graduated so that 
the longer the delay in paying or filing the higher the penalty

palestinian terrorists met with 
libyan leader moammar gadhafi to plan an attack at the frankfurt 
airport but an israeli agent warned west german authorities stern 
magazine said tuesday 
the hamburgbased magazine said an agent from mossad the israeli 
intelligence service infiltrated the meeting and his information 
prompted last weeks security alert at the airport 
the security measures are still in force at the airport west 
germanys busiest 
police are conducting a nationwide search for suspects stern 
said 
it reported the terrorists were planning the attack in an attempt 
to gain the release of convicted twa hijacker mohammed ali hamadi 
and two imprisoned members of the syrianbacked popular front for 
the liberation of palestinegeneral command 
stern said the terrorists met with col gadhafi june 10 in 
tripoli the libyan capital 
it made no further mention of gadhafi the story will be carried 
in sterns thursday edition but the magazine sent a summary of the 
article to other news media tuesday 
stern said the israeli agent quoted terrorists at the meeting as 
saying the time is right to free the fighters from prison 
it is time to carry out the great attack the means are in our 
hands we possess a weapon that will drown many in west germany in 
blood and tears 
west german security sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
confirmed that the warning of a possible attack came from mossad 
christian jaletzke a spokesman for the hesse state interior 
ministry that is responsible for security at the frankfurt airport 
said he could neither confirm nor deny that mossad provided the tip 
but he said the information that had been received was considered 
reliable the information was of such quality that we had to 
step up security he said 
when security was strengthened last week authorities said the 
measures were linked to hamadis case 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem was convicted by a frankfurt 
court last month of murder and air piracy in the 1985 twa hijacking 
and was sentenced to life imprisonment a us navy diver was killed 
by the hijackers

wanted to gain the release of two popular front members jailed in 
west germany after a raid in october on suspected terrorist cells in 
the frankfurt and duesseldorf areas 
one of the men hafez kassem dalkamoni is believed to be a 
ranking popular front official 
police found in his car a bomb concealed in a radio cassette 
player that was similar to the device that blew up pan am flight 103 
over scotland in december killing 270 people 
stern said a search of dalkamonis apartment in frankfurt turned 
up evidence of an underground arms cache but it was empty 
it added that police using dogs are searching for explosives in 
wooded areas around the airport 
the reagan administration accused gadhafis regime of supporting 
international terrorism and on april 14 1986 us warplanes 
bombed the libyan cities of tripoli and benghazi gadhafi repeatedly 
has denied he supports terrorist actions

the house member whose subcommittee is crafting 
rural development legislation says he wants to move slowly but 
surely despite the desire in the senate to push such a measure 
through quickly 
were taking a different approach said rep glenn english 
dokla whose subcommittee is holding a lengthy series of hearings 
before crafting legislation early this fall 
were reaching outside washington said english we will 
have heard from over 40 witnesses by the time we finish hearings 
this month 
he also has scheduled hearings in five regions of the country in 
august 
english said the house agriculture subcommittee on conservation 
credit and rural development is moving as quickly as it can but he 
doesnt understand the push it through approach being taken by 
the senate 
sen patrick leahy dvt and chairman of the senate agriculture 
committee was joined by several other democratic senators the 
national association of development organizations and the national 
association of counties at a news conference tuesday promoting his 
bill 
one of the reasons we worked so hard to get this out is so that 
it wont be perceived as a farm bill said leahy ninety percent 
of rural america is not involved in farming 
english said that timing will determine whether the legislation 
is incorporated into the 1990 omnibus bill that sets farm policy for 
several years 
there are some good points about that legislation leahys 
bill and i think it is fine as far as it goes english said i 
dont think legislation drawn up by any one house is going to be the 
best approach to all the problems in rural america 
english said the house might pass a rural development bill by 
this december but his timetable is geared for passage of a law 
before the sessions end in december 1990 
he said he expects a conference committee comprising members of 
both the house and senate to bring the measures together 
legislation to aid rural communities is considered necessary 
because steady loss of job opportunities deteriorating roads 
bridges and other infrastructure and declining education are 
driving people away 
but such legislation is more difficult to pass in the house than 
in the senate because urban districts hold the majority in the 
house 
english has warned that unless something is done to reverse the 
trend cities will be greatly overburdened 
leahy calls his bill landmark legislation that he has waited 
15 years to see passed 
this bill has three basic purposes he said 
it will provide capital for new businesses in the form of 
revolving loans set up satellite educational and health 
communication systems and provide funds for improving drinking water 
leahy claimed he has strong support in the senate now that the 
interests of those seeking drought legislation have been met 
a snag developed last week when sen bob dole rkan threatened 
to block the bill if the agriculture committee didnt pass his 
relief legislation for winter wheat farmers whose crops were 
destroyed by drought 
leahy has scheduled hearings on the drought measure next month 
with both it and his rural development bill to receive floor action 
the same day soon after the july 4 break 
economic development officials from the rural south complained 
however that leahys bill will help rural areas with the worst 
economic problems 
the officials questioned whether the most economically depressed 
rural areas will be able to use the centerpiece of the legislation 
300 million to start or expand revolving loan funds because of 
its requirement that the federal aid be matched by local sources 
most poor areas cant afford those matching funds they said

the senate commerce committee approved 
legislation on tuesday to improve highway safety by toughening 
penalties for drug sales at truck stops and highway rest areas 
the legislation also would prohibit trucking companies from 
hauling hazardous materials and bus companies from carrying 
passengers if they receive an unsatisfactory safety rating from 
the transportation department 
the measure sent to the full senate provides for doubling and 
tripling of existing penalties for crimes involving drug sales at 
truck stops and rest areas it also would establish minimum jail 
sentences one year for first convictions and three years for 
repeat offenders 
the maximum penalties will vary according to the crime a person 
is charged with 
supporters of the measure say they hope to reduce drug use by 
truck drivers they contend that rest areas and truck stops have 
increasingly become markets for drug trafficking 
the bill also would require the transportation department to make 
random inspections of vehicles that are removed from service because 
of safety problems take enforcement actions against companies for 
serious safety violations and establish a regulation to improve 
truck braking performance 
this is a major step to end big truck accidents that tie up 
major highways and claim more than 5000 lives a year and cost the 
public millions of dollars said david f snyder counsel for the 
american insurance association which represents companies providing 
onethird of the insurance to the nations commercial truckers

former us rep pat swindall was found guilty 
tuesday on all nine counts of lying to a federal grand jury about a 
moneylaundering scheme and he faces at least 10 months in prison 
obviously im very disappointed swindall said pledging to 
appeal well be trying this case again and i hope not in 
atlanta 
he insisted publicity kept him from getting a fair trial in 
atlanta where swindall a republican spent two terms representing 
the eastern suburbs before voters denied him reelection in november 
after his indictment 
he had hoped for an acquittal and a 1990 race against sen sam 
nunn dga but swindall 38 faces 10 months to five years in 
prison on each perjury count probation is not an option under 
federal sentencing guidelines which swindall supported in congress 
he also faces fines of up to 250000 on each of the nine felony 
counts 
swindall looked on impassively as the verdict was read his 
wifes hand on his back he will be sentenced aug 25 
he was accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his 
monthlong 1987 negotiations with an undercover internal revenue 
service agent who posed as a drugmoney launderer and with a 
swindall supporter later convicted of money laundering 
in exchange for a promissory note he held swindall was seeking 
850000 from the agent to finish building his suburban home the 
money was to be funneled to swindall through a mortgage company 
created by his friend and political supporter charles lechasney 
the nine counts represented nine subject areas in which swindall 
was accused of making 20 false statements to the grand jury on feb 
2 1988 the jury found 18 of the statements to be deliberate 
willful lies us district judge richard c freeman dismissed a 
10th count earlier 
i could have understood one or two counts but i just dont 
understand this swindall said 
the jury found that he lied when he said he didnt recall being 
told the money included narcotics dollars when he said he never 
agreed to accept the money and when he said a 150000 check he 
received but later returned had nothing to do with the deal 
to me this is among the most important if not the most 
important case weve handled said us attorney robert barr he 
noted that swindall as a congressman not only swore to uphold the 
laws but helped make them 
swindall a lawyer said the trial included at least two very 
reversible errors which he hopes will win him a new trial 
freemans dismissal of the testimony of us rep barney frank 
dmass that house members have an overwhelming workload and a 
prosecutors remark concerning the possible motivation of defendants 
to testify during criminal trials 
swindall did not testify in his own defense 
neither of those two areas however went directly to the bulk of 
the evidence in the case hours of secretly taperecorded 
conversations among swindall lechasney and irs agent michael 
mullaney 
in those tapes heard by the jury swindall was told the money he 
was seeking certainly included drug money and that he would be 
part of an operation to wash cash 
asked what killed swindalls chances for acquittal his lead 
attorney richard hendrix replied i imagine the tapes 
swindall said later that he regrets he ever testified before the 
grand jury absolutely id advise anybody in the future to take 
the fifth he said referring to the constitutional provision 
against selfincrimination 
swindall who had expressed the hope of launching a campaign 
against nunn following the trial said he is now considering a 
number of different career options one of those ive got to put 
into the blend is a prison ministry 
i will go where god sends me god doesnt make mistakes 
the lanky boyishlooking swindall won his house seat in a 1984 
upset in which he campaigned on favorite issues of fundamentalist 
christians against democrat elliott levitas who is jewish swindall 
was defeated last november by democrat ben jones a former tv actor 
in the dukes of hazzard 
in his two terms swindall staunchly voted with the reagan right 
and acquired a reputation as somewhat of a gadfly voting against 
such popular programs as school lunch funding and aid to african 
famine victims

umw have idled about 28000 miners in nine states 
hundreds of the wildcat strikers converged on the southwest 
virginia coalfields and took part tuesday in traffic jams designed 
to slow pittstons coal shipments 
theyve just got the place saturated with people its pretty 
well blocked up said state police lt cf eaton 
hudson said the wildcat strikers realize that if pittston is 
successful in breaking away from a national contract and weakening 
job security and benefits other companies may follow suit 
they see what pittston is doing as a threat to their unions 
hudson said if pittston is successful it will directly affect 
their lives 
hudson jackie stump president of the umws southwest virginia 
district and ca phillips a umw international representative 
were jailed after us district judge glen williams found them 
guilty of contempt of court 
williams said the three violated his order banning sitdown 
demonstrations to block coal trucks at pittstons processing plants 
they were freed by williams after promising during a private 
hearing here tuesday to abide by his order 
the three said they purged themselves of the contempt charge 
because striking miners and supporters told them their leadership 
was needed and their testimony was needed by demonstrators arrested 
in sitdown protests 
this strike is still building hudson told the crowd he told 
reporters the decision to promise to comply with strike restrictions 
in order to get out of jail was not a surrender 
there are no white flags in these hands were going to win 
this strike were not turning back hudson said before holding up 
a bandanna printed in camouflage the symbol of the striking miners 
chuck donnelly an attorney for the umw in west virginia said 
the release of the three should bring an end to the wildcat walkouts 
it sounds like a cause for celebration donnelly said 
but roger caldwell a field representative in the umws district 
17 said the unauthorized strikes probably will continue as miners 
turn attention to the 3 million in fines levied against the umw by 
a circuit court judge in lebanon va 
caldwell was proven correct when about 350 workers at two indiana 
mines ignored a federal judges order to end their wildcat strike 
and 350 united mine workers in missouri refused to go back to work 
and walked out of a meeting with union officials 
the nearly 1700 umw employees walked off their pittston jobs in 
virginia and west virginia on april 5 after working more than 14 
months without a contract the strike spread to pittstons kentucky 
operations monday idling another 200 umw members 
the unauthorized walkouts began last week after a umw rally in 
charleston to protest pittstons failure to sign a nationwide 
contract and to protest the fines and jail terms assessed union 
members in virginia

president bush is even more popular than his 
predecessor but congress is increasingly unpopular according to an 
abcwashington post poll released tuesday 
bushs approval rating after nearly six months in office is 73 
percent positive according to the random telephone survey 
that ties with president reagans alltime high of 73 percent 
positive recorded just after he was wounded in an assassination 
attempt in 1981 
bush has averaged a 72 percent positive rating since he took 
office in january compared with reagans 66 percent approval rating 
during roughly the same period of his presidency according to 
abcwashington post polls 
a total of 54 percent of those polled said bush had been as tough 
as needed in response to the political upheaval in china while 38 
percent said his response had been too weak 
the poll found that those interviewed were disenchanted with 
congress in the wake of the resignation of house speaker jim wright 
over allegations of ethics violations 
congress approval rating fell from 54 percent in may to 37 
percent in june the poll found that is the lowest rating recorded 
for congress in any abcwashington post poll since the question 
began being asked in 1985 the news agencies said in a release 
pollsters interviewed 1546 people 18 and older from june 1519 
the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points

an undercover agent for a state commission 
pretended to be 33 men and cast 33 ballots at 33 voting sites in the 
citywide local school board elections on may 2 the agent testified 
tuesday 
leslie smith an undercover operative for the commission on 
integrity of the public schools detailed for the commission tuesday 
how easy it was to register under dozens of fake names and hop from 
polling place to polling place 
commission chairman james f gill emphasized that there was no 
evidence that fraud outside of smiths had occurred in the 
election 
he also stressed that smith filled out each of his ballots 
improperly so that all his votes were invalidated and did not 
affect any outcome 
we were getting a lot of information from a lot of sources 
indicating that these elections were open to fraud gill said 
we decided to find out if there was that kind of systemic weakness 
and i think weve demonstrated there is 
in the old days if you wanted to engage in this kind of voter 
fraud you had to go to the cemetery and take the names of the most 
recently deceased off of the gravestones and try to vote those 
folks in this situation all that had to be done was sit down and 
draw up a list of fictitious parents and children gill said 
voting for school boards is open to all registered voters and to 
all parents of children in the schools regardless of whether they 
are registered voters 
smith and a commission lawyer made up 84 mens names and gave 
each a fictitious child a parent registration card was filled out 
and mailed to the board of election for each fake name 
seventythree of the 84 names made the voter list of the board of 
election 11 registration cards evidently were lost smith said 
on election day he went to all 35 polling sites within the two 
districts but voted only 33 times because his registration cards 
could not be found at two schools 
under state law the board of education is supposed to weed the 
rolls of ineligible parents and certify legitimate voters to the 
board of election but aaron maslow the board of elections counsel 
said the board of education did little more than give blanket 
certification

andrei sakharov said tuesday the soviet union is at 
a turning point and if the worst happened president mikhail s 
gorbachev could be the victim of a military coup by conservative 
elements 
the soviet human rights activist in a lecture at the royal 
institute of international affairs said the country is at the 
crossroads and faces major reforms from this position the country 
can go either way if it goes too far there could be a fascist 
military coup especially from the right which is the conservative 
element 
he told the audience which included representatives of the 
soviet embassy that the west should be cautious about overtures to 
the soviet union 
western aid could be like pouring water into the sand and might 
prevent necessary reforms he said 
the important thing is not to undertake new initiatives 
sakharov added wait for real change in the political system 
he noted prime minister margaret thatcher is considered a 
supporter of the reformminded soviet president 
the caution she is observing now toward gobachev is 
justified he said it does not contradict her earlier policy 
it is a revision of that policy taking account of existing 
circumstances 
commenting on the soviet union he said i suppose our country 
is now one of the last if not the last world colonial power if 
this problem is not going to be solved in a constitutional rational 
way the destruction or downfall of our country is inevitable 
sakharov accompanied by his wife yelena bonner is on his first 
trip to britain the 1975 nobel peace prize winner received an 
honorary degree at sussex university on monday and is to receive 
another honorary degree from oxford university on wednesday he will 
meet mrs thatcher on friday

congress of the peoples deputies by the soviet academy of sciences 
in april three years after he was freed from internal exile in the 
city of gorky he had been sent there as punishment for his 
dissident activites including criticism of the soviet military

britain braced for transportation chaos wednesday 
when a 24hour national rail strike coincides with bus and subway 
strikes in london 
the court of appeal on tuesday refused a request by british rail 
to block the planned walkout by 75000 workers 
londons 10500 subway workers decided tuesday to go ahead with 
their seventh unofficial 24hour strike this year over pay and 
conditions 
delegates representing 18500 bus workers in the transport and 
general workers union then decided on a lightning 24hour strike to 
demand a 14 percent pay raise 
they rejected an offer of between 8 percent and 9 percent which 
london buses said was roughly in line with inflation now 
running at 83 percent the company said a bus driver operating 
without a conductor earns 340 a week 
the train stoppage will be the first national rail strike since 
1982 when london subway workers also refused to work 
prime minister margaret thatcher condemned the strikers 
its a typically selfish policy to put themselves first before 
those who have to use it deliberately causing massive inconvenience 
to those who have to work she told the house of commons 
british rail which says the strike will cost it 155 million 
had asked the appeal judges to overrule a high court refusal to 
grant an injunction requiring the national union of railwaymen to 
cancel the strike 
the railway said the strike should not be permitted because 200 
union members were not able to participate in the strike vote 
union members voted 29675 to 20704 to strike over british 
rails proposed 7 percent wage increase and plans to abolish 
national wage bargaining 
the court of appeals found no evidence that anyone entitled to 
vote was prevented from doing so 
british rail offered to return to the negotiating table and urged 
staff to ignore the strike call 
we are looking at a pretty well total shutdown said paul 
watkinson the state railroads employee relations director 
the dispute between london underground and 10500 workers on the 
capitals sprawling subway network involves introducing trains 
operated only by drivers drivers want a 99 weekly increase to 
operate without a guard 
management is offering 46 plus 14 days extra annual vacation 
but is tying the raise to increased productivity

south africanled police in namibia have 
created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that threatens fair 
independence elections in the territory a top un official said 
tuesday 
police in armored cars mounted with heavy machine guns apparently 
have driven through villages destroying crops and terrorizing local 
inhabitants according to martti ahtisaari the uns special 
representative in namibia 
a feared counterinsurgency unit called koevoet afrikaans 
for crowbar disbanded months ago is behind the terror campaign 
ahtissari said 
their activities appear to have created an atmosphere of fear 
and intimidation among much of the population in the northern 
region ahtisaari reportedly wrote to namibias south african 
administratorgeneral 
on july 1 campaigning begins for seats in a namibian constituent 
assembly that will draft a constitution and organize the territorys 
first black majorityruled government 
the southwest africa peoples organization is expected to win 
the november elections part of a unmediated peace plan most of 
swapos popular support comes from the ovambo tribe in northern 
namibia 
swapo which fought a 23year bush war against south african rule 
of namibia may not capture the twothirds of the assembly seats 
needed to impose oneparty rule 
many observers believe south africa is funding political parties 
and using the koevoet police to intimidate swapo supporters and stop 
the guerrillas from gaining their majority 
ahtisaari heads a un commission monitoring pretorias 
cooperation with a un plan to free namibia from 74 years of south 
african rule 
he wrote to the south african official louis pienaar on june 9 
nadia younes a un spokeswoman said tuesday he has received no 
reply she said 
the activities in which the koevoet have been engaged render 
its members unfit for continued service in the police in 
view of the need to ensure the necessary conditions for free and 
fair elections ahtissari reportedly wrote

the american medical association agreed tuesday to 
lobby for restrictions on the sale and ownership of assault weapons 
after spirited debate delegates at the amas policymaking 
convention adopted a resolution in support of legislation that would 
affect large clip high rateoffire automatic and semiautomatic 
firearms and any weapon that is modified or redesigned to operate 
in that manner 
the proposal is a weaker version of a resolution debated in 
committee on monday calling for a ban on the sale and private 
ownership of assault weapons and does not specify the restrictions 
being sought 
but it still sparked rousing debate as it was presented to the 
delegates the measure disarms all of the lawabiding 
taxpaying citizens of the united states and leaves us at the 
mercy of the crook the dope peddler said dr f william dowda a 
delegate from georgia 
the national rifle association contends that such legislation 
would unfairly restrict guns commonly used by hunters and that 
criminals would still have access to the weapons 
but dr louis zako of the michigan delegation which submitted 
the original proposal calling for an assault weapon ban denounced 
that position 
a real sportsman who cant bag a deer with a slowfire rifle 
ought to give up he told the delegates 
the measure was among a host of resolutions referred by various 
ama committees to the 433 delegates delegates began voting on the 
measures tuesday and will conclude thursday the final day of the 
amas fiveday convention 
among other action tuesday delegates 
adopted a resolution calling for model state legislation to ban 
the sale of alcoholic beverages at gas station convenience stores 
adopted a resolution calling for federal legislation to restrict 
the advertising and promotion of beer and other alcoholic beverages 
deferred action on a measure that would require food labels to 
list cholesterol content caloric value and the specific source of 
all vegetable oils the delegates called for a detailed report on 
the measure to be submitted by the 1990 annual meeting

president bush ordered new sanctions against 
china on tuesday in retaliation for the governments wave of 
violence and reprisals against the prodemocracy movement 
prodded by congress to take tougher action against beijing the 
white house said the united states will seek to postpone 
consideration of new loans to china by international lending 
institutions such as the world bank and international monetary fund 
one source said bushs order could freeze 14 billion for china 
over the next six months from the world bank and international 
development bank although other estimates ranged much higher a 
house banking committee member said said china had 47 billion 
pending at the world bank alone 
moreover bush ordered us government officials to refrain from 
some highlevel contacts with the beijing government the order does 
not affect routine communications between the united states embassy 
and china but bars anyone of assistant secretary rank and above from 
taking part in exchange programs 
this action is being taken in response to the wave of violence 
and reprisals by the chinese authorities against those who have 
called for democracy white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said in a written statement 
earlier tuesday the administration made a public plea to chinese 
leaders to grant clemency to protesters sentenced to death and to 
pardon people arrested in prodemocracy demonstrations 
the death sentences if carried out could only deepen the 
wounds of the past few weeks fitzwater said he said bush 
directed the state department on monday to deplore the death 
sentences handed down in shanghai and beijing and to appeal for 
clemency in these cases 
in announcing the new sanctions fitzwater said the united states 
supports the legitimate democratic aspirations for freedom of 
peoples throughout the world the us will continue to voice its 
concern and its support for these aspirations 
fitzwater said the united states hopes that the current tragedy 
in china be brought to a peaceful end and that the dialogue will 
replace the atmosphere of suspicion and reprisal 
china is an important state with which we hope to continue 
productive relations he said 
the press spokesman said the situation in china was of 
international concern as witnessed by the variety of voices that 
have spoken up on the issue we urge continued international 
expressions of concern 
even as the new sanctions were announced moves were afoot in 
congress to prod the administration to tough action 
rep john j lafalce dny introduced a resolution in the 
house calling on the president to direct the us directors at the 
world bank and asian development bank to vote against all 
multilateral development loans to china 
the resolution also urged bush to broaden the effort by seeking 
the cooperation of other industrialized democracies at the economic 
summit next month in paris 
this morally bankrupt government does not deserve our 
support lafalce said during a hearing of a house banking 
subcommittee where the resolution was discussed 
in the senate republicans frank murkowski of alaska and gordon 
humphrey of new hampshire criticized us policy toward china as too 
tame 
murkowski said the bush administration was tiptoeing through 
the tulip bed with china while humphrey called the early us 
reaction to suppression pathetically weak 
eleven demonstrators denounced as counterrevolutionaries 
have been sentenced to death three in shanghai and eight in 
beijing more than 1000 other people have been arrested many of 
them students and young workers as a result of prodemocracy 
demonstrations 
we urge the leaders of the peoples republic of china to show 
clemency to use their powers to pardon those who were arrested in 
the demonstration for democracy fitzwater said 
secretary of state james a baker iii told the senate foreign 
relations committee earlier in the afternoon that he had recommended 
to bush the additional measures against china beyond the suspension 
of military sales already announed 
for instance baker said secretary of commerce robert mosbacher 
would cancel a trip to china scheduled for july 10 
congressional del walter fauntroy ddc said at a house 
banking subcommittee hearing prior to bushs action that china has 
47 billion in loans pending or in the pipeline at the world 
bank and 11 billion being processed by the asian development bank 
baker said chinese ambassador han xu had been called to the state 
department monday evening to receive the us request for clemency 
made public by bush on tuesday 
the plea registered by lawmakers as well appeared to fall on 
deaf ears 
chinas ambassador to the united states in a heated meeting with 
members of congress said the turmoil in china was an internal 
matter and that foreign countries should not meddle according to 
participants 
more than a dozen members of congress went to the chinese embassy 
and asked that executions be blocked and that judicial decisions be 
reviewed 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo said they had a 
very frank exchange of views with the ambassador and conveyed 
the outrage and the deep sense of disappointment that exists among 
all the american people about what has transpired in china in the 
last few days 
fitzwater said the united states raised its voice in the spirit 
of a country that has worked with china over the past two decades to 
improve relations but we believe that human rights are universal 
and our duty to comment on them is great 
house speaker thomas s foley dwashington said those who 
have suggested that the president exercise every option and evoke 
every sanction against the chinese government i think are wrong 
these additional sanctions by the president i think will have strong 
support in the congress

a leading republican senator accused fellow gop 
lawmakers and conservatives tuesday of downright deliberate 
deceit in attacks on a major child care package and said the 
republican alternative paled in comparison 
its really irritating to see the misinformation and downright 
false information that has been spread around this body said sen 
orrin hatch rutah 
i get a little tired of seeing partisanship and seeing people 
playing with this issue said hatch the ranking republican on the 
senate labor committee hatch crossed party lines to cosponsor the 
bill which is backed mostly by democrats 
hatch twice took the floor to denounce the tactics of republicans 
and conservative groups singling out the eagle forum for 
distributing shameful information he said misrepresented the 
child care package he supports 
hatchs criticism of fellow conservatives highlighted a day that 
was to be spent debating an alternative child care package to be 
offered by senate republican leader bob dole 
dole had promised to present the alternative tuesday but did not 
do so gop aides said the republican leadership was lobbying 
southern democratic senators in hopes of gaining enough support for 
its proposal to present it on wednesday 
democratic leaders predicted the gop effort would fail 
the majority leader george mitchell dmaine warned senators he 
would delay a senate recess scheduled to begin next week if a final 
vote on child care is delayed past friday were going to stay 
here as long as it takes mitchell said 
the only amendment considered before debate ended for the day was 
approved unanimously on a voice vote it rolled back from 16 to 13 
the maximum age for a child to be eligible for grant money under the 
program 
floor debate resumed after both parties held caucuses during the 
republican meeting hatch said gop senators were given a memo 
attacking the act for better child care sponsored by him and sen 
christopher dodd dconn 
hatch said the memo was full of downright deliberate deceit as 
though thats the way it should be later hatch said the memo was 
not on the letterhead of any senator or group i do not know who 
prepared this piece of junk he said 
hatch did not refer to any of his gop colleagues by name but 
many republicans including dole have sharply criticized the abc 
bill hatch dodd and other democrats have said many of the 
criticisms are not valid because the current bill has been revised 
substantially from dodds original proposal 
i regret that i have to spend time answering charges that dont 
relate to this legislation dodd said weve spent the last two 
days arguing about myths 
as revised the abc bill would authorize 175 billion for child 
care programs in fiscal 1990 with 70 percent of the money going to 
lowincome parents to help them pay for child care the remaining 
funds would go to the states for programs to improve the quality and 
quantity of available child care 
the amended bill leaves regulatory decisions to the states the 
original included federal regulations that faced staunch gop 
opposition 
tacked on to the doddhatch bill were two proposals approved by 
the senate finance committee a new upto500 tax credit to help 
families pay for health insurance for children and a provision 
making refundable the existing dependent care tax credit 
the republican alternative dole planned to offer with the 
blessing of the white house would rely almost entirely on tax 
credits to help parents pay for child care it too would make the 
dependentcare credit refundable and create a new child care tax 
credit for lowincome families with children up to 4 years old the 
dole proposal also would create a 400 million block grant program 
to help states expand child care opportunities

a top republican political consultant 
acknowledged tuesday he used influence peddling to steer 
millions of dollars in government renovation funds to a housing 
project that he owned in part 
paul manafort a onetime adviser to the campaigns of presidents 
bush and reagan and a former business partner of gop national 
committee chairman lee atwater also told a house subcommittee that 
the 326000 fee his lobbying firm charged for helping to obtain the 
government money was the going rate for such services 
the housing project in southern new jersey approved by the 
department of housing and urban development late in the reagan 
administration was denounced as wasteful by democratic and 
republican members of congress and by local officials from the 
7000person township where it is located upper deerfiel 
manafort said his firm was to provide public relations and 
lobbying services for the project when pressed on what those 
services entailed he conceded i would stipulate that for the 
purposes of today you could characterize this as influence 
peddling 
i think it is a horrible waste of taxpayers money said 
bruce t peterson the mayor after learning that with tax credits 
rent subsidies and repair grants the project was costing the federal 
government about 43 million 
peterson said local officials were told nothing about the project 
until well after the developers and their paid consultants started 
going after the federal money 
rep christopher shays rconn later said he believed that the 
project was not worthy of federal funds in the first place 
the housing project is a complex of 326 apartments built in the 
1940s that had become dilapidated over the years 
in april 1987 cfm development corp of which manafort is one of 
three principal owners bought the project for 44 million at 
least 1 million more than township officials said the land and 
buildings were worth 
about a month later the state housing authority ran an 
advertisement announcing the availability of government funds to fix 
up such projects about two weeks later manaforts group the only 
one to apply was awarded 55 million to fix up the buildings 
in his testimony tuesday before the housing and employment 
subcommittee of the government operations committee manafort 
repeatedly said the development company was taking risks because 
there was no guarantee that it would get the money from the 
department of housing and urban development as proof he cited an 
advertisement which ran just once and in just one newspaper 
soliciting applications from developers 
nobody in this world believes that you had any doubt the 
money would come through said rep barney frank dmass 
holding up a copy of the advertisement rep charles schumer 
dny said you could have cut out all this language and written 
one sentence the fix is in 
subcommittee chairman tom lantos dcalif just read the 
advertisement out loud it invited developers to apply for hud funds 
but said the money was only for projects with more than 100 
apartments and must be located in the city of seabrook 
there is no such city in new jersey seabrook is the name of the 
housing project 
this was about as phony an advertisement as you have ever 
seen lantos said this was a sham and an illusion that it was 
publicly advertised 
manafort testified that before the developers bought the property 
his lobbying firm black manafort stone amp kelly had already spent 
months contacting state and federal officials including deborah 
gore dean an assistant to thenhousing and urban development 
secretary samuel pierce 
ms dean is a key figure in investigations of allegations that 
hud money to rehabilitate rundown housing for the poor and elderly 
was handed out to developers who hired highpriced political 
consultants with ties to the republican party or the reagan 
administration 
earlier this month ms dean appeared before the same subcommittee 
but refused to answer any questions on the grounds that to do so 
would violate her constitutional rights against selfincrimination 
manafort is not the only republican who is said to have benefited 
by access to hud during the eight years of the reagan presidency 
former interior secretary james watt former sen edward brooke of 
massachusetts and the late john mitchell attorney general during 
the nixon administration all made thousands of dollars by helping 
others get money from the department 
on tuesday the new york times reported that robert weinberger a 
nephew of reagans defense secretary was a consultant who helped a 
st paul minn housing project get funds

official results tuesday confirmed that 
solidarity clinched 260 of the 261 seats it was allowed to contest 
in the new national assembly guaranteeing the union a veto over 
communist party legislation 
but two days after sundays voting politicians from both sides 
already were turning attention to the election of polands first 
president in 37 years 
results issued by the national electoral commission showed 
solidarity holding 99 of 100 seats in the senate the east blocs 
first democratically elected parliament chamber 
the independent union also gained 161 seats in the lower house 
the sejm compared to 299 seats held by the communistled coalition 
that gave the communist coalition 65 percent of sejm seats and 
solidarity 35 percent the ratio permitted under a preelection 
bargain 
but the communist party had only 173 of the coalition seats 
making it technically a minority minor progovernment catholic 
groups made up the remainder of coalition places 
and among the communist coalitions seats at least 46 were 
progressives endorsed by solidarity several prominent hardline 
communists were defeated 
there is hope that in the new sejm we will find partners who 
understand our causes and who like us favor the process of 
reform solidarity spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said tuesday 
the two sides in the assembly will be roughly balanced so that 
either there will be cooperation between the coalition and the 
opposition or we will face a chain of conflicts that will block the 
legislative process said government spokesman zbyslaw rykowski 
in a next step the national assembly convenes within 30 days to 
choose a president the communist coalition enters the meeting with 
about 40 more votes than the opposition although there could be 
defections 
choosing the president is the last stage of the political bargain 
struck april 5 between the solidarityled opposition and communist 
authorities after two months of talks 
the accord led to the restoration of solidaritys legal status 
after a sevenyear ban and the holding of eastern europes freest 
parliamentary elections since world war ii 
the new president will sign legislation and be commanderinchief 
of the armed forces the president will serve one sixyear term 
poland had five presidents between 1918 when the modern polish 
state was established and 1952 when the office was abolished by 
the communist party 
the president in turn will nominate the next prime minister who 
will form a government 
although communist party leader gen wojciech jaruzelski who now 
leads the country is assumed to be the partys candidate his 
spokesman last week said he still has not decided to run

scientists have discovered air 
pollution over much of africa and it is chemically similar to the 
smog that plagues southern california a research leader said 
tuesday 
meinrat andreae a chemist with west germanys max planck 
institute said the deliberate burning of huge savanna areas 
produces acid rain and ozone pollution that settles over africas 
rain forests 
these levels weve seen over the rain forests are dramatically 
higher than anything anybody has seen over rain forests before 
andreae said in a telephone interview 
andreae headed the west german group in a 20member project that 
included scientists from france and the congo 
he said his team spent two weeks in the field in the congo in 
february and march of 1988 
africas air pollution is a combination of atmospheric 
pollutants which is very similar to the sort of smogtype chemistry 
that you get in southern california andreae said 
when the smoke plume spends some time in the atmosphere and has 
the sunshine burning on top of it you start photochemical reactions 
just like in any old smog situation in southern california 
he said the acidity and ozone levels are similar to those in some 
industrialized areas of north america and europe and he noted such 
levels damage plants lakes and forests 
there is no reason to assume that the equatorial forests 
should be more resistant to these sort of pollutant impacts than 
those in temperate regions andreae added 
he said that while the teams field work was done in the congo 
that country is not a source of the pollutants 
the area affected by the pollution runs from the southern edge 
of the sahara down to south africa he said its a phenomenon 
that essentially covers all of tropical africa 
any country where there are savannas there will be largescale 
burning typically once a year sometimes every two years all the 
savannas are burned periodically for agricultural purposes the 
farmers like to burn the shrub and grass in order to remove the old 
dry grass and get the fresh grass to sprout 
the amount of burning is increasing rather dramatically and 
also the area covered by burns he said there are more people 
the population of all those regions is growing dramatically 
andreae is a director of the max planck institute for chemistry 
in mainz

rep don ritter rpa has introduced 
legislation to block any federal tax deductions from the plan to 
shut the controversial shoreham nuclear power plant in new york 
ritter who quietly introduced the bill last thursday took to 
the house floor tuesday to rally support and seek cosponsors 
ritter objects to the fact that the long island lighting co 
would be able to write off some 28 billion in expenditures if it 
sells the plant to new york state for 1 as planned 
misery loves company but the state of new york doesnt have the 
right to share its misery with the american taxpayer ritter said 
his measure would alter the tax code to deny any deduction for 
unrecovered expenditures on the abandonment of a fully licensed 
nuclear plant 
the bill was referred to the house ways and means committee 
where senior new york democrats such as reps charles rangel and 
thomas downey could be expected to block it 
ritter said he was uncertain how the bill would fare in 
committee but were going to leave some big legislative history 
behind 
under a plan negotiated by gov mario cuomo and teh company 
shoreham would be sold to the state for a symbolic dollar in 
exchange for a series of rate increases shorehams license would be 
transferred to the long island power authority which would contract 
with the new york power authority to decommission the 55 billion 
plant 
the energy department has said it will do everything in its power 
to keep the plant from being decommission deputy secretary henson 
moore last week wrote the new york power authority that it would 
exceed its legal authority if it undertook the decommissioning 
cuomos plan has been approved by everybody involved in new york 
except the company shareholders who vote june 28

a norwegian coast guard ship cut through 
thick arctic ice tuesday and rescued hundreds of people from ice 
floes and lifeboats after their soviet cruise liner hit an iceberg 
and took on water 
some soviet crew members stayed aboard the listing 630foot ocean 
liner maxim gorky to keep it afloat in the norwegian sea 
the rescue ship and helicopters saved passengers huddling in 
blankets in the 37degree temperatures no one was seriously hurt 
about 740 passengers and crew reached the norwegian arctic 
outpost at spitsbergen more than 25 hours after their ordeal began 
officials said passengers were bused immediately to the airport on 
the tiny island of 1000 people for chartered flights back to 
germany 
two soviet planes were to collect the soviet crew on wednesday 
said harald pettersen from the administrators office at spitsbergen 
island 
the maxim gorky was carrying 950 people when it rammed the 
iceberg in the foggy arctic twilight shortly after midnight while 
most of the passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub 
suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me from 
my bed said rudolf ludwig 67 of wiesbaden west germany one of 
the passengers on the midnight sun cruise who was evacuated by 
helicopter to norways svalbard island 
we were told to get into the lifeboats ludwig said we sat 
for five hours among the icebergs the atmosphere was calm and the 
russian sailors did everything they could they gave us vodka and 
whiskey in the boats since it was cold and blankets too 
the iceberg ripped two holes in the ship which quickly took on 
water passengers said three decks became submerged 
the coast guard vessel senja its bow reinforced for icebreaking 
rushed to the area about 300 miles east of northern greenland and 
180 miles west of svalbard island it reached the area about four 
hours later and norwegian officials said all passengers had been 
picked up about three hours later 
soviet ships steamed to the area and took over rescue operations 
the soviet news agency tass said the ship carried 575 passengers 
all but about a dozen from west germany and 377 crew members 
the ship set out on june 11 from bremerhaven west germany 
sailed to iceland and struck the iceberg while sailing around the 
spitsbergen island chain on its way to norway 
the norwegian meteorological institute sends out weekly ice 
charts of the area but the situation changes too quickly to be 
dependable for navigation the norwegian news agency reported 
west german passenger winfried prince said there was no panic 
and the russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking 
passengers into lifeboats and also the norwegians who picked us up 
have done a wonderful job 
about 120 soviet crewmen stayed aboard the maxim gorky to keep it 
from sinking finn b hansen of the north norway rescue coordination 
center said the soviet tugboat sarja arrived with pumps and two more 
russian vessels steamed toward the ship 
it looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to 
keep it afloat hansen said 
a helicopter airlift from the senja carried 73 of the oldest and 
most infirm tourists from the rescue vessel to svalbard island they 
were taken to a church where bjorn sorensen a lutheran minister 
said some were in shock and resting 
arne sinne the rescue center spokesman said the senja battled 
through ice as much as nine feet thick to reach the maxim gorky 
the soviet newspaper izvestia quoted v kornilov of the maritime 
fleet ministry as saying there was fog when the ship hit the iceberg 
only the emergency team will remain on the maxim gorky to fight 
for the life of the ship after they arrive the soviet rescuers 
must determine the character of the damage the possibility of 
eliminating it and make decisions about repair izvestia said 
the cruise ship was built in west germany in 1969 and sold to the 
soviets in 1974

hundreds of northern civil rights workers 
arrived in mississippi on tuesday to relive for one day the 
long hot summer of 1964 
the riders predominantly blacks traveled 30 hours from new york 
city and philadelphia pa they came to take part in memorial 
services commemorating the murders of james chaney andrew goodman 
and michael schwerner on june 21 1964 
this state has a dark history and i wanted to see what 
mississippi is like said viola sulton 76 of philadelphia pa 
an fbi investigation revealed goodman schwerner and chaney were 
killed by members of the ku klux klan and their bodies were buried 
in an earthen dam near philadelphia 40 miles north of here the 
murders occurred while the three volunteers were trying to keep 
alive a voter registration drive in neighboring neshoba county 
where philadelphia is located 
the crime was one of the most sensational events during the civil 
rights movement of the 1960s the killings and subsequent coverup 
by neshoba county officials ignited indignation around the country 
and marked a dramatic and tragic beginning to the socalled 
mississippi freedom summer project which brought young people 
from the north pouring into mississippi 
tuesdays caravan was modeled after those earlier caravans it 
was scheduled to spend the night in meridian and go on to 
philadelphia wednesday for a day of ceremonies marking the 25th 
anniversary of the murders 
philadelphia mayor charles mcclain said his town was ready for 
the visitors which were to include relatives of the victims and the 
governors of mississippi and pennsylvania 
i have to admit our people have mixed emotions about this 
event mcclain said tuesday while attending a meridian luncheon 
for relatives of chaney a native son of mississippi and former 
resident of meridian 
mcclain added he didnt expect any trouble on wednesday but 
acknowledged that not everybody in philadelphia a farming community 
of 7000 residents is happy about the memorial service 
however mississippi secretary of state dick molpus said state 
officials hope to use the event to show the world that many positive 
changes have taken place in mississippi since the bloody summer of 
1964 
we intend to send a message to the nation that the only thing 
burning in mississippi today is a desire for a better life for all 
our people molpus said in an oblique reference to mississippi 
burning a recent controversial movie about the murders 
mcclain meanwhile said he had doubts about mississippi attorney 
general mike moores statement last weekend that he might reopen a 
state investigation of the 1964 murders 
it could be a pretty rocky thing for our community mcclain 
said weve come 25 years and made a lot of progress and a 
reopening of the murder investigation could set us back to ground 
zero 
ben chaney brother of the slain james chaney differed with 
mcclain 
i think it would be good to reopen the case he said tuesday 
an investigation might help bring out some of the terrible things 
that happened in neshoba county back then such as the beatings at 
the mt zion methodist church shortly before the ku klux klan burned 
the church 
wednesdays commemoration ceremonies are set to begin at the 
small predominantly black church on the outskirts of philadelphia 
the church was rebuilt the year after it was burned by the klan 
on the day they were killed schwerner and goodman white 
volunteers from the new york city area went with chaney to neshoba 
county to visit church members and keep alive a fledgling voters 
registration drive in that county they were jailed on a traffic 
charge and later turned over to a kkk mob which killed them and 
buried the bodies 
the state never did bring murder charges in the case but 19 
mississipians most from the meridian and philadelphia areas were 
prosecuted under federal laws for violating the civil rights of the 
three victims 
seven men eventually were convicted and an eighth pleaded guilty 
their prison sentences ranged from three to 10 years prison but the 
most any ever served was six years 
the us house of representitives on tuesday declared wednesday 
to be chaney goodman and schwerner day in honor of the three 
victims the senate passed an identical resolution on june 9

three house subcommittee chairmen warned 
tuesday the fight over logging in the ancient forests of the pacific 
northwest was more than just a regional conflict and they would keep 
a close watch to ensure national interests were protected 
the chairman of the interior subcommittee of the house 
appropriations committee rep sidney yates dill offered an 
amendment to the interior appropriations bill which would have 
forced the forest service to provide for cutting methods in all 
timber sales that would result in minimal fragmentation of 
remaining oldgrowth stands 
the two northwest members of the subcommittee rep norm dicks 
dwash and rep les aucoin dore were caught off guard by 
yates amendment and quickly objected 
yates agreed to withdraw the amendment but said he might offer 
it again when the full committee considers the bill 
my intent was to protect old growth to the greatest extent 
possible yates said this is a national issue 
meanwhile the chairmen of two other subcommittees said during a 
joint hearing that they too were concerned 
although these forests are found primarily in the pacific 
northwest all americans have a stake in them said rep bruce 
vento chairman of the national parks and public lands subcommittee 
of the house interior committee 
rep harold volkmer dmo chairman of the forests family farms 
and energy subcommittee of the house agriculture committee said the 
future of the oldgrowth forests presented tough policy questions 
for lawmakers 
its of tremendous national concern and we need to make 
decisions in the best interests of all our citizens said volkmer 
both ventos and volkmers subcommittee write legislation for the 
forest service an arm of the agriculture department while yates 
panel provides money for the service 
the cathedrallike forests with trees up to 1000 years old 
several hundred feet high and up to eight feet thick have been the 
focal point of an increasingly bitter fight between 
environmentalists and the timber industry 
environmentalists have sought to have the spotted owl protected 
as an endangered or threatened species as part of their campaign to 
halt logging in the oldgrowth forests of the northwest the 
industry has claimed such protection would close vast areas of the 
northwest to logging creating an economic catastrophe

former house majority whip tony coelho 
was throwing money away like crazy to get elected whip leaving 
the democratic congressional campaign committee heavily in debt its 
chairman said tuesday 
us rep beryl anthony of arkansas told the arkansas democrat 
newspaper that he inherited a 14 million debt from coelho a 
former representative from california anthony said he then had to 
borrow more money to fulfill promises coelho had made raising the 
debt to 18 million 
anthony said that was part of the reason he was not going to seek 
a third term as chairman of the committee which he said coelho had 
turned into a political machine to which countless house democrats 
were indebted 
everybody thought tony was the greatest thing since sliced 
bread said anthony also a democrat yet i took over a 
committee burdened with a huge debt purely and simply because tony 
coelho was throwing money away like crazy to get elected whip he 
would give members anything they wanted in return for a commitment 
telephone calls made by the associated press to coelhos virginia 
office were not answered tuesday 
coelho became house majority whip in 1987 he resigned recently 
in the face of a likely ethics inquiry into his financial dealings 
the committees debt is nearly three times its reported 1987 
debt anthony named committee chairman in december 1986 and 
reelected without opposition in january to a second twoyear term 
said he worked until september 1987 to reduce the inherited debt 
i wasnt able to start raising funds for my tenure as chairman 
for nine months he said still i attempted to put things in as 
positive a light as possible 
the debt shot back up last fall anthony said because he had to 
borrow more money late in the election cycle to fulfill promises to 
candidates the committee generates money for distribution to party 
members seeking house seats 
this committee certainly is not in worse shape than it was when 
i took over he said 
anthony also said knowledge of the debt did not hurt him in the 
race to succeed coelho as house majority whip anthony finished 
third with 30 of 261 votes cast 
anthony said he has not talked about the debt in the past because 
there was nothing to be gained at the time by pointing fingers 
but now that coelho is gone there is no reason to keep it a big 
dark secret

paulo cesar ximenes the no 2 official at the finance ministry 
and a longtime bank functionary was expected to replace camoes 
central bank spokesman murilo murca said 
the center of the furor is nahas a 42yearold multimillionaire 
businessman and the no 1 investor in brazils 30 billion stock 
market 
according to the securities commission nahas bounced checks 
worth 31 million to several brokerages for the purchase of stock 
futures 
the commission said nahas had borrowed heavily to invest in 
bluechip stocks taking advantage of a rule that allowed him to pay 
five days later meanwhile he pumped up the stocks price by buying 
large amounts of common stock so the shares he received later were 
worth more it said 
but when banks restricted credit for that type of operation 
nahas checks to several brokerages were returned for lack of funds 
one of the brokerages was capitanea distribuidora 99 percent 
owned by camoes 
capitanea has a large debt with nahas and since hes not 
paying his debts theres a risk the government will have to close 
down the brokerage said paulistano the securities commission 
spokesman 
because he was such a big investor brokerage houses allowed 
him to run up big debts now all the brokerages that dealt with 
nahas are in trouble paulistano said 
he said 29 brokerages were under investigation for irregularities 
this is just the tip of the iceberg he has lots of financial 
obligations that will be difficult to honor paulistano said 
on june 12 the commission declared a oneday stock market 
holiday to prevent panic among investors rio de janeiro stock 
exchange president sergio barcellos sought federal help but the 
government refused to bail out the brokerages or the rio exchange 
on saturday barcellos announced he was taking a leave of absence 
indefinitely from the presidency of the rio exchange 
the justice ministry has barred nahas from leaving the country 
in sao paulo brazils financial center judge joao da rocha 
mattos of the 12th federal court ruled tuesday that najas could not 
be arrested because there was not sufficient evidence to show he was 
responsible for stock manipulation 
in his 11page decision judge mattos added nahas had made it 
clear he would cooperate with law officials and not leave the 
country 
federal district attorney paulo eduardo bueno had requested 
preventive detention of nahas 
nahas a lebanese immigrant whose business interests range from 
mining and farming to real estate and insurance is a common sight 
in brazilian society pages in 1984 he hosted saudi arabian arms 
merchant adnan khashoggi on a visit to brazil when he met with 
thenpresident gen joao figueiredo 
the commodity futures trading commission of the united states 
also has linked nahas with texas billionaires nelson bunker and 
william herbert hunt in their illfated try to corner the worlds 
silver bullion market 
nahas attorney murilo da silva freire said tuesday that one of 
nahas investment companies filed for protection from creditors 
the company selecta comercio e industria sa was one of 
several firms owned by nahas that operated on the stock market and 
was the hardest hit by the crash

mix arthur miller with neil simon and a bit of 
jule styne and youll get the loman family picnic by donald 
margulies 
this odd yet imaginative domestic freeforall which opened 
tuesday at manhattan theater clubs stage ii keeps the audience 
offbalance for most of the evening as the story switches from low 
comedy to high drama to hardsell musical comedy the changes of 
gear could be unsettling but the playwright and director barnet 
kellman manage to keep everything spinning for much of the time 
on the day i was married the world showed every sign of coming 
to an end says the plays 38yearold heroine doris it didnt 
and neither did her marriage to a drab lighting fixture salesman 
named herbie 
instead their lives in a middleclass coney island apartment 
building just went on and on the years were highlighted by the 
arrival of two sons stewie and mitchell the play set in 1965 
turns on stewies bar mitzvah and all the problems and pressures it 
produces 
like willy loman in millers death of a salesman doris 
dreams of a better life and actually believes she has found one with 
herbie and like willy who idolized his successful and adventurous 
uncle charlie doris adores her late and lamented aunt marsha who 
died at age 23 the ghost of uncle charlie hovers over millers 
classic aunt marsha a toughtalking sexy young woman does the 
same in the loman family picnic 
doris and herbie dont really talk margulies dialogue between 
husband and wife is a model of noncommunication they dont say 
whats on their minds until it is too late 
the wife focuses her attention on her sons the older stewie 
played with authentic obnoxiousness by judd trichter and the more 
artistic and sensitive mitchell portrayed with charm and grace by 
michael miceli 
instead of a writing a book report on death of a salesman 
mitchell creates a minimusical comedy he calls it willy and 
it bursts upon the stage late in act 2 after the family has had a 
major blowup over the bar mitzvah 
mitchells music for willy is by david shire composer of 
baby and starting here starting now it has the brassy 
uptempo sound of a styne show a style totally at odds with the 
humdrum happenings on stage but thats the point of margulies 
family tale 
the playwright even adds several alternate endings to the play 
imagining what the characters would like to happen and what really 
does its funny and a bit sad at the same time 
marcia jean kurtz gives a marvelously funny and touching 
performance as the mother doris refuses to give up or grow old 
dressed as the bride of frankenstein she goes trick or treating 
with her sons on halloween and cuts up her wedding dress for a 
costume she keeps repeating i love my life i love my life i 
love my life and you believe her 
larry block one of new yorks most underrated character actors 
excels as herbie hes a superb physical comedian and a master of 
timing watch him as he forces himself to eat the diet tuna plate 
doris prepares each evening for him 
kellman has a difficult job separating the fantasies from real 
life but with the help of the imaginative lighting by debra j 
kletter and his hardy troupe of actors he does just that 
out the living room window looms a nondescript apartment 
building much like the highrises that hem in the loman home in 
millers play designer gw mercier has an eye for detail down to 
the familys hideous mediterranean furniture and shag carpeting that 
covers the tiny stage 
the loman family picnic is an unusual play it echoes miller 
simon and styne but it can stand on its own as an original piece of 
theater

a father and son surrendered tuesday on 
charges of defrauding the defense department by using lowerquality 
scrap metal in engine parts built into thousands of military 
aircraft and tanks 
russell k baker sr 63 and russell k baker jr 40 of the 
tampa area both former presidents and general managers of aerodyne 
investment castings inc were indicted monday also indicted was 
carman eugene alexander 55 a former chief engineer from converse 
ind 
the bakers surrendered in tampa and were released on 100000 
bail alexander was to surrender in indianapolis said assistant 
us attorney andrew grosso no court date was set 
the federal indictment charges them with plotting to defraud the 
government by using less expensive scrap instead of pure metal for 
military aircraft and m1 abrams tank parts then certifying that 
tests showed the parts met specifications for pure alloys 
alexander and baker jr were charged with lying to the army about 
test results for turbine blade parts and trying to hide the fact 
that the blades didnt meet contract specifications 
the government said the two falsely identified failing results on 
lab reports as nonvalid and omitted failed test results on 
certifications to the army 
baker jr also was charged with obstructing justice for allegedly 
approving a report for the department of defense that contained 
false and misleading information 
the blades manufactured during a 7year period are used on more 
than 22000 aircraft including f16 jets as well as helicopters 
and tanks 
there also appears to be danger to personnel which is not being 
adequately addressed by the department of defense rep john 
dingell dmich told abc news i describe the military response 
to this problem as being seriously inadequate callous and probably 
seriously indifferent 
if convicted alexander faces up to 40 years in prison and 15 
million in fines the elder baker faces 20 years and 520000 and 
his son 45 years and 17 million 
the bakers along with another of the elder bakers sons roger 
35 were also indicted in april on 11 counts of fraud conspiracy 
money laundering and theft against aerodyne 
they have pleaded innocent to the charges against the company no 
trial date has been set in that case but is expected sometime in 
july

four people including a fatheranddaughter 
attorney team were arrested tuesday for allegedly bilking desperate 
couples of 500000 in a babyselling scheme that spanned 21 states 
and canada 
the group preyed upon the emotions of these couples and in 
effect engaged in a black market babyselling operation said 
state attorney general robert abrams 
the four were named in 144count indictment alleging they 
arranged illegal adoptions for about 100 couples from around the 
country fifty couples wound up with the infants between 1983 and 
1988 abrams said 
an investigation disclosed that the defendants enticed 
prospective parents into paying extra fees and supposed expenses of 
the birth mothers abrams said 
some prospective parents paid up to 16000 and did not receive a 
child or receive their money back abrams said the couples were 
told the birth mothers had miscarried or changed their minds 
the babies were found primarily through advertisements placed in 
a supermarket checkout counter tabloid and the couples who wanted 
babies were found through word of mouth officials said 
abrams said neither the mothers who gave up their children nor 
the parents who adopted the infants face any charges 
the four were charged with grand larceny conspiracy fraud 
perjury filing false documents and making false statements the 
charges stem from the illegal operation of child haven of 
northeastern pennsylvania a private adoption agency

prison and a 5000 fine or double the amount illegally gained

the former national security council aide faces a possible 
10year term when sentenced friday by us district judge gerhard 
gesell for destroying evidence aiding and abetting the obstruction 
of congress and accepting an illegal gratuity 
letting north go without a prison term would be a statement 
that 15 years after watergate government officials can participate 
in a brazen coverup lie to congress and collect a substantial 
gratuity and still receive only a slap on the wrist prosecutors

the nations private employers now have 
expanded authority to require drug tests of job applicants while 
railroads and airlines have greater power to test those already on 
the job 
the national labor relations board says private employers may 
decide unilaterally to require drug testing of job applicants 
although they still must negotiate with unions if they want to test 
their employees 
the boards decision came monday the same day the supreme court 
ruled in a more narrowly defined case that railroads may require 
tests for workers without first bargaining with unions 
the decisions regarding existing workers appeared at odds but 
they involved two separate labor laws the railway labor act that 
applies only to rail and airline workers and the national labor 
relations act which governs other labor contracts

in the 20 months since the stock market crash of 
october 1987 the american economy and the workers investors 
managers and others who contribute to it have been repeatedly 
terrorized 
no individual will admit to being the terrorist and no culprit 
has been jailed but there has indeed been a reign of terror as one 
threat passes another takes its place always a test never a rest 
the first of the threats flashed across america within minutes of 
the crash america it was said was about to plunge into recession 
not just an ordinary one but something that would make the 1930s 
seem like boom times 
it sounded convincing a trillion dollars or more of value cannot 
disappear without repercussions consumers who make up twothirds 
of the economy will be unable to buy producers without buyers will 
be forced to shut down 
learned journals prepared articles on the amazing similarities 
between 1987 and 1929 popular essays spread and enforced the gloom 
prophets orated from the mountaintops seers claimed to have looked 
into the pit 
time passed and people adjusted to fear they conceded that 
judgment day might be postponed but in the meantime there would be 
terrible times the economy would overheat interest rates would 
rise inflation was on the way 
that threat seemed good for a few months there was enough 
supporting evidence to convince the experts that this time they 
were onto something substantial inflation now they said and then 
the economic crash 
whether it was through the intervention of divine power or the 
federal reserve or because the threat wasnt real to begin with 
the economy escaped the wild inflation that had been foreseen and 
maybe even the crash 
whatever the old fear eroded into a new thesis this economy has 
some guts after all it was said we will have a soft landing the 
economy will parachute back to reality rather than crash in ruins 
it could not be said others when has an economy that has risen 
for so many months with so many aberrations the federal deficit 
and the imbalance of international payments for example come down 
to a soft landing 
soft landings it was said by erudite ecomomic watchers are for 
astronauts not economies space ships are controlled vehicles 
economies are nothing but meteors racing through space under no 
human control whatever 
meanwhile another threat emerged stagflation if by chance the 
economy came down like a feather instead of a rock it wouldnt be 
able to rise again it would stagflate prices would rise but jobs 
and payrolls would shrink 
so accustomed were people to threats that they almost failed to 
observe that one by one the threats were evaporating like steam on a 
dry day a fragile thread of optimism even wove its way through the 
economy the economy it was said is reaccelerating 
reaccelerate when you mean grow again impossible why we 
havent had our great recession yet punishment first and then 
acceleration perhaps but not before 
terrorism in pursuit of goals generally ignores everything 
including the facts but it also seizes opportunity and if the 
reacceleration theory had to be accepted by the terrorists then they 
would make use of it 
they are reminding us now that the economy is cyclical that ups 
are followed by downs and that whenever the economy accelerates it 
is heading for a fall

friends anxious to catch a glimpse of me and who failing that 
peep at me through mirrors in class i have relations aunts and 
uncles who are darlings too a good home no i dont seem to lack 
anything 
but its the same with all my friends just fun and joking 
nothing more we dont seem to be able to get any closer

while hiding from the nazis anne was transformed from a playful 
girl of 13 to an insightful compassionate even spiritual 
15yearold on jan 6 1944 she recalled a dream about a boy from 
school 
i awoke at this point while i could still feel his cheek 
against mine and felt his brown eyes looking deep into my heart so 
deep that here he read how much i loved him and how much i still 
love him tears sprang into my eyes once more and i was very sad 
that i had lost him again 
in another dream she saw her late grandmother and a friend from 
school 
granny appeared as a guardian angel then followed hanneli 
who seems to be a symbol to me of all the sufferings of all my 
girlfriends and all jews when i pray for her i pray for all jews 
and all those in need 
prepared by the netherlands state institute for war 
documentation the book includes essays on the franks before and 
after they went into hiding the events surrounding their capture 
and how the diary reached publication 
the new edition contains three versions of the diary annes 
first and second drafts and the original published work which 
combines the two 
but commemorating her birth was not the only reason for the 
reissue the book also offers a strong rebuttal to accusations made 
over the years that the diary was fake a shameless exploitation 
in the late 1950s rightwing newspapers in austria and norway 
published attacks on the diary insisting the ideas expressed were 
far too sophisticated for a teenage girl in the mid70s a german 
publishing house began distributing pamphlets repeating charges that 
otto frank annes father had written the diary with the help of a 
new york playwright 
upon franks death in 1980 the original manuscripts were turned 
over to the netherlands war documentation institute work on the 
critical edition began the following year one of the books 
editors gerrold van der stroom insisted in a recent interview that 
the diary is indeed authentic 
we asked the dutch forensic laboratory of the ministry of 
justice which does the same work for police to check the paper and 
ink they found that all the paper and all the ink were very common 
for the first half of the 1940s he said 
they also compared the letters before the war postcards etc 
that she had written to her grandmother in switzerland with the 
handwriting in the diaries they found that the same person wrote 
everything 
the franks lived in frankfurt germany until 1933 when they 
emigrated to amsterdam after hitler took power the nazis occupied 
the netherlands in 1940 and began imposing ever harsher antijewish 
laws forcing jews to wear a yellow sixpointed star 
when the ss the nazi military police issued a callup notice to 
frank in july 1942 the family was forced into hiding for more than 
two years the franks and four others were holed up in a secret 
annexe located upstairs from franks warehouse in amsterdam 
they relied on friends notably miep and jan gies to bring them 
food and supplies and prayed that the allied troops would liberate 
their country before the nazis could find them 
police raided the annex on aug 4 1944 and the prisoners were 
sent off to westerbork a jewish transit camp anne and her sister 
margot were later shipped to the notorious death camp auschwitz 
and eventually to bergenbelsen where they contracted typhoid fever 
and perished within days of each other in the winter of 1945 their 
mother died at another camp 
after the arrest miep gies gathered up annes papers and kept 
them under lock and key when frank returned to amsterdam in june 
1945 he headed straight for the gies home and was presented with 
his daughters journals

clouds gather more closely about us and the circle which separates 
us from the approaching danger closes more and more tightly

gilberto campos was alarmed when he 
found his sons sniffing green rocks that kids carried away from the 
municipal dump 
fourteenyearold luis and 18yearold jose lurched and stumbled 
in the unpaved streets occasionally pulling a sock out of a pocket 
and sniffing it the socks held a bright green rocky substance that 
smelled like airplane glue or spray paint when crushed and sniffed 
it gave the same cheap highs 
the rocks surfaced in march and quickly became the drug of choice 
around the vast dump an area where the welloff live in cinderblock 
houses and others make do with cardboard huts young children 
flocked to it according to dozens of worried parents interviewed by 
juarez newspapers 
it makes people stupid and aggressive more aggressive than a 
drunk said the campos whose sons shoved and hit him when he 
confronted them they would lie on the couch and wouldnt get up 
the green rocks proved to be toxic waste dumped by a 
maquiladora one of 275 usowned factories located in juarez 
to take advantage of cheap labor mexican environmental suspect 
maquiladoras improperly dispose of half their hazardous waste that 
would be hundreds of tons a year in juarez alone 
the officials in juarez say they have gotten rid of the green 
rocks and cracked down on toxic wastes at the dump but gangs of 
toughs known as cholos still collect and sell intoxicating 
substances 
campos didnt know any of that in late march when he took some of 
the rocks to a reform school principal she didnt know what they 
were 
about the same time a woman walked into the centro de 
integracion juvenil a drug treatment center for children and told 
psychologist raul bueno that her 10yearold son was sniffing green 
rocks she said that at the dump there were lots of other 
children who used this 
bueno who estimates that about 200 children experimented with 
the substance sent it to the secretariat urban development and 
ecology or sedue the beleaguered equivalent of the us 
environmental protection agency 
sedue identified it as solidified kaltex an industrial solvent 
containing toluene a petroleum derivative that can cause lung 
damage 
a doctor told campos him the kaltex did more than that to his 
sons when they get married they cant have children campos 
said 
infertility is one possible side effect when adolescents use 
inhalants like toluene said dr antonio carrasco of the la fe 
family clinic in south el paso where inhalant abuse is widespread 
if users dont become infertile their children are likely to be 
deformed 
inhalants harm the liver and kidneys and can cause organic brain 
syndrome characterized by loss of coordination irritability 
chronic confusion and nerve injury carrasco said and they can 
destroy tear ducts 
after a while they cant even cry and theyre subject to eye 
infections he said i think inhalant abuse is one of the worst 
and its one of the most available for young kids 
parents reported seeing cholos jumping onto trucks turning off 
avenue of the aztecs onto the dirt road leading to the dump the 
cholos would toss five 10 and 20gallon plastic buckets of waste 
off to sell when sedue officials inspected the dump april 6 they 
found dozens of buckets of kaltex 
campos who kept several chunks of kaltex as souvenirs said a 
piece the size of his foot goes for 10000 pesos about 435 
in late april sedue traced the kaltex to outboard marine de 
mexico which makes parts for johnson and evinrude outboard boat 
engines 
officials at the waukegan wisbased manufacturer referred all 
questions to tim anklam manufacturing engineer in the juarez plant 
anklam said news reports about the solvent residue had been 
greatly exaggerated and that representatives from the factory and 
sedue scoured the dump in late april and found three fivegallon 
plastic buckets that had originated at outboard marine de mexico 
called omex for short 
omex accepts the possibility that the three pails could 
have been dumped by accident at the juarez landfill it was just a 
human error if in fact it is ours a lot of companies use similar 
materials around here said anklam adding that omex is 
cooperating with sedue and acting legally 
mexican law requires hazardous waste from maquiladoras to be 
returned to their place of origin usually the united states us 
law requires companies returning hazardous waste to texas to notify 
the texas water commission which shares information with the epa 
but roger meacham epa spokesman in dallas said tracking waste 
through paperwork is timeconsuming and even if the epa had no 
record of a company returning waste to the united states it 
wouldnt mean much 
if the wastes are from raw materials from mexico they can be 
disposed of in mexico he said or if its recyclable it can be 
recycled in mexico or they can store their waste onsite in mexico 
indefinitely 
rosa manuela salas chief of sedues office in juarez said omex 
is complying with mexican law she referred all other questions to 
carlos james communications chief for sedue james did not return 
numerous calls to his home and office from the associated press 
ms salas told the newspaper diario de juarez that omex was the 
first maquiladora to be caught throwing toxic waste into the juarez 
dump to ensure this doesnt happen again were giving an 
identification number to each business that generates waste to make 
it easier to watch them 
but it is difficult for sedue to keep watch the agency has 10 
inspectors in juarez to monitor 275 maquiladoras and at least 100 
mexicanowned factories faced with a crushing national debt a 
severe housing shortage and a population boom that adds 1 million 
people to the work force a year mexicos government has not been 
able to make environmental protection a high priority 
so far sedues plan doesnt seem to be working luis hernandez 
the dumps foreman said he doesnt know whats in the scores of 
trucks that deposit waste in the landfill daily neither do the 
drivers he said 
but the cholos seem to know they still wait at the corner where 
trucks turn to go to the dump they still jump on and they still 
toss buckets off the speeding trucks for collection later 
luis campos takes part 
there are 10 other kinds of intoxicants there gilberto 
campos said paint adhesive 
he shrugged helplessly lowered his gaze and sighed

stealing home warner home video vhsbeta 8995 rated 
pg13 
 
stealing home with its baseball underpinnings is a sweet 
little tale of comingofage in middleclass america a place with 
proms and summer at the beach 
its good stuff for a family saturday night viewing but you 
might need a bit of parental guidance for the younger set 
mark harmon stars as the wouldbe baseball hero and jodie foster 
as a free spirit who commits suicide she was his baby sitter as a 
child and sometime lover as a young adult 
but there are two major problems with the film 
the first is that fosters character katy chandler never really 
gets a chance to develop we see far too little of her in the movie 
to really understand her motivation and direction or to explain her 
suicide 
the other problem is the overwhelming use of flashbacks the 
whole thing is a flashback with flashbacks inside the flashback 
which really jumbles the timing 
the story unwinds through harmon who daydreams as he sits on a 
minor league bench harmon as billy the charming allamerican kid 
does a neat job of coming back from a neerdowell to cleancut 
baseball player after he returns home to dispose of katys ashes 
the daydream proceeds through the odyssey of growing up and of 
course the greatest of all youthful experiences stealing home 
from third base

torch song trilogy rcacolumbia pictures home video 
vhsbeta 8995 rated r 
 
there are easier things in life says arnold as he sits at 
his dressing table making up to perform as virginia hamm than 
being a drag queen but you see i aint got no choice i cant 
walk in flats 
and throughout torch song trilogy its clear there are 
easier things than living openly as a homosexual who demands the 
love and respect of the people he loves 
but arnold beckoff harvey fierstein persists and his joys and 
sorrows make a funny and moving film adapted from the broadway play 
for which fierstein received acting and writing tony awards 
as arnold searches for domestic happiness first with a bisexual 
teacher brian kerwin who cannot commit then with a young model 
matthew broderick who is only too happy to do so it becomes clear 
his toughest challenge is his mother 
arnold performs at club east 4th a goodnatured club of female 
impersonators who act as surrogate family to one another in preaids 
new york he hopes for a spouse and to adopt a child 
fierstein does not avoid or minimize the pain arnold causes his 
parents or the pain they cause him 
it kills me to think they look at me and wonder what they did 
wrong he says one day to his brother you call this a life i 
call it a sickness his mother anne bancroft screams at one 
point 
arnold is streetwise and vulnerable and fierstein is capable of 
an amazing range of facial expression his performance is moving and 
endearing broderick and bancroft also are excellent directed by

daffy ducks quackbusters warner home video vhsbeta 
1998 
 
adult merrie melodies mavens will be disappointed by daffy 
ducks quackbusters a newly animated featurelength video that 
strings together snippets of old daffy classics with newer material 
meant to be a sendup of ghostbusters 
this formula is already familiar on television as bugs bunny 
christmas or thanksgiving shows or the like 
but the sad result is that you have cartoon classics with their 
sophisticated wit and superior animation and voice characterization 
patched together by fairtomiddling new animation 
the satiric bite that made warner bros cartoons fun for all ages 
is now largely missing daffy ducks quackbusters is ok for the 
kids but for adults there are certainly better video anthologies 
around 
even more sadly what everyone will notice is that daffy just 
doesnt sound like his zany self nor do the other characters like 
porky and bugs the great mel blanc who has been the voice of 
nearly all the warner bros cartoon characters for some 50 years is 
now 80 
unfortunately this 1980s vintage daffy seems like the pug who 
didnt know when to hang up the gloves

flowers in the dirt capitol paul mccartney 
 
paul mccartneys flowers in the dirt contains some of his 
best work in more than 15 years although it falls naggingly short 
of being an unqualified success 
spurred by exmate george harrisons triumphant comeback and his 
own flagging reputation mccartney pulled out all stops to show hes 
no fool over the hill 
the single my brave face cowritten with elvis costello is 
easily mccartneys best tune of the 1980s its a bracing melody 
about the sudden onset of bachelorhood where it quickly becomes 
clear that the narrators joy over newfound freedom is only a 
facade for a sense of loss the tune is yes beatlesque but is odd 
enough to be distinctive 
this one a gentle melody about finding the right time to 
tell someone you love them and we got married are typical of 
mccartneys sweet side this time though theyre not sickly sweet 
the heavily produced rough ride also works well 
mccartney pokes fun at his image with you want her too a 
biting duet with costello thats the antithesis of pauls cloying 
the girl is mine with michael jackson the comparison with 
mccartneys duets with john lennon is also obvious 
costello helps but mccartney seems driven to abandon his insipid 
lyrics for adult themes we got married looks at the institution 
several years removed from the initial excitement while 
distractions shows how other forces impinge on happiness 
thats a good head start for a solid album but then paul makes a 
few strategic errors 
songs such as motor of love and how many people are the 
type of innocuous filler that all but the truly classic albums 
contain but mccartney stretches these songs to stupefying lengths 
more than six minutes for motor turning them into unpleasant 
experiences its a surprising lack of discipline for someone who 
should know better 
paul also spoils dont be careless love by stretching his 
voice to unreasonably high levels 
still this is far richer album than any by mccartney since 
band on the run back in 1973 its good to have him back

keyboard sonatas by domenico scarlatti london andras schiff 
piano 
 
scarlatti was born in one of musics alltime great years 1685 
when bach and handel also joined the world in 1729 the italian 
scarlatti moved to spain and spent the rest of his life working for 
the royal court there it was mainly during those years that he 
wrote his 555 keyboard sonatas 
what an abundance of music imagine you could listen to one a 
day for 18 months or london could issue another 40 cds of scarlatti 
sonatas these mostly onemovement pieces are gems typically what 
makes them so unique are particular transcendant moments a chord 
here a twobar phrase there even a simple grace note 
it is music of color strumming guitars bagpipe drones clicking 
castanets such a quality makes these sonatas particularly apt for 
piano rather than their original harpsichord medium 
andras schiff uses the instrument to add color yet keeps a light 
harpsichord quality that doesnt turn the music into 19th century 
romance 
his technically superb playing is clear but not luminous in the 
more reflective sonatas it becomes even a little bland he does 
better in the livelier selections schiff holds the music up for 
your contemplation rather than drawing you in 
the choice of 15 sonatas is good and generous at 73 minutes 14 
seconds

management software which is used by businesses for storing and 
retrieving electronic records 
the ability to run oracle could help set ncube apart from its 
rivals said michael burwen president of palo alto management group 
ordinarily the architecture of a supercomputer is pointed to 
doing numbercrunching kinds of things rather than the kinds of 
things you need to do for database retrieval burwen said 
he said other supercomputer makers including cray research inc 
are working with oracle on versions of its database software 
capable of running on their machines 
its probably going to be important to ncube theyre one of 
these companies thats had a solution looking for a market burwen 
said 
ncube said first shipments were scheduled for july prices will 
start at 495000 
the company was founded in 1983 and shipped its first computer in 
1985

colgatepalmolive co says it will buy back 410 
million worth of its shares or approximately 2 percent of 
outstanding stock and expand its employee stock ownership plan 
the consumer product companys shares closed up 1 a share at 
5087 in new york stock exchange trading monday 
colgate said monday the moves would increase the value of its 
stock however many companies even those not facing takeover 
threats have been buying their own stock and setting up or 
expanding employee stock plans recently in part because of their 
value as takeover defenses 
with fewer shares on the market a company is less vulnerable to 
a takeover threat furthermore employees who hold stock in a 
company are considered more likely than other shareholders to to 
side with management in a takeover fight

striking pilots were skeptical of the plan 
eastern whose operations were virtually grounded by the walkout 
that started march 4 is flying only 79 flights daily it said 
monday it plans to increase that number to 226 by july 2 and 390 by 
aug 1

billion in assets to pay off debts the plan still must be approved 
by federal bankruptcy court and a committee representing easterns 
major creditors

not have enough newly hired pilots to support even the july 2 level

aug 1 levels but has only 350 
eastern could reach the july 2 level for a few days by mobilizing

sustain that number of flights weber said

27 now to 49 on july 2 and and 70 on aug 1 
before the strike miamibased eastern a subsidiary of texas air

wilkinson sword inc has taken a swipe at 
gillette co in an escalation of their legal wrangle over razor 
blade claims 
gillette accused wilkinson sword in a suit filed last month in 
us district court in manhattan of falsely advertising its new 
ultra glide razor as the smoothest most comfortable shave known 
to man 
on monday wilkinson sword filed legal papers in which it 
defended its advertising asked that the suit be dismissed and 
accused gillette of false advertising for calling its atra plus 
shavers the best a man can get 
wilkinson sword also said gillette was using monopolistic 
practices in suing wilkinson and attempting to intercede with 
the television networks and independent stations to prevent 
wilkinson from running its commercials 
atlantabased wilkinson began running ads on may 22 that compared 
its ultra glide razor with gillettes atra plus the ad has been run 
on several cable tv networks and several local stations

attempt to confuse the issue of gillettes false advertising 
claim 
spokeswoman michele szynal said gillette had filed challenges to 
the wilkinson sword ads with the networks but said that was a normal 
procedure 
wilkinson is a small player in the 750 million wetshave razor

despite its recent loss of influence opec 
will become a more important source of the worlds oil in the 1990s 
its secretary general says 
in a speech to a group of us oil producers subroto said monday 
he thinks the organization of petroleum exporting countries will 
satisfy up to half of the worlds oil demand in the next five years 
up from about 40 percent today 
in opec we see the projected increase in our market share as 
leading to the restoration of the influence which is our due 
subroto said 
conversely he said he expects oil production in nonopec 
countries to fall by about 1 million barrels per day from present 
levels during the first half of the 1990s 
subroto said no major oil discoveries have been made in nonopec 
areas and production could drop even more with accidents due to 
aging production facilities in the north sea 
with about 84 percent of the worlds total reserves our member 
countries are well placed to support the expansion in world oil 
demand projected for the early 1990s he said 
he added that the 13 opec nations are striving for a stable oil 
market and he foresees no drastic price hikes over the next five 
years 
subroto predicted only moderate increases in real oil prices 
over the period but said opecs future market behavior will depend 
on a variety of factors including cooperation from independent oil 
producers 
he made his remarks to the us interstate oil compact 
commission which represents us oil producers the commissions 
semiannual gathering will be held through wednesday 
its chairman is alaska gov steve cowper who gave an overview 
monday of the exxon valdez oil spill in prince william sound and its 
cleanuup efforts 
cowper said the spill pointed out the need for more environmental 
safeguards but warned they would drive up oil production costs

speculation is growing that the courts may be the 
next key arena in the fight for control of media giant time inc 
times stock price fell again monday following the companys 
rejection last week of a 107 billion takeover bid by paramount 
communications inc and its announcement of its own 14 billion 
70ashare tender offer for warner communications inc 
in trading on the new york stock exchange time lost 562 a 
share to close at 15687 it declined 9 a share friday 
warner communications rose 37 cents a share to hit 5962 and 
was the most active nyse issue paramount shares gained 237 a 
share to close at 6050 
either deal would create one of the worlds largest entertainment 
and media concerns ensuring that an american company would be among 
the global communications giants in the 1990s 
time and warner announced in march that they planned to merge in 
a stock swap transaction and amended that deal friday to provide 
that time would offer 70ashare for half of warners 200 million 
shares followed by a merger in which time would pay 70 in cash and 
securities for the rest 
paramount has vowed to press ahead with its efforts to acquire 
time 
securities analysts said they expect paramount to ask the 
chancery court in delaware where all three companies are 
incorporated for a decision on the legality of the time offer for 
warner 
the game isnt over yet said dennis mcalpine a media 
analyst for oppenheimer amp co clearly the court is the next 
issue 
analysts expect paramount will ask the court to determine whether 
time put itself up for sale by agreeing to merge with warner 
initially and whether time directors acted appropriately by agreeing 
to make the cash offer for warner 
time has insisted it has not put itself up for sale and that the 
cash offer for warner represented a revision of its original merger 
plan 
paramount has argued that time has put itself up for sale 
because time stockholders would have only had about a 40 percent 
interest in the merged company under the old plan as a result 
paramount is expected to argue that time should be subject to an 
auction including any paramount bid 
ken noble who follows media stocks for painewebber inc said 
his analysis indicated that stock in the resulting timewarner 
combination would be valued by the market at about 173 a share 
but he said the fact that warner still was trading well below the 
70ashare offered price implies there is still a lot of 
speculation about all three stocks and about what will really 
happen

the biggest is getting bigger with an agreement 
by computer associates international inc to buy troubled cullinet 
software inc for about 320 million in stock 
computer associates is the worlds first independent software 
company to achieve 1 billion in annual revenue while cullinet has 
fallen on hard times and lost money each year since 1986 
the companies announced a definitive merger agreement monday 
subject to shareholder and regulatory approval computer associates 
of garden city ny said it expected to close the deal in august 
analysts said they expect computer associates to follow its 
tradition of slashing jobs at new acquisitions a possibly painful 
prospect for john cullinane the founder chairman and biggest 
stockholder of cullinet which is based in westwood mass 
cullinane is paternal it was clearly not the first choice of 
john cullinane that computer associates be the company that acquired 
it said charles federman a partner of broadview associates an 
investment banking firm in fort lee nj 
computer associates and cullinet compete with each other and with 
international business machines corp in selling software for big 
mainframe computers made by ibm computer associates also sells 
software for smaller computers 
computer associates is headed by charles b wang an aggressive 
executive who has built the company from an alsoran mainly by 
acquisitions and has promised to keep the company growing at 30 
percent a year 
last year his company had revenue of 103 billion more than 
betterknown software makers such as microsoft corp and lotus 
development corp and a profit of 1635 million 
the proposed merger will combine the talents technology and 
resources of our two companies for the benefit of our clients 
employees and shareholders wang said in a statement 
john cullinane founded cullinet in 1968 he retired in september 
1987 but came back in march 1988 as the company continued to falter 
the company said monday it lost 196 million last year on revenue 
of 2029 million 
computer associates acquisitions have included applied data 
research inc for 170 million last year and uccel corp for 800 
million in 1987 
cullinet itself once the worlds biggest independent software 
company began to stumble when ibm targeted the mainframe database 
software business in 1985 
a justice department spokesman said the department would have no 
immediate comment on the proposed transaction 
the possibility that the justice department might block the 
acquisition on antitrust grounds apparently kept some speculators 
from buying cullinet stock federman said the stock sold monday at 
a discount to the value implied by the computer associates offer 
computer associates shares fell 75 cents to close at 1950 
while cullinet rose 75 cents a share to 9 in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading computer associates issued a 2for1 stock 
split friday 
shareholders of cullinet will get half a share of computer 
associates stock for each share of cullinet they own based on 
mondays closing price for computer associates that amounts to 
975 for each of the 33 million cullinet shares outstanding 
the transaction will be accounted for as a taxfree pooling of 
interests 
computer associates approached cullinet about a merger last year 
but was rebuffed earlier this year cullinet hired goldman sachs amp 
co to shop the company around but apparently received no offers 
better than the one from computer associates

with two strikes against it a dissident 
movement within the united auto workers union will try again 
perhaps today to make itself felt at the unions constitutional 
convention 
the new directions movement is proposing a resolution that would 
limit jointness in auto plants the aim is to limit the growing 
practice of union and management joining together on a variety of 
projects inside and outside factories 
its a key issue for the strongest organized dissent in the 1 
million member union in 40 years since the mid1930s when walter 
reuther took the reins of the union 
if the voting on the jointness issue goes the way of other 
new directionsbacked resolutions the movement may strike out at 
the convention however its leader jerry tucker of st louis has 
said there is more grassroots support for the movement than what 
shows up at the convention 
the forces of the administration caucus led by uaw president 
owen bieber have easily put out any fires of dissent on the 
convention floor while hard voting figures are not available 
because tallies are taken by a show of hands new directions hasnt 
received support from more than 20 percent of the 2000 delegates 
attending the convention 
on monday new directions forces were turned back in an attempt 
to require rankandfile elections for the unions top national 
officers including the president secretarytreasurer and vice 
presidents currently those offices are filled through voting by the 
delegates at constitutional conventions bieber is expected to win a 
third threeyear term in balloting wednesday 
backers of the new directions movement said a oneman 
onevote policy would make the unions leadership more accountable 
to the members administration caucus members said nationwide 
campaigning would be too time consuming besides they said the 
system seems to be working now 
but that didnt satisfy dan mallett of local 31 in fairfax kan 
they pay their union dues they deserve the right to vote he 
said from the floor during debate on the issue 
but jim mcneil of local 600 in dearborn mich reading from the 
conventions constitution committee report said a referendum is 
only the outer shell of democracy the convention system delivers 
the substance 
the effort was defeated on a showofhands vote 
on sunday the first day of the weeklong convention delegates 
turned aside another new directions move challenging the seating of 
several local delegations from regions covering eight southcentral 
states and parts of metropolitan detroit 
also monday delegates heard a campaignstyle speech by us rep 
richard gephardt an unsuccessful candidate for the 1988 democratic 
presidential nomination gephardt in his first major speech since 
being elected majority leader of the house of representatives two 
weeks ago sounded themes similar to ones he and others raised 
during last years campaign 
as he did during the campaign he focused on the nations trade 
deficit saying the bush administration has made some good sounds 
on trade 
it remains to be seen if they are tough he added if not 
were going to have the gephardt amendment or something like it 
the congressman from missouri based a large part of his 
unsuccessful presidential campaign last year on trade issues the 
legislation he proposed would have forced the president to take 
action against countries that traded unfairly with the united states 
you cannot compete against unfair competition he said 
gephardt also criticized the bush administration saying the 
nation needed to develop a comprehensive energy policy and to divert 
spending from military hardware to education and the fight against 
drugs 
this is our time to make america great and good and strong 
again he said

the nations largest maker of disposable 
diapers said today it will begin searching for ways to transform 
billions of dirty didies from an ecological problem into recycled 
flower pots building insulation and lush highway medians 
procter amp gamble co announced it is backing research to see if 
dirty disposable diapers can be cleaned and their components 
recycled the cost of the program was not immediately available 
in a statement issued prior to todays scheduled news conference 
at washingtons national press club bob greene pampgs associate 
director of research said the company hoped to find ways of 
handling disposable diapers and other materials in municipal solid 
waste in ways that can bypass landfill disposal and recover valuable 
resources 
the research to be done in minnesota wisconsin washington 
florida and other states comes as public concern is growing over 
the 16 billion disposable diapers dumped annually in the nations 
overflowing landfills 
while not the biggest component in the us garbage pile waste 
paper bottles and cans are bigger contributors diapers cannot be 
recycled like other trash 
environmentalists have warned that the plasticcoated disposable 
diapers do not decompose making their contents potential breeding 
grounds for dangerous viruses and bacteria that cause polio 
hepatitis meningitis and other diseases 
as a result lawmakers in nebraska have banned the sale of 
nonbiodegradable diapers by 1993 and legislators in iowa 
washington and oregon have considered similar action 
the pampg announcement detailed three separate projects the first 
in cooperation with seattles solid waste utility and rabanco co of 
seattle will collect used diapers from 1000 households wash and 
sanitize them then separate them into plastic and pulp 
the plastic will be recycled into flower pots garbage bags and 
ersatz lumber used for landscaping the pulp will be made into 
cardboard boxes building insulation and wallboard liner 
our aim is not to get into the diaper recycling business 
project director nancy eddy said rather we want to demonstrate 
that the technology is feasible and encourage entrepreneurs to get 
involved in this business 
in another project with the recycling firm recomp inc of st 
cloud minn diapers will be put through a process that churns 
garbage into a soil used to reclaim salttainted lands along 
highways 
the diaper giant also will finance research at the university of 
wisconsin that over the next five years will bury and exhume 
regular and biodegradable disposable diapers at landfill sites in 
wisconsin florida and the northeast 
this landfill archeology will see if products touted as 
biodegradable actually decompose any faster than the regular 
disposable diapers made by pampg 
the stakes are high pampg owns a majority portion of the 35 
billion disposable diaper industry but that market share is being 
threatened by a growing environmental awareness and aggressive 
marketing by biodegradable diaper manufacturers and cloth diaper 
services

in mixed trading the dollar has been gradually falling 
hamada said adding that most investors no longer are looking for an 
abrupt rise against the yen but this does not mean bullishness 
about the dollar has been totally reversed he said 
now is the adjustment phase after the dollars rapid rise to 
the 151yen level last week said hamada 
the bank of japan reportedly was selling dollars to support the 
yen but the amount was not known the central bank does not comment 
on its foreign exchange activities 
on the stock exchange dealers said the yens surge against the 
dollar reassured japanese investors encouraging stock purchases 
nomura securities analyst masahiro umemori said the market 
rebounded by itself mainly because of recent stability in foreign 
exchange 
its too early to say the strong yen is back but the foreign 
exchanges stability was at least good news for stock trading he 
said noting that the index had fallen more than 1100 points last 
week because of the dollars sharp rise against the yen 
trading however was still inactive due to lingering 
uncertainties over currency movements umemori said 
volume on the first section was estimated at 700 million shares 
up from 450 million the previous day 
among gainers were electricals including sony and sharp as well 
as steel and shipbuilding issuees

the chicago board options exchange says it has 
received approval from the securities and exchange commission to 
trade options on interest rates and will launch the new products on 
friday 
exchange officials say options on interest rates will eliminate 
the inverse pricetorate relationship associated with other 
treasury bond treasury bill and treasury note markets and should 
appeal to individual investors 
for the first time there will be a product based on the level 
of interest rates themselves cboe chairman duke chapman said in a 
news release issued monday 
an option is a right to buy or sell a financial instrument or 
commodity at a specified price by a given date investors can use 
options to hedge their positions in cash markets or to speculate on 
market movements 
the chicago board options exchange is the worlds largest options 
market the exchange said in it will offer options on both 
shortterm and longterm interest rates 
the option on shortterm rates will be based on the yield of the 
most recently auctioned 13week treasury bill the option on 
longterm rates will be based on the average yieldtomaturity of 
the two most recently auctioned 7and 10year treasury notes and 
30year treasury bonds 
unlike other interestrate instruments the price of these 
products is based on a composite that is calculated using 
interestrate yields rather than the prices of bonds or bills 
the prices of other interestrate products move in the opposite 
direction from the products yields but with the new options on 
interest rates prices will move in tandem with interest rates 
the cboe also lists options on 201 widely traded stocks on the 
standard amp poors 100 and 500 stock indexes and on us treasury 
bonds and notes

analysts say los angeles investor alfred 
checchi lined up a tidy deal to acquire the parent of northwest 
airlines for about 4 billion but some believe a hostile bidder 
could mess it up 
its possible but not likely said frederic malek a 
washington dc merchant banker who is part of the group that 
struck a 121ashare takeover deal monday with nwa inc 
the proposed acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and 
checchi faces a sept 18 deadline to complete the transaction if 
the deal collapses nwa said it would pay shareholders 70 cash a 
share in a special dividend under a recapitalization which would 
cost about 21 billion 
kurt rivard an analyst for the brokerage dain bosworth inc of 
minneapolis said the backup plan could thwart a possible hostile 
tender offer for the nations fourthlargest airline company because 
it would add unattractive debt to nwa 
in other recent takeover battles including the bidding war for 
rjr nabisco inc hostile offers were submitted after the company 
announced an end to the bidding 
nabisco was ultimately purchased by the new york takeover firm of 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co which has long been rumored as a 
suitor for nwa kohlberg kravis has declined to comment on its 
intentions involving nwa 
malek said hostile bidding will be deterred because it would take 
a substantially higher offer for nwa to justify the expense of 
reopening the auction which spanned two months and included two 
rounds of bidding 
conceding as much los angeles oil billionaire marvin davis said 
he tentatively supports the deal between nwa and checchis group 
wings holdings inc 
davis who owns 29 percent of nwas common shares is one of 
three known suitors who were outbid by checchi the others were pan 
am corp and northwests 20000member machinists union 
while disappointed by the outcome i am pleased that the nwa 
special committee has elected to sell the company as we urged all 
along said davis who noted he was dropping his tender offer of 
27 billion or 90 a share which set off the bidding process 
pan am issued a statement saying it was disappointed its bid was 
not chosen the ailing carrier said that it wanted its offer to be 
reconsidered if the checchi bid falters and that the nwa 
recapitalization would be worth less to shareholders than the pan am 
bid the airline has not disclosed the value of its offer 
northwest unions welcomed checchis bid 
the international association of machinists said its first choice 
would have been its own recapitalization offer but we believe 
that checchi has a good history of operating and is not just an 
asset stripper said guy cook head of northwests iam contingent 
which represents 21000 mechanics clerks ticket agents and baggage 
handlers 
rich siakel a spokesman for the air line pilots association 
said we like things he talks about like a program for growth to 
strengthen the airline 
nwa said it chose checchis offer because it contained the 
highest price had the fewest contingencies and was the most likely 
to succeed 
i think the likelihood of this deal going through looks rather 
high rivard said its certainly a fair price and it was at the 
high end of the ranges that people were using 
nwa stock soared 650 a share monday to close at 11412 on the 
new york stock exchange 
checchis proposal includes 700 million equity and 335 billion 
to be borrowed from a syndicate of banks led by bankers trust co of 
new york 
checchis equity partners include klm royal dutch airlines 
bankers trust richard c blum and associates a san francisco 
merchant banking and investment firm and elders finance group a 
subsidiary of elders ixl an australian investment company that 
counts a brewery among its holdings 
checchi said he was not concerned about meeting financial fitness 
requirements of the us transportation department transportation 
secretary samuel skinner has said any leveraged buyout of northwest 
will be scrutinized to ensure that the carrier can operate safely in 
the face of large takeover debts 
my feeling was that commercial banks are relatively 
conservative so whatever level of debt they are comfortable with 
everyone should be comfortable with said checchi 41 
significantly checchis plan does not call for the use of 
highyield highrisk junk bonds as do many takeover deals 
northwests unions said they would oppose a takeover involving this 
type of financing 
checchi said his plan calls for substantial growth including 
the purchase of 138 new planes already on order or option by nwa he 
also said he would retain current management and keep northwests 
headquarters in suburban eagan malek said there would be no 
layoffs nor would any northest assets be sold 
william genoese president of the airline division of the 
teamsters union said he would meet with checchis group later this 
week 
they want the company to grow said genoese whose union 
represents about 7000 northwest flight attendants and clerks im 
for anyone that comes in that will make things grow and improve 
labor relations 
checchi said he also would meet with leaders of the 5000member 
northwest pilots union this week the pilots are negotiating a 
contract and have said they will strike if they dont get a deal 
that offers competitive wages and job security

sabena airlines said tuesday klm royal 
dutch airlines and british airways will invest in a new subsidiary 
to expand the belgian carrier and arm it against stiffer competition 
in a more deregulated european air traffic market in the 1990s 
sabena chairman carlos van rafelghem said sabena will have a 60 
percent stake in the new subsidiary called sabena world airlines 
with klm and british airways each owning 20 percent 
the new subsidiary must consolidate sabenas market share and 
help it turn the brussels airport sabenas home base into a 
european hub he said 
van rafelghem said sabena klm and british airways will remain 
independent carriers but he did not exclude further cooperation in 
air services in and out of brussels if such an arrangement is 
entirely compatible with eec competition law 
johan dekker sabenas vice president of operations said the 
participation of the dutch and british air carriers in the new 
subsidiary will run into billions of francs 
he declined to be more specific a billion francs is about 25 
million 
last year sabena increased its fleet and number of flights 
especially in europe began a 10 million expansion program on air 
and ground services throughout europe and also expanded services to 
the far east 
dekker said the injection of dutch and british capital into the 
new subsidiary will allow sabena to implement a quick expansion 
program to face stiffer competition as the european economic 
community moves to dismantle the communitys internal borders as of 
dec 31 1992

fokker the dutch airplane maker 
that is gaining a strong foothold in the competitive north american 
jetliner market is in the final stages of negotiating a contract 
with pan am corp for the purchase of 30 planes a company spokesman 
said tuesday 
the value of the deal which is awaiting approval by pan ams 
board was estimated at 679 million according to industry sources 
here 
the deal involving the sale of up to 30 fuelefficient fokker 
f100 shorthaul jetliners signaled another step in fokkers final 
breakthrough on the american market said spokesman eduard van veen 
after teetering on the brink of bankruptcy because of huge 
research and development costs only 18 months ago fokker now has 
firm orders for 218 f100s as well as 183 options for its f50 
commuter propjet fokker has 98 firm orders and 32 options van veen 
said 
the dutch airplane manufacturer made its biggest deal in the 
united states so far earlier this year when american airlines 
bought 75 f100s and took as many options other us customers are 
usair and braniff airways 
pan am was expected to deploy the new planes in europe for its 
feeder network to london one of the airlines major european hubs 
and for the shuttle services between west berlin and west german 
cities according to van veen 
the latest contract will speed up fokkers search for a second 
assembly line in addition to the one at amsterdams schiphol 
airport which has a capacity of up to 48 planes a year van veen 
said 
although fokker is considering bids to open an assembly line in 
the united states where some commercial jetliner manufacturers are 
suffering from overcapacity the company is believed to be under 
considerable dutch government pressure to concentrate its production 
facilities in the amsterdam area for employment reasons 
a final decision on that issue is expected in three to four 
weeks van veen said

after 18 months of delays lotus development corp 
said today it has begun shipping its release 3 an improved version 
of the bestselling 123 computer software 
jim p manzi the companys 37yearold chairman made the 
announcement at lotus annual meeting in boston 
with the embarrassing delays last year lotus and release 3 had 
become the moral equivalent of the boston red sox in the world 
series manzi said 
we have come through a very tough period and i believe we have 
proved our mettle he said 
a key feature of the new software is the ability to display data 
in three dimensions 
other computer spreadsheets show information along two axes 
allowing for example a store manager who wants to analyze his 
seasonal sales pattern to put products along one axis and time 
periods along the other 
if he has several stores however the manager faces an 
additional headache with release 3 he can cure it by creating a 
third axis representing various stores or geographic regions 
after three years and tens of millions of dollars in development 
costs lotus is betting that 3d software unlike movies will turn 
out to be more than a quick fad not everyone is sure 
i think three dimensionality is a desirable function for a 
certain percentage of the market but what percentage i dont 
know said richard sherlund an analyst for goldman sachs amp co 
in new york not everyone needs it 
lotus founded in 1982 has grown from a handful of employees to 
more than 2600 worldwide on the strength of 123 its original 
product and still the source of nearly twothirds of its sales 
which are projected at more than 500 million this year 
but to keep ahead of competitors like microsoft corp of redmond 
wash and borland international corp of scotts valley calif 
lotus has had to continually upgrade the programs features 
for the topsecret release 3 project which lotus code named 
godiva the firm three years ago assembled a small team of 
engineers that quickly grew to more than 100 people a confident 
manzi announced in april 1987 that release 3 would be out in early 
1988 
but design and management problems about which the company has 
said little intervened 
lotus said in february 1988 that release 3 would not be ready 
until late in the second quarter of 1988 a month later the target 
date was pushed back to the fourth quarter then last october the 
company announced a further delay until the second quarter of 1989 
with its repeated failure to meet its own deadlines lotus 
earnings and stock price plunged and its competitors picked up 
market share 
manzi a former management consultant who had taken over from 
lotus founder mitch kapor in 1986 was stung by intensely personal 
negative publicity charles digate the executive in charge of 
spreadsheets resigned 
industry wags said the company was pioneering a new class of 
products called vaporware software that disappears every time 
it is about to be introduced 
but lotus apparently turned the corner last year when it brought 
in w frank king a former ibm manager to head up the project he 
injected discipline into the project team and got release 3 into 
field test in february 
as a result lotus stock has largely recovered trading recently 
at around 26 a share close to its 52week high of 2675 and far 
above its low for the year of 1475 
competitors are still close on the firms heels with microsoft 
steadily enhancing its excel software the no 2 spreadsheet on the 
market and borland reportedly working on a 3d version of its 
quattro program 
at lotus annual meeting today in the berklee performance center 
attended by more than 400 people the company showed a widescreen 
television transmission from its manufacturing center in cambridge 
with boxes of release 3 rolling off an assembly line and being 
packed for shipment to customers across the country 
the delays have cost them a lot of clout in the market and 
tarnished their reputation sherlund said in advance of the 
announcement now its their time to shine

other florida attractions to help retire the huge debt it incurred 
in fighting off a 1987 hostile takeover attempt 
the sale of the sea world marine parks in florida texas ohio 
and california and boardwalk amp baseball and cypress gardens in 
central florida is the only way hbj can substantially reduce the 
companys obligations and make the necessary investments in its 
publishing and insurance divisions a company statement said 
in midmorning trading on the new york stock exchange harcourt 
rose 3 a share to 1312 after the disclosure 
the decision came about after recent talks between hbjs 
chairman william jovanovich and its new president ralph d caulo 
according to the announcement 
the statement said caulo is prepared to leave hbj in order to 
manage these businesses under new ownership 
the brief announcement made no mention of a possible buyer for 
the six parks and a tract of land next to orlando international 
airport 
the hbj directors have authorized this sale which is subject 
to the approval of hbjs lenders the statement said mr 
jovanovich and mr caulo have agreed that mr caulo will direct the 
sale of these assets whether made to a corporation or to a 
syndicate of investors 
there was no further comment from the company jovanovich was 
unreachable for comment and caulo did not immediately return 
telephone calls to his office 
hbj a fortune 500 company and the nations largest textbook 
publisher fought a hostile takeover by british publisher robert 
maxwell in 1987 by adopting a costly defense known as a 
recapitalization 
it financed the plan by borrowing from banks and selling 
socalled junk bonds ballooning its debt to 29 billion 
hbj lost 1265 million or 204 a share last year compared 
with a 1987 profit of 644 million or 134 a share the loss came 
despite increased sales of 17 percent to a record 178 billion 
over 1987 
the improved sales were caused by strong demand for hbjs 
textbooks and insurance policies plus the opening of its new sea 
world theme park near san antonio tex according to analysts 
during its first quarter hbj reported largerthanusual losses 
in its publishing division it lost 462 million in the first three 
months of the year or nearly 19 million more than in the same 
period a year earlier 
the company recently underwent a reshuffling of that division 
relocating sales and marketing personnel and eliminating some 200 
jobs

three union leaders jailed for encouraging 
strikers to block mine entrances were freed today after promising to 
obey a judges restrictions raising hopes for an end to a wildcat 
walkout by 27000 miners in nine states 
the united mine workers officials said after leaving the judges 
chambers that they can win their dispute against the pittston coal 
group in spite of the judges ban on tactics such as sitdown 
demonstrations to block coal trucks 
this strike is still building said strike coordinator marty 
hudson as a cheering crowd of about 35 striking miners and family 
members waited outside the court of us district judge glen 
williams he and his two colleagues had been released from a roanoke 
jail monday night pending todays hearing 
there are no white flags on these hands were going to win 
this strike were not turning back hudson said 
hudson said he and the other jailed leaders decided to purge 
themselves of a contempt charge and promised to obey the order 
because striking miners told them they were needed on picket lines 
he also said the three were needed to testify for umw supporters who 
were arrested in sitdown demonstrations 
also released were jackie stump president of umws southwest 
virginia district and ca phillips a umw international 
representative 
the judges june 5 decision to jail the three without bond until 
they promised to end civil disobedience against pittston has been a 
rallying point for wildcat sympathy strikes by some 27000 umw 
members in nine states 
roger caldwell a umw field representative in west virginia said 
the unauthorized strikes probably will continue as miners turn their 
attention to the 3 million in fines levied against the umw by a 
virginia state judge 
what good is it to have them out of jail if theyre going break 
the union anyway caldwell asked 
the three leaders will be kept away from picket sites and instead 
be used at meetings in other communities said cecil roberts umw 
vice president 
we are interested in satisfying him the judge that these 
people will obey his order roberts said 
williams held the three on contempt of court for violating his 
order restricting strike activity the sitdown demonstrations in 
which more than 2000 striking miners and supporters have been 
arrested have since ended 
hours before the three were released from jail the wildcat 
strike ended in virginia when 790 umw employees returned to their 
jobs but 5000 more miners in alabama illinois missouri and ohio 
joined the walkout 
that brought to more than 27000 the number of miners on strike 
against coal operators in nine states not including the 1800 
picketing pittston in a contract dispute the umw has about 80000 
active members nationwide 
bobby r brown president of consolidation coal co in 
pittsburgh joined other coal company officials in criticizing the 
wildcatters i do not know what the issues are except sympathy 
he said i think its a very serious mistake by the umw 
brown also said he feared the union members actions would hurt 
exports 
i think now were going to have to live through being a not 
very stable supplier because of the wildcat strikes he said 
about 1600 umw employees walked off their pittston jobs in 
virginia and west virginia on april 5 after working more than 14 
months without a contract the strike spread to pittstons kentucky 
operations monday idling 200 more umw members 
pittston has refused to sign a nationwide contract and wants its 
own pact that would include mandatory overtime sunday work and a 
cut in pension benefits the umw insists that the company sign a 
contract requiring pittston to pay into the national pension fund 
and keep mines closed on sundays 
the wildcat strikers on monday numbered 16000 in west virginia 
3900 in alabama 2500 in pennsylvania 1750 in indiana 1270 in 
kentucky 1100 in ohio 650 in illinois 338 in missouri and 200

international business machines corp scored a 
publicrelations victory tuesday by becoming the first company to 
announce a personal computer containing the nextgeneration 
microchip from intel corp 
the computer will not be entirely new and it will not be 
available until the end of the year but analysts saw it as a 
psychological victory for ibm which has been upstaged repeatedly by 
rival compaq computer corp 
compaq must really have bugged them they have gotten tired of 
compaq beating them to the market with the latest chip or the 
fastest chip said jonathan seybold publisher of seybold reports 
in malibu calif 
this is a shot across the bow from ibm thats about it said 
richard shaffer editor of computer letter in new york 
ibm said it will sell a 3995 circuit board containing intels 
new i486 chip the board will replace the microprocessor in one of 
ibms personal system2 model 70a21 computers making it run twice 
as fast as the fastest personal computers available today ibm said 
the circuit board will go on sale as soon as the chips are 
available from intel which is expected to be the final quarter of 
this year the price of the computer they go into was cut to 8995 
from 11295 
compaq said the announcement is unimportant because the computer 
the new chip will go into the model 70a21 lacks the memory 
capacity and room for addon equipment that compaqs own 
highpowered models have 
the limitations mean the computer cannot take full advantage of 
the new i486 chips power for such jobs as computeraided design and 
engineering 
compaq faulted ibm for announcing the product before it is ready 
it is absolutely possible that compaq will begin delivering a 
computer based on the i486 chip before ibm does michael swavely 
the president of compaq north america said in an interview 
who announces first really doesnt matter a whole lot 
swavely said 
in contrast robert carberry ibms vice president for systems in 
the personal computer organization said i think were very well 
positioned to be the first to deliver a computer based on the i486 
the model 70a21 was selected as the first housing for the i486 
chip because its design allows it to accept different 
microprocessors easily ibm said other members of its ps2 family 
would also be equipped with the new chip over time although the 
upgrade will be more complex 
ever since compaq brought out the first 80386based personal 
computer in 1986 ibm has been trying to catch up in unit shipments 
of those machines which are the most powerful ibmcompatible ones 
currently on the market 
ibm may hit no 1 in the segment in the current apriljune 
quarter david thomas president of ibms national distribution 
division said in an interview tuesday 
analysts said that regardless of the technological significance 
of ibms announcement they admired the competitive zeal ibm was 
displaying 
i think its a very clever idea seybold said 
separately ibm tried to steal some thunder from another rival 
apple computer inc by announcing new products that allow people to 
use their personal computers as editing stations for video and 
sound the hardware makes it possible for people to produce 
multimedia presentations on their desktop ibm said

silver settled 9 cents to 91 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in july at 525 a troy ounce gold was 70 cents to 1 
lower with august at 36960 a troy ounce 
precious metals prices had been on the upswing rising in five of 
the six previous sessions on perceptions that inflation was 
gathering steam precious metals are considered a safe investment in 
times of rising prices 
inflation worries had intensified after sharp increases in most 
commodity futures prices on monday and many preciousmetals traders 
expected the rally to continue tuesday instead most commodity 
prices opened steady or lower 
the dollar began the day on a weak note which supported the 
precious metals early in the session but it turned sharply higher 
by the end of the day and became a major negative influence on the 
metals 
jim steel an analyst with refco inc in new york said 
preciousmetals traders will continue to watch the dollar for 
direction 
if we see continued dollar strength over the summer i think 
the metals will have no other option but to go lower he said 
metals broker jerry rothman of elders futures inc in new york 
said further selling was prompted by the july silver contracts 
inability to push above 539 an ounce the previous days high 
july silver topped out at 538 on its third rally attempt and 
many traders then gave up and sold the market rothman said 
corn and soybean futures prices dropped on the chicago board of 
trade as wetter weather forecasts for the corn belt took the edge 
off drought fears wheat futures also retreated

the july crudeoil contract expired with a 133 loss at 1953 a 
barrel after a volatile trading session that saw the price whipsaw

signified no new supplyanddemand developments and was solely a 
function of the contracts expiration

lower to 4 cents higher with august at 1888 a barrel heating oil 
was 35 cent to 45 cent lower with july at 4569 cents a gallon

crude oil prices plunged more than 1 a barrel in 
thin trading tuesday while other petroleum products ended mixed 
on the new york mercantile exchange the july contract for west 
texas intermediate the benchmark grade of crude oil finished 133 
lower at 1953 a barrel after gaining 91 cents on monday other 
contract months were mixed 
peter beutel an energy analyst with elders futures inc 
attributed the selloff in crude to the fact that the nearmonth 
contract was set to expire on tuesday 
he noted that prices started out sharply higher with the july 
contract up as much as 2130 a barrel but that they plunged later 
in the session as demand fizzled 
there really were no fundamental reasons for the decline 
beutel said 
the drop in crude helped pull down heating oil the july contract 
for wholesale no 2 heating oil slipped 037 cent to 4569 cents a 
gallon after settling 086 cent higher on monday 
among other refined petroleum products unleaded gasoline for

after an 18month delay that drove down its stock 
and depressed its earnings lotus development corp said tuesday it 
has begun shipping an improved version of its bestselling 123 
computer software 
more than 400 stockholders burst into cheers at lotus annual 
meeting as a live video hookup showed boxes of the longawaited 
spreadsheet program named release 3 rolling off an assembly line 
at the companys cambridge manufacturing center 
with that triumph behind him jim manzi lotus 37yearold 
chairman was able to talk about the embarrassing delays with humor 
lotus and release 3 had become the moral equivalent of the 
boston red sox in the world series he said we have come 
through a very tough period and i believe we have proved our 
mettle 
teresa lotzgesell an analyst with the seattle brokerage house of 
ragen mackenzie said the delay in producing release 3 was a boon to 
competitors like microsoft corp of redmond wash and borland 
international corp of scotts valley calif 
lotus founded in 1982 once had a near lock on the 600 
millionayear market for computer spreadsheets now microsofts 
excel program has about 12 percent of the market borlands quattro 
has between 5 and 10 percent and various other programs have about 
10 percent lotzgesell said 
wih people waiting and waiting and waiting for release 3 
lotus did lose customers she said now they may win some back 
release 3 originally was due out in early 1988 when lotus 
delayed its arrival three times reportedly because of problems 
transferring the basic machine code into the computer language 
c many analysts cut their 1989 earnings projections by 20 
percent or more 
lotus stock also plunged although it has since bounced back to 
about 26 a share from a 52week low of 1475 
now said analyst richard sherlund of goldman sachs amp co in new 
york the question is whether release 3 can recapture the momentum 
for lotus which has 2600 employees and reported sales of 4685 
million last year 
one of the key advantages of release 3 is the ability to display 
data in three dimensions showing a row of up to 256 spreadsheets 
but that ability makes the program something of a memory hog to run 
it efficiently a computer must have the latest generation of intel 
286 or 386 microchips and more than 1 megabyte of random access 
memory 
release 22 a version for less powerful ibm xt and 
pccompatible machines is due out later this year other versions 
including one rich in graphics and one for apple macintosh 
computers also are planned 
manzi who took over from lotus founder mitchell d kapor in 
1986 endured harsh criticism for the companys delays and for his 
compensation which totaled more than 26 million in 1987 but on 
tuesday he was clearly enjoying himself 
thanking the team of more than 100 engineers and programmers who 
produced release 3 he told stockholders that these people have 
shown unbelievable dedication unbelievable skill and an equally 
unbelievable ability to eat cold pizza late at night

a decline in americas young adult population 
will be accompanied by a rise in average household income so the age 
groups buying power will hold steady a research group said tuesday 
the conference board said the pool of young people will shrink 
significantly as the 20th century comes to a close due to a slowdown 
in the birth rate that began in the 1960s 
the number of people between the ages of 20 and 35 will fall by 
about 10 million during the next 15 years from about 63 million in 
1985 forecasts say 
fabian linden executive director of the conference boards 
consumer research center said over the past decade and a half young 
people have been the biggest growth segment of the us consumer 
market 
but in the years ahead they will hold considerably less promise 
for marketers of a wide variety of products and services linden 
said 
he estimated that currently one out of every four dollars of 
total household income flows to homes headed by persons under 35 
years old the amount is expected to fall to less than one dollar 
out of every five by the year 2000 
however the real buying power of this age group isnt expected 
to contract 
the increase in average household earnings over the next decade 
will offset the decline in the number of households linden said 
additionally because there will be fewer available american 
workers between the ages of 20 and 35 they will likely receive 
higher pay 
the conference board is a nonprofit researchoriented group 
supported by businesses trade and professional organizations 
government agencies unions and others

a federal judge tuesday approved an unprecedented 
civil securities fraud settlement between the government and drexel 
burnham lambert inc placing the wall street firm under strict 
supervision and barring it from dealing with its former junk bond 
financier michael milken 
approval of the pact by us district judge milton pollack 
cleared the way for drexel to plead guilty to six felonies and pay a 
record 650 million in order to settle separate criminal charges 
with the justice department 
the civil settlement was reached in april but was held up by 
legal challenges from milkens attorneys that reached the supreme 
court milken alleged pollack had a conflict of interest and should 
have been removed from the case 
in a brief hearing at federal court in lower manhattan pollack 
said that after careful study he granted the joint request by 
drexel and the sec to approve the proposed settlement 
the sec charged drexel last fall with insider trading and other 
securities frauds involving more than 20 takeovers and other 
investment deals between 1984 and 1986 
under its settlement drexel neither admitted nor denied having 
committed the alleged crimes 
the settlement does not include separate civil charges by the sec 
against milken the former head of drexels junk bond division who 
resigned from the firm last week milken also has been indicted on 
criminal fraud and racketeering charges stemming from his activities 
at drexel 
this settlement will bring to a close 2 difficult years for 
drexel its employees and its clients drexel lawyer thomas curnin 
said in court 
curnin said approval of the pact would allow drexel to go 
forward and devote its time and energies to the service of its 
clients 
thomas newkirk the secs chief litigation counsel in the drexel 
case asked pollack to approve the settlement quickly so drexel 
could adopt the settlement provisions designed to protect 
investors and continue to cooperate with the government 
this cooperation is essential not only to the commissions 
ongoing investigations but to investigations being conducted by the 
united states attorney newkirk said 
the settlement requires drexel to overhaul its securities law 
compliance operations top management and some trading departments 
and to submit to three years of close sec scrutiny it does not take 
effect until the criminal plea bargain with the justice department 
is approved 
us district judge kimba wood now is expected to begin 
considering the deal reached in december over the criminal case 
against drexel by the manhattan us atttorneys office 
the sec pact though marks another milestone in the governments 
threeyear investigation of whitecollar corruption on wall street 
that began with former drexel executive dennis levine and led to 
arbitrager ivan boesky who paid 100 million to settle civil 
insider trading charges with the sec in late 1986 
boeskys confessions led the government to drexel which agreed 
to settle partly because of the possibility of a broad racketeering 
indictment that could have put the nations fifthlargest securities 
firm out of business 
approval of the sec pact which was hammered out during three 
months of negotiations was delayed because of challenges by milken 
and his brother lowell a former drexel employee who also faces 
criminal and civil charges 
the milkens argued that pollack should be removed from the case 
because of an alleged conflict of interest in which his wife stood 
to profit from a buyout drexel helped to finance 
drexel fought the assignment of pollack from the time the sec 
brought its sweeping civil case last september pollack refused to 
step down and the 2nd us circuit court of appeals upheld his 
decision 
but the appeals court issued a stay preventing pollack from 
taking any action in the case so that the milkens could ask for a 
supreme court hearing earlier this month the supreme court refused 
to consider the case 
the sec settlement also required drexel to fire milken and bar 
its employees from doing business with him or any clients he is 
advising 
lawyers for milken had been expected to mount a further challenge 
on the basis that the provisions were unconstitutional but with 
milkens resignation from the firm the move was deemed unnecessary 
lawyers said 
milkens attorneys attended tuesdays hearing but made no comment 
milken still is challenging the criminal settlement between 
drexel and the justice department on the grounds it unfairly 
requires drexel to withhold his 1988 compensation of more than 100 
million 
the milkens were named march 29 in a 98count fraud and 
racketeering indictment handed seeking more than 37 billion in 
forfeitures they have pleaded innocent to the charges trial is set 
to begin in march 1990

a government prosecutor charged tuesday that 
officials of princetonnewport partners lp and drexel burnham 
lambert inc illegally bought and sold stocks in a widespread tax 
fraud scheme amounting to plain oldfashioned cheating 
in opening arguments in the first racketeering case ever 
involving securities trading assistant us attorney mark hansen 
said the six defendants engaged in a very simple criminal scheme 
between 1984 and 1986 to generate phony tax losses 
he also said prosecutors would play incriminating tapes in court 
one of which includes a drexel trader telling a princetonnewport 
partner welcome to the world of being a sleaze 
this is a case about cheating hansen said in a packed 
courtroom at us district court in manhattan these defendants 
are wealthy successful men men who decided they were above the 
law who decided they could break the law without being caught 
on trial are five officials of the defunct investment partnership 
and former drexel trader bruce lee newberg the case overlaps the 
governments indictment of former drexel financier michael milken 
neither of the firms is on trial 
hansen alleged that drexel via newberg purchased stocks from 
princetonnewport then sold them back a short time later to create 
bogus losses that princetonnewport declared as tax deductions the 
indictment in the case handed up last august alleged 13 million 
in bogus tax losses 
moving his left hand up and down hansen equated the alleged 
illegal trades with the motion of a yoyo 
these sales were on a string he said when the 
princetonnewport defendants sent those securities out they sent 
them out waiting for the moment when they could bring them back with 
a little tug of the hand 
when princetonnewport defendants went to the government and 
took that tax deduction that was a fraud hansen added 
but theodore wells attorney for princetonnewport managing 
partner james sutton regan said the tax trades were appropriate 
proper and lawful and made in response to changes in federal tax 
laws in june 1984 
each loss involved in this case is a real loss he said 
in another alleged scheme hansen claimed newberg with the help 
of the princetonnewport defendants illegally drove down the stock 
price of comb co in 1985 before a drexel offering of 25 
million in bonds to the minneapolisbased merchandiser hansen did 
not explain the motivation for the alleged scheme 
hansen also told the jury of nine women and three men that the 
alleged bogus stock parking trades also involved merrill lynch 
co and akroyd amp smithers securities those two firms cooperated 
with the government they were not charged 
in an illegal parking deal one party agrees to purchase a 
block of stock under an agreement to sell it back at a prearranged 
time and price usually to skirt federal tax or stock ownership 
disclosure laws 
in addition to newberg and regan on trial are jack z 
rabinowitz charles m zarzecki and paul a berkman all partners in 
the investment firm and steven b smotorick princetonnewports 
comptroller 
hansen said prosecutors would play tapes of conversations between 
newberg and princetonnewport employees discussing the alleged 
illegal deals the tapes made as part of normal princetonnewport 
business activities were seized during a raid on the firms 
headquarters in december 1987 
hansen said one tape contains newberg telling zarzecki after the 
latter made a comb transaction in april 1985 youre a 
sleazebag 
you taught me man zarzecki is said to reply on the tape 
welcome to the world of being a sleaze newberg said 
according to hansen 
much of the evidence in the princetonnewport case also is 
expected to be used against milken the former head of drexels junk 
bond department who was charged in march in a separate 98count 
racketeering indictment newberg also is charged in that case 
the charges against milken include dealings he allegedly had with 
princetonnewport which was based in princeton nj and newport 
beach calif and went out of business shortly after its officials 
were indicted last august 
hansen conceded that none of the defendants made any money in the 
alleged illegal deals but attributed that to accountants errors 
he said that fact did not exonerate the men 
the princetonnewport trial is the first in which the 
racketeering statute which carries heavy sentences fines and 
forfeiture of alleged illicit profits upon conviction has been used 
against officials of a securities firm

tyson foods inc the nations largest 
poultry processor pressed its attempt tuesday to take over holly 
farms corp by raising a tender offer for holly stock to 70 a 
share a bid worth more than 12 billion 
tyson of springdale ark has been trying to take over holly 
farms since last october and the memphisbased holly has been 
struggling since november to merge with conagra inc of omaha neb 
we are delighted that tyson has now decided to raise its bid 
holly farms lawyer kenneth nachbar said in a letter to the delaware 
chancery court that has refereed the tysonhollyconagra squabble 
we do expect the holly farms board to meet within the next five 
business days to consider the proposal nachbar said 
holly urged its 5500 shareholders to hold on to their 181 
million shares until the companys board meets to review the latest 
tyson bid 
in raising its tender offer from 6350 tyson also said its new 
bid was no longer conditioned on removal of an asset sales agreement 
established late last year between holly and conagra 
that agreement is at the heart of a legal fight launched by tyson 
the latest merger proposal for conagra and holly farms was 
announced may 20 and is based on a stock swap while tysons bid is 
for cash 
holly and conagra expect to call shareholder votes next month on 
their proposed merger when the proposal was announced holly said 
it was worth 74 a share based on market prices at the time the 
delaware court has been told however that the offer likely would 
be worth around 68 a share by the time the agreement could be 
settled 
in addition to raising its offer tyson also filed a court 
petition tuesday seeking to force holly to dissolve a shareholder 
rights plan containing a poison pill aimed at making a takeover 
more costly for an aggressor 
vice chancellor maurice hartnett rejected a similar tyson attack 
on that plan june 14 while clearing the way for shareholder votes on 
the proposed merger 
the shareholder rights plan adopted in october would give holly 
stockholders a price break on additional shares in the event of a 
takeover 
the battle for holly farms began last year when tyson offered a 
deal valued at 4950 a share through a cash and stock swap 
holly managers rejected that offer as insufficient and have 
pointed out several times during the ensuing takeover attempt that 
their resistance has raised the amount of money their stockholders 
will make if the company is sold 
conagras original merger offer called for swapping 1875 shares 
of conagra stock for each holly farms share traded the current 
proposal calls for a swap of 21 shares 
tyson foods processes 165 million chickens a week and has 
announced expansion plans to push that to 175 million by the end of 
next month 
holly farms is a diversified company heavily involved in fresh 
chicken sales conagra is a diversified company specializing in food 
and agricultural services

indicted financier michael milken was the highest 
paid wall street professional in 1988 earning more than 180 
million as parttime junk bond chieftain for drexel burnham lambert 
inc according to estimates compiled by financial world magazine 
milkens earnings combined with the 1988 income of the rest of 
wall streets top 10 earners totaled nearly 1 billion exceeding 
the gross national product of some small countries financial world 
said tuesday in releasing its wall street 100 list to be 
published in its july 11 edition 
milken was one of two executives in the top 10 along with 
singer co chairman paul bilzerian indicted or convicted this year 
for securities laws violations

year

harcourt brace jovanovich inc put its four 
sea world parks and two other attractions on the market tuesday to 
help extricate itself from a 25 billion debt brought on by a 1987 
hostile takeover attempt 
the company said selling the marine parks in florida texas ohio 
and california and boardwalk amp baseball and cypress gardens in 
central florida was the best way to meet debt obligations and 
concentrate on its publishing and insurance divisions 
estimates of the value of the properties ranged from 1 billion 
to 25 billion 
wall street applauded the move hbjs stock closed up 375 a 
share tuesday to 1387 in active trading on the new york stock 
exchange 
its a positive development for the company because of its weak 
balance sheet said robert dunlap a securities analyst with brown 
brothers harriman amp co in new york clearly something had to be 
done 
elizabeth bramwell of the new york firm gabelli amp co said hbj 
shouldnt have been doing all these other things the first love 
of this company is publishing 
hbj the nations largest textbook publisher has struggled with 
a 29 billion recapitalization program over the past two years by 
disposing of trademagazine and schoolsupply interests 
streamlining its parks division and reshuffling its publishing 
operations all of which included huge reductions in personnel 
hbj restructured its operations through bank loans and highrisk 
junk bonds to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by british 
publisher robert maxwell in 1987 
the decision to sell the theme parks and real estate holdings 
followed recent talks between hbjs longtime chairman william 
jovanovich and the companys new president ralph d caulo 
according to a threeparagraph statement by hbj 
the hbj directors have authorized this sale which is subject 
to the approval of hbjs lenders the announcement said 
it added that caulo is prepared to leave hbj in order to manage 
these businesses under new ownership 
the parks will be sold as a package to an investor that wants 
to invest in them and continue to see them grow bob evanson head 
of the theme parks division said in an interview 
evanson said the company had spoken to quite a few potential 
buyers of the parks which brought in an estimated 388 million in 
revenue last year and a separate tract of land near orlando 
international airport 
among the possible buyers mentioned by analysts however were 
anheuserbusch cos which owns busch gardens in tampa british 
entertainment magnate robert earl who has restaurant and nightclub 
properties in the area paramount studios which reportedly is 
interested in boardwalk amp baseball and the prosperous walt disney 
co which just opened its third theme park in the orlando area 
hbjs trademagazine and schoolsupply operations were sold to 
edgell communications inc for 334 million in late 1987 that was 
the beginning of the effort to repay some of the debt associated 
with the costly takeover defense 
hbj lost 1265 million last year compared with a 1987 profit of 
644 million or 134 a share 
the company paid about 313 million in interest last year

paramount communications inc pursuing time 
inc with a a 107 billion takeover bid has asked federal 
regulators to set aside rulings allowing time to transfer control of 
its cable tv systems to the company time wants to create by buying 
warner communications inc 
lawyers for warner meanwhile argued that paramounts plans for 
creating a voting trust to take temporary custody of time stock 
violates cable laws that give local authorities the right to approve 
transfers of cable licenses 
the filings at the federal communications commission were the 
latest round in the manueverings over whether paramount can acquire 
time or whether time buys warner in deals that would create the 
worlds largest entertainment and media conglomerate 
lawyers for paramount said in documents filed with the fcc that 
time had misrepresented to time stockholders the nature of the 
transfer of control 
paramount also said time had written to state attorneys general 
asking them to oppose paramounts proposal without notifying 
paramount of the letters 
these actions raise substantial and material questions about 
times character qualifications paramount said in asking the fcc 
to set aside its previous approval of the license transfers pending 
an fcc investigation 
time and warner announced in march they had agreed to merge in a 
stock swap and proceeded to secure appropriate regulatory 
clearances 
paramount launched its hostile bid for time on june 6 just 17 
days before time and warner shareholders were to have voted on the 
merger 
time rejected paramounts offer and revised its merger agreement 
with warner to call for a 14 billion tender offer for warner 
the battle is expected to be waged in court in delaware where 
all three companies are incorporated 
paramount earlier this month asked the fcc for permission to 
deposit any time shares it may acquire in a voting trust that would 
be headed by former defense secretary donald rumsfeld pending fcc 
approval of the transfer of 99 cable television franchises and 
licenses held by times 82percentowned subsidiary american 
television and communications corp 
art harding an attorney for warner in washington said tuesday 
that paramounts request would violate the recent cable act 
because rumsfeld hasnt gotten consent from any of these cities for 
the transfers 
harding echoing assertions time made in a june 13 filing with 
the fcc said paramounts plan would undermine the delicate 
balance established in the 1984 cable act for regulation of cable 
systems by local authorities 
warner asked the fcc late monday to deny the application made by 
paramount for expedited consent for the trust arrangement for 
temporary custody of any time shares that paramount acquires 
warner said paramounts plan called for an unprecedented 
extension to the cable tv industry of fcc rules that cover hostile 
tender offers for broadcast licenses 
such an extension of the fcc tender offer policy would 
emasculate the significant role in cable franchising mandated for 
local authorities by the cable communications policy act of 1984 
warner said 
warner also said among other things that paramounts plan was 
faulty because rumsfeld was being paid 250000 and thus was not an 
independent trustee that a voting trust was invalid because times 
cable systems were affiliated with paramounts madison square garden 
and usa networks and that paramount might end up owning tv and 
cable systems in the same region in violation of federal 
crossownership regulations 
paramounts socalled tender offer is so riddled with 
conditions loopholes and escape hatches as to be essentially 
illusory warner said

federal deposit insurance corp chairman l 
william seidman who would become the new deposit insurance czar 
under legislation moving through congress is talking to the 
treasury department about an idea that would enhance his power over 
the savings and loan bailout 
seidman is angling for greater authority over the resolution 
trust corp a new entity that will be created to close or merge 
insolvent savings and loan institutions and dispose of real estate 
repossessed by the sampls said a wellinformed industry official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
the fdic chairman is said to be proposing that his own 
organizations board rather than a single person be appointed 
chief executive officer of the resolution trust corp 
seidman in a telephone interview tuesday declined to say his 
agency is advocating the idea but he described it as worth 
exploring and feasible 
its not our idea it came from a suggestion that the gao the 
congressional general accounting office made we have been talking 
to treasury about it he said 
the resolution trust corp under legislation that passed the 
house last week and the senate in april will have the mammoth task 
of spending 50 billion in new bailout funds and of handling 300 
billion to 500 billion of bad loans and property 
the legislation does not spell out how the resolution trust corp 
will be structured beyond the composition of its board which will 
be headed by the treasury secretary and the fact that it must hire 
a chief executive officer 
the fdic is getting the job of insuring savings and loan 
deposits in addition to the commercial bank deposits it already 
guarantees however the fdics relationship to the resolution trust 
corp is left unclear 
treasury officials have said they envision the resolution trust 
corp as an oversight agency with fewer than 100 employees which 
would hire others to do its work presumably the fdic because it 
has already taken over the 221 worst sampls and has the largest pool 
of experienced real estate liquidators in the government would be 
the biggest contractor with private firms also getting pieces of 
the work 
however seidman has said he does not want his agency to get 
expanded responsibility without added authority to control the 
conditions and terms under which it does the additional work 
seidman said if the fdic were not given the added authority and 
were simply a contractor of the resolution trust corp it would 
want to pick and choose what sampl liquidation work it wanted 
we can contract to do what we think is good for our agency to 
do and we wouldnt have responsibility for the overall operation we 
would contract to do such jobs as were attractive to both sides 
he said 
however that would probably require the administration to make 
the resolution trust corp a larger and more complex bureaucracy 
than it now wants 
assistant treasury secretary david w mullins said the 
administration has planned all along for the fdic to take the lead 
role in disposing of failed sampls at issue he said is the vigor of 
administration oversight the administration sees the resolution 
trust corps chief executive officer as a fulltime oversight 
officer he said 
no one likes the idea of a fulltime person overseeing them 
but our view is were required to have oversight he said the 
fdic wants as much independence as it can get but theres a 
limit as to what can be done on that 
he said the administration is working to more precisely define 
the rtcfdic relationship in time for a definition to be included in 
sampl legislation which is expected to be on president bushs desk by 
early august following a housesenate conference and final 
congressional approval in july 
joseph e roberts jr who owns an alexandria va real estate 
liquidation firm which has worked for the fdic said there are two 
factions within the agency 
one is composed of fdic veterans who dont appear interested in 
taking on this enormous problem the other faction he said 
consists of the future donald trumps of the world who want to 
expand the agency 
i think seidman is with the young turks the industry 
official said

a retrial of a 13 million lawsuit over a 
jack daniels drink recipe for lynchburg lemonade concluded tuesday 
with a jury verdict in favor of the whiskeymakers parent firm 
former huntsville lounge owner tony mason filed suit claiming 
ownership of the recipe but a madison county circuit court jury 
deliberated just 40 minutes before ruling in favor of brown forman 
distillers corp and against mason 
mason first sued over the lynchburg lemonade recipe in 1983 but 
the first trial ended with the jury awarding him only 1 when the 
judge instructed the panel it could only consider nominal damages 
an appeals court then ruled punitive damages could also be 
considered setting the stage for this months retrial 
jurors quickly left the courtroom after jury foreman roy willis 
reported the verdict around 1030 am tuesday ending a week of 
testimony involving dozens of witnesses and more than 125 items 
submitted as evidence 
mason contended a jack daniels salesman winston randle visited 
his lounge in 1982 and promised him the company might use mason and 
his band in a promotion if it decided to use the recipe 
attorneys for brown forman and randle conceded randle visited 
mason but they said the version of masons recipe that randle 
received at masons nightclub and turned over to company officials 
called for the use of lemon juice instead of the sweetandsour mix 
used in jack daniels whisky promotions 
the company argued that mason didnt have a trade secret on the 
drink recipe anyway because he didnt do much to protect the recipe 
other than inform employees not to tell anyone 
but according to testimony some 25 employees at masons lounge 
including a dishwasher knew the formula 
jack daniels claimed the final recipe for lynchburg lemonade was 
a product of martha bisio lasseter a company mixologist 
mason left the courtroom without comment his attorney jerry 
barksdale gave no indication of a further appeal 
this is something weve worked on for six years and put a lot 
of hours and efforts in i really believed in the case im 
disappointed barksdale said 
a top executive for brown forman the parent company of jack 
daniels which was among the original defendants expressed delight 
at the verdict

a religious group that plans to target one or 
more advertisers for a boycott based on the television shows the 
companies sponsor said tuesday they plan to announce their selection 
july 17 
the group christian leaders for responsible television or 
cleartv said it is analyzing data collected during from the recent

billy melvin executive director of the national association of 
evangelicals and chairman of the group said the data was collected

placement of their commercials by avoiding programs with gratuitous 
sex violence profanity and antichristian stereotyping 
some industry watchers say efforts in the early 1980s to boycott 
advertisers failed but advertisers have in recent months cancelled 
ad plans following complaints from some individuals or groups 
unhappy with the content of programs such as nbcs saturday night

the company initially said it would fight to have the filing 
dismissed but peter a martosella acting president and chief 
executive officer said the petition caused a series of problems 
that forced crazy eddie to seek protection 
the action of the five creditors which we believe was ill 
advised caused a disruption in our bank credit facility and related 
business and cash flow problems requiring the company to seek the 
protection afforded it under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code he 
said in a statement 
martosella said the company had been negotiating an outofcourt 
debt restructuring with its creditors 
we believe that the crazy eddie name remains a strong consumer 
franchise martosella said 
the filing made in us bankruptcy court in manhattan will not 
affect operations at crazy eddies 26 stores in new jersey new 
york connecticut and pennsylvania the company said 
the retailer known for its frenetic broadcast commercials and 
claims that our prices are insane closed 17 of its 43 stores in 
march in a bid to cut its losses 
the company said it had been drained of its working capital by a 
drop in sales compounded by inventory shortages longterm debt and 
unprofitable locations 
in filing to force an involuntary bankruptcy reorganization the 
five creditors claimed crazy eddie was liquidating its assets 
without taking into account its debts they also said negotiations 
on repayment had collapsed 
the petition was filed by the cobra electronics group a division 
of dynasca corp phonemate inc codeaphone corp southwestern 
bell telecommunications inc and northwestern bell phones an 
affiliate of u s west inc

delegates to the united auto workers 
convention turned aside tuesday an attempt to limit joint 
labormanagement programs at auto plants dealing a dissident group 
its third major defeat in as many days 
in a showofhands vote delegates to the unions triennial 
constitutional convention rejected a move that would have forced the 
international union to support locals that oppose the team 
management style 
the socalled jointness resolution is a cornerstone of the 
disagreement between the new directions movement and the uaws 
leadership 
the dissidents claim the joint programs endanger jobs and rob the 
union of its strength the administration caucus which represents 
the unions administration contends that change in the workplace is 
necessary and that new directions supporters dont recognize that 
it makes me wonder where they dissidents have been in the 
last 15 years delegate john nolan of local 1895 in broken arrow 
okla area said during debate on the matter 
but new directions member frank hammer president of local 909 in 
warren mich said the joint programs represent a unionbreaking 
strategy 
i submit to you that jointness is their attempt to coopt our 
union he said 
the joint labormanagement programs grew out of the auto 
industrys slump in the early 1980s and the threat of foreign 
competition 
the new directions effort also suggested that the union abandon 
its seat on the chrysler corp board of directors now held by union 
president owen bieber 
bieber bristled at the suggestion its a lonely place on that 
board but its the only voice of the workers he said 
after the loss jerry tucker of st louis the leader of the new 
directions movement said he thought the debate was worthwhile and 
that he hoped delegates would return to their locals and talk about 
the convention with the rank and file 
the rank and file ultimately will find ways to express 
themselves he said 
tucker declined to say exactly how or when that expression may 
come he did say he expected there would be a new directions 
presence at uaw prebargaining meetings next year the uaws 
contracts with the big three automakers expire on sept 14 1990 
before the debate the third day of the convention got off to a 
loud start as a parade of dissidents marched into the hall waving 
signs and shouting 
it was the first organized demonstration during the convention by 
new directions forces the strongest voice opposing uaw leadership 
in 40 years 
new directions which has about 20 percent of the delegates in 
its corner lost votes on two other major issues it brought to the 
convention 
one involved a credentials fight over certain delegates from uaw 
regions in the southwest and metropolitan detroit the other would 
have required that the union abandon its practice of electing top 
national officers at conventions and substitute for it a national 
referendum of the rank and file

home shopping network lost 400 million 
in profits because its telephone equipment was inadequate to handle 
the volume of calls an attorney said tuesday 
the hefty loss was suffered over a 14month period as the st 
petersburgbased television retail giant went through a huge spurt 
of growth chet kamin a lawyer for hsn told a jury 
gte corp and its subsidiaries knew about the problems that a 
staggering number of calls were not getting through but lied to 
the company and persuaded hsn instead to buy even more equipment to 
try to resolve the dilemma he said 
home shoppings like mothers day every day said kamin 
referring to the high number of calls from viewers who may only 
purchase items while they are being displayed on the screen 
what happened as a result of gte blocking calls and not telling 
us is that we lost millions and millions of calls kamin said in 
opening statements 
a jury of five women and one man was seated tuesday in a 15 
billion battle between the corporate giants hsn and gte corp 
hsn sued gte florida its parent gte corp and other subsidaries 
in 1987 alleging a number of misdeeds linked to what it claimed was 
inadequate service and faulty phone equipment 
gte florida and its parent company a multibilliondollar 
telecommunications firm based in stamford conn have denied any 
wrongdoing and said there was nothing wrong with their equipment 
they filed a countersuit alleging slander and libel and claimed that 
hsn executives engaged in a blame the telephone company scheme to 
mask hsns poor market and financial performance 
gte counsel roy reardon told the jury that hsns charges were 
absolutely baseless 
hsn had 4 million subscribers when it talked to gte about 
telephone service in 1985 reardon said that grew to 9 million by 
august 1986 and one year later the number skyrocketed to 465 
million he said 
sales soared from 11 million in 1985 to 582 million by august 
1987 all with the gte telephone network in place he said 
we dont believe you just cover your own problems of 
mismanagement by blaming other people there was no fraud no 
coverup reardon said 
hsns original 12count complaint has been reduced to four 
charges fraud negligent misrepresentation breach of trust and 
confidence and breach of fiduciary duty 
pinellas circuit judge howard rives combined both suits in what 
is expected to be a sixweek trial 
although there are no phone company records showing the precise 
number of calls in question home shopping expects to show evidence 
that 42 million calls were not completed betweeen february 1986 and 
april 1987 kamin said 
he added that not all lost calls would have translated into sales 
kamin presented what he said was an internal gte memo that noted 
as many as 26000 overflow calls in a onehour period 
the inhouse document asks what are gte subsidiaries 
responsibilities to the customer and the efficiency of his service 
and notes that hsn is not aware that its calls are restricted 
it was in a sense a disaster waiting to happen kamin told 
the sixmember jury and five alternates 
after april 1987 surveys showed hsn was losing 50 percent of its 
calls the company switched carriers to mci communications corp 
kamin said adding the call completion rate now is over 90 percent
