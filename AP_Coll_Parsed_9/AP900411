a car bomb exploded on a busy highway in 
medellin as a police antidrug patrol was passing wednesday 
killing 16 people and wounding at least 73 authorities said 
ten vehicles and surrounding buildings were badly damaged 
officials reported from that northern city home of the notorious 
medellin drug cartel 
no one claimed responsibility but drug traffickers have been 
killing police officers in medellin in retaliation for the 
governments antidrug campaign 
in bogota the news program tv hoy reported late wednesday that 
according to senior police sources the attack was ordered by 
medellin cartel leader pablo escobar the tv program quoted police 
as saying without elaborating that they had irrefutible evidence of 
escobars involvement 
national police declared a state of alert late wednesday a 
communique by the bogota headquarters said more attacks might be 
planned 
eight police and eight civilians were killed in the attack 
wednesday said carlos palacios a spokesman for the government in 
the southern medellin suburb of itagui 
the police officers attacked belonged to an elite unit charged 
with battling terrorism by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas 
the force has received training in colombia from us and british 
security personnel in recent months 
there were conflicting reports of wounded radio reports placed 
the number at 109 while the police spokesman reported 73 the 
police spokesman who refused to identify himself said 60 
civilians and 13 police officers were injured 
palacios said many of the wounded were in critical condition he 
said children were among the victims 
the bomb packing 220 pounds of dynamite targeted a police 
patrol traveling on the highway leading to itagui a medellin 
police spokesman said 
the police revised the amount of dynamite down from their 
initial report of 440 pounds 
the chief of medellins fire department carlos correa said in 
a radio interview by the rcn network that the blast wrecked nine 
other vehicles along with the truck carrying police to their posts 
the attack on a busy highway came as thousands of colombians 
were driving out of the city to begin holy week vacations radio 
reports said the blast left a 7footdeep hole in the highway 
everyone here felt the blast palacios said in a radio 
interview from the itagui municipal government offices near the 
site of the bombing he said the blast caused the earth and 
nearby buildings to shake 
in the port of cartagena president virgilio barco said he was 
sorry to receive such bad news his brief comment was broadcast 
by rcn 
before wednesday gunmen working for the medellin cartel had 
killed 19 police officers and a soldier in less than two weeks in 
medellin colombias second most populous city with 2 million 
residents 
authorities say the drug chiefs have offered to pay 4300 for 
each police officer killed in the city hub of colombias cocaine 
trade 
the cartel claims that members detained by police in medellin 
have been tortured and killed a charge the government denies 
on april 5 police defused a 1650pound dynamite bomb packed in 
a truck and abandoned on a main bogota avenue police blamed the 
medellin cartel for the truck bomb 
the traffickers said in a communique friday that they would step 
up their war against police and the countrys political and 
business elite 
the cartel pledged more bombings and killings in response to 
polices alleged torture and killing of traffickers 
an earlier communique by the cartel threatened more attacks in 
retaliation for government refusal to abandon its policy of 
extraditing drug suspects 
the barco administration has sent 15 drug suspects to the united 
states for trial since intensifying a campaign against traffickers 
in august 
more than 200 people have died in drugrelated violence since 
the government launched the usbacked campaign against cocaine 
cartels the crackdown came after traffickers killed a leading 
presidential candidate 
in december traffickers exploded a 1100pound truck bomb at 
the secret police headquarters in bogota the capital the blast 
killed 63 people 
also wednesday the valle state government reported the bodies 
of 14 people kidnapped in a southwestern town were found in a river 
near obando about 185 miles west of bogota 
the victims had been kidnapped in trujillo 37 miles south of 
obando on march 1 after an attack by a leftist guerrilla group on 
a military patrol 
six soldiers died in the attack by the national liberation army 
the army blamed the rebel group for the kidnappings but 
guerrillas said in a communique that a rightwing death squad was 
responsible 
many of the countrys death squads are financed by drug 
traffickers

the justice department is considering freezing 
assets of savings and loans and sampl officers accused of fraud but 
most of the cases already under investigation wont be affected 
the authority to freeze the funds was included in last years 
sampl bailout bill passed by congress justice spokesman david runkel 
said tuesday it became effective on aug 10 
because the bill is not retroactive however the fraud or other 
wrongdoing must have been committed after that date for assets to 
be frozen runkel said 
thus far no appropriate cases have been found since most 
of the cases being scrutinized by the dallas bank fraud task force 
concern allegations of wrongdoing that go back several years 
the spokesman said 
nevertheless he said a large number of cases remain under 
investigation 
i cant tell you that this is going to lead to substantial 
sums being attached but its a possibility runkel said and 
its something were looking at exploring for possible use 
the freezing of assets would be done before a final court 
judgment is entered on criminal or civil cases and would prevent 
assets from being dissipated as the legal process is carried out 
he said 
we would have them so that they would be available for 
recapture by the government after a verdict he said 
the announcement came about a month after a house subcommittee 
chairman said thousands of sampl fraud investigations were not being 
actively pursued for lack of money 
the sampl legislation enacted in august authorized 75 million for 
pursuing bank and thrift embezzlement this year but the 
administration sought and received only 492 million in actual 
appropriations from congress said rep doug barnard dga 
he said 2327 cases of financial institution fraud and 
embezzlement were inactive meaning they were open but not being 
pursued of those 1298 are considered major cases involving 
losses of 100000 or more barnard told his house government 
operations subcommittee on commerce consumer and monetary affairs 
justice spokesman doug tillett said at the time we are 
putting every penny to work on the problem 
the slew of texas sampl cases and the vast amount of money lost 
prompted the justice department to turn to the new method of 
gaining funds 
throughout the sampl scandal the government has found that the 
assets have disappeared before they can be retrieved runkel said 
out of the dallas bank task force weve had 125 million in 
recovery and the alleged illegal activities and the cost to 
the taxpayers has been substantially more than that in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars out of the dallas cases alone 
runkel said 
what happens is that the assets are not there following a 
conviction he said 
the dallas task force has brought charges against 62 people of 
whom 49 have been convicted the justice department said criminal 
fines against the 49 total 574850 and restitution orders total 
119 million 
attorney general dick thornburgh met tuesday with timothy ryan 
who was sworn in monday as the director of the treasury 
departments office of thrift supervision 
representatives of the two will meet later this week to 
develop specific plans to ensure the most efficient use of the 
resources provided by congress runkel said 
the day before the announcement the administration acknowledged 
that its 50 billion savings and loan bailout will not be enough a 
congressional report has said costs could reach 500 billion if the 
economy falters that estimate includes the governments borrowing 
expenses over 40 years

pilots are complaining about air safety 
conditions over seven us cities but the federal aviation 
administration says test air traffic control rules have caused no 
accidents and no close calls 
the air line pilots association announced tuesday that air space 
over charlotte nc cleveland dallasfort worth los angeles 
memphis philadelphia and phoenix has been added to the 
international black star list of airports and air space that 
could pose problems for pilots 
only one other us site is among 24 locations on the list the 
cyril e king international airport in st thomas us virgin 
islands surrounding terrain requires special training and no night 
flights according to pilot groups 
alpa announced the designations after the international 
federation of air line pilots associations added the seven us air 
spaces to its list 
faa spokesman fred farrar said the pilots complaints arise from 
a test air traffic control procedure used since 1987 at the seven 
cities 
in 20 other sectors over the busiest us airports controllers 
must maintain a separation of three miles between all aircraft at 
the seven cities farrar said controllers under limited 
circumstances need not comply with the set separation between 
aircraft as long as they are kept safely apart 
in two years there have been no accidents and no close 
calls farrar said 
the new standard for the seven cities has been used in the vast 
air spaces between airports for six years also without any 
accidents or close calls he said 
the procedure is only allowed during clear weather when one 
plane is flying by instruments and the pilot of the second plane is 
relying on what he sees out the window farrar said 
alpa said the black star designation does not indicate 
unsafe conditions but is viewed as a serious deficiency in our 
nations aviation safety structure about which unfamiliar pilots 
should be warned 
the added risks coupled with the inability to measure any 
gains in efficiency make this a highly questionable exercise by 
the faa said alpa president henry duffy 
he said the faa benefits from the new system because it reduces 
the number of reportable operational errors making the skies 
appear to be safer no longer do all violations of the threemile 
separation have to be reported he said

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev 
weighted down by the crisis in lithuania and other restive soviet 
republics is resisting proposals from president bush for a 
multisite us summit administration officials say 
the soviets have given a polite nyet to white house 
suggestions that part of the may 30june 3 summit be held at bushs 
oceanside vacation home in kennebunkport maine said officials who 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
chances are that gorbachev who doesnt share bushs love for 
ocean power boating had his fill of waves and spray at their last 
meeting in december aboard the soviet liner maxim gorki tied up 
at malta dock in a mediterranean gale 
also not in the cards a joint bushgorbachev appearance at the 
may 31 commencement at west point bush was scheduled to give the 
keynote address and speculation grew that he might show up with 
gorbachev in tow 
administration officials said they have ruled out any such joint 
appearance and expect that bush will have to cancel his own 
participation because of the summit 
lack of soviet feedback on summit logistics is frustrating 
planning for the superpower meeting that begins seven weeks from 
today the officials said 
the upshot is that the summit probably will be held almost 
entirely in washington with a visit to the presidential retreat in 
camp david md likely to be the only side trip the sources said 
its going to be a working visit no time for sightseeing 
gennadi gerasimov the soviet foreign ministry spokesman said 
pointedly 
still bush has a record of conducting meetings with foreign 
leaders in picturesque or at least interesting places and 
taking them to sporting events 
malta is a hard locale to beat at least in photogenic terms 
but bush plans another island session this weekend when he meets 
with british prime minister margaret thatcher in bermuda 
he conferred with french president francois mitterrand last 
december on the french caribbean island of st martin and meets 
with him again later this month in key largo fla he has also had 
mitterrand to kennebunkport 
for his summit last month with japans prime minister toshiki 
kaifu bush selected a posh desert country club near palm springs 
calif 
he also likes to take foreign leaders to baseball games 
although the white house says there are no particular plans for a 
bushgorbachev outing to the ballpark 
bush joined canadian prime minister brian mulroney on tuesday 
evening for a game in the sprawling toronto skydome and a year 
ago he took egyptian president hosni mubarak to a baltimore 
orioles game mubarak had never seen a baseball game before and he 
seemed baffled 
of course with gorbachev anything is possible just like bush 
he has a history of surprise moves at summits 
for instance the last time he was in washington in december 
1987 he abruptly stopped his motorcade several blocks from the 
white house got out and greeted people on the street 
bush no doubt remembers that event all too well thenvice 
president bush was in an accompanying limousine and seemed at a 
loss to know what to do as gorbachev worked the delighted crowd 
he sat passively in his car for several minutes then as 
gorbachev was preparing to leave bush got out of his limo stood 
by it and waved to the crowd 
gorbachev also maintained his own agenda while in washington 
meeting with various interest groups and members of congress all 
without advance notice to the reagan administration 
white house officials are not ruling out such surprises at next 
months summit either from bush or from gorbachev 
however spokesman marlin fitzwater suggests that some of the 
drama has left such summits because of the frequency of ussoviet 
summits in the six years since gorbachev came to power and because 
of dramatic changes in the communist world 
i think weve long since passed the point where you can only 
meet if you have a treaty to sign he said

an effort to boost tax collections by hiring 
more auditors is backfiring in the short run because senior agents 
who should be auditing returns are training new employees instead 
a congressional study says 
in just five of the 63 internal revenue service districts the 
general accounting office estimated the diversion of auditors to 
train new agents will cost the government 980 million in lost 
taxes 
if the other districts had similar experiences the loss could 
hit 65 billion before the training begins to pay off 
the gao an investigative arm of congress said the government 
lost more than 1 million in taxes over the short run for each new 
worker who completed a 26month training course 
the irs conducted a similar study using different methods and 
came up with a lower figure for lost taxes 
no matter whose methodology is used the conclusion is the 
same unrealized audit revenues associated with training new 
revenue agents have been substantial wrote jennie s stathis 
tax policy director for the gao 
the gao study covered agents who were hired between july 1 
1986 and sept 30 1988 most of them as part of an effort by 
congress to raise the number of tax returns that are audited the 
audit rate has declined steadily for several years from 150 per 
10000 returns in 1983 to an expected 92 per 10000 this year 
ellen murphy irs public affairs director noted tuesday that 
the irs has been under a hiring freeze and has hired no new 
auditors over the past two years 
we dont believe there will be future revenue losses from this 
training factor ms murphy said when we resume hiring we 
will be doing a lot more of online training reserving intensive 
classroom training for contractors and having trainees go 
with experienced auditors to see how the job should be done 
the 61 billion irs budget that president bush has proposed for 
fiscal 1991 would allow the agency to add 2400 auditors to the 
16000 now on its staff 
the gao report indicated it will take as long as four years for 
an earlier effort to pay off it will take that long for tax 
collections to rise enough to offset the costs of hiring new agents 
and the revenue lost by having them trained by senior auditors 
once an auditor is fully trained however the payoff for tax 
collections is significant the gao estimated that senior auditors 
in the irs dallas office recommended additional taxes and 
penalties averaging 5155 for each hour they spent auditing 
returns the los angeles average was 4572 chicago 3777 
atlanta 3273 and san francisco 3032 
during the 19861988 period checked the irs hired 7300 people 
for the job of revenue agent whose chief task is to audit more 
complicated returns including those filed by large corporations 
the five offices that the gao surveyed hired 1103 or 15 percent 
of that number 
the study found that 69 percent of the training assignments for 
those new employees were carried out by agents who had been 
auditing returns at the time they were selected 
as of last june 30 the use of auditors to train the 1103 new 
workers had deprived the government of about 840 million in 
revenues that the interrupted audits would have produced the gao 
estimated the total could rise to 980 million by the time all the 
new employees complete their training 
only 179 of the 1103 new employees had completed all four 
phases of training and the revenue loss was estimated at more than 
104 million for each trainee who completed the course the gao 
said 848 of the 1103 new hires were still with the irs at that 
time

antiindian taunts and posters greeted 
supporters of tribal treaty rights tuesday night at a lake where a 
band of chippewas prepared to open the tribal spearfishing season 
an estimated 350 supporters and opponents of chippewa 
spearfishing gathered at cedar lake in northwestern wisconsin amid 
tight security 
more than 100 law enforcement officials including more than two 
dozen in riot gear were at a boat landing at the lake the lake 
was the only one the st croix chippewas had said they would fish 
many other northern lakes remain covered by ice 
when members of the american indian movement arrived beating a 
drum in support of chippewa spearfishing the crowd swelled around 
them and taunts were exchanged 
red black and white spearing aint right some said 
save the walleye spear the indian one man shouted 
posters held by those in the crowd had such messages as you 
have shamed every native american that ever lived equal 
rights not treaty rights and walleye or welfare make a 
choice 
kevin wakefield of star prairie said he came to the boat landing 
for the first time because indian spearfishing must stop 
they are spearing the walleye out of the lakes it is just 
take take take wakefield said 
some aim members photograped the crowd which adults and 
children 
it was not clear however if there had been any fishing polk 
county sheriff ben ware said he understood one boat of spearers 
went out but state spokesman jeff welch said he understood there 
had been no spearfishing 
the st croix band one of six chippewa bands in wisconsin has 
been authorized to take 2102 walleye from offreservation lakes 
over the course of the spearfishing season that usually lasts three 
weeks said tribal chairman ed bearheart 
before going to the lake about 100 spearfishing supporters 
signed a pledge of peace and donned armbands said barb kass of 
luck coordinator for the treaty support group witnesses for 
nonviolence 
about 25 representatives of the minneapolisbased aim including 
founder clyde bellecourt attended a rally at the st croix bands 
community center before heading to the lake 
since 1983 federal courts have upheld 19th century treaties 
giving the chippewa the right to hunt fish and harvest timber on 
offreservation lands in the northern third of wisconsin 
tensions between chippewa spearers and nonindian critics have 
grown each year since 1985 when the indians renewed active 
spearfishing a year ago 271 spearers caught 16000 walleye 
demonstrations last year opposing indian spearfishing mostly 
near the lac du flambeau reservation escalated into incidents 
involving rockthrowing and racial slurs more than 200 people were 
arrested 
state and tribal leaders have urged supporters and opponents of 
indian spearfishing to stay away from boat landings this spring

the hit teenage mutant ninja turtles will 
come out of their shells even more next fall when they join cbs 
saturday morning lineup 
judy price cbs vice president for childrens programs 
announced tuesday that the network bought rights to 26 original 
halfhour turtles cartoon episodes none of which have 
previously appeared in a separate 65episode package syndicated 
last year to local tv stations for weekday broadcasts 
the cartoon turtles are the hottest thing going now price 
said a liveaction movie version also is a boxoffice hit 
grossing more than 50 million in only two weeks 
price said cbs signed an option for the shows last fall and 
the movie has been the frosting on the cake 
cbs shows produced by the same company that makes the 
syndicated version will appear as a onehour program consisting 
of two halfhour episodes that complement each others story lines 
she said 
price said she was unconcerned that with five weekdays of 
turtles on tv their addition to cbs saturday schedule would 
eventually leave young viewers all turtled out 
in fact quite the opposite has happened she said she 
cited as an example cbs muppet babies which also is 
syndicated for weekday broadcast and still is doing well in its 
sixth season on cbs 
its been shown that children prefer the familiar on tv she 
said while its difficult to lure them to the new and different 
the things that get sampled are the known things the 
comfortable 
the only other new series in cbs saturday schedule is bill amp 
teds excellent adventure based on the movie of the same name 
the halfhour show is about two teenagers traveling through time 
aided by a hipster whose voice is that of comic george carlin 
cbs turtles purchase had been expected by many in the tv 
industry it came as cbs became the last of the networks to unveil 
its fall lineup for saturday mornings an increasingly competitive 
arena in broadcast and cable tv 
unlike nbc which on monday said it was dropping such old 
cartoon reliables as alf and the smurfs and bringing in the 
most liveaction childrens programming in its history cbs new 
schedule remains predominantly animated 
cbs axed california raisins dungeons and dragons and 
the adventures of raggedy ann and andy but is bringing back 
garfield muppet babies dink the little dinosaur and 
cbs storybreak 
its new schedule has only one liveaction show the partly 
animated peewees playhouse a ratings success returning for a 
fifth season 
price said animation is the most tested and true form for 
saturday mornings 
one thing you have to remember children are exposed to live 
action seven days a week she added asserting that contrary to 
commonly held beliefs cartoons only account for ten percent of 
childrens total tv viewing

about 100 elementary school students protesting 
the firing of their principal clashed with stickwielding police 
tuesday and several were injured marking the second such incident 
this year school officials said 
five students aged 11 to 13 suffered bruises and cuts in the 
incident in front of the morrill elementary school on the citys 
southwest side officials at the school said 
several parents charged that officers used unnecessary force in 
breaking up the protest police spokeswoman tina vicini said no one 
was arrested and no student was seriously injured 
officers had been called to help school officials get the 
students back into the building said principal eduardo cadavid 
i guess they thought we werent going fast enough so they hit 
a whole bunch of kids said student charity kinney 
school official sharon hayes said she went outside and noticed 
an officer with a stick 
i told him i thought we could handle this without sticks 
she said he started screaming and hollering and putting his 
stick in my face he told me he knew what his job was 
teacher margaret scott said police came into her classroom and 
threatened students she did not elaborate 
my children were frightened to death she said 
for the past several weeks students have been protesting the 
local school councils refusal to renew cadavids contract 
principal firings have stirred protests at other chicago schools 
in recent months since the chicago school reform act went into 
effect at the start of the year it set up parentled locals

want to follow a pro around the golf 
course without leaving the living room join in a game show 
for the next five weeks television watchers in some 
southwestern massachusetts households get to do just that as part 
of a national test of new interactive television technology 
it gets the couch potato a halfstep up off the couch said 
brian lambert general manager of continental cablevision which is 
beaming the program to 300 subscribers 
the development is part of longpromised changes for television 
cable officials said 
we keep hoping for these things i think this is one of the 
neater presentations ive seen frankly said wendell bailey 
vice president for science and technology at the national cable 
television association 
interactive television has been around for some time starting 
with a twoway television experiment warner amex cable 
communications inc tested in ohio in 1981 what makes the 
springfield tests different cable officials said is the level of 
technological reliability and viewer participation 
being able to manipulate that television to be the director 
to be able to select camera angles or answer questions or respond 
to certain criteria really adds a whole new dimension to watching 
television lambert said tuesday about three weeks into the 
eightweek test of the cable technology developed by actv domestic 
corp of new york 
the actv system is sort of multiplechoice tv said gary 
arlen publisher of the trade newsletter interactivity report 
later this month when a live golf tournament is broadcast actv 
viewers will be able to pick who they want to follow around the 
course choosing from a list flashed up before play begins then 
during the broadcast the viewer can switch at any time to the 
camera trained on that player said steven georgeou of geocom 
consulting a marketing consultant to actv 
viewers also will be able to punch up instant replays and 
statistical information on selected players 
tuesday morning while watching the game show college all 
stars viewers at home were able to make their own choices a 
correct answer brought congratulations from the host when the 
viewer was wrong the host commiserated 
the whole purpose is to find out what people think of this 
kind of technology and what kind of programs do they want to see 
georgeou saidwe also want to understand how many times people 
want to push buttons 
so far consumers have responded positively to the free test 
lambert said 
actv options are installed through a smart box which is a 
little larger than the regular cable converter box the cost of the 
service probably would be about 10 a month georgeou said 
whether actv becomes a regular fixture will depend on whether 
sponsors can be persuaded there is consumer demand for interactive 
television cable officials said

nearly 50 years ago broadcaster eric 
sevareid saw ronald reagan on a warner bros movie lot and 
immediately identified him as mr america 
it was 1941 and as a reporter for then fledgling cbs news 
sevareid also met warner bros stars like gary cooper and marlene 
dietrich but reagan most impressed him sevareid recalled monday 
night in a speech at central missouri state university 
you could see immediately he was the eagle scout mr 
america sevareid said 
in the white house 40 years later reagans appeal did prove 
to be almost irresistible for quite some time sevareid said in 
remarks concerning the relationship between the presidency and the 
press 
i think he did make most people feel better although by his 
second term reagan had nothing new to offer sevareid said 
sevareids son michael is an adjunct lecturer and graduate

ivana trumps lawyers are asking court 
permission to question marla maples and dozens of donald trumps 
associates as they add another swirl to the trump divorce potboiler 
her lawyers also are asking judge phyllis gangeljacob to force 
trump to limit the documents he is demanding that his wife turn 
over in her lawsuit to invalidate the couples postnuptial 
agreements 
among the items his lawyers have asked for are those relating to 
any threats made or undue influence practiced by trump on his 
wife all his wifes personal diaries since 1976 and all letters 
memos notes and greeting cards from him to her 
mrs trumps lawyers filed suit last month challenging trumps 
claim that she waived her right to half his estimated 5 billion 
fortune in a series of postnuptial agreements the last signed in 
1987 
she alleged in the court papers that trump intimidated and 
verbally assaulted her and repeatedly cheated on her she also 
charged her attorney for the agreements was chosen by trumps 
lawyer at the time the late roy cohn and did not act in her best 
interests 
trumps attorneys say the agreement which gives mrs trump 10 
million and their 12 million mansion in greenwich conn is 
ironclad 
mrs trumps spokesman john scanlon said tuesday that after 
mrs trump gives her deposition trump will have to give his and 
mrs trump also will ask court permission to question 40 other 
people including miss maples the woman with whom trump has been 
linked 
jay goldberg one of trumps attorneys said the documents his 
client is seeking would demonstrate without question the 
infirmity of her claim 
he dismissed her plans to call miss maples as posturing 
the hearing on mrs trumps motion is scheduled for may 1

the maker of a bicycle computer agreed to stop 
using twotime tour de france winner greg lemonds name photograph 
or likeness in advertising without his approval 
but the civil lawsuit filed against avocet inc last month by 
lemond remains in effect under the stipulation signed by both 
parties and approved tuesday by us district judge bruce thompson 
lemond endorsed the avocet cyclometer in 1989 for a 60000 fee 
but that contract ended last year and he didnt give his permission 
to continue using his image according to his lawsuit 
lemond since has endorsed another bicycle computer 
michael phillips national sales manager for avocet based in 
menlo park calif has said he doesnt know why the racer filed 
the lawsuit against his company because the ads in dispute depict 
several riders 
nathan jenkins who represents lemond said that although the 
picture shows lemond with a group of other racers during the tour 
de france you can be assured that the american public will only 
recognize greg lemond 
the avocet cyclometer functions as an odometer speedometer 
stopwatch and clock measuring things such as how fast and far a 
bicycle has traveled per trip or during an extended time period

barbara piaseckajohnson who left poland 
to seek her fortune and returned a us multimillionaire has 
opened an exhibit of extraordinary art from her private collection 
at warsaws royal palace 
the opus sacrum exhibit of paintings sculpture and other 
objects with religious themes is being held in support of the 
reforms that culminated in the installation of the east blocs 
first noncommunist government last fall 
mrs johnson wanted to honor these changes in a special way 
by organizing a great cultural event of international 
significance an introduction to the exhibit says 
the old masters displayed include renaissance and baroque works 
by such painters as titian caravaggio and raphael 
they are all my favorites mrs johnson said before guiding 
journalists through the exhibit 
proceeds from the sale of the catalogue and other publications 
from the exhibit will be donated to polish cultural conservation 
efforts especially in the historic southern city of krakow mrs 
johnson said other polish exhibits from her collection are planned 
mrs johnson inherited much of the johnson amp johnson 
pharmaceutical fortune after the death of her husband seward 
johnson on whose household staff she had worked she went through 
an ugly court battle with other johnson heirs over her husbands 
will 
mrs johnson lives in princeton nj at her estate jasna 
polana 
she was hailed as a heroine at the gdansk shipyard where 
solidarity was founded after she offered last june to spend up to 
100 million for an interest in the yard which was threatened with 
liquidation by the thencommunist government 
but the shipyard deal failed to materialize apparently in part 
because workers would not agree to the terms she offered 
mrs johnson bristled when it was suggested tuesday that she 
returned to poland as an industrialist 
that is the wrong idea that i come here as an industrialist 
saving monuments of polish art and history is my purpose she 
said

anatomy more than ability turned larry stidham a 
bluecollar fan of hockey and bruce springsteen into an 
impersonator of luciano pavarotti 
until a few years ago the 43yearold plumber knew little about 
opera 
who is he stidham wondered when his friends mentioned his 
resemblance to the rotund tenor 
but friends insisted he capitalize on the look his 215 pounds 
were no match for the comfortably cushioned pavarotti so stidham 
began expanding to his present 270 and he has the trademark 
pavarotti sparkle in his eyes 
with the stage name bearvarotti stidham dons a tuxedo and 
white tie to plays weddings balls and parties some describe his 
voice as a howling wolf but he gets rave reviews 
i even had people break into tears stidham said tuesday 
there are some differences in his and pavarottis careers 
pavarotti made his opera debut in 1961 in la boheme 
stidham opened in 1984 in a suburban algonquin bowling alley 
also unlike pavarotti who has been banned from the chicago 
lyric opera because of numerous noshows i dont cancel 
stidham said 
in his debut a lipsync contest stidham mouthed the words to 
if we were in love from pavarottis movie yes giorgio 
he placed third but he was hooked 
he bought opera recordings and studied the italian lyrics 
syllable by syllable he watched pavarotti on tv trying to pick up 
his style 
soon stidham was doing events with other chicago area star 
lookalikes a false sammy davis jr a mock willie nelson a 
bogus joan collins 
stidham even dated a crystal gayle lookalike 
my agent is a guy that looks like henry fonda stidham 
noted and i got another agent thats a charlie chaplin double 
bearvarotti met pavarotti once backstage after a 1986 
appearance by the opera singer at chicagos civic opera house 
the two men swapped autographs

even as women make gains in jobs and pay 
their lead is slipping in two areas where they traditionally are 
ahead of men how many there are and how long they live 
women still outlive and outnumber men in america but improving 
life expectancy rates for males allowed their total number to 
increase faster than women during the 1980s for the first time 
since early in this century the census bureau said tuesday 
male life expectancy has continued to improve gradually during 
the decade female life expectancy has improved very little since 
1982 said frederick w hollmann of the census bureau 
life expectancy for men increased from 709 years in 1982 to 
715 years in 1987 an improvement of sixtenths of a year he 
noted during the same time life expectancy for women went up only 
onetenth of a year from 782 to 783 
the reason is that mens death rates for such major killers as 
cancer and heart disease dropped during the decade while the 
cancer rate for women increased and deaths from heart disease only 
edged down 
the male population outgrew the female population in every age 
group under age 85 hollmann reported 
from 1980 to 1989 the number of men in the nation increased by 
10557000 while the female population grew by 10448000 the 
bureau reported 
even so women continue to outnumber men in america 127 million 
to 121 million the report showed 
the last decade in which the number of men increased faster than 
women was 19001910 the census bureau noted 
the balance of population is determined not only by the number 
of people born but by the number of years they remain alive 
explained hollmann 
more male babies are born than females he pointed out but 
generally a sort of equilibrium is reached since males dont live 
as long as females 
the higher death rate for men means that although they outnumber 
women at birth women surpass men in total numbers later on 
one consequence of males increasing faster than females in the 
1980s was that in 1989 there were more men than women at each age 
group below 34 in 1980 men had been more numerous only through age 
26 hollmann reported 
hollmann said a major contributor to the males outpacing females 
in the 1980s was the changing patterns of disease as more and more 
women took up smoking and moved into traditionally maledominated 
jobs and lifestyles 
you could suggest that a lot of women took up smoking back in 
the 1960s so the difference between men and women in smoking 
behavior tended to converge somewhat said hollmann if 
behavior between the sexes is converging then you have to expect 
mortality rates to converge also 
there is a time lag between the time someone takes up smoking 
and the time they come to highest risk of death he said 
accounting for the change in comparative death rates in the 1980s 
between 1982 and 1986 for example the cancer death rate for 
males declined from 1648 deaths per 100000 men to 1636 for 
women the rate increased from 1095 to 1114 
for heart disease the death rate for men declined from 2644 
per 100000 to 2382 women had a smaller decline from 1325 to 
1246 
and deaths from cerebrovascular disease fell from 392 to 335 
per 100000 men from 1982 to 1986 while for women the drop was 
from 332 to 290 also a smaller decline than for men 
the census study used mortality data from the national center 
for health statistics a division of the department of health and 
human services 
while the study did not include a breakdown by sex for 
immigration hollmann said that also was a contributing factor to 
the increase in males since refugees coming into the country 
tended to include somewhat more males than females during the 1980s

the us supply of corn and soybeans has 
tightened because demand has been larger than expected according 
to a new analysis by the agriculture department 
the new supplyanddemand outlook reflected recent figures 
showing that march 1 corn and soybean inventories were smaller than 
expected thus sept 1 corn inventories are expected to be about 
133 billion bushels down from 148 billion forecast a month ago 
reduced us stockpiles are also having an effect on global use 
and supplies of the major grain the report said 
last sept 1 the us corn stockpile was 193 billion bushels 
reduced sharply by low yields caused by the 1988 drought on sept 
1 1988 the corn inventory was 426 billion bushels 
corn prices nationally are expected to average 230 to 240 
per bushel this marketing year up five cents from the march 
forecast but still well below the 254 average of the 198889 
marketing year 
in 198788 before the effects of the drought corn prices 
averaged 194 per bushel the report said 
on the international level the report said global trade in corn 
and other coarse grains is expected to be down slightly from 
the march forecast while world production is largely unchanged 
global stockpiles of coarse grain which include corn sorghum 
barley oats rye millet and mixed grains are expected to be 
down from last months forecast to their lowest level since 198384 
because of the reduced us inventory 
soybean inventories going into the new marketing year on sept 1 
were put at 305 million bushels down from the march forecast of 
330 million however that would be up from 182 million bushels of 
soybeans on hand last sept 1 
the sept 1 1988 soybean stockpile was 302 million bushels 
marketing year prices averaged 588 per bushel in 198788 before 
soaring to 742 in 198889 
with larger production and smaller demand soybean prices are 
expected to average in the range of 555 to 565 this marketing 
year unchanged from the march forecast 
global production of oilseeds which includes soybeans was 
forecast at a record 2132 million metric tons down slightly from 
last month but 5 percent more than last year 
the report showed little change in the wheat supply and demand 
for the 198990 marketing year that began last june 1 
wheat stockpiles are expected to be about 442 million bushels 
this june 1 virtually the same as forecast last month that would 
compare with 702 million bushels on hand last june 1 and 126 
billion bushels on june 1 1988 
nationally wheat prices were forecast at 370 to 375 per 
bushel this marketing year down a nickel at the upper end of the 
range compared with 372 in 198889 and 257 in 198788

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union has bought an additional 125000 metric tons of us wheat at 
subsidized prices for delivery through midmay 
the sale according to usda records was the first since jan 
19 when the soviet unions authority for buying us subsidized 
wheat was virtually exhausted 
a new allocation of 1 million tons was announced feb 23 about 
12950 tons were left over from a previous allocation 
f paul dickerson general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said tuesday the wheat was sold by 
three private companies which will receive subsidies under the 
departments export enhancement program or eep 
dickerson said 887950 tons of wheat remain in the soviet 
unions current eep allocation only wheat has been approved for 
sale to the soviets under the price subsidy program 
the seventh year of the ussoviet grain agreement began oct 
1 with the latest sales the soviet union has bought more than 29 
million tons of wheat for 198990 delivery and more than 127 
million tons of corn plus soybeans and soybean meal all of the 
wheat was sold under eep arrangements 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat the 125000 tons are equal to almost 46 million bushels 
worth about 19 million at recent us farm prices 
dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of 3153 per 
ton or about 86 cents per bushel 
the eep arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and 
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced 
prices to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
dickerson said the latest wheat was sold by j aron amp co 
50000 tons union equity cooperative exchange 50000 tons and 
mitsubishi international 25000 tons

orange harvest prospects are virtually 
unchanged from last month according to new estimates by the 
agriculture department 
production as of april 1 was forecast tuesday at 172 million 
boxes down 18 percent from 209 million boxes last season 
primarily because of a freeze in december 
most of the reduction was attributed to a 30 percent decline in 
the florida crop estimated at 1031 million boxes against 1466 
million in 198889 
the texas crop was indicated at 12 million boxes down from 
185 million in 198889 california production estimated at 66 
million boxes is up from 588 million last season while the 
arizona harvest was indicated at 19 million boxes up from 17 
million last season 
total grapefruit production was forecast at 486 million boxes 
down 30 percent from last year reflecting the freeze in florida 
and texas

group says 
it said some agency other than the nuclear regulatory commission 
perhaps the department of health and human services should set 
the level 
power plant employees are exposed to average radiation equal to 
roughly 20 chest xrays a year more than the what the general 
public is exposed to said ken bossong executive director of an 
energy research project of public citizen a consumer advocacy 
group 
public citizen released a study tuesday showing more nuclear 
power plant workers than ever before were exposed to measurable 
radiation in 1988 albeit at a larger number of plants than ever 
before 
the study found 105265 instances of worker exposure to 
measurable radiation at the 107 commercial nuclear reactors in 1988 
this is the highest number of incidents of worker exposure 
ever recorded by the us commercial nuclear power industry the 
organization said 
it said its study based on documents from the nuclear 
regulatory commission found 104511 such incidents in 1987 and 
100992 in 1986 
the industrysponsored council of energy awareness in a written 
response to the report said that the total number of exposed 
individuals increased only because according to public citizens 
figures there were 10 more nuclear energy plants in operation than 
the year before actually public citizen said there were nine 
more plants 
in any case the industry group pointed out that public 
citizens own numbers show that in 1988 the year on which they 
report the number of workers per plant who were exposed to any 
measurable radiation decline to an alltime low down 22 percent in 
the fiveyear period 19841988 
public citizen has proven once again that they dont let the 
facts stand in the way of their determined antinuclear diatribe 
the statement said 
there were 98 plants operating in 1987 nine fewer than in 1988 
public citizens report acknowledged a decrease in the average 
collective radiation dose of each reactors work force it also 
said the average number of workers exposed per plant and the 
average dose of exposure had gone down by 7 percent between 1987 
and 1988 
experts on both sides agree that the greatest exposure to 
workers comes during reactor maintenance work mostly on older 
reactors 
clearly when you have older plants you do have maintenance 
more often said joseph fouchard a spokesman for the nrc 
but he added with respect to worker exposure to radiation at 
nuclear power plants we believe it has been steadily improving we 
believe the situation is getting better 
public citizen said the united states eventually should stop 
using nuclear power but suggested that as long as the plants 
continue to operate the nrc should lower the limits of worker 
radiation exposure 
the current nrc radiation exposure limit is 500 rems per year 
per worker with 24 times that much permitted for workers whose 
jobs keep them close to the reactor the accepted limit for the 
general population is 500 millirems or onetenth the amount for 
nuclear plant workers the group said 
public citizen suggested having the exposure standards set by 
another government agency possibly the department of health and 
human services 
the group also criticized the lack of a centralized government 
repository for information on the health status of nuclear power 
plant workers

here is the list of the 20 nuclear reactors 
which the consumer group public citizen says were worst at exposing 
workers to radiation in 1988 
the group said it considered the number of exposed workers the 
collective radiation dose to the work force and other factors each 
reactor is listed with its total number of worker exposures to 
radiation for 1988 followed by the average exposure per worker 
expressed in rem 
federal regulations permit a plant worker to be exposed to 50 
rem per year about five times the highest level reported public 
citizen said the average exposure in 1988 was 0390 rem about the 
equivalent of 20 chest xrays 
regulations permit employees who work in closer contact with the 
reactor 24 times more exposure per year a total of 12 rems of 
which no more than 3 rems may be absorbed in any one quarter 
however public citizen chose only to use the figure for workers 
not in close proximity to the reactors 
measured by exposure per worker the la salle maine yankee and 
brunswick plants were the worst in the country

new england is leading the way in 
environmental health while the south has become the nations 
biggest waste dump according to an environmental scorecard of the 
50 states 
the green index a report released this week by the 
durhambased institute for southern studies examined 35 indicators 
of pollution public health workplace safety and environmental 
safety 
the top five states were vermont massachusetts minnesota 
rhode island and connecticut alabama was at the bottom with six 
of its southern neighbors 
george hamilton state planning director in vermont said the 
ranking reflects the environmental policies that have been passed 
over the last number of years there is a strong environmental 
ethic in the state its a bipartisan ethic that has been around 
for 20 years 
but ned farquhar acting director of the vermont natural 
resources council said he was surprised that vermont ranked no 1 
our laws arent that strong and our budget is pitifully low 
for environmental protection farquhar said but the people in 
our towns all care a lot about the environment so i really think it 
all comes back to individual action 
the study ranked the 50 states on a per capita basis and other 
factors that would minimize differences in population size the 
report was based on studies conducted in the mid to late 1980s 
most of them conducted for the federal government said bob hall 
research director for the nonprofit independent institute and the 
studys author 
the study focused on the south and concluded that the region has 
become the nations biggest waste dump handling twothirds of the 
nations hazardous waste 
the bottom five states were tennessee south carolina 
louisiana mississippi and alabama 
hall said alabama brought up the rear because of a combination 
of having some significant problems and not having policies being 
slow in implementing good policies 
environmental officials in alabama do not have enough 
information to judge the report said catherine lamar a 
spokeswoman with the alabama department of environmental management 
but pat byington executive director of the alabama conservancy 
a statewide environmental organization said he was not surprised 
by the states lastplace finish 
the state of alabama has a lot of programs they need to 
institute environmental programs he said we do not have a 
worker righttoknow law we do not have a land acquisition program 
or a toxics reduction program a pollution prevention program and 
we currently do not have a comprehensive solidwaste program so 
were far behind 
the northeast and great lake states fared poorly on the 
institutes poison index which includes standard measures such as 
pollutants air quality and per capita number of superfund sites 
but hall said many of these states have taken aggressive action 
to solve their problems their high scores for policies public 
health and workplace safety initiative boost their overall rankings 
most mountain states score poorly in all areas related to 
government initiative holding fast to the frontier belief that the 
less regulation the better said the report

here is the listing of the nations 107 
commercial nuclear reactors and their worker radiation exposures as 
given by public citizen on tuesday 
the list is alphabetical by name of plant the first number 
after the location is the number of worker exposures in 1988 the 
second number is the average exposure per worker expressed in rem 
federal regulations permit a power plant worker to be exposed to 
50 rem per year public citizen said the average exposure was 
0390 rem which it said was about the equivalent of 20 chest 
xrays 
regulations permit employees who work in closer contact with the 
reactor generally reactor operators and technicians 24 times 
more exposure per year 12 rems with no more than 3 rems aborbed 
in one quarter however public citizen chose only to use the 
figure for nonreactor workers 
measured by exposure per worker the la salle maine yankee and

facing the prospect of losing their 
104yearold dairy farm albert and carol kobbermann became so 
battered emotionally that they considered seeking counseling 
but they didnt take the 30mile trip from their farmstead to 
the clinic in willmar because they feared their neighbors prying 
eyes 
when youre hit pointblank with a problem its what other 
people think that you worry about not whats best for yourself 
carol kobbermann said as she recalled her familys feelings during 
the farm crisis five years agoits difficult to admit that 
things are out of control you feel like a failure 
the stigma of seeking help is one of several difficulties in 
rural mental health care that are to be the subjectd at a public 
hearing thursday in marshall in southwest minnesota its the 
first of four hearings planned this year by the national advisory 
mental health council and the national mental health leadership 
forum 
the biggest problem that we face in rural areas is first a 
culture that says there arent emotional problems in our part of 
the country and second of all if there are we dont admit it 
said rep vin weber rminn who will speak at the hearing 
the extreme financial stress brought a lot of those problems 
out into the open then we had to say hey we really have 
problems with teenage suicide spousal abuse depression and other 
mental and emotional disorders he said p vincent mehmel 
executive director of the west central community services center in 
willmar said the center is busiest during the hard financial times 
farmers who have lost their crop or who have suffered a 
significant loss depression is there mehmel said were also 
subject to the problem of unstable families we once thought 
divorce and child and spouse abuse was an urban problem now its 
a rural problem too 
statistics show the effect of hard times on mental health in the 
sixcounty area with 120000 residents that mehmels center 
serves 
medical assistance reimbursements for mental health care made to 
meeker county residents in 1986 at the peak of the farm crisis 
had increased 907 percent over the figure reported two years 
earlier the figures increased 669 percent in swift county and 
454 percent in chippewa county 
mehmel also deals with the difficulties of recruiting 
psychologists to rural settings where the money prestige and 
cultural amenities dont match those of metropolitan areas 
its hard to get them and when you do get them they move on 
in a few years he said to get a stable staff is a very 
difficult thing 
about 5500 patients visit the centers 30 mental health 
professionals annually no one knows how many are afraid to seek 
help 
the major problem is the mindset that its not ok to get help 
for mental problems said marlyn benson the centers rural 
outreach coordinator youre supposed to be tough and strong 
pull yourself up by your bootstraps dont cry and ask for help 
its easier in a metro area to get help and not have your 
neighbors know people really know your business out here said 
benson who tells of people so embarrassed about visiting the 
center that they park at a shopping mall and walk a quartermile to 
their appointment 
the kobbermanns learned to cope with their stress and depression 
when meetings they organized to discuss the farm crisis turned into 
impromptu neighbortoneighbor counseling sessions later mental 
health professionals were invited to speak to the group 
the kobbermanns feel more secure financially then they did a few 
years ago but if the bad old days return kobbermann believes 
shell cope better than she did a few years ago 
im beyond the point of what the neighbors think she said

a landmark biotechnology case is in the hands 
of californias supreme court which will decide whether a leukemia 
patient can sue for a share of the profits from an anticancer drug 
derived from his cells 
the high court heard arguments tuesday in the case of john 
moore who claims blood cells from his cancerous spleen were 
wrongfully used by the university of california two ucla 
researchers and two drug and biotechnology companies that helped 
develop the drug 
university attorney allen wagner and lawyers for other 
defendants argued that the development of lifesaving drugs will be 
seriously impeded if the justices rule that moore has property 
rights to tissue and cells removed from his body 
they said that would require researchers to negotiate and pay 
for human tissue used for research and drug development 
a decision in moores favor would have a devastating impact on 
medical research said peter abrahams lawyer for defendant 
shirley quan a research assistant at ucla 
moore the 45yearold president of a seattle soft drink 
company said he is merely trying to defend the rights of the 
individual patient in the case where the physicianresearcher is 
also a businessmanentrepreneur 
without my knowledge or consent the doctors and the research 
institutions used a part of me for their own gain moore said 
outside court they stole something from me 
the high courts ruling is expected within 90 days a ruling in 
moores favor would allow his 1984 lawsuit to go to trial the case 
was dismissed by a los angeles superior court in 1986 then 
reinstated in 1988 by a 21 vote of a state appeals court 
during tuesdays 70minute hearing the seven justices asked 
questions that suggested sympathy with moores claim but indicated 
a reluctance to extend personal property rights to cells taken from 
an organ after it is surgically removed 
moore was an alaska pipeline surveyor in 1976 when he sought 
treatment for hairy cell leukemia at ucla dr david golde removed 
moores spleen the standard treatment for the rare leukemia and 
his disease went into remission 
after the spleen was removed golde discovered it contained 
unique blood cells that produced a blood protein called gmcsf now 
in experimental use as a drug to stimulate the immune system to 
fight certain cancers and possibly aids 
moores attorney sanford gage said moore never was told his 
cells had great potential value yet for nearly seven years golde 
and others brought moore from seattle to los angeles for blood and 
other tests while they developed moores cells into a 
selfperpetuating cell line to massproduce gmcsf 
in 1984 ucla received a patent for the cell line naming golde 
and quan as the inventors 
the same year moore sued university of california regents 
golde quan genetics institute inc of cambridge mass and 
sandoz pharmaceuticals corp of east hanover nj 
the lawsuit claimed the defendants wrongfully converted to 
their own use moores personal property namely blood cells from 
his spleen he also alleged they failed to obtain his informed 
consent and breached their fiduciary responsibility to him 
goldes attorney anthony murray argued that moores diseased 
spleen was worthless and golde and other defendants gave 
commercial value to the blood cells through their own efforts 
its not as if you tap a tree and take maple syrup out of it 
put the maple syrup in a bottle and sell it murray said 
diseased tissue has no commercial value 
gage replied that moores cells were vital to creating the cell 
line and the drug 
moore is seeking only that share of drug proceeds that can be 
separated from the efforts of the researchers and manufacturers of 
the drug gage has argued that the market for lymphokines a family 
of drugs that includes gmcsf has been estimated at as much as 3 
billion 
he said deals that led to gmcsfs development and production 
resulted in golde and others getting genetics institute stock now 
worth 3 million ucla and golde also received research grants 
worth 440000 from genetics institute and sandoz gage added 
the doctors were interested in commercial exploitation yet 
they did not reveal that to him justice stanley mosk said 
wasnt there an element of deception 
but justice david eagleson said that if moores claim is upheld 
any patient treated with drugs derived from his cells might be 
accused of illegally converting moores property

edmundo mireles jr an fbi agent who was 
wounded in a miami shootout and later joined a classaction lawsuit 
accusing the bureau of discrimination against hispanics is winner 
of the agencys first medal of valor 
mireles and fellow agents were involved in a shootout outside 
miami on april 11 1986 when they tried to follow a car carrying 
two men they suspected were involved in a series of violent bank 
robberies 
special agent mireles found himself face to face with his 
moment of truth fbi director william sessions said at the award 
ceremony tuesday his fellow agents were down he himself was 
severely wounded 
yet in the face of appalling gunfire he found the courage and 
the stamina to return fire and fatally wounded both michael lee 
platt and william russell matix sessions said 
the medal of valor is given for exceptional acts of heroism in 
the face of lifethreatening situations 
mireles accepted the award in part in the memory of the two 
agents slain that day benjamin grogan and jerry dove and gave 
special recognition to two other agents who helped him survive 
gilbert orantia and ron riesner saved my life on that 
day 
mireles 36 took a year to recover from his wounds which 
shattered one arm 
a federal judge in texas ruling last year on the 1988 
classaction lawsuit filed by 311 hispanic agents found there was 
pervasive discrimination against hispanic fbi agents and ordered 
the bureau to take steps to promote hispanics

the census bureau says at least half the 
people asked to fill out census forms have done so 
we expect the number to grow spokeswoman paulette 
lichtmanpanzer said tuesday 
she said the 50 percent response rate counted only forms that 
have been logged in by census offices across the nation and 
that many places have a backlog of returns waiting to be checked 
the bureau mailed out 88 million forms on march 23 and hand 
delivered an additional 11 million to homes where proper mailing 
addresses could not be obtained 
in addition census takers are working with postal officials to 
correct problems in several communities where forms could not be 
delivered for one reason or another officials said 
if anyone has put off answering the census nows the time to 
do so said lichtmanpanzer stressing the need to increase the 
mail response rate 
census officials have told congress that they hope for a 70 
percent response rate 
census offices will begin sending out workers april 26 to homes 
where no form has been sent back said lichtmanpanzer

in a move bound to fuel speculation about his 
presidential ambitions sen sam nunn dga has resigned from a 
private golf club that lost a legal fight over its refusal to admit 
women members 
i have dropped out for personal reasons nunn said in a 
statement released by his office tuesday in response to questions 
about his membership in the burning tree club located in the 
affluent washington suburb of bethesda md 
nunn who considered running for the democratic nomination for 
president in 1988 did not elaborate on his reasons for quitting 
the club whose members include some of the nations most powerful 
political leaders 
my priority is to run for reelection to the us senate 
nunn said in the statement as i have said many times i have no 
plans or inclination to run for president at no time have i ever 
established a preset time frame for contemplating a decision on a 
future presidential campaign 
nunn chairman of the senate armed services committee was the 
favorite of southern and conservative democrats during the early 
part of the 1988 presidential campaign but he twice refused to 
jump into the race citing family pressures and his senate duties 
the burning tree club has been an allmale bastion since its 
founding in 1922

a study published in a medical journal today 
links job stress with high blood pressure and with changes in the 
heart that often precede coronary disease and heart attacks 
the changes were noted in male workers in new york city ranging 
from garbage collectors to stockbrokers 
the findings based on an ongoing study of 215 men from 30 to 
60 are reported in todays journal of the american medical 
association 
job strain resulted when workers felt they faced high 
psychological demands without having much control over daytoday 
decisions said dr peter schnall lead researcher at cornell 
university medical college in new york 
twentyone percent of the subjects suffered job strain they 
faced up to three times greater risk of having high blood pressure 
than those who did not experience job strain said carl pieper a 
cornell statistician 
all men ages 30 to 40 years old with highstress jobs had a 
clinically significant thickening of the hearts left 
ventricle or chamber a condition that often precedes coronary 
disease and heart attacks pieper said in a telephone interview 
tuesday 
their heart muscles were an average of 20 grams bigger than 
those without job stress a substantial difference but still 
within normal range schnall said by telephone tuesday 
to the best of our knowledge this is the first time a 
psychosocial variable based on job characteristics has been found 
to be related to both hypertension and anatomic increases in heart 
mass the researchers wrote 
if our model is correct job situations where the level of 
work demands exceeds the individuals ability to control or deal 
with those demands creates a challenge that activates the 
sympathetic nervous system and leads to an elevation of blood 
pressure at work 
longterm exposure over years to job strain is hypothesized 
to ultimately result in a sustained elevation of blood pressure 
that then causes structural change in the cardiovascular system 
they wrote 
while the notion that psychological factors can physically 
affect the body is not new it is viewed with skepticism by some 
medical authorities dr redford b williams of duke university 
medical center said in an accompanying editorial 
if these results are considered along with the growing 
contributions of neuroscience to our understanding of how the brain 
speaks to the bodys organs perhaps the idea that the brain plays 
a role in physical disease will soon seem less revolutionary and 
more like normal science williams said 
the men studied had all worked in the same job for at least 
three years none was more than 20 percent overweight and none had 
suffered heart disease before the study began in 1986 
eightyone percent were white the remaining were mostly black 
and 87 had high blood pressure at the start of the study 
the authors concluded that job strain was significantly 
related to high blood pressure and increased heart mass after 
adjusting for factors such as age alcohol intake and smoking 
were not showing that job strain is causing heart disease 
schnall said what were showing is that job strain is causing a 
change in muscle mass that could lead to disease 
the study based on data gathered through 1989 is continuing 
for another five years to determine if the changes are permanent or 
progressive he said

the minds power over the body enables many 
people to keep death at bay while waiting for occasions that are 
important to them say researchers who documented the phenomenon 
among thousands of subjects 
the researchers found marked drops in death rates among jewish 
men before passover and among elderly chinese women before the 
harvest moon festival said a report in todays journal of the 
american medical association 
the results suggest quite strongly that some people are able 
to postpone death briefly in order to reach an occasion which is 
psychologically significant to them said lead researcher david 
p phillips a sociology professor 
in the case of the chinese there was a drop of 35 percent in 
the mortality before the holiday he said in an interview tuesday 
from the university of california at san diego in la jolla there 
was a peak in deaths of 35 percent the week after over what would 
normally be expected 
in the case of the jews the drop was about 24 percent before 
passover phillips said and a corresponding peak in the week after 
the holiday 
in both studies the effect was strongest for cerebrovascular 
diseases such as strokes followed by heart disease and cancer 
the researchers said only natural causes of death were studied 
elderly chinese women were chosen as subjects because they hold 
the central ceremonial role in festival observances the 
researchers said jewish men hold the central role in passover 
findings about the jews were first published in 1988 in the 
british journal lancet but the chinese findings were new both 
groups lived in california where the research was conducted 
the research is very sound said dr cecil g sheps 
distinguished professor of social medicine emeritus at the 
university of north carolina school of medicine at chapel hill 
i think hes done enough of it now to warrant people taking it 
seriously and pursuing studies that would try to determine what the 
mechanism is by which these postponements take place he said in 
a telephone interview tuesday 
phillips and fellow researcher daniel g smith wrote that the 
phenomenon may be due to an unidentified interaction between 
psychology and biology or to careful adherence to medication 
schedules or enhanced care by family or physicians 
birthdays and other significant events can help postpone death 
the researchers said 
a famous example is the death of thomas jefferson the author of 
the declaration of independence on july 4th 1826 exactly 50 
years after the documents signing 
phillips said jeffersons death came only after he had asked his 
physician is it the fourth and received the reassurance it 
soon will be 
fellow signer john adams the nations second president died 
the same day as jefferson 
phillips said the study involving the scanning of computerized 
death records of chinese women 75 years old and over in california 
during the 24week period around the harvest moon festival each 
year for 25 years from 1960 through 1984 
the dip in their death rates before the holiday and subsequent 
peak in death rates immediately afterward was absent among 
nonchinese people the study of about 1900 jewish men had similar 
findings in the nonjewish population around passover

china will send 3000 students abroad this year 
the same number as in previous years but most will be older 
students on shortterm programs an official report said today 
china has stressed that it will continue to send students 
overseas but in the past six months has placed new restrictions on 
studying abroad 
the new regulations were prompted by fears that students would 
not return especially after last years brutal crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement 
authorities are clearly concerned about students being exposed 
abroad to ideas and lifestyles that might make them rebellious or 
inclined not to return 
official reports have said that 3000 students sponsored by the 
central government study overseas each year although one report 
said china sent 5000 students to study abroad last year 
shi weiren an official of the state education commission said 
half of those to be sent this year will be older research students 
and senior scholars applying for sixmonth to oneyear visiting 
scholar programs the official xinhua news agency reported 
four hundred students will enroll in doctoral programs overseas 
shi said in addition 700 students will go abroad on world bank 
loans xinhua said without providing other details 
education vice minister he dongchang said in september that 
china would increase the number of visiting scholars it sends 
overseas while reducing the number in graduate and doctoral 
programs 
he said visiting scholars are able to attain quicker academic 
results than those enrolled in degree programs because their 
overseas stays are shorter visiting scholars also tend to be older 
academics who are more likely to return and are considered more 
politically mature 
shi said facts have shown that sending student abroad is a 
very effective way to introduce into china advanced foreign 
knowledge science and technology and managerial experience and to 
train highly qualified professionals 
in the past 12 years china has sent between 60000 and 80000 
students for education in foreign countries however nearly half 
have failed to return 
in addition more than 20000 chinese students have gone 
overseas on their own and many have stayed abroad 
the new restrictions that have gone into effect recently include 
requiring selffinanced students to work five years before going 
overseas

the only kind of commercials most 
moviegoers want to see in theaters are commercials for other 
movies according to a poll commissioned by walt disney co 
the poll showed that 90 percent of film patrons surveyed 
recently in 10 metropolitan areas oppose showing nonmovie 
commercials disney said tuesday to back up its ban on showing them 
in movie houses with disney films 
a commercial is a commercial and one of the reasons we go to 
the movies is to get away from them jeffrey katzenberg chairman 
of the disney studios said at a news conference theyve been 
booing commercials and the reaction has been getting worse and 
worse 
but the poll found that filmgoers embraced watching coming 
attractions 95 percent are in favor of commercials for upcoming 
movies 
the survey conducted by the national research group canvassed 
18772 moviegoers march 31 in new york boston indianapolis 
chicago austin oklahoma city nashville seattle san francisco 
and in orange county calif 
disney announced in february that it would prohibit onscreen 
advertising in any theater showing films made by disney or its 
affiliated studios touchstone and hollywood pictures 
the ban excludes slides shown during intermission and public 
service announcements approved by disney 
the companys decision was met with criticism from some theater 
owners who count on advertising to boost revenues a number of 
advertisers and advertising buyers were displeased too 
when we first announced our policy we naively thought that we 
were dealing with an issue in which the facts were selfevident 
katzenberg said but even though we received hundreds of letters 
and phone calls supporting our claim there were still skeptics who 
said we had no empirical data 
katzenberg also defended the widespread practice of companies 
paying moviemakers to use their products in films he said his 
studio and others had abused the practice but he averred that 
movies set in the real world should use real merchandise 
he added however that disney no longer would accept payments 
to place alcohol and tobacco in movie scenes

unexplained flashing lights and 
strange circles in the ground are spotted in quebec a saucer zooms 
over houses in newfoundland and a diamondshaped object zips 
through the manitoba sky 
throughout the country people said they saw at least 141 
unidentified flying objects last year according to whats being 
touted as canadas first national survey of ufo sightings 
it tells us that ufos havent gone away it tells us that ufos 
are being seen right across canada said chris rutkowski a 
winnipeg researcher who compiled the study 
rutkowski put together the survey from reports submitted to 
private investigators police and the ottawabased national 
research council which supplied twothirds of the material for the 
study 
such information was always available but never marshalled into 
a form that painted a picture of ufo sightings across the country 
he said 
more than half the reports didnt have enough information to 
evaluate properly and one third had probable explanations said 
rutkowski who has a degree in astronomy and is president of the 
winnipeg branch of the royal astronomical society of canada 
of the rest seven sightings were stamped as solidly unknown 
meaning they were seen by several people and investigated by the 
police and national research council without any explanation being 
found he said 
he related three such incidents 
startled residents of the rural quebec community of 
stemariedemonnoir saw flashing lights glide over a field and out 
of sight the next morning they found strange circles swirled into 
the ground 
at wesleyville newfoundland eight or nine people noticed a 
classic saucershaped object swoop low over rooftops and along the 
shoreline 
and near beaver creek manitoba people reported seeing a 
diamond shape with red lights zip over their car and out across 
lake winnipeg 
rutkowski stresses that he wants to take a rational scientific 
approach to the reports and will not offer any theories about 
unexplained sightings 
but he hopes publicity from the survey will spark more people to 
come forward with their observations providing a larger body of 
evidence that could be investigated by scientists

parents are partly to blame for the high 
dropout rate among hispanic teenagers but economic pressures make 
it hard for many to finish high school witnesses told a hearing on 
hispanic education 
the students have to support their families and i dont think 
thats right said liz cuevas a 16yearold san antonio student 
they say im getting money now i dont know if im going to be 
alive tomorrow 
education secretary lauro cavazos told a news conference after 
he opened the hearing the first of five regional meetings on 
hispanic education that hispanic parents have to get more 
involved in education 
we must have a commitment from hispanics from hispanic 
parents especially that their childern will be educated he 
said that is the first vital step 
the hearing and others to follow in miami chicago los angeles 
and boston were organized by a federal task force on what 
president bush has called the crisis in hispanic education 
during the 1980s about 40 percent of hispanics nationwide left 
school before high school graduation cavazos said the rate for 
all groups in the united states is 30 percent 
only 11 percent of hispanics complete four or more years of 
college by the time they are in their early 30s cavazos said 
gloria rodriguez executive director of the avance family 
support project in san antonio testified that a study by her 
organization found one reason students drop out is that their 
parents dont expect them to finish high school 
parenting is not something that comes naturally it is a skill 
that you learn said ms rodriguez whose program helps parents 
learn about child care while furthering their education and job 
training 
louis j agnese jr president of incarnate word college in san 
antonio said lack of money lack of preparation and perceptions of 
failure cause hispanics to leave school 
agnese proposed a national marketing campaign showing 
achievement through hispanic role models he also said politicians 
must find equitable funding for all school districts 
cavazos defended his remark to the texas legislature last month 
that a large infusion of money is not necessarily the answer to the 
states school funding woes 
i said that it is not appropriate for me to come here and tell 
you how to find the money cavazos said i also said i do not 
doubt that there are some school districts in this state that need 
additional funding

gov judd gregg vetoed what he called the 
nations most liberal abortion rights law less than two weeks 
after his counterpart in idaho rejected the most restrictive state 
abortion bill 
the bill gregg vetoed would have allowed unrestricted abortions 
until the fetus could live outside the womb and after that to 
protect the life or health of the mother or if the fetus had a 
lifethreatening physical or congenital abnormality 
this bill authorizes abortion for convenience sex selection 
as a form of birth control and with or without parental 
notification or consent in the case of a minor gregg said 
tuesday in his veto message to the legislature 
government has an obligation to protect life the republican 
governor said and life begins at conception 
i obviously will not support legislation which represents a 
dramatic expansion of the availability of abortion as a means of 
terminating life in new hampshire he said 
idaho gov cecil andrus on march 30 vetoed a bill that would 
virtually have banned abortions for the purpose of birth control 
gregg took issue with supporters who claimed the new hampshire 
bill sustained the principle of the 1973 us supreme court 
decision that legalized abortion 
this bill allows abortion throughout the term of pregnancy 
including arguably as late as the ninth month if the health of 
the mother is an issue said gregg who called that a term so 
vague as to be worthless as a limiting function 
opponents of the measure praised gregg 
we thank god for a victory here it shows the governor is a 
man of integrity and he kept his promise said russell pond 
director of the new hampshire pro life council 
abortion rights advocates argued that the bill essentially 
legalized current practice they said 91 percent of all abortions 
in the country are done in the first 12 weeks and that only 01 
percent are done after 24 weeks 
this is a sad day for freedom in new hampshire said robert 
spurrier the states spokesman for planned parenthood of northern 
new england 
he said gregg turned his back on the solid prochoice majority 
of new hampshire citizens 
originally the bill allowed unrestricted abortions through the 
24th week but the senate changed that to a fetal viability 
standard determined by the womans doctor 
gregg said that meant abortions could be performed as late as 
the seventh month depending on the doctors view 
house leaders havent set a date to consider overriding the 
veto two earlier votes on versions of the bill failed to generate 
the twothirds margin needed for override

state officials are starting a 286 
million ad campaign financed by a tax on cigarettes that they 
hope will convince threequarters of californias smokers to kick 
the habit by the year 2000 
beginning today ads with some of the strongest language ever 
used to attack smoking and tobacco companies will appear on 
television radio in newspapers and on billboards throughout the 
state said dr kenneth kizer head of the state department of 
health services 
the money for the effort is coming from a 25cent per pack tax 
hike authorized under proposition 99 a referendum passed last 
year that brought the total state tax to 35 cents a pack 
the tv commercials are aimed especially at youths pregnant 
women and minorities they sharply condemn the way tobacco 
companies sell their products 
one commercial shows a smokefilled room packed with cynical 
executives devising a marketing campaign for cigarettes 
one executive discusses the need to lure 3000 new smokers every 
day to replace smokers who die from tobaccorelated illnesses or 
who quit 
were not in business for our health the executive sneers 
this is going to be a media campaign about a media campaign 
as much about hype as hygiene says one advertisement running in 
30 newspapers it accuses the tobacco industry of predatory 
marketing the selective exploitation of the young the selling of 
suicide 
kizer said the 15month campaign will be bigger than any run 
before 
the average state spends about 100000 a year on antitobacco 
messages and education he said 
but the tobacco industry kizer said spent about 32 billion 
in 1988 for advertising and promotion 
the state hopes the campaign in tandem with teaching programs 
will lead to a 20 percent decrease in smoking by june 1991 and a 75 
percent reduction by 2000 
about one in four of californias 29 million residents smoke 
buying more than 2 billion packs of cigarettes a year 
tobaccorelated disease costs about 56 billion and kills about 
30000 people annually in california kizer said 
brennan dawson a spokeswoman for the tobacco institute an 
industry group based in washington dc said the ads are an 
attack on the tobacco industry rather than an attempt to educate 
the public about smokings health risks 
it is a pretty farflung idea that if you attack the tobacco 
industry youre going to get people to stop smoking youre 
propagandizing she said 
kizer accused tobacco companies of targeting teenagers in order 
to hook customers when theyre young and of pushing its products 
at recently arrived immigrants who dont know how dangerous smoking 
is 
ms dawson said the industry believes adults should have the 
right to smoke 
the industry is very much opposed to young people smoking we 
dont want them for our customers she said cigarettes are 
products for adults like many other things are products for adults 
such as alcoholic beverages or cars 
steve kessler health services department assistant director 
said the states ads are meant to counter the industrys seductive 
marketing of smoking 
smoking is not sexy kessler said smoking is not 
glamorous its not youthful thats the message were trying to 
sell smoking is dirty smoking is dumb from a health perspective 
radio commercials feature a series of comedians telling jokes 
about topics like smokers breath smokers hack tobaccostained 
hands and the expense of smoking 
a crazy thought says one comedian i mean why sell 
cigarettes why not just sell phlegm and cut out the middle man 
i think some of the ads are going to be controversial and 
there will be some debate over them kessler said but first 
and foremost were trying to protect the health of californians 
smoking is the leading preventable cause of death and disease 
killing more people than alcohol illegal drugs accidents 
homicides and suicides combined said state health and welfare 
secretary clifford allenby 
smoking is associated with an increased risk of heart disease 
stroke high blood pressure emphysema and several kinds of cancer

the tokyo stock exchanges chief index erased its 
early gains and fell back today as the dollar quickly rose against 
the japanese yen in the afternoon 
the dollar ended at 15850 yen up 035 yen from tuesdays close 
of 15815 yen it opened lower at 15760 yen and ranged between 
15750 and 15850 yen 
the currency rose as investment trust companies bought it for 
technical position adjustments following the currencys lower 
opening in tokyo after its overnight downswing on overseas markets 
dealers said 
many players including institutional investors remained on the 
sidelines said shinzo yamamoto a trader with daiwa bank 
the dollar started rising as market players bought it when it 
fell as low as 15750 yen but there was no dollarselling drive to 
push it back he said 
on the stock exchange the 225share nikkei stock average lost 
18440 points or 062 percent ending the day at 2944028 points 
the index regained 32033 points or 108 percent at the end of 
morning trading on tuesday it lost 77325 points 
volume on the first section where most blue chip stocks are 
listed was a thin 500 million shares down from 550 million the 
previous day 
a nomura securities trader attributed the indexs afternoon 
losses to the yens downturn and an increase in the commercial 
paper cp rate 
the market was largely discouraged by the upswing in the cp 
rate which rose above 7 percent he said adding that the 
increase renewed fears of increased interest rates 
cps are unsecured promissory notes for corporations issued to 
provide shortterm financing they are sold at a discount and 
redeemed at face value and their rates are considered a key 
indicator of shortterm interest rate movement 
higher interest rates tend to discourage stock investment 
japans central bank raised its official discount rate last month 
to 525 percent from the previous 425 percent but japans central 
bank and finance ministry have since ruled out any additional 
discount rate hike 
in earlier trading the nikkei rose following the yens higher 
opening against the dollar traders said 
the yen plunged yesterday because of doubts about group of 
seven cooperation in supporting the yen but its overnight gain 
overseas wiped out such fears among japanese participants said 
katsuya igarashi a trader with new japan securities co 
bank of japan governor yasushi mieno after returning from a 
meeting of financial authorities of the g7 nations in paris last 
weekend said they had pledged to intervene in currency markets to 
support the falling yen 
the g7 is composed of japan canada the united states 
britain france italy and west germany 
but market analysts say some g7 nations regard the yens 
weakness as japans internal problem and are reluctant to help the 
currency rise unless japanese financial authorities take further 
steps such as raising domestic interest rates traders said 
japanese market players generally assume the same 
stock traders said the key to a stock market recovery is the 
yens stability 
discouraged by the yens downswing the price of the benchmark 
no119 japanese government bonds closed at 8630 points down from

john e lists attorney has conceded that 
the former sunday school teacher killed his family 18 years ago 
but how long list is likely to spend in prison depends on the 
jurys reading of his mental state 
lists attorney elijah l miller jr rested his case tuesday 
and the jury was expected to receive it today 
the bulk of millers defense depended on a psychiatrist and a 
psychologist who testified that list suffered from an 
obsessivecompulsive disorder that prevented him from acting 
rationally 
because of this disorder the pressures of impending bankruptcy 
and his wifes terminal illness miller has argued list could see 
no alternative other than to murder his wife mother and three 
children on nov 9 1971 
on monday superior judge william le wertheimer ruled that the 
jury could find list guilty of seconddegree murder carrying a 
30year maximum prison term or first degree murder which carries 
a life term 
for a firstdegree conviction the state must prove that list 
acted willfully premeditatively and deliberately a point that a 
psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution stressed tuesday 
at all times john list was capable of deliberating upon the 
deed dr steven s simring said 
list definitely had an obsessive personality but his 
condition could not be defined as a personality disorder said 
simring who read from what he said were notes of lists chilling 
account of the killings 
it was a horrible thing but when i started it was like i was 
on auto autodrive it was almost with a sigh of relief that i 
killed all of them and there werent one or two survivors list 
was quoted as saying 
simring said list told him he shot his wife helen 46 at the 
breakfast table while she had toast and coffee then went to the 
third floor and shot his mother alma 85 at close range 
he left to do errands returned for lunch and killed each child 
successively patricia 16 john 15 and frederick 13 
simring said list choked up and became teary at the point in the 
interview when he talked of shooting john as simring went through 
his notes list hunched forward in his chair and his face turned 
red 
list who had been living in virginia under an assumed name was 
arrested in june after a caller responded to a televised show about

consumed the harrison oil corp a distributor of engine 
lubrication oils and pesticides said norman wichman the fire 
chief the cause has yet to be determined

fumes and heat and another gashed his face when he fell

boxes in a stock area was extinguished with foam from an airport 
fire truck

the parents who rejected 11yearold rick because they said he 
wouldnt bond with them have refused for three months to allow 
the boys to see each other 
the issue became public when the parents were sued earlier this 
month by cook county public guardian patrick t murphy 
rick not his real name was told of the meeting on monday at 
the foster home where he lives 
hes very very happy about it murphy said tuesday but 
the next thing he said was when is the next visit at this point 
we have to say we dont know 
ricks 9yearold brother is still living with the suburban 
bellwood couple 
murphy said the parents concession for a single visit is cruel 
and likened it to a chinese water torture 
one visit doesnt mean anything he said rick cant go 
through the rest of his life wondering when he will be allowed to 
see his brother again 
the boys have been permitted three visits and three telephone 
conversations after the parents took rick to the orphanage in 
november more than five years after the adoption the last visit 
was shortly after christmas 
the parents identified in court papers as pamela and joseph 
doe adopted the brothers in august 1984 the state took the boys 
from their natural mother because she was accused of abusing them 
the county is seeking a court order compelling the parents to 
allow the boys to visit each other it also seeks 50000 for 
alleged emotional distress to rick

the rev daniel j berrigan his brother 
philip and six other protesters have been spared further jail time 
for a 1980 protest in which they damaged nuclear missiles and 
poured blood on documents 
a judge on tuesday ruled that the time the plowshares eight 
defendants had already served was sufficient punishment but he 
warned that further lawbreaking could send them back behind bars 
common pleas judge james buckingham who was assigned to handle 
the resentencing in the town outside philadelphia expressed 
sympathy for the defendants although he did not condone their 
actions 
the defendants were attempting to make a statement of their 
deepfelt convictions he said i agree with many of those 
convictions we are all concerned about nuclear war 
the eight including three priests and a nun were convicted in 
1981 of burglary conspiracy and criminal mischief they were 
originally sentenced to terms ranging from 1 to 10 years and had 
served sentences ranging from five days to 9 months 
i think it was a fair decision and for once we ran into a 
decent judge said philip berrigan 66 of baltimore what he 
did was totally unexpected 
i was all set to go to jail said daniel berrigan 68 of 
new york displaying a toothbrush he was carrying 
the other defendants were the rev carl kabat 56 of baltimore 
attorney john schuchardt 45 of madison conn dean hammer 35 
of new haven conn elmer maas 51 of new york molly rush 57 
of pittsburgh and anne montgomery 62 of new york 
the convictions stemmed from a protest on sept 9 1980 at the 
general electric co plant in king of prussia the defendants took 
hammers to the nose cones of two minuteman 3 nuclear missiles and 
poured blood on papers 
claiming they didnt get a fair trial the defendants appealed 
through state and federal courts the us supreme court refused to 
hear the case in october 
we did not act out of anarchy but out of a belief that men 
shall not kill maas told the judge we shun the use of killing 
and violence as a way to protect power 
maas is serving a prison sentence for another protest two other 
defendants kabat and ms montgomery are also serving prison terms 
for protests 
i am sorry that all of us didnt go free and i was sorry to 
see our three friends leave the courtroom in handcuffs daniel 
berrigan said 
the judge formally sentenced the defendants to minimum sentences 
equal to time already served but he said lawbreaking in a future 
protest would be a violation of parole that would return them to 
prison 
he asked each of the defendants whether they planned to continue 
their protests none ruled it out 
kabat who has been in jail for 5 years said i would 
certainly rest for awhile 
the defendants took their name from the biblical prophecy that 
swords will be beaten into plowshares 
in a statement the defendants said we saw our action as one 
of hope for the future and gratitude for gods creation which was 
and is under threat of planetary extinction we wanted our action 
to ring with the truth that everyone can take responsibility for 
the weapons produced in our name 
outside the courthouse scores of supporters held a vigil 
if firstrate weaponry like nuclear missiles are judged within 
the law and what we did is outside of it so be it and we will go 
to prison in good spirit daniel berrigan told the judge 
hammer said the judge should choose against nuclear weapons 
rather than punishing the defendants 
somehow governments have the right to act insanely he said 
if an individual acted like the government he or she would be 
locked away what we did was right

a lawmaker proposed adding a 
declaration of childrens rights to floridas constitution but the 
idea was tabled when other legislators said they couldnt guarantee 
freedom from want for children 
the amendment discussed tuesday by the house children amp youth 
committee outlines rights to food housing clothing medical care 
education and protection from abuse neglect and exploitation 
republicans praised the sponsor rep mike langton 
djacksonville for his motives but went on to express doubts 
history has shown that there are events beyond anyones 
control famines and disease and war and all kinds of things that 
occur that dont guarantee us this said rep david troxler of 
jacksonville 
the amendment would generate lawsuits from children who thought 
their needs werent met said rep j bruce hoffman of south miami 
the proposal could encourage families to abandon their own 
responsibilities said rep richard graham rormand beach 
one of the panels six republicans rep tim ireland of cape 
coral offered an amendment to strike the phrase guaranteed 
freedom from want but after it was approved on a voice vote 
langton the chairman of the committee asked that it be 
rescheduled so that he would have time to consult with committee 
members on the wording 
a staff report concluded that the state needs almost 1 billion 
more to implement the childrens services now mandated by law 
theres so much unmet need out there that if we dont make 
a statement that they shall be guaranteed these rights i dont 
think they ever will be langton said

a student died today of injuries he 
suffered in street battles between supporters of rival political 
parties and thousands of troops hit the streets to try to avert 
more bloodshed 
hundreds of wailing people had camped outside a city hospital 
where najeem ahmad 22 had been in a coma since friday 
authorities said up to 10000 troops were deployed after his 
death was announced to prevent any retaliatory acts by his 
supporters who blame a rival political party that represents 
indian immigrants 
ahmad belonged to prime minister benazir bhuttos pakistan 
peoples party 
meanwhile the militant leader of the indian immigrants altaf 
hussein pressed on with a hunger strike he began to demand the 
release of 21 supporters arrested in fridays violence 
thousands of wailing supporters have kept a vigil outside 
husseins home and doctors weaved their way through their 
prostrate bodies to check on the hunger striker 
as many as 60 people have died in the last month in pitched 
battles between supporters of ms bhutto and hussein 
a onetime ally of ms bhutto husseins mohajir qami movement 
switched allegiances in november when he gave his partys 14 
national assembly votes to the opposition the defections led to a 
noconfidence vote which ms bhutto narrowly survived 
rivalries between the pakistan peoples party and the indian 
immigrants movement erupted in violence in early february when 47 
people were killed and scores injured in a single day of shooting 
there were sporadic gunfights until friday when a 24hour 
shooting spree left 17 people dead and 55 wounded including ahmad 
police arrested 30 people 
troops were ordered into central karachi on sunday after hussein 
began his hunger strike and today several took up positions 
outside karachis civic center the busiest intersection in this 
port city of 8 million 
hussein has demanded the release of 20 of his followers as well 
as a karachi municipal councilor khalid bin walid who was 
arrested in connection with the shooting of ahmad walid belongs to 
husseins party 
so far the sindh province government dominated by ms bhuttos 
party has refused husseins demands

king birendra has withdrawn from politics 
and wants the government to ease the hostility and bitterness 
caused by the bloody crackdown on the prodemocracy movement the 
foreign minister said today 
state radio said all charges would be dropped against activists 
arrested since the movement began on feb 18 the opposition says 
about 300 political prisoners are in jail 
foreign minister pashupati ranas comments were the first on the 
kings role in nepals new multiparty system which birendra 
established on sunday by lifting a 29year ban on political parties 
rana told reporters talks were continuing with a centrist party 
and a leftwing coalition on the formation of a provisional 
government 
the nepali congress party and the united left front said tuesday 
that they would not participate in the proposed government unless 
the current partyless national assembly the rashtriya panchayat 
is dissolved 
the two parties led the sevenweek prodemocracy campaign that 
forced birendra to establish a multiparty system 
rana refused to give details about the talks allow us the 
privacy of dialogue if you want the process of orderly and 
democractic nepal to continue 
for 29 years there was virtually no dialogue no discussion 
we hardly knew each other we settled that in two days from a 
highly troubled situation we brought the country to a fairly 
stable situation he said 
political parties were banned in nepal in 1961 when the 
democratically elected government headed by the nepali congress 
party was sacked by birendras father mahendra ending nepals 
only experiment with westernstyle democracy 
the king has wielded power through a largely rubberstamp 
government and a national assembl dominated by his nominees 
the congress party went underground and continued to campaign 
for multiparty democracy 
a leftwing coalition joined it on feb 18 setting off a 
popular movement supported by academicians doctors engineers 
pilots and peasants 
the government last cracked down on friday when troops fired on 
200000 demonstrators as they marched on the royal palace 
witnesses said at least 200 were killed the government said 10 
people were killed and 107 injured 
for oneandahalf months a period of harshness of great 
casualties of great loss of lives has gone through this country 
we want to heal these wounds to soothe anybodys feelings wherever 
they are hurt rana said 
rana said the king by removing a reference to the ban on 
parties in the constitution has relinquished participation in 
active politics 
staterun radio continued to refer to the government as his 
majestys 
to a question on the king tolerating criticism of the monarchy 
rana said freedom of expression has been established it is 
more likely that there would be praise of the king 
under nepalese law the press or citizens are not allowed to 
criticize the institution of monarchy and the royal family 
although criticism of the government is tolerated reporters who 
have broken the law have been jailed 
birendra 44 is the heir of the shaha dynasty which has held 
the throne since the middle of the 18th century 
many nepalis especially farmers who comprise the bulk of this 
countrys 17 million people view him as the reincarnation of the 
hindu god vishnu

labor leader shimon peres failed today to 
present a new government to parliament for approval after two 
members of an ultraorthodox religious party defected from his 
coalition at the last minute 
the dramatic turnaround was a major embarrassment for peres who 
only hours before had predicted he would have a 6160 majority in 
the 120seat knesset or parliament and had named his candidates 
for the proposed cabinet 
peres who had vowed to make peace talks with palestinians his 
first priority told president chaim herzog in a letter that he 
would need more time 
peres bid to form a coalition fell apart when two hardline 
members of the ultraorthodox agudat israel party backed out the 
defectors oppose a government that depends on arab members of the 
parliament for support and they also reject the return of occupied 
land in exchange for peace 
pandomonium broke out in parliament when it became clear that 
peres lacked a majority and lawmakers shouted and wagged fingers 
at each other 
at one point four security guards surrounded a rightwing 
lawmaker who appeared to threaten arab parliament member abdul 
wahab daroushe 
parliament speaker dov shilansky a member of the rightwing 
likud bloc ruled there would be no point in going forward with a 
vote after reading a letter from peres saying labor had failed in 
its attempt to form a government 
shilanksy rejected calls by likud supporters to go ahead with 
the vote which could have further embarrassed peres with a tie or 
a loss 
i do not believe that there is any point in inviting peres to 
the podium to present his government since he announced that it is 
not in his hands shilansky said 
he said he lacked the authority to grant peres an extension of 
48 hours which was sought by labor the ruling left the decision 
in the hands of the president 
herzog who granted peres three weeks to form a government on 
march 20 is empowered to grant peres an extension of up to 21 days 
peres supporters said he would request up to three weeks more 
the presidents office said peres was expected to visit later in 
the day 
meanwhile israel radio reported efforts were under way to bring 
together another laborlikud coalition in which yitzhak rabin of 
labor and the incumbent yitzhak shamir of likud would each take 
turns being prime minister 
asked about the possibility peres said on israel television 
that he had received a mandate from the party to form a government 
that would give a positive reply to us secretary of state james 
a bakers proposals for a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
he said he had asked the agudat israel party if it could still 
guarantee him the backing of all five of its parliament members 
after the two hardliners avraham verdiger and eliezer mizrahi 
announced they would oppose a laborled coalition 
earlier peres declined to tell reporters his plans but said 
i think i have a chance when asked if he could still form a 
government 
labor sources said peres needed an extra two days to give the 
augudat israel party time to replace or bring into line verdiger 
and mizrahi 
verdiger announced his resignation from parliament it would 
take two days for his resignation to take effect after which he 
could be replaced 
mizrahi said that as an act of conscience he would oppose a 
laborled government despite his partys decision to accept peres 
for the peace and safety of the 3 million jews of this 
country i oppose the government said mizrahi 
in this predominantly secular country agudat israel and other 
small religious parties hold disproportionate sway by virtue of the 
split between the countrys two major forces labor and the 
rightwing likud bloc 
in recent days people have staged mass rallies and hunger 
strikes demanding electoral reform such as direct election of the 
prime minister

a federal judge has dismissed perjury 
charges against a former ptl pastor for lack of evidence 
the rev sam johnson was accused of lying to a federal grand 
jury in 1987 and 1988 saying he did not remember where he got 
10000 in cash to lend former ptl top executive richard dortch 
that money was to pay for former church secretary jessica hahns 
silence about a 1980 sexual encounter with ministry founder jim 
bakker 
bakker is serving 45 years at a minnesota prison after being 
convicted in october of mail and wire fraud and conspiracy 
us district judge robert potter dismissed the charges tuesday 
saying i think im afraid if i let it go to the jury i would 
cause this defendant to have to go through the appeals process 
johnson 50 hugged his wife joyce and sobbed when potter 
announced the decision after both sides presented their cases 
i feel born again fridays coming and easters not far away 
for me im glad it came early johnson said outside the 
courthouse 
jerry miller the assistant us attorney who prosecuted bakker 
and who testified tuesday about johnsons statements to the grand 
jury said he thought the governments case went as well as he 
expected 
judge potter obviously had a difficult call to make miller 
said we stated our position he disagreed thats his function 
johnson reiterated his testimony that he never denied making the 
loan to dortch and never denied that the funds could have come from 
mission funds or another source 
earlier in the day a former ptl executive testified that johnson 
used church offerings to provide the money paid to ms hahn 
david taggart a former bakker aide serving 18 years in prison 
for tax evasion said he attended part of a meeting in which dortch 
arranged the loan with johnson 
dortch is serving eight years in prison he pleaded guilty in 
august to mail and wire fraud and conspiracy and agreed to testify 
against bakker in a plea bargain with prosecutors 
reverend dortch shared with sam johnson that a woman had 
alleged she had been raped and that money was needed for 
psychological counseling taggart testified 
taggart said johnson then agreed to lend him the 10000 and 
said the money would come from church offerings 
johnson had been charged with 12 counts of perjury and faced 
five years in prison and a 250000 fine if convicted

a leading iranian newspaper today said 
the release of three western hostages in lebanon should be a 
prelude to freedom for all hostages because keeping people captive 
contradicts islamic teachings 
it was the third time in as many months that the tehran times 
had advocated the release of western hostages held in lebanon by 
militant proiranian groups 
in fact the issue of hostagetaking should come to an end for 
all with no discrimination said an editorial in the newspaper 
which often reflects the opinions of president hashemi rafsanjani 
rafsanjani and other iranian moderates have stressed their 
support for releasing the hostages held in lebanon seeing it as a 
way of improving ties with the west at a time iran seeks financing 
and technical aid 
but radical hardliners who apparently hold greater sway over 
those holding the hostages have repeatedly said they support 
hostagetaking as a way to confront the corrupt west 
irans official islamic republic news agency carried excerpts of 
the tehran times editorial which said iran was working to get all 
hostages freed 
iran finances hezbollah or party of god the umbrella group for 
the shiite moslem factions holding most of the 18 western hostages 
in lebanon 
frenchwoman jacqueline valente 32 belgian fernand houtekins 
43 and their daughter sophieliberte 2 were released tuesday by 
the palestinian terrorist group led by abu nidal and flown to paris 
the tehran times said it hoped their release was a prelude to 
freedom of all hostages regardless of their nationality religion 
and belief 
the libyabacked guerrilla group held them for nearly 2 years 
after grabbing them from a yacht off the gaza strip in 1987 
palestinian sources said the three had arrived in lebanon from 
libya by boat days before their release 
because they were believed held in libya their case is 
considered unrelated to the 18 westerners held in lebanon the fate 
of those hostages is believed linked to a power struggle in the 
iranian government 
the hostages in lebanon include eight americans four britains 
two west germans two swiss and irishman and an italian 
the longestheld is terry anderson the 42yearold chief middle 
east correspondent for the associated press who was kidnapped march 
16 1985 
most have been held for more than three years 
hostage brian keenan an irishman who taught english at the 
american university of beirut marked his fourth year as a hostage 
today with no word on his whereabouts 
no group has claimed to hold the 39yearold from belfast but 
he was seen kidnapped by gunmen as he walked to the university 
campus on april 11 1986 shortly after he took up his teaching 
post in beiruts moslem sector 
the tehran times said a large number of moslems held in israeli 
jails should also be considered hostages because they were 
imprisoned without due process freedom for hundreds of lebanese 
shiite moslems jailed in israel has been a repeated demand of all 
the groups claiming to hold western hostages 
the other demand has been freedom for 15 men some related to 
influential shiites in lebanon jailed in kuwait they have been 
imprisoned since 1983 for bombing attacks on the french and 
american embassies kuwait has said their prison sentences are not 
negotiable

united nations peacekeeping troops 
have arrived in honduras to begin disbanding the contra rebels 
while the ruling sandinistas warned there could be renewed fighting 
a contingent of 170 venezuelan paratroopers arrived tuesday in 
honduras where the contras have base camps 
their spanish commander gen agustin quesada gomez said 
venezuela will send 700 soldiers they will be joined by troops 
from several other countries 
the united nations observer force will supervise the 
demobilization in both honduras and in nicaragua and the 
destruction of their ussupplied arms 
the contras on nicaraguan territory are supposed to gather in 
safety zones once the un peacekeeping force can ensure a 
ceasefire about 9000 contras have gone back to nicaragua in 
recent months leaving the honduran camps nearly deserted 
the rebels agreed monday to begin disbanding the remains of the 
honduran force on april 18 but have not set a deadline for 
demobilization inside nicaragua the sandinistas were pessimistic 
about demobilization tuesday 
the leftist partys newspaper barricada and the prosandinista 
daily el nuevo diario ran editorials and stories calling the accord 
nothing but a ploy to gain time and influence before the april 25 
inauguration of nicaraguas conservative presidentelect violeta 
barrios de chamorro 
they also accused the rebels and her united national opposition 
of trying to take over the sandinista peoples army 
unless this situation is resolved in the briefest term all 
the efforts for peace and reconciliation could revert into a 
fresh outbreak of the war barricada said 
barricadas editorials are considered the official sandinista 
party line 
the war between the usbacked contras and the sandinistas has 
killed an estimated 30000 people since it began in 1981 two years 
after the sandinistas came to power in a revolution that toppled 
rightist dictator anastasio somoza

solidarity leader lech walesa told 
reporters today that his announcement that he would run for 
president was misconstrued and that he meant only to encourage more 
rapid reform 
walesa said his metaphor about running for president in 
comments to the official polish news agency on tuesday was a 
warning to the government to work faster in transforming poland 
from a communist to a democratic system 
nevertheless politicians in poland expressed little doubt today 
that walesa would run for president with the only question being 
when the voting would take place 
president wojciech jaruzelskis term is not due to end until 
1995 but there is a strong possibility that a general election for 
president will be moved up as part of an overhaul of the polish 
constitution 
the most likely time for elections appears to be spring 1991 
when poland would be marking the 200th anniversary of its first 
written constitution 
jaruzelski is a former head of the nowdissolved communist party 
that ruled poland until popular forces led by solidarity won 
control of the government last year 
he was elected by a parliament seated after elections that were 
only partially free and under an arrangement that allowed his 
allies to hold on to the defense and interior ministries in the 
solidarityled government 
it had been widely expected that walesa would seek to force 
jaruzelskis early resignation 
there has been no comment from jaruzelski or his aides about a 
walesa presidential bid jaruzelski began a trip to the soviet 
union today 
walesa speaking with reporters today during a visit to his 
gdansk union headquarters by czechoslovak deputy premier jan 
carnogursky predicted his remarks would lead to a political 
backlash 
as a result of the announcement i will surely not become 
president walesa said he then stressed that his signal was 
aimed more at quickening the pace of reforms than putting himself 
into the presidents office 
the slogan in which i say that lech walesa is ready to run for 
president means that he wants to speed up reforms so that the 
reforms are quicker and better not that lech walesa wants to take 
the post of president he said 
walesa added that his remarks to a reporter from the polish 
press agency had been misconstrued 
today on radio and tv i hear that lech walesa agreed to be 
president i didnt say so at all he said i simply did not 
guard my tongue enough somewhere 
the verbal retreat from his declaration of candidacy was vintage 
walesa who typically is circumspect in discussing his political 
moves and often makes seemingly contradictory statements 
for instance he hinted repeatedly in august that he would be 
solidaritys candidate for prime minister a factor that helped 
persuade two smaller parties long allied with the communists to 
support a solidaritydominated government 
in the end walesa handed the union nod to adviser tadeusz 
mazowiecki who became the east blocs first noncommunist prime 
minister 
the fact that walesa intends to run for president of the 
polish republic is not a surprise for me labor party leader 
wladyslaw silanowicki said in todays editions of the newspaper 
rzeczpospolita 
the circles connected with lech walesa have long been 
disclosing such intentions of the solidarity chairman said marek 
jurek a solidarity parliament deputy 
at least one solidarity deputy aleksander malachowski said 
mazowiecki would be a better candidate for president 
the discussion of a presidential bid by walesa comes just days 
before the solidarity labor union is due to hold its first national 
congress in nine years 
walesa has said he is committed to winning reelection as 
solidarity chairman at next weeks congress but he is expected to 
face a challenge from union members who feel solidarity has strayed 
from its original ideals of 1980 by putting politics ahead of 
tradeunion goals such as defending workers interests 
walesa has also found himself in conflict with the mazowiecki 
government which he has accused of acting too slowly in 
privatizing the statedominated economy and removing other remnants 
of the old communist system 
in general solidarity members of parliament and the government 
have been content to move more slowly toward new voting for 
parliament and the presidency 
the main argument for delaying new elections is that for the 
present a nationwide campaign would be too divisive and distract 
energies from the fundamental task of restructuring the economy and 
local governments 
local government elections are scheduled for may 27 and the next 
parliamentary vote is not due until 1993 
those close to walesa have argued for holding elections more 
quickly because of public impatience for political change during a 
time of great economic sacrifice

eight blacks were killed 
including six by police fire in dozens of clashes in black 
townships across the country police said today 
the police unrest report which covered incidents from monday 
night through this morning listed 56 instances of violence 
nationwide all in black areas 
todays unrest report was one of the lengthiest yet since 
violence erupted in black areas two months ago more than 400 
people have died most of them in black factional fighting in the 
southeastern province of natal 
six men died when police said they used combinations of 
shotguns pistols rubber bullets and tear gas at six separate 
locations to disperse mobs or ward off attackers three of the 
police shootings were in natal province two in transvaal province 
and one in cape town 
two blacks were killed by mobs in separate incidents in natal 
police added 
police also said more than 200 people were arrested and dozens 
injured 
many of the incidents involved stonethrowing and the setting 
alight of vehicles private homes and government offices in black 
areas 
some 4000 people have died in the natal fighting since 1986 
the main combatants are supporters of the african national congress 
and inkatha a relatively conservative zulu organization both 
organizations have large numbers of youthful supporters they cannot 
control 
the king edward viii hospital in the port city of durban said it 
was so overcrowded due to the natal fighting that it has 
temporarily stopped admitting patients in need of surgery even 
emergency cases 
we simply cannot carry out any more surgery said the 
hospital superintendent dr am seedat we have reached a 
situation where we cannot take on a single extra patient 
other hospitals in the areas also are at or near capacity due to 
the recent fighting

labor leader shimon peres failed today to 
present a new government to parliament for approval after two 
members of an ultraorthodox religious party defected from his 
coalition at the last minute 
the dramatic turnaround was a major embarrassment for peres who 
only hours before had predicted he would have a 6160 majority in 
the 120seat knesset or parliament and had named his candidates 
for the proposed cabinet 
peres who had vowed to make peace talks with palestinians his 
first priority told president chaim herzog in a letter that he 
would need more time herzog gave him 15 more days to forge a 
coalition 
herzog said in a statement that the recent political 
maneuverings raised piercing questions about our system of 
government and our political culture and that israel eventually 
would have to face these questions 
the wheeling and dealing of forming the government has brought 
loud public complaints that israels electoral system must be 
changed so that small parties are not the controlling factor 
peres bid to form a coalition fell apart when two hardline 
members of the ultraorthodox agudat israel party backed out the 
defectors oppose a government that depends on arab members of the 
parliament for support and they also reject the return of occupied 
land in exchange for peace 
asked about the lastminute defection by the two religious 
lawmakers peres told reporters they can change their minds but 
what pained me was that they did it this morning 
pandemonium broke out in parliament when it became clear that 
peres lacked a majority and lawmakers shouted and wagged fingers 
at each other 
at one point four security guards surrounded a rightwing 
lawmaker who appeared to threaten arab parliament member abdul 
wahab daroushe 
parliament speaker dov shilansky a member of the rightwing 
likud bloc ruled there would be no point in going forward with a 
vote after reading a letter from peres saying labor had failed in 
its attempt to form a government 
shilanksy rejected demands by likud supporters to go ahead with 
the vote which could have further embarrassed peres with a tie or 
a loss 
i do not believe that there is any point in inviting peres to 
the podium to present his government since he announced that it is 
not in his hands shilansky said 
meanwhile israel radio reported efforts were under way to bring 
together another laborlikud coalition in which yitzhak rabin of 
labor and the incumbent yitzhak shamir of likud would each take 
turns being prime minister 
asked about the possibility peres said on israel television 
that he had received a mandate from the party to form a government 
that would give a positive reply to us secretary of state james 
a baker iiis proposals for a palestinianisraeli dialogue 
he said he had asked the agudat israel party if it could still 
guarantee him the backing of all five of its parliament members 
after the two hardliners avraham verdiger and eliezer mizrahi 
announced they would oppose a laborled coalition 
earlier peres declined to tell reporters his plans but said 
i think i have a chance when asked if he could still form a 
government 
labor sources said peres needed an extra two days to give the 
augudat israel party time to replace or bring into line verdiger 
and mizrahi 
verdiger announced his resignation from parliament it would 
take two days for his resignation to take effect after which he 
could be replaced 
mizrahi said that as an act of conscience he would oppose a 
laborled government despite his partys decision to accept peres 
for the peace and safety of the 3 million jews of this 
country i oppose the government mizrahi said 
in this predominantly secular country agudat israel and other 
small religious parties hold disproportionate sway by virtue of the 
split between the countrys two major forces labor and the 
rightwing likud bloc 
in recent days people have staged mass rallies and hunger 
strikes demanding electoral reform such as direct election of the 
prime minister

state treasurer ann richards emerged 
victorious from a mudslinging democratic gubernatorial runoff 
setting up a november election battle that pundits quickly dubbed 
claytie and the lady 
ms richards now faces millionaire oilmanrancher clayton 
williams who cruised to the gop nomination with 61 percent of the 
primary vote march 13 
republican gov bill clements did not seek reelection 
i have seen demolition derbies much like this ms 
richards said of her downanddirty race against attorney general 
jim mattox 
she claimed her victory represented a condemnation of negative 
campaigning by mattox who kept charging that ms richards was 
unfit to govern because of her refusal to say whether she had used 
illegal drugs 
we certainly did put to rest the whole business of the 
mudslinging in this campaign i think the people of texas rejected 
that thats one of the reasons i feel so good about this coming 
november she said 
with 100 percent of the ballots counted ms richards had 
639126 or 57 percent to mattoxs 479384 or 43 percent 
it was mattoxs first election loss since 1966 when he fell 
three votes short in a contest for democratic precinct chairman 
since then he had won elections to the texas house congress and 
two terms as attorney general 
the richardsmattox faceoff was a meanspirited one ms 
richards responded to the drug charges with claims that mattox had 
profited from public service she repeatedly challenged him to 
release his income tax returns 
mattox challenged ms richards a recovering alcoholic to 
release medical records from her alcoholism treatment in 1980 
the last week of the campaign brought newspaper reports that 
mattox was seen smoking marijuana in the mid1970s and that ms 
richards was seen in a restroom where marijuana allegedly was being 
smoked in 1979 both dismissed the reports 
but ms richards and mattox quickly started the kissandmakeup 
process for the fight against williams 
there were other people in this primary who did not support 
our cause and it is time now that we reach out to them and tell 
them that we must be unified ms richards said 
mattox pledged to help ann richards has proven shes a very 
strong candidate proven that she can overcome this drug problem 
he said clayton williams doesnt need to be governor of texas 
williams and the republicans held their own rally tuesday night 
in san antonio he indicated that ms richards refusal to say yes 
or no to questions of ever using illegal drugs wouldnt be an issue 
come fall 
the rehash of the democratic campaign is of no interest to me 
read my lips no more mud said williams who earlier had voiced 
some reluctance about facing a woman i think what well be 
talking about and i hope ann will join me is a real discussion 
of whose philosophy is the best way to win the war on drugs 
ms richards echoed the republicans sentiments 
both clayton williams and i will work very hard to keep this 
an ideological campaign where we really do focus on the issues 
because we do have disagreements on the issues she said 
williams spent more than 8 million 6 million from his own 
pocket in winning the gop nomination 
but ms richards insisted she isnt worried about being outspent 
by a republican ticket that also will include the wellfunded us 
sen phil gramm 
i doubt seriously if we can match him dollarfordollar but i 
dont think the governors mansion is for sale she said in 
the first primary i got 50000 more votes than clayton williams 
and he spent eight times what i did

the request was made by nathan lewin a lawyer appointed to

cable network

therapy session in which she demonstrates with dolls alleged sex 
abuse by her father foretich has denied abusing his daughter 
us district judge stanley sporkin ordered the broadcast not to 
be shown last week but hours later the us circuit court of 
appeals overruled sporkin and allowed the telecast 
the girls mother dr elizabeth morgan sent hilary into hiding 
after a judge here ordered her to allow foretich unsupervised 
visits with the girl 
morgan spent almost two years in jail for refusing to obey the

militant moslem separatists escalated 
their campaign for an independent kashmir killing two more 
hostages in srinagar and bombing a crowded commuter train near 
bombay today police said 
about 1000 troops in battle gear were trucked into srinagar 
the center of the secessionist campaign in the mostly moslem 
northern state bordering pakistan 
the bodies of the two hostages were found late tuesday night 
several hours after the body of another hostage was dumped near a 
srinagar fire station their killings brought to at least 259 the 
number of people killed in kashmir since a government crackdown in 
january 
telephone callers purporting to speak for the mujahedeen 
kashmir or islamic holy warriors of kashmir claimed 
responsibility for the bombing today that injured 34 people near 
the malad station on the outskirts of bombay united news of india 
reported 
later today police said they found five crude bombs hidden in a 
water tank in another bombay suburb it was not immediately known 
whether the discoveries were connected with the train bombing 
the mujahedeen kashmir was first heard of tuesday when it 
claimed responsibility for bomb blasts that injured at least nine 
policemen in two new delhi police stations 
the new delhi and bombay bombings were the first time any 
kashmiri separatists had claimed responsibility for attacks outside 
kashmir since the government of predominantly hindu india launched 
a crackdown on the moslem secessionists jan 20 
police found the bodies of the vice chancellor of kashmir 
university mushir ulhaq and his secretary abdul ghani dumped 
on a road near the citys airport late tuesday the police official 
said 
both men who were moslems had been shot in the back 
earlier tuesday the body of lm khera a hindu industrialist 
was discovered with five bullet wounds 
the dastardly murders are the grossest violations of human 
rights where innocent persons are being made victims of senseless 
externally inspired and motivated violence foreign ministry 
spokesman aftab seth told reporters in new delhi 
all three were kidnapped friday and threatened with execution if 
three top militants were not released they were the first 
civilians not accused of being police informers to be killed by 
militants 
the government had refused to negotiate it imposed an 
aroundtheclock curfew after the kidnappings and detained between 
300 and 400 people it suspected of links with the secessionist 
movement 
the killings triggered an even tighter crackdown on the 
secessionists 
about 100 indian army trucks carrying an estimated 1000 
soldiers were seen moving into srinagar today the state government 
ordered local police and civilians holding curfew passes to stay 
off the streets until further notice said a senior police official

held a demonstration 
we will crush pakistan shouted the demonstrators who were 
prevented from reaching the embassy gate by police 
the group was formed in march to counter the moslem 
jammukashmir liberation front which is leading the secessionist 
campaign 
prime minister vp singh in the most aggressive statement yet 
by an indian leader said tuesday that india should be 
psychologically prepared for an armed conflict with pakistan 
over what he called the islamic nations territorial ambitions in 
the kashmir valley 
singh made the comments in parliament hours after kheras body 
was found he accused pakistan of fomenting the insurgency in the 
northern state of jammukashmir and could make a limited 
intervention 
pakistan will not get away with it singh said you will 
have to pay a very heavy price and we have the capability to 
inflict this cost 
moslemdominated kashmir is a former princely state whose hindu 
ruler opted for union with india in 1947 when the subcontinent was 
divided into hindumajority india and islamic pakistan 
india and pakistan fought wars over the region in 1948 and 1965

the captain of the scandinavian star 
today testified at a maritime inquiry into last weekends ferry 
disaster that he had been awakened by a crewman who told him 
someone is playing arsonist 
capt hugo larsen also rejected allegations by passengers that 
safety was substandard and that his crew of filipino and portuguese 
sailors was unprepared for an emergency 
police in sweden said they have recovered the bodies of 127 
people but up to 200 people may have died when flames engulfed the 
10500ton ship on a voyage from norway to denmark in one of the 
worst recorded fires at sea 
on tuesday a maritime commission from three scandinavian 
countries agreed to crack down on foreignflagged ships and tighten 
safety regulations for all passenger ferries 
larsen said he went to sleep at midnight but was roused by an 
officer at 155 am saturday reporting that woolen blankets were 
burning in a passageway on the port side of the ship 
someone is playing arsonist larsen quoted the officer as 
saying 
shortly afterward another crew member reported smoke in the 
ship and fire patrols discovered fires on both sides of the ship 
almost simultaneously larsen told the inquiry 
the fire spread incredibly fast at the midships section he 
said 
the captain said he had checked safety and fire fighting systems 
and the crew underwent a boat drill before the ships first 
scandinavian voyage on april 1 a fire drill had been planned for 
sunday the day after the fire destroyed the ship he said 
he also rejected charges from passengers who told reporters the 
crewmen could not communicate with them he said most spoke 
usable english and responded well in the crisis 
the inquiry headed by maritime and trade court president frank 
poulsen was expected to hear 15 or 20 witnesses norwegian police 
were heading a separate investigation 
in oslo norwegian police withdrew a decision to release the 
names of 186 people believed dead or missing from the fire on the 
voyage to the danish port frederikshavn 
the list was intended to help clear up the mystery of how many 
people were on board the 20yearold ferry when it caught fire 
but deputy police chief arne huuse said families objected that 
it would appear more like a death list than a list of missing 
required for the investigation 
latest estimates put the number of passengers and crew at 530 
but the figure has changed constantly as bodies were recovered and 
the fate of rescued passengers clarified there were instances 
where people were listed twice said oeystein berger of the oslo 
police 
in the swedish port of lysekil investigators said the work of 
recovering bodies from the firegutted ship was slowing as it 
became harder to collect the remains 
they are mostly ashes sometimes there are two three or four 
people together said police spokesman leif skoglund 
the ferry was towed to lysekil still smoldering on saturday 
evening it took until sunday night to extinguish the fire which 
burned at temperatures reaching 570 degrees consuming everything 
combustible in the midships sections 
at a meeting late tuesday the maritime directors of sweden 
norway and denmark approved tighter measures to inspect ships 
flying foreign flags of convenience in nordic waters 
about 60 million passengers travel nordic routes every year 
more than three times the total populations of the three countries 
twelve ships including the nassauregistered scandinavian star 
fly foreign flags 
the commission decided that the foreignflagged ships should 
undergo safety checks by a nordic maritime authority said a 
statement released by the danish maritime board 
until now primary responsibility for safety standards has been 
with the registering country and foreignflagged ships were 
subjected to spot checks 
the statement said crews must demonstrate fire fighting 
qualifications and training for emergency evacuations the group 
also decided to require complete passenger lists on ferries 
traveling at night it said

for a third consecutive year wisconsin 
adults weighed in as the most obese in a national survey probably 
due to a diet heavy in the states bestknown products cheese 
butter and bratwurst a researcher says 
wisconsin has consistently had the highest percentage of obese 
adults among the 37 states surveyed over the past three years 
said dr patrick remington author of a study released tuesday by 
the state division of health 
one million wisconsin adults or about 28 percent of the adult 
population are at least 20 percent overweight the study said 
women are more likely to be overweight than men 
obesity was defined as 20 percent or more above desirable body 
weight remington said 
wisconsin nicknamed americas dairyland was followed by west 
virginia indiana michigan and north dakota 
states with the highest prevalence of obesity tended to be in 
the upper midwest remington said 
i think that in the upper midwest we probably have a higher 
intake of dietary fat cheese butter ice cream bacon sausages 
bratwursts 
another factor could be the high percentage of germanic and 
northern europeans in our population and their greater tendency 
to be obese he said 
if both your parents were obese you have an 80 percent chance 
of being obese he said if neither was obese your chances are 
only 18 percent 
the 1988 behavior risk factor telephone survey found 303 
percent of adult women were obese compared with 255 percent of 
adult men remington said 
for example a man who is 5 feet 10 inches tall and weighs more 
than 193 pounds would be obese a woman who is 5feet4 and weighs 
mmore than 158 pounds would be obese he said 
remington said the prevalence of obesity generally increased 
with age for women peaking in the 4554 age group and remaining 
high among older ages 
for men however the risk of obesity declined among those in 
the older age groups he said 
remington said the telephone survey in wisconsin involved 1272 
telephone contacts the survey was coordinated through the us 
centers for disease control which provided identical 
questionnaires to the states and recommended 1200 to 1800 survey 
contacts in each state he said 
the study contained the following percentages on overweight 
adults for the top 20 states 
wisconsin 28 percent of adults obese west virginia 244 
percent indiana 241 percent michigan 24 percent north dakota 
233 percent district of columbia 23 percent kentucky 23

the french government responded to mounting 
criticism today by insisting it had not dealt with terrorists in 
negotiating the release of a french woman her belgian companion 
and their child 
the three were released in lebanon by abu nidals libyanbacked 
palestinian terrorist group on tuesday after 2 years in captivity 
and flown to france spending the night at a military hospital 
outside paris 
foreign minister roland dumas said negotiations for the release 
of the three who were believed to have been held in libya were on 
the level of state to state he said france did not speak 
with the abductors 
those who criticized the governments praise for libyan leader 
col moammar gadhafi for helping to free the three were being 
picky he said 
gadhafi has backed abu nidal who along with some of his 
followers has been convicted of terrorist attacks abroad 
reportedly allowing him to live near the libyan capital of tripoli 
there have also been reports however that the libyans have 
restricted the movements of abu nidal and his lieutenants 
in an editorial today the conservative newspaper le figaro 
branded gadhafi the real abductor of the newly freed hostages 
paul wilkinson director of the research institute for the study 
of conflict and terrorism said the hostage release proves an 
ongoing link between gadhafi and abu nidal 
the public should be warned against euphoria over the latest 
hostage release in lebanon wilkinson said in london it was 
obtained by a deal which violates the european community policy of 
no concessions under duress to terrorists or their sponsors 
a month ago france returned to libya three frenchmade mirage 
jet fighters that had been in france for repairs since 1986 libya 
pressing for delivery of the aircraft closed its ports to french 
ships in december 
in its editorial le figaro said one imagines that the 
thankyous addressed by roland dumas to col gadhafi were part of a 
deal which permitted the end of three years of imprisonment 
we have been working on this case for months dumas told 
reporters late tuesday after the hostages arrival we alerted a 
large number of countries particularly libya our discussions were 
only state to state with respect for the principles which are 
ours 
previous releases of french hostages by proiranian lebanese 
groups prompted charges that france barters with terrorists claims 
france has denied 
state department officials in washington welcomed the release 
but were critical of frances warm words for gadhafi 
such rhetoric is nauseating the british newspaper the 
independent wrote in an editorial criticizing france 
president francois mitterrand had personally thanked gadhafi for 
his determining role in the releases and dumas declared that 
tense frenchlibyan relations would now improve 
france is being nicer to libya than we think they should be 
said one of the state department officials who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
the us officials said france and other countries should press 
libya to expel the group and stop alleged efforts to make chemical 
weapons 
jacqueline valente 32 fernand houtekins 43 and their 
2yearold daughter sophieliberte made no public statements upon 
their arrival refusing to discuss conditions of their captivity or 
where they were held they were taken to a military hospital and 
all appeared healthy 
the three had been dropped off at the french embassy in beirut 
tuesday morning by masked gunmen in cars with drawn curtains 
ms valente and houtekins were seized in november 1987 from a 
french yacht off the gaza strip and the abu nidal group accused 
them of collaborating with israeli intelligence friends said they 
were on a holiday cruise 
their release leaves four belgians abducted with them 
houtekins brother emmanuel and his family still held hostage 
two other daughters of ms valente were freed as a result of libyan 
intervention on dec 29 1988 
dumas told reporters that french and belgian authorities 
remained in contact for the release of the four 
nidals group linked freedom for them to the release of nasser 
saeed a palestinian serving a life term in belgium for a june 
1980 grenade attack on jewish youths in antwerp 
the belgian government has not responded to the offer 
because the hostages were believed to have been held in libya 
the case is considered unrelated to the 18 westerners including 
eight americans held in lebanon by proiranian shiite moslem 
factions 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
gadhafi said tuesday that the abu nidal group was distancing 
itself from its terrorist reputation by releasing the hostages 
libyas official news agency jana reported 
the group has been blamed for scores of terrorist acts 
including the december 1985 attacks on rome and vienna airports 
that killed more than 20 people

it should be orbiting 380 miles high 
today and looking at the heavens but instead the 15 billion 
hubble space telescope rests inside space shuttle discovery 
shielded from earthly dust and debris 
the shuttles launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff 
tuesday because of a malfunctioning power unit and nasa said the 
mission will be attempted again in a week or two the space agency 
needs the time to replace the unit and recharge the telescopes 
batteries 
we are certainly concerned about contamination every day that 
were here on earth and we will do everything we have done in the 
past to assure that we take care of any problem like that said 
fred wojtalik a nasa project manager 
hubble has a 94inch mirror that is the finest ever made and 
even a speck of dust would impair its efficiency 
the delay was the latest of many for hubble nasas most 
expensive and complex payload the telescope originally was 
scheduled to take its place in space in 1983 but technical 
problems and the 1986 challenger explosion interfered 
wojtalik said the national aeronautics and space administration 
had not decided whether to charge the telescopes nickelhydrogen 
batteries while they are inside the orbiter or at a laboratory 
discoverys commander loren j shriver said before heading 
back to johnson space center in houston today that he and the other 
four astronauts are disappointed just like everybody else 
thats kind of the name of the game he said we go when 
the equipment is ready to go and were always ready to go 
the hundreds of astronomers gathered at kennedy space center for 
the launch also went home disappointed 
we came in and it was bad weather so we had very low 
expectations then the weather cleared up and it was beautiful and 
all our spirits went up with it said francesco paresce a 
scientist with the european space agency 
until four minutes everything was fine and gorgeous then 
bang back down to depression so its been a swing which is really 
incredible he said 
the countdown had moved uninterrupted to the fourminute mark 
when sensors detected that one of three auxiliary power units was 
running too fast computers halted the launch process 
we dont like to find problems late in the launch count 
said launch director bob sieck however when we have problems 
we do like to find them on the ground and that part of the system 
worked 
the auxiliary power units pressurize the shuttles hydraulic 
system which is used to move wing and rudder surfaces and in the 
ships braking and steering systems nasa forbids a liftoff unless 
all three units operate properly 
nasa will have to remove the 100pound unit from discovery while 
the shuttle is in an upright position something the space agency 
has never done before auxiliary power units have caused 
postponements of shuttle launches twice previously but the work 
was performed before the shuttle reached the launch pad 
tuesdays scrub cost nasa 377000 in fuel and 247000 in labor 
and materials that excludes the cost of other nasa centers 
supporting the mission 
the delay irksome though it was to many didnt bother john 
holtzman of the lowell observatory at flagstaff ariz 
the universe has been around for a long time he said it 
will stay around for a couple more days

portland maine press herald on poindexter 
like oliver north before him former national security adviser 
john poindexter has been convicted of criminal charges growing out 
of the reagan administrations irancontra scandal 
so why care president reagans watch has ended a free 
election has been held in nicaragua the ayatollah khomeini is 
dead poindexters and norths military careers have been ruined 
true american hostages remain prisoners but why not let the 
scandal rest 
because in the name of patriotism poindexter and north rode 
roughshod over our concept of government as one of laws not men 
they established a shadow government in the national security 
council that cavalierly made and carried out secret foreign policy 
in the process they broke the laws they were pledged to protect 
thats worth remembering

burlington county times willingboro nj on abortion and 
politics 
it doesnt matter how you stand on abortion or even if you 
elect to avoid the argument altogether theres one aspect of the 
issue that bids to do you harm 
thats todays tendency to put all the eggs in one political 
basket to vote for or against a candidate strictly on how he or 
she stands on abortion at least one organization actually targeted 
new jersey candidates for defeat at the polls if they did not 
measure up to the organizations stand on abortion 
the national organization for women actually tried to boycott an 
entire state idaho and a defenseless vegetable the potato 
though the state legislature passed a restrictive abortion 
measure there idahos gov cecil andrus perhaps fearing for the 
fiscal health of his fiefdom reversed the process with a 
lastminute veto 
we oppose the notion that candidate should be thrown out of 
office or thrown in for that matter just because of a stand on 
one issue 
the abortion issue is an emotional one but it has a direct 
effect on only a small percentage of marchers on either side 
including those who fail for one reason or another to use readily 
available preventive measures 
our political system is often perceived as corrupt but there is 
little excuse for our corrupting it deliberately

the pressenterprise riverside calif on foreign cars 
the battered american automobile industry received another blow 
from its foreign competitors last year when the honda accord became 
the bestselling car in the united states 
the accord is about to set another precedent in the continuing 
transformation of the american automobile market the 1991 models 
turned out at hondas marysville ohio plant may be officially 
designated american cars by the federal government 
the environmental protection agency which monitors the content 
and fuel efficiency of all cars sold in the us conveys that 
designation on vehicles that have more than 75 percent american 
content the parts and labor used to build them 
the japanese cars bought by american consumers are increasingly 
built by americans often with predominantly americanmade parts 
hondas plants in ohio for example turn out virtually all of the 
honda civic models sold here and most of the accords 
during the past three years japanese auto makers have opened 
eight manufacturing plants in the united states the same number 
that the american big three has closed during that period many of 
those displaced americans now work for toyota nissan and honda 
the newest immigrants 
americans with a true preference for foreign cars might have to 
go back to those european models

the providence ri journalbulletin on general motors robert 
stempel 
lets hope that whats good for general motors robert stempel 
will be good for the country 
stempel has just been chosen as the new chairman and chief 
executive of gm the largest us corporation his selection may 
suggest something of a change in the attitudes of american big 
business stempel currently the companys president is an 
engineer and to use automobile industry jargon a product 
guy 
most previous leaders of the giant company including the 
departing roger smith have come from the financial side 
stempels appointment may suggest that american business is 
giving new emphasis to engineering and product development and 
less to financial redeployments and other maneuverings such a 
change would be healthy 
further the selection of a man with stempels substantial 
foreign experience may indicate a heightened corporate appreciation 
of the need to succeed in the world marketplace where the great 
growth of the future is likely to come 
the appointment of robert stempel to lead general motors may 
suggest that american industry is now giving more attention to 
these essential elements of corporate and national success

argus leader sioux falls sd on south africa 
after decades of injustice there are signs that south africas 
racist system of apartheid might crumble but recent advances have 
stalled 
the united states should increase the pressure on south africa 
to help keep progress coming 
tougher us sanctions would give south africas black leaders a 
stronger bargaining chip in upcoming talks with the white 
government 
tougher sanctions also would give south african president fw 
de klerk the opportunity if he chooses to blame the united states 
for the need for more changes 
us sanctions have helped prod south africa slowly toward a 
just society its time to step up the pace

roswell nm daily record on immigration reform and 
discrimination 
comprehensive immigration reform was designed to curtail illegal 
immigration it is not a license to discriminate against 
mexicanamericans or legal aliens or americans who look or sound 
foreign 
apparently however discrimination has been the unintended 
result according to a recent report by the general accounting 
office the immigration reform and control act has indeed produced 
a widespread pattern of discrimination some are having trouble 
finding work because employers fear the consequences of the law 
congress now must respond under the 1986 law a finding of 
widespread discrimination requires lawmakers to reconsider 
employer sanctions within the next 30 days repealing sanctions is 
an option although less extreme options are available and at 
this point preferable 
illegal immigration continues to be a problem particularly 
along the usmexico border area immigration reform was a 
goodfaith effort to respond now that effort needs to be 
calibrated the law cannot be an excuse to discriminate

congress allocated 3 million to study economic conditions in 
impoverished regions of seven states bordering the mississippi 
river mississippi louisiana arkansas tennessee kentucky 
missouri and illinois the study is to be concluded with a 10year 
plan for economic development 
even as the report is being finalized preliminary information 
is circulating among those recently submitting data were 
sociologists forrest a deseran and joachim singlemann of louisiana 
state university their principal conclusion was that the delta 
region stands apart from the mainstream and if it is to 
become competitive in the national economy it needs help now 
to facilitate their study the researchers divided the 214county 
area into 27 labor markets they found that the top third of the 
labor markets compared favorably to national averages unemployment 
rates and poverty evident in the bottom twothirds however show 
the extent of the task at hand 
in those 18 labor markets the average unemployment rate is 36 
percent higher than the national average their per capita income 
is less than 75 percent of the us total and their families are 
more than twice as likely to be poor as the average american

red wing minn republican eagle on americas appetite for oil 
joseph hazelwood will be doing his time cleaning up the 
oilsoaked shoreline as payment for his role in misguiding the 
exxon valdez 
the fiasco of the exxon valdez however is one tiny piece of a 
much bigger issue thats the gluttony of americans when it comes 
to cheap energy 
the overconsumption of oil places more pressure on our domestic 
sources that in turn steps up the intensity to rely solely on such 
deposits as those along alaskas north shore the tragedy of the 
exxon valdez taught us all a bitter and longlasting lesson it 
rightfully has spurred congress to pursue tougher sanctions such as 
mandatory doublehulling of ships to prevent future disasters 
in the short term the valdez incident emphasizes the need for 
the industry to hire competent employees and to operate under 
stricter standards in the long run america must reduce its 
appetite for energy if its to lessen the pressure to take the type 
of shortcuts which permitted the tragic accident in alaska

delivering verbal haymakers to the solar plexus of the federally 
subsidized arts last week the southwest missourian urged a 
congressional panel to halt the federal government from bankrolling 
the national endowment for the arts 
he disparaged the nea as just another wasteful bureaucracy in 
many cases an obscene waste he complained that federal money had 
gone to the arts that he described as obscene indecent 
sacrilegious and racist which are offensive to the vast majority 
of our nations taxpayers 
it has been said that a culture defines itself by the limits it 
sets for its people we sense that either severe constraints are 
coming down the pike for the national endowment for the arts or 
abolishment of the agency the latter is preferred

shawano wis evening leader on college basketball 
march madness lived up to its name this season with the college 
basketball tournament more competitive than it has ever been but 
while the game itself couldnt be healthier there are still many 
problems with a sport that puts such a high price on winning 
college presidents talk of running clean programs with an 
emphasis on players who graduate then they turn around and fire 
coaches who do both of those things why because their teams dont 
win more often 
the system that is still being used amounts to nothing more than 
a tremendous incentive to cheat currently each of the 64 schools 
selected for the ncaa tournament receives upwards of 250000 with 
each ensuing tournament victory worth an additional 250000 
schools that advance to the final four are raking in over 1 
million 
unless the system is changed those numbers are only going to 
increase next year when the ncaa enters into a sevenyear 1 
billion tv contract with cbs in effect tripling the money from the 
last contract 
the tournaments growing popularity has nothing to do with the 
money involved it would be followed just as closely if the players 
were playing strictly for a championship trophy and not some 
milliondollar check for their school besides there is something 
inherently wrong about unpaid amateur athletes earning enormous 
sums of money for an institution 
by simply distributing the 1 billion among all 291 division i 
schools and eliminating the huge financial rewards given to winning 
teams some of the pressures on coaches and athletes would be 
removed

american businesses plan to increase spending 
on plant and equipment by a healthy 76 percent this year the 
government said today in a report reflecting renewed optimism about 
the economy 
the commerce department said a survey completed in march found 
businesses planning to spend 5034 billion for expansion and 
modernization this year 
if realized that would surpass the previous record of 4678 
billion in capital spending set last year 
this year would mark the fourth consecutive increase in 
investment however the rate of growth would be the slowest in 
three years capital spending rose 86 percent in 1989 89 percent 
in 1988 and 42 percent in 1987 
the new estimate for capital spending growth in 1990 is only 
slightly below last years rise and represents a substantial 
increase from an earlier survey of 1990 plans released in december 
at that time businesses said they planned to boost spending by 
only 49 percent 
all of the figures have been adjusted for inflation 
the earlier survey occurred when many economists were predicting 
a recession this year since then the economy has proved more 
resilient than expected and as a consequence companies have planned 
for expansion more optimistically 
the projected increase in spending would be good news for the 
economy providing needed momentum this year at a time when the 
stimulus from a shrinking trade deficit is fading 
economists say the increased productivity that results from 
investment spending is the only way in the long run to bolster 
economic growth the federal reserve board has been keeping 
interest rates relatively high in an attempt to keep the economy 
from overheating and fueling inflation 
the 76 percent investment increase for all industries includes 
a 46 percent rise in manufacturing and a 95 percent increase for 
companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing areas 
manufacturing and housing have been the sectors of the economy 
hardest hit by the feds tight money policy 
manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of 
1902 billion the anticipated rate of increase although lower

goods and a 66 percent increase for nondurables durable goods 
are big ticket items expected to last three or more years

lets hope that whats good for general motors robert stempel 
will be good for the country 
stempel has just been chosen as the new chairman and chief 
executive of gm the largest us corporation his selection may 
suggest something of a change in the attitudes of american big 
business stempel currently the companys president is an 
engineer and to use automobile industry jargon a product 
guy 
most previous leaders of the giant company including the 
departing roger smith have come from the financial side 
stempels appointment may suggest that american business is 
giving new emphasis to engineering and product development and 
less to financial redeployments and other maneuverings such a 
change would be healthy 
further the selection of a man with stempels substantial 
foreign experience may indicate a heightened corporate appreciation 
of the need to succeed in the world marketplace where the great 
growth of the future is likely to come 
the appointment of robert stempel to lead general motors may 
suggest that american industry is now giving more attention to 
these essential elements of corporate and national success

tougher us sanctions would give south africas black leaders a 
stronger bargaining chip in upcoming talks with the white

tougher sanctions also would give south african president fw

roswell nm daily record on immigration reform and 
discrimination 
comprehensive immigration reform was designed to curtail illegal 
immigration it is not a license to discriminate against 
mexicanamericans or legal aliens or americans who look or sound 
foreign 
apparently however discrimination has been the unintended 
result according to a recent report by the general accounting 
office the immigration reform and control act has indeed produced 
a widespread pattern of discrimination some are having trouble 
finding work because employers fear the consequences of the law 
congress now must respond under the 1986 law a finding of 
widespread discrimination requires lawmakers to reconsider 
employer sanctions within the next 30 days repealing sanctions is 
an option although less extreme options are available and at 
this point preferable 
illegal immigration continues to be a problem particularly 
along the usmexico border area immigration reform was a 
goodfaith effort to respond now that effort needs to be 
calibrated the law cannot be an excuse to discriminate

plan for economic development 
even as the report is being finalized preliminary information 
is circulating among those recently submitting data were 
sociologists forrest a deseran and joachim singlemann of louisiana 
state university their principal conclusion was that the delta 
region stands apart from the mainstream and if it is to 
become competitive in the national economy it needs help now 
to facilitate their study the researchers divided the 214county 
area into 27 labor markets they found that the top third of the 
labor markets compared favorably to national averages unemployment 
rates and poverty evident in the bottom twothirds however show 
the extent of the task at hand 
in those 18 labor markets the average unemployment rate is 36 
percent higher than the national average their per capita income 
is less than 75 percent of the us total and their families are 
more than twice as likely to be poor as the average american

an atlase rocket 
roared toward space today carrying three small scientific 
satellites on a 22 million mission aimed at improving military 
communications and aiding navigation 
the 96foot rocket lifted off the pad at space launch complex3 
at 8 am said maj tom worsdale an air force spokesman at this 
sprawling coastal military base 140 miles northwest of los angeles 
it looked excellent he said its the smoothest launch 
ive seen in the year ive been here everything went perfect 
worsdale said the rocket flew south over the pacific ocean and 
the satellites weighing from 120 to 150 pounds each went into 
orbit at 815 am 
the three satellites containing four experiments were 
propelled toward a 460mile polar orbit by the atlas which was 
topped by a scoutaltair upper stage booster 
the mission was named p872 stacksat the air force hasnt 
explained the meaning of p872 but stacksat means the satellites 
were stacked atop the rocket for launch 
the atlas similar to the one that lifted john glenn to the 
first manned orbit of earth in 1962 was built by general dynamics 
and once served as a nuclear warheadtipped intercontinental 
ballistic missile at forbes air force base in kansas it was 
refurbished in 1987 for use in launching payloads into space 
the instruments on the three research satellites will help make 
navigation charts and test ways to overcome phenomena in earths 
atmosphere that can interfere with military and other 
communications 
the devices will be turned on in about 30 days and operate for 
at least a year capt mark goodman project manager said in a 
statement issued before the launch 
the uppermost satellite named polar orbiting geomagnetic 
survey contains two experiments the first is a magnetometer that 
will measure the strength of the earths magnetic field at various 
locations the data will be used to help construct new defense 
mapping agency geomagnetic charts which are updated every five 
years as the magnetic field changes 
the satellite also contains the solid state recorder experiment 
meant to demonstrate the use of highspeed integrated circuit 
designs as computer memory devices in space said ed parsons chief 
spokesman for the air forces space systems division in los angeles 
the second satellite named tex or transceiver experiment will 
study communications problems by bouncing radio waves off the 
ionosphere the part of earths atmosphere rich with electrically 
charged particles 
the third satellite the selective communications experiment 
carries a variablepower radio transmitter that will also bounce 
radio waves of varying frequencies off the ionosphere for similar

it was more than half a century ago 
but ruth harris davidson still remembers the day she held hands 
with bank robber john dillinger 
the desperado and an accomplice had just robbed the national 
bank of fostoria of 17000 shot seven people and was speeding 
out of town with mrs davidson balanced precariously on the running 
board of the careening getaway car 
the robbery occurred may 3 1934 during one of dillingers 
midwestern crime sprees since then mrs davidson then a teller at 
the bank has lived what she terms a quiet life but events of 
that day still bring a sparkle to her eyes 
she chuckled on learning recently that the warner bros movie 
studio is scouting northwest ohio for a place to film a movie about 
dillinger she lives in bowling green about 20 miles northwest of 
fostoria 
mrs davidson 78 recalled her suprise at the suddenness of the 
holdup by dillinger and homer van meter and the whirlwind pace of 
her kidnapping 
they came in and both were wearing long coats she said 
one of them i cant remember which shouted everybody out of 
the cages i thought it was a joke until they brought out the 
machine guns from under the coats 
employees were lined up across the glass entrance to shield the 
holdup men from police gunfire from outside dillinger ordered bank 
president andrew emerine to open the vault 
when he took a little too long to get the keys van meter 
shredded the glass partition between the cages and vault with his 
machine gun and they went in mrs davidson said then they 
came out and cleaned the money out of the tellers cages i can 
remember just standing there shivering 
when the bandits fled mrs davidson said van meter grabbed 
me and held me in front of him they also took another employee 
as a hostage 
i can only remember saying ill do anything i just want to 
go home to my mother 
they made the hostages stand on the running boards of the car to 
keep police from shooting as they sped away 
we thought we were going to fall off or the car would tip over 
we had to scoot down against the wind and dillinger held onto my 
hand the whole time mrs davidson said 
two miles out of town the bandits slowed down thanked their 
hostages politely and told them to jump they then drove away 
it was a long time before i wasnt afraid of something 
happening she said i didnt follow dillingers career after 
that but i still feel that mans arm around me once in a 
while 
dillinger was killed by police in chicago two months later

the nations businesses shrugging off 
economists gloomy recession predictions have significantly 
increased their plans for modernization and expansion this year 
the government said wednesday 
the commerce department said a survey completed in march found 
businesses planning a record 5034 billion in plant and equipment 
spending in 1990 up 76 percent from last year 
businesses had projected a much less optimistic 49 percent rise 
in an earlier survey released in december when many analysts were 
forecasting the imminent end of the economys sevenyear expansion 
the significance of this is its one more piece of evidence 
were not going into a recession said economist gordon richards 
of the national association of manufacturers capital spending 
will be providing some strength to an otherwise weak 
economy 
if the new projections are realized spending would surpass the 
previous record of 4678 billion set last year and would mark the 
fourth consecutive increase capital spending rose 86 percent in 
1989 89 percent in 1988 and 42 percent in 1987 
all the figures have been adjusted for inflation 
the surprisingly strong investment plans come at a time of 
generally sluggish economic growth and declining corporate profits 
most analysts are forecasting growth as measured by the gross 
national product of around 2 percent this year down from 3 
percent last year 
the survey indicates businesses appear to be looking beyond the 
slowdown and are making the improvements they need to ensure 
increased productivity and better profits in the future economists 
said 
despite all the stories of gloom and doom you read this 
shows that businesses are not as shortsighted as many say 
said economist stephen s roach of morgan stanley amp co 
over time capital spending not only will bolster economic 
growth it will increase profits and ease inflation he said 
the current profit squeeze is being caused by companies 
inability to pass on higher costs to their customers modernization 
spending should help eliminate the production bottlenecks that are 
driving up those costs he said 
the report should be received as good news at the federal 
reserve which has been using relatively high interest rates to 
dampen economic growth and prevent demand from swapping production 
capacity and adding to inflation pressures 
the feds wish list is probably not so much an economic 
slowdown but a shift from consumer spending to savings and 
investment roach said 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch said capital spending 
plans are weakest in businesses most affected by lackluster 
domestic demand for big ticket durable goods such as autos 
and strongest in sectors supported by strong overseas demand such 
as paper aircraft and nonelectrical machinery 
the 76 percent planned investment increase for all industries 
includes a 46 percent rise in manufacturing and a 95 percent 
increase for companies engaged in mining transportation and other 
nonmanufacturing areas 
manufacturers are projecting investment spending this year of 
1902 billion the anticipated rate of increase although lower 
than the average for all industries was still sharply up from the 
14 percent projection in december 
the manufacturing gain includes a 22 percent rise in durable 
goods and a 66 percent increase for nondurables durable goods 
are items expected to last three or more years everything from 
washing machines to warships because buyers usually borrow to 
purchase durable goods those sales are more easily depressed by 
high interest rates 
in the december survey durablegoods manufacturers had 
projected a 15 percent drop in investment spending 
before adjusting for inflation the department predicted a 78 
percent increase for all businesses this year to 5128 billion 
after rising 104 percent last year that was up from the earlier 
1990 forecast of 64 percent

leaders of balticamerican groups urged 
president bush today to take steps toward recognizing lithuanias 
declaration of independence from the soviet union but were unable 
to persuade him to take that step 
our policy we believe is the correct one and it does not 
involve recognition white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said afterwards 
the president did not change his views but was impressed with 
the strength and depth of their convictions fitzwater said 
emerging from the meeting anthony mazeika of the baltic 
american freedom league said we are disappointed with the 
official policy of the united states by not extending recognition 
to president vytautas landsbergis government 
even so the balticamerican leaders said they were pleased to 
have had an audience with bush as last after being turned down for 
meetings earlier 
we have a lot of very good contacts on the lower and 
midlevels of the state department its just the white house we 
havent been able to penetrate we used to wear out the threshold 
of the previous administration said mariann rikken chairman of 
the joint baltic american national committee 
bush and secretary of state james a baker iii spent more than 
an hour with americans representing the interests of lithuania 
latvia and estonia the three baltic states annexed by the soviet 
union in 1940 
mazeika said they pressed bush and baker to grant de facto 
recognition of the landsbergis government as an intermediate step 
toward full diplomatic ties 
asked if bush left the impression he was sympathetic to that 
idea ms rikken said no we dont have that feel but te fact 
that he met with us the fact that i think we made an impression 
that this is not some sort of an emotional appeal i think that 
had an impact 
mazeika said that bush expressed sympathy for their cause but 
said he has to consider the other agendas as well as his feeling 
that there must be a way to support soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs overall efforts for democratic reform 
bush said tuesday that gorbachevs tolerance of democratic 
freedoms in warsaw pact nations had demonstrated a commitment to 
reform and openness thats remarkable 
so give him credit and deal openly with him on problems such 
as lithuania the president said but when you have difficulties 
like we have today talk frankly with him about it 
bushs twinedged message of praise and restraint appeared 
intended to put pressure on gorbachev not to use force or 
additional intimidation against lithuania to abandon its 
declaration of independence 
bush on a visit to toronto said no one could have predicted 
gorbachevs willingness to accept changes in eastern europe 
in other words he has demonstrated that he is committed to 
peaceful change and the evolution of democracy he said 
mulroney was the first of three western leaders holding talks 
with bush over a 10day period bush will see british prime 
minister margaret thatcher in bermuda on friday and confer with 
french president francois mitterrand in key largo fla on april 
19 
the chief topics of bushs talks with mulroney were the tensions 
in lithuania and the presidents fiveday summit with gorbachev 
beginning may 30 
bush said that if the situation in lithuania deteriorates it 
would be extraordinarily difficult to move forward as rapidly as 
id like to see us move forward with them on a lot of questions 
he said the presence of soviet tanks in lithuania make it even 
more important to have goodfaith negotiations over the fate of 
the republic 
i would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence 
to encourage dialogue and discussion he said

irish prime minister charles 
haughey brought a message of economic unity to northern ireland on 
wednesday but protestant demonstrators shouted support for the 
islands political division 
haughey haughey out out out demonstrators cried 
haughey chairman of the european communitys council of 
ministers told a conference on crossborder trade that economic 
forces will inevitably interlink the economies of both parts of 
ireland 
as the technical and fiscal borders disappear and both 
economies will converge it will make simple common sense for us to 
combine in facing the problems and opportunities that the situation 
will present equally to us both haughey said these are the 
economic realities of the future 
the overwhelmingly roman catholic republic of ireland has been 
separated from protestantdominated northern ireland since 1922 
when ireland gained independence from britain irelands 
constitution lays claim to the whole island and northern ireland 
has been torn by conflict between advocates of irish unity and 
those loyal to britain 
reg empey the lord mayor of belfast and a protestant spoke to 
the conference before haughey and denounced irelands claim on the 
province 
about 300 protestants gathered outside the europa hotel before 
haugheys speech they were kept under control by a large security 
operation mounted by the royal ulster constabulary northern 
irelands police force 
haughey is here to dance on the graves of the provinces 
bereaved the rev ian paisley told reporters outside the hotel 
paisley leader of the democratic unionist party referred to 
the slaying of four members of the ulster defense regiment they 
were killed monday by an irish republican army bomb irelands 
foreign minister gerry collins earlier this year had called for 
the heavily protestant unit to be disbanded 
haughey repeatedly stressed the two parts of ireland should 
cooperate within the 12nation european community haughey 
currently speaks on behalf of the bloc its presidency rotates 
every six months 
our economic and social characteristics which are shared by 
both parts of ireland would benefit if a combined approach could 
be established haughey told the conference which was organized 
by the institute of directors 
we have a clear mutual interest in strengthening community 
policies for the less developed regions it makes sense for both 
parts of the island to cooperate and share the costs in developing 
strategy 
earlier as he was ushered quickly past the demonstrators into 
the hotel haughey was asked whether he worried about his personal 
security while in belfast 
not particularly he said i know the ruc royal ulster 
constabulary will make every effort to look after me 
a frontpage cartoon in the irish times of dublin on wednesday 
taunted haughey for his past criticism of british rule in northern 
ireland the cartoon showed haughey surrounded by ruc men with the 
prime minister saying still a police state thank goodness 
irish leaders have rarely visited northern ireland since 
sectarian and political fighting flared in 1969 
haugheys predecessor garret fitzgerald was in the province in 
november 1985 to sign the angloirish agreement with mrs thatcher 
the accord deeply disliked by protestants gives dublin a formal 
consultative role in northern irelands affairs and pledges the two 
governments to cooperate against terrorism

dont laugh now unless youre feeling achy 
but the town doctor of motala sweden says his research among the 
dour folks of his community shows that humor can relieve pain 
there was a linear relationship between the degree of fun and 
the level of symptoms dr lars ljungdahl medical director of 
the motala primary healthcare center told a news conference 
wednesday reporting on his laugh therapy research 
ljungdahl 40 a fan of peter sellers and the cosby show is 
in the united states for a conference on humor and to consult with 
medical researchers to bolster his theory that laughter suppresses 
the hormones that cause stress and thus helps people with chronic 
pain 
he described his research with six motala women suffering from 
muscularskeletal disorders and depressive moods 
the patients met at his clinic weekly for 13 weeks used funny 
books records and videos ljungdahl reported in a letter to the 
journal of the american medical association that the women 
learned to give higher priority to humor in our everyday lives 
for homework they kept notebooks of funny things observed 
ranking them on a onetofive scale from hardly a grin to 
laughed heartily 
the result the pain didnt vanish but the patients quality of 
life improved 
they still meet occasionally to joke around 
we felt better ourselves for having met with this group the 
doctor said i think i have become a little funnier myself you 
tell your patients that you are the doctor treating patients with 
humor and they begin to laugh immediately 
ljungdahl said his findings complement those of norman cousins 
author of two bestselling books on how ones outlook can affect 
recovery from lifethreatening illnesses 
the humor perspective is a way of thinking ljungdahl said 
a way of getting distance from your problems 
he said he isnt ready to claim that humor actually cures 
disease but there are indications pointing in that direction we 
know that laughter enhances the immune system 
he rejects smutty or ethnic jokes in his therapy jokes are 
fine he says but the humorous events of everyday life are better 
medicine 
pressed for an example he told of a friend delivering a speech 
in poland 
the friend wanted to open by saying ladies and gentlemen in 
polish but forgot those words so he noted what appeared on the 
doors of the mens and ladies restrooms when he spoke the 
audience roared 
the speaker had said ladies and urinals 
every person has a sense of humor ljungdahl said every 
child laughs it is not so much learning something new but 
regaining what you once had 
if the people of motala can respond to laugh therapy he said 
people anywhere can motala people have a reputation for 
complaining he said 
it is he said with a thin smile swedens whine

tshirts or teddy bears inscribed with the 
message of a political or religious group have the same 
constitutional protection as books a federal appeals court ruled 
in a 30 decision the 9th us circuit court of appeals said 
san francisco cant prohibit nonprofit groups from selling items 
that convey core first amendment messages such as political or 
philosophical statements 
the city also cant require those groups to get a permit issued 
at the sole discretion of the police chief to sell messagebearing 
merchandise the court said tuesday the decision the first on the 
issue by any federal appeals court upholds a 1988 lowercourt 
ruling 
its nice that the first amendment still seems to survive 
said robert moest lawyer for five religious and political groups 
that challenged the san francisco ordinance he said the items 
served an important political function 
since the vietnam war people have tended to wear tshirts 
conveying their beliefs moest said organizations sell them to 
raise funds for their cause its a great way to communicate a 
message 
the city will appeal the ruling said deputy city attorney burk 
delventhal 
we have a longstanding policy of the city that sidewalks shall 
not be used by merchants in competition with businesses who 
rent space and pay taxes the nonprofit vendors he said are 
masquerading under the guise of the first amendment 
delventhal also said the appeals courts standard protecting 
sales of items that were inextricably intertwined with a 
political or other noncommercial message was vague and 
unworkable how would it apply he asked to the common practice of 
selling a tshirt showing a san francisco scene with the name of a 
religious group in fine print 
the ordinance which originally applied only to the fishermans 
wharf and union square tourist areas and was later made citywide 
was backed by shop owners who complained that their prices were 
being undercut by nonprofit street vendors 
the ordinance required nonprofit organizations to get a 
peddlers permit to sell any merchandise except books leaflets and 
other items that had no value apart from the message they carried 
the lawsuit said the ordinance would muzzle free expression by 
stopping the sale of goods that had value but also carried a 
message such as tshirts stuffed animals or jewelry carrying 
inscriptions the suit was filed in 1986 by the gaudiya vishnava 
society a religious group and joined later by four groups 
representing environmental antiwar and gayrights causes 
us district judge william schwarzer prohibited enforcement of 
the ordinance against sales of messagebearing items his decision 
was affirmed by the appeals court 
the nonprofit groups inform individuals of their causes 
through distributing their literature engaging in persuasive 
speech and selling merchandise with messages affixed to the 
product said the opinion by judge melvin brunetti joining him 
were judges john noonan and harry hupp

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze has expressed interest in dual natowarsaw pact 
membership for a united germany according to an article to be 
published next month 
shevardnadze also said he foresaw a security arrangement between 
europe the soviet union and north ameria that eventually would 
replace both military alliances 
many of our experts believe that the idea of dual 
membership for germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the 
difficulties emerging now shevardnadze wrote in a piece for the 
may issue of natos sixteen nations it is an independent 
magazine covering international security issues 
i would favor a serious and thorough analysis of this 
option he said 
last week in washington us officials said the soviet union 
dropped its demand that a unified germany be militarily neutral it 
continued to oppose membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
west germany is a nato member east germany is in the 
sovietdominated warsaw pact 
the soviet foreign minister wrote that dual membership proposal 
would help overcome further the division of europe contribute to 
its unification and create integrated spaces in it the article 
was made available wednesday to the associated press 
reacting to the article nato spokesman florent swijsen said the 
16nation western alliance remains opposed to dual membership 
the allies are not considering the possibility of a unified 
germany being part of both nato and the warsaw pact he said in a 
statement even several members of the latter warsaw pact have 
indicated their preference for a united germany as a member of 
nato 
nato officials have said that after unification soviet troops 
could be temporarily stationed in what is now east germany 
shevardnadze said in his article that the kremlin believed 
germany should become a military nonaligned state and a 
demilitarized state in the sense that it ought to possess the 
lowest possible military capability sufficient for defense 
at the same time we hold that in the final analysis germany 
should be a fully equal member of todays family of nations and 
become a state like all other states he wrote 
he suggested the new state declare that it will not have 
nuclear chemical or other weapons of mass destruction 
the soviet official outlined his view of how a greater 
europe security structure should look based on the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe the 35 nations 
the united states canada and all in europe except albania will 
hold a summit later this year 
he suggested the organization hold summit meetings of national 
leaders every two years with foreign ministers gathering yearly as 
the top political body 
europe is heading for a new status in terms of its instruments 
of security shevardnadze wrote if and when the blocs vanish 
into thin air and the process must not be artificially boosted 
no vacuum should be allowed to form

for the world traveler or for those who just 
never have enough time comes a new invention a watch designed to 
fool the wearer into thinking hes always at the right time even 
between time zones at 600 mph 
and with hands that can be speeded up or slowed down the watch 
does have its other uses its inventor says time can fly during a 
dull party or crawl for a fun date 
the thing to avoid is having a very boring conversation on a 
westbound trip because your watch is already running slower and 
if the person next to you is boring the pants off you youre in 
trouble said ross mitchell a 38yearold computer systems 
consultant who recently patented the watch 
on the other hand mitchell said if youre going eastbound 
you can tolerate someone whos not holding your interest because 
time is running faster 
mitchell says he created the watch to aid travelers with the 
psychological elements of jet lag by helping the mind adjust to 
living hours ahead or behind what its used to 
it provides the traveler with a seamless means of traveling 
around the world so you would not have any problem with 
experiencing local time as real time for you said mitchell a 
novice inventor 
in the meantime the watch raises some cosmic questions 
part of reality is what you believe said dr martin 
mooreede director of the institute for circadian physiology and 
an associate professor at harvard medical school i think what 
ross has got is one very interesting part of the whole puzzle its 
one of the tools not the panacea but one of the tools that may 
help in adjusting to time zones 
with a regular watch a traveler who boards a plane at 8 am in 
boston would travel six hours to get to los angeles where his 
watch would read 2 pm until he set it back three hours to match 
local time 
the traveler who wears the acclimator watch however punches in 
the time at a destination and the hours to be spent in flight 
then on a westbound flight the hands would move half as fast 
as real time reverting to normal timekeeping upon arrival for 
eastbound travelers the watch would go 50 percent faster than 
normal time 
but what happens if a fellow plane traveler asks what time it is 
the time on your watch is really what time it is for you 
mitchell said 
the watch still might not be the best idea for everybody 
mitchell admits 
its definitely not recommended for pilots in flight because 
if time were moving at an abnormal rate they and the air traffic 
controllers would have difficulty agreeing on what time it was 
mitchell said 
also people who are taking medicine were going to have 
to have a disclaimer mitchell said i could see people suing 
that theyre taking the pill every hour instead every two hours 
because their watches are ahead 
mitchell who lives in suburban newton dreamed up the 
acclimator during his numerous business trips 
for years i would set my watch for the destination as soon as 
i got on the plane which most people do then i had the idea to 
increment my watch one hour at a time to try to smooth it out then 
i thought well gee there would be a way to get the watch to do 
it more smoothly mitchell said 
thousands of man hours and about 10000 in legal fees 
later mitchell received the patent for his watch in february he 
is currently negotiating with several manufacturers and hopes to 
offer the technology on a highpriced face watch by next christmas 
ultimately mitchell said he plans to take the watch abroad he 
has applied for patents in japan europe and canada 
its the soviet union however where mitchell could find his 
windfall the largest country in the world the ussr has no 
less than 11 time zones he noted

a tree planted by president bush and later 
damaged by vandals is making a comeback but city park officials 
say it is too early to tell if it will survive 
the tree is generating buds which is a good sign but does not 
guarantee the sapling will recover parks manager taylor bressler 
said 
a more likely indicator would be the emergence of shoots for new 
branches which should occur during the next few weeks he said 
tuesday 
the tree is an offshoot of an american elm planted on the white 
house lawn in 1826 by president john quincy adams bush gave the 
sapling to the city in september for the washington state 
centennial 
within 48 hours vandals at riverfront park broke several of the 
trees limbs and it was moved to see if it could be salvaged 
no arrests have been made

president fw de klerk met 
wednesday with with desmond tutu and other church leaders to 
discuss how to end black feuds in natal province that have killed 
about 400 people in the past two months 
in the latest violence in south africas black townships 12 
more people were reported killed and 200 injured since monday night 
the situation in natal has reached proportions which are 
beyond human understanding and endurance the south african 
council of churches said in a separate statement 
the church council made up of most major protestant 
denominations called on all people to use holy week through 
easter sunday to focus on prayer and fasting for the people of 
natal in particular and south africa as a whole 
there were no immediate details on de klerks meeting with 
archbishop tutu a nobel peace prize winner and other leaders of 
the south african council of churches 
before the meeting de klerk said i think the churches have a 
role to play in ending the violence in the country 
the king edward viii hospital in the port city of durban said it 
was so overcrowded due to the natal fighting that it temporarily 
stopped admitting patients in need of surgery even emergency cases 
we simply cannot carry out any more surgery said the 
hospital superintendent dr am seedat we have reached a 
situation where we cannot take on a single extra patient 
other hospitals in the area also are near capacity 
eight blacks were killed including six by police fire in 
dozens of clashes in black townships across the country police 
said wednesday in a report covering 56 incidents since monday 
night two hundred people were injured and dozens were arrested 
police said 
governmentrun radio reported four more people died in feuding 
between black political factions in the crossroads township outside 
cape town 
about 4000 people have died in the natal fighting since 1986 
the main combatants are supporters of the african national 
congress the countrys leading antiapartheid group and inkatha 
a relatively conservative zulu organization both organizations 
have large numbers of youthful supporters they cannot control 
criminal gangs and other bands have also taken advantage of the 
chaos to loot burn and murder 
hernus kriel the planning and provincial affairs minister 
toured the northern natal battle zones wednesday and announced a 
100000 aid package for the estimated 13000 zulu refugees 
he said the governments plan for dealing with the crisis would 
be announced in the next week or two but could take six or seven 
years to carry out 
the first thing that strikes me is the poverty of these 
people kriel said we will have to provide the infrastructure 
for such basic needs as water sewerage and rubbish removal 
the police commissioner gen johan van der merwe told 
parliament the secret to ending unrest was to send more security 
forces into troubled areas 
the minister of law and order adriaan vlok said policemen were 
resigning at the rate of 22 per day double the rate of two months 
ago he proposed urgent increases in pay and benefits

an international antidrug summit of 112 nations 
rejected the idea of legalizing narcotics and instead called 
wednesday for a wide range of actions to cut both supply and demand 
of drugs 
earlier in the final day of the threeday conference doctors 
warned that the spread of aids by drug users was increasing 
worldwide 
while strongly rejecting legalization the delegates disagreed 
on punishment for drug abusers however they did back alternatives 
to prison for offenders who want treatment 
us delegates said users must be held accountable but 
authorities from the netherlands said drug abusers should be 
treated like alcoholics or smokers 
delegates were also at odds over programs to make sterile 
needles available to drug users to reduce the spread of aids 
through contaminated needles 
us secretary of health dr louis w sullivan questioned 
research findings showing such programs did not promote increased 
drug use he said the us government refused to fund such programs 
the 35point declaration adopted at the end of the drug 
conference sponsored by britain and the united nations noted that 
the drug market was no longer confined to industrial nations but 
had spread to developing countries 
the declaration called for action at the community neighborhood 
and family level as well as the national and international level 
to prevent drug abuse it said drug education should be started in 
elementary school 
the declaration committed delegates to giving higher priority to 
fighting drugs on all fronts reducing demand eliminating crops 
and drug trafficking preventing laundering of drug money and 
promoting effective treatment and rehabilitation 
us and british experts told a final committee meeting 
wednesday that increased drug use in the developing world was 
raising the number of drug abusers infected by hiv the virus that 
causes aids 
where three years ago hiv infection among drug injectors was 
seen as a developed world problem it is now really seen as a 
worldwide problem said dr don c des jarlais of beth israel 
hospital in new york 
developing countries particularly thailand argentina and 
brazil all reported hiv infection rates among drug injectors of 40 
percent or more in the last three years des jarlais said 
and there is concern that other places where drug injection is 
common such as the middle east are subject to rapid epidemics of 
the spread of hiv among drug users he said 
dr david hawkins of st stephens clinic and westminster 
hospital in london said that by the end of 1990 there are 
projected to be more aids cases in injecting drug users than in 
homosexual men in europe 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a deadly 
affliction in which a virus attacks the bodys immune system it is 
spread mainly by sexual contact the use of contaminated needles 
among drug abusers and transfusion of tainted blood

english at the american university of beirut marked his fourth 
year as a hostage wednesday with no word on his whereabouts the 
longest held is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for 
the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
most of the 18 are held by proiranian shiite moslem factions 
and are considered separate from the abu nidal captives 
a leading iranian newspaper wednesday said all western hostages 
should be freed because keeping people captive contradicts islamic 
teachings 
it was the third time in as many months the tehran times had 
advocated the release of western hostages 
president francois mitterrand personally thanked gadhafi for his 
determining role in freeing the three hostages foreign 
minister roland dumas said frenchlibyan relations would improve 
because of his noble and humanitarian gesture 
us state department officials welcomed the hostages release 
but criticized frances warm words for gadhafi 
such rhetoric is nauseating the british newspaper the 
independent wrote in an editorial reflecting the view of numerous 
newspapers across western europe to describe the reversing of a 
criminal act as highminded and humanitarian carries realpolitik 
too far even by french standards 
le monde a respected french daily asked in a frontpage 
commentary must we give a certificate of good behavior to the 
libyan leader who perhaps wasnt even expecting that much 
french foreign ministry officials said privately they were 
shocked by such biased and scandalous commentary dumas 
said those who criticized the praise for gadhafi were being 
picky 
newspapers in france and across western europe claimed france 
exchanged three fighter planes for the three hostages defense 
minister jeanpierre chevenement denied this saying there was no 
link between the hostages freedom and frances recent decision to 
release the three mirage jets owned by libya and held in france 
four years 
dumas said negotiations for the release of the hostages were 
handled on a state to state level france did not speak with 
the abductors he said 
however the conservative daily le figaro reported that foreign 
ministry envoys handled the diplomatic negotiations while french 
counterespionage agents made contacts with abu nidals group 
the unsourced article claimed the libyan navy abducted the 
hostages mistaking them for israelis when the error was 
discovered the hostages were transferred to abu nidals group to 
be used as a bargaining chip by libya 
the newspaper said the chief point in a contract to free the 
hostages centered on the lifting of a french arms embargo against 
libya it was set up in 1983 when the two nations backed different 
sides in chads civil war 
paul wilkinson director of the research institute for the study 
of conflict and terrorism said the hostage release proves an 
ongoing link between gadhafi and abu nidal 
the public should be warned against euphoria over the latest 
hostage release in lebanon wilkinson said in london it was 
obtained by a deal which violates the european community policy of 
no concessions under duress to terrorists or their sponsors 
in addition such actions encourage terrorist states and 
groups to believe that big rewards can be gained and put more 
innocent lives at risk he said 
tuesdays liberation was the second time libya intervened on 
frances behalf for the hostages two other daughters of ms 
valente were freed in december 1989 france also thanked libya 
then it was seen as an image booster for gadhafi who was being 
virulently attacked in the west

cruse who did not release the scientists name 
she finally wrote us a letter and sent us the money she 
didnt want us bugging her any more she wanted to clear her good 
name and come back to seattle eventually without being arrested 
cruse said 
in another case officers recently tracked down a woman in 
switzerland who paid the city 1200 in outstanding fines cruse

friends and relatives of brian 
keenan held a twohour vigil in his native belfast on wednesday as 
keenan began his fifth year in captivity in lebanon 
no group has claimed to hold keenan a 39yearold english 
teacher but he was seen being kidnapped by gunmen april 11 1986 
as he walked to the american university of beirut in the citys 
moslem sector 
in belfast prayers were said as members of the friends of brian 
keenan action group gathered in the city center the release of 
three european hostages in lebanon on tuesday encouraged the 
gathering 
keenans sister brenda gillham said she would never give up 
hope that her brother would be released 
its very hard to explain how im feeling today you feel sad 
but are still hopeful you never give up hope mrs gillham said 
in beirut a lebanese police spokesman said he had no 
information on either keenan or any of the other 17 westerners held 
hostage mainly by proiranian shiite moslem factions in lebanon 
we only have routine files on the hostages their case is 
largely considered as a nondomestic issue the spokesman said 
speaking on condition of anonymity in line with police regulations 
the hostages may be held on lebanese territory by some 
lebanese tools but those who can determine their fate are 
certainly not lebanese he added 
he apparently was referring to iran whose closest ally in 
lebanon is hezbollah or party of god the umbrella group for 
hostageholding factions there have been periodic reports that 
some hostages were turned over to irans revolutionary guards in 
lebanon for security 
in addition to keenan the foreign captives are eight americans 
four britons two swiss two west germans and an italian 
the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press he was kidnapped march 16 
1985 
they are considered separate from four belgians held by abu 
nidals libyabacked palestinian group 
abu nidals group freed three other captives on tuesday 
frenchwoman jacqueline valente 32 belgian fernand houtekins 43 
and their 2yearold daughter sophieliberte were flown tuesday 
night to paris after being released to french diplomats earlier in 
the day 
a tehran newspaper on wednesday said the release of the three 
should be a prelude to the release of all hostages as their 
captivity contradicted islamic teachings 
the englishlanguage daily tehran times which often reflects 
the opinions of president hashemi rafsanjani said in fact the 
issue of hostage taking should come to an end for all with no 
discrimination 
it was the third time in as many months that the newspaper had 
advocated the release of western hostages 
rafsanjani and other iranian moderates have stressed their 
support for releasing the hostages seeing it as a way of improving 
ties with the west at a time iran seeks financing and technical aid 
but radical hardliners who apparently hold greater sway over 
those holding the hostages have repeatedly said they support 
hostagetaking as a way to confront the corrupt west

a 29yearold atlas 
rocket that once was armed with nuclear warheads thundered into 
space wednesday carrying three small research satellites into a 
polar orbit 
it took off quickly and was gone in an instant said air 
force spokesman maj tom worsdale everyone was pleased with the 
smoothness of the operation and the success of the launch 
the 91foottall atlase topped by a 5foottall scoutaltair 
upper stage booster blasted off the pad at space launch complex 3 
at 8 am pdt emerging from a low fog bank over this sprawling 
coastal military base 140 miles northwest of los angeles 
the liquidfueled atlas similar to the rocket that lifted john 
glenn to orbit earth in 1962 flew south over the pacific fifteen 
minutes after liftoff the solid fuel upper stage separated from 
the payload delivering the three satellites into a polar orbit 460 
miles above earth worsdale said 
the mission cost 22 million said ed parsons chief spokesman 
for the air forces space systems division in los angeles 
one satellite will test new computer memory circuits and measure 
earths magnetic field to help make navigation charts used by ships 
and planes 
the others will test a new communications device and study 
phenomena in earths upper atmosphere that interfere with 
spacetoground radio communications said capt mark goodman 
project manager 
the atlas was built in 1961 by general dynamics and once served 
as a nuclear warheadtipped intercontinental ballistic missile at 
forbes air force base in kansas it was refurbished in 1987 for use 
as a launch vehicle 
the air force originally planned to launch the three satellites 
on a scout rocket but none was available atlase rockets normally 
launch larger payloads such as weather satellites the atlas 
launched wednesday had what the air force described only as 
slightly degraded performance that prevented it from lofting a 
heavier payload 
each satellite weighs only 120 to 150 pounds 
the uppermost satellite named polar orbiting geomagnetic 
survey contains a magnetometer to measure the strength of the 
earths magnetic field at various locations 
the data will be used to help draw new defense mapping agency 
geomagnetic charts many ships and aircraft navigate using 
computerized versions of the charts which are updated every five 
years as the magnetic field changes goodman said 
the satellite also contains the solid state recorder experiment 
meant to demonstrate the use of highspeed integrated circuit 
designs as computer memory devices in space and to make sure they 
can withstand the radiation in space parsons said 
the second satellite named tex or transceiver experiment will 
bounce radio signals of different power levels off the ionosphere 
the part of earths upper atmosphere containing irregularities that 
can disrupt highfrequency radio communications 
the third satellite the selective communications experiment 
will conduct similar studies by bouncing radio signals of varying 
frequencies off the ionosphere the air force hopes to learn what 
power and frequency levels can be used to overcome disruption of 
radio communications

the opposition movement that successfully 
campaigned for the restoration of multiparty democracy in this 
himalayan kingdom set conditions wednesday for joining a proposed 
interim government 
the centrist nepali congress party and the united left front a 
leftwing coalition refused to join the interim government unless 
it was headed by either king birendra or their own nominee 
the opposition groups said they would not accept a member of the 
nonpartisan rashtriya panchayat or national assembly as prime 
minister 
we shall never agree to a person becoming a prime minister who 
is not a member of either party or the king himself nepali 
congress party president kp bhattarai told reporters 
the two groups set out their conditions in a joint statement 
that responded to birendras invitation to join an interim 
government the king sunday bowed to nationwide protsts organized 
by the groups and lifted a 29year ban on political parties 
the statement urged the immediate dissolution of the national 
assembly and the repeal of portions of the constitution considered 
incompatible with a multiparty democracy 
meanwhile staterun radio reported that the government has 
decided to drop all criminal cases against people arrested during 
the sevenweek prodemocracy campaign 
bhattarai said the opposition also wanted compensation for 
families of those killed during the crackdown and punishment of 
officials found guilty through an independent investigation of 
atrocities in suppressing protests unless the conditions are 
met bhattarai said the nepali congress party and united left 
front will not join the provisional government 
we are willing to give them a reasonable period of time to 
fulfill the demands he added 
sahana pradhan chairwoman of the sevenparty united left front 
said all the groups in the leftwing coalition supported the 
demands in the joint statement 
at present we agree she said without elaborating 
the role of the king in the new political system remains unclear 
earlier wednesday foreign minister pashupati shamsher rana said 
birendra had given up participation in active politics and wanted 
the government to soothe and heal the wounds caused by the 
crackdown on the democracy campaign 
the statement was the first admission by a government official 
of the kings diminished importance in nepals new democratic 
system 
rana said the king by dropping the word partyless from the 
constitution has relinquished participation in active politics 
but staterun radio continued to refer to the government as 
his majestys government on wednesday 
political parties were banned in nepal 29 years ago when the 
democratically elected government formed by the nepali congress 
party was dismissed by king mahendra birendras father 
the nepali congress party went underground to push for a 
restoration of multiparty democracy and the leftwing coalition 
joined the campaign 
the movement was formally launched feb 18 and drew support from 
academicians professionals and peasants it peaked with a series 
of strikes and demonstrations last week 
witnesses said 200 people were killed friday alone when police 
fired on prodemocracy protesters the government said only 10 
people were killed 
birendra 44 is the heir of the shaha dynasty that has held the 
throne since the middle of the 18th century many nepalis 
especially illiterate farmers who form the bulk of this countrys 
17 million people view him as the reincarnation of the hindu god 
vishnu

reaching up to propel or stop the ride and have entrapped or 
pinched a finger in the bracket mechanism causing severed 
fingertips and severe cuts the company said 
as temperatures rise and children head outdoors to play the 
company has become concerned because there has been such low 
consumer response to a november 1988 repair program the consumer 
product safety commission said in an announcement reinstituting the 
original offer 
in addition there have been 19 more serious injuries reported 
in connection with the sets since the program began the cpsc said

new peak of anger

and killed seven kashmiri militants who were trying to cross 
illegally into pakistan which borders the kashmir valley

kashmir traded bitter words over the latest violence pakistani 
troops were put on high alert wednesday after indias leader talked 
of war

men abducted last week by moslem separatists demanding the release 
of three jailed colleagues the bodies were found tuesday in the 
far northern city of srinagar the hub of the secession drive

rights where innocent persons are being made victims of senseless 
externally inspired and motivated violence foreign ministry

angolas marxist government has agreed 
to start direct peace talks this month with usbacked rebels to 
end their 15yearold civil war the official angolan news agency 
reported wednesday 
a rebel spokesman welcomed the announcement which followed his 
sides offer monday of an immediate ceasefire the guerrillas had 
also proposed talks 
an initial truce and june talks mediated by president mobutu 
sese seko of zaire collapsed within weeks and fighting has 
intensified in recent months 
in a dispatch released wednesday in lisbon the angop news 
agency quoted deputy foreign minister venancio de moura of angola 
as saying probably this month and next month representatives 
of the angolan government and elements of unita will meet to 
discuss the internal problem 
the rebels of unita or national union for the total 
independence of angola are led by jonas savimbi 
the angolan news agency quoted sources in luanda angolas 
capital as saying initial direct contacts would be held in 
portugal probably april 16 with later talks in the west african 
archipelago of cape verde angola in southwestern africa is a 
former portuguese colony that gained independence in 1975 
a unita spokesman in lisbon norberto de castro said he had 
received no official confirmation of the angop report but he 
welcomed the government proposal 
he said it is a sign the government understands the 
situation 
for us any date will do for talks de castro told the 
associated press in the telephone interview 
a spokesman for the portuguese foreign ministry said his country 
would be prepared to play host to the talks but had received no 
official confirmation 
in recent months angolan government forces have pressed deep 
into the rebels southeastern heartlands unita meanwhile has 
stepped up urban bomb and sabotage attacks in luanda 
the stalemate has apparently put pressure on hardliners from 
both sides to give up the idea of military victory and return to 
the negotiating table 
in addition the superpowers eager to end one of the last 
vestiges of the cold war have been pushing both sides to make 
peace us aid to unita is reportedly 50 million or more a year 
and western experts put soviet aid to the angolan government much 
higher 
angola agreed in a 1988 usbrokered accord that an estimated 
50000 cuban troops backing its forces would be withdrawn 
unita says the war has killed more than 200000 people 
foreign minister pedro de castro van dunem of angola was quoted 
in a separate angop dispatch as saying unitas proposal for a 
ceasefire and talks in lisbon seem to be more realistic and 
show a certain willingness to end the conflict peacefully 
he reaffirmed the governments willingness to reopen the peace 
process immediately saying the angolan people are tired of war 
and suffering according to angop 
issues expected to be discussed at talks include forming a 
transitional government demobilization of armies savimbis 
political future and possibly elections 
government sources in luanda said they expected a ceasefire 
could be signed by july

a month after creating a presidential structure 
with himself as head mikhail s gorbachev has shifted the burden 
of setting policy on the economy and lithuania from the communist 
party to new government bodies 
but his closest adviser has left no doubt that it is neither the 
party nor new government bodies that make the final decisions it 
is gorbachev himself 
on saturday gorbachev says he will meet with his two new 
presidential advisory groups the presidential council and the 
council of the federation to agree on a new set of economic 
reforms they are expected to be by far the most radical the soviet 
leader has attempted 
after lithuania last week rejected gorbachevs demand to 
renounce its declaration of independence in order to open talks 
with moscow the kremlins reaction came from the presidential 
council 
the soviet news agency tass said monday that members of the 
presidential council concluded that additional economic political 
and other measures should be taken to protect the soviet 
constitution and the interests of citizens living in the republic 
and the soviet union as a whole 
gorbachev also has consulted with the council of the federation 
made up of representatives of each soviet republic on the 
lithuania dispute 
meanwhile the communist partys politburo and central committee 
have been silent for decades they have been at the heart of soviet 
decisionmaking leaving the government only to implement their 
directives but gorbachev has pledged to reduce their power to 
making broad policy decisions 
gorbachev remains the communist party chief as he has been for 
the past five years but his election to the post of president 
symbolized that pledge and the shift of emphasis since then on his 
biggest policy headaches lithuania and the economy appears to 
confirm that such a change really is taking place 
gorbachevs point man on economic reform deputy premier leonid 
abalkin bluntly told reporters the politburo no longer would be 
forming economic policy 
the politburo will not be making any decisions from now on 
and it is already not making the decisions he said decisions 
can be made by the president the parliament and the congress of 
peoples deputies those are the decisionmaking entities now 
the presidential council is a handpicked advisory committee 
including such top gorbachev advisers as politburo member alexander 
n yakovlev and foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze for 
balance it includes conservatives like writer valentin rasputin of 
irkutsk and workers representative veniamin yarin of 
nizhnitagilsk 
yakovlev in an interview with tass last week emphasized that 
gorbachev might turn to the presidential council for advice but 
that it is up to the president to decide 
the goal of creating the presidential council is to serve as a 
consultative organ to the new institution of power in the country 
to help form and bring to life the political line of the president 
as part of the general policy of the soviet government yakovlev 
said 
in any instance the right to choose the right of decision 
belongs to the president he added the council can and must 
analyze work out proposals make recommendations raise questions 
of its own initiative 
its formation gives gorbachev the power to bypass more 
conservative politburo members like yegor k ligachev and take 
policy questions to a group more closely in tune with his own 
views the new structure seems to have vested gorbachev with more 
power than he wielded even as communist party chief 
despite five years of reforms the partys central committee 
still is riddled with party bureaucrats who are suspicious of his 
reforms and the central committee must make any changes in the 
politburo 
in recent months as gorbachev established the new presidential 
form of government the central committee was limited to adopting a 
new platform that endorsed the reforms gorbachev sought to make 
after tough debate it agreed to surrender its monopoly on 
political power and to endorse the principle of private property 
in explaining to a congress of the komsomol communist youth 
league on tuesday how officials will put a new economic program 
into place gorbachev left little room for the communist party

fire doors malfunctioned and 
ventilation ducts were left open to fan the flames of the deadly 
fire that gutted the ferry scandinavian star a fire inspector told 
a hearing wednesday 
but the captain of the danish ship told the inquiry that all the 
fire equipment and safety procedures worked and that the crew 
performed well in the emergency 
captain hugo larsen of norway said he was awakened by a ships 
officer at 155 am saturday and told someone is playing 
arsonist as the first of three fires was discovered aboard the 
ship 
in oslo police reduced the number of dead and missing to 168 
as more missing passengers reported to police at least one 
american was among the dead officials in sweden where the ship 
was towed said they recovered 127 bodies and had estimated up to 
200 may have died 
about 500 people were on board the ship in the north sea 
one unidentified west german was discovered trying to swindle 
authorities for compensation by reporting five family members on 
board a police official said 
the fire broke out when the 10500ton scandinavian star was 
midway on an overnight trip from oslo norway to fredrickshaven 
denmark 
arson was the highly probable cause but no motive has been 
found said oslo police chief magnar aukrust at the copenhagen 
inquiry fire inspector flemming jensen pinpointed fires in three 
separate places 
the first was in a pile of woolen blankets in a passageway 
outside a cabin below the car deck it was quickly doused by a 
ships officer 
the other two began shortly afterward in stairwells on either 
side of the ferry jensen said the blaze spread up the staircases 
past several decks and burst into the main restaurant area he said 
the three fires must have ignited independently he said but he 
did not speculate on their causes 
after a fivehour tour of the 470foot vessel at its mooring in 
lysekil sweden jensen said only five of the vessels 15 fire 
doors closed as they should have during the blaze hatches to the 
ships ventilation ducts also were left open he said 
fire doors are made of metal or other fireresistant material 
and are designed to keep fires from spreading 
the firefighting equipment was in good shape but it appeared 
not to have been in use jensen said 
the ferry lacked one fire door on the main deck between the 
restaurant area and the open stern deck it should have been added 
during a recent renovation and expansion of the restaurant area he 
said 
larsen admitted under questioning that alarm bells were 
disconnected in corridors and cabins because of too many false 
alarms but he said pressing the alarm button set off lights on the 
bridge and each was investigated by an officer 
the scandinavian star registered in the bahamas caught fire 
two years in the gulf of mexico when it was americanowned and a 
us investigation pointed out flaws in safety and training of the 
crew 
the ship was bought last month by dano lines based in 
copenhagen 
larsen who has been accused of abandoning the ship too early 
said he and his crew did everything humanly possible to save 
lives before leaving in the last lifeboat 
looking haggard and answering questions with a word or half 
sentence larsen said he had no idea about people below decks 
i knew there were some passengers on the stern deck and called 
for a rescue boat from the ferry stena saga to pick them up 
which happened he said 
he said he left when he could no longer stay on the bridge 
because of heavy smoke 
larsen who along with the other crew and surviving passengers 
was rescued by a swedish ferry returned to the burning 
scandinavian star five hours later to help firefighters start the 
ships water pumps 
the inquiry was expected to hear 15 to 20 witnesses during the 
next three or four days and is coordinating its findings with those 
of norwegian and swedish authorities 
at a meeting late tuesday the maritime directors of sweden 
norway and denmark approved tighter measures to inspect ships 
flying foreign flags of convenience in nordic waters 
the commission decided that the foreignflagged ships must in 
the future undergo safety checks by a nordic maritime authority and 
the crew must demonstrate firefighting skills 
about 60 million passengers travel nordic routes every year

president bush on wednesday issued the 
executive order he promised last november to protect chinese 
students from deportation to their politically troubled homeland 
bushs order directs the attorney general to defer until jan 1 
1994 any deportation procedings against chinese nationals who were 
in the united states on or after june 5 1989 and whose visas 
expire 
many chinese students fear reprisals because they supported the 
prodemocracy movement that was crushed when the beijing government 
turned military tanks on its own people in tiananmen square last 
spring 
instead of starting deportation proceedings the government will 
notify the chinese nationals when their visas expire under the 
order signed by bush 
such chinese nationals also will have the right to seek 
employment in the united states through jan 1 1994 under terms 
set forth by bush 
a requirement that chinese nationals must have valid passports 
will be waived under the order the government also will furnish 
documents to facilitate travel across the borders of other 
nations and reentry into the united states for those whose 
passports expired under the order 
bush had announced he would protect the chinese students who 
feared persecution following beijings brutal crackdown on 
prodemocracy demonstrators last june 
on nov 30 he vetoed legislation designed to extend visa 
protections to the chinese nationals but he said then that he 
would issue an executive order to guarantee that no one would be 
forced to return to china 
instead of issuing the executive order bush initially produced 
a directive containing guidelines for immigration officials 
that brought a rash of published reports and congressional 
criticism 
on friday he pledged anew to issue the order we dont want 
to take a chance on people being mistreated brutalized bush 
said

continental airlines paid the government 
215000 in fines for safety violations including failure to make 
required repairs on two airliners the federal aviation 
administration said wednesday 
the fines were proposed by the faa after a fiveweek inspection 
of its operations more than a year ago said faa spokesman fred 
farrar 
he said continental responded quickly to remedy violations cited 
the deficiencies included improper weighing of an aircraft use 
of outofdate performance and planning manuals at eight airports 
operation of a boeing 727 without repairing a faulty escape slide 
and failure to repair a cargo hold heater on a dc10 within the 
required time 
other fines against continental resulting from the inspection 
and other inspections are being considered farrar said he said it 
routinely takes lawyers from several months to a year or more to 
prepare proposed fines following inspections 
several thousand cases involving possible fines against various 
airlines are pending 
under a new policy announced last month by faa administrator 
james busey airlines will be able to escape penalties if they 
quickly report and correct safety violations 
the faa has the authority to levy fines of 1000 against 
individuals and 10000 against airlines for each safety violation 
without filing charges in court 
the continental inspection described as one of the most 
extensive ever undertaken by the faa involved 50 government 
inspectors in october and november 1988 at several airports used by 
the airline

ambassadors home wednesday to pay homage to the marquis de 
lafayette hero of the american revolution over a candlelight 
dinner featuring dishes from the menu at lafayettes wedding feast 
in 1774 
a crier in powdered wig and knee britches announced each guest 
and a trio of costumed chamber musicians played mozart and other 
18th century favorites for the blacktie dinner given by le cordon 
bleu the famed paris cooking school 
those lucky enough to receive invitations to one of the most 
exclusive social events of washingtons spring season dined on a 
jelly of oysters in caviar cream sauce filet of sole baby squab 
served in silver cups and a slab of roast venison on a spit which 
was carried into the dining room on the shoulders of two chefs 
goblets under the baccarat crystal candelabra which were 
decorated with cascades of pink roses tulips and spring flowers 
were filled with six fine french wines and champagne 
dessert was chocolatecovered pineapple ice cream served in a 
pineapple shell held by three sculpted chocolate hands the palate 
freshener for the sevencourse dinner was a sorbet laced with 
cognac from the 900acre cointreau estate in france 
the guests were pleased to receive invitations but some 
people were very displeased they were not coming said andre 
cointreau a descendant of the french liqueur producers and 
president of le cordon bleu we were sorry we could not 
accommodate everyone 
besides french ambassador jacques andreani the guest list 
included leading washington journalists and food writers former 
un ambassador jeane kirkpatrick agriculture secretary clayton 
yeutter and katharine graham chairman of the washington post co 
patrick martin 32 a rising star among classical french chefs

revolutionary war as an honorary major general under the command of 
his close friend george washington he was credited with the 
defensive military maneuvers that resulted in the british surrender

expression of gratitude to american oil magnate john moffat who 
early in this century bought and restored the crumbling 
chavagnallafayette castle in the auvergne region where lafayette 
was born 
moffat housed several hundred french orphans from world war i at 
the castle which is now held by trustees of the nonprofit

labor party leader shimon peres won additional 
time to put together a governing coalition after the lastminute 
defection of two religious lawmakers wednesday spoiled his 
immediate hopes of becoming prime minister 
shouting matches erupted in parliament after attempts to form a 
new government failed the breakdown renewed anger in israel over 
the disproportionate influence of small rightwing religious 
parties which serve as kingmakers in any attempt to form a 
governing coalition 
whoever says this is democracy is speaking nonsense said 
amnon rubinstein of the leftwing shinui party we cant continue 
with this method 
president chaim herzog granted peres 15 more days to pull 
together a government peres has vowed to make peace negotiations 
with palestinians his first priority 
he ruled out a return to the likudlabor government which 
collapsed march 15 over peace moves the rightwing likud refused 
to accept us proposals paving the way for israelipalestinian 
talks in cairo 
lets never forget that the government fell on the issue of 
peace lets remember that the issue of peace should be the major 
consideration peres told reporters 
peres had planned to present his coalition to the knesset or 
parliament for approval wednesday he was counting on the support 
of 61 of the 120 legislators including five from the 
ultraorthodox agudat israel party 
but hours before the vote agudat lawmaker avraham verdiger 
announced that he had resigned from parliament party colleague 
eliezer mizrahi then said he would vote against peres 
lawmakers shouted at the top of their lungs pounded on tables 
and wagged fingers at each other when it became clear peres lacked 
a majority each speaker was interrupted repeatedly 
abdul wahab daroushe an arab parliamentarian demanded that 
knesset speaker dov shilansky denounce those who rule out israeli 
arabs from taking part in the decisionmaking process 
hardliner eliakim haetzni jumped up from his seat and lunged 
toward daroushe but was restrained by guards 
mohammed miari another member of parliament screamed at 
haetzni youre a racist youre a murderer 
both verdiger and mizrahi are political hardliners opposed to 
the centerleft labor partys philosophy of accepting territorial 
compromise in exchange for peace 
when he announced he was quitting verdiger said he had sought 
the advice of the lubavitcher rabbi menachem schneerson of 
brooklyn ny a leading hasidic figure with great influence in 
israel although he has never been to the jewish state 
the rabbi said that nothing has changed in his position on 
eretz israel verdiger said on israel radio schneerson has 
written that the biblical land of israel including occupied 
territory was given by god to the jews and must not be surrendered 
rubinstein responded with anger and said the defections 
strengthened calls for electoral reform including direct election 
of the prime minister 
we want to ask the country which prime minister they want 
rubinstein said on israel television is this not better than 
asking some rabbi who is sitting in brooklyn 
herzog warned that the political maneuvering surrounding 
formation of a coalition has raised piercing questions about our 
system of government and our political culture 
both labor and likud have openly offered political favors to 
lure defectors from the opposite camp the backroom deals have 
sparked a grassroots campaign for electoral reform to lessen the 
power of minority parties more than 90 percent of israels 
population is not ultraorthodox 
also wednesday two palestinians were killed in 
interpalestinian violence and israeli soldiers shot and wounded 
seven others during protests in the occupied territories the army 
and arab reports said 
the army also said three palestinians were injured when police 
broke up a stonethrowing demonstration outside a high school in 
east jerusalem sources said one suffered a broken hand and the two 
others were overcome by tear gas 
the deaths brought to 206 the number of palestinians killed by 
fellow arabs in the 28month uprising against israeli occupation of 
the west bank and gaza most have been slain as suspected 
collaborators 
at least 673 other palestinians have been killed by israeli 
soldiers or civilians during the revolt and 43 israelis have been 
killed

appeal to pig farmers saying that if such drastic sanitary

prime ministerdesignate lothar de maiziere 
finished forming his government wednesday and reached an agreement 
with political partners on east germanys terms for unification 
with west germany 
the agreement clears the way for parliament to formally put de 
maizieres government in office so it can begin talks with west 
germany on merging their nations 
now it is good de maiziere said after nearly a week of 
coalition talks ended his conservative alliance won a majority in 
the countrys first free election march 18 
no details were immediately available on the coalition 
agreement but de maiziere whose christian democrats favor speedy 
unification and a dramatic shift to capitalism gave key 
ministerial posts to social democrats who favor a slower 
transition some concessions were likely 
many east germans fear hard times when subsidies and other 
aspects of the 4decadeold communist system are scrapped a new 
study said 15 million people in this country of 16 million could 
be thrown out of work in five years unless unification brings a 
spurt of growth 
on thursday parliament is expected to formally name de maiziere 
prime minister and install his 24member cabinet and the policy 
agreement is to be signed social democrats were nominated to hold 
seven of the portfolios including party chief markus meckel as 
foreign minister and walter romberg as finance minister 
in bonn a west german government spokesman said chancellor 
helmut kohl wants to sign a treaty on monetary union between the 
two states by may 6 with the currency merger to go into effect by 
july 7 
kohls spokesman dieter vogel said the chancellor wants talks 
to begin as quickly as possible on the sensitive issue of 
converting east german currency into west german marks 
but de maiziere said an east german timetable for unification 
was not yet fixed 
an increasingly restive work force worried about rampant 
unemployment planned demonstrations to coincide with thursdays 
second session of the nations first freely elected parliament 
a farmers organization said it would drive tractors and farm 
implements through east berlin to demand an orderly transition to 
private ownership of property 
telephone and other electronics workers fearing unemployment 
called a threehour strike thursday in east berlin 
while workers worry about their future foreign businesses have 
been flooding the east bloc to tap the new consumer market the 
east german government news agency adn said 599 joint ventures have 
been formed since the borders were opened in november another 400 
are expected by the end of april 
it said 60 percent of the enterprises are in the service and 
tourism industry and about 96 percent involve west german 
companies 
but east germany would have to experience an 85 percent annual 
growth rate to head off massive unemployment according to a study 
by the institute for international politics and economics in east 
berlin 
adn quoted the agency as saying a 5 percent growth rate still 
would result in up to 15 million jobless by 1995 and 26 million 
by 2000 
de maizieres coalition favors quickly enacted laws allowing 
ownership of private property and private ownership of east 
germanys factories and enterprises 
the social democrats want employees to be able to take part in 
ownership of factories they say east germans will face higher 
prices and many will lose their jobs as inefficent businesses and 
enterprises are closed 
a key point in the coalition talks was how much the virtually 
worthless east german mark would be worth in a unified germany 
west germanys central bank proposes exchanging most east german 
marks at a 21 rate to west german marks savings accounts with 
less than 2000 marks about 1200 would be exchanged at a 11 
rate 
de maizieres designated economics minister gerhard pohl said 
tuesday that he favored a 30000mark ceiling on 11 conversions 
de maizieres threeparty coalition holds the most seats in the 
new 400member parliament but needs a twothirds majority to 
rewrite the constitution to make a merger with west germany 
possible 
the new government will eventually take part in talks with west 
germany and the four world war ii allies the united states 
britain france and the soviet union on reunification 
one of the biggest questions to be dealt with in those talks is 
the military alliance of a united germany west germany is 
currently a member of nato but the soviet union has refused to 
accept nato membership for the new germany 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze has expressed 
interest in dual natowarsaw pact membership for a united germany 
according to an article to be published next month in natos 
sixteen nations an independent magazine that covers 
international security issues 
reacting to the article nato spokesman florent swijsen said the 
western military alliance remains opposed to dual membership

president mikhail s gorbachev warned in remarks 
broadcast wednesday that recarving internal soviet borders would 
lead to civil war and such bloody carnage that we wont be able 
to crawl out of it 
he told members of the communist youth league he had spent more 
time thinking about whether he should allow changes in the 
countrys political map than any other issue and decided against 
it 
more than 100 ethnic groups inhabit the soviet union under 
gorbachevs democratizing reforms many have begun to clamor for 
lands that were historically theirs and for more freedom from 
moscow lithuania based its march 11 declaration of independence on 
claims it was illegally annexed 50 years ago 
gorbachev said redrawing soviet boundaries would pit all 
peoples and all nations against each other and bring about a 
situation in this society the likes of which has never been 
witnessed by our country or by the world 
and if other republics follow lithuanias example and try to 
secede he said if we begin to divide up ill give it to you 
bluntly well end up in such a civil war in such bloody carnage 
that we wont be able to crawl out of it 
gorbachev issued dire predictions about ethnic conflict before 
but his statements tuesday at a questionandanswer session with a 
congress of young communists broadcast by soviet tv on wednesday 
appeared pointed at lithuania 
the kremlin has been locked in a confrontation with lithuanian 
leaders since they declared the baltic republics independence 
gorbachev issued the latest in a series of harsh warnings to the 
lithuanians monday but tuesday he backed off saying he did not 
see a need to impose presidential rule there yet 
in the broadcast remarks gorbachev said he was sure residents 
of lithuania would vote against the republics independence once 
they understood the frightening array of problems it created 
the lithuanian people are a wise people he said and will 
realize that lithuania needs independence but within the 
framework of the soviet union 
he spelled out the major problems facing the breakaway republic 
territorial disputes with byelorussia and over the port of klaipeda 
loom some soviet plants are cutting off their ties with lithuanian 
enterprises and many nonlithuanian residents may need to be 
resettled outside the republic 
gorbachev accused leaders of sajudis the movement that 
spearheaded lithuanias independence drive and now controls its 
government of trying to persuade ethnic activists in the caucasus 
region to create disturbances in their support 
he said they appealed to certain circles in azerbaijan and 
armenia saying what are you sitting here for light a fire to 
create a front against the center gorbachev added that the 
full weight of the law should be brought against ethnic 
agitators 
lithuanias independence drive has remained nonviolent but 
ethnic conflicts in the caucasus region and central asia have left 
hundreds of victims the last two years 
gorbachev who spoke in a warm somewhat fatherly tone to the 
komsomol members also touched on an impending split in the 
countrys communist party

radicals of trying to split the entire party nationwide and

the army will no longer shoot goats to train 
physicians at fort sam houston to treat gunshot wounds a 
physicians group that sought the moratorium said wednesday 
the physicians committee for responsible medicine said 800 to 
1000 goats were being shot each year at the san antonio texas 
base 
the practice continues at fort bragg nc and as many as 1200 
goats are involved the committee said 
dr neal d barnard a psychiatrist and president of the 
organization said the group sought in moratorium after specialists 
such as radiologists and psychiatrists who normally dont treat 
trauma victims were told to participate in the fort sam houston 
training 
its not a very nice thing to be shooting these animals 
secondly its not even very good training barnard said 
the wound of a goat is far different from a human wound he 
said shooting a goat in the leg has no relation to an abdominal 
wound or a chest wound or a head wound the tissue feels 
different in the goat its got thick hairy skin 
barnard said the army had been shooting goats to train doctors 
since 1958 
pat davis chief of public affairs for the armys academy of 
health sciences at fort sam houston said she couldnt confirm how 
long the shootings had been taking place the ban took effect about 
90 days ago 
the physicians group she said was inaccurate in saying the 
goats were being shot the army uses a firing mechanism which 
she described as a small square box to fire a projectile or 
metal pellet into a goats leg 
the military had been using the pellets to simulate the 
shocking impact of firing at a human from a military weapon 
military weapons fire projectiles at a far higher speed than 
handguns she said 
military weapons cause a great deal of destruction to the 
tissue she said if military physicians dont clean the wound 
correctly the guy will lose his limb and probably his life 
barnard said the armys decision was only temporary and that his 
organization would push for a permanent ban along with a ban at 
fort bragg 
ms davis said she was not sure whether the ban was permanent or 
temporary goats will still be used for other surgical procedures 
she said

revolution in east germany and had nonmusical interests that 
might have made it difficult for us to attract him to new york

be largely musical

after his resigning with the st louis symphony

constantine mitsotakis was sworn in as 
premier wednesday ending 10 months of political deadlock to cap 
his conservative partys comeback nine years after being defeated 
by the socialists of andreas papandreou 
the new government leader immediately pledged four years of 
stable leadership his new democracy party won elections sunday 
after two inconclusive polls in june and november 
shortly after the new 38member cabinet was sworn in by greek 
orthodox archbishop seraphim at the presidential mansion the 
fledgling administration received the blessing of the nations 
elder statesman sixtime premier and former president constantine 
karamanlis 
after the 45minute meeting at karamanlis home mitsotakis said 
the 83yearold elder stateman had accepted a proposal to run for 
president karamanlis who introduced the institution of the 
presidency in 1974 relinquished his bid for reelection in 1985 
when the governing socialists reneged on a promise to back his 
candidacy 
karamanlis is almost certain to gain the 151 votes in parliament 
needed for his election 
new democracy won 150 seats in the 300member parliament in 
sundays elections on monday it gained the support of the lone 
deputy elected on the rightwing democratic renewal party ticket 
giving it a majority 
this government can and will accomplish much substantially 
and we are determined to accomplish this with a fouryear term in 
mind mitsotakis said after his cabinets first meeting 
one unusual name in the new cabinet list was composer mikis 
theodorakis who gained fame in 1963 with his score for the 
awardwinning film zorba the greek he was appointed minister 
without portfolio 
new democracy returns to power after losing to papandreous 
panhellenic socialist movement or pasok in a landslide in 1981 
during a wave of antiamericanism 
mitsotakis has promised to improve relations with the united 
states which has four military bases in greece he also has said 
he would be willing to extradite to the united states a palestinian 
suspected of involvement in the bombing of an american passenger 
jet in 1982 
previous governments were ambivalent about the bases and stalled 
on extraditing the suspect 
the new conservative government faces a 156 billion budget 
deficit and an inflation rate that reached 178 percent last month 
more than triple the european community average 
the government plans to improve the economy by slashing state 
spending streamlining the huge public sector and encouraging 
private investment 
mitsotakis has asked president christos sartzetakis to speed up 
the opening of parliament scheduled for april 23 so the 
government can present its programs and seek a vote of confidence 
next week 
after the june elections a governing new democracycommunist 
alliance indicted papandreou and senior socialists on corruption 
charges but failed to tackle pressing economic and foreign policy 
issues no trial dates have been set 
the worsening economy prompted the conservatives communists and 
socialists to join in a threeparty administration after another 
inconclusive election in november but this alliance was also 
shortlived and ineffective 
without a doubt our parliamentary majority is slim 
mitsotakis said wednesday but there is also the margin given to 
us by the broader spectrum of our people the tolerance and the 
hope that it has stored in us

a report that called the oyster creek 
nuclear generating station the nations worst plant for protecting 
workers from radiation has come under heavy criticism from the 
employees themselves 
my friends make a lot of jokes about me glowing in the dark 
said margaret martin a radiological control worker who has worked 
at the plant since 1988 thats just lack of education 
a study released tuesday by public citizen a washingtonbased 
organization founded by consumer advocate ralph nader said there 
were 2875 incidents of worker exposure at oyster creek in 1988 
the figure is double the plants 1987 exposure mark and triple 
the 1988 average of the nations other 106 commercial nuclear power 
plants according to the report glowing on the job 
gleaned from nuclear regulatory commission documents the report 
also said oyster creek the nations oldest commercial plant still 
in operation had the secondhighest number incidents of worker 
exposure from 1980 to 1988 among 20 plants considered the nations 
worst oyster creeks 20486 cases of worker exposure trailed only 
the 27701 recorded at pilgrim 1 in plymouth mass 
at the end of work tuesday many of oyster creeks 990 workers 
said they were aware of the risks of working at a nuclear plant 
but do not believe they are in any greater danger than their 
counterparts nationwide 
they brainwash you to make it sound like its dangerous 
said jeff manning who has worked at oyster creek for three months 
this place doesnt bother me a bit said roger mengle a 
waretown man who has handled hazardous materials at the plant since 
june before that he worked for eight years at three mile island 
in middletown pa which was the site of the nations worst 
commerical nuclear accident 
this is my job mengle said 
some oyster creek workers said they chose to work in the nuclear 
industry because of the high pay 
theres better money to be made here said martin 
oyster creek spokesman sandy polon said he would not divulge the 
range of salaries at the plant 
karl neddenien another plant spokesman said the report was 
needlessly alarming 
neddenien did not dispute findings that each worker was exposed 
to an average dose of radiation equivalent to 26 chest xrays but 
argued that nonplant workers in ocean county receive naturally 
occurring background radiation that is more than 40 percent of that 
figure 
neddenien said that although oyster creek which began producing 
electricity in 1969 had more exposures than the nations other 
commerical nuclear plants the level was well within federal 
standards for total exposure 
neddenien also said the stations older design required more 
employees to work in a more compact area exposing them more 
frequently 
working in a nuclear power plant entails possible exposure to 
radiation neddenien said its certainly not a surprise 
he said officials are trying to reduce the number of worker 
exposures by installing permanent scaffolding inside the plants 
dry well to prevent workers from spending extra time setting it up 
before repairs he also said more radiation shielding is being 
installed 
harry sharma of toms river a nuclear engineer for nine years 
said the exposure to radiation was relative 
if you fly on a plane you get radiation it doesnt mean you 
dont fly were still within the limits and the limits are 
artifically low he said 
oyster creek is a subsidiary of general public utilities corp 
of parsippany it is operated by gpu nuclear corp and owned by 
jersey central power amp light which gets power from oyster creek 
for about 200000 of its 800000 customers

president bush spurned appeals from 
balticamerican leaders wednesday to recognize the renegade 
government in lithuania he declared support for its struggle for 
independence but voiced concern about the impact on the soviet 
union 
our policy we believe is the correct one and it does not 
involve recognition white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said 
anthony mazeika director of the baltic american freedom league 
said we are disappointed with the official policy of the united 
states not to recognize the government of lithuanian president 
vytautas landsbergis 
mazeika had urged bush to extend de facto recognition of 
landsbergis government one step short of formal recognition 
bush met for more than an hour with 13 balticamericans 
representing the interests of lithuania estonia and latvia which 
were forcibly incorporated into the soviet union in 1940 
members of the group said they had been seeking a meeting with 
bush since january recognizing that a crisis was looming in 
lithuanias drive to secede from the soviet union and moscows 
refusal to let it go 
we have a lot of very good contacts on the lower and 
midlevels of the state department its just the white house we 
havent been able to penetrate said mariann rikken of the 
estonianamerican national council we used to wear out the 
threshold of the previous administration 
yet members of the group said the mere fact that bush met with 
them will be seen in the baltic states as a positive step 
ms rikken said mr bush had a failure with china he does 
not want to see a similar kind of thing happen in the baltic states 
hes very concerned she added he wants to find a way 
out a way out of the soviet union for the baltic states that will 
not result in a cataclysm for the soviet union and that will not 
result in a blood bath for the baltic states 
fitzwater said bush told the group the us must avoid taking 
actions that would inadvertently make lithuanias task more 
difficult by inflaming the situation and stressed the importance 
of quiet diplomacy 
bush said he did not want to see a situation akin to 1956 when 
the united states encouraged hungarys revolt for democracy but 
then stood by helplessly as the soviet union crushed the uprising 
with force fitzwater said 
ms rikken said bush was very very worried about what 
happened in hungary and that he kept bringing this up during 
the meeting 
she said our job is to convince him that letting the baltic 
states go could be the best thing that would happen to the soviet 
union 
fitzwater said we believe that our present position is the 
correct one and the president did not indicate that we were willing 
to change our position 
the meeting fell one month after lithuanias march 11 
declaration of independence 
since then the administration has been walking a narrow 
diplomatic line endorsing lithuanias aspirations for 
selfdetermination but refusing to recognize the new government 
while emphasizing that the united states never recognized the 
soviet takeover of the baltic states the administration argues 
that lithuania does not control its own territory 
lithuanias determination to secede has posed a major challenge 
to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who is struggling on 
other fronts to carry out his programs of economic and political 
reforms known as perestroika and openness known as glasnost 
while admonishing moscow not to use force in lithuania bush 
credits gorbachev as a driving force behind the democratic reforms 
in eastern europe and changes within the soviet union 
fitzwater said bush in meeting with the balticamericans 
pointed out in forceful terms that the united states approaches 
this problem with many ramifications to consider 
he did say that we support glasnost and perestroika 
fitzwater said he pointed out that we have had these dramatic 
changes in hungary czechoslovakia and poland and indeed we have 
the atmosphere whereby lithuania could consider its future in a 
different light because of glasnost and perestroika 
fitzwater said bush shared the concerns of the balticamericans 
and reiterated his support for the right of the baltic states to 
selfdetermination 
bush was joined by secretary of state james a baker iii white 
house chief of staff john sununu brent scowcroft the national 
security adviser and others 
the problems that are taking place in lithuania are going to 
multiply threefold said ojars kalnins of the american latvian 
association 
the latvians will be declaring independence in two weeks he 
said estonia is in the same process he said that by the time 
bush meets with gorbachev on may 30 we will have a situation in 
all three republics which is comparable to what is happening 
today in lithuania

polands lawmakers wednesday formally 
ended censorship one of the final relics of four decades of 
communist rule 
the decision by a 2660 vote with eight abstentions was 
largely symbolic censorship has been almost nonexistent since the 
solidarityled government of prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was 
voted in to power last fall 
solidarity deputy juliusz braun said censorship had actually 
allowed slandering with impunity without permitting a person to 
defend himself 
the censorship law allowed the former communist authorities to 
control all kinds of publications and stage and film performances 
preventing criticism of the political system 
many poles turned to underground printing which flourished 
through the 1980s 
solidarity the east blocs first independent trade union 
fought for elimination of censorship since its foundation in 1980

polish president wojciech jaruzelski arrived in 
the soviet union on wednesday and hinted talks would be held on a 
world war ii massacre of poles that still clouds relations between 
the two countries 
jaruzelski said discussions during his fourday official visit 
will focus partly on revealing painful pages in our common 
history he appeared to be referring to the katyn forest massacre 
of thousands of polish officers during world war ii 
moscow has long denied any soviet role in the mass executions 
but there have been recent indications officials might finally 
confirm western historians claims that soviet secret police were 
to blame 
before his departure from warsaw jaruzelski told the polish 
news agency pap he also expected his talks with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev to address changes in eastern europe german 
unification and the status of soviet troops in poland 
jaruzelski arrived wednesday in the ukrainian city of lvov and 
then traveled to the republic capital of kiev 
the visit comes after the weekly moscow news in its march 25 
edition shed light from official soviet records on the katyn 
incident one of the last grisly deeds of the stalin era to be 
touched by gorbachevs policy of glasnost 
it published a twopage spread refuting claims that it was nazi 
invaders who killed the cream of the polish intelligentsia held 
prisoner just south of the western city smolensk other articles 
have called for the truth about katyn but none went so far as to 
document the soviet role in what has become the most painful world 
war ii incident for poles 
most estimates say about 4000 people died at katyn 
hitlers army invaded western poland on sept 1 1939 starting 
world war ii weeks later the red army marched into eastern poland 
and remained there until the germans pushed them out in 1941 
katyn has remained a source of lingering polish mistrust of the 
soviet union a joint polishsoviet commission has investigated the 
massacre but it never came to a final conclusion

when a 231 longshot called landing 
officer burst out of thick fog and across the finish line at delta 
downs spectators and track officials knew right away the horse had 
finished too fast and too far ahead 
it had on wednesday jockey sylvester carmouche was banned from 
racing in louisiana for 10 years accused of taking a fogshrouded 
short cut to win the race 
as my mother use to say i dont know how you spilled the 
milk i just know you spilled it state racing commission member 
jeffrey kallenberg said as he made the motion to suspend carmouche 
the jockey was accused of slipping landing officer out of the 
race near the start on jan 11 waiting until the rest of the 
horses rounded the track and slipping back in ahead of the pack 
near the final turn 
the horse which had a record of only five wins in 53 races won 
by 24 lengths and 12 seconds off the track record in the milelong 
race 
it aint right i know i aint did it i leave it up to my 
lawyers what to do carmouche said after the commissions 71 
vote 
carmouches lawyer kent schaffer said he would appeal to a 
state judge and ask for a stay that would allow the jockey to keep 
racing pending a decision 
carmouche also had declared his innocence after the race but 
track stewards stripped him of his victory and suspended him from 
racing at delta downs for two months 
wednesdays hearing was a continuation of a hearing held a month 
ago to determine whether any more action was to be taken against 
him 
in testimony prior to the vote carmouche insisted that he 
completed the race 
but commission chairman harold thomas noted that two jockeys in 
the race said no horse passed them at any time 
they never noticed me carmouche replied 
commission member jeffrey kallenberg said the panel saw a 
videotape of the race fog obscured details but kallenberg said 
that at no time could carmouches colors or the number 8 on his 
horse be seen 
how can that be that we did not see you asked kallenberg 
i dont know but i know i rode the whole race the camera 
must have missed my horse said carmouche 
track employee jl vincent assigned to count horses at various 
points along the route told commissioners he saw only eight of the 
nine entries pass under the bright lights at the first turn 
i thought maybe one horse had stayed in the starting gate 
he said 
at the final turn however he saw all nine horses including 
no 8 landing officer 
the no 8 horse was ahead and running so fast he looked more 
like a quarter horse said vincent referring to a breed that 
runs faster over shorter distances 
at last months hearing delta downs veterinarian james 
broussard testified that landing officer wasnt breathing heavily 
after the race and that the horses leg wrappings were clean 
in my opinion he didnt appear to have participated in a mile 
race broussard said wednesday under cross examination from 
carmouches defense attorney

consumers shouldnt stop buying potatoes 
because unusually high levels of a pesticide were found on a small 
number of potatoes in a single field the government said wednesday 
a major manufacturer of the aldicarb rhonepoulenc ag co said 
earlier this week it was stopping the sale of the pesticide for use 
on potatoes until it can determine why residue levels were 
unusually high 
the residue levels on a sample of 10 potatoes among about 300 
tested from 26 fields reportedly were nine times the levels allowed 
by the environmental protection agency all 10 potatoes were from a 
single field 
the epa commended the company for voluntarily halting sale of 
the chemical for use on potatoes 
consumers should not be alarmed and they should continue their 
normal consumption of potatoes said the epa adding that the 
advice was endorsed by the food and drug administration and the 
agriculture department 
aldicarb a toxic chemical that causes flulike symptoms 
including nausea headaches and dizziness is used on a broad range 
of fruits and vegetables to control insects mites and nematodes 
the chemical has been under review at the epa for some time for 
its affect on groundwater and agency officials are considering 
whether to examine possible concerns about residues on food 
products 
while we believe the continued use of aldicarb is safe we 
have a responsibility to the public to conduct additional research 
to determine the reasons for the unexplained residue levels 
rhonepoulenc said in a statement 
aldicarb has been used since 1970 on such crops as potatoes 
citrus fruits soybeans peanuts and cotton 
katherine karr of the national coalition against the misuse of 
pesticides said the reports from rhonepoulenc demonstrate the need 
for additional goverment action on the chemical 
the epa should suspend the use of aldicarb until they can 
determine what risk levels there are out there for the food 
supply she said

mario vargas llosa has postponed a decision on 
whether to drop out of a runoff election for president following a 
disappointing showing in the first round associates said wednesday 
the celebrated novelist who put aside his writing two years ago 
to campaign was a strong favorite until a week ago to become 
president of this andean nation 
associates speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed 
wednesday that the writer has considered stepping aside to allow 
alberto fujimori the runnerup in elections sunday to become 
presidentelect 
they said he wanted to save peru suffering from growing rebel 
violence and severe economic problems from two more turbulent 
months of political campaigning 
vargas llosas advisers said he would announce his decision 
monday until then he is spending the easter holidays in seclusion 
at a friends beach home 30 miles south of lima 
manuel dornellas editor of expreso newspaper and a close 
friend of the novelist confirmed in a column wednesday that vargas 
llosa had been planning to announce his resignation tuesday 
afternoon but was pursuaded by advisers to put off a decision until 
monday 
dornellas said vargas llosa was prepared to step aside because 
the people had not given him the majority required for an outright 
victory vargas llosa received 32 percent while fujimori an 
agricultural engineer and former university rector running as an 
independent received nearly 30 percent 
the remaining votes were split between seven candidates 
dornellas said vargas llosa offered fujimori his detailed plan 
of government which 200 economic specialists had composed he said 
the writer also proposed forming a bloc in congress of the two 
candidates supporters to guarantee fujimori congressional backing 
vargas llosa was persuaded to reconsider stepping down because 
his decision might jeopardize the stability of a future fujimori 
government the editor said 
the mandate that fujimori would receive after vargas llosas 
resignation could be questioned in the future opening the doors to 
a possible military coup dornellas wrote 
fujimori was given little chance of making the second round a 
month ago but a late surge in popularity sapped the ranks of 
vargas llosa voters and propelled the japaneseperuvian into second 
place 
the leftofcenter governing aprista party and perus leftist 
parties have indicated they would most probably support fujimori in 
the second round that would make a vargas llosa victory unlikely 
vargas llosas democratic front a centerright coalition also 
fell far short of a majority in the congressional elections sunday 
news reports suggested vargas llosa may not be interested in 
leading the government without control of congress 
without congressional support he would have great problems 
imposing the harsh austerity measures he advocates to revive perus 
moribund economy

consignment impounded tuesday night on a dock in northeastern 
england included parts for a 131foot gun barrel apparently the 
largest of its type ever made 
it is capable of firing a nuclear shell which could easily hit 
iran or any other middle east trouble spot from iraq press 
association quoted an unidentified customs and excise office 
spokesman as saying 
no one was arrested the news agency said 
press association said the massive cylinder was manufactured by 
sheffield forgemasters of sheffield 
british broadcasting corp television quoted a company spokesman 
as saying that if the impounded material was indeed made by 
sheffield forgemasters it was a petroleum pipe not a gun barrel 
on march 28 customs authorities seized american components for 
nuclear bomb triggers and arrested five people in a case that 
aggravated western worries about iraqs military capabilities and 
plans 
customs officials confirmed the goods were stopped last 
night we intercepted a consignment of goods being loaded upon a 
ship that was destined for iraq a ship that had been chartered by 
the iraqi maritime services the goods appear to be of a military 
nature a customs spokesman said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
on wednesday morning customs officers raided offices in 
sheffield and birmingham and took away papers relevant to the 
specifications ordering and delivery arrangements for this piece 
of equipment the spokesman said 
press association quoted the customs spokesman as saying we 
are considering the possibility that the gun was made to order in 
britain for the iraqis 
the agency said the parts were packed in eight crates on the 
dock at middlesbrough 
the shipment impounded tuesday was about to be loaded on the 
bermudaregistered gur mariner press association said it will not 
be formally seized unless it is positively identified as containing 
weapon parts press association said 
it is certainly the biggest gun barrel we have ever uncovered 
in this country the customs spokesman said according to the 
agency 
the largest gun built previously was the us high altitude 
research project gun with barrels 119 feet long according to the 
guinness book of records 
there was no immediate reaction to the impoundment wednesday 
from iraq 
after the march 28 seizure the iraqi government denied 
involvement in the alleged smuggling iraq has also denied it seeks 
to develop nuclear weapons 
however earlier this month iraqi president saddam hussein 
threatened to attack israel with binary chemical weapons if it 
attacks iraqi installations 
that threat along with the smuggling case in britain brought a 
chorus of antiiraqi criticism from western governments and news 
media 
iraqi officials have accused western governments of deliberately 
orchestrating the campaign to prepare for an israeli attack 
british relations with iraq have also been soured by iraqs 
hanging march 15 of an iranianborn journalist based in britain he 
was accused of spying

the man accused of starting a nightclub fire 
that killed 87 people in the deadliest us blaze in 13 years 
pleaded innocent wednesday to 174 murder charges and other counts 
julio gonzalez guarded by four marshals and speaking through a 
spanish translator mumbled no culpable when asked how he 
pleaded to the charges during his arraignment in the borough of the 
bronx 
gonzalez 36 is accused of setting the march 25 fire that raced 
through the happy land social club trapping most patrons on the 
second floor of the tiny illegal establishment and killing 87 
people mostly honduran immigrants only five people escaped the 
deadliest blaze since a 1977 nightclub fire in southgate ky 
a grand jury indicted gonzalez on double murder charges for each 
victim one for murder by arson and the other for murder by 
depraved indifference he also was charged with two counts of arson 
and one each of assault and attempted murder 
at the time there was speculation that gonzalez could be 
sentenced to several thousand years in prison if convicted on all 
charges 
but state judge burton r roberts said wednesday that gonzalez 
could be sentenced to only one term of 25 years to life and might 
be eligible for parole in 25 years even if convicted on all murder 
charges roberts said that under state law when there are two or 
more victims from a single crime sentences must run concurrently 
rather than consecutively as in separate crimes 
the judge acknowledged that the social club fire was a special 
case but said he wanted to dispel misconceptions about a possible 
penalty 
roberts set the next court appearance for april 25 i 
understand were a long way from trial the judge said 
gonzalez is undergoing a psychiatric evaluation at bellevue 
hospital 
assistant district attorney eric warner gave gonzalez 
courtappointed attorney richard w berne transcripts of a 
videotaped statement in which gonzalez according to police admits 
setting the fire after a fight with a former girlfriend working at 
the club warner said he would also give berne the videotape to 
copy 
berne said he planned to move for dismissal of all charges on 
grounds he was not given access to the taped statement before 
having to decide whether his client should testify before the grand 
jury gonzalez did not appear before the panel 
berne conceded his motion to dismiss even if granted was a 
procedural matter and that the prosecution would be sure to 
request a new indictment of gonzalez

rights abuses against ethnic albanians in kosovo 
kosovo province an administrative part of the serbian republic

serbian authorities say kosovos mainly christian slav minority 
is harassed and terrorized by ethnic albanians who are 
predominantly moslem 
rep steny hoyer dmd said serbias communist leader slobodan

albanian alternative movements describing them as separatist and 
terrorist

the senior nicaraguan contra 
commander announced wednesday that his rebels will not give up 
fighting until sandinistas in nicaraguas military bow to civilian 
rule 
it was the harshest statement yet by contra leader israel 
galeano since his subordinates signed an agreement with aides of 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro to disarm by her april 
25 inauguration 
there was no immediate response by the outgoing sandinista 
government in managua but it has said the refusal of the contras 
to disband could threaten the transition 
galeano said in an interview that he will refuse to turn over 
arms to peacekeeping forces of the united nations or the 
organization of american states until true democracy emerges in 
nicaragua 
mrs chamorro defeated the sandinistas in elections but i 
believe she will not be able to impose her authority on the 
sandinistas once she takes office galeano said and if she 
doesnt there will be no democracy in nicaragua 
he said from the mountains in nicaragua armed and at the head 
of my troops i shall observe the process of demilitarizing the 
sandinista army 
galeano said his rebel army will honor its commitments and 
will abandon its camps in honduras on april 18 but the army of 
resistance will continue fighting in the mountains inside nicaragua 
until there is true democracy in our nation 
mrs chamorros ussupported coalition of 14 parties won 
elections feb 25 by a landslide ending a decade of leftist 
sandinista rule 
but the sandinistas have insisted the contras which they have 
been fighting for nine years demobilize immediately while the 
sandinista peoples army except for its uppermost ranks remain 
intact 
about 9000 armed contras have infiltrated back into nicaragua 
in recent weeks leaving behind 1000 wounded rebels and stragglers 
with old firearms at their base camps at the honduran border town 
of yamales 
on monday the contras and mrs chamorros representatives 
agreed to start dismantling their yamales camps april 18 under the 
supervision of un and oas peacekeepers 
the rest of the contras were also expected to rally in safety 
zones inside nicaragua to surrender their weapons and disband 
once the international peacekeepers arranged ceasefires with 
sandinista troops 
contra spokesman alejandro acevedo announced in tegucigalpa he 
and six other members of a special rebel commission including 
three civilians will go to managua on monday to try to negotiate a 
truce to the fighting 
we are going to negotiate a definite ceasefire he said 
acevedo said the commission will meet with roman catholic 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo mrs chamorro and officials of her 
united national opposition but not with the sandinistas 
galeano said only the rebels who remain in honduras will 
surrender their weapons 
oscar sovalbarro another contra commander also urged 
sandinista military officers to step down it is important that 
all the high officers leave their positions in the popular 
sandinista army he told radio catolica the roman catholic 
church station 
under a transition protocol that sandinistas and uno signed 
march 27 mrs chamorro promised to respect the integrity and 
professionalism of the armed forces but prohibited all senior 
officers from holding positions of leadership in any political 
parties 
the protocol was a compromise that allows the sandinistas to 
retain control of the army while giving it at least a semblance of 
political neutrality 
the contras contend the army will remain a branch of the 
sandinista party

kentuckys governor signed a bill wednesday making unprecedented 
changes in the administration of his states struggling schools 
and mississippis governor approved nearly 1 billion in aid to the 
nations lowestrated school system 
in frankfort ky gov wallace wilkinson said the bill which 
turns the state into a national laboratory for school reform was 
as significant as drafting the state constitution 
the 1000page statute establishes a minimum spending level of 
2900 for each of kentuckys 570000 students under the old 
system spending varied from 1800 to 4200 a year per student 
depending on a districts wealth 
in the new system geography is a subject to be taught not a 
factor that determines the quality of a childs education said 
wilkinson who said he had been a victim of unequal educational 
opportunity as a child 
the measure raises taxes by about 13 billion over the next two 
years about half the money goes to school reform 
it also eliminates grades for the youngest students and calls 
for committees of parents teachers and principals to make 
daytoday decisions on running schools 
in jackson miss gov roy mabus signed a bill committing 182 
million to improve public school curricula over the next three 
years and another calling for nearly 800 million in bonds to 
replace aging school buildings and buses he called the package 
farreaching and visionary 
but mabus said hed call a special legislative session june 18 
because lawmakers didnt fund the program during their regular 
session which ended friday all of us had a mandate from the 
people to significantly improve the way we educate our children 
he said 
kentuckys law was spurred by a state supreme court ruling last 
june that the states public school system was inequitable and 
unconstitutional and followed nearly a year of political 
wrangling the state has the lowest percentage of high school 
graduates in the nation 
wilkinson signed the bill at the frankfort civic center as 
hundreds of schoolchildren shipped in for the occasion looked on 
the governor said other states face the same sort of court 
orders to restructure their school systems once they see what we 
have accomplished they are sure to follow he said 
in recent years courts have ordered 11 states including 
kentucky to overhaul inequitable school finance systems the 
others are new jersey kansas wisconsin california connecticut 
washington west virginia wyoming arkansas and montana 
in mississippi students have consistently scored lowest in the 
nation on standardized achievement tests although their 
performance has improved since a series of school reforms adopted 
in 1982 
in addition to curriculum improvements the new reform package 
provides for programs to fight illiteracy teenage pregnancy and 
dropouts in the 505000student public school system 
the immediate challenge is finding the money to pay for the 
program mabus proposed a lottery to fund about a third of the 
reform package introduced in august but the senate killed the 
lottery and attempts to revive it mabus rejected the idea of a tax 
increase 
its going to be a difficult task but i think the legislature 
is committed to funding the programs state sen irb benjamin 
who heads the senate education committee said wednesday 
the package calls for the state to finance all curriculum 
improvements and issue bonds to pay for new buildings and buses 
local districts would repay 80 percent of the money borrowed for 
construction projects and 20 percent of the funds for improving 
transportation

ann richards who won the democratic 
nomination in a mudslide and republican clayton williams 
still stinging from criticism after a joke about rape promised to 
stick to issues as they vied for governor 
both clayton williams and i will work very hard to keep this 
an ideological campaign where we really do focus on the issues 
because we do have disagreements on the issues ms richards said 
after defeating state attorney general jim mattox in tuesdays 
downanddirty primary runoff 
williams who earlier voiced reluctance about running against a 
woman said the rehash of the democratic campaign is of no 
interest to me read my lips no more mud 
there was little discussion of the issues in the runoff in 
which mattox alleged that ms richards a recovering alcoholic 
used illegal drugs including cocaine 10 years ago when she was a 
travis county commissioner 
the voters didnt care about that issue as deeply as i do or 
as deeply as i thought they did mattox who had called the 
runoff a referendum on the drug question told an austin news 
conference wednesday afternoon 
ms richards said the issue of whether she has used illegal 
drugs was put to rest after her overwhelming runoff victory 
ms richards 56 now state treasurer accused mattox 46 of 
profiting from public service and challenged him to release his 
income tax returns 
the last week of the campaign brought newspaper reports that 
mattox was seen smoking marijuana in the mid1970s and that ms 
richards was seen in a restroom where marijuana allegedly was being 
smoked in 1979 both dismissed the reports 
they also accused the each other of starting the mudslinging 
but ms richards said her victory showed that mattoxs negative 
campaigning turned off voters 
she handed mattox his first major political defeat in 18 years 
rolling up a margin of 639126 or 57 percent to mattoxs 479384 
or 43 percent in unofficial returns 
mattox said wednesday that he was defeated because of a growing 
trend of women being elected to higher office regardless of their 
credentials he said ms richards enjoyed the support of a 
readymade nationwide network of feminists despite his strong 
advocacy of civil rights and womens issues 
in a separate news conference ms richards claimed support from 
both men and women 
i never felt that women support women simply because theyre 
women she said 
slightly more than 15 percent of the states 83 million 
registered voters cast ballots in the runoff the highest runoff 
turnout since 2 million texans went to the polls in 1972 said 
secretary of state george bayoud turnout in the march 13 primary 
was 28 percent 
voters attention was taken off the runoff briefly when 
williams a rancher and oilman in midland told reporters during 
his spring cattle roundup that bad weather was like rape if its 
inevitable relax and enjoy it 
williams 58 who has never run for political office apologized 
for the comment but ms richards said it illustrated his 
inexperience in public life 
aside from promising not to raise taxes both candidates are at 
opposite ends on most issues including abortion rights ms 
richards is prochoice williams opposes abortion except in cases 
of rape incest and endangerment of the mother 
the victor in novembers election will not have an easy task 
courtordered education reforms according to current proposals 
will cost anywhere from 4 billion to 10 billion during the next 
governors term and the state welfare agency is projecting a 550 
million deficit next year 
mattox and his supporters say they will forget the runoff 
mudbath and rally behind ms richards 
i want to send a sincere congratulations to ann richards 
said mattox who has won every political race he has entered since 
1972 including the state house congress and attorney general 
i will be ready to help her up and down the state against the 
common enemy and the common enemy is clayton williams he said 
incumbent republican bill clements 72 is not seeking 
reelection

have fired the shots 
ive told them and told them no violence no violence 
mcculley said 
authorities said simes and lewis who were arrested tuesday are 
suspects in another bus shooting in south st louis county earlier 
the same morning as the illinois incident 
according to an affidavit by us bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms agent stephen higgins simes admitted he and lewis were

schmieder said in an interview this week that the company 
projects revenue in the next few days will be between 70 percent

the obsessed fan who stalked and nearly 
killed actress theresa saldana eight years ago was scheduled for 
parole wednesday but he was kept in prison for threatening her 
again a prosecutors spokesman said 
if he had been a good little boy and not threatened theresa 
saldana while in prison he would have been a free man today 
said mike botula news secretary for the district attorneys office 
arthur jackson 54 was convicted of attempted murder and 
assault with a deadly weapon in the march 15 1982 attack on miss 
saldana he attacked the actress outside her apartment stabbing 
her 10 times and bending the blade of his kitchen knife with the 
force of his blows 
his 12year sentence had been cut in half for good behavior 
jackson was being held at the mens central jail without bail 
wednesday pending trial on 16 felony counts of menacing miss 
saldana and her rescuer jeff fenn botula said 
jackson could enter pleas to the new charges as early as friday 
when a preliminary hearing is scheduled botula said 
the prisoner was transferred last month from the california 
medical facility in vacaville to county custody for a march 15 
arraignment which was postponed because he didnt have an 
attorney botula said 
deputy district attorney william w hodgman said jackson still 
poses a danger to the actress it is evident he still has a 
fixation on theresa saldana the prosecutor said 
the latest charges were based on seven letters sent to miss 
saldana and fenn a former water deliveryman who rescued her in 
front of her west hollywood apartment and held jackson for police 
fenn is now a sheriffs deputy 
the general tone of the letters was he was making special 
demands and if she didnt meet those demands he would have her 
assassinated hodgman said refusing to elaborate 
jackson a scottish drifter with a history of mental problems 
entered the united states illegally in 1982 to stalk miss saldana 
authorities said he became obsessed with her after watching her 
films including raging bull and i want to hold your hand 
jackson is charged with eight counts of threatening to use force 
and eight of making terrorist threats in letters 
the charges carry a maximum seven years and eight months in 
prison but if convicted jackson faces sentencing under provisions 
of a 1986 state law that bars freeing deranged inmates who continue 
to make credible threats 
the law inspired by the saldana case makes it a crime for a 
convicted felon to threaten a victim or witness 
authorities learned weeks before his scheduled release last june 
that jackson had allegedly sent the letters at the same time as 
charges were filed in los angeles prison authorities tacked 270 
more days onto his sentence for three custody violations including 
breaking prison windows

soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze has expressed interest in dual natowarsaw pact 
membership for a united germany according to an article to be 
published next month 
shevardnadze also said he foresaw a security arrangement among 
europe the soviet union and north america that eventually would 
replace both military alliances 
many of our experts believe that the idea of dual 
membership for germany could provide a pragmatic way out of the 
difficulties emerging now shevardnadze wrote in a piece for the 
may issue of natos sixteen nations it is an independent magazine 
covering international security issues 
i would favor a serious and thorough analysis of this 
option he said 
but the bush administration on wednesday rejected the idea of a 
united germanys temporarily being part of both nato and the warsaw 
pact and insisted germany would have to side with the western 
alliance 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said that 
germany should be a member of nato and the warsaw pact is another 
formula for neutrality it is a status that we believe the germans 
themselves and their neighbors believe is undesirable we strongly 
support full membership of a united germany in nato 
we are opposed to neutrality 
last week in washington us officials said the soviet union 
dropped its demand that a unified germany be militarily neutral it 
continued to oppose membership in the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
west germany is a nato member east germany is in the 
sovietdominated warsaw pact 
the soviet foreign minister wrote that dual membership proposal 
would help overcome further the division of europe contribute to 
its unification and create integrated spaces in it the article 
was made available wednesday to the associated press 
reacting to the article nato spokesman florent swijsen said the 
16nation western alliance remains opposed to dual membership 
the allies are not considering the possibility of a unified 
germany being part of both nato and the warsaw pact he said in a 
statement even several members of the latter warsaw pact have 
indicated their preference for a united germany as a member of 
nato 
nato officials have said that after unification soviet troops 
could be temporarily stationed in what is now east germany 
shevardnadze said in his article that the kremlin believed 
germany should become a military nonaligned state and a 
demilitarized state in the sense that it ought to possess the 
lowest possible military capability sufficient for defense 
at the same time we hold that in the final analysis germany 
should be a fully equal member of todays family of nations and 
become a state like all other states he wrote 
he suggested the new state declare that it will not have 
nuclear chemical or other weapons of mass destruction 
the soviet official outlined his view of how a greater 
europe security structure should look based on the 35nation 
conference on security and cooperation in europe the 35 nations 
the united states canada and all in europe except albania will 
hold a summit later this year 
he suggested the organization hold summit meetings of national 
leaders every two years with foreign ministers gathering yearly as 
the top political body 
europe is heading for a new status in terms of its instruments 
of security shevardnadze wrote if and when the blocs vanish 
into thin air and the process must not be artificially boosted 
no vacuum should be allowed to form

a jury wednesday began deliberating 
whether former sunday school teacher john e list was a hideous 
angel of death or was mentally disturbed when he killed his wife 
three children and mother 
lists attorney elijah l miller jr has conceded during the 
eightday trial that list 64 committed the killings 19 years ago 
but he sought a lesser verdict of seconddegree murder 
firstdegree murder as sought by the prosecution required the 
union county superior court jury to find that list acted with 
premeditation it carries a life term with parole eligibility in 
15 years seconddegree murder has a 30year maximum with parole 
possible after a third of the term 
the jurors deliberated for six hours then recessed until 
thursday morning before stopping they asked for a rereading of 
the judges instructions on the element of firstdegree murder 
willfullness deliberation and premeditation 
authorities found the bodies of lists wife helen 45 mother 
alma 84 daughter patricia 16 and sons john 15 and frederick 
13 in their 18room westfield mansion on dec 7 1971 
miller argued that list a pious and strictly raised lutheran 
was watching his whole world falling to pieces when an 
obsessivecompulsive personality disorder combined with 
twisted religious belief forced him to act 
list was beset by pressures couldnt provide for his family 
after a series of job failures and saw his family slipping from 
the church miller said he was also oppressed by the irrational 
behavior of his wife who suffered from terminal syphilis 
list ruled out suicide because that would ensure his damnation 
miller argued killing his children ensured their entry into 
heaven he said 
he looked to religion for an answer and he corrupted that 
answer said miller 
eleanor clark an assistant prosecutor argued that list acted 
as a hideous angel of death weighing the options right up until 
the night before killing his family 
the state says today mr list have you no shame she 
shouted stalking toward the defense table her index finger raised 
miller relied on testimony by psychiatric witnesses and five 
ministers from lists past the state presented 41 witnesses in 2 
days most of them investigators forensic experts and 
acquaintances who traced lists actions the day of the slayings 
list said he shot his victims in the back of the head to spare 
them knowledge that they were about to die mrs clark told the 
court but she reminded the juors of autopsy reports that showed 
the bullets entered the side of the heads 
the younger john list was shot more than 10 times because he 
struggled list wrote in a letter to his pastor evidence indicated 
that john surprised his father that day and knew something was 
wrong 
his father his loving father took a 9mm gun and a 22 and 
riddled his body with bullets she said 
on the day of the slayings list wrapped up his affairs in a 
meticulous manner he cleaned the house ate meals before and after 
the killings washed the dishes left instructions on the funerals 
and his financial affairs and withdrew money from the bank 
authorities said 
the next day he dropped his car off at john f kennedy 
international airport in new york and zigzagged across the country 
by train until settling in denver because he liked mountains list 
told prosecution psychiatrist steven s simring 
simring testified that list told him he expected to be caught 
early on and constantly thought of the killings in the first year 
as he resumed another identity and remarried the memory faded 
returning only on the anniversary of the killings simring said 
list an accountant who later moved to the richmond va area 
was arrested in june after the killings were dramatized on a 
television crime show and a viewer tipped authorities

a strong earthquake jolted western japan thursday 
morning but no damage or injuries were reported the central 
meteorological agency said 
the earthquake which had a preliminary reading of 63 on the 
richter scale occurred 222 miles underground in the southwestern 
part of fukui prefecture state the agency said fukui is 200 
miles west of tokyo 
an official of the agencys seismic division said shock waves 
from an earthquake originating so deep underground largely 
dissipate before reaching the surface and rarely cause damage said 
the official who declined to be identified 
on wednesday afternoon an earthquake measuring 55 struck 
kushiro and neighboring areas on japans northernmost major island 
of hokkaido but police said there were no reports of injuries or 
damage 
that quake ocurred about 40 miles undersea off kushiro which is 
540 miles north of tokyo 
the openended richter scale is a gauge of the energy released 
by an earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph every increase of one number on the scale means a 
tenfold increase in magnitude 
an earthquake of 5 on the richter scale can cause considerable 
damage in populated areas a quake measuring 6 is considered severe 
and capable of widespread damage near the epicenter

leaking hydrogen gas fueled a fire and explosion 
that shut down an oilfired generator at the troubled turkey point 
power plant complex wednesday utility officials said no one was 
injured 
two nuclear power plants and another oilfired plant at turkey 
point were not affected spokesmen said the fire was confined to 
an enclosure housing an exciter a small auxiliary generator 
plant operators took the unit 2 generator off line when they 
detected a loss of hydrogen pressure and the fire was discovered 
in the exciter about 15 minutes later said florida power amp light 
co spokesman gary mehalik 
the hydrogen is used to cool the generator 
the visible damage is very very moderate said fpl 
spokesman dale thomas 
the plants fire brigade had to put out the fire twice because 
the highly flammable hydrogen continued leaking and exploded a 
second time he said 
it has an invisible flame but it is searing hot said joe 
jenkins director of the state public service commissions electric 
and gas division 
the hydrogen leaked from the sealed room where the gas cools the 
spinning generator passed through a turbine shaft and into the 
shedsized exciter enclosure mehalik said 
utility workers will have to remove the generator housing on 
unit 2 to determine the extent of damage and the cost of repairs 
and that will take a day or two thomas said 
unit 2 was the only one operating at turkey point at the time of 
the fire which left the 2090megawatt plant idle idefinitely 
one nuclear unit and one oilfired unit were down for scheduled 
maintenance and the other nuclear unit automatically shut down 
monday when an electrical relay failed in an unrelated incident 
the loss of turkey points generating capacity was not 
considered crucial because fpl could boost the power generated at 
other plants or turn on idle units elsewhere in its system 
fpl declared an unusual event at the nuclear plant wednesday 
for almost two hours even though the fire did not affect the 
nuclear side of the operation mehalik said the nuclear regulatory 
commission designation is the lowest emergency classification 
the plants nuclear units have been derided by consumer groups 
as among the most unsafe nationally with a history of security 
lapses and poor training 
the utility responded by launching a major qualitycontrol 
improvement program and won japans most prestigious quality award 
last october the nrc took the plant off its watch list earlier 
this year 
miamibased fpl is floridas largest utility serving 3 million 
customers from key west almost to jacksonville 
the power plant complex is in an unpopulated area on the edge of 
biscayne bay about 30 miles south of downtown miami

about 150 jews moved into the christian sector 
of jerusalems old city wednesday sparking arab outrage at the the 
first jewish presence in the area in 54 years arab and israeli 
sources said 
angry christian arabs threw stones at the settlers and greek 
orthodox bishops arrived at the site to question the legality of 
the move arab sources said 
there were no reports of injuries and police spokesman uzi 
sandori could not confirm any violence 
settler shifra blass a spokeswoman for the ataraot cohanim 
yeshiva or jewish seminary said the families moved into a 
building in the christian quarter as part of an effort to expand 
the jewish presence in arab areas 
we are doing the worthwhile job of advancing the avowed 
government policy of jewish settlement throughout the city blass 
said 
mahdi abdul hadi director of an arab think tank on foreign 
policy in east jerusalem said the settlers were escalating the 
confrontation by provoking palestinians in their daily life 
they are threatening the present and future existence of the 
palestinians in this city he said 
benny elon an official at the seminary said the institute 
legally purchased the building in the christian quarter in a secret 
deal with an arab resident he would not say when the purchase was 
made 
officials at the greek orthodox church said the building is 
church property and was illegally acquired 
sandori said a police investigation concluded that the purchase 
was legal 
almost 50000 moslems live in the old city along with 7000 
christians and approximately 4000 jews 
more than 3000 of those jews live in the jewish quarter the 
moslem quarter is home to 40 jewish families and two seminaries 
including ataraot cohanim 
the twostory building under question is near the jewish quarter 
and is in an area that was a thriving jewish commercial center in 
the nineteenth century 
the jews living in that commercial center fled in 1936 after a 
series of arab riots 
israel captured the old city along with the west bank from 
jordan in the 1967 arab israeli war the government annexed the old 
city shortly after the war and called the unified city israels 
eternal and indivisible capital 
the capital has not escaped the violence that has surged through 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip since the palestinian 
uprising began in december 1987 
six arabs and four israelis have been killed in jerusalem as a 
result of uprisingrelated incidents 
the latest attack was friday when an unidentified assailant 
stabbed a 35yearold yeshiva student living in the moslem quarter 
slightly wounding him

hungarys ambassador said wednesday his 
government has instructed soviet authorities to stop letting jewish 
emigres go to israel via budapest until the backlog is cleared of 
those already holding tickets 
ambassador erno simonyi estimated it could take months before up 
to 2500 ticketed soviet jews are transported to tel aviv 
reacting to threats from palestinian extremists hungarys 
national airline malev announced last month it would transport no 
more soviet jews to israel hungary later reversed the announcement 
for scheduled flights and fired malevs manager but a ban remained 
on charter flights for soviet jews 
simonyi told reporters the hungarian airline is now taking 
without discrimination any nationals including soviet jews but we 
arent taking any new passengers until those who already have 
tickets are transported 
they are about 20002500 so it will take several weeks 
probably months 
he said hungarian authorities also told the soviet carrier 
aeroflot not to issue tickets on malev flights from budapest to tel 
aviv 
simonyi apparently chose to address the issue in cairo to 
emphasize that the decision to continue flying soviet jews to 
israel should not affect hungarys relations with arab countries 
as in the rest of the arab world emigration to israel of 
thousands of soviet jews has caused an uproar in egypt the only 
arab country at peace with the jewish state 
simonyi said some 1000 soviet jews have used the 
budapesttel aviv route since it opened last fall 
palestinians and arab governments fear a large influx of new 
israelis will settle in lands israel captured from jordan and egypt 
in the 1967 middle east war 
israeli officials say they expect up to 750000 soviet jewish 
immigrants by the end of the decade

new york city and state sued the federal 
government on wednesday in an effort to boost an expected 
undercount of minorities in the 1990 census which they claim uses 
biased and unconstitutional guidelines 
the legal action was joined by the cities of chicago los 
angeles and houston dade county fla the state of california 
the us conference of mayors the league of cities the naacp and 
the league of united latin american citizens 
mayor david dinkins calling the undercount of urban minorities 
a national disgrace said that problem and other factors would 
mean cities across the country will once again lose hundreds of 
millions of dollars in federal aid and dozens of seats in 
congress 
yet the national government from the white house to the 
commerce department to the census bureau seems to want to pay it 
no mind they have gotten away with statistical malfeasance for 200 
years and figure they can get away with it for another 10 
the lawsuit filed against the department of commerce in us 
district court asks judge joseph mclaughlin to invalidate the 
census bureaus biased and unconstitutional guidelines for 
adjusting the expected undercount of minorities dinkins said 
around the country more than 23 million of the 885 million 
census forms mailed out to households could not be delivered the 
mayor said in addition 250000 of them designated for delivery to 
residents in the new york city boroughs of brooklyn and queens had 
been kept in the bureaus indiana warehouse he said 
the city maintains it was undercounted by 450000 people in the 
1980 census and subsequently lost one congressman one state 
senator and one state assemblyman as well as 657 million in 
federal aid which was based on population 
in a statement census director barbara everitt bryant called 
the timing of the lawsuit particularly unfortunate 
today we are stretching all available resources to ensure that 
every american is counted in the census there is time enough later 
to litigate the adequacy of this effort she said 
former city corporation counsel peter zimroth who is serving as 
attorney on the lawsuit said the city and state are seeking to 
overturn guidelines set forth by the commerce department last month 
concerning the accuracy of this years count 
the commerce department has claimed the right to decide whether 
the censuss raw figures are right or whether a postcensus survey 
sampling should be conducted as the mayor and others have urged 
commerce has said it has the right to reject a survey even 
though the survy might be more accurate on grounds that it would 
unduly disrupt the transfer of political power in the united 
states since census figures are used to determine electoral 
districts zimroth said 
zimroth complained that means the department of commerce 
would decide what is fair representation 
the departments undersecretary for economic affairs michael r 
darby defended his agencys efforts 
the guidelines are designed to ensure that we have the most 
accurate census possible and to prevent manipulation of the census 
figures for political purposes darby said in a statement 
mayor jimmy kemp of meridian miss a member of the census task 
force of the united states conference of mayors joined dinkins in 
the press conference in city hall and said he too expected an 
undercount and urged that an adjustment be made based on a 
postcensus survey 
all persons count and all persons should be counted whether 
in meridian miss or new york city he said the overriding 
issue is one of fairness

kuwaits islamic theologians ruled that buying 
oysters on the chance they could bear pearls was sinful and a 
newspaper said wednesday that the decision led to the closure of a 
decadesold oyster market 
the daily alqabas said the formal prohibition came after a 
citizen approached the ministry of endowment and islamic affairs 
for an opinion on the practice 
islamic experts told the associated press that the practice was 
considered tantamount to gambling banned by the moslem religion 
the sale of pearls before cracking the oyster is illegal 
because only almighty god knows if it includes pearls or not 
they quoted sheik mishaal mubarak alsabah head of the islamic 
judgment department as saying 
the newspaper explained that oysters in kuwait are purchased for 
the sole purpose of searching for pearls and compared the trade to 
a lottery or gambling 
if an oyster is cracked before a sale and sold as food the 
purchase is legal the newspaper said 
smallsize varieties of the marine mollusk are considered a 
delicacy in some mediterranean countries including islamic 
countries the flesh inside the ones sold in kuwait is also eaten 
at times 
according to alqabas the minister of state for municipal 
affairs mohammed alrefai in response to the ruling immediately 
ordered the closure of the oyster market in shuwaikh which has 
been running for decades shuwaikh is six miles north of kuwait 
city 
alqabas said the oyster dealers were protesting the closure of 
the market and petitioning the concerned authorities 
the oyster is sold in bags containing about seven pounds for a 
price ranging from 20 to 155 reports of pearl finds are 
extremely rare 
diving and search for pearls once was a key occupation of 
kuwaitis with the oil era and with the japans development of 
artificial pearls the occupation declined

an inmate who has aids was convicted 
wednesday of attempted murder for biting a sheriffs officer and 
telling him to die you pig 
a jury spent seven hours over two days before announcing its 
conviction of gregory d smith in the june 11 attack on albert 
waddington a camden county corrections officer the panel also 
convicted smith of four counts of aggravated assault and one count 
of making terroristic threats 
the jury acquitted smith on one count each of aggravated assault 
and making terroristic threats in separate incidents involving two 
other officers 
smith showed no emotion when the verdict was read 
waddington 26 who has not tested positive for the aids virus 
clapped his hands and bowed his head as the jury foreman read the 
guilty verdict he quickly left the courthouse and declined 
comment 
smith shouted at the guard as he left telling him on your 
way home waddington stop in church and ask god to forgive you for 
that lie 
he also shouted at superior court judge john b mariano that he 
would appeal and sheriffs officers quickly handcuffed him and led 
him away 
sentencing is scheduled for may 18 smith 26 who is serving a 
fiveyear sentence for a robbery conviction faces a maximum 
sentence of 30 years imprisonment 
smith was indicted for attempted murder in august for biting 
waddington on the hand three times waddington contends smith also 
spat on him and said now die you pig die from what i have 
smith denied biting the guard his attorney said the case was 
generated by aids hysteria and that scratches on the officers 
hands were caused by the jagged edges of smiths handcuffs 
if it wasnt for aids this man would never have been here 
defense attorney ralph kramer said outside the courtroom 
im very happy for al waddington because he went through 
hell said harold kasselman assistant county prosecutor were 
not going to tolerate this kind of conduct on our corrections law 
enforcement officers 
kramer said he would appeal on the contention that the judge 
improperly allowed the jury to consider testimony from a 
prosecution medical expert who said there was a slight possibility 
aids could be transmitted through a bite 
he said medical experts maintain it is very unlikely that the 
virus can be transmitted through contact such as biting or 
spitting the fatal disease is generally transmitted through 
intravenous drug use blood transfusions and sexual contact 
the case is one of about 10 in the country in which an 
aidsstricken individual has been accused of attempting to spread 
the virus through biting or spitting medical and legal experts 
fear it will fuel misconceptions about how the disease is 
transmitted 
what the criminal justice system is doing here is posing a 
very serious crime for a highly improbable result said larry 
gostin executive director of the american society of law and 
medicine and an associate professor at harvards school of public 
health

interior minister salem massadeh said 
wednesday the government next month plans to scrap the 55yearold 
defense law under which martial law has been imposed in jordan 
since 1967 
he said the government will propose a new law for potential 
states of emergency when parliament resumes its sessions early next 
month 
the law will cancel the old law but it will be inactive until 
it is used in emergency cases for the national security of the 
country massadeh told a news conference 
the announcement came as king hussein discussed middle east 
issues wednesday with a senior delegation of us senators led by 
robert dole rkan the senators spent more than three hours with 
hussein after arriving from egypt there were no substantive 
details on the talks 
prime minister mudar badran promised in december to cancel both 
the defense law and martial law within six months 
jordan declared martial law under the 1935 legislation during 
the arabs 1967 war with israel and the country has lived under 
that decree ever since 
but badran this year stripped military courts of most functions 
and returned power to civilian tribunals he declared martial law 
frozen 
both jordan and israel inherited versions of the defense law 
from the british mandate period before world war ii both have used 
it widely 
it provides much of the legal foundation for israels detention 
without trial of thousands of palestinians during the continuing 
uprising on the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
massadeh noted that the many laws and decrees imposed under 
martial law over 23 years often affected routine affairs and he 
said the government is studying which need to be replaced by new 
legislation proposed to parliament 
the action continues a yearlong series of liberalizing reforms 
prompted largely by the april 1989 riots in southern jordan over 
economic problems and what was viewed as government highhandedness 
the parliament that will consider the new legislation was 
elected in november during jordans first nationwide election since 
1967 
jordan has also returned passports confiscated by the general 
intelligence department dropped all travel and work bans and freed 
all of its purely political prisoners according to government 
officials 
massadeh said 31 people convicted of political offenses remain 
in prison but he said all were also convicted of other crimes 
such as possession use or smuggling of arms and explosives or 
attacking security forces 
the us senators meanwhile arranged to fly on to baghdad 
thursday to discuss issues that have strained us relations with 
the iraqi government of president saddam hussein 
the lawmakers ran into protests in amman over a senate 
resolution recognizing jerusalem as israels capital 
a peaceful gathering of about 150 demonstrators including 
several former highranking officials met the senators on their 
return from the palace shortly before midnight to protest the 
senate action 
we feel perfectly dismayed by the march 22 vote former 
foreign minister hazem nuseibeh told dole 
nusibeh and other prominent jerusalem figures gave the senators 
a document outlining their opposition 
dole assured the group the senate action was a nonbinding 
resolution that did not affect us policy which does not 
recognize the disputed holy city as israels capital 
i dont think it has any importance dole said the big 
picture is getting the peace process started 
roughly half jordans 31 million people are from families that 
lost homes in palestine when israel was created or when it captured 
the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan in 1967 
columnist tareq masarweh noted in the daily newspaper al rai 
that that one of the visitors sen howard metzenbaum dohio was 
a sponsor of the jerusalem resolution why should we welcome 
him asked masarweh 
other delegates are sens alan simpson of wyoming james mcclure 
of idaho frank murkowski of alaska and charles grassley of iowa 
all republicans

more than two dozen people canceled 
subscriptions to protest a newspapers decision to fire two editors 
for their leadership roles in an antiabortion group the papers 
editor said wednesday 
fairfield ledger editor jan nierling said she was sorry to lose 
the readers and that every subscription counts but said the 
cancellations had a minimal economic impact the independently 
owned paper has more than 5000 daily subscribers 
we had a couple of letters in protest and well print them 
she said but we also had someone come in last night who renewed 
his subscription and said he was proud that we did what we felt 
we had to do 
a few advertisers including a christian book store had pulled 
ads she said 
we had one call back who said i apologize i thought it 
through and i realize in business there are some tough decisions to 
make ms nierling said 
on monday the paper fired news editor john kennedy and people 
page editor terri lambertsen because they declined to resign from 
their positions as secretary and president of a new antiabortion 
group 
ms nierling said the two violated the papers policy that 
prohibits journalists from taking active positions in groups 
subject to news coverage 
kennedy said no legal action was planned against the paper but 
id like to see this be righted their action is wrong in our 
eyes 
he said the southeast iowa prolifers group has not done 
anything other than hold an organizational meeting 
my beliefs on abortion are not political views its 
religious kennedy said theyre my christian convictions its 
not some political bent im on 
there have been a lot of christians calling offering support 
and prayers he said thats been very encouraging and ive 
got a lot of support from people who arent christians just on the 
principle that its wrong for a paper to fire people for their 
beliefs 
kennedy and ms lambertsen are members of the international 
church of the four square gospel which encourages members to be 
socially active 
ms nierling said she too had received numerous calls of 
support 
she said editors from around iowa called to say the ledger made 
the right decision 
it was nice to have the supportive phone calls she said 
they said it was a tough call that they wouldnt want to be in 
my shoes but they said theyd do the same thing

a swedish woman whose flag was 
removed from a condominium flagpole says shell go to court to 
fight for the right to fly the banner of her native country 
zenta rowley who moved to the united states from sweden five 
years ago hired an attorney after her flag was removed last week 
from the community flagpole at mariner village 
this is ridiculous i like my flag and i know my rights 
said rowley who was given the blueandyellow banner recently by 
friends from sweden 
what she wants to do is something very patriotic that doesnt 
hurt anybody in the neighborhood said her attorney james rich 
the president of the boynton mariner village homeowners 
association mark ifill also is seeking advice from a lawyer he 
refused to respond to rowleys accusation that he was responsible 
for the flags removal 
the swedish flag was taken down a few hours after rowley raised 
it on the complexs flagpole beneath the us flag also on the 
pole are four nautical flags that signify the village association 
rowley said she then collected signatures from 34 of the 36 unit 
owners supporting her effort to fly the flag and checked with 
boynton beach officials to make sure city law doesnt prohibit 
display of foreign flags 
we dont have any problems with it as long as the american 
flag is on top of course code enforcement administrator scott 
blasie said 
but rowley must get permission from her homeowners association 
before the swedish flag can be flown said complex manager gene 
schuler 
it is a shame that you need attorneys for something like this 
but sometimes there is no other choice he said 
if you let the swedes fly their flags then you have to do the 
same for the mexicans and italians which could lead to a lot of 
problems said schuler

a jury has awarded a 28 million libel 
judgment to a heart surgeon who claimed a san antonio television 
station ruined his medical practice with stories of allegations 
that he performed unnecessary surgery 
attorneys for kenstv said they likely will appeal tuesdays 
verdict 
dr sudhir srivastava filed the lawsuit against kenstv and 
hartehanks television in 1985 after the station broadcast a series 
of reports alleging that a ring of physicians had performed 
unnecessary surgery on elderly patients for profit 
the jury found that the reports that the doctor had performed 
such surgery based on interviews with relatives of some of his 
patients were false as a whole and had ruined srivastavas 
reputation 
were elated the doctor with his wife and two children 
said after the verdict finally justice came through 
they saw the truth srivastava said of the jurors they 
saw all the evidence that was there and the facts convinced them 
in the series kenstv journalist ed gonzalez reported that 
srivastava had lost his privileges to practice at santa rosa 
hospital and the baptist memorial hospital system amid claims of 
unnecessary surgery 
the doctor contended the series ruined his san antonio practice 
his malpractice insurance skyrocketed and he was forced to move to 
midland where he now practices at a loss said his lawyer james 
branton 
eleven jurors one more than needed to validate the decision in 
civil court voted to award the doctor 28 million after hearing 
two weeks of evidence and deliberating six hours 
kenstv lawyer mark cannan said an appeal is likely 
adverse jury verdicts against the media are not uncommon 
cannan said but this is just round one 
branton described srivastava as a promising young surgeon who 
had performed more than 2000 openheart surgeries by the end of 
1984 he also claimed the station was out to get someone during 
a ratings period 
kenstv stood behind the broadcast calling it good journalism 
on a subject of great public concern 
cannan argued that the medical community already knew of 
srivastavas hospital suspensions and therefore the doctors 
reputation was damaged before the first kenstv story aired 
he noted the suspensions also were reported in the san antonio 
expressnews the morning before the first broadcast 
cannan said the series ran over a period of several days and 
srivastava had an open invitation to appear on the program 
dallas lawyer chip babcock who represents the dallas times 
herald and kdfwtv in dallas said the verdict is one of the 
biggest libel awards against a texas news organization 
kenstv president and general manager michael j conly said 
the verdict relates to a newscast that ran over five years ago 
we are amazed and very disappointed by it 
at the same time we know media companies frequently lose 
verdicts at the jury level for whatever reasons but then win on 
appeal because the law recognizes the crucial role the media plays 
in educating the public and protecting our democratic 
institutions conly said

harold ballard the colorful and eccentric owner 
of the toronto maple leafs of the national hockey league died 
wednesday in a toronto hospital after a long illness he was 86 
ballard died of a combination of factors including diabetes 
heart problems and kidney and respiratory failure doctors at 
wellesley hospital said in a release 
ballards children harold jr william and mary elizabeth 
flynn and his longtime companion yolanda ballard had visited 
him earlier wednesday 
i was holding his hand said his oldest friend former 
toronto mayor allan lamport who had visited ballard just before he 
died he squeezed my hand it showed he understood 
his death came months after he abruptly called off a scheduled 
marriage on a caribbean island to ms ballard 57 
ballard who owned maple leafs gardens and built a fortune 
estimated at more than 100 million reveled in his reputation for 
being cantankerous and unabashedly sexist and his personality 
often made more headlines than his team 
nhl president john ziegler whom ballard once called a 
knownothing shrimp said his death marked the end of an era 
harold was his own public relations marketing and promotional 
man not only manager but performer 
in an interview in october ballard said i think that every 
girl thinks that if she hangs around with a guy that shes going to 
be his wife someday she isnt getting any headway with me 
when asked about women sportswriters in the locker room he 
said i told them once if you want to go in there you can but 
youve got to take your clothes off too 
ballard called professional hockey players overpaid and often 
criticized warmer soviet relations with the west particularly on 
the ice he once threatened to bar a soviet team from his arena for 
an exhibition match 
in 1972 ballard was convicted of fraud and theft involving 
205000 in the arenas funds and served one year of a threeyear 
sentence 
ballard spent much of the last two years in and out of hospitals 
because of diabetesrelated heart problems in july 1988 he 
underwent heart bypass surgery at toronto general hospital 
in january 1988 he had a heart attack while on vacation and 
spent almost a month in the miami heart institute in february 
1986 ballard spent 16 days in the hospital for prostate gland 
surgery 
perhaps the strangest episode in his soap opera life began in 
1982 when he met yolanda macmillan who in 1987 had her last name 
legally changed to ballard in anticipation of a wedding 
but on jan 3 just hours before the two were to be wed in the 
cayman islands ballard backed out saying he was not ready for 
marriage 
hours later ballard became ill and had been hospitalized since 
a judge in toronto declared ballard mentally incompetent and 
appointed personal and financial guardians 
william ballard referred to ms ballard as the dragon lady 
and said she had taken advantage of his fathers loneliness while 
trying to isolate him from his family 
she responded they were a longbattling family many many 
years before i came to know mr ballard it just breaks my heart to 
see this kind of discontentment 
ballard was born in toronto on july 30 1903 the only son of a 
skating company owner he began in hockey as the owner of a minor 
league team he became vice president of the maple leafs in the 
1960s and president and governor of the club in 1971 he was 
inducted into the hockey hall of fame in 1977 the year the leafs 
celebrated their 50th birthday 
he bought the hamilton tigerscats of the canadian football 
league in 1978 and sold it in 1989 
his wife dorothy died of cancer in 1968

hydrogen gas building up inside nuclear 
waste storage tanks at the hanford nuclear reservation poses no 
risk to the public the head of a congressional review group said 
wednesday 
two members of the defense nuclear facilities safety board have 
spent the past two days at hanford conferring with officials for 
the us department of energy about the tanks experts have said 
there is a chance the tanks could explode because of the hydrogen 
buildup 
we dont believe there is any kind of risk to the public 
said john conway chairman of the board in a brief telephone 
interview 
asked whether the issue has unnecessarily alarmed the public as 
energy secretary james watkins has contended conway said the 
public has a reason to be concerned unless it is explained 
properly to them 
conway spoke after he and board member herbert kouts had eight 
hours of briefings from doe and experts 
hanford manager mike lawrence announced last month that new 
findings indicated hydrogen was building up inside 20 of hanfords 
177 waste storage tanks he said there was a low risk of the 
hydrogen catching fire or exploding 
watkins subsequently criticized lawrence before congress for 
alarming the public over such a low risk 
lawrence has said the problem is that hydrogen is trapped under 
the hard crust that forms at the top of the wastes which are 
byproducts of the production of plutonium for nuclear weapons 
scientists monitoring the wastes have watched them rise as much 
as 33 inches in past years apparently the result of gases building 
up under the crust doe has said 
conway said doe officials must continue taking precautions to 
prevent the tanks from exploding the energy department has stopped 
taking wastes in and out of the tanks and reduced probing 
activities to prevent a spark from triggering an explosion 
there are more things theyll have to do conway said but 
did not elaborate 
the board needs additional information before making its 
recommendations to watkins and will visit hanford again he said 
the safety board was set up by congress last year to monitor 
safety at doe facilities

lech walesa denied wednesday he had 
decided to run for president of poland and said the campaign that 
most concerns him is winning reelection next week as solidarity 
chairman 
walesa backed away from remarks attributed to him tuesday by the 
official polish news agency pap that indicated he would be a 
presidential candidate in the next election 
today on radio and tv i hear that lech walesa agreed to be 
president i didnt say so at all walesa protested i simply 
did not guard my tongue enough somewhere 
walesa said he had been cajoled into giving an answer and 
was misunderstood 
asked about whether he would run for president walesa was 
quoted by pap as replying i confirm 
we have many wise and valuable people in government holding 
various posts walesa told pap however one must speed up the 
pace of reforms and destroy the old arrangements 
on wednesday walesa said his metaphor about running for 
president was simply his way of warning the present solidarityled 
government to work faster in transforming poland from a communist 
to a democratic system 
walesa expressed concern that a premature presidential bid might 
cost him support among solidarity activists who will be electing a 
chairman next week when the onceoutlawed union holds its first 
congress in nine years 
now we have the union elections and a lot of activists will 
say i would vote for you but if you want to jump from the union to 
the presidency i will not vote walesa said speaking to 
reporters during a visit to his gdansk union headquarters by 
czechoslovak deputy premier jan carnogursky 
by this false start i can lose the basic things he said 
referring to the union chairmanship walesa faces a challenge from 
a solidarity faction that feels the union has strayed too far from 
its founding ideals of 1980 by putting politics ahead of trade 
union goals defending workers interests 
despite his denials however other politicians showed little 
doubt wednesday that walesa eventually intends to seek the 
presidency 
president wojciech jaruzelskis sixyear term is not due to end 
until 1995 but there is a strong possibility the election will be 
moved up as part of a general overhaul of the polish constitution 
the fact that walesa intends to run for president of the 
polish republic is not a surprise for me said labor party leader 
wladyslaw silanowicki in wednesdays edition of the government 
newspaper rzeczpospolita 
the retreat from a declaration of candidacy was vintage walesa 
who typically is circumspect in discussing his political moves and 
often makes seemingly contradictory statements 
one close adviser to walesa speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the solidarity leader is now biding his time regarding the 
presidency 
after the union congress we will launch the battle with a 
firm hand the adviser said 
there was no immediate comment from jaruzelski or his aides 
about a potential walesa presidential bid 
jaruzelski who began a trip wednesday to the soviet union was 
elected president by parliament last july with solidaritys passive 
assistance despite leading the 1981 martial law crackdown that 
suppressed the union jaruzelski resigned as communist party leader 
shortly after assuming the presidency 
but at a time when the old communist leaders have been swept 
away throughout eastern europe many solidarity activists are upset 
jaruzelski remains president 
the discussion of a presidential bid by walesa also brings into 
focus his growing differences with the government of tadeusz 
mazowiecki a union adviser who became the east blocs first 
noncommunist prime minister last august 
walesa has accused the government of acting too slowly to 
privatize the state economy and remove the old communist elite from 
positions of influence in factories and local governments 
reiterating his criticism walesa told reporters wednesday that 
despite solidaritys achievements since its founding there are 
still too few practical improvements in peoples lives 
there has been a victory but no use is being made of this 
victory walesa said

a jury on wednesday found a convict 
guilty of murdering his exwife while free on a prison furlough 
alan l matheney 39 could receive the death penalty for the 
1989 beating death of lisa m bianco the jury was to return to 
court thursday to decide whether matheney should be executed or go 
to prison 
the jury rejected matheneys insanity defense in convicting him 
of murder and burglary after nearly seven hours of deliberations 
matheney listened impassively to the verdict chewing gum as he 
stood at the defense table with his hands folded in front of him 
moments later bailiffs and sheriffs deputies led him from the 
courtroom 
the victims father eugene bianco listened quietly to the 
verdict then wept as a prosecutors assistant came up to hug him 
he declined to comment on the conviction 
before deliberations began the judge told jurors they could 
find matheney guilty innocent not responsible by reason of 
insanity or guilty but mentally ill 
the judge and jury were brought to south bend for the trial from 
lake county to the west in a change of venue 
in closing arguments the prosecution described matheney as a 
methodical killer trying to manipulate the courts by pleading 
insanity 
theres no evidence whatsover on the insanity issue st 
joseph county deputy prosecutor john d krisor said and he was 
able to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct on march 4 
1989 
matheney received an eighthour furlough that day from the 
indiana reformatory near indianapolis and drove to the south bend 
suburb of mishawaka where he broke into ms biancos home chased 
her outside and beat her to death prosecutors say 
matheney had been serving an eightyear term for a 1987 assault 
of ms bianco 
in his closing argument defense attorney scott l king repeated 
a concession to the jury that matheney killed the 29yearold 
woman this defense never never sugarcoated anything to you 
he said 
king attacked the states evidence on the burglary charge a 
key element in the prosecutions attempt to seek the death penalty 
he attacked the credibility of matheneys fellow inmates who 
testified he talked of killing ms bianco if he received a 
furlough suggesting the inmates might have lied in exchange for 
lenient treatment he contended the prosecution failed to prove 
matheney entered ms biancos home intending to kill her 
king asked the jurors to consider all the evidence 
the evidence included psychiatric testimony that matheney has 
been mentally ill since adolescence and contradicting testimony 
also from psychiatrists that he is not mentally ill 
matheney contended that ms bianco conspired with a prosecutor 
to keep him unjustly imprisoned according to testimony

parliaments leadership has 
tentatively approved another version of the countrys name in an 
effort to defuse ethnic tensions a newspaper reported wednesday 
protests broke out in the slovak capital of bratislava following 
the renaming of the country on march 23 to the czechoslovak 
federative republic 
the svobodne slovo daily newspaper said the new name for the 
country approved by parliament leaders would be czech and slovak 
federative republic 
the proposal is to be discussed at parliaments next session 
wednesday in hopes of resolving the most bitter controversy in the 
new legislature 
in january reflecting the end of four decades of hardline 
communist rule new president vaclav havel proposed to drop the 
word socialist from the name czechoslovak socialist 
republic to symbolize the countrys departure from its communist 
past 
slovaks representing one third of the countrys population and 
feeling belittled by the more affluent czechs seized the 
opportunity to demand that their own identity be specified in the 
countrys new name 
parliament in renaming the country march 23 allowed the 
slovaks to spell their version of the countrys name with a hyphen 
czechoslovak 
this compromise solution pushed through parliament by havel 
also fell short of the slovaks expectations 
thousands of separatists have demonstrated in bratislava 
protesting against the new name and demanding an independent slovak 
state 
havel called a meeting friday of the countrys czech and slovak 
leaders in a lastditch effort to find a name acceptable to all 
parties 
the parliamentary presidium is of the opinion that the current 
name of the state can only be used with difficulties and recommends 
its alteration svobodne slovo quoted from a statement issued by 
parliament leaders 
the parliament bogged down in passing dozens of laws needed for 
the transition of its economy from the stalinist model to 
freemarket mechanisms will lose its mandate april 19 elections 
are june 89

owners began letting them keep part of the fees their patients 
paid a study found 
the study implies that whether or not a sick person receives a 
test or a procedure can depend on what the doctor makes rather 
than strictly what the patient needs 
while this conflict of interest may influence care at many 
levels of medicine the latest study focused on storefront walkin 
clinics which often pay their doctors a percentage of their 
patients total bills 
some critics contend this system gives doctors a financial 
incentive to perform more tests and xrays if this is the 
intention the study suggests that it works doctors subjected 
their patients to more tests and other care when they personally 
profited from the extra care

ct wu is back in taiwan leaving behind 
in the united states a promising career with leading companies an 
800000 home in maryland and a lifestyle he adored 
he gave it up to start his own hightechnology company at the 
sciencebased industrial park in this gritty city about 45 miles 
southwest of taipei wu and hundreds of other returning 
professionals are helping extend taiwans economic miracle into the 
21st century 
wu 36 lived the american dream during 11 years in the united 
states receiving a doctorate in communications and winning gtes 
highest technical achievement award for his work in satellites 
in 1988 he decided to return to taiwan because lower labor 
costs and easier access to capital would help him start his own 
communications business 
im an entrepreneur at heart wu explained in the bare 
offices of his 6monthold company national datacomm corp at the 
industrial park 
among other fledgling entrepreneurs in the park is henry h sun 
chairman of 1yearold coast hitech corp it produces microwave 
components for radar and missiles 
sun 57 said he worked for itt corp in space defense before 
setting up coast hitech with two partners who also came from the 
united states 
he and the others view the company in part as a way to pass on 
their knowledge and experience to the people in taiwan sun 
said 
the governmentrun science park established a decade ago 
entices entrepreneurs with tax holidays duty exemptions and other 
incentives 
it has several representatives overseas including one in the 
heart of californias silicon valley to help persuade taiwans 
brightest to return home 
more than half the 1000 people with graduate degrees who work 
in the science park formerly lived abroad klaus c wiemer 
president of taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co said he 
employs about 50 taiwanese recruited from the united states 
if it becomes known that im looking for a particular person 
like a quality control manager than its only a matter of weeks 
before the resumes start rolling in by fax he said 
wiemer an american citizen whose company is a joint venture of 
the government and nv philips of the netherlands said 
professionals were returning to taiwan for several reasons 
technology in the most advanced companies finally is reaching 
levels comparable to that of us firms so challenging jobs can 
now be found for top engineers he said 
initial salaries in taiwan may be relatively low but returning 
professionals can make a lot of money by acquiring stock in their 
new companies before they go public 
he also noted that chinese are family oriented so many of the 
people who left 10 to 20 years ago see their parents getting very 
old and now they want to come back and be close 
the homeward flow of talent is critical to the further 
development of taiwan an exportoriented powerhouse that is 
finding many of its lowskill manufacturing industries no longer 
can compete with neighboring asian countries that offer cheaper 
land and labor 
experts say taiwan soon will become the worlds fourthlargest 
manufacturer of semiconductors among more than 100 companies in 
the science park are 25 semiconductor firms and more than 30 others 
involved in computer technology 
the number of taiwanese returning represents a fraction of the 
bright ones who go abroad an average of 6500 students leave for 
american universities annually and statistics indicate more than 
half stay in the united states the education ministry said 
a diplomat at the us mission in taipei said us officials 
were not worried about highly skilled taiwanese leaving american 
companies 
wiemer said the drain of some top talent back to taiwan 
particularly given the intense global competition in hightech 
industries certainly is going to hurt the united states but 
at least the outflow is to a friendly nation 
many who have returned complain about the islands increasing 
crime deteriorating environment and turbulent society so one of 
the governments most difficult tasks may be to keep them from 
going abroad once again 
its been very hard to adjust to life here wu said is he 
glad to be back not really 
sun wants to retire in the united states where his wife and 
children still live and wu also plans to go back after five or six 
years 
mentalitywise im 100 percent american said wu who 
prominently displays in his office a handdrawn flag his colleagues 
gave him when he became a us citizen i feel home when im back 
in the united states

in a world of mostly white shows mostly 
white producers and mostly white advertisers in living color 
promises to stick out like a raisin in a bowl of rice 
because almost the entire cast is black partly mostly its 
because of the shows black humor 
fox television likes to pride itself on pushing the 
envelope as tom wolfes astronauts in the right stuff put 
it but is the alternative network ready for warp speed 
make that warped speed 
consider the sketches already in the can for this black version 
of saturday night live which debuts sunday after foxs 
toprated married with children theres the homeboy 
shopping network in which two black men unload a semitruck full 
of very hot items including a satellite dish with nasa 
emblazoned on its face 
not only do you get all the stations out there promises one 
of the jivetalking hosts you can talk directly to the 
astronauts 
theres also men on film featuring two gay black movie 
reviewers spoofing siskel and ebert spike lees do the right 
thing gets a limpwristed two snaps up from the fey duo 
sandwiched between the skits a la saturday night live are 
fake commercials calvin kleins obsession becomes oppression 
for black men if only he wasnt so dark 
a takeoff on the united negro college funds motto admonishes 
young blacks to keep your butt in school 
wait a minute is it ok to laugh at this stuff doesnt it 
perpetuate black stereotypes isnt it exploitative 
oh get over it says keenen ivory wayans the 31yearold 
executive producerwritercast member of in living color 
black people arent supposed to be funny woody allens jewish 
and he makes fun of jews says wayans no ones ever accused 
him of being antisemitic 
if wayans brand of black parody sounds familiar its because 
hes the same person who starred in and cowrote hollywood 
shuffle and made his directing debut in im gonna git you 
sucka the latter has grossed more than 19 million since its 
1988 release 
he pals around with guys like lee arsenio hall eddie murphy 
and robert townsend with whom he made hollywood shuffle 
wayans is a hot property right now and he knows it in living 
color was not a show he shopped around to the networks fox came 
to him and gave him carte blanche 
they basically said you can do whatever you want to wayans 
says while sitting in foxs hollywood offices if you have a 
chance to do something that will have some impact you do it 
to do in living color which unlike saturday night live 
is being taped in advance wayans enlisted almost half his 
10member family 
sister kim and brothers damon and shawn will be regulars on the 
show a nationwide search was launched for the rest of the ensemble 
cast of comedians two former writers from david lettermans show 
were hired 
on its end fox signed up for eight halfhour episodes gave it 
a prestigious time slot and is promoting the daylights out of it 
still fox executives are more than a bit nervous about the 
shows content 
but its good nervous says 29yearold damon who stars in 
the homeboy shopping network segment alongside keenen 
there is a concern but we trust our producers says brad 
turell a senior vice president of fox broadcasting co we think 
this show is going to be a big hit its very funny 
and not racist say turell and wayans im just telling 
jokes wayans says theres no big message behind it and no plan 
to change the world 
nothing in the medium of entertainment changes people the 
only thing that changes people is government and laws what i want 
to do is make america and the entertainment industry accept blacks 
in a different format

cant get into miss saigon already seen 
aspects of love on broadway musical devotees in london have 
another option a scifi shakespeare spoof now rocking n rolling 
to an awardwinning beat 
return to the forbidden planet with its collegiate good 
humor and inspired silliness recently won londons equivalent of 
the tony award as the years best musical beating the heavyweight 
favorite miss saigon 
who would have thought the spunky show could accomplish such a 
feat certainly not bob carlton the musicals writerdirector 
i didnt think we had a chance in the world the 39yearold 
carlton said in an interview as a company we were just pleased 
to be nominated that was our cup final or rose bowl 
its taken us all by surprise 
playing at the cambridge theater return to the forbidden 
planet is based on the campy 1956 movie forbidden planet 
starring walter pidgeon leslie nielsen and anne francis the 
movies plot was derived from shakespeares the tempest and 
involves a spaceage prospero who creates monsters from his own id 
the characters in the musical include the chiseljawed 
captain tempest dr prospero the scientist and miranda his 
daughter described in the program as wouldbe homecoming queen 
and virgin while they set off for the planet dillyria the 
theater shakes to such songs as monster mash great balls of 
fire and only the lonely 
not exactly the stuff from which awards are won or so carlton 
thought until april 8 when the 14th annual laurence olivier 
awards honoring achievement in theater dance and opera were 
announced 
producer andre ptaszynski said his show benefited from what 
might be called its unpredictability factor the element of 
surprise always works if you can deliver the goods he said 
you know what youre going to see with miss saigon he 
said of the musical about the vietnam war which opens on broadway 
next april a grand show one step on from les miserables 
but forbidden planet he said catches people off 
balance 
carlton said its appeal also lay in the populism of the show a 
show regarded by many as a party 
ive been saying for quite a long time that its a peoples 
show and i think thats what did it for us in the end he said 
the olivier prizes are conferred by a panel that mixes industry 
professionals and members of the general public 
critical response has been varied the spectator londons 
highbrow weekly magazine didnt bother to review it time out 
the determinedly hip listings magazine called it tacky wacky 
and very loud wear earplugs and be prepared to dance in the 
aisles 
the win vindicates ptaszynskis faith in the musical which he 
first optioned during its 1986 run at the fringe tricycle 
theater in northwest london 
budgeted at about 490000 the west end production lost 16300 
to 24450 a week during its first two months at the 1300seat 
cambridge theater ptaszynski said 
he said it has not had a losing week since the end of november 
and is now playing to 80 percent capacity twice the 40 percent 
needed to break even 
the advance sale is about 490000 a figure ptaszynski said is 
one nought zero less than that for miss saigon that show 
which is as largescale and complex as forbidden planet is 
smallscale and unpretentious cost 57 million to produce 
according to producer cameron mackintosh 
ptaszynski said there was interest in taking forbidden 
planet to australia and japan as well as broadway and los 
angeles but as he looks toward a fall 1991 new york opening he 
warned against overhyping the show in advance 
id rather america discovered the show rather than blazing in 
as the musical that beat miss saigon he said wed like to 
get it through ellis island quietly

christians on good friday mark the crucifixion of jesus a man 
regarded as manifesting god on earth through twists of history 
his death has been blamed variously on fellow jews romans a 
combination of both 
a noted professor of ancient history paul l maier says it is 
beyond debate that the roman governor pilate delivered the 
execution verdict and bears the final legal responsibility 
theologically however christians themselves in recalling that 
event acknowledge that their own sinful failings brought about the 
crucifixion necessitating it to redeem humanity 
they were involved they were there a hymn for the days 
services goes only through that confessed participation in the 
wrong do they find forgiveness for it through jesus suffering on 
the cross 
its regarded as the atonement the laying down of a sinless 
life to make amends for universal offenses against that goodness 
in that purpose god so loved the world that he gave his only 
son scripture says 
the day is called good friday because the crucifixion is 
seen as absorbing the results of human wrongs in god himself thus 
providing his pardon from them his grace 
it is the great saving act in the belief of christians the 
essential key to their ultimate salvation for them it is a 
topmost good 
despite that basic theology however various slants 
contentions and distortions about jesus death have sometimes made 
it a bitter legacy 
probably no issue in the history of religion has elicited more 
blind partisanship misinterpretation faulty logic hostility or 
fad following maier writes 
the pendulum has swung from one illogical indeed ridiculous 
concept to another from assuming jewish generic involvement to 
arguing for no involvement at all he writes in the april 9 issue 
of the evangelical fortnightly christianity today 
maier who teaches ancient history at western michigan 
university and who has written several books about first century 
judaism of which jesus was a part says the early church often bent 
scripture to blame jesus fellow jews 
that notion of jewish collective responsibility for the 
crucifixion had horrifying results through the centuries 
ghettoization pogroms the inquisition centuries of 
antisemitism the nazi holocaust maier says 
past labeling of jews as christ killers was illogical 
unethical and misinterprets the gospels maier says that 
falsehood has been repudiated by almost all churches including the 
world council of churches and roman catholicisms second vatican 
council 
however he says that in trying to atone for the past its 
become high theological fashion to argue that no jews were 
involved on good friday in the manner set forth in the gospels 
these arguments blame only pilate but to deny any jewish 
participation flies in the face of historical fact including 
traditions in the ancient nonbiblical jewish sources maier writes 
he says opposition to jesus of the jewish religious rulers led 
by the high priest is confirmed by the ancient jewish historian 
josephus account of their later plotting the death of jesus 
kinsman james 
certainly jesus had his jewish opponents maier says and 
doubtlessly there was a group shouting crucify but that 
claque seems to have been primarly a throng from the temple a 
group perfectly orchestrated by jesus priestly adversaries 
but jesus also had his jewish friends and supporters on good 
friday and not just the timid 12 disciples maier says citing 
the massive adulation he received on palm sunday and other 
occasions 
thousands of jewish passover pilgrims must also have remained 
loyal to him maier says but most of the projesus jews failed 
to learn of his arrest hearings and trial until it was too late 
he was arrested after many had retired for the night on 
thursday and he stood trial at dawn the next morning maier says 
that early morning camouflage was arranged by pilate apparently to 
avoid an uprising 
however maier contends that past misinterpretations should not 
justify tampering with the scriptural sources secular 
historical records of the first century support the new testament 
records he says 
however he says christians should always identify generalizing 
of the jews in johns gospel as meaning jesus jewish 
opponents never jews in general 
but that doesnt mean johns gospel is antisemitic maier says 
noting that the josephus also often refers to his opponents simply 
as the jews without intending to generalize

in the struggle over lithuanian secession 
gettough pressure from congress sends moscow a signal that 
president bush has purposefully muted 
that relayed message is blunt if president mikhail s gorbachev 
clamps down more harshly on lithuania bush will have no political 
alternative but to retaliate diplomatically and their may 30 
summit meeting in washington is hostage to soviet forbearance 
both presidents have to guard their political flanks against 
hardliners gorbachev faces soviet conservatives who want him to 
crack down hard on lithuania bush has heard demands from the ranks 
in both political parties for economic and diplomatic measures to 
support the breakaway baltic state and punish moscow for what it 
already has done to bar secession 
the hardline pressures on gorbachev were underscored monday 
when about 300 conservative members of the supreme soviet told him 
he should retroactively annul the parliamentary elections that led 
to lithuanias march 11 declaration of independence and dissolve 
the lithuanian parliament 
another warning came from the 16member presidential council 
headed by gorbachev which was said to have decided that 
additional economic political and other measures should be 
taken to unless the independence declaration is rescinded in favor 
of the slow tortuous process the soviet constitution sets for 
secession the threatened steps were not specified 
gorbachev eased up a bit on tuesday saying he still hopes to 
work out a solution and would decree presidential rule only as an 
extreme measure in case of civil conflict 
i would just appeal to all sides and anyone with any influence 
to encourage dialogue and discussion bush said tuesday night in 
toronto repeating his warning against the use of force 
the white house has a rule of silence on steps and countersteps 
in the lithuanian crisis all in keeping with the presidents 
effort to calm the controversy here as well as there 
hardline demands that gorbachev put down the secessionists 
sometimes seem to serve a tactical purpose for the soviet 
president echoing in washington as warnings that if he bends too 
far on lithuania he could be undercut or even pushed from power 
conservative republicans have suggested that if gorbachev is 
that fragile the administration may be wagering too much on him 
the bush course seems more attuned to the advice of sen edward m 
kennedy dmass who saw gorbachev in moscow late last month and 
returned to counsel caution in washington 
bush and kennedy discussed the visit the president sent 
gorbachev a letter said to have reiterated his support for the 
right to selfdetermination in lithuania and his urging that the 
secession controversy be settled without force through peaceful 
negotiations 
i want to be sure that the soviets understand our position and 
understand that were not trying to make things difficult for 
lithuania or the soviet union or anybody else bush said 
congressional leaders in both parties have endorsed the 
cautious measured bush approach but it is clear that a crackdown 
involving soviet force would undo that and a lot more all bets 
would be off said seate republican leader bob dole 
the first casualty in an escalated crackdown would be a new 
trade agreement with preferences moscow seeks the administration 
is trying to get one ready for the bushgorbachev summit scheduled 
in seven weeks the meeting itself would be at risk should the 
soviets clamp down hard 
but there already are suggestions in congress that what moscow 
already has done against lithuanian secession should derail a trade 
deal until the unequal struggle is settled peacefully and on terms 
giving lithuanians their independence 
thirtyone senators signed a letter to bush last week saying 
the united states should take a stronger stand for lithuanian 
independence now is the time to inform the soviet leadership 
what specific actions our government may take in response to the 
further use of armed force in lithuania they argued 
while the heaviest pressure comes from the republican right 
there are democrats on the case too arguing for sterner steps to 
free lithuania from the soviet rule decreed by hitler and stalin 50 
years ago 
sen jesse helms rnc tried to have the senate urge bush to 
extend immediate diplomatic recognition to the government of 
lithuania that was rejected 5936 a day later on march 22 the 
senate voted 950 for a toneddown version warning against soviet 
force and asking bush to consider recognition 
the house passed a similar resolution april 4 saying that the 
president should normalize diplomatic relations as soon as possible 
sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said that in isolating and trying to 
intimidate lithuania the soviets already have taken steps that 
very much resemble martial law he warned that the improving 
trend in eastwest relations could be at risk 
sen alfonse damato rny made his showandtell trip to a 
polish border crossing into lithuania to be predictably turned 
back for lack of a soviet visa 
that harsher line in congress makes the point bush is not 
making at least not publicly his cautious conciliatory handling 
of gorbachevs dilemma could not withstand a crackdown in lithuania

some people like them plain some people 
like them peanut and some people never eat the brown ones 
fifty years after forrest mars first coated a drop of chocolate 
with a colorful sugar shell just how do his successors like their 
mampms 
john and forrest mars jr who inherited the privately held 
mampmmars from their father in 1973 arent saying they never give 
interviews but its a safe bet they like them all just fine what 
with 100 million of the ubiquitous sweets rolling out of their 
hackettstown plant every day and the profits nobodys saying how 
much rolling in 
half a century after the elder forrest decided chocolate lovers 
should be able to indulge their sweetteeth without creating a 
gooey mess mampms still are holding up in hot little hands across 
the world and out in space 
our consumers are telling us theyre being enjoyed mampmmars 
spokeswoman mary ellen dougherty said they eat them and their 
children eat them and their childrens children eat them 
mampms were packed in world war ii gi rations served at the 1984 
olympics in los angeles and launched with 31 shuttle flights the 
rock band van halens contract calls for a backstage stash of three 
pounds of mampms with all the brown and tan ones removed 
theres more to the modern mampm than shades of sienna however 
they come in red and white with hearts for valentines day green 
and red stamped with bells candles or trees for christmas and in 
pastel colors for easter 
the candy empire that produces all these varieties began in 1911 
with frank c mars small business in tacoma wash in 1940 his 
son forrest devised a candy modeled after a british confection a 
circle of chocolate covered with a crunchy coating 
mampms were born as much out of meteorological necessity as 
anything 
in those days the stores didnt have air conditioning the 
cars didnt have air conditioning the homes didnt have air 
conditioning mampmmars spokesman hans fiuczynski said 
the candy originally sold in paper tubes came in brown 
yellow orange red green and violet later replaced by tan 
although never patented each mampm beginning in 1950 was stamped 
with the trademark m to assure customers they were getting the 
real thing 
peanut mampms at first available only in brown were introduced 
in 1954 and colored peanut candies came along six years later 
it was during those years that mampm ltd settled in hackettstown 
a burgeoning rural community amid the hills and farms of 
northwestern new jersey 
since then mampms have survived not only the heat of summer but 
controversy and candycoated corporate challenges 
in 1982 university student paul hethmon founded the nowdefunct 
society for the restoration and preservation of red mampms whose 
500 members flooded the company with letters demanding the return 
of the reds 
the company had discontinued them in 1976 because of the cancer 
scare over red dye no 2 although the candy never contained the 
substance 
red mampms reappeared in 1987 the same year the company dodged a 
challenge by lotte ltd of tokyo the japanese company was 
marketing mampm lookalikes in their country which also is mampm 
territory 
us sen frank lautenberg dnj asked the japanese 
ambassador to the united states to investigate lotte agreed in 
july 1987 to halt production of the copycats which were advertised 
as mellow in your mouth wont stick to your hand

when the telephone company comes calling will 
american creditcard users change their charging ways 
thats the question of the moment in the world of personal 
finance thanks to american telephone amp telegraph cos 
introduction of a combination telephone and credit card known as 
the atampt universal card 
the giantsized venture seems to be off to a promising start 
while the company wont give specifics it has described consumers 
early response to the card as far above initial expectations 
by some outsiders estimates atampt could sign up as many as 5 
million universal cardholders by the end of the year 
but close observers of the financialservices business say the 
ventures ultimate success is by no means assured 
they say it is a lot to expect that large numbers of people who 
get universal cards will cut up and throw away the ones they 
already carry from banks and issuers like american express and 
sears roebuck amp co 
whatever happens analysts add consumers evidently will 
continue to be faced with an old problem paying much higher 
interest rates for creditcard borrowing than they do for just 
about any other type of loan 
this will not shake up the credit card industry says robert 
heady a north palm beach fla publisher of several newsletters 
on banking subjects 
what lured atampt into such a highstakes gamble is plain to see 
the business fed by americans seemingly insatiable passion for 
plastic is big and getting bigger all the time 
in spite of deterrents like taxlaw changes that are eliminating 
deductions for consumer interest more than 20 percent of all 
retail sales in this country excluding automobiles now are paid for 
by credit card up from 116 percent in 1983 
atampt is offering several lures to try to establish a strong 
beachhead in this market for one thing it says customers can 
avoid ever having to pay an annual fee if they apply in 1990 and 
keep using their cards at least once a year 
for another the company is offering 10 percent discounts from 
its prevailing chargecard rates when the card is used for 
longdistance calls 
cardusers who carry a balance from one month to the next will 
pay a variable annual interest rate that is starting off at 189 
percent atampt says 
the rate doesnt differ drastically from industry norms in the 
18 percent20 percent range at a time when rates on mortgages 
home equity loans and auto loans generally run in the 95 
percent125 percent range 
so however much atampt is going to step up the competition it 
evidently has no plans for a price war 
at the same time analysts say the chance to avoid annual fees 
may be attractive to consumers who pay full balances each month 
before interest charges kick in 
but as heady points out atampt is hardly the first issuer to 
offer a nofee card some banks across the country have similar 
deals he observes with lower interest rates to boot 
in sum most analysts believe the addition of a major new 
player doesnt seem likely to change the game very much 
credit cards are essentially perceived as a convenience 
heady says consumers have been paying atrociously high 
creditcard interest rates for years

at a time when some economic analysts are 
erasing the word recession from their forecasts sindlinger amp 
co is declaring that one is under way 
it is widespread says albert sindlinger by his measurements 
it involves 41 of the 48 contiguous states all but washington and 
the midwestern states of ohio michigan wisconsin indiana 
illinois and minnesota 
it is an unusual recession a credit crunch recession says 
sindlinger his staff gets into detailed telephone conversations 
with close to 1000 americans each week different ones each week 
as it has for 30 years 
the midwest was hit hardest by the last recession so families 
there were less likely to get overextended financially after it 
ended 
the list of respondents is scientifically selected and the 
questions are devised to elicit specific hard details about each 
household that are computerized at the companys headquarters in 
wallingford pa 
from analyses of the information garnered sindlinger is able to 
get a reading on the finances of the nations 992 million 
households the biggest sector in the entire economy households 
call the shots he says 
as of a few days ago the financial condition of households 
wasnt good they were loaded with debt they were having a tough 
time paying their bills and they were very concerned 
the us government whose statistical findings are used in 
determining official recessions disagrees with sindlinger to the 
government at least two straight quarters of declining gross 
national product constitute recession 
that definition has come under plenty of criticism especially 
since the facts often arent known until weeks after the event 
some critics even declare the idea outdated but the definition 
remains the most widely used 
officially there have not been two successive quarterly 
declines in gross national product since the early 1980s that is 
based on government figures 
based on sindlingers definition there have been he arrives at 
his conclusions based on answers to these questions 
1 is your current income higher lower or the same as it was 
six months ago 
2 is your expected income six months hence higher lower or the 
same 
3 a similar question about job security 
4 a similar one about local business 
summed up the answers represent household liquidity and when 
negative answers outweigh positive responses sindlinger declares an 
area in recession 
among other findings in the latest survey his researchers 
detected that expenses were rising faster than incomes in that 
situation and with debts to repay consumers cant buy goods 
earlier government figures showed the economy flirting with 
recession but that threat was revised away 
in january for example the government reported gross national 
product rose by only 05 percent in the fourth quarter of 1989 
that weakness led to expectations of further weakness in the first 
quarter of 1990 
you might recall that at that time in january there arose a 
flurry of recession talk as many economists warned of eventual 
negative growth but in january the government revised that weak 
05 percent to 09 percent 
that revision caused some economic forecasters to change their 
outlook instead of recession they spoke again of a soft landing 
in march when the government rerevised that fourthquarter 
estimate to an even more positive 11 percent it all but wiped out 
the recession forecasts 
meanwhile says sindlinger financial matters were growing worse 
in the households of the united states 
obviously sindlinger says when the consumer is caught in a 
vise it lessens both his desire and ability to buy at retail if 
retailers cant sell sindlinger asks what can manufacturers 
expect

the earth is in style 
alarmed by the planets dwindling resources or propelled by the 
belief that ecology helps sell clothes fashion designers and 
retailers have latched onto environmental issues with a gusto that 
recalls the stampede to short skirts 
tags on sportswear declare dont bungle the jungle whales 
black panthers tigers and giant pandas adorn tshirts popular 
fabric colors include earth tones and the bright hues of the rain 
forest catalogs are printed on recycled paper glossy ads for 
fashion designers invite consumers to donate money to environmental 
groups 
so many companies are getting on the environmental bandwagon 
because many polls indicate that the environment is the predominant 
social issue of the 90s said leslie gottlieb of the council on 
economic priorities 
womens wear daily has been swamped with news releases 
announcing the introduction of new lines of clothing with an 
ecoconscience said maryellen gordon a wwd sportswear news editor 
the industry does have a history of being involved in 
humanitarian causes she said but i dont believe every one of 
these companies is concerned with the environment by printing 
save the whale on a tshirt they think they can bring in a lot 
of money 
im sure part of it is corporations wanting to position 
themselves in a positive way with the public said ron geatz a 
spokesman for the nature conservancy a private foundation that 
buys parcels of threatened land to protect the habitats of rare and 
endangered plants and animals 
geatz added that the corporate heads leading the way seem to be 
those most personally involved 
charles dayan president of bonjour clothing became a corporate 
activist for the environment several summers ago when syringes and 
other debris washed up on the beach at his new jersey vacation home 
we couldnt go to the water we couldnt let the kids play 
there he said thats when we realized it was getting too 
close to us and something had to be done 
now each item of bonjour merchandise jeans and shirts 
sunglasses and socks bears a tag with tips on how to save water 
and reduce pollutants the cost to bonjour dayan said is in the 
millions 
i really dont know if it will sell one extra jean or watch 
dayan said i doubt it 
other companies like ninety esprit ellen tracy and the united 
stars of america division of jg hook are donating profits to 
environmental causes 
patagonia an outdoor outfitter based in ventura calif has 
donated 10 percent of its annual pretax profits to environmental 
groups since 1984 this year the total will reach about 1 million 
patagonias catalogs feature essays on the environment the 
company has reduced waste output at its headquarters by 62 percent 
by cutting back on paper products and recycling whatever it can 
some customers choose patagonia products because of where the 
profits go said kevin sweeney a company spokesman last year 
we gave away twice as much as we spent in advertising 
but the line often blurs between promoting environmental causes 
and promoting a product the nature conservancy struck deals with 
two fashion companies ellen tracy and esprit after being 
approached with a couple dozen offers geatz said 
ellen tracys ads show a model in a sunny orange jacket over 
olive pants standing on a pristine beach the tagline reads the 
clothing perfect for spring the background perfect 
forever 
the conservancys phone number is displayed in small print 
weve always shot our spring ads on the beach we added 
the tagline to tie into the nature conservancy thing kind of cute 
to bring it all together said claire fay a spokeswoman for 
ellen tracy 
she said the companys owner herbert gallen made a 
substantial donation to the nature conservancy and paid a 15 
membership fee for each of ellen tracys 200 employees 
esprit contributes 1 each time it sells a 25 tote bag 
imprinted with images of bighorn sheep and little kern golden 
trout the companys spring catalog printed on recycled paper 
opens with a discourse on the environment the background is a 
photograph of a swimsuitclad model playing in a spray of water 
pollution is by and large the result of an economic system 
gone out of control the ad says consumers should evaluate 
carefully what they need and buy accordingly 
the ad implores people to temper their appetites esprit it 
notes has already begun to do so at its san francisco 
headquarters it has reduced the use of paper in the business 
department and the cafeteria the company plans to hire an 
ecomanager to head environmental programs 
before telling our customers what to do we need to do our own 
homework said esprit spokeswoman celeste alleyne 
but critics scoff at the notion of the fashion industry being a 
friend of the environment 
the irony is that were talking about a business based on 
premeditated waste said stuart ewen the chairman of the 
communications department at hunter college in new york city if 
you were to do a study of the history of product obsolescence the 
model would be fashion 
at factory level other ecological concerns surface 
the next step we have to take is to move to our suppliers to 
make sure the clothes are made in an environmentally safe way 
said sweeney the patagonia spokesman 
esprit and ellen tracy are studying how to make production of 
their clothes ecofriendly bonjour president dayan said he wrote 
to manufacturers all over the world instructing them to use 
biodegradable plastic bags and soaps as well as recycled cardboard 
however he acknowledged we cant force them to do it

this time the dream was reality for the worlds 
jews to a large extent an aspiration and hope of the passover 
season had been fulfilled in a contemporary context 
a modern pharaoh had let a confined jewish people go 
at last most are allowed to go free says a special 
haggadah or narrative of the ancient deliverance of the enslaved 
jews from egypt memorializing that exodus this year had a ring of 
present happening 
we have good cause to be joyous for hundreds of thousands of 
people the world over jews and others have gained freedom within 
the past year said sholom d comay president of the american 
jewish committee 
referring to the epochmaking changes toward freedom that 
have surged through the soviet union and other nations of eastern 
europe he said the task of building working democracies still 
remains 
it behooves us to work unceasingly to move forward the growth 
of human rights and democratic principles in all of newly open 
eastern europe he said in a passover message 
the weeklong observance continues through this weekend 
coinciding with the christian celebration of easter both emphasize 
freedom from bondage easter from sin and death passover from 
oppression and tyranny 
the perennial passover theme the unending responsibility of 
every generation to resist religious repression took on a note of 
jubilation this time at the lifting of restraints on soviet jews 
more than 71000 of them immigrated last year to israel the 
us and elsewhere far more than in any previous year and l00000 
were expected to do so this year 
at the same time fuller liberties of religious practice and 
study developed in the soviet sphere 
its not only a miracle its a double miracle simcha 
dinitz chairman of the world zionist organization told a new york 
conference noting that soviet jews not only were being allowed to 
leave but to practice their faith in the soviet 
the special passover narrative the exodus haggadah from 
tyranny to freedom a celebration was prepared by the united 
jewish appeal rabbinic cabinet in cooperation with the national 
conference on soviet jewry 
ours is the special merit to see again gods redemptive power 
evident said rabbi matthew simon chairman of the appeals 
rabbinic cabinet 
the haggadah says suppression of faith weighed on soviet 
jews for 70 years many suffered harassment some endured prison 
the forces of oppression tried to afflict them with amnesia of the 
spirit but they remembered 
now at last doors have swung wide a passage continues we 
know not how long the door of freedom will remain open we walk 
with them in their exoduswe commit ourselves to accompany them 
on their road to freedom 
we sing with grateful joy and pride bring our people home 
rabbi david a wortman executive director of the jewish 
community relations council of philadelphia and editor of the 
haggadah said it marks the miraculous extension of the ancient 
process initiated by god and moses 
he noted that 600000 jews were involved in the ancient exodus 
from egypt and said estimates are that those leaving the soviet 
union by 1993 will have surpassed in number those who left 
egypt 
soviet jews total about 2 million 
some of those released earlier from the prereform soviet to 
israel are quoted it is like being reborn said vladimir

south americans facing high 
foreign debts ruinous inflation and stagnant economies are 
rejecting radicalism for moderate leaders they hope can solve the 
problems and consolidate democratic rule 
when fernando collor de mello and patricio aylwin became the 
presidents of brazil and chile in march it was the first time all 
12 south american republics were governed by popularly elected 
civilians 
in the past south americans have swung from strident 
proleftists to rightwing military dictators now they are 
abandoning the radical rhetoric and promises of radicals and 
turning to leaders who favor painful steps toward economic order 
history reveals that stable and effective democracies are 
those that present centrist options to the electorate wrote 
manuel dornellas editor and columnist of expreso a conservative 
daily in lima peru 
there is concern that if freemarket economics and democratic 
freedoms do not produce rapid improvements the result may be a 
political tug of war between left and right 
south americans have tried the dictators and the oldstyle 
conservatives said david fleischer a brazilian political 
scientist if this third group of freemarket liberals goes down 
the drain people will vote for the radical left in five years 
which may well prompt a backlash from the military 
fear of such an outcome already has translated into amnesty for 
past violations 
uruguay and argentina have pardoned military officers charged 
with human rights abuses brazil gave amnesty to leftist opponents 
of a 19641985 military regime but did not consider prosecuting 
military chiefs accused of torture 
leftist rebels have been released from jail and secret police 
agencies abolished 
polls in argentina indicate president carlos menem remains by 
far the most popular political figure despite severe austerity 
measures strikes and dissent within his own party 
luis lacalle the new president of uruguay implemented 
austerity demanded by the international monetary fund worked out 
an agreement with the secondlargest party and survived two general 
strikes by the biggest labor federation 
in brazil surveys indicate collors harsh economic plan is 
supported by 80 percent of the people studies done in peru say the 
people are ready for a freemarket economic shock to end rampant 
inflation 
freemarket policies are gaining ground across the continent 
government coddling of domestic businesses promoted by military 
rulers concerned with national security is giving way as argentina 
and brazil strive to create a south american common market 
economic liberalism also has been fostered by concern that the 
foreign aid funds of the united states and other countries are 
being diverted increasingly to eastern europe 
latin american and carribbean countries will receive 350 
million in us aid this year down from 545 million in 1989 
record inflation has given south american leaders the political 
leverage to take bold economic measures here is a brief 
countrybycountry review 
brazil although collor narrowly defeated socialist luis 
inacio da silva in decembers runoff he has mustered public and 
congressional support for a severe plan that includes an 18month 
freeze on 80 percent of bank and investment savings sharp tax and 
utility increases and cuts in subsidies and tax incentives 
argentina menem shocked his laborbacked peronist party by 
raising utility and other rates by several hundred percent 
removing wage price and foreign exchange controls forcibly 
converting bank deposits into government bonds slashing the 
budget and moving to sell moneylosing state companies 
bolivia former president victor paz estenssoro brought 24000 
percent annual inflation down to 16 percent in 1989 by freeing 
prices and the exchange rate closing moneylosing government tin 
mines and reducing a bloated bureacracy jaime paz zamora a 
socialist who succeeded him has announced plans to attract foreign 
capital and sell state industries 
chile aylwin says he will not discard the freemarket 
structure set up by his predecessor gen augusto pinochet who 
kept inflation down to 20 percent a year and built a strong economy 
peru five years of economic chaos under leftist president 
alan garcia bankrupted the country and pushed inflation to 2775 
percent in 1989 novelist mario vargas llosa head of a 
conservative coalition and centrist alberto fujimori are in a 
runoff election to succeed garcia 
venezuela president carlos andres perez outwardly leftist 
when in office a decade ago recently announced imflike economic 
reforms designed to restructure the foreign debt and steer the 
country on a freemarket path 
guyana and suriname mounting foreign debt sharp declines in 
economic output and rising unemployment are forcing socialist 
leaders to alter their policies prime minister hamilton green of 
guyana has said private enterprise doesnt conflict with 
socialism his party seeks foreign capital and imposed unpopular 
fiscal measures demanded by the imf 
ecuador president rodrigo borja a centerleftist favors 
government fixing of exchange and interest rates but has welcomed 
foreign investment kept the state out of major industries and 
declared himself an opponent of inefficient staterun 
enterprises 
how long south americas poor will accept austerity remains a 
question 
riots last year cost 300 lives in venezuela where subsidies 
have been a part of life for 30 years recent protests of increased 
utility and gasoline prices on college campuses led to a violent 
crackdown 
observers in brazil say collor will have about six months to 
stop inflation now running at 4850 percent annually similar 
rumblings are being felt in colombia and guyana 
if solutions dont come from within the system people might 
look for solutions outside the system said federico storani a 
leading argentine congressman who represents the opposition radical 
civic union 
many experts feel moderate leaders will weather the storm 
because of a growing public perception that freemarket policies 
are the only cure for chronic stagnation and inflation 
menem told reporters recently the changes in eastern europe 
are telling us something ideologies in the world have ended the 
world wants to live in freedom wants to be master of its own 
destiny

as dinosaurs go they were the biggest of the 
big they lived in a region that is now the rocky mountains no 
dwarfs themselves when it comes to hills and its in those 
mountains that their bones are interred offering todays 
scientists valuable clues to the history of life 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for more than a century scientists have been 
digging into a vast dinosaur graveyard in the rocky mountains 
unraveling the mysteries of the largest creatures ever to roam the 
planet 
here lie the fossilized bones of dinosaurs that lived 140 
million years ago when the front range was a great semiarid 
lowland with periods of rain and drought colorado was a flat 
landscape with large meandering streams vegetation and open spaces 
man was still 138 million years away 
called the morrison formation for a small town southwest of 
denver where the first dinosaur skeleton was found here in 1877 
the graveyard lies on either side of the rocky mountains from idaho 
south to new mexico 
paleontologists call it the capital of dinosaur research 
in january a colorado expedition found a jaw and vertebrae 
fragments west of fort collins that belonged to the rare 
meatgulping hunter epanterias 
robert bakker a university of colorado paleontologist who led 
that team says people werent interested in dinosaurs before the 
1877 discovery because they didnt know much about them he said 
that before the colorado find there were miserable fragments of 
fossils from europe 
the morrison finds really put american science on the map and 
continues to surprise us every field season says bakker who has 
been working on the formation since 1974 
a group of preservationminded people in colorado has organized 
friends of dinosaur ridge and is working with local and state 
officials on a project to protect a famous morrison formation 
outcropping southwest of denver 
the group has proposed a park a mile long and 200 feet wide it 
would lie on the first ridge a hogback west of lakewood 
colo a denver suburb if the proposal is approved colorado 26 
would be closed from rooney road to colorado 93 
joe tempel environmental manager for the state highway 
department described the proposed dinosaur ridge park as an 
outdoor education laboratory a handson science ecology 
natural history park 
the most extensive collection of morrison dinosaur fossils are 
housed in the carnegie museum of natural history in pittsburgh 
the morrison gives us the best picture of the really big 
dinosaurs that lived in the age of dinosaurs says david burman 
curator of vertebrae fossils at the carnegie because of the 
nature of the environment it represented it has preserved more and 
better specimens of any formation in any period 
scientists credit the rocky mountains with allowing them to 
study the dinosaur fossils as the earths crust rose and 
contorted erosion exposed layers of sandstone limestone and 
shale the layers display the fossilized bones footprints and 
environment of the jurassic period 
the jurassic a time from 205 million years to 130 million years 
ago is considered the second geological period in the age of 
dinosaurs the morrison formation appeared in the upper jurassic 
period 140 million years ago when the dinosaurs were the largest 
they ever got 
the morrison formation is part of one of the most complete 
records of the history of life you can find says dr richard 
stucky paleontologist at the denver museum of natural history 
there are episodes missing in the rocky mountains but we do have 
a fairly complete record 
in 1877 the dinosaur graveyard was discovered by visiting 
scientists who found an apatosaurus and a stegosaurus near 
morrison that find was quickly followed by the discovery of an 
allosaurus and a camarasaurus north of canon city and dozens of 
dinosaurs north of laramie wyo those discoveries kicked off a 
kind of fossil gold rush that continues today 
there are dozens of theories about the mysterious mass 
extinction of dinosaurs at the end of the mesozoic era among them 
are movements of the earth starvation parasites poisons changes 
in the climate meteorites and even extraterrestrial hunters 
bakker believes dinosaurs became extinct because of worldwide 
diseases that turned into an epidemiological nightmare 
dinosaurs didnt go out with a bang they went out with 
worldwide diarrhea he says 
big animals travel and are very vulnerable to disease bakker 
says as land bridges formed throughout the globe the animals 
would move spreading all the hundreds of diseases throughout all 
the herds on all continents eventually killing the lot 
most of the carnegie collection of fossils came from what is now 
dinosaur national monument on the northwestern coloradoutah 
border in moffat county colo scientists took 750000 pounds of 
crated dinosaurs from the quarries 
the expedition brought the best apatosaurus a topnotch 
diplodocus a teenage camarasaurus and the most complete 
sauropod burman says 
the first dinosaur at the museum was the diplodocus found at 
sheep creek wyo which burman says is one of the most famous in 
the world plaster casts have been made and shipped to germany 
france argentina spain and portugal 
one of the first plaster casts was shipped to the british 
museum at a time when these big fossils were relatively new so 
they created quite a stir in europe burman says newspapers 
carried headlines that read dippy comes to england 
the original diplodocus is still in the carnegie museum but 
pittsburgh is not the only place to see such giants 
in terms of seeing big dinosaurs before your eyes you wont 
see anything like the morrison formation in the world burman 
says it gives people a look at how the dinosaurs occur in the 
rock

lawmakers and lobbyists have a new fistful of 
statistics from the agriculture department as they continue 
jousting over the 1990 farm bill 
an annual report by the departments economic research service 
shows how much it cost to produce major field crops in 1988 a year 
when drought reduced yields and sent market prices soaring net 
returns are also listed 
the report costs of production major field crops 1988 is 
part of an annual series by the usda called economic indicators of 
the farm sector 
analysts make clear how the statistics are compiled and 
presented but there are always ways to use figures in support of 
various arguments and the 1988 cost figures are no exception 
to illustrate assume that it cost a farmer 100 to plant one 
acre of gadgetbeans including field preparation seed chemicals 
and all the rest the expense of producing one acre of gadgetbeans 
would be 100 
that would be true regardless of the gadgetbean yield the cost 
per acre is the key and has nothing directly to do with how many 
bushels are produced 
but turn that around and assume again that it cost 100 per 
planted acre to grow gadgetbeans and that the yield normally would 
be 100 bushels per acre on the average the usual cost of 
production would be 1 per bushel 
however if one year the yield dropped to 50 bushels per acre 
the cost of production would be 2 per bushel if it dropped to 10 
bushels the cost would be 10 per bushel and so on 
this involves the unit cost of production the cost per 
bushel or pound or whatever measure is used it is not the same as 
costs based on each planted acre 
and the distinction is important 
it might serve a group to let congress know about the high 
perbushel costs of producing gadgetbeans while ignoring the 
peracre costs and returns in hopes lawmakers might be 
persuaded to boost subsidies 
the usda report includes both methods of figuring 
costs of producing most major field crops increased in 1988 
the report said variable cash expenses per planted acre were 
higher for all crops except cotton flaxseed and sunflowers 
variable cash expanses include seed fertilizer fuel chemicals 
and hired labor socalled fixed cash expenses include taxes 
insurance interest on operating and real estate loans and 
portions of the general farm overhead 
the report said that in 1988 variable cash expenses rose about 5 
percent per acre for corn barley oats wheat and soybeans rice 
expenses climbed 4 percent grain sorghum 2 percent and peanuts 1 
percent 
despite increased costs and lower yields due primarily to 
drought production returns for most crops improved in 1988 the 
report said higher prices offset lower yields for soybeans 
sunflowers and all major grains except barley 
corn yields per acre dropped by 30 percent in 1988 but harvest 
prices rose to 260 per bushel from 157 in 1987 the report 
said other grain prices also increased 
net cash returns to corn production were 54 per planted 
acre compared with 28 in 1987 the report said direct federal 
payments to farmers were not included 
the net cash returns to oats producers were reported at 43 per 
planted acre nationally compared with 18 in 1987 soybean cash 
returns climbed to 100 per acre from 77 the year before and cash 
returns to wheat farmers jumped to 28 per acre from 18 net cash 
returns for sorghum rose to 89 from 14 in 1987 
returns to barley flaxseed and cotton production fell 
slightly the report said barley yield dropped by more than 40 
percent flaxseed yield by more than 60 percent the gross value of 
production per acre of cotton declined 28 percent as both the price 
of cotton and its yield fell 
shifting gears the analysis said that the lower yields led to 
dramatically higher costs per unit of output in droughtridden 
1988 
when all economic costs are considered cash expenses capital 
replacement and land it cost 316 per bushel to produce corn in 
1988 on a national average compared with 206 in 1987 and 205 
in 1986 
total economic costs of producing wheat jumped to 459 per 
bushel in 1988 from 361 in 1987 and 390 in 1986 
other crops and their total economic costs of production as 
shown for 1988 compared with 1987 and 1986 included 
barley 492 per bushel 279 and 289 
cotton 763 cents per pound 671 cents and 838 cents 
flaxseed 1424 per bushel 575 and 569 
oats 359 per bushel 239 and 212 
peanuts 264 cents per pound 268 cents and 254 cents 
rice 870 per 100 pounds 794 and 740 
grain sorghum 250 per bushel 199 and 2 
soybeans 694 per bushel 503 and 489 
sunflowers 1393 per 100 pounds of seed 802 and 863

the unsecured creditors of eastern airlines have 
asked a bankruptcy court to appoint a special trustee to take over 
the ailing carrier and seek a buyer for it 
tuesdays request by the committee of unsecured credits came one 
day after preferred shareholders challenged easterns 
reorganization proposal and submitted a plan that would put the 
airline in the hands of the shareholders unsecured creditors and 
new managers 
the two groups are easterns biggest creditors owed a total of 
more than 16 billion after long supporting management the 
creditors have become exasperated by easterns growing losses and 
its recent plans to cut debt payments 
meanwhile tuesday easterns pilots union won a key victory when 
a federal judge reversed earlier decisions by us bankruptcy judge 
burton r lifland 
us district judge robert w sweet ruled that the union can 
seek arbitration over its contention that eastern has been merged 
with its sister carrier continental airlines 
sweet also decided that the pilots union may proceed with a 
lawsuit against eastern over its practice of leasing aircraft and 
crews from continental 
lifland had previously ruled in both cases that the bankruptcy 
court was the only proper forum for deciding those issues 
in his 71page opinion sweet wrote that the important question 
was when and in what forum collectively bargainedfor rights may 
be enforced against an employer who has sought protection from 
creditors in bankruptcy 
if a court concludes that eastern and continental have 
effectively been merged it would trigger certain protective labor 
provisions such as seniority rights contained in the pilots 
unions contract with eastern 
easterns pilots machinists and flight attendants struck the 
miamibased airline on march 4 1989 forcing it into chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection five days later 
the machinists union remains on strike against eastern 
lifland had denied the pilots request to lift an automatic stay 
protecting eastern against arbitration on the unions contention 
that the transfer of eastern assets to texas air and continental 
constituted a merger between eastern and its sister carrier 
lifland ruled last september that arbitration would usurp the 
bankruptcy courts role in easterns reorganization and thwart 
the goal of judicial speed and economy necessary for 
rehabilitating the airline 
in sweets second ruling the pilots union was allowed to 
proceed with its suit in us district court in miami aimed at 
blocking easterns practice of leasing jets with crews known as 
wetleasing from continental the union had claimed the 
leases violated its contract with eastern because continental 
pilots have been used rather than eastern fliers 
last fall lifland issued an injunction against the unions 
suit maintaining it was an attempt to interfere with the 
bankruptcy courts jurisdiction 
a bankruptcy court hearing on the trustee issue was scheduled 
for friday morning at the same time lifland was slated to 
consider easterns request for 80 million to be withdrawn from 
escrow funds for operating expenses in the second quarter and some 
payments to creditors 
easterns unions have been attempting for some time to have a 
trustee appointed to replace frank lorenzo chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp the unions accuse lorenzo of funneling 
assets from eastern to continental and to texas air 
the committee of unsecured creditors who are owed 980 million 
agreed last week to reject the airlines latest reorganization 
proposal and seek the appointment of a trustee 
in formally filing its motion for a trustee tuesday the 
committee said easterns devastating constantly expanding and 
unending losses are extremely damaging to unsecured creditors 
the motion said eastern and texas air have been unable to 
project the results of easterns operations to the extent that 
the committee has lost confidence in their stewardship of the 
business 
bruce simon an attorney for the air line pilots association 
said he believes there is a very real possibility that lifland 
could decide at fridays hearing to name a trustee 
eastern spokeswoman karen ceremsak in miami reiterated the 
airlines position that there is no legal or policy basis for 
the appointment of a trustee she called the creditors motion a 
ruse that is being used as a negotiating tool 
ms ceremsak said sweets rulings were procedural rather 
than on the merits of the case 
art kent a texas air spokesman in houston said the creditors 
motion totally ignores the historical continuing and proposed 
support by texas air and continental of easterns recovery

a federal judge is trying to determine why 
government regulators and phoenix millionaire charles h keating 
jr put widely varied valuations on holdings in keatings collapsed 
real estate and savings and loan empire 
keating testifying tuesday in his suit to reclaim his 55 
billion lincoln savings and loan association seized by regulators a 
year ago estimated that the thrift was worth 500 million to 700 
million at the time 
regulators who seized the irvine calif thrift and its real 
estate holdings in arizona texas and louisiana contend that 
taxpayers eventually will have to absorb up to 2 billion in losses 
of federally insured deposits that keating used to finance his 
empire 
the government says its 2 billion in the red and the former 
operator says its 600 million in the black us district judge 
stanley sporkin said tuesday im in a quandary lets get the 
receiver in here 
representatives of the federal deposit insurance corp the 
receiver that took over lincoln and downgraded its value are to 
testify next week 
in a civil suit accusing keating and a dozen associates of fraud 
and racketeering regulators allege that lincoln inflated the value 
of its real estate holdings and loans far beyond a price they would 
command on the open market 
however keating in his fourth day on the witness stand put 
the blame for the entire sampl crisis on thrift regulators 
undervaluing sampl holdings and loans he said it caused a panic in 
the real estate market that brought about a selffulfilling 
prophecy 
theres no question that the economy of phoenix has been 
wrecked in the cause of thrift regulation keating testified 
todays market is not a happy situation because the government 
now owns 20 billion of arizona real estate that its dumping on 
the market 
as an example he pointed to the luxurious phoenician resort 
that using lincoln funds he built outside phoenix at a cost of 
275 million lincoln later sold a 45 percent interest in the 
phoenician and another hotel in phoenix to interests in kuwait for 
170 million 
keating estimated that lincolns 55 percent interest in hotel is 
now worth 190 million almost double the 99 million asset value 
listed by government regulators on their books if the development 
potential of adjacent land is considered 
its a complete misunderstanding of value to write that hotel 
down he said you cant just take a piece of dirt in the 
desert and sell it as a piece of dirt you have to look at what it 
was put there for its highest and best use 
james murphy representing the treasury departments office of 
thrift supervision in the suit said keatings testimony on the 
valuation of the property was vague 
we cant look at what an asset is worth in 10 years he 
said we have to look at what we could get for it today if the 
assets arent greater than the liabilities an sampls insolvent 
thats the definition of insolvency 
keating is expected to spend at least another two days on the 
witness stand in the evidentiary hearing which began in january 
and has now consumed more than 20 full days of courtroom time 
murphy said he plans to call four rebuttal witness next week 
including the fdic representatives that sporkin wants to testify 
the judge said tuesday he wanted to hear closing arguments in 
the case in june

a deepsea search will be conducted for the 
cargo door that blew off a united airlines jet even though 
investigators determined why nine people were sucked out of the 
airliner over the pacific ocean officials say 
the national transportation safety board voted 30 tuesday to 
blame united the boeing co and the federal aviation 
administration for failure to correct problems with the door of the 
jumbo jet before the feb 24 1989 incident aboard flight 811 
an aviation lawyer meanwhile said the boards conclusions 
should spur the faa into acting more quickly to correct dangerous 
deficiencies in airliners 
ntsb investigators said inspection of the door that popped off 
at 22000 feet carrying a section of fuselage and nine people with 
it still could provide evidence for improving aircraft safety 
a sophisticated navy probe unit will be lowered into the ocean 
in june said board accident investigator ron schleed if it can 
spot the door another device will be dispatched to recover it he 
said 
if they dont find it within 12 to 15 days thatll be the end 
of it schleed said 
the board concluded that even without the door it had enough 
evidence to determine the probable cause of the incident the 
sudden opening of the improperly latched forward lower lobe cargo 
door in flight and the subsequent explosive decompression 
flight 811 returned to honolulu after the harrowing incident on 
a scheduled flight to new zealand five other passengers were 
seriously hurt and 33 received minor injuries when the plane 
decompressed the flight carried a crew of 18 and 337 passengers 
the ntsb cited united for failing to maintain and inspect the 
door properly it said boeing and the faa failed to take timely 
corrective action after a door on a pan american boeing 747 popped 
partially open over the atlantic in 1987 
contributing to the cause of the flight 811 accident was a 
deficiency in the design of the cargo door locking mechanisms 
which made them susceptible to inservice damage and which allowed 
the door to be unlatched yet to show a properly latched and locked 
position the board said 
the latch indicator systems would be changed with an imminent 
faa order that would require detectors on the locks investigators 
said 
the ntsb issued a list of recommendations to ensure that cargo 
doors are properly latched and that passengers can be safety 
evacuated from an aircraft it also recommended that emergency 
vehicles at the honolulu airport be painted in highly visible 
colors rather than military camouflage patterns that cannot be seen 
at night 
ntsb conclusions and recommendations carry no judicial weight 
and its determination of a probable cause may not be introduced as 
evidence in court cases 
lawyer arthur wolk of philadelphia who has brought several 
cases against airlines and manufacturers for safety deficiencies 
praised the ntsb findings as the first time the board has come up 
with the right conclusion and the right cause of an accident 
it shows they have the courage to assess blame properly 
said wolk hopefully this will lead to greater faa oversight of 
the industry which is seeing steppedup production he and other 
safety advocates have criticized the faa for giving airlines too 
long to correct cargo door deficiencies and other problems 
if you dont act in an immediate fashion when you deal with 
aviation youre going to kill somebody wolk said 
united spokesman robert dowdy said the airline properly 
maintained and inspected the door of the plane used for flight 811 
although he acknowledged that a required december 1988 inspection 
was omitted because of a clerical error 
boeing had recommended that the board conclude that probable 
cause of the incident could not be determined 
in seattle boeing spokesman jack gamble noted that changes have 
been made in the doors and in inspection processes since the 
accident 
all of the necessary actions have been taken to ensure 
integrity of that doors operation in flight he said

job security isnt a key issue only for the 
united auto workers in this summers contract talks uaw president 
owen bieber says its also critical to the big three automakers 
hopes of arresting their sliding fortunes he says 
threatening workers with more insecurity and more cutbacks 
will merely continue the downward spiral our companies are on 
bieber said tuesday during the opening session of a threeday 
bargaining conference of the unions skilled trades department 
the union meets in kansas city next month to chart a course for 
bargaining in july with general motors corp ford motor co and 
chrysler corp 
the big three have blamed sluggish car sales for the temporary 
or permanent closing of assembly plants during the current 
contract thousands of auto workers have been laid off because of 
the companies actions 
the uaw wants that to end 
they can and they must work with us for success starting from 
the firm foundation of a secure work force bieber said this 
search for a firm foundation will be at the heart of our collective 
bargaining program and many other demands will flow from it 
resolutions up for debate during the conference include job 
security training health and safety plant closings wages and 
education 
americas industrial challenge is not a little bit 
managements fault and a little bit the unions fault bieber 
said its managements failures plain and simple that have put 
us in the precarious situation we face in so many sectors today 
the 1million member union has been shrinking as the automakers 
trim their operations plants have closed because of slow sales 
some work performed by uaw members has been sent to mexico or 
overseas and automakers have laid off employees as they seek to 
maintain profitability 
the meeting that began tuesday is one of several held by the uaw 
across the country prior to the unions bargaining convention may 
2124 in kansas city at that meeting delegates from all 1200 uaw 
locals gather to determine priorities in the national contract 
talks 
the unions skilled trades department has jurisdiction over 
workers such as tool and die makers drafting employees and 
designers who have more technically oriented jobs than other 
factory workers skilled trades employees are paid more than 
others such as assemblers 
the uaw opens negotiations in july with each of the big three 
automakers later in the summer the union will focus its efforts 
on one company the agreement with that company will serve as a 
pattern for contracts with the other two 
a potential contract issue that appears to be gaining steam 
within the union is costofliving protection for retirees which 
doesnt exist in current auto contracts 
the big three have an aging work force one that is more 
conscious of retirement programs than the much younger employees at 
the largely nonunion us assembly plants operated by japanese 
companies 
none of the 20 resolutions up for debate during this weeks 
skilled trades workers conference specifically mentions 
costofliving adjustments in retirees benefits 
bieber did not specifically mention the issue in his speech but 
at a news conference he said the bottom line is that we have 
taken care of our past retirees and will continue to do it now

a small us computer company is launching a 
daring plan to sell pcs in japan introducing a machine it claims 
offers more features than the homegrown models that dominate the 
japanese market 
ast research inc a decadeold irvine company planned to 
unveil its new machine today in tokyo 
the dual sx16 runs programs designed for ibm corp pcs and also 
for machines made by nec corp the japanese computer giant that 
dominates its home market much more than ibm does here nec has an 
estimated 70 percent of the japanese pc market 
i think its a bold move on the part of ast said sam 
albert a 30year ibm executive who now heads his own computer 
consulting firm in scarsdale ny 
pc makers such as ast have multiplied in recent years and now 
are struggling to set themselves apart from the rest ive got to 
believe theres at least 10 makers such as ast albert said 
its clear that compaq and ibm are on the dealers shelves 
and theres only so much shelf space he said the market is 
getting crowded in the united states and people are looking for 
other shelves 
ast which lost 75 million on sales of 457 million last year 
believes it can find those shelves in japan the worlds 
secondbiggest market for pcs 
the company turned profitable again in the last few quarters 
after selling off its nonpc businesses and spokesman joel don 
said it is poised to move into eastern europe as well as asia 
a basic nec computer with no hard disk no monitor and a 
80386sx microprocessor from intel corp costs about 390000 yen 
or the equivalent of 2475 don said 
a similar nec clone computer made by japans seiko epson 
corp costs 328000 yen or about 2080 don said 
asts computer will be priced somewhere in between but 
officials said they believed it would still sell well because of 
its ability to run both the nec and ibm programs 
the japanese cannot say that the product is missing 
features ast president safi qureshey said in a telephone 
interview it counters the arguments that american companies are 
lazy just comfortable with the us market 
don said the company probably will build the first machines at 
its fountain valley plant in southern california then shift 
production to taiwan 
ast teamed with japans kawasaki steel corp and tomcat computer 
corp to develop the computer which will be sold under the brand 
names of japanese distributors ast is negotiating with several 
potential distributors including sharp corp don said 
asts machine will have a hard time making inroads into necs 
dominion because the japanese are so loyal to the company said tim 
bajarin of the santa clarabased creative strategies international 
computer consulting firm 
he noted that ibm and apple already sell computers in japan and 
suggested they might be the ones who lose japanese market share to 
ast 
qureshey and albert said they believed it likelier that the 
epson machines would be the losers 
my view is that the knockoff will take share away from the 
other knockoff albert said 
qureshey said ast will be happy with just a small chunk of the 
big japanese market 
nec is so dominant that a small percentage of their share 
means a lot to a small entrant he said

stockholders have rejected investor harold 
simmons plan to win control of lockheed corps board but the 
dallas billionaire says he was pleased with victories on 
shareholders rights issues 
it appears we achieved a clean sweep on the issues of 
confidential voting opting out of the delaware antitakeover law 
abolition of the poison pill and antigreenmail said simmons 
who controls about 19 percent of lockheed stock 
the shareholders have spoken clearly on these issues and we 
will expect lockheeds board of directors to take prompt action to 
implement the shareholders wishes he said 
simmons who owns 189 percent of lockheeds common stock had 
sought to replace company directors with his own nominees after his 
request for representation had been turned down 
citing preliminary tallies simmons said the four shareholders 
rights proposals each received 57 percent to 97 percent of the 
votes cast at last months annual shareholders meeting incumbent 
lockheed directors were reelected with between 58 percent and 61 
percent of the votes each he said 
lockheed maker of the stealth fighter and other military 
hardware said its directors won with 62 percent of the overall 
vote and 78 percent of the vote of shareholders not controlled by 
simmons the company also confirmed the outcome of the 
shareholders rights provisions but did not reveal specifics 
the election was conducted at the companys march 29 annual 
meeting in burbank calif the results announced tuesday are 
preliminary and final figures wont be available until monday 
of the four proposals only the one requiring the company to opt 
out of delawares strict takeover statute is binding 
the three others are all advisory although lockheed chairman 
daniel tellep said during the annual meeting that he would work to 
implement the confidentiality proposals if supported by a 
significant minority of voters 
despite the binding nature of the proposal tellep said tuesday 
the board would have to review the poison pill provisions he 
said he is concerned abandoning the pill would leave the company 
vulnerable to hostile takeovers 
lockheeds poison pill kicks in once an investor acquires 20 
percent of the companys stock it allows other shareholders to 
purchase additional stock at lower prices diluting the large 
investors holdings 
under the takeover law in delaware where lockheed is 
incorporated companies can chose to adopt other provisions that 
make hostile takeovers more difficult and expensive including 
limits on sales and mergers involving the company 
the antigreenmail proposal would prohibit lockheed from buying 
back its own stock at a premium from selected investors instead 
all shareholders must be able to cash in on the higher prices 
simmons had undertaken the proxy fight after accumulating the 
lockheed shares and watching his 530 million investment drop 100 
million in value 
tellep and the company fought simmons claiming he had no 
experience running a defense or aerospace company 
simmons insisted the company could be managed better and urged 
lockheed to improve profits at noncore business or sell them 
simmons who won some large institutional investors to his side 
attributed the loss in the directors races to lockheeds employee 
stock ownership plan the esop holds 19 percent of the companys 
stock 90 percent of which was cast for company nominees he said 
the esop was created last year after simmons began buying 
lockheed stock through his houstonbased nl industries inc 
we feel we did very well for our first try simmons said 
last year for example confidential voting received 35 percent 
of the votes and this year it received about 60 percent support 
last year 27 percent of the votes were cast in favor of opting out 
of the delaware antitakeover statute this year the proposal 
garnered over 60 percent

casting its vote in the growing debate over oil 
tanker safety conoco inc said it will switch to doublehull 
tankers to help guard against spills like last years catastrophe 
in alaskas prince william sound 
conoco said it had placed an order for two doublehull oil 
tankers and would order only twinhull vessels in the future 
the step was part of a ninepoint environmental program the 
company unveiled tuesday that also included efforts to reduce toxic 
air emissions 
we are in the business by the publics consent said 
constantine s nicandros conoco president and chief executive 
officer we are sincere in our concern for the air water and 
land of our planet as a matter of enlightened selfinterest 
oil companies have faced increasing pressure to switch to 
doublehull tankers since the exxon valdez ran aground gushing 
nearly 11 million gallons of crude into alaskan waters in the 
nations worst spill ever many politicians and environmentalists 
claim a second hull might have averted the spill 
many oil industry officials have argued against twinhull 
vessels claiming that they could be less stable than conventional 
tankers if their outer hull is pierced 
several panels are studying the issue including the american 
academy of sciences which set to release a report this summer 
but nicandros said we cannot wait for a verdict from the 
study 
we realize that doubledhulled tankers are not the total 
solution but they do offer an increase margin of protection 
against oil spills he was quoted as saying in the new york times 
the newspaper quoted conoco officials as saying they believe it 
was the first american oil company to place an order for a 
twinhull tanker 
as part of its plan the company also said it would 
support the creation of citizen advisory councils at all major 
installations worldwide to monitor environmental performance 
reward top managers for emphasizing and implementing plans 
that benefit the environment and penalize lack of performance in 
the area 
provide double containment systems at all newly constructed 
and renovated gasoline outlets 
intensify research and development of fuels that improve the 
environment 
create yearlong environmental fellowships to let several 
outsiders work within the company on environmental matters 
emphasize environmental sensitivities in developing oil and 
gas discoveries 
work toward recycling all waste generated at conocos

dozen years later he decided he had had enough quit his agency 
and left the business 
he asked for bids on his collection of cars and art sold the 
midtown manhattan apartment and dismissed the butler he went off 
to drive in a transcontinental automobile race he wrote a book 
about his adventures 
and now ed mccabe is back 
the former president and creative director of the scali mccabe 
sloves advertising agency that created awardwinning campaigns 
ranging from durable cars to tender chickens said tuesday he has 
joined the regional ad agency beber silverstein amp partners of miami 
mccabe 51 will become a creative partner and the agency is 
changing its name to beber silverstein mccabe amp partners 
id been in advertising for 32 years and that is a long time 
to do any one thing without a break mccabe said in an interview 
of his decision to quit the ad business in late 1986 
he had no intention of getting back into it but said in 
three years of looking around i havent found anthing else i would 
want to do 
mccabe is probably best known for creating the commercials for 
perdue chicken that used the line it takes a tough man to make a 
tender chicken the ads helped build the brand and made a 
celebrity of founder frank perdue

agency in london and looked into starting a film production

frustrated by unsuccessful efforts to assist the losing 
presidential campaign of democrat michael dukakis 
he went back to london to finish the book in late 1988 and 
returned to the united states last summer to consider his options 
he decided against starting his own agency because i did that 
once and against returning to his old agency now a part of 
britishbased wpp group plc 
joyce beber one of the founders of beber silverstein 18 years 
ago said she had known mccabe for years and approached him earlier 
this year about the possibilities of building a regional agency 
into a national agency 
i guess i piqued his interest she said 
beber silverstein handles 70 million in annual billings for a 
number of clients including humana health services florida power 
amp light first florida banks and floridagold orange juice 
the agency also claims credit for casting leona helmsley as 
the queen in ads for her helmsley hotels the agency was fired 
in 1987 mrs helmsley no longer appears in the ads she was 
convicted on tax evasion charges last year 
mccabe will split his time between the miami and new york 
offices and will be chairman of the new york office 
he is an extraordinary talent and im rooting for him said 
marvin sloves who founded scali mccabe with mccabe and remains 
with that agency 
mccabe said he hopes to help create on the great indepedent 
regional agencies in the country while having some fun and making 
some money 
he said the most creative ad work is no longer coming from new 
york city but from places like portland ore richmond va and 
san fancisco 
i dont see why miami shouldnt be right at the top of that 
list he said

the us justice department said it has 
entered into a consent decree with norton co and baker hughes 
inc removing the final obstacles to nortons planned 550 million 
sale of eastman christenson co to baker hughes 
the companies said tuesday they expected to close the sale 
within the next few days 
to allow the sale to move forward justice department officials 
required baker hughes a houston texasbased energy products and 
services company to sell the diamond drill bit business of the 
hughes tool co 
last year the division sold 17 million in drills said ron 
turner corporate vice president at baker hughes turner said 
several parties had expressed an interest in buying the product 
line but nothing was settled he declined to name the potential 
buyers 
eastman christenson also makes diamond drill bits but on a 
bigger scale turner said last year the drills earned the company 
40 million in sales he said 
the part of the eastman business that is not in contention 
is a very important part of it turner said 
the consent decree stipulates that if the drill business is not 
sold by aug 6 the business must be placed under the oversight of 
a trustee to manage and sell the company for baker hughes 
thats just a legal provision in case the management of the 
company decides to stonewall it a provision that if you dont do 
it we will turner said 
norton a leading maker of abrasives such as grinding tools and 
sandpaper is a target of a 16 billion 75 a share hostile 
takeover bid from the british conglomerate btr plc 
the norton board of directors has rejected the offer but btr 
plc has threatened to take control of the board at the companys 
upcoming annual meeting 
frank doherty a norton spokesman denied the eastman 
christenson sale had anything to do with defensive maneuvering 
its not related to btr we announced it dec 15th and this is 
just the final step doherty said it just happens to be 
completed now

bechtel group inc has won a contract from 
the hong kong government to manage a 16 billion construction 
project scheduled for completion in 1997 when the chinese 
government will take over hong kong from england 
the company announced the contract tuesday but did not disclose 
how much it would be paid to oversee and coordinate the project 
which is to include a new airport the worlds longest suspension 
bridge a harbor tunnel and a rail transit system 
michael k stephenson a bechtel senior vice president said the 
company purposely focused on taking an oversight role rather than 
that of a contractor in making its bid 
our track record and world experience in moving major 
megaprojects together on time and within budget was one of the 
factors in winning the contract stephenson said 
stephen d bechtel jr company chairman said in a memo to 
employees the development is comparable to saudi arabias jubail 
industrial city in complexity and diversity 
bechtels plans to manage the hong kong project rank second only 
to the companys involvement in the creation of the saudi arabian 
city the largest construction project in history bechtel became 
involved in the saudi arabian city still being built in the late 
1970s

the government sold 35 billion of 40year 
bonds to finance the bailout of the savings and loan industry but 
traders said the auction was disappointing 
the bonds were sold tuesday at an average yield of 889 percent 
up from 860 percent at the last auction jan 23 the bonds will 
carry a coupon interest rate of 8 percent with a 10000 bond 
selling for 998340 
the resolution funding corp or refcorp received bids totaling 
890 billion compared with 817 billion in bids in january for 
what was a larger issue of 5 billion 
nevertheless traders said the bonds were poorly received the 
government could not sell all of the bonds at the low bid of 886 
percent and had to sell some for as much as 894 percent 
it was a poor reception said economist robert brusca of 
nikko securities co international inc 
he said bond buyers were worried about the extra interest rate 
risk of the longer maturity they were fearful that the sampl problem 
is worse than anticipated and the government will have to flood the 
market with borrowing he said 
treasury department officials had been hoping institutional 
investors such as pension funds would show more demand for the 
longer maturity thus allowing the government to offer a lower 
interest rate 
legislation in august authorized the government to borrow 30 
billion through refcorp an arrangement that keeps the spending out 
of the budget deficit 
refcorp has now borrowed 13 billion the first bond auction 
for 45 billion in 30year bonds was in october

plans by the parent company of credit 
suisse to take a majority stake in 235yearold bank leu ag signals 
the onset of a consolidation of switzerlands banking industry 
analysts and bankers said 
cs holding parent of the countrys no 3 commercial bank credit 
suisse and bank leu the fifthbiggest bank and the oldest major 
swiss bank announced tuesday they are holding talks aimed at 
setting up a new holding company 
the holding company which would be listed on stock exchanges 
would include bank leu and two small cs holding investment 
management companies bank hofmann and clariden bank with all 
units retaining their identities 
nikolaus senn president of union bank of switzerland predicted 
further mergers in the swiss banking industry will follow 
the pace of concentration will even intensify the head of 
switzerlands biggest commercial bank said 
the high cost of competing internationally will lead to deep 
changes in swiss and european banking zurich financial analyst 
thomas braun said 
big banks will swallow the smaller ones and the small ones 
will band together he said 
bank leu with assets of 15 billion francs the equivalent of 
about 10 billion has faced takeover rumblings in the past it has 
recently undergone a management shakeup and corporate 
restructuring and analysts say it has improved potential to 
develop its private client base 
the joint announcement said cs holding group has built up a 
substantial shareholding in bank leu over the past two years 
it did not reveal the size of the stake 
shares of the new holding company would be swapped for equities 
of bank leu at a ratio to be set later and cs holding would end 
up with a majority interest in the new concern 
assuming that cs holding controls at least half of the voting 
shares of leu analysts estimated the value of the stake at up to 1 
billion swiss francs or about 675 million dollars

usx corp says it is considering shuttering the 
remnants of its rusting south works steel mill a move that would 
idle 700 workers unless union officials agree to major concessions 
by the end of the year 
the struggling chicago facility cant compete with new nonunion 
plants unless fixed costs are substantially reduced said usx 
chairman charles corry 
the company wants workers to give up benefits and jobs under a 
new labor contract to take effect jan 1 
but union leaders angrily rejected corrys plea for concessions 
my position is they can go to hell said willie ross 
president of united steelworkers of america local 65 on tuesday 
they can close the damn thing it comes to the point where were 
giving and giving and giving and weve got nothing left to give 
south works once employed 18000 workers and has made steel 
since 1881 under usxs us steel co unit and predecessor 
companies 
once an integral part of chicagos heavy industry the plant 
fell victim to recession and a slump in the domestic steel industry 
all that remains amid vacant buildings on the 574acre facility 
are two electric furnaces and a mill that makes about 146 tons of 
raw steel each week technology there is more than a generation old 
the company has proposed eliminating a shift of workers and 
allowing other shops to finish business a move that would trim 
union employment to 300 workers ross said 
corry says the company needs the concessions to compete with 
new smaller mills that make finished steel from scrap at lower 
costs 
the socalled mini mills like the nonunion nucor corp of 
charlotte nc and northwestern steel amp wire of sterling ill 
are expanding and analysts say theyll likely crowd the 
marketplace 
thats going to play havoc for the market said christopher 
plummer an analyst with wefa group in bala cynwyd pa 
clearly the writing is on the wall for minimills to be 
taking a significant portion of the market in the future and 
somebodys going to have to drop out eventually plummer said 
we want to be in it if we can earn return on our investment 
corry said if you were to tell me we were going to lose money in 
structural the next three years id say its not a business we 
want to be in

grain and soybean futures were mostly higher in 
early trading today on the chicago board of trade partly in 
reaction to a government report indicating the nations grain 
stockpiles are shrinking 
gains in the soybean market were limited by pronounced weaknes 
in the soybean meal pit where traders sold futures contracts amid 
expectations for an increase in brazilian meal exports 
in a report released after the close of tuesdays trading the 
agriculture department substantially lowered its forecasts for 
ending stocks of us corn and soybeans and slightly reduced its 
wheat stocks projection

sept 1 soybean stocks were pegged at 305 million bushels 
compared with the march projection of 330 million 
the usda projected june 1 wheat stocks at 442 million bushels 
compared with last months estimate of 443 million 
brazilian exports of soybean meal are expected to increase due 
to a 15 percent devaluation of that countrys currency making 
brazilian meal cheaper on the world market said victor lespinasse 
a trader with dean witter reynolds inc in chicago 
in early trading wheat futures prices were cent lower to 4 
cents higher with the contract for delivery in may at 366 a

industrialist william farley plans to surrender 
majority ownership of west pointpepperell inc by proposing a 
debtequity swap to reduce the costs of his troubled takeover 
efforts a newspaper reported today 
farley who holds 95 percent of the textile giants stock is 
offering certain debt holders a combined stake of 65 percent in a 
restructured version of pepperell the wall street journal 
reported citing sources it did not identify 
the transfer would help reduce and delay certain interest 
payments and might be the only way farley can avoid bankruptcy the 
journals sources said 
farley couldnt be reached for immediate comment the spokesmen 
at the farley inc headquarters in chicago were traveling today a 
secretary said and they did not return telephone messages 
the arrangement would create a new parent company west point 
holdings corp which would hold the stock in the operating unit 
the newspaper said although the new entity would apparently be a 
unit of farley inc the debtequity swap would leave farley a 
minority shareholder according to the journal 
the newspaper said it was not clear whether the preferred shares 
held by farley would allow him to retain control of pepperell but 
it said its believed he would keep majority control of the boards 
of directors at west point holdings and the pepperell operating 
unit 
farley acquired control of pepperell in march 1989 and holds 95 
percent of the companys stock but he has had trouble raising 
about 83 million needed to acquire the remaining 5 percent 
the newspaper said his bankers are likely to lend him the cash 
needed to complete the deal if certain debt holders agree to the 
debtforequity plan 
meantime analysts said the 965 million sale of pepperells 
sanderson subsidiary wont be of much help to farley georgiabased 
pepperell on tuesday announced the sale of its uk division 
arthur sanderson and sons ltd to the dutch textile group gamma 
holding nv 
it looks like a very good price said richard j byrne of 
merrill lynch amp co in new york it helps but its a small step 
they need to complete the merger 
he is still highly leveraged said rich mercier of standard 
amp poor the 965 million is not a meaningful number when youre 
talking over 2 billion in debt 
the collapse of the junk bond market has dealt a severe blow to 
farleys expansion plans last week the farley subsidiary formed 
to acquire pepperell announced it had defaulted on 15 billion 
worth of loan and bond payments 
farley has been trying to restructure a 796 million loan 
obtained from a consortium of banks for the pepperell buyout 
farleys other properties include fruit of the loom inc and 
acme boots pepperell manufactures apparel and bedding sold under 
such brands as ralph lauren martex lady pepperell esprit and 
utica

the dollar ended european dealings wednesday 
broadly weaker in part because of renewed interest in the west 
german mark 
gold prices declined 
the dollar was quoted at 16735 west german marks late in 
london down sharply from 16900 marks late tuesday 
earlier in tokyo the dollar rose 035 japanese yen to a 
closing 15850 yen later in london it was quoted at 15815 yen 
a flurry of dollar selling against the yen by some european 
central banks breathed some life into an otherwise dull european 
session the intervention which came in early afternoon had 
little impact on the dollars level against the yen 
while dealers saw the intervention as orders executed on behalf 
of the bank of japan rather than any concerted effort by the group 
of seven g7 nations to stem yen weakness they also noted that 
japanese commercial buying was among the more active features in 
the european day 
if we hadnt had the intervention i think the market would 
have died earlier said michael james head of interbank dealing 
for midland bank we could be in for some quiet range trading 
over the next few weeks

the opening of the fifth annual macworld 
exposition was greeted eagerly within computer circles but product 
developers at the convention hall expressed uncertainty about the 
market for macintosh computers 
industry insiders in attendance tuesday complained there was 
little groundbreaking technology at the show which usually 
features hot new products and applications for the apple computer 
inc machine 
i dont know of anything really exciting thats going on so i 
dont know if the market is going to be able to grow this year 
said mike slade macintosh products manager for microsoft corp of 
redmond wash the leading supplier of macintosh software 
according to macintosh product developers growth in the 
macintosh market will remain crippled until apple comes to market 
with a lowcost mac 
the technical strength is at the high end and there are 
people who will always buy that said michael mcconnell 
president of supermac technology inc a sunnyvale supplier of 
macintosh monitors and software 
but the high end is now where the volumes are and in the long 
run the macintosh wont become a mainstream computer without a 
lowend product said mcconnell 
according to infocorp a santa clara market research company 
macintosh shipments are expected to increase only 8 percent this 
year to 749000 units last year sales grew 34 percent to 693000 
units 
at the convention some products did manage to draw attention 
aaps corp headed by atari corp and pizzatime theater founder 
nolan bushnell displayed its digivideo computer board which 
allows a macintosh to act as a video cassette recorder the 
98channel tuner which costs 595 and video recorder may be 
important to desktop publishers who use video images 
supermac technology inc unveiled the first 21inch color 
monitor for a mac the color monitor priced at 4799 could 
become a popular item for sophisticated publishing systems that

energy futures prices continued to slide in 
early trading today but managed to recoup some of their losses 
the contract for may delivery of west texas intermediate the 
benchmark grade of us crude oil was down 25 cents to 1743 a 
barrel in early afternoon on the new york mercantile exchange after 
having fallen 147 over monday and tuesday the may contract fell 
as much as 143 in early trading today before regaining some 
ground 
refined products traded on the merc also fell today 
the may contract for unleaded regular gasoline was down 113 
cents to 5730 a gallon after a drop of 368 cents over monday and 
tuesday gasoline followed the lead of crude recovering some of 
its losses after falling 283 cents earlier 
home heating oil for may delivery was down 005 cent to 5235 
cents a gallon after slipping 131 cents over monday and tuesday 
heating oil fared the best among petroleum futures today retracing 
most of its steps after having fallen 240 cents in early trading 
energy futures prices have fallen in recent weeks to their 
lowest levels in more than a year analysts blame the decline on 
plentiful supplies and production while demand has been weaker than 
expected 
the analysts cited reports that indicate the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries has been producing an average 24 
million barrels of oil a day that is above the ceiling of 221 
million barrels a day that opec members agreed on for production in 
the first half of this year 
some opec members led by the united arab emirates and kuwait 
have been ignoring their production quotas and calling for their 
abolition 
another factor cited by analysts is the end of normal 
maintenance periods for many us oil refineries which are 
expected to increase their output 
at the same time the analysts said demand for oil has been weak 
with big customers either placing smaller orders because of weak 
business conditions or postponing purchases in anticipation of 
further price declines 
meanwhile natural gas for june delivery was quoted at 1605 
per million british thermal units today on the merc down from 
1620 on tuesday

largest industrial company to agree last month to adopt an 
antigreenmail policy shed been pushing since 1986 when the 
automaker paid 700 million to texas businessman h ross perot so 
he would leave gms board of directors 
greenmail a play on the term blackmail is a companys 
repurchase of its own stock from a corporate takeover strategist 
or other unwanted stockholder at a price above the fair market rate 
shareholder activists such as davis complain that these payments 
are unfair and unnecessary expenditures made by executives more 
concerned with keeping their own jobs than increasing shareholders 
dividends 
sometimes it takes that type of person or that type of 
approach to get managements attention said ralph whitworth 
director of united shareholders association a washingtonbased 
shareholders rights group 
i think some of the things she has done have been 
constructive said whitworth whose own group has advocated 
proposals it says are intended to keep management honest and 
responsible 
its unfortunate that management has been able to put in place 
the belief that anyone who gets up and asks a question at a meeting 
is a gadfly he said 
davis doesnt mind 
a gadfly with a fortune she reminded in an emphatic voice 
still heavy with the accent of her native amsterdam you know 
this stuff has made me quite wealthy she said 
but what i like too is this power that this gives me the 
power thats really what life is all about she said its all 
how you use it its better than being a nonentity i couldnt 
stand being a nonentity 
davis however is not just another eccentric comfortablyfixed 
senior citizen with a few shares of stock and time on her hands 
shes a millionaire a couple of times over with small holdings 
in about 120 blue chip companies ranging from the big three 
automakers to ibm cbs inc and usx corp 
the seed money came from some securities left by her late father 
and settlements from two divorces 
my stocks are my children said davis who is childless i 
sort of just fell into it 
her early personal history remains somewhat of a mystery and 
davis is reluctant to talk about it she emigrated to the united 
states after world war ii she studied business administration at 
george washington university and said she honed her public speaking 
skills with a 20 ymca course 
from a tiny windowless office in washingtons watergate complex 
she publishes an annual newsletter called highlights and 
lowlights sold only to top corporate executives which she says 
earns about 250000 a year 
i started from nothing the first few copies were maybe 20 
bucks a copy now i get 260 a copy with a minimum order of two 
copies its only sold to chairmen of the board and presidents 
she said i dont deal with flunkies 
the 20page newsletter is packed with corporate commentary 
social notes and eccentric punctuation that rivals superman comics 
for the number of exclamation points all vintage evelyn y davis 
who said the y does not stand for anything 
a sampling from the 1989 edition 
at one of the most important meetings of the year only one 
outside director the son of the founder attended time 
inc this showed disrespect for the chairman the stockholders 
and other attendees 
what happened in china was very unfortunate indeed but 
business must go on as usual as long as we have diplomatic 
relations with a country we should continue to do business even 
with unpopular regimes 
in mexico city and acapulco one still has to worry about the 
food and water we were there once before in 1966 with all the 
taxpayers money that is going to mexico why not insist that it is 
spent on water purification 
despite her vociferous push for shareholder rights davis 
remains largely a loner with no clearly defined political 
leanings but she bluntly has distanced herself from shareholder 
groups pushing social resolutions such as south african divestment 
and sensitivity to the environment 
after all a company is there to make money not to be 
socially responsible she said thats for the government to 
do 
davis office is cluttered with letters annual reports and some 
of the five newspapers she reads each day to keep tabs on her 
stocks as well as nearly 1000 other companies 
her yellow and blue plaid jacket is by valentino while the gold 
turtleneck dress beneath it is by nipon purchased at half price 
fashion is a hobby but only on sale she said 
davis seems equally willing to cause a scene with a waiter or a 
ceo as she demonstrated during a recent interview 
with a woman they say shes difficult and demanding with a 
man they wouldnt think so davis said after kicking up a fuss 
with a hapless waiter in the elegant brighton grill of the 
watergate where she lives in a cluttered threeroom apartment 
through her newsletter she has obtained press credentials that 
have given her access to newsmakers well beyond the corporate 
world for example she has a white house press identification and 
has popped a few questions to presidents reagan and bush 
but one of her proudest moments was what she termed a six 
minute chat with soviet leader mikhail gorbachev a few years ago 
in moscow where she had been invited as part of a ussoviet 
trade delegation 
during a banquet davis recalled she walked over to gorbachevs 
table and complained she hadnt been invited to a news conference 
he said hed look into it she said

futures prices of grain and soybeans seesawed to 
a mixed close wednesday on the chicago board of trade corn futures 
turned in a surprisingly weak performance in light of a shrinking 
national corn stockpile 
traders had expected corn futures to rally after tuesdays 
monthly agriculture department supplyanddemand report which 
projected sept 1 corn stocks of 133 million bushels down from 
marchs estimate of 148 billion 
the usda also lowered its estimates of wheat and soybean stocks 
but those numbers came close to market expectations 
corn futures opened lower and quickly turned higher but sold off 
again in the afternoon after traders tried and failed to bid prices 
above their previous contract highs said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
the contract for december delivery traded up to its lifetime 
high of 263 a bushel but the rally failed at that point 
prompting speculative profittaking lespinasse said 
at the close of trading wheat futures were unchanged to 2 
cents higher with the contract for delivery in may at 364 a 
bushel corn was 1 cents lower to cent higher with may at 271 
a bushel oats were unchanged to cent lower with may at 150 a

where else but on wall street does a drastic pay 
cut still leave earnings of 155 million a year 
that was the salary and bonus for merrill lynch amp co chairman 
william a schreyer down 38 percent from 25 million in 1988 it 
was no surprise because the nations no 1 brokerage lost money 
for the first time since going public in 1971 
in a bad year for the securities industry cash compensation for 
highly paid top executives reflected the fortunes of individual 
firms proxy statements issued by publicly owned brokerages show 
some firms did better than others in coping with a downturn in 
stock trading mergers and takeovers and other barometers of wall 
streets financial health payouts ballooned accordingly 
at morgan stanley amp co which made a 443 million profit the 
top three executives took home 5475 million apiece a 26 percent 
raise over 1988 not including free stock they may have cashed in 
morgans top five made more than 3 million each its eight 
executive officers combined to make 287 million 
top executives at wall street firms usually are paid according 
to the firms performance receiving a minimum salary and a bonus 
payouts are set by compensation committees that include directors 
and executives 
but stock awards and options given to top executives generally 
inflate earnings so in spite of lower cash payouts the upper 
echelons generally do better than the rest of their firms wall 
street analysts said 
those ceos that have earned less money have probably suffered 
in a lesser proportion than the rest of the firm joan zimmerman 
executive vice president at gz stephens inc a wall street 
executive recruiting firm said wednesday 
overall bonuses below the executive level on wall street last 
year were flat to down 20 percent recruiters said and were as 
much as 50 percent lower in some areas a 10 percent bonus hike 
considered peanuts in the booming mid1980s last year was a sign 
of high regard 
despite merrills bad year the firm lost 213 million in 1989 
four executives still made more than 1 million compared with 
seven executives the year before 
when things dont go well they still make a lot of money but 
they make a little less than when they do go well said gary 
goldstein president of the whitney group another search firm 
members of the morgan troika chairman s parker gilbert 
president richard b fisher and vice chairman robert f greenhill 
each were outearned by ernst weil an executive vice president at 
salomon inc who received 64 million 
weils compensation represented a 60 percent pay raise and 
didnt include a 16 million deferred bonus to be paid over two 
years according to salomons proxy statement 
what made weil salomons top executive let alone the highest 
paid of wall streets boardroom bigwigs he runs salomons phibro 
energy oil trading and refining subsidiary which was responsible 
most of salomons profits in an otherwise mediocre year 
salomon chairman john h gutfreund took a 500000 pay cut to 
35 million 
the philosophy on wall street has been you pay people to make 
you money said perrin long who follows the securities industry 
for lipper analytical services as long as theyre making the 
company money thats all thats important 
according to the proxies the biggest pay jump belonged to 
painewebber inc chairman donald b marron who was paid 205 
million 64 percent more than in 1988 the firms profits rose 23 
percent 
presidents and chairmen arent necessarily the bestpaid players 
on wall street traders who generate large amounts of business 
typically received bonuses commensurate with their performance 
an extreme example is former drexel lambert inc junk bond 
director michael milken who for more than a decade received a 
fixed percentage of income generated by the highyield bond 
division he was paid 550 million in 1987 alone 
wall street firms are expected to use the industry downturn as a 
reason for continuing to trim compensation in 1990 their largest 
expense analysts said 
the concern is that on average they will not be able in 1990 
to increase their revenue much if any yet costs continue to 
rise long said as a consequence profit margins are 
squeezed

the nations largest investor in home 
mortgages the federal national mortgage association on wednesday 
reported record first quarter profit of 277 million up 67 
percent from the same period last year 
fannie mae attributed the increase mostly to higher interest 
income on all investments and the success of mortgagebacked 
securities which surpassed last years firstquarter total by 54 
percent 
the firstquarter net income of 277 million or 106 a share 
compared with 165 million or 66 cents a share in the first 
quarter of 1989 
fannie maes ninth consecutive quarter of record earnings was 
based on solid fundamentals said chief executive officer david 
o maxwell we issued the largest volume of mortgagebacked 
securities in any first quarter and properties acquired through 
foreclosures dropped to their lowest level since peaking in 1987 
fannie mae foreclosed on 2455 properties in the first quarter 
of this year a 44 percent decline from the third quarter of 1987 
there were 2975 foreclosures in the first quarter of 1989 
the guaranty fees from these securities increased to 121 
million in the first quarter of 1990 from 111 million in the 
fourth quarter of 1989 and 94 million in the first quarter of 1989 
fannie mae also said earnings were up due to fees of 185 
million earned from issuing mortgage investment securities and 
stripped mortgagebacked securities this miscellaneous income in 
both the first and fourth quarters of 1989 was adversely affected 
by several nonrecurring charges the company said 
the congressionally chartered shareholderowned company 
reported 240530000 outstanding shares at the end of march

cbs inc said wednesday its broadcasts of the 
super bowl and the ncaa basketball tournament fueled a 52 percent 
increase in its firstquarter profit despite disappointing ratings 
for its prime time entertainment lineup 
but laurence a tisch the cbs president and chief executive 
said the companys secondhalf outlook is uncertain due to a 
sluggish national economy heightened competition for television 
viewers and higher sports rights costs 
cbs which operates the cbs television network and owns five tv 
stations said it earned 853 million or 331 per share in the 
three months ended march 31 compared with 561 million or 218 a 
share a year earlier 
revenue rose 16 percent to 851 million from 7306 million in 
1989 
the operating profit at the companys broadcast group climbed 89 
percent to 871 million 
the company said the broadcast of the super bowl pro football 
championship in january helped the television network report 
markedly higher sales and operating income for the quarter 
the network also benefitted from strong advertiser demand for 
time during the ncaa basketball tournament broadcasts and the shift 
into the first quarter of the tournaments semifinal games cbs 
said the championship game was played april 2 two days into the 
second quarter 
profitability of the cbs television stations was aided by the 
super bowl broadcast the company said 
tisch called the networks primetime ratings performance a 
disappointment the network generally has trailed both nbc and 
abc in the ratings for the evening audiences for the past three 
seasons networks can usually charge advertisers more when they 
have higher ratings 
the company said it had net interest income of 417 million in 
the latest quarter up from 394 million a year earlier 
its cash and marketable securities amounted to 29 billion at 
the end of the quarter cbs said it has generated the cash through 
sale over the past few years of several large businesses including 
its magazines records and music publishing operations 
in the past few months cbs has agreed to pay about 36 billion 
for rights to broadcast major league baseball pro football 
college basketball and the next two winter olympics

the dollar ended narrowly mixed wednesday in 
thin trading as dealers shrugged off continued efforts by some 
european central banks to shore up the japanese yen at the expense 
of the us currency 
gold prices fell 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold bullion for current 
delivery settled at 37430 a troy ounce down 70 cents from late 
tuesday republic national bank in new york quoted a late bid for 
gold at 37475 an ounce 75 cents lower 
currency dealers said the dollar selling against the yen by some 
european central banks had little impact on the dollars level 
against the yen which has been under pressure in recent weeks amid 
growing signs of a weakening japanese economy 
most dealers said they saw the intervention which followed a 
similar move on monday as orders executed on behalf of the bank of 
japan rather than any concerted effort by the group of seven 
industrialized nations to stem the yens weakness 
it was a token appearance said zlatko glamuzina chief 
dealer at the new york office of banco di sicilia if the central 
banks wanted to support the yen they should have sold their own 
currencies for yen because the yen is weak against all 
currencies 
trading was described as extremely thin wednesday because of the 
passover holiday and in advance of the upcoming easter holiday 
in tokyo where the global trading day begins the dollar rose 
035 japanese yen to close at 15850 yen it was later quoted at 
15815 yen in london and at 15795 yen in new york up from 15760 
yen late tuesday

decomposition of fireretardant plywood installed in townhouses 
in many east coast states is setting off a legal battle that could 
last years before the courts assign liability for repair bills 
officials said wednesday 
builders primarily used the fireresistant treated plywood in 
townhouses during the housing boom of the early 1980s said bill 
young the consumer affairs director for the washingtonbased 
national association of home builders 
builders in other parts of the nation used a code that had not 
yet permitted use of the treated plywood also known as frtp he 
said 
attorneys for builders and homeowner associations are suing 
dozens of wood treatment companies and homeowners warranty 
companies seeking payment of the 2000 to 3000 needed to replace 
the defective plywood in each of 1 million units young estimates 
have the treated product 
its such a mess a real monster lawsuit said peter 
reinhart an attorney representing one of new jerseys largest 
developers k hovnanian inc he said he expects the unraveling of 
the cases to take at least five years 
not all the plywood is defective researchers are conducting 
tests at the us forest products laboratory in madison wis to 
determine the weaker strains of treated plywood which young said 
was used in multifamily housing 
although lawsuits are pending in connecticut and florida new 
jersey seems to be a special focus of the litigation 45 lawsuits 
because the problem was first discovered there in 1987 said e 
richard kennedy a homeowner association attorney who is handling 
more than 30 cases in new jersey 
reinhart said k hovnanian began seeking relief in the courts 
after two workers were injured at a condominium in the town of 
lawrenceville when a roof gave way costing 750000 in repair 
reinhart blamed much of the legal fight on homeowner warranty 
corporations unwilling to pay for the repairs 
they say its not a major structural defect reinhart said 
its crazy all the homeowners are looking for is somebody to pay 
the repairs 
ken kanline the vice president of sales and marketing for 
washingtonbased homeowners warranty corp said the policies 
written since 1981 have not included roof sheathing as a major 
structural defect after the first year 
he said the company made its decision before problems arose with 
the plywood and because too often the warping was cosmetic 
you had a situation where in the sixth year of a home it 
wouldnt be a structural claim but it looked cosmetically 
unsightly he said 
kanline said the company had received about 120 claims from 
virginia and new jersey all of which were rejected 
new jersey state sen thomas paterniti introduced a bill in the 
legislature last week that would set up a state superfund to 
allow homeowners to collect repair money immediately 
the state department of community affairs is awaiting word from 
consultants on its proposed regulations that the plywood be able to 
withstand humidity of 100 percent and temperatures of at least 220 
degrees said department spokesman jay johnston 
homeowners of the units with the fireresistant treated plywood 
should not go up on the roof but instead check inside an attic for 
signs of decay experts say 
signs to look for are if the plywoods normal light creamy brown 
color has darkened if the plywoods smooth surface has turned 
brittle and splintery or if a white powdery substance is building 
up 
the white powder is a leeching of the salts used to make the 
plywood fire retardant heat on the roof as low as 150 degrees can 
prompt the decay young said 
charles lhommedieu the regional director for cnr realty and 
management co a property concern in teaneck nj said his 
company is continuing to investigate its projects for problems 
which could arise as time passes 
these roof systems are projected to start failing within six 
years he said 
young minimized the problems effect on housing prices 
emphasizing instead the problems created by the plywood for real 
estate agents 
i wouldnt say its significant in depressing prices young 
said it is a major concern for people who sell houses by law 
theyre required to disclose it that gets sort of messy for people 
who just find out about it

orange juice futures prices leaped wednesday on the new york 
cotton exchange after the government projected a smaller florida 
orange harvest than the market had expected 
on other commodity markets oil futures advanced ending a 
sixday price slide livestock and meat futures were mixed grains 
and soybeans were mixed and precious metals were mixed 
prices for future deliveries of frozen concentrated orange juice 
settled 195 cents to 485 cents higher in new york with the 
contract for delivery in may up 255 cents at 1983 a pound 
analysts said the runup was prompted mainly by the agriculture 
departments monthly orange crop report which contained the same 
harvest projections as in march 172 million 90pound boxes 
including 1031 million boxes from florida the report was released 
tuesday after the close of trading 
speculators were expecting an upward revision in the crop 
projections and had sold orange juice futures aggressively in the 
week prior to the report the may contract had fallen a total of 
745 cents in the five sessions ending tuesday 
tuesdays florida crop projection was about 30 percent below the 
198889 florida harvest of 1466 million boxes reflecting severe 
damage caused by a freeze around christmas 
the tightsupply situation created by the freeze has resulted in 
increased speculator activity and volatility in the orange juice 
futures market 
sandra kaul an analyst with shearson lehman hutton inc said 
there are indications a large number of speculators still hold 
short positions meaning contracts to deliver orange juice which 
could lead to more strong rallies as those traders cover their 
shorts by buying offsetting contracts 
there should be massive covering at some point ms kaul 
said we see explosive rallies in the near future toward at least 
210 to 220 
oil futures ended mostly higher on the new york mercantile 
exchange after a day of wild price swings linked to supply concerns 
prices veered lower as trading opened extending the steep 
losses posted in the six previous sessions but by late afternoon 
the market had recovered the days lost ground and had risen above 
tuesdays close 
analysts said the early move reflected the american petroleum 
institutes report released after the market closed tuesday that 
us crude oil inventories rose by a largerthanexpected 81 
million barrels last week 
but prices rebounded sharply later in the session after rumors 
circulated that opec nations were consulting by telephone and 
considering calling an emergency meeting to discuss the recent drop 
in oil prices 
west texas intermediate crude settled 29 cents lower to 38 cents 
higher with may at 1806 a barrel heating oil was 60 cent to

gasoline was 55 cent to 120 cents higher with may at 5958 cents 
a gallon 
live cattle futures reached a record high of 8040 cents a pound 
on the chicago mercantile exchange reflecting recordhigh prices 
paid for fed cattle in the southern plains 
the previous high posted in 1979 was 8025 cents a pound 
pork futures rose sharply with pork bellies surging the 
permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound after a weekly exchange 
report showed lowerthanexpected belly stocks 
live cattle finished 22 cent lower to 15 cent higher with 
april at 8037 cents a pound feeder cattle were unchanged to 30

pork bellies were 115 cents to 2 cents higher with may at 5780 
cents a pound 
futures prices of grain and soybeans seesawed to a mixed close 
on the chicago board of trade corn futures turned in a 
surprisingly weak performance in light of a shrinking national corn 
stockpile 
traders had expected corn futures to rally after tuesdays 
monthly agriculture department supplyanddemand report which 
projected sept 1 corn stocks of 133 billion bushels down from 
marchs estimate of 148 billion 
wheat futures settled unchanged to 2 cents higher with may at

at its ratings on about 71 billion in longterm public debt and 
preferred stock of time warner inc because of the media and 
entertainment giants new financial agreement with pathe 
communications corp 
standard amp poors one of the nations leading credit rating 
services said it was placing 15 billion in time warner debt and 
56 billion of its preferred stock on its creditwatch listing with 
negative implications 
the move is not an actual credit downgrade which if undertaken 
would increase time warners borrowing costs 
the action announced tuesday followed time warners 
announcement that it had agreed to help arrange 650 million of the 
12 billion that pathe would need to complete its acquistion of 
mgmua communications co 
sampp said in its statement that the arrangement amounted to a 
guarantee that is expected to increase time warners already 
substantial financial risk 
time warner took on about 106 billion in debt last year when 
the former time inc acquired warner communications inc 
the ratings agency said time warners own bank agreement calls 
for sizable repayments in march 1992 extendable to march 1993 
which will require refinancing in a now more difficult environment 
for financing highly leveraged deals 
in exchange for the financing time warner would obtain the 
right to acquire warrants that would amount to a 20 percent stake 
in the combined pathemgmua company at some point time warners 
warner bros studio also reportedly would enter into a support 
services agreement under which it would handle pathe and mgmua 
releases for distribution in theaters on television and on 
videocassettes 
in its own statement time warner said we believe strongly in 
the longterm worldwide benefits of our agreement both to warner 
bros and to pathe 
it said the value of the ua library which is being pledged as 
security for the financing significantly exceeds the 650 
million provided in this deal 
even as it placed time warner on creditwatch sampp said the 
agency continues to view time warners business positions 
cashgenerating capacity and asset values favorably despite the 
companys aggressive profile

communications corp wont be hurt by the hospitalization of the 
phone companys founder and chairman william g mcgowan 
mcgowan who had a heart transplant three years ago underwent 
exploratory chest surgery tuesday at presbyterianuniversity 
hospital in pittsburgh he was listed in fair condition wednesday

transplant but would not elaborate 
mcgowan 62 was expected to be hospitalized for five to seven 
days 
charles nichols an analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc said mcgowan is not in charge of daytoday operations at 
mci so his hospitalization should not be a blow to the company 
nichols said mci based in washington dc is run on a daily 
basis by its president and chief operating officer bert c roberts 
jr and its chief financial officer daniel f akerson 
i think mci is a very wellrun company with a very strong 
management team added charles schelke an analyst at smith 
barney harris upham amp co as important as mcgowan has been its 
certainly more than a oneman company 
interest in mcgowans surgery was heightened by mcis announced 
deal to acquire telecom usa inc the nations fourthlargest 
longdistance company mci the no 2 longdistance phone company 
after american telephone amp telegraph co announced the 125 
billion acquisition on monday 
the companys disclosure of mcgowans hospitalization came a day 
later 
mci officials knew monday that the chairman was scheduled to 
enter the hospital that night but decided to delay an announcement 
until more was known about his condition ms keegan said 
as soon as we knew how the surgery had gone we announced 
she said 
she said mcgowan presided over an mci board of directors meeting 
sunday night conducted by telephone conference call at which the 
board approved the telecom deal

to justify seizing lincoln savings and loan 
association regulators arbitrarily wrote down the value of its 
14 billion loan portfolio by 50 percent and slashed the worth of 
its extensive land hotel and stock holdings by 75 percent the 
thrifts former owner said wednesday 
without any analysis they took the entire loan portfolio and 
said it was nonperforming phoenix financier charles h keating 
jr testified in his fifth day on the witness stand in his suit 
seeking to recover the irvine calif sampl 
reading from a federal home loan bank board analysis of 
lincolns loan and equity portfolios prepared a week after the 
government imposed a conservatorship april 14 1989 keating called 
the numbers absurd 
the analysis in the form of an april 21 1989 memo from 
regulators in charge of the lincoln case to bank board officials in 
washington is the first government document specifying regulators 
estimate that alleged losses of federally insured deposits by the 
thrift could cost taxpayers 2 billion 
the document estimated that the thrifts assets were worth only 
2 billion to 25 billion or 185 billion to 22 billion less 
than what they were listed as on lincolns books at the time 
for nearly a year keating has asserted that he ran lincoln 
soundly and that regulators could show that the thrift was 
insolvent only by placing a lower value on its assets 
comparing the figures from the regulators analysis with those 
provided by american continentals chief financial officer he 
testified wednesday that only 3 percent of lincolns 14 billion 
mortage loan portfolio was more than 60 days in default 
all of the loans keating testifed were fully secured with the 
borrowers putting up an average 20 percent down payment on the 
property 
the regulators however listed the value of those loans at only 
703 million accounting for a third of the losses they claim that 
lincoln suffered 
robert wurzelbacher keatings soninlaw who headed lincolns 
real estate investments likened the analysis to a family buying a 
100000 home with a 20000 down payment and an 80000 loan 
then a regulator comes in and says the value of the home and the 
loan on it is worth only 40000 even though the monthly payments 
are still being made he said 
james murphy an attorney representing the treasury departments 
office of thrift supervision repeatedly objected to keating 
comparing the numbers from the regulators april 21 analysis and 
keatings own figures on the status of lincolns loans and equity 
holdings as of dec 31 1988 
this is not by any stretch of the imagination the last word on 
the implementation of the receivership four months later murphy 
said 
the office of thrift supervision succeeded the federal home loan 
bank board as the industrys chief regulator under the 50 billion 
savings and loan bailout passed last year by congress 
the government seized control of lincoln in april last year 
under the conservatorship claiming that it was being grossly 
mismanaged but making no assertion at the time that it was 
insolvent 
it wasnt until august that the regulators asserted that 
lincolns alleged losses actually exceeded the value of its assets 
and imposed a receivership that took ownership of the thrift from 
keating 
us district court judge stanley sporkin overruled murphys 
objections but said he wanted testimony from keatings chief 
financial officer in addition to hearing from regulators on their 
justifications for the writedowns 
you dont write down 50 percent on a mortgage portfolio 
said sporkin who is a former accountant and was at one time the 
chief enforcement officer for the securities and exchange 
commission 
keatings attorneys also introduced documents showing that 
regulators were unhappy with the performance of the consultant they 
hired at an annual salary of 300000 to run lincoln after seizing 
control from keating 
in a july 19 1989 memo to the bank boards top officials in 
washington mark randall the government official in charge of 
managing the conservatorship said the consultant roger clark 
failed to address lincolns major problems 
roger clarks inaction questionable judgment and lack of 
participation establish his inability to function as a ceo chief 
executive officer of lincoln randalls memo read 
keating said that clark is still holds titles as both the ceo 
and chief financial officer of lincoln under a contract that 
requires the government to pay him a 100000 termination fee but 
that other officials are actually running the thrift under the 
receivership

alcoholic beverage last year with americans consuming nearly 34 
gallons per capita an industry publication reported wednesday

lobbyists as major factors in the general decline of beverage 
alcohol 
the industry also is expected to be affected by added state and 
federal taxes come on many states reportedly are considering added 
alcohol taxes 
in california voters in november will decide whether to raise 
the tax on wine from one cent a gallon to 129 a gallon on beer 
from 4 cents a gallon to 573 cents a gallon and on distilled

time warner inc and viacom inc are discussing 
merging their fledgling comedy cable networks the comedy channel 
and ha sources at both companies said wednesday 
the companies had previously discussed but failed to agree on 
merging their comedy networks according to one of the sources who 
spoke on condition they not be identified 
the wall street journal reported wednesday that executives and 
attorneys from both companies said time warner and viacom are 
discussing a 5050 joint venture in a single comedy channel or a 
venture that would include equity investments by a group of cable 
operators 
a spokesman for time warner said the company had no comment on 
the report a spokeswoman for viacom read a statement from viacom 
chairman sumner redstone which said under all the circumstances 
that exist in this situation we prefer not to comment in the 
media 
both companies are believed to be facing trouble lining up cable 
tv systems that will give them a space on the channel selector 
many cable systems have already filled their available channel 
space and are reluctant to drop current networks in favor of new 
ones 
time warner launched the comedy channel last november and says 
that it has 6 million subscribers viacom started its ha cable 
network on april 1 
industry analysts say it generally takes 25 million to 30 
million subscribers for a cable network to break even 
the two networks follow different programming formats with the 
comedy channel relying on original programs and snippets from 
comedy series and movies while ha features reruns of sitcoms and 
programs such as saturday night live 
time warner and viacom are embroiled in a lawsuit in which 
viacoms showtime networks is asking for 25 billion in damages 
against time warners home box office showtime contends that hbo 
monopolizes the paytelevision business in violation of antitrust 
laws

ames department stores inc the 
troubled retailer that announced plans earlier this week to close 
74 stores said wednesday it was cutting 200 jobs in its corporate 
headquarters 
the company said in a brief announcement that 50 employees will 
be laid off and another 150 vacant jobs will not be filled the 
cuts will leave 1650 workers at the companys hartfordarea 
headquarters 
in january the company eliminated 325 jobs at its headquarters 
85 through layoffs and 240 by not filling vacancies 
the retailer has stumbled repeatedly since its 1988 purchase of 
nearly 400 zayre stores with the purchase ames doubled in size 
and instantly transformed itself from a littleknown new 
englandbased chain into the nations fourthlargest discounter 
only k mart corp walmart stores inc and the target division of 
dayton hudson corp are bigger 
the company which operates 690 stores announced monday that it 
would report a loss of 228 million for the year ended jan 27 
ames also said monday it was negotiating with its banks for a new 
credit agreement 
ames stock stabilized wednesday after dropping steadily 
beginning last thursday when the retailer announced that its sales 
in march were down 12 percent 
the stock which was trading at 9 a share on the new york stock 
exchange in early january closed at 437 last thursday and 
dropped even further to 237 after a day of heavy trading 
tuesday 
in more heavy trading wednesday ames stock closed at 250 up 
12 cents 
in late 1987 ames shares were worth nearly 30 each 
ames has attributed its troubles to the sluggish retail market 
in the northeast and to problems with the former zayre stores the 
company has been unable to revitalize the stores by renaming them 
and has even lost some zayre customers by changing that chains 
advertising and pricing policies 
the zayre stores had been known for frequent promotions heavy 
advertising and discounted fashion items ames in contrast stocks 
more traditional merchandise and runs fewer promotions 
ames management is learning that it is very difficult to wean 
the customer from a promotional vendor said l wayne hood a 
retailing analyst at prudentialbache securities inc 
further the companys attempts to quickly merge ames and zayre 
computer systems resulted in some glitches that delayed payments to 
suppliers which led some suppliers to cut off the chains credit 
ames bought the 392store zayre chain on oct 28 1988 for 800 
million doubling its size it has since closed some of those 
stores and converted others to the ames name 
the 74 stores to be closed are primarily former zayre stores in 
florida illinois indiana and ohio said douglas w ewing ames 
director of investor relations 
ames announced in december 1989 that it was closing 18 stores 
mostly in the northeast

a strong easter holiday weekend could boost 
greyhound lines inc to the financial breakeven point as it 
attempts to rebuild from a lengthy bus drivers strike says 
president frank schmieder 
the fiveday easter travel period ending monday is one of the 
five busiest times of the year for greyhound 
schmieder said in an interview this week that the company 
projects revenue in the next few days will be between 70 percent 
and 73 percent of revenue at the same time last year 
seventythree percent of revenue is cash break even and when 
we do that we figure weve turned the corner said schmieder 
jeffrey nelson a spokesman for the amalgamated council of 
greyhound local unions called greyhounds latest claims 
preposterous 
theyve been claiming the turned corners for the last six 
weeks said nelson 
the companys 6300 drivers and about 3000 of its office and 
maintenance workers walked out march 2 in an argument over wages 
and job security greyhound has been operating a reduced schedule 
since using permanent replacements and drivers willing to cross 
picket lines 
negotiations have been stalled since last month the company has 
refused to bargain until seven days have passed without major 
violence against its buses which have been hit by gunfire and 
suffered other attacks 
the company also filed a 30 million federal lawsuit earlier 
this week charging the union was behind the violence the union 
claims the company is using the violence as an excuse to avoid 
negotiations 
greyhound has increased service in stages with the latest 
addition scheduled for thursday when the company plans to add 
almost 100000 miles putting it at 458595 miles or 718 percent 
of prestrike levels 
schmieder said on march 28 that the strike was essentially 
over in much of the country as the company continued expanding 
to cover more of its prestrike routes 
union officials claim greyhound actually is operating only about 
20 percent of its prestrike routes 
through easter greyhound is offering free tickets if its buses 
are late in the busy northeast where strike service has been 
hardest hit 
schmieder said the promotion has been effective with about 800 
passengers or 14 percent of the total getting free tickets in 
the first five days of the offer business in the region has risen 
to about 12000 passengers a day from around 8000 
passenger volumes nationwide totaled more than more than 56 
percent of the volume for the same day last year according to 
company figures 
p anthony lannie greyhounds executive vice president said 
the company should be serving 95 percent of its routes by summer 
although cutbacks are possible when the slower fall season arrives 
lannie said greyhound will have 3200 drivers by may 1 but will 
need at least 1000 more to meet summer demand 
while passenger traffic may be growing the company is missing 
out on money from its small package express business which 
accounted for about 92 million of greyhounds 104 billion in 
revenue last year 
schmieder said the package business is at about 45 percent of 
yearearlier levels although he expects the increased service to 
raise that to 50 percent 
greyhounds charter operation which last year brought in 90 
million has been almost nonexistent during the strike as the 
company has used drivers for its mainline operations 
greyhound lines was created three years ago in a debtfinanced 
buyout of the bus operations of greyhound corp later that year 
greyhound lines also bought the dallasbased operator of the 
largest trailways bus system 
despite its reduced cash flow greyhound has continued to pay 
its bills schmieder says the next interest payment is due may 15 
and if we had to make the payment today we could do it

concerning the harrier 
northrop also has been accused of making political payoffs to
