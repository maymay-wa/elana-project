public order minister tassos sehiotis 
resigned monday after a greekamerican banker indicted in a 30 
million financial scandal fled the country apparently aboard a 
yacht 
the conservative opposition immediately demanded the resignation 
of premier andreas papandreous socialist government claiming it 
was staging a coverup 
banker george koskotas 34 disappeared saturday afternoon a 
police officer speaking on condition of anonymity said koskotas 
fled abroad on sunday apparently by yacht from the seaside village 
of megalo pefko 20 miles from athens 
sehiotis said a warrant had been issued for koskotas arrest one 
week ago koskotas was banned from leaving greece pending the 
outcome of an official enquiry into alleged financial irregularities 
at the bank of crete which he controls 
sehiotis whose ministry was responsible for police surveillance 
of koskotas said he was resigning since such public order 
ministry omissions create an issue of political sensitivity 
the scandal has shaken the government because of accusations in 
greek newspapers that senior socialist officials were involved in 
illegal deals set up by the bank of crete 
the socialists also have been criticized for permitting koskotas 
to build a multimillion dollar banking and media empire in greece 
since 1984 without adequate checks by the central bank on his 
financial background 
the government last week pledged absolute clarity in 
uncovering the scandal and warned there will be no pardons for 
members of the ruling panhellenic socialist movement pasok who may 
be implicated 
the greek people are left with the conviction that george 
koskotas was spirited away so that he would not speak the 
responsibility goes all the way to the top of the government 
pyramid constantine mitsotakis leader of the new democracy main 
opposition party party said in a statement demanding the government 
resign 
koskotas was suspended oct 20 as chairman of the bank of crete 
and indicted on five counts of forgery and embezzlement 
last week koskotas appeared before a district attorney on a 
charge of forging documents purporting to show that the bank of 
crete had 13 million invested with the american brokerage firm 
merrill lynch 
he was not detained but given until nov 14 to prepare his 
defense 
koskotas also is accused of forging documents purporting to show 
his bank had another 17 million in an account with an american 
bank irving trust corp both us firms have said they had no 
record of the deposits 
koskotas who holds both american and greek citizenship bought a 
controlling interest in the bank of crete in 1984 after working in 
its central athens branch for six years as an accountant 
rival newspapers have claimed koskotas illegally used bank of 
crete money to fund his publishing group grammi which controls 
three daily newspapers five magazines and a radio station 
koskotas resigned oct 29 as chairman of grammi the day after 
the premiers son education minister george papandreou denounced 
as a forgery a bank of crete statement showing a 23 million 
transfer to a merrill lynch account in his name 
the younger papandreou showed reporters a letter from a new york 
lawyer saying there was no record at merrill lynch of such a 
transfer 
koskotas parents brother wife and five children all have left 
greece during the past week

police arrested 377 people including prominent 
pediatrician and social activist benjamin spock on monday in the 
culmination of a long series of protests on capitol hill called to 
focus attention on the plight of the homeless in america 
were here to show the politicians that there is a crisis in 
america a crisis that they are not responding to a crisis that we 
want answers for said mitch snyder a washington advocate for the 
homeless and organizer of the protests 
snyder led a march and 90minute rally across constitution avenue 
from the capitol building capping the event with his exhortation to 
the crowd to sit down in the middle of the street and be arrested as 
way of showing concern for the homeless 
some 377 followed snyders appeal and were arrested by police on 
charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing traffic on capitol 
grounds said dan nichols a spokesman for the capitol police 
the protest and arrests had been coordinated with capitol police 
and were generally quiet about 2000 persons attended the rally 
nichols said 
one of the speakers was the academy awardwinning actress cher 
who had originally taken part in the march to the capitol from a 
motel five miles away she left the march to promote her new line of 
perfume uninhibited but returned to the rally in a black van 
limousine she left shortly before the arrests began 
im sorry im late but i had to go do my job she explained 
im here to show my concern and my support for the homeless im 
very committed to the cause of the homeless people have to have it 
brought into their consciousness that the plight of the homeless is 
very serious 
snyder of the community for creative nonviolence organized a 
series of protests beginning sept 26 to call attention to the 
plight of the homeless carol fennelly a member of the organization 
who also joined in the fast has been bedridden and did not 
participate in mondays protest 
a total of 239 people have been arrested by capitol police during 
the protest nichols said most were charged with unlawful entry 
the rally took on the trappings of a political gathering with 
dozens of people in the crowd sporting dukakisbentsen buttons 
and signs in support of the democratic presidential ticket no signs 
in support of vice president george bush the republican 
presidential nominee were apparent 
weve already seen what bush can do during the eight years of 
the reagan administration said snyder whoever wins the 
election it will be a long fight to improve the situation for the 
homeless but i think it will be easier if dukakis wins

lawmakers angered by president reagans veto of 
a bill to limit advertising in childrens tv programs say congress 
will be back next year with another possibly tougher measure 
reagan killed the bill late saturday night with a pocket veto 
even though the measure had overwhelming support in congress 
critics likened his action to ideological child abuse and called 
his administration morally bankrupt 
reagan said the bill to impose ad limits and make childrens 
informational programming a condition of station license renewals 
would violate constitutional guarantees of free speech and might 
discourage commercial networks from financing quality childrens 
programming 
but rep edward j markey dmass coauthor of the bill said 
the veto was another example of the administration putting 
commercial considerations and ideological precepts ahead of 
childrens interests 
the presidents actions represent a victory for the toy and 
cereal hucksters but a major defeat for our nations children 
said markey chairman of the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications subcommittee 
rep matthew j rinaldo of new jersey ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said reagan acted on bad advice in killing the measure 
it was a rather conservative piece of legislation with a 
minimal amount of regulation far less onerous than earlier 
proposals that were considered but set aside in favor of the 
bipartisan compromise he said 
next year whoever is president will be faced with a tougher 
bill and a more determined congress rinaldo predicted 
the measure would have limited advertising in childrens shows to 
10 minutes per hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays 
the federal communications commission had imposed similar limits 
on broadcasters but scrapped them four years ago in the belief that 
selfregulation by the industry would determine what was best for 
children 
the bill also would have required tv broadcasters to provide 
educational and informational programming for children as a 
condition of license renewal 
the senate approved the measure on a voice vote last month the 
house passed it by a margin of 32878 in june 
reagan said that while he supports efforts to improve the quality 
of childrens programs this bill simply cannot be reconciled with 
the freedom of expression secured by our constitution 
he said the constitution simply does not empower the federal 
government to oversee the programming decisions of broadcasters in 
the manner prescribed by this bill 
childrens television advocates had pushed for the bill because 
they said that under the fccs philosophy of deregulation 
childrens tv has become overcommercialized and the quality of 
programs has suffered 
peggy charren president of the cambridge massbased action for 
childrens television which has worked 20 years for passage of the 
measure said she was flabbergasted by the veto 
here was a bill that was not going to raise the deficit not 
going to raise taxes was going to get a little bit of education for 
children and what reagan said was you dont have to do anything 
for children i call it ideological child abuse she said 
the measure was a bipartisan compromise that had been stripped of 
proposals to outlaw shows called programlength commercials by 
critics that feature toy manufacturers products and to require 
broadcasters to air an hour of educational programming per day 
the final measure had the tacit support of the broadcasting 
industry after the national association of broadcasters lobbied 
effectively against the stronger versions of the bill 
edward o fritts president of the nab said that while we 
recognize this legislation charted some new territory we were 
willing to accept its outcome 
the veto puts back on track an fcc inquiry into the 
commercialization of childrens tv the commission is considering 
whether it is necessary to impose advertising limits and regulate 
programlength commercials and interactive toys that respond to 
inaudible signals beamed through tv sets 
but lawmakers and childrens tv advocates say they do not expect 
the current fcc to depart from the reagan administrations 
philosophy of deregulation

on a recent trip back to texas education 
secretary lauro cavazos insisted on shaking hands with every student 
who goes to school on the huge ranch where he was born 
as they filed past the first hispanic member of a presidents 
cabinet the son of a ranch hand told each child how he too had once 
studied in the tiny schoolhouse nestled among the prickly brush and 
mesquite trees on the king ranch 
you can do it if you just stay in school cavazos told them 
when we talk to young people about opportunity through 
education it helps to have a man at the top who proves through his 
own life and experience that the american system of opportunity 
through education works says sen phil gramm rtexas 
cavazos was born on the king ranch which is the largest in the 
united states and covers 914000 acres in south texas the ranch 
which includes parts of six counties between harlingen and corpus 
christi is the bedrock of one of the nations biggest oil and gas 
fortunes and is credited with the development of the santa gertrudis 
cattle breed the first native to this country darwin smith 
chairman and chief executive of kimberlyclark corp is chairman of 
the privately held ranch 
cavazos who began his schooling along with other cowboys 
spanishspeaking children at the ranch became education secretary 
on sept 20 
his nomination by president reagan to replace william j bennett 
from a list of latino candidates was criticized by hispanic leaders 
as a political ploy to bolster republican presidential nominee 
george bush in the hispanic community 
rep albert bustamante a san antonio democrat and chairman of 
the congressional hispanic caucus said at the time it seems that 
the administration has just discovered that hispanics exist 
but he praised cavazos the president of texas tech university 
and its medical school since 1980 as well respected well 
prepared with a history in education that is second to none 
cavazos will serve until jan 20 unless reappointed by the next 
president and brushes aside questions about the next turn in his 
career saying he reached his lifes goal when he became a full 
professor 
he is firm in insisting no deal has been struck for him to remain 
in the cabinet if bush wins on tuesday but speculation is strong 
that cavazos would be asked to stay 
cavazos has campaigned for the republican ticket in trips that 
include visits to local schools and emphasizes the need to keep 
students from dropping out and to educate the illiterate 
handicapped and dyslexic to their fullest potential 
in texas he says 45 percent of hispanics dont finish high 
school while the rate for blacks is 32 percent the national 
average is 285 percent 
while economic troubles early marriage drugs or alcohol are 
blamed for the hispanic dropout rate cavazos sees those as merely 
symptoms of an unraveling family structure unable to give children 
the support and confidence they need 
if the family structure is tight and intact and if it values 
education if it really wants to see these young people move ahead 
i think therein is the fundamental problem if that family 
structure is not a good tight structure that supports education and 
encourages education and raises the vision of young people and says 
yes son yes daughter you will educate yourself they can 
fall into the social ills i talked about 
cavazos credits his parents a cattle foreman and a homemaker 
who never went to college with encouraging their five children to 
get degrees one son dick became a fourstar army general and 
another bob was an allamerica running back who now owns a ranch 
a father of 10 cavazos voice fills with emotion when he recalls 
graduating from texas tech with his bachelors degree 
i was so proud so proud when i looked at my father when i got 
my baccalaureate degree he says and his pride in me when i 
went up the academic ladder there was so clear

the coast guards voluntary safety programs 
have failed to reduce the number of accidents and deaths in the 
nations most dangerous industry commercial fishing says the 
national transportation safety board 
the two agencies are about to lock horns again over the issue 
with the ntsb pressing for mandatory licensing of captains and 
mandatory safety training for crews 
coast guard officials insist their voluntary programs already 
have reduced the number of fishing boat accidents and fatalities a 
contention disputed by the ntsb 
despite the coast guard statement that fishing vessel casualty 
rates for 1986 and 1987 have decreased safety board accident 
investigations indicate that major marine fishing vessel and 
property loss rates have not decreased from january 1978 until july 
1988 and the death rate has increased in recent months the ntsb 
said in a recent report 
the report focused on the sinking of the seattlebased fishing 
vessel uyak ii in the bering sea almost a year ago two crew 
members including the captain were rescued but the bodies of four 
others were never recovered 
the ntsb said the 115foot vessel began to list but it was not 
equipped with a general alarm system that could have alerted the 
crew to the problem 
in the report and in a midoctober letter to coast guard 
commandant paul yost jr the safety board once again urged the 
coast guard to seek congressional approval for a series of mandatory 
regulations including captain licensing vessel inspection and crew 
safety training 
we laid out what we think needs to be done but our 
recommendations have no force of law said ted lopatkiewicz an 
ntsb spokesman 
the ntsb says the fishing industry has the poorest safety record 
of any industry in the nation and the death rate for fishermen is 
seven times the national average for all industry groups 
from january 1978 to april 1987 the safety board investigated 
207 major fishing accidents which involved the loss of 147 lives and 
a total property loss of more than 165 million 
that breaks down to 18 accidents 14 million worth of property 
loss and 13 deaths per month 
this year congress did approve legislation requiring commercial 
fishing vessels to carry such basic safety equipment as life rafts 
survival suits and emergency transmitters 
the coast guard has 90 days to respond to the latest ntsb 
recommendations most of which it has rejected outright over the 
past three years 
for instance since early 1986 the coast guard has at least three 
times rejected the recommendation that it seek authority from 
congress to license fishing vessel captains 
before taking the more radical step of requiring these masters 
to be licensed the voluntary program should be given a chance to 
demonstrate how effective it can be the coast guard said in a 
letter to the ntsb in march 
the coast guard said casualty rates declined in 1986 and 1987 and 
in our view part of this improvement may be attributed to the 
voluntary program 
the coast guard also said mandatory licensing would require 225 
new employees cost 9 million to set up and 800000 a year to run 
lopatkiewicz said agencies often are reluctant to adopt ntsb 
recommendations and that it takes time to win them over 
we hope eventually they see the light he said adding that 
because it has only the power of recommendation the ntsb sometimes 
has to regulate by raised eyebrow

the days of champagne and plastic roses are 
coming to an end in jordan a country running short of imported 
money to pay for imported goods 
the government saturday imposed taxes and restrictions on imports 
aimed at saving 200 million a year in foreign currency for this 
country of 28 million people 
we started developing a champagne budget on a beer pocketbook 
this is why the economy has to be adjusted said a senior 
government official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the belttightening move appeared to be the first step in what 
the official said would be a three to fiveyear period during which 
jordan hopes to slash its 6 to 7 billion foreign debt 
the government banned new letters of credit to finance cars and 
trucks video recorders refrigerators microwave ovens television 
sets chandeliers marble plastic flowers and fruit and a dozen 
other goods 
finance minister hanna odeh announced on television sunday night 
that banning chandeliers alone will save 3 million 
goods already financed were slapped with stiff import duties 
sending the price of some tv sets up 40 percent to help cushion the 
blow the government cut electricity and water bills 
the blacklist targets the posh western lifestyle many jordanians 
adopted in the early 1980s when their country was flush with money 
much of it imported by hundreds of thousands of palestinians with 
jordanian passports who worked in the persian gulf 
it will touch the conspicuous consumer class which 
unfortunately we have developed said kamel abu jaber a political 
scientist at the university of jordan he noted that the large 
masses of people would not be affected by the restrictions 
some officials have said privately that the economy has been hurt 
by king husseins decision in july to renounce sovereignty over 
palestinians in the israelioccupied west bank which jordan 
governed from 1948 to 1967 
plans to remove their citizenship and give them twoyear instead 
of fiveyear passports led some palestinians to withdraw savings 
from jordanian banks because of the uncertainty of their status in 
jordan one official said 
one western diplomat who requested anonymity estimated that 
nearly 30 percent of jordans currency is held by palestinians in 
the west bank and the israelioccupied gaza strip 
the new restrictions also follow a slide in the value of jordans 
once stable currency the dinar which was worth about 3 last 
year drifted to about 266 last month and is now hovering around 
2 
bankers said the effective devaluation would help curb imports by 
raising their prices 
more than half of the residents of jordan are in a sense imports 
themselves families from palestine which is now israel who fled 
as refugees from their homeland in 1948 and 1967 and were granted 
citizenship 
many went to work in the gulf during the oil boom of the late 
1970s they sent a total of more than 1 billion back to families in 
jordan or through jordanian banks to relatives in the west bank 
the other mainstay of jordans economy arab aid has also been 
slipping about 360 million a year have come from saudi arabia 
since 1979 but other arab states have fallen short of the total 
125 billion a year in aid they pledged to jordan as a state on the 
front line with israel 
since 1982 the slumping oil market also has been responsible for 
the reduction in foreign capital 
but most jordanian bankers and analysts seemed optimistic about 
the longterm prospects for a country rich in educated manpower 
weve been living beyond our means and i believe that right now 
we have to adjust said jawad anani an economist who heads the 
royal scientific society in amman 
with the new policies discouraging imports and encouraging 
greater production theres a very good chance for jordanians to 
pull out of this he said

astrophysicist fang lizhi is happiest pondering 
the mysteries of the universe but he has become embroiled in the 
more worldly affairs of politics by fearlessly speaking out against 
chinas communist government 
fang 52 has emerged as chinas top dissident by publicly 
championing democracy and questioning marxism in this oneparty 
state 
we hope we have a good government but there is no guarantee 
says the beijing observatory professor with the easy manner and 
impish smile the only guarantee comes from peoples pressure 
i like to speak freely he said in a recent interview in his 
airy beijing apartment i think i just show we have the right 
of speech 
fang emerged during prodemocracy student demonstrations that 
rocked major chinese cities in late 1986 and early 1987 authorities 
said speeches he gave to students at the university of science and 
technology in hefei helped incite the protests 
when chinas leaders cracked down on the protests fang was 
kicked out of the communist party and fired from his university post 
the demonstrations died down but fang refused to be silenced 
since his purge he has given a series of interviews to foreign 
journalists criticizing oneparty rule and claiming marxism is 
outdated and widely unpopular no other chinese of his stature has 
dared to publicly launch such attacks on the system 
during a summer visit to australia fang mentioned rumors that 
many chinese leaders and their children maintained foreign bank 
accounts chinese authorities reportedly displeased with his 
statements subsequently withdrew permission for fang to travel to 
the united states later this year 
fang said he does not regret any of his comments and will 
continue to speak out im a soldier who already crossed the 
river he said theres no way to turn back 
authorities are reluctant to allow fang to speak before an 
audience even on nonpolitical topics he said 
at an informal gathering on the beijing university campus to mark 
the schools 90th anniversary in may he was treated like a hero by 
several hundred students who came to hear him speak on science and 
democracy when fang was leaving a crowd formed around him and 
students thrust forward books envelopes handkerchiefs and even 
money for the professor to sign 
letters of support come to fang almost daily from around the 
country he says they encourage him to continue his activities 
the last person to embody support for democracy in china was wei 
jingsheng a former electrician at the beijing zoo he was sentenced 
to 15 years in jail in 1979 on charges of supplying military secrets 
to a foreign power and agitating to topple the chinese communist 
system 
the government however generally has attempted to show leniency 
toward fang in an effort to improve the countrys image 
when reporters last year suggested his apartment on the beijing 
university campus was too small authorities immediately gave him 
new quarters about twice the size 
they want to use me i know that fang said on one side 
they dont like me they criticize me on the other side they 
want to show they are open 
the official beijing review in may published a lengthy feature on 
fang and other official media ran articles about his scientific 
work but the hong kongbased newspaper south china morning post 
says chinese publications recently were instructed not to mention 
the professors name 
fang was born to the family of a postal clerk in the southern 
coastal city of hangzhou and was admitted to beijing university in 
1952 at age 16 to study physics and nuclear reactor theory 
he became one of chinas pioneer researchers in laser theory and 
won international attention with his research in cosmology the 
study of the universe 
fang said his break with marxism began over cosmology 
according to the professor former politburo member hu qiaomu had 
questioned the need to study cosmology since marxism already 
maintained the universe was infinite 
this is an open question right now fang said in 
cosmology marxism is not right 
fang lives with his wife li shuxian a professor of physics at 
beijing university and the younger of their two sons in an 
apartment about 780 square feet in size huge by beijing standards 
a poster of albert einstein hangs near the entrance and the 
apartment has a new personal computer and a video cassette recorder 
both rare items in china 
fang who earns 73 a month receives 2688 a year for research 
he devotes much of his energy to writing scientific papers and the 
14 published this year include physics and beauty and why 
doesnt the universe go into heat death

the american medical school in 
grenada has fallen on hard times in the five years since invading 
us troops evacuated its students and flung the onceobscure school 
into the news 
st georges university school of medicine whose students 
president reagan said were saved from becoming hostages of a marxist 
government is still turning out doctors on this lush tropical 
island at the southern tip of the caribbean 
the 11yearold private school now boasts 1390 graduates 
licensed in 45 us states and clinical training programs at 
hospitals in new jersey new york and britain 
but as one of several socalled offshore schools in the region 
catering to to students rejected by us medical schools st 
georges is straining from a steep decline in the overall number of 
young people going into medicine 
since the invasion of october 1983 enrollment at the schools 
two grenada campuses has plunged from 480 to 226 it has cut its 
work force from 120 to 90 and put expansion plans on hold tuition 
has nearly doubled to 17000 a year from 8700 in 1983 
a few years ago st georges accepted only one of every 10 
applicants now its taking one of every two 
the caliber of our students has declined ill be candid about 
it chancellor charles r modica said in an interview but the 
american medical schools pool of applicants has gone down 
despite the fall in enrollment st georges still has 33 
fulltime professors down just two from 1983 and 44 parttime 
visiting professors down four officials say the school is in no 
danger of closing 
theres no thinking in that respect said spokesman arthur 
massolo its alive and kicking and we intend to keep it that 
way 
the us medical establishment has long denounced st georges 
and other offshore medical schools as diploma mills but 
teachers and adminstrators say st georges students are highly 
motivated and score well on qualifying exams 
my kids get as good training in gross anatomy as they can get 
anywhere in the world said dr john b christensen chairman of 
the department of anatomy who held the same post for seven years at 
the university of missouri at kansas city 
we could sell diplomas he said but a diploma does not 
permit you to practice medicine you still have to take 
boardqualifying exams 
modica a new york lawyer founded st georges at the age of 29 
after being rejected by four us medical schools and spending a 
fruitless year in spain trying to become a doctor 
the school grew steadily but attracted little attention until the 
united states decided to overthrow a radical procuban junta that 
seized power and murdered leftwing prime minister maurice bishop 
in justifying the invasion reagan said the students at st 
georges most of whom were americans were in danger of being taken 
hostage 
they were evacuated in army helicopters by some of the 6000 us 
marines and paratroopers who landed on the island oct 25 1983 
along with a token caribbean force 
a stately bronze monument bearing the engraved signatures of the 
19 us servicemen killed in action reminds visitors st georges 
main campus on grand anse beach was once a war zone 
initially school officials strongly opposed the invasion saying 
grenadas rulers assured them the students would not be harmed but 
within days they changed their minds 
modica says today that he was briefed at the state department and 
shown documents of discussions within the revolutionary government 
that persuaded him the students might have been taken hostage 
after the briefing i felt that there was some justification 
for military action he said it was a close call and i 
wouldnt have wanted to make the decision 
modica said enrollment peaked around the time of the invasion and 
has been falling for the past 2 years 
the reason he said is the medical profession with its long 
hard years of training and costly malpractice suits has become much 
less attractive to american graduates over the past decade 
applications to us medical schools have dropped from 42624 in 
1974 to 28123 last year with the biggest decline occurring over 
the past four years according to the asssociation of american 
medical colleges 
as a result the nations 127 accredited medical schools are 
opening their doors to students who just a few years ago would not 
have qualified officials say and that has shrunk the pool of 
applicants for schools like st georges

knox white wants the good people of south 
carolinas 4th congressional district to think of him every time 
they hear george bushs name a strategy many republican hopefuls 
are pursuing this year 
white 34 a city councilman from greenville sc is trying to 
oust freshman democratic rep liz patterson in a district that the 
gop presidential nominee is expected to sweep 
so whites speeches and advertisements are studded with 
references to the vice president and like bush he repeatedly 
pledges to oppose tax increases protect jobs and battle illegal 
drugs 
every republican south of washington dc is linking himself 
to george bush says whites campaign manager bob knight 
maybe so but on the eve of what national polls indicate is 
likely to be a bush victory over democrat michael dukakis few 
people expect either candidate to provide much of a boost to more 
than a few house hopefuls 
politicians and observers unanimously expect the house to remain 
solidly democratic whatever the presidential races outcome and 
they agree that if bush wins and if he pulls gop house contenders to 
victory at all it is likely to be in only a handful of races 
scattered across the country mainly in the conservative south 
as george bush does better it helps the image of the 
republican party says north carolina gop chairman jack hawke in 
whose state there are four tight house races but in the past we 
just havent seen coattails that significantly in north carolina 
for the coattail effect to work a presidential candidate must be 
so appealing that he draws large numbers of people to the polls who 
dutifully vote for other candidates of the same party 
but in recent decades strict partyline voting has been going 
the way of candidates who lack blowdried coiffures 
beginning with president eisenhowers reelection in 1956 more 
than one quarter of the countrys 435 house districts have voted for 
one party for president and the other party for its representative 
in 1984 such ticket splitting between the presidential and house 
candidates occurred in 196 districts or 45 percent 
most house races are pretty insulated from the presidential 
election says spokeswoman peggy connolly of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee 
the reasons are many increasing numbers of voters identify 
themselves as independents and often decide congressional races on 
local issues not national ones and incumbents of both parties 
usually enjoy insurmountable fundraising advantages and represent 
districts drawn to maximize their reelection prospects 
not only do most house incumbents seeking reelection win these 
days the success rate was 98 percent in 1986 but they are doing 
it so convincingly that they are usually invulnerable to defeat by 
their partys presidential candidate 
two years ago nearly nine out of every 10 incumbents were 
reelected with at least 60 percent of the major party vote putting 
them far out of range of the 1 or 2 percent vote swing that a strong 
presidential candidate can bring to house contenders on his ticket 
for there to be coattails this year it would have to be in a 
race thats very close and in an area where bush will do very 
well says martin wattenberg a political science professor at the 
university of california at irvine who studies voting behavior 
were talking about a pretty minimal impact there 
political pros on both sides say about a dozen such races do 
exist besides the contest between white and patterson who 
mentions dukakis name as infrequently as possible others where 
presidential coattails might help are republican lyons grays bid to 
oust democratic rep stephen neal in north carolinas 5th district 
gop rep john hilers fight to hold off democratic challenger tom 
ward in the indiana 3rd and democrat harry johnstons fight with 
republican ken adams to retain an open democratic seat in the 
florida 14th 
but even though republicans might pick up a few seats this year 
that may be attributed to bushs victory it is possible that for 
the first time since 1960 the party that wins the presidential race 
might suffer a net loss of seats in the house 
that is largely because while the 70 contests considered 
reasonably close are split evenly between democratic and republican 
seats the gop holds 15 of the 27 open seats that are not being 
defended by an incumbent open seats are where turnover from one 
party to the other is most likely 
it is even possible that in a losing effort dukakis might still 
help democrats in tight house races in new england including 
democratic rep fernand st germains effort to retain his 1st 
district rhode island seat against republican ronald machtley and 
democrat james donchesss fight for the open gop seat in new 
hampshires 2nd district against republican chuck douglas 
since the democrats lost 20 house seats when president kennedy 
was elected in 1960 the party of the winning presidential candidate 
has picked up seats in the chamber every four years 
since then the presidential year swings have ranged from the 38 
seats the democrats won in president johnsons 1964 victory to the 
two democratic pickups that accompanied president carters 1976 
triumph

changing the veterans administration into the 
department of veterans affairs may be relatively cheap as government 
programs go but officials say it will still cost upwards of 9 
million over the next decade 
much of that money will go for new signs and stationery for the 
governments fifthlargest agency according to officials from the 
va and the congressional budget office 
but given the relative size the cost impact isnt expected to 
be significant particularly in any one given year said nina 
shepard the cbo analyst who helped develop the cost projections 
when the new department comes into being next march 15 it will 
be little different from the current va according to bonner day a 
spokesman for the agency 
i dont think much has to be done before march 15 the 
essential duties have not been changed the biggest difference is 
that the head of the agency will now be a member of the cabinet 
he explained 
the agency wont move from any of its more than 500 buildings 
around the country nor will its operations be greatly affected 
really except for the different name and what that requires 
well be the same as we are now he explained i dont think you 
will see changes day to day 
what is required by the name change are new signs thousands of 
them along with stationery with the new name 
the va has a 30 billion annual budget much of which is 
disbursed in payments to the nations veterans there are about 27 
million veterans and 49 million dependents of veterans or survivors 
although only about 25 to 3 million use va services on a regular 
basis 
the bill creating the department of veterans affairs as the 14th 
seat in the cabinet was signed by president reagan on oct 25 
shortly after it had been given overwhelming approval by both the 
house and senate 
veterans organizations had long had the bill at the top of their 
legislative agenda and said moving the agency into the cabinet would 
elevate the status of veterans 
the va is estimating a cost of 98 million for the switch 
including 85 million for signs and the rest for changing 
stationary and the names on veterans publications 
the signs will have to be changed at the more than 500 va 
buildings around the country day said the va is still trying to 
figure out just exactly how many new signs it will need 
the va doesnt plan to change all its signs or buy new stationery 
right away ms shepard said we tried to find out the number of 
signs but they didnt have an exact figure at hand 
as the old stationary runs out they will buy new stuff she 
said similarly the signs will be redone over the next five years 
during the congressional debate over changing the vas status 
some legislators said the total cost might be 33 million far 
higher than the 98 million figure 
but that estimate was for a different bill which would have 
substantially expanded the staff of the agencys inspector general 
department the office which guards against wrongdoing the bulk of 
the additional money would have gone to hire new staff members ms 
shepard said those provisions were dropped

george bush and michael dukakis each promise to 
cut the federal deficit if elected president but their proposals 
for new programs could put the united states deeper in debt 
economic and political analysts say 
each candidate has described or endorsed plans covering areas 
from defense to child care that could total billions of dollars in 
increased spending if adopted by congress without offsetting cuts in 
other spending 
these guys are going in the opposite direction said 
professor james thurber director of the center for congressional 
and presidential studies at american university theyre talking 
about spending money rather than saving money 
henry j aaron senior fellow in economic studies at the 
brookings institution cited the failure of both candidates in my 
view to deal responsibly with the deficit problem 
bush and dukakis have expressed concern about the budget deficit 
which was 155 billion in fiscal 1988 which just ended the 
national debt under 1 trillion when ronald reagan took office is 
now more than 26 trillion 
concerns about the deficits potential effect on the us and 
global economies played a role in last years drop in world stock 
markets and led to an agreement between reagan and the congress to 
limit spending 
thurber said the us budget deficit remains one of the main 
concerns to foreign investors who now are loaning the money to pay 
for more than half of the debt and are concerned about the security 
of their funds 
they dont have very many other places to send their money but 
theyre wondering if theyll ever get their money out of this 
situation said thurber 
marvin kosters of the american enterprise institute said new 
programs could be adopted without increasing the budget deficit if 
other programs are cut but not painlessly and not without 
political conflict certainly 
aaron said he thinks pressures in congress will keep any new 
programs small and have them selffinanced by eliminating tax 
benefits or cutting other programs 
dukakis has said he would cut some nuclear weapons but his 
pledge to build up conventional arms could prove very costly 
said thurber 
bush has criticized dukakis for opposing both the mobile mx and 
midgetman missiles but acknowledges he cannot afford to press ahead 
with both bush says dukakis is naive to let the soviets know in 
advance what missiles he will eliminate 
bushs proposals include a 37 billion invest in our 
children package aimed at children of lowincome families that 
would help provide day care more preschool education and better 
health care 
dukakis endorsed the concept but not the exact dollar amount of 
the 25 billion a better child day care bill that failed to win 
approval in congress this year it would set federal standards and 
funnel money to states to expand daycare slots 
dukakis wants to spend 100 million on prenatal health care that 
he claims would pay for itself in a year because infants born under 
the plan would be healthier and require less hospital care after 
birth 
dukakis also wants to require all but the smallest employers to 
offer basic health insurance to workers and their families a move 
he says will cost the government nothing but which bush says 
amounts to a new tax of at least 35 billion on those businesses 
dukakis says his plan would insure 22 million of the nations 37 
million uninsured 
aaron said that over time it would reduce tax revenues because it 
would shift some income from the taxable category to the untaxable 
fringebenefit category 
bush proposes a reduction in capital gains taxes which would 
benefit people with investments in the stock market and elsewhere 
at a cost estimated by the congressional budget office at 39 
billion a year 
bush claims the tax reduction would free up money for more 
private investment creating jobs and stimulating the economy thus 
in the end it would work toward reducing the deficit because the 
government would have more people paying taxes 
bush vows he would adopt no new taxes and claims he would 
eliminate the deficit by putting a flexible freeze on government 
spending to keep total growth at the inflation rate 
dukakis says he would increase enforcement of tax collection and 
would raise taxes only as a last resort but theyre just not 
going to get that much more money out of it said thurber adding 
that the reagan administration has already increased the number of 
agents pursuing tax cheats

a barrage of preelection polls has given george 
bush a lead for popular votes in the presidential contest and an 
even greater advantage in the more critical race for electoral votes 
with election day looming a 50state poll by abc news and the 
washington post put 25 states firmly in bushs column and another 16 
leaning his way only the district of columbia was firm for democrat 
michael dukakis 
though the poll did not jibe with all other individual state 
assessments it assigned bush a daunting lead his 25 firm states 
alone would provide more than the 270 electoral votes needed for 
election 
in national popularity the abcpost poll gave bush a 10point 
lead among likely voters 5444 percent gallup found bush up by 12 
points a cbs news poll said nine points and a usa todaycnn poll 
said 11 nbc newswall street journal and harris polls found a 
closer race with a 5point bush lead 
the differing results indicated continuing indecision and 
dissatisfaction among some voters factors that can accentuate the 
effect of differences in polling dates and methods such as 
identifying likely voters 
there was room for movement one in five respondents in the 
gallup and nbcjournal polls were undecided or said they could 
change their minds and in gallups poll only about half of each 
candidates support was strong 
gallup however said its undecided respondents appeared likely 
to split evenly on the basis of their background and ideology 
voter dissatisfaction was clear twothirds in the nbcjournal 
poll said the campaign was one of the worst in recent history as 
many were unhappy with the nominees discussion of the issues and 
six in 10 said they wished other candidates were running 
as it was bush led in most ratings on presidential ability 
likely voters by 6225 percent said he would be better able to 
maintain a strong defense and he outranked dukakis on crime the 
economy and foreign policy 
the abcposts statebystate poll underlined the difficulty of 
dukakis position he needed to win all his firm and leaning states 
all the tossup states all the leaning bush states and at least one 
firm bush state 
the poll conducted by reinterviewing most of the respondents in 
a 50state survey in early october found 17 states moving toward 
bush and only three moving toward dukakis the number of states 
firmly or leaning for dukakis actually declined from eight to four 
the results did not agree with all recent state polls new york 
was rated as leaning to bush for example although a recent state 
poll put dukakis slightly ahead in new york washington state also 
was said to be leaning for bush although a poll there last week put 
dukakis ahead by 10 points 
usa today and cnn conducted five separate state polls finding 
bush ahead in california 5445 in ohio 5842 and in 
pennsylvania 5346 it was about even in illinois 5148 for bush 
and michigan 5149 for bush 
although the other new national surveys were not large enough for 
statebystate results gallup found the race tight in the east and 
bush leading strongly in all other regions particularly the south 
the closer nbcjournal poll found bush leading well in the south and 
west with tight races in the east and midwest 
in popularity nationwide the abcpost poll found a slight 
decline from a 13point bush lead late last month the other polls 
sunday also found some tightening although they disagreed on its 
extent 
the abcpost poll was weighted to an effective sample size of 
1500 likely voters for the national popularity figure with a 
margin of error of plus or minus three points margins of error 
varied statebystate and abc made characterizations of the state 
results without releasing numbers 
in addition to the district of columbia firmly for dukakis it 
said hawaii massachusetts and minnesota were leaning his way 
tossups were illinois oregon pennsylvania rhode island vermont 
and west virginia 
leaning for bush were alabama colorado iowa kansas louisiana 
new york maine maryland michigan montana mississippi nebraska 
nevada oklahoma tennessee and washington the rest were rated as 
firm for bush 
nbc and the journal polled 1721 likely voters tuesday through 
saturday gallup 1969 thursday through saturday harris 2114 
wednesday through saturday cbs 1585 friday and saturday usa 
todaycnn 2506 nationally and about 500 in each of the five states 
thursday through sunday 
the gallup and harris polls had margins of error of plus or minus 
two percentage points the nbcjournal and cbs polls three points 
the usa todaycnn polls two points for the national sample four

despite a decline in smoking annual spending 
by americans on cigarettes is climbing and probably will continue to 
do so through the rest of this century says an agriculture 
department economist 
manufacturers will face falling domestic volume and will need 
to raise prices to maintain profits verner grise said tax 
rates of state and local governments will continue to rise the need 
for additional tax revenues is mounting and tobacco taxes 
especially cigarettes have been a mainstay of state revenue systems 
for many years 
grise who specializes in tobacco analysis for the departments 
economic research service said that in addition to federal and 
state taxes a growing number of local jurisdictions are looking to 
the same revenue source 
reporting in the agencys latest agricultural outlook magazine 
grise said there have been dramatic changes in the last decade 
spending for cigarettes is double what it was 10 years ago 
he said but the rise reflects higher prices not more use us 
consumption has fallen 10 percent from its peak of 640 billion 
cigarettes in 1981 retail cigarette prices on the other hand have 
risen about 90 percent since 1980 
most of the increase has been from higher manufacturer and 
wholesale prices and from the boosts in taxes prices go up to 
maintain or enhance profits as well as to cover rising manufacturing 
costs 
last year grise said americans spent about 335 billion on 
cigarettes a little more than 1 percent of consumer disposable 
income and approximately the same proportion as 10 years ago 
cigarette excise taxes totaled about 97 billion in 1987 
compared with 66 billion in 1980 he said federal taxes accounted 
for 49 percent with state and local governments the remainder 
but looked at another way total excise taxes only accounted for 
29 percent of consumer expenditures on cigarettes in 1987 down from 
34 percent in 1980 grise said that although taxes rose the 
marketing bill for manufacturing distributing and merchandising 
cigarettes increased faster 
the united states has had an excise tax on cigarettes since 1862 
grise said and since 1969 all states have imposed such taxes along 
with an increasing number of local governments 
iowa was the first state to impose a cigarette tax in 1921 and 
by 1950 40 states and the district of columbia were taxing 
cigarettes rates now range from 2 cents per pack of 20 cigarettes 
in north carolina the leading producer to 38 cents in minnesota 
grise said that makes a weighted us average tax of about 18 cents 
per pack 
the increase in spending on cigarettes in the 1980s has largely 
gone to manufacturers he said the farm value of cigarette 
expenditures was actually 100 million less in 1987 than in 1980 
tobacco farmers in 1980 received 75 cents of each dollar spent 
by cigarette users but in 1987 growers got only 4 cents grise said 
meantime the manufacturers share of each dollar spent rose 
from 35 cents to 44 he said the distributors share stood at 
24 cents in 1980 but retreated to 23 cents in 1987 
federal excise taxes edged to 14 cents of the consumer dollar 
last year from 13 cents in 1980 back in the 1950s and 1960s 
federal taxes accounted for up to 35 cents of each cigarette dollar 
grise said state and local taxes rose to more than 20 cents of 
each dollar in the 1970s and early 1980s but dropped to about 15 
cents in 1987 
of about 335 billion spent on cigarettes last year grise said 
the farm value was approximately 135 billion the manufacturing 
share 149 billion wholesaling and retailing 762 billion 
federal taxes 473 billion and state and local taxes 495 
billion

democrats are confident they will keep their 
controlling grip on the us senate no matter which party wins the 
white house in tuesdays election 
party organizers even hope to chip away at republican senate 
seats perhaps bolstering their 5446 majority by one or more seats 
republicans however say the momentum is turning in their favor 
in races across the country while conceding that every tight race 
will have to break in their favor if they are to stand even a chance 
of regaining the senate control they lost two years ago 
strategists in both parties say an unusual volatility in the 
electorate this year adds an element of uncertainty that could lead 
to electionnight surprises 
as the campaign moved into its final hours gop senate candidates 
in states in which polling has given vice president george bush wide 
margins over democratic rival michael dukakis have moved to identify 
themselves with bush and his political themes 
political money flowed freely the federal election commission 
reported that as of oct 19 senate candidates of both parties had 
raised a total of 1575 million 
the most expensive race in the country to date california where 
sen pete wilson rcalif spent more than 10 million and 
democratic lt gov leo mccarthy spent more than 5 million the 
race was a tossup on the eve of the election 
overall it appeared to be a good year for most incumbents who 
attracted the lions share of campaign contributions in many of 
their races it appears to be a case of no contest 
most of the 15 democratic incumbents seeking reelection appear 
to be safe cushioned by leads of 10 or more points only three of 
the 12 republicans seeking further sixyear terms appear to be in 
trouble 
among democrats late polling showed sen frank lautenberg 
dnj pulling ahead of former army brig gen pete dawkins after 
weeks of harshly negative campaigning 
sen john melcher dmont was locked in a headtohead contest 
with rival republican conrad burns with melcher recycling television 
ads featuring talking cows from his 1982 campaign in this case the 
cows call burns a greenhorn who would be out of his depth in 
washington 
among republican incumbents strong challenges are being mounted 
for the seats held by sen david karnes rneb chic hecht rnev 
and lowell weicker rconn karnes appeared headed for defeat while 
hecht and weicker were battling down to the finish 
but much of the action revolves around three of the six seats 
being vacated by retiring senators three republicans and three 
democrats 
there are clear favorites in virginia mississippi and vermont 
former democratic gov charles robb is widely expected to capture 
the seat being vacated by oneterm sen paul trible rva rep 
trent lott rmiss the house republican whip is favored to take 
the seat of the senates most senior democrat john stennis who is 
retiring and rep jim jeffords rvt is favored to win the seat 
of retiring sen robert stafford rvt 
the three others in florida washington and wisconsin are 
tossups and may contain a key to the final outcome of the 1988 
senate campaign 
in wisconsin millionaire businessman herb kohl the democrat 
has outspent republican susan engeleiter the minority leader of the 
state senate and held onto a shrinking lead despite criticism he has 
never before held public office 
in florida republican rep connie mack iii was locked in a tight 
battle with democrat rep buddy mackay for the seat being vacated by 
democrat lawton chiles 
a dead heat for the seat being left by sen daniel evans 
rwash has developed between former gop sen slade gorton and rep 
mike lowry dwash 
lowry has run a series of negative ads including one accusing 
gorton of voting against the environment in his previous senate 
term 
the gorton camp retaliated recruiting evans for a television 
spot in which he accuses lowry of distorting gortons record and 
tells him mike youve been spreading so much stuff ive had to 
change my shoes 
the camera then pulls back the picture widens and evans dressed 
in a threepiece business suit displays dirtsplattered work boots 
viewing the horseraces democratic and republican strategists saw 
it this way 
sen john kerry dmass chairman of the senate democratic 
campaign committee the democrats will hold 54 seats at a minimum 
and i believe have a very good chance to add there is a unique 
volatility in the electorate 
tom mason spokesman for the senate republican campaign 
committee we are probably more enthusiastic about our chances now 
than at any point in the cycle we think the momentum is going our 
way almost across the board but we will have to win all the close 
ones but its still quite volatile out there and we could still 
end up on election day minus two but we could just as easily be 
plus two or better

autonomy to new caledonia and permit an independence referendum in 
1998 on the south pacific territory but turnout was light and many 
white islanders voted no 
the government of socialist premier michel rocard is hoping the 
statute which passed sunday will buy 10 years of peace in the 
islands that have suffered from intercommunal violence since 1984 
the statute includes a development program for native melanesians 
with all votes in except from a few caribbean territories 80 
percent of the vote was in favor of the new statute and 20 percent 
against turnout however was a mere 373 percent the worst 
showing for any national election since the end of world war ii 
the archipelago of new caledonia 11000 miles from paris has 
been rent by periodic violence between the native melanesians known 
as kanaks and white european settlers 
kanaks most of whom favor independence make up 43 percent of 
new caledonias 145000 inhabitants the settlers most of whom want 
to remain french are 37 percent the rest of the population is made 
up of polynesians and asians who generally favor france 
after another round of violence last spring that left 25 people 
dead kanak leader jeanmarie tjibaou and jacques lafleur leader of 
the antiindependence forces signed an agreement with rocard on the 
islands future 
tjibaou and lafleur demanded a referendum to seal the deal 
but tjibaou lafleur and rocard did not get strong national 
backing for their plan only 145 million of frances 38 million 
voters cast ballots and of them 13 percent cast blank or invalid 
ballots 
in new caledonia itself turnout was much higher at 637 percent 
but the approval much less yes received 5703 percent and 
no 429 the opposition vote was largely in the south where 
most of the european population lives in noumea the capital and 
white settler heartland 637 percent voted against the plan 
democracy has spoken rocard said after the polls closed 
it appears that 12 million french have just approved the statute 
this statute is from now on the law of france 
the draft law voted on in the referendum proposes a new local 
autonomy statute for new caledonia the seventh since the end of 
world war ii it divides the archipelago into three provinces each 
with its own provincial assembly and local administration 
the law also provides amnesty for any person charged with actions 
of a political nature before aug 20 except murder 
it also provides for a program of economic development in 
melanesian areas and training of local residents to assume 
administrative tasks 
tjibaou admitted that the 429 percent no vote is very 
large it is a significant handicap for the future we must be very 
vigilant

a 125pound great dane named cinnamon has 
gov thomas h kean to thank for a reprieve of sorts that allowed it 
to stay with its family 
an insurance company had told william and tina slack they either 
had to get rid of the dog or stop operating a day care center in 
their home 
branchvillebased selective insurance co of america told the 
slacks a large dog like cinnamon might endanger young children mrs 
slack said sunday 
basically their hands were tied she said of the company 
they didnt have much choice as far as the law is concerned 
she said no other insurance company would talk to them about a 
daycare policy except selective and the family had to think of a 
solution 
the family needed the money from the daycare operation to help 
pay the mortgage on their new house mrs slack said her husband is 
a pastor 
faced with the thought of life without cinnamon their daughter 
11yearold kristy wrote a letter to kean and started what has 
become known as the cinnamon affair 
a week later the slacks received a letter from the governors 
office which said they could expect to hear about the case in a few 
days mrs slack said 
but kristy grew impatient called the office and was told that 
her case had been sent to a higher state official 
a few days later mrs slack said the family received a personal 
phone call from kean who told them a compromise had been worked out 
and they could keep the 3yearold dog 
the family will have to keep her in a kennel in the backyard when 
children are being cared for 
kean placed a few calls to state insurance commissioner kenneth 
merin and selective insurance co executives said carl golden the 
governors press secretary 
here was a case that the governor felt was something that he 
could involve himself in and hopefully bring it to a successful 
conclusion which he did golden said who added that kean is a 
longtime dog lover

starring in a new movie about rape brought back 
nightmares for actress kelly mcgillis who says she was raped 
sodomized and beaten in 1982 by two men who broke into her new york 
apartment 
miss mcgillis spoke about the ordeal in this weeks people 
magazine 
her new film the accused is strongly reminiscent of a 
gangrape in a bar in new bedford mass where bystanders allegedly 
watched and cheered she plays the assistant district attorney who 
prosecutes the bystanders 
the 31yearold actress says she turned down the role of the 
victim which went to jodie foster because i have been a victim 
in real life and had no need to recreate it on screen 
after filming the accused and hearing two rape victims tell 
their stories she decided to go public with her own story 
i thought that my not talking about my own experience was the 
most cowardly act of my life she said i dont think im going 
to change the world but if i can make the difference in one 
persons life then telling my story has been worth it 
two men were arrested one served more than three years in 
prison charges against the other man were dismissed for lack of 
evidence

sen dan quayle is calling democrat michael 
dukakis the frightening candidate for president saying dukakis 
has no foreign policy credentials 
answering questions sunday as he entered the homestretch of the 
1988 campaign quayle said he was offended by dukakis suggestion 
that he would be unfit to head a white house crisis management team 
in a bush administration 
the gop vice presidential candidate said that dukakis has 
absolutely no experience in foreign policy the only foreign policy 
hes had is conversing with the governor of new hampshire 
the indiana senator struck back at dukakis a day after the 
democratic standardbearer said the notion of quayle involved in 
sensitive national security matters was a frightening thing 
quayle scheduled a tour of a westinghouse plant near baltimore 
today before flying to roanoke va for a rally and then to his 
home state of indiana 
quayle was rounding out his campaign with an appearance in south 
bend ind he planned to dine privately with family and friends in 
indianapolis tonight cast his ballot and return here tuesday night 
to await the election results 
while carrying out a modest campaign schedule consisting of an 
appearance at the historic berkeley plantation in southeastern 
virginia sunday quayle was asked at several points if the bush 
campaign organization was intentionally giving him a lowprofile 
schedule in the campaigns waning days 
i think you probably better unfog your glasses he told a 
bespectacled reporter who raised the question im right here 
were very versatile very flexible we go to good ones solid 
republican states bad ones democratic states and in between 
wherever they say 
the question was raised because quayle in recent days has made 
appearances in mostly small media markets and with the exception of 
kentucky maryland and west virginia states considered safely in 
the republican column 
bush spokesman mark goodin who accompanied quayle on the 
virginia trip said that sending the senator into traditionally 
strong republican states is part of a strategy not to hide quayle 
but to have the senator work to keep republican backers from taking 
bushs election for granted 
quayles ire was raised by statements that dukakis made in 
response to questions in an associated press interview the governor 
was asked about what he thought about bushs suggestion in an 
interview with british television personality david frost that he 
would put quayle in charge of a crisis management team if elected 
dan quayle dukakis askedin charge of managing the most 
serious crises we face in the country thats a frightening thing 
isnt it 
quayle standing next to his plane before commencing his campaign 
activities sunday snapped back well the frightening thought is 
president michael dukakis he is truly the frightening candidate 
hes the one thats truly frightening in the area of foreign 
policy in any kind of crisis 
asked what he would do if put in charge of a crisis management 
team in a bush administration quayle said only same thing george 
bush has done 
president reagan gave bush a similar assignment early in his 
administration in a move that contributed to alexander m haig jrs 
resignation as secretary of state there has been little definitive 
record of what bush did in that capacity although he has been 
credited by some in the administration as having played a principal 
role in overseeing the us invasion of grenada 
quayle said last week he thought he could be a valuable foreign 
policy adviser to bush because of his service on congressional 
foreign affairs committees sen phil gramm rtexas appearing with 
quayle at a campaign rally in louisiana credited the indiana 
senator with helping to get the intermediaterange nuclear forces 
inf treaty ratified by the senate

divorce lawyer arnie becker may be a hotshot 
attorney in the fictional legal world of televisions la law 
but his reallife peers say they wouldnt want to invite him to join 
their group 
after a panel discussion titled arnie becker how real is 
he members of the american academy of matrimonial lawyers voted 
5014 against the notion of extending an invitation to becker to 
join their association 
the hypothetical matter came up saturday at the start of a 
fourday meeting devoted mostly to weightier issues such as custody 
and surrogacy and the economic hardships that nofault divorce have 
caused some women 
but leonard loeb president of the academy credits beckers 
character with raising awareness of the legal specialty however he 
said its impossible to know whether the character actually has 
influenced members of the profession 
the character is bigger than life but not unreal said loeb 
and were up closer than most people we see the warts and 
freckles we understand many of the things he goes through i 
suppose the jury is still out to what extent the portrayal has 
helped 
among those sitting in on the becker panel was bill finkelstein 
an la law story editor and producer who writes beckers 
character played by actor corbin bernsen for the nbctv show 
im not comfortable thinking about arnie or any other character 
strictly as a role model because dramatically thats too limiting 
a standard to hold him to said finkelstein an attorney who put 
aside his practice while working on la law 
like everybody else arnie has different sides some heroic and 
some anything but heroic arnie has done things that if someone i 
knew in real life had id say what a jerk 
by the same token finkelstein said hes done some things 
i greatly admire and in this company in dress behavior and other 
measures id say hes basically middle of the pack there are a 
fair share of matrimonial lawyers more flamboyant than arnie 
needless to say the vote probably wont affect beckers 
television following 
besides fictional characters cannot join the elite academy 
which is comprised of only about 1000 of the nations 40000 
divorce lawyers the american bar associations family law section 
by contrast has about 16000 members 
despite the turndown one thing becker still has going for him is 
the perception that la law has not only glamorized the 
business but has encouraged more young people to enroll in law 
school 
enrollment is definitely up said finkelstein but i dont 
know whether that means i get the credit or the blame

not much traffic flows through this 
sleepy town on the ohio river but a rock store on its main drag 
boasts worldwide mailorder sales that owners claim make it a gold 
mine 
weve got the best business in town and people from around 
here dont even know it larry palmer 23 said of palmers 
trading post which he and his father john operate in this 
community of 468 people 
rocks are a good business youd be surprised 
john palmer established the store about 18 years ago to get away 
from the dangers of fluorite mining rocks always had fascinated 
him and he collected enough in his 16 years as a miner to go into 
business 
finding a beautiful rock is like looking at a beautiful 
woman he said recently you go wow thats why people 
collect rocks 
most of the trading posts rocks come from the area they carry 
prices ranging from 50 cents to 4000 and weigh up to 200 pounds 
the palmers rely mostly on local miners to help the store maintain a 
rock inventory in the thousands 
whats so amazing about our little store here larry palmer 
said is we can sit here all winter long and the only one who 
comes here is the mail carrier and were still making a living 
i just bought me a new car he said ive got one of the 
best jobs a guy in this country could have

the football practice field at columbiana 
high school is choked with foothigh grass this fall because 
financial problems have sidelined the football squad and other 
extracurricular activities 
we dont have a student newspaper we dont have plans for a 
yearbook we dont have any sports right now we are not planning on 
a prom said charles a winters principal at the towns 
350student high school 
the 1200 students in columbiana schools in northeastern ohio 
have lost extracurricular activities this school year because voters 
have rejected six tax levies since 1986 
a school tax increase is on tuesdays ballot 
other school systems in ohio have cut back sports because of 
money woes but the ohio high school athletic association said 
columbiana is the states only district without athletics this year 
as a result about eight athletes transferred to other school 
systems said superintendent roger stiller the latest departure was 
by a basketball player last week he said 
winters who went to the university of pittsburgh on a football 
scholarship said cutbacks in sports and other school programs could 
hurt some students chances to win scholarships and admission to 
college 
senior sheli farran who has played on the basketball volleyball 
and softball teams said the loss of high school activities has left 
columbiana teenagers without much to do in their spare time in this 
rural village of 4900 residents near youngstown 
it seems like you just come here you go to school and then 
you go home and you have to find your own thing to do she said 
theres a movie theater but you can only see the same movie so 
many times really theres nothing for the kids in this town 
school districts on the east and west coasts generally have 
avoided such cuts because of strong local economies but in the 
midwest where regions are suffering from stagnant economies cuts 
in sports music and drama are more common said john myers a 
spokesman for the denverbased national conference of state 
legislatures 
we have had the southern oilproducing and midwestern 
agricultural areas show sharply declining property tax revenues 
which presents the schools with less money to spend on activities 
he said 
myers said there are also efforts in some states to mandate a 
limit on property taxes thus reducing the amount of money available 
to schools 
columbiana school officials first made the cuts in 1986 
but a group of parents raised 92000 to cover the cost of the 
threatened activities through last school year paying for coaches 
sports equipment and a choir director with the donations winters 
said 
the whole time they were saying this is a one time shot for 
us we cant do this again so we need your support and we need this 
levy passed he said 
stiller said the average homeowner in the district pays 600 to 
650 in property taxes to the schools which he said is about 
average in the state 
i guess what we have here is a real division in the community 
between people who want those activities and people who either dont 
care or dont want them winters said folks who dont have kids 
or whose kids arent involved dont really see that as a part of 
education i guess

partisans of 29 statewide propositions 
californians face tuesday spent a record 130 million more than 9 
a voter on a media war involving issues like car insurance rates 
aids and raising cigarette taxes 
more than half the spending has centered on five conflicting 
propositions aimed at revamping the auto insurance ratesetting 
process and lowering premiums 
insurance companies alone fearing a budding car premium 
revolt poured more than 60 million into the battle and trial 
lawyers groups spent 15 million making it the most expensive 
single campaign in the country outside a presidential race 
this is the most massive financial attempt in corporate history 
to buy votes said consumer advocate ralph nader chief supporter 
of the proposition that would cut auto rates the most 
other hotly contested initiatives would raise cigarette taxes by 
a record 25 cents per pack override republican gov george 
deukmejians veto of a state worker safety program and tackle aids 
issues 
elsewhere tuesday maryland will decide whether to keep a 
6monthold law effectively banning cheap handguns michigan 
arkansas and colorado will tackle the issue of abortion financing 
south dakota utah and colorado will decide tax limitation proposals 
florida arizona and colorado voters will vote on whether to 
declare english their states official language and oregon voters 
will consider the toughest statewide smoking ban in the nation 
insurance companies have tried to convince california voters that 
the only real hope for rate relief would come from proposition 104 
which would create nofault auto insurance and cap attorney fees 
insurers have condemned the rival naderbacked proposition 103 
which would cut rates 20 percent and impose government regulation 
they also have criticized a rival measure backed by lawyers to cut 
auto premiums by 20 percent for good drivers and prohibit limiting 
lawyers fees 
despite the insurers blitz of television commercials polls 
showed voters favoring the naderbacked measure but a large 
undecided vote left the outcome unclear 
if two or more of the measures pass court battles may produce 
some unintended hybrid 
california proposition 102 backed by tax revolt champion paul 
gann would require doctors to report people who have aids to county 
public health offices it would also allow people charged with 
certain crimes to be tested for the deadly disease without their 
consent the measure has been opposed by state health authorities 
gann who contracted acquired immune deficiency syndrome in 1982 
from a blood transfusion and other supporters argued that they were 
tired of watching public health sacrificed in the name of civil 
rights proponents received a boost late in the campaign when 
deukmejian endorsed the measure 
a second aids measure would allow people charged with certain 
crimes to be tested for aids without their consent supporters 
claimed the measure would help protect victims of sex crimes police 
and firefighters but critics argued it could give victims a false 
sense of security 
polls indicated voters leaning toward adopting both aids measures 
the tobacco industry spent 18 million to defeat a measure that 
would raise cigarette taxes 25 cents per pack and use the money for 
research and health care programs but polls indicated the 
initiative could pass by a slim margin 
health experts argued in their lowbudget campaign that the 
measure would discourage smoking the industry called it an unfair 
tax that would trigger a crime wave by encouraging cigarette 
smuggling 
california proposition 97 meanwhile would in effect override 
deukmejians veto in 1987 when he wiped out the privateemployer 
portion of the california occupational safety and health act 
program known as calosha 
to supporters including labor groups the 7 million program 
axed by the governor was the nations finest worker safety system 
far more effective than its federal counterpart to deukmejian it 
was a wasteful state bureaucracy that duplicated federal efforts 
polls indicated voters may pass the measure 
the california ballot has been stretched even further by hundreds 
of local measures across the state san francisco voters must wade 
through 25 additional propositions including two involving the 
basing of the uss missouri the battleship on which the japanese 
surrendered during world war ii an advisory measure in berkeley 
supports palestinian selfdetermination 
the lengthy ballot prompted some counties to announce they would 
apply a 10minute limit on time spent in voting booths in order to 
avert long lines that prompted a challenge by civil rights groups 
who on friday won a temporary restraining order from a federal 
judge but on sunday the 9th us circuit court of appeals overruled 
the lower court and approved the 10minute limit

portauprince haiti ap one of haitis most powerful men a 
colonel indicted on us drug charges who until recently led the 
countrys most feared army unit has died under suspicious 
circumstances a family friend says 
col jeanclaude paul who was forcibly retired sept 30 as 
commander of the dessalines battalion died about 3 pm sunday of a 
heart attack in his home in suburban fermathe radio haitiinter 
said he was 49 
the independent station gave no other details but a family 
friend said there was speculation the 29year army veteran was 
poisoned 
pauls maid and gardener were detained by police for questioning 
said the family friend who would not be identified further 
in addition the colonels former wife mireille delinois was 
taken to the petionville police station for protection because of 
fear of reprisals by pauls relatives the friend said 
the military governments spokesman frantz lubin said he had no 
information on pauls death us embassy spokeswoman susan clude 
also said she had nothing 
paul was stripped of his command after a sept 17 revolt by 
noncommissioned officers ousted haitis military leader lt gen 
henri namphy 
the coup leaders who said they were outraged by statesponsored 
murder under namphy replaced him with lt gen prosper avril and 
ousted about 60 of the armys most repressive commanders 
paul at first appeared allied with avril but the new leader 
reportedly became concerned paul might turn against him last month 
avril said he planned to close the barracks of the 700man 
dessalines battalion the most brutal unit in haitis 7000member 
army 
the unit has been linked to the tonton macoutes the hated 
private army of the 29year duvalier family dictatorship and some 
of its members have been blamed for widespread violence that has 
thwarted moves toward democratization promised after a popular 
uprising drove jeanclaude duvalier into exile in february 1986 
the violence included attacks on polling stations that forced the 
cancellation of independently run general elections last november 
leaving at least 34 people dead 
paul had been a powerful force in the army which has run this 
impoverished caribbean nation for most of its 144 years the 
barracks of his former command are adjacent the presidential palace 
in march paul was indicted by a federal grand jury in miami on 
charges of conspiring to import cocaine into the united states 
the soldiers who ousted namphy said they wanted to name him army 
chief but decided not to because of the drug charges 
haitian and diplomatic sources later said pauls retirement could 
help lead to the renewal of a 70 million annual aid package the 
united states cut off after the november 1987 election massacre 
the drug trafficking indictment alleges paul conspired to import 
220 pounds of cocaine into the united states in december 1986 it 
says the traffickers used a landing strip on pauls farm 90 miles 
outside portauprince the capital to load and fly the shipment to 
the bahamas 
fritz pierrelouis a former lieutenant in the haitian army who 
later defected told sens alfonse damato rny and bob graham 
dfla in a special us senate hearing that 70 percent of pauls 
troops were involved in drug trafficking 
namphy led a military junta that assumed power when jeanclaude 
duvalier fled into exile in france 
an attempt to dismiss paul in june failed and led to the fall of 
the civilian government of leslie f manigat who had won 
militaryrun presidential elections in january 
namphy had tried to reassign paul to an administrative post but 
paul refused and was backed by manigat namphy ousted manigat on 
june 20 accusing him of meddling in army affairs and paul remained 
head of his battalion 
paul did not intervene when soldiers overthrew namphy in 
september 
the soldiers who formed haitis new government have said they 
want to end random statesponsored violence and institute 
democratic reforms but the government has set no dates for 
elections

democrat bruce sundlun hurling 
allegations of unethical conduct has battled to a dead heat against 
republican gov edward diprete and kept up the attack in an 
eleventhhour gubernatorial debate 
turning around a question on education sunday the millionaire 
communications executive said i think you ought to start 
educating our children on the need for honesty and integrity in 
state government ethics its taught in the sixth grade 
rhode island is one of 12 states selecting governors tuesday 
democrats are given a good chance of retaking the office in utah 
west virginia and indiana nine incumbents six republicans and 
three democrats are on ballots 
the gubernatorial race here is the most expensive in rhode island 
history with each candidate spending about 2 million sundlun 68 
has contributed 19 million out of his own pocket 
sundlun who lost to diprete by a landslide in 1986 robbed the 
twoterm governor of an early commanding lead by raising questions 
about dipretes private business deals alleged favoritism in the 
awarding of state contracts and the hiring last month of the exwife 
of a reputed mobster for a state job 
diprete 54 has stressed the states economic recovery in his 
four years in office citing increased spending on education and day 
care and challenging sundlun on sunday to say what he would do 
differently he has also accused his opponent of business misconduct 
and mismanagement 
a wlnetv poll friday and saturday gave sundlun 44 percent to 43 
percent for diprete a wpritv poll wednesday and thursday gave 
diprete 47 percent to sundluns 46 percent both surveys had margins 
of error of roughly 5 points 
weve seen all this negativeness and i think that adds a new 
dimension to the undecided vote said brown university political 
science professor darrell west theyre not going to be able to 
resolve their indecision because neither of the candidates has given 
them a reason to vote for them 
pollsters said undecided voters were relying on sundays hastily 
arranged televised debate to help them make up their minds but 
neither candidate took the experts advice that sundlun talk issues 
and diprete confront the ethics questions 
were here today to talk about issues said the governor 
accused by sundlun of using his political influence in a family land 
deal that netted him 400000 i think the public is fed up with 
your mudslinging quite frankly 
sundlun who has attacked diprete for increasing spending 45 
percent appeared nonplussed and had to grope for an answer when 
diprete asked him what would you cut the democrat said he 
would stop hiring outside lawyers for state business and reduce 
spending by the governors office 
elsewhere west virginia gov arch moore a republican trailed 
far behind democrat gaston caperton democrat evan bayh the son of 
former us sen birch e bayh led gop lt gov john m mutz in 
indiana and in utah gov norm bangerter erased a 30point deficit 
to draw even with democrat ted wilson 
democrats hold 27 of the 50 governorships republican robert orr 
of indiana is barred by law from a third term montana democrat ted 
schwinden and new hampshire republican john sununu are retiring

a us appeals court cleared the way for 
california election officials to put a 10minute limit on each 
persons time in a voting booth saying there was no evidence the 
cap would be rigidly enforced 
the 9th us court of appeals ruled sunday that a lower courts 
temporary restraining order blocking at least three counties from 
applying some measure of the 97yearold law was unjustified 
appeals judge stephen reinhardt of los angeles wrote that the 
statute had not previously been enforced rigidly or in a way that 
unduly restricted the ability to vote of people who do not speak 
english as their primary language 
the court has rightly recognized that this standard that has 
been in use for nearly 100 years is an appropriate reminder to the 
voter said chief deputy secretary of state tony miller 
he added that no elections official is going to reject any 
bodies from the booths but many instead could now diplomatically 
tell voters tuesday to complete ballots as quickly as possible 
the issue was raised when marin sonoma and santa clara counties 
announced they would use the law to speed people through voting 
because of an unusually long ballot with 29 statewide propositions 
and anticipation of a record turnout 
civil rights groups challenged the limit on friday us 
district judge robert p aquilar ruled in san jose that the time 
limit amounted to a literacy test which is outlawed by the federal 
voting rights act 
the appeals court did not rule on that issue saying it could be 
decided in a trial 
in arguing for the limit deputy state attorney general robert 
murphy said long lines could discourage voters from entering polls 
effectively disenfranchising them for the sake of those with 
language difficulties who do not take advantage of absentee ballots 
were concerned that if people think there is no time limit 
people will tarry will take all the time they can get miller had 
said earlier 
the lawsuit challenging the limit was brought on behalf of 
hispanic and asian minorities by the mexican american legal defense 
fund the american civil liberties unions northern california 
chapter and the legal aid society of santa clara 
manuel a romero of the legal defense fund argued sunday that 
requiring nonenglish speaking voters to transfer ballot choices 
from a secondlanguage sample ballot mandates a certain level of 
literacy 
but murphy and james emerson santa claras deputy county 
counsel said voting that way requires only basic mechanical skills 
after the ruling romero said it indirectly validated his 
concerns 
it says what weve been saying that in the absence of any 
history of this being rigidly applied in the past if business 
continues as usual with no strict literal enforcement then 
theres no problems he said 
a record 105 million people are expected at the polls or 752 
percent of registered voters according to secretary of state march

a 20yearold man told a judge he 
wants to serve time for car theft and forgery in prison because the 
county jail is too boring 
i cant sit that long in the county jail because it will drive 
me crazy robert r couture said theres nothing to do if i go 
to prison i can go to school i can get a job go to work camp 
couture asked jefferson county superior court judge william 
howard on friday to delay his plea on three counts of forgery until 
after couture is sentenced in snohomish county on a car theft charge 
jefferson county deputy prosecuting attorney steve olsen said 
couture wanted to plead guilty to the car theft charge first so that 
sentence will be added to his forgery sentence 
sentences over one year are served in state prisons less than a 
year in a county jail 
public defender crad verser told the court that the snohomish 
county prosecutor will recommend that couture be sentenced to two 
months in jail for the car theft the standard range the court could 
impose is twotofive months 
on the forgery charges the most couture could get is under 12 
months which would mean jail time 
but with the sentences from both counties added together couture 
could be sent to prison for 12 to 14 months 
couture said he fears that if he had to languish in jail hed be 
so restless hed end up back in court on other charges before 
completing his sentence 
howard accepted the two attorneys recommendations and delayed 
coutures arraignment on the three forgery counts until january

andrei sakharov arrived on his first journey 
outside the soviet union declaring himself a free man and speaking 
out for a supporter jailed over a protest on behalf of the nobel 
laureate nearly eight years ago 
the human rights activist told reporters at logan international 
airport on sunday night that dissident mathematician vazif meilanov 
was imprisoned after staging a oneman protest on his behalf and now 
faces additional charges 
i feel it is my duty now at this moment to remember this man 
and many others who remain in prison sakharov said 
sakharov winner of the 1975 nobel peace prize for his defense of 
human rights is scheduled to spend two weeks in the united states 
visiting relatives undergoing medical tests and promoting a new 
international organization 
the trip comes less than two years after he was freed from 
internal exile in the industrial city of gorky where he had been 
sent because of his outspoken opposition to the soviet invasion of 
afghanistan 
using stepdaughter tatiana yankelevich as a translator the tall 
balding 67yearold spoke for about 10 minutes but refused to answer 
questions he appeared rumpled and tired after a 14hour flight from 
moscow 
two years ago i became a free man when i returned from gorky 
to moscow sakharov said now i have become even freer because i 
have been granted the right to travel around the world 
but a man who staged a oneperson demonstration on my behalf in 
january 1980 when i was exiled to gorky remains in prison the name 
of that man is vazif meilanov he has been charged once again with a 
very serious crime and faces a long imprisonment 
meilanov was a cellmate of natan sharansky who was deported in 
1986 for his human rights work sharansky who now lives in israel 
said last may that meilanov remained in siberia 
sakharov is traveling without his wife yelena bonner who saw 
him off with a kiss at sheremetyevo airport in moscow 
he was starting his trip with a visit to her daughter by a 
previous marriage mrs yankelevich mrs yankelevichs husband 
efrem and their two teenage children in suburban newton 
sakharov is expected to visit mrs bonners son alexei semyonov 
semyonovs wife liza alekseyeva and their 4yearold daughter 
alexandra in the nearby town of westwood it will be his first 
meeting with his granddaughter 
he is also scheduled to undergo a heart examination and may 
receive a pacemaker at massachusetts general hospital mrs bonner 
had cardiac bypass surgery at the hospital in january 1986 
sakharov is expected to travel to new york then washington 
where he will participate in a board meeting nov 1317 of the 
international foundation for the survival and development of 
humanity the first such session outside the soviet union 
the foundation formed in january by soviet and us scientists 
and educators is embarking on a worldwide campaign to raise 10 
million for research on global problems 
sakharov said sunday he believed my country and your 
country can do a great deal together for peace for a world that is 
happy and close and without hunger violence or disease 
he said that since childhood he has had a great deal of respect 
for the united states which is indeed a truly great country 
the granting of an exit visa for sakharov to visit the united 
states is a dramatic example of the changes in soviet society since 
mikhail s gorbachev became general secretary of the communist party 
in 1985 
the foundation also played a role in obtaining the visa said 
jerome wiesner president emeritus of the massachusetts institute of 
technology and the foundations vice chairman 
the foundations position was not to meet outside the soviet 
union unless all the board members could attend and that meant the 
soviet government had to change its position and give sakharov 
permission to travel wiesner said at logan airport 
sakharov was a top soviet physicist and helped develop its 
hydrogen bomb in the 1950s but became a dissident leader in the 
1970s he was exiled to gorky a city about 250 miles from moscow 
in january 1980 a month after the soviets invaded afghanistan his 
wife was banished to gorky in august 1984 
they remained there until gorbachev called them back to moscow in 
december 1986 earlier that year gorbachev had told a french 
newspaper sakharov could not travel outside the soviet union because 
he knew too many state secrets 
sakharov has continued his scientific work and now concentrates 
on the origins of the universe he speaks out occasionally on human 
rights issues

a man has surrendered after more 
than two years of keeping his identity a privileged secret and has 
given an unapologetic confession to fatally running down a drunken 
man on a dark beach road 
i didnt know what i had hit william d morser a delray 
beach restaurateur said sunday after he was charged with leaving 
the scene of the march 9 1986 accident in which mark baltes was 
dragged 60 feet to his death 
i realized i had run over something that was not a garbage bag 
or not a bag of rags morser said it all happened very quickly 
what could i do at that point 
morser blamed baltes for being in the road in the middle of the 
night baltes 28 had a blood alcohol level of 026 percent more 
than 2 times floridas legal intoxication level 
if there is a jury that wont agree with that then im living 
in the wrong country morser said i feel like i have been the 
one taken advantage of not the one lying on the ground 
the hitandrun accident in posh palm beach gained national 
attention because morsers identity had remained a secret behind the 
attorneyclient privilege of confidentiality 
the day after the accident the driver contacted attorney barry 
krischer and asked him to keep his identity secret and negotiate a 
plea deal which fell through 
i was not about to walk into a police station and say hey 
fellas im raw meat come and get me morser said sunday 
on oct 13 palm beach county circuit judge timothy poulton 
upheld krischers right to keep the clients name secret 
meantime baltes parents appealed on cbstvs 60 minutes for 
information that might reveal the drivers identity and had offered 
a 1 million reward contingent upon them winning a lawsuit from the 
driver 
investigators first suspected morser on thursday after inspecting 
his white buick riviera which resembled the car that struck baltes 
police also learned that morser had recently moved out of a west 
palm beach apartment that he had been renting from kirscher since 
before the accident authorities said 
when investigators interviewed morser on friday at his 
restaurant he appeared nervous and gave evasive answers 
authorities said morser was ordered to the appear saturday at the 
prosecutors office where authorities say he admitted he was the 
driver who struck baltes 
morser was booked sunday on the felony and released without 
having to post bond 
his identity was discovered it was confirmed he was my client 
and i was called by the state attorneys office to produce my client 
for a compelled statement kirscher said 
a subpoena had been issued to compel morser to talk about the 
case kirscher said morser was given immunity in exchange for his 
statement about baltes death the attorney said 
the immunity means prosecutors will not be able to use morsers 
statement against him in court and must find other evidence to prove 
morser was behind the wheel of the car that killed baltes kirscher 
said 
mildred baltes and her exhusband joseph who had filed a 6 
million lawsuit against the unknown killer of their son said they 
were relieved the mystery was over 
its been costly both financially and emotionally said mrs 
baltes who lives in middletown ny she said she has spent 50000 
going back and forth to florida leading the efforts to find out who 
hit her son 
morser told reporters sunday the family was in it only for the 
money and he has been the real victim 
mrs baltes said thats absurd 
he gambled and he lost and he is trying to make us out to be 
the bad guys she said i happen to believe in justice for 
everybody my son is entitled to justice even though he is dead

some federal safety officials who have 
investigated two fatal airliner accidents are concerned that pilots 
may not always be focusing on the business at hand in the critical 
moments before takeoff 
federal investigators at the national transportation safety board 
are closely examining the tape covering nearly 30 minutes in the 
cockpit of delta air lines flight 1141 last august before the boeing 
727 crashed seconds after takeoff killing 14 of the 108 people 
aboard 
more than half of the tape covering a lengthy taxi period at the 
huge dallasforth worth international airport involves idle chatter 
among the pilots and two flight attendants on subjects ranging from 
the recent purchase of a house to birds nesting near airports 
nearly 11 minutes of the tape were omitted from the transcript 
because they were considered irrelevant including a reference 
according to sources of news reports a few days before the crash of 
chatter aboard a continental airlines that crashed in denver 10 
months earlier 
if there is an accident one participant in the delta cockpit 
reportedly reminded his colleagues their words might end up in the 
newspapers too 
later the delta planes captain told investigators he did not 
care for the lengthy presence of the flight attendants in the 
cockpit but that it was not his nature to order them from the 
cockpit during the long takeoff delay 
investigators emphasized that so far there has been no clear 
evidence linking these conversations some of which was technically 
legal because the plane was not moving with the possible cause of 
the crash 
but investigators are trying to determine whether the flight crew 
forgot to properly set the jetliners wing flaps which help it gain 
lift and whether the conversations distracted them from preparing 
the plane for flight 
an exchange lasting 7 minutes and 42 seconds between copilot 
carey kirkland and a senior flight attendant began as the crew was 
going through one of the preflight check lists finally the 
exchange was cut short by capt larry davis prompting an apology 
from kirkland about sittin here talking to the flight 
attendant according to the transcript 
later flight engineer steven judd told investigators he had been 
uneasy about the attendants lengthy presence 
while there is no link established between these discussions and 
the accident some ntsb investigators are uneasy about the casual 
and relaxed demeanor the exchanges reflect 
furthermore several aviation safety officials not involved with 
the delta investigation suggested such extraneous discussions before 
takeoff are common 
its very difficult to legislate against people interacting in 
a job situation says clay foushee an aviation safety researcher 
at nasas ames research center in california 
foushee said while some casual exchanges may help a flight crew 
feel at ease and work together there also have been numerous pilot 
complaints received through nasas anonymous aviation reporting 
system over the years about pilot distractions including 
inappropriate conversation and untimely presence in the cockpit of 
flight attendants 
earlier this year the ntsb in its final report on the nov 15 
l987 crash of the continental airlines jetliner in denver also 
raised concerns about idle chatter in the cockpit that crash which 
killed 28 people was attributed to the pilot taking off in snow 
with ice on the wings 
four minutes before takeoff the two continental pilots engaged 
in almost three minutes of nonpertinent social conversation 
reportedly involving a flight attendant which would suggest 
inattention to more important details such as the weather and its 
effects on icing the safety board said 
since l981 the federal aviation administration has had a 
sterile cockpit rule that prohibits any conversation among 
flight crews not related to the operation of the aircraft when the 
plane is taxiing and in motion and when flying below 10000 feet in 
an approach or departure 
flight attendants also are specifically prohibited from entering 
the cockpit during those periods 
the requirement was prompted by concerns at the faa about an 
unusually high number of cases in the late l970s including several 
accidents in which pilots were distracted from their duties by idle 
chatter and other requirements such as making cabin announcements 
during critical phases of flight 
faa and other aviation officials concede they have no idea how 
often the rule is ignored violations are uncovered only if an faa 
inspector is aboard at which times chatter is unlikely or after 
an accident when the cockpit tape is reviewed 
but federal officials note that even if a violation is shown and 
the flight crew members survive an accident there is likely to be 
no faa disciplinary action because the contents of the cockpit 
recorder tape cannot be used either in court or as part of 
administrative action by the faa 
officials of unions representing pilots and flight attendants 
acknowledged that at times the sterile cockpit rule may be violated 
but they said for the most part it is widely adhered to lengthy 
delays before getting takeoff clearance adds to the problem they

return was expected to fuel concern over the fate of the bedridden 
emperor

condition for the time being maeda told reporters but doctors 
fear he may bleed again he said

a student suspected of unleashing a virus 
into an estimated 6000 computers nationwide tried frantically to 
warn operators after discovering his experiment had gone awry 
associates said 
robert t morris jr 23 a firstyear student in cornell 
universitys doctorate computer science program is suspected of 
creating the computer virus that last week clogged the computers 
tied to a military network 
he has been unavailable since discovery of the virus thursday 
his father robert t morris sr a government computersecurity 
expert said his son left the university thursday to avoid reporters 
the senior morris has refused to say whether his son created the 
virus 
the electronic virus so named because it multiplies after 
invading a computer jammed computers across the country linked to 
the pentagonsupported arpanet network slowing computers by 
reproducing itself over and over but affected centers reported the 
virus only took up memory space and did not destroy any files 
it could have been a whole lot worse said dexter kozen one 
of morris instructors he could have wreaked a lot more havoc i 
cant believe it was malicious mischievous yes 
friends of morris quoted today in the washington post said morris 
created the virus as an intellectual challenge and that the virus 
was supposed to lie dormant in computer systems 
morris reportedly went to dinner after setting the program loose 
wednesday night and checked it before going to bed discovering his 
mistake morris desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus 
spread 
his machines at cornell were so badly clogged he couldnt get 
the message out said mark friedell an assistant professor of 
computer science at harvard university where morris did his 
undergraduate studies 
panicked morris called andrew sudduth systems manager at 
harvards aiken laboratory he asked sudduth to send urgent messages 
to a computer billboard explaining how to defeat the virus sudduth 
told the post 
the nets computer networks were like molasses sudduth 
said it took me more than an hour to get anything out at all 
cornell officials said sunday they have no absolute proof that 
morris caused the virus but the evidence in the universitys 
computer system so far points to morris they said 
one cornell official who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
sunday that it appeared there was an early version of the virus in 
morris computer files 
the elder morris chief scientist at the national computer 
security center in bethesda md said the episode will clearly 
raise the awareness of the existing vulnerabilities particularly of 
network systems 
the father has written widely on the security of the unix 
operating system the target of his sons virus program and is 
widely known for writing a program to decipher passwords which give 
users access to computers 
morris said sunday his son planned to meet with a lawyer today 
and would not be available for comment until tuesday or wednesday 
hes concerned obviously said the father reached at his home 
in arnold md 
the fbi which is investigating whether any computer crime laws 
were broken have not yet spoken with his son he said 
the programmer who designed the networks electronic mail program 
that the virus invaded said he had forgotten to close a secret 
back door to the program the new york times reported today 
eric allman said he created the opening to make adjustments to 
the program but forgot to remove the entry point before the program 
was widely distributed in 1985 he was working for a programming 
organization at the university of california berkeley at the time 
paul graham a computer science graduate student at harvard and a 
friend of morris compared morris exploit to that of mathias rust 
the young west german who flew a light plane through soviet air 
defenses in may 1987 and landed in moscow 
its as if mathias rust had not just flown into red square but 
built himself a stealth bomber by hand and then flown into red 
square graham told the times

journalists calling them thieves and enemies and saying blacks 
dont want britishstyle democracy 
the hostile questionandanswer session followed his speech at 
the saturday night banquet put on by the foreign correspondents 
association 
i am sick and tired of a lot of foreign representatives 
descending on my country and picking up on all the dirty work

an argumentative exchange with one journalist 
you dont understand africa you dont understand african

want to quarrel with beautiful ladies i do better things with 
them 
he wondered out loud whether one questioner had psychological 
problems 
asked about the white minority governments suspension last week 
of the antiapartheid weekly mail newspaper botha said he supported 
the move 
he described the newspaper as one of the most vicious he has 
seen in his travels around the world and said it contributed to 
more violence in this country 
at the end of the hourlong impromptu debate the host offered to 
thank botha but the foreign minister refused to accept instead he 
returned from his seat to the podium and quoted a speech by paul 
kruger a 19th century south african politician 
krugers opening words were friends citizens thieves and 
enemies and that is how i look at you this evening botha said 
the audience responded with boos hisses and shouts of go 
home botha left shortly afterward before dessert was served 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in 
national affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and 
maintain separate districts schools and health services 
south africas media restrictions have been further tightened

moslem guerrillas surrounding this 
southern city say they are running low on weaponry while moscow 
supples new warplanes and missiles to the marxist government to 
repel the guerrillas advances 
one guerrilla leader says some fighters have acquired 
satelliteguided us mortars but supplies are limited and some of 
the weapons were destroyed by soviet bombings 
sovietafghan forces defending kandahar the countrys 
secondlargest city 300 miles southwest of the capital kabul bombed 
the area in the past week with newly introduced soviet mig27 jets 
the guerrillas said 
the official soviet news agency tass reported the afghan army 
killed more than 300 guerrillas near kandahar and other areas from 
friday through sunday 
staterun radio kabul monitored in london reported that 
guerrilla attacks killed 33 people in the same period including 30 
it said died when a missile hit a bus near kandahar 
the soviets said last week that they have suspended their troop 
withdrawal from afghanistan and have sent advanced weapons to their 
southern neighbor because of unrelenting pressure from the 
anticommunist guerrillas known as the mujahedeen or islamic holy 
warriors 
among weaponry newly introduced in kabul are ss1 scud missiles 
which are capable of reaching pakistan 120 miles away 
ussupplied antiaircraft stinger missiles that once sent 
soviet fighter jets fleeing to higher altitudes are in short supply 
and jealously hoarded said guerrillas in the kandahar area 
the air is the only trouble for mujahedeen not military 
installations on the ground said abdul wali a guerrilla commander 
in the area 
kandahar sits in the middle of an arid plain that offers little 
protection from marauding aircraft that have leveled the citys 
southern suburb of mahalajat 
the mig27s first supplied by moscow around oct 23 drop their 
bombs without decoy flares used before a raid to fool heatseeking 
missiles 
they must know they have nothing to fear anymore said a 
western diplomat in islamabad pakistan who spoke on condition he 
not be identified 
gul lalai a guerrilla commander said he examined 
satelliteguided mortars at a base south of kandahar and run by the 
hardline hezbeislami guerrilla group 
nonguerrilla sources in pakistan have also confirmed the 
fourbarrel 120mm weapons were supplied to the insurgents 
gulbaddin hekmatyar who heads the hezbeislami has denied 
receiving any foreign aid and the united states has refused to 
publicly acknowledge the weapons existence in afghanistan 
guerrillas who used their limited technological expertise to 
describe the mortar said a satellite acts as a spotter sending 
coordinates to the launcher which is equipped with a screen and a 
small receiver 
mujahedeen fighters fire two rockets in the direction of the 
target and the satellite does the mathematical equation that locks 
it in there was no word on the mortars range 
however the insurgents say supplies are limited and two of the 
mortars were destroyed when the mig27s blasted rebel positions east 
of kandahar airport late last month 
in the latest fighting guerrillas reported heavy bombing around 
kandahar during the past week that killed at least nine people and 
injured 80 
tass reported that guerrillas on sunday fired three rockets into 
kabul but did not say if there were any casualties 
it said that over the weekend the afghan army killed 153 
guerrillas in fighting around kandahar and in the settlements of 
turkotal and sarpuza it said troops attacked an armed gang in 
zabol province killing 150 guerrillas and wounding 52 people 
including a pakistani adviser 
under terms of the unmediated geneva accords reached in april 
the soviets agreed to withdraw the estimated 100000 troops it sent 
into afghanistan since 1979 to help the moscowbacked kabul 
government fight off the guerrillas about half the troops have been 
pulled out 
but on friday moscow said it halted the second half of the 
pullout that was to be completed by feb 15

the soviet union celebrated its 71st anniversary 
today with a traditional display of military might on red square 
and the top us diplomat attended for the first time since the 
soviets intervened in afghanistan 
the parade commemorating the bolshevik revolution took on less of 
a political character than in past years of higher international 
tension defense minister dmitri t yazov criticized western defense 
policies in a short and comparatively mild speech and banners 
displayed on the square had an almost exclusively domestic economic 
character 
president mikhail s gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
walked onto lenins mausoleum and acknowledged the applause of the 
crowd alone at the center of the reviewing stand in contrast to 
previous years the other members of the communist partys ruling 
politburo followed far behind them 
moscow party leader lev n zaikov stood on gorbachevs right 
throughout the parade a possible indication that he has moved up in 
the party leadership 
yegor k ligachev a conservative who formerly was regarded as 
the no 2 kremlin leader stood next to ryzhkov an indication he 
has fallen in the hierarchy 
all 11 moscowbased members of the politburo attended the 
gathering marking the anniversary of the seizure of power by the 
bolsheviks in 1917 the annual event is often one of the clearest 
indicators of changes in the hierarchy 
some of the soviet unions most sophisticated military 
technology including ss21 surfacetosurface missiles t72 tanks 
antiaircraft weapons armored personnel carriers and rocket 
launchers followed western diplomats said there were no new weapons 
thousands of soldiers diplomats and spectators jammed moscows 
main square under blustery leaden skies a light snow fell the 
temperature was just below freezing and red square was adorned with 
a giant redandwhite portrait of lenin and political slogans 
john m joyce the us charge daffaires was at the parade 
said embassy spokesman richard gilbert 
it was the first time the top us diplomat in moscow attended 
the revolution day parade since the soviets sent soldiers to 
afghanistan in december 1979 gilbert said us ambassador jack f 
matlock was out of town and would have attended had he been in 
moscow 
ambassadors of other nato countries also attended the parade 
their return reflected the agreement signed in geneva april 14 under 
which half of the 100000 soviet soldiers have been withdrawn from 
afghanistan and the remainder are to leave by feb 15 
however fighting continues in afghanistan and the soviet union 
on friday said it was suspending its withdrawal because of 
continuing attacks by moslem rebels 
yazov reviewed the soldiers and sailors on red square and 
delivered a relatively mild message criticizing western military 
policies 
the destruction of medium and shorterrange nuclear weapons has 
just begun yet already there are calls for all kinds of 
compensation modernization the buildup of conventional arms and 
the stepping up of the star wars program he said 
following the speech divisions of the soviet unions top 
soldiers began the traditional parade through red square past 
lenins mausoleum 
thousands of people began gathering in the early morning cold 
hours earlier music was piped into streets that had been closed to 
traffic and marchers gathered on main thoroughfares carrying pink 
and yellow balloons toward red square 
they followed the soldiers and military vehicles onto the square 
with slogans such as war on bureaucracy and others supporting 
gorbachevs drive for economic reform

on a desolate nightmarish landscape strewn with 
rubbish and guarded by the barren gnarled skeleton of an old tree 
sits a shabby soiled man 
he is joined by an equally dirty and desperate companion who 
attempts to make some sense out of their existence in this 
inhospitable environment 
we are in the uncertain often bleak often funny world of samuel 
beckett and the two men vladimir and estragon are waiting for 
godot a mysterious person who never does arrive 
its the only thing you can be sure of in becketts enigmatic 
masterpiece which opened sunday in an allstar revival at lincoln 
centers mitzi newhouse theater 
star is the operative word in this production and the reason 
the revival is sold out for the rest of its run which ends nov 27 
its no accident that each of the plays two acts starts with a drum 
roll and clash of cymbals 
this waiting for godot has two of the countrys biggest comic 
talents steve martin and robin williams playing becketts 
memorable tramps they are joined by academy awardwinning actor f 
murray abraham and clown bill irwin as the archetypal master and 
servant pozzo and lucky lukas haas is the young messenger from the 
unseen godot 
what the austere beckett would make of them is anybodys guess 
but the playwrights love of classic comedians is well known after 
all bert lahr starred in the original broadway production of 
godot in 1956 and beckett once wrote a film script for buster 
keaton 
this revival directed in high style and plenty of show biz glitz 
by mike nichols certainly has its quota of giggles yocks and even 
belly laughs at the productions last preview theatergoers sounded 
as if they were lapping up neil simons latest laughfest rather than 
becketts metaphysical musings 
many in the audience came for the stars not the play and they 
werent disappointed 
the scruffy williams sporting a beard and shaggy hair is a 
brilliant improviser and has a strong stage presence his estragon 
is a maniacal creature verging out of control at times but he can 
get a laugh out of the simplest of stage business such as pulling 
off a boot or trying to eat a raw carrot 
but he veers into some stage antics and line twistings that 
beckett never would have dreamed of giving hilarious imitations of 
such diverse cultural icons as r2d2 and john wayne complete with an 
improvised machine gun nichols should supply the stage manager with 
a net when things start to get too wild 
the graybearded martin has a tougher assignment playing the 
subdued almost straight man vladimir to williams more flamboyant 
estragon he doesnt quite succeed martin is a bit bland fading at 
times into tony waltons mesmerizing setting of white sand his 
voice is colorless too rarely rising above a monotone martin 
seems almost complacent and without that desperation needed to 
convey the authors sense of futility about life 
the unnerving expression of that futility is left to abraham and 
irwin in the secondary roles of pozzo and lucky abraham gives a 
bizarre idiosyncratic performance with an odd mafioso accent as 
the severe taskmaster still he manages to spit out with the proper 
bitterness becketts lament about life 
they give birth astride of a grave the light gleams an 
instant then its night once more he says its a jolting note 
considering all the laughs going on around him 
the usually boyish irwin looking like an old man in superb 
makeup by j roy helland is sensational as the abused servant 
lucky the actor is an accomplished mime as well as a comedian 
every gesture has been carefully thought out not only for the 
comedy but for the pain that lies underneath the laughs 
godot straddles both comedy and drama as beckett tries to 
grapple with fundamental questions of human existence at times the 
play teeters on despair while making the audience laugh out loud 
but nichols production pretty much gives up on the drama and maybe 
it doesnt matter with this cast godot can be enjoyed at its 
most superficial and comic level even though it rarely digs below 
the surface 
in the published text of the play waiting for godot is 
described as a tragicomedy in two acts the lincoln center 
revival concentrates on the laughs and gets them but by doing so 
it loses the haunting loneliness and tragedy that also permeate the 
play 
in other reviews howard kissel of the daily news wrote the 
virtue of nichols approach is that unlike many productions where 
becketts austerity and somberness are heightened by actors desire 
to make the work confusing and thus more profound this godot is 
direct accessible and entertaining even if the play rarely 
achieves pathos its ending is haunting because of jennifer tiptons 
masterful lighting 
clive barnes wrote in the new york post nichols is quite 
wonderful in timing the production in collaborating with his actors 
to hit every precise button as they come up this is an 
immaculate production that is a shade too selfconscious for its own 
perfection but one which in its care and precision has been like 
godot worth waiting for 
frank rich wrote in the new york times the naked realism of 
godot which belongs to no specific place or time but to all 
places and all time does not suit a director whose gift is for 
comedy strongly rooted in contemporary social detail rather than 
expanding his artistic reach to meet becketts nichols contracts 
the play to fit his own chilly esthetic audiences will still be 
waiting for a transcendent godot long after the clowns at lincoln 
center like so many others passing through becketts eternal 
universe before them have come and gone

the thirdranking communist rebel 
leader was captured at manila airport where he may have been 
planning to board a flight for los angeles under an assumed name 
officials announced today 
president corazon aquino said sundays capture of ignacio 
capegsan whom the military described as deputy secretarygeneral of 
the communist party of the philippines shows that her government is 
winning its struggle against the 19year marxist insurgency 
brig gen alexander aguirre capital regional commander said 
capegsan was captured sunday in the parking lot of ninoy aquino 
international airport 
capegsans wife cresteta was arrested today during a raid on 
the couples suburban quezon city home in which police seized 
weapons a personal computer and bank books for accounts totalling 
75000 officials said 
he was on his way to the usa particularly los angeles 
aguirre told reporters it is possible that he is being projected 
into the international commission of the communist party of the 
philippines 
later capegsan 42 told reporters at a police station that he 
had gone to the airport to see off his fatherinlaw lorenzo 
mercado who was on his way to california capegsan denied he 
planned to leave the country 
capt florenio angeles who made the arrest said capegsan 
dropped off his wife and fatherinlaw at the departure terminal and 
then drove his car to a nearby parking lot where he was taken into 
custody 
angeles said police were simply speculating that capegsan 
intended to fly to california too because there was no other 
explanation for parking the car access to the terminal is limited 
to ticketed passengers 
he said informants had told police capegsan planned to travel to 
the united states last month but canceled the trip 
military officials have claimed rebel representatives are raising 
funds among filipino expatriate communities abroad to finance the 
insurgency 
angeles said however that police found no ticket on capegsan 
and that philippine airlines had confirmed reservations only for the 
wife and fatherinlaw he said capegsan may have planned to fly 
standby 
angeles said police made no attempt to track down the wife and 
fatherinlaw inside the terminal but mrs capegsan returned home 
without boarding the flight and was arrested the following day 
during a brief appearance before reporters capegsan claimed he 
left the rebel movement in late 1986 after nearly 16 years in the 
underground because of fatigue and philosophical differences with 
other rebel leaders 
foreign reporters however saw him with rebels in december 1986 
during a nationwide 60day ceasefire 
according to the military capegsan is the highestranking member 
of the party to be arrested since secretarygeneral rafael baylosis 
was captured in march authorities say capegsan served as chairman 
of the partys northern luzon commission which directs rebel 
operations in the northern philippines 
capegsan told reporters he had been deputy chairman before

cardinal john oconnor honored jews and the holy 
laws of the torah in a mass marking the 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht the night of shatttered glass that ushered in the 
nazi holocaust 
the roman catholic cardinal said more than human decency demands 
the world remember the nazi atrocities 
otherwise we will be destroyed by the indifference that permits 
betrayers and killers to stalk the face of the earth oconnor 
said during a mass on sunday at st patricks cathedral 
oconnor has asked all 410 churches in the archdiocese of new 
york to ring their bells wednesday and parishioners to light candles 
on the anniversary he said he would light a memorial candle in the 
window of his residence that night 
on nov 910 1938 nazis rampaged against jews in major cities 
as well as those in small towns in germany and austria 
let us remind ourselves of the depth of gratitude that we owe 
to our jewish brothers and sisters who died who lived but 
ultimately survived survived because they preserved the law 
oconnor said holding the torah or first five books of the hebrew 
bible given him by jewish leaders soon after his arrival in new 
york city in 1984 
the attack became known as kristallnacht or crystal night 
because of the shards of broken glass that littered the streets it 
is considered the beginning of the german drive to exterminate jews 
an estimated 6 million jews and hundreds of thousands of others died 
at the hands of the nazis 
oconnor made the remarks during his annual mass for catholic 
lawyers and judges he reminded the legal community of its duty to 
preserve the law 
is it any wonder that the first lawyers were awed by their 
tasks that they were mandated to preserve the law to copy the law 
to teach the law to interpret the law above all to love the law 
he said without the law the heart is ripped out of judaism the 
heart is ripped out of the world 
among those at sundays mass were former gov hugh carey vincent 
mcconnell of the guild of catholic lawyers rabbi marc tanenbaum of 
the american jewish committee and dr yaffa eliach of the center for 
holocaust studies

hits me in the solar plexus i need to engage on that level to do 
roles that have something to say 
the actress said her next project is to tranform herself into the 
title character of evita the musical about argentine dictator 
juan perons charismatic wife eva peron 
she said the part has been offered to her but filming wont

i just havent gotten many comedies she said im a sucker 
for the powerful story i could do the easy thing and not have to go 
and kill myself each time i dont know why i do but its the way i

elane sollins last wish was to have her ashes 
scattered where her favorite baseball player could be found on 
third base at baltimores memorial stadium 
sollins was an avid fan of the baltimore orioles especially 
former third baseman brooks robinson she went to about 20 games a 
year where her favorite seat was along the thirdbase line and she 
listened to the rest of the games on the radio or television 
since sollins died oct 25 at 63 her son has been pursuing her 
wish 
shes been saying that for 2030 years whenever brooks 
robinson started playing said her son charles kalus she was a 
big orioles fan for years and third base is where her darling 
brooksie played i know its an odd request i know its nutty but 
odder requests have been made 
robinson said he didnt know sollins 
ive heard a lot of them but this is a new one he said 
im flattered i didnt realize how involved fans got with players 
until i got out of the game 
john aymold who works for the loringbyers funeral home wrote 
to the citys director of parks and recreation for approval if he 
goes along the decision rests with the team 
if theres any way to honor it were going to try kalus 
said before she died she went straight to the orioles with her 
request and was turned down i understand that but i just told her 
i would take it from there 
larry lucchino acting president of the orioles said he was 
staggered by the request but said the team would be willing to talk 
to the city and family about it 
if the request is denied kalus said he might take matters into 
his own hands 
ill show up at the stadium and talk to them myself he said 
i might even call brooks to see if he has any pull and theres 
always camera day when fans are allowed on the field

a 24yearold american convicted on 
cocaine trafficking charges by a spanish court despite attempts by 
former us attorney general edwin meese to have him freed left 
today for the united states 
conan owen 24 of annandale va was sentenced to six years in 
prison in april after being convicted of bringing four pounds of 
cocaine into spain from chile in a falsebottomed suitcase 
but once in the united states justice department officials could 
decide to grant owen immediate parole because they believe he is 
innocent 
owen has consistently denied any knowledge of the cocaine in the 
suitcase a claim corroborated in a court deposition by a washington 
dc man for whom owen was working as a freelance photographer at 
the time of his arrest 
to obtain the transfer to the united states owen had to agree 
not to appeal his conviction he returns home under a 1983 treaty 
signed by madrid and washington that permits convicts to serve out 
their sentences in prisons in their home country 
the spanish government agreed to his request for a transfer 
during a weekly cabinet meeting oct 28 
accompanied by two us marshals owen boarded twa flight 903 
which left barcelona for new york with a stopover in madrid he left 
prison sunday in a police van and spent the night at barcelona 
police headquarters 
owen who worked as a 1984 summer intern in vice president bushs 
office and had been admitted to the us army intelligence school at 
fort huachuca ariz was arrested march 13 1987 on his arrival in 
barcelona from santiago chile 
in chile owen said he had been shooting travel brochure photos 
on an assignment arranged by washington dc resident jorge barahona 
in return for a suspended sentence on a felony cocaine charge and 
a promise from us officials that he would not be extradited to 
spain barahona told a us federal judge that owen knew nothing 
about the drugs and had been set up to carry the suitcase 
his declarations also led to the indictment in virginia of three 
others in the plot all three are at large 
but the barcelona court that tried owen refused to admit 
barahonas deposition as evidence because pleabargaining is illegal 
in spain 
when meese traveled to madrid in february to sign a protocol for 
an extradition treaty with thenjustice minister fernando ledesma 
he told reporters he was handing over barahonas deposition to 
ledesma in hopes the charges against owen would be dropped 
after owens conviction meese said through a justice department 
spokesman that he regrets very much this action by the spanish 
court i think its important to stress that we continue to 
believe in mr owens innocence and we continue to hope that he 
will ultimately be exonerated

troops backed by helicopters and 
armored cars stormed a prison and killed 12 inmates today in 
crushing a rebellion by 1500 convicts authorities said 
about 25 prisoners were injured in the assault by troops who 
threw tear gas and opened fire as two helicopters hovered over the 
mediumsecurity welikade prison in suburban colombo police said 
soldiers stood guard and smoke could still be seen more than two 
hours after the uprising was quashed at the prison which generally 
houses inmates awaiting trial on criminal rather than political or 
civil charges 
among the injured was a former navy sailor convicted of attempted 
murder for clubbing prime minister rajiv gandhi of india with a 
rifle butt two years ago police said 
half the prison population of 3000 broke out of their cells 
sunday and staged a sitin to demand better food the resignation of 
president junius r jayewardene and the dissolution of parliament 
officials said 
the inmates took one guard hostage but released him early today 
police said speaking on condition of anonymity 
they then set fire to furniture in four buildings behind the 
20foot walls around the prison complex and cut telephone lines the 
police said 
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the prison 
rebellion apparently was inspired by strikes and demonstrations 
being organized around the country by a radical sinhalese group the 
peoples liberation front 
the front has accused jayewardene a sinhalese of making too 
many concessions to minority tamils seeking autonomy 
in southern sri lanka at least 153 prisoners tunneled out of a 
military detention camp sunday but 78 of them were recaptured the 
government 
almost all the escapees from the pelawatte camp had been detained 
on suspicion of belonging to the peoples liberation front blamed 
by authorities for more than 500 killings in the past 15 months the 
camp is 30 miles southeast of colombo 
the front opposes the governments peace overtures for ending a 
fiveyearold tamil guerrilla war tamils who make up about 18 
percent of sri lankas 16 million people want an independent 
homeland in the northeastern sri lanka they claim they are 
discriminated against by sinhalese who comprise 75 percent of the 
people 
in another prison protest sunday about 800 inmates in kandy 60 
miles east of colombo staged a clamorous demonstration from their 
cells about 35 of them sat on the roof of bogambara prison waving 
red flags and demanding jayewardenes resignation 
the president has already said he plans to retire after new 
presidential elections scheduled for dec 19 
the injured inmates at welikade prison included wijemuni vijitha 
rohana who attacked gandhi on july 30 1987 one day after gandhi 
and jayewardene signed a peace accord designed to end a guerrilla 
war by sri lankas tamil minority 
rohana a 23yearold sinhalese was listed in serious condition 
police said 
rohana was a member of a military honor guard that gandhi was 
inspecting when the sailor swung his rifle and landed a glancing 
blow on the prime ministers shoulder in november 1987 a military 
court convicted rohana of attempted murder and sentenced him to six 
years in prison rohana has appealed

rightwing prime minister yitzhak shamir may pay 
a high price for forming israels next government if he drives a 
wedge between the jewish state and the international jewish 
community in the process 
shamirs likud bloc is using a package of religious laws opposed 
by many jews outside israel as a bargaining chip to coax the 
religious parties into a likudled coalition 
jewish organizations overseas particularly fear passage of laws 
that enhance the power of israels orthodox jews thus devaluing the 
conservative and reform streams of judaism to which many jews abroad 
belong 
this is a red line said harry wall head of the israeli 
office of the usbased antidefamation league of bnai brith 
this could do serious damage to the concept of jewish unity and 
common destiny and weaken the ability of american jews to identify 
with israel 
likud won 40 parliament seats in tuesdays elections more than 
the 39 seats won by the leftleaning labor party but not enough to 
form a government without the support of four small religious 
parties which together hold 18 seats 
passing religious legislation could undermine the american jewish 
communitys political and moral support for israel and threaten the 
halfbillion dollars israel gets in annual contributions from 
american jewry 
one of the ripple effects could be to diminish the power of the 
proisraeli lobby in the united states which has a tremendous 
influence over us foreign policy the united states gives israel 
3 billion in aid each year 
at the heart of the controversy is the socalled who is a jew 
law the law that defines who is jewish and thus eligible for 
automatic israeli citizenship 
at present the law says a jew is anyone whose mother is jewish 
or who converted to the faith 
but orthodox jews say this is not enough they want to amend the 
law so that only conversions performed by an orthodox rabbi will 
count 
only 10 to 15 percent of the united states 55 million jews are 
orthodox for the others although the number of converts among 
them may be small and the number who plan to live in israel marginal 
a change in the law would cast doubt on their jewishness 
the american jewish community is going to support israel 
regardless of israeli policy on almost any issue said shlomo 
avineri a political scientist at the hebrew university in 
jerusalem there is only one reservation and that is the 
whoisajew legislation 
jewish groups in the united states and worldwide are mobilizing 
their forces to fight the amendment 
representatives of organizations and private individuals have 
flooded israeli consulates and embassies with telegrams and phone 
calls opposing the change said rabbi richard hirsch executive 
director of the world union for progressive reform judaism 
its been a spontaneous reaction he said whoisajew has 
become a symbol of what the relationship is between the state of 
israel and the jewish nation 
the north american coalition on the whos a jew question an 
umbrella group formed last year before a previous attempt to change 
the law failed voted unanimously friday to fight the amendment 
said stephen donshik director of the israeli office of the council 
of jewish federations 
he said the coalition communicated its concern to israeli 
political parties even before last weeks elections and will repeat 
its message through telegrams letters and possibly newspaper 
advertisements 
the state of israel is a mutual identification point for jews 
all around the world donshik said this should not be a 
political issue

a titan 34d rocket 
thundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend and one 
expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication 
satellites into orbit 
the 16storytall booster blasted off sunday morning said air 
force capt john sullivan a spokesman for the sprawling vandenberg 
military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of los angeles 
as usual for military space flights the air force didnt 
announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload 
however it most likely carried two satellite data system 
satellites although it also might have carried either a kh9 or 
kh11 photo reconnaissance satellite said john pike a space policy 
expert for the washingtonbased federation of american scientists 
pike who knew about the launch in advance said friday the data 
system satellites are used for military communications 
the satellites provide a way for the president to stay in touch 
with our nuclear forces to give bombers and silobased crews 
operating missiles the go code to launch nuclear warheads he 
said 
pike said two sds satellites were launched five years ago 
theyre due for replacement 
sds and khseries satellites are the only types launched from 
vandenberg on titan 34ds he said 
the reason i think its sds is i dont think the air force has 
any more kh9s or kh11s pike said 
the titan 34d americas most powerful space booster will be 
supplanted by the titan 4 due for its maiden launch next year from 
cape canaveral fla 
the last launch of a titan 34d was from cape canaveral on sept 
2 but sources told the associated press it failed to place its 
payload in orbit 
pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor 
soviet missile tests and radio telephone radar and other 
electronic communications 
two titan 34ds were launched successfully in late 1987 before 
then they were grounded following two straight explosions during 
launches on aug 28 1985 and april 18 1986 destroying a kh11 
and a kh9

a palestinian day laborer today stabbed to death 
a soldier guarding a jewish settlement in the west bank and then 
the assailant was killed by an israeli farmer witnesses said 
the soldier was killed at about 9 am while guarding the gate to 
the massua cooperative farm 26 miles northeast of jerusalem said 
yuval yedidia head of the cooperative 
the arab worker approached the gate on foot yedidia said when 
the guard demanded an entry permit the assailant attacked the 
guard with a knife and stabbed him about 30 times yedidia said 
one of the farms residents heard shouts he grabbed a gun and 
they the soldier and the assailant were still entangled when he 
arrived he opened fire yedidia said 
the palestinian was among about 100 seasonal laborers working in 
grapevines pepperfields and flowerbeds residents said 
the cooperative was closed off by soldiers after the attack and 
defense minister yitzhak rabin and lt gen dan shomron army chief 
of staff came to the farm 
yedidia described relations between arabs and jews in the 
cooperative as generally good but said members had expressed 
concern about palestinians working in their midst he said farmers 
or soldiers routinely guard the cooperative 
todays deaths brought the palestinian death toll to 308 since 
the dec 8 start of the uprising against israeli occupation of the 
west bank and gaza strip the guard became the 11th israeli and 
second soldier to be killed 
in the west bank city of nablus four palestinians were wounded 
today when troops opened fire to disperse a demonstration protesting 
the armys closure of west bank schools arab hospital officials 
said 
some demonstrators carried outlawed palestinian flags and others 
chanted open our schools immediately and freedom for our 
students 
west bank schools have been closed for most of the uprising army 
officials argue that schools are hotbets of antiisraeli violence 
a fifth palestinian a 14yearold boy was wounded in a clash 
with troops in gaza city hospital officials said 
also today the rightwing likud bloc and the leftofcenter 
labor party held talks with smaller parties for a chance to form the 
next coalition govermment after tuesdays inconclusive elections 
attacks on israelis generally boost hardline sentiments and an 
west bank firebomb attack oct 30 is believed to have cost labor a 
crucial three seats in the 120member parliament 
a mother and her four young sons were burned to death in the 
assault on a bus north of jericho 
likud the largest party seemed to have the best chance of 
putting together a rightist coalition with the support of four 
orthodox parties 
likud won 40 seats in the 120member parliament and labor won 39 
but the left wing parties together have 49 seats to the rights 47 
labors chances improved sunday after two ultraorthodox groups 
shas and the torah flag party announced they were considering 
joining a laborled government 
another prospect of labor participation was a joint government 
with likud like the one formed after 1984 elections ended in 
stalemate labor party leader shimon peres is under some pressure to 
join with likud and avoid concessions that would curtail the freedom 
of israels secular majority 
the hadashot newspaper said over the weekend that likud leader 
and prime minister yitzhak shamir would be willing to discuss such a 
coalition on condition he remain prime minister with rabin a 
laborite staying on as defense minister 
rabin who has had a longrunning feud with peres and is a rival 
for the labor leadership post told israel television saturday he 
didnt rule out a joint government with likud

iowa it was here last winter that george bush took a humbling at 
the hands of pat robertson and bob dole when he lost a republican 
straw poll he mused that his supporters might have been attending 
air shows or debutante parties michael dukakis is flying in for a 
predawn rally in des moines on election day to nail down a victory 
nonetheless iowa is a republican state and youd have to see it to 
believe it would go to the democrat 
texas lloyd bentsen was supposed to give dukakis a foot in the 
door of this pivotal state but texans can vote bentsen for senate 
and still vote for the other homestate candidate houston 
hotelsuite occupant bush without texas dukakis realistically 
needs to sweep california michigan ohio and illinois or he goes 
home to be governor a pretty tall order michigan and ohio both 
voted democratic exactly once since 1936 
ohio is there somewhere in ohio a street corner that a prominent 
republican hasnt visited they call it carpetbombing gop leaders 
from ronald reagan on down have come in to erect a firewall in 
ohio in case dukakis wins texas 
maryland a guncontrol measure may increase conservative turnout 
and deliver this democratic state to bush in which case look for 
the gop to put a gun issue on every ballot in every state every year 
forever 
south dakota a republican loyalist from castlewood was saying 
recently she thought this might be a democratic year it would be 
the first one since landslide lyndon won almost everything in 1964 
illinois for dukakis to win in illinois he needs a big turnout 
and a big margin from chicago black voters but some pundits believe 
disinterest in this key constituency may play to bushs advantage 
here and elsewhere 
california may have the best presidential race in the nation 
but the state is so big and the ballot is so complicated that any 
reasonable person has lost interest

one player matched all six numbers to win a 38 
million lotto jackpot but the identity of the lucky ticketholder 
remains a mystery lottery officials say 
the player who won the grand prize after a week of 
recordbreaking ticket sales will receive the states second 
largest jackpot in annual payments over the next 20 years said 
sharon sharp director of the illinois lottery 
in the hour before the 7 pm drawing saturday the states 4100 
machines processed a record 26000 tickets per minute and sales 
topped 11 million an hour said lottery spokeswoman kathy rem 
ticket sales totaled 267 million for the week including 115 
million on saturday alone ms sharp said sunday 
lottery officials were expected to announce the total prize at 
least 38 million today ms rem said but she said it was 
unlikely the winnings would top the 40 million prize won in 1984 by 
chicago printer mike wittkowski 
the prize grew as no one matched all the lotto numbers for three 
consecutive weeks 
to win players must match the six numbers between one and 54 
lesser prizes go to players who match four and five of the six 
winning numbers the winning numbers were 33 35 43 44 45 and 52

all but one of the forest 
fires that plagued yellowstone national park this summer have been 
declared under control thanks to early snowfall 
fire managers will watch the smoldering leftovers of the fires 
until the last puff of smoke dies away said park spokeswoman amy 
vanderbilt 
only the clovermist blaze whic burned in yellowstone and the 
adjacent shoshone national forest has yet to be declared 
controlled vanderbilt said sunday 
wintry weather late last week helped get the north fork wolf 
lake and snake complex of fires under control she added 
the snow also forced park officials sunday to close yellowstones 
south and east entrances probably until spring the west and north 
entrances remain open 
officials have estimated that about 20 percent of the 11 million 
acres the fires surrounded were charred in the 22 millionacre park 
snow depths in the park sunday ranged from an inch or less to as 
much as a foot 
active firefighting ended some weeks ago but officials have 
continued to keep a close eye on the fires 
as of saturday there were still 41 people and one helicopter 
monitoring and doing rehabilitation work on the north fork fire in 
the area of the old faithful geyser while 173 people and three 
helicopters monitor the adjacent wolf lake fire according to 
vanderbilt four people were monitoring the snake complex in the 
parks southern section 
thats primarily rehabilitation crews and some of that work is 
ongoing as long as weather permits she said

and fiji islands in the south pacific today seismologists reported 
there were no reports of casualties or damage from the quakes 
each of which measured 69 on the richter scale according to the 
seismological observatory in canberra and the us geological survey 
in golden colo 
the epicenter of the fiji quake was in the sea about 250 miles 
south of the islands said an official at the canberra observatory 
he gave no time for the quake 
an earthquake struck vanuatu about 700 miles west of fiji at 
350 pm local time today according to seismologists in golden who 
registered the movement vanuatu is 1100 miles north of auckland 
new zealand

republican george bush in a frenzied campaign 
swing aimed at bolstering his lead over democratic rival michael 
dukakis declared today he was winding up his marathon race for the 
presidency not in a power walk but in a sprint 
the vice president began lastday sweep through four states by 
urging his rally audience in the detroit suburb of southfield to 
vote in tuesdays election and when they go to the polls he said 
they should ask themselves is the country headed in the right 
direction 
added bush the answer is yes it is 
the gop nominee took what appeared to be a veiled swipe at 
dukakis penchant for getting exercise by speed walking with weights 
in each hand 
in a sense michigan is where we got our real start this 
year bush said and in a sense its a very important place to 
be as we run right down to the finish line not in a power walk but 
in a sprint 
the close contest in michigan could be the key to this whole 
election he said referring to the importance of the big 
voteheavy industrial states of the middle west 
michigan was the first battleground in the race for the 
republican nomination and it was there that bush got his start by 
beating pat robertson and rep jack kemp of new york 
on tuesday bush sought to counter criticism that he had set the 
negative tone of the 1988 presidential campaign 
i am getting sick and tired of my opponents complaining about 
the rough and tumble of this campaign something he does every time 
just before an election bush told a rally sunday in the san 
fernando valley of los angeles 
he seems to forget the past he seems to forget those personal 
attacks night after night on me on my character at that idiotic 
democratic convention 
the vice president said voters can see through the smoke 
screen and that all thats left is this daily whining about a 
negative campaign 
my advice to the liberal governor of massachusetts is look 
my friend if you cant stand the heat get the hell out of the 
kitchen bush later told an outdoor rally in covina calif 
after a day of courting voters in colorado and california bush 
tried to put michigan firmly into his pocket and then headed for 
missouri and ohio two other states where the race is close before 
spending tonight and election day in houston 
tonight bush was making his final appeal to voters nationwide in 
a paid halfhour broadcast on the cbs nbc and abc networks 
campaign officials said sunday that their tracking polls showed 
slippage in bushs support last week had subsided 
but other polls for news organizations over the weekend showed 
some volatility with democratic rival michael dukakis gaining a 
little ground 
national polls released sunday showed bush ahead by margins 
ranging from five to 12 points surveys of the 50 states indicated 
however with indications that the gop nominee has more than enough 
states firmly in his column to garner the 270 electoral college 
votes needed for victory 
campaign manager lee atwater told reporters bush forces believe a 
republican victory in either ohio michigan or missouri would 
foreclose any chance dukakis might have of putting together a 
combination that adds up to 270 electoral votes 
california where bush spent sunday seeking the nations biggest 
electoral prize of 47 votes was considered a tossup in the final 
weekend before election day in the gop campaigns own polls bush 
aides said 
we feel good with our electoral strength we have in both our 
strong states and those that are leaning to us campaign chief of 
staff craig fuller said of the republican nominees own polling 
figures 
sundays theme from bush and his surrogates was dukakis 
complaints about the bush campaign attacks 
atwater called the dukakis criticism hypocritical because he 
claimed the democrats started the campaign attacks when they 
derided bush at their atlanta convention this summer he called the 
convention a threeday mudslinging festival 
those comments and similar themes voiced by other campaign 
spokesmen came on a day when the new york times published a poll 
showing most respondents blamed bush principally for the negative 
tone of race 
while blasting dukakis for attacking his attacks bush kept up 
the offensive he is naive he is totally inexperienced in foreign 
policy bush said of his opponent 
atwater said one of the campaigns biggest concerns was getting 
out the vote a theme bush has raised continually in the past week 
in urging republican voters against complacency 
i never felt better or stronger or more ready to fight for 
every vote out there the vice president said at the san fernando 
valley rally 
bush aides meantime looked beyond election day to what an 
electoral landslide could mean to the republican as president 
anything we can do to enhance george bushs electoral strength 
by harnessing our resources should increase george bushs 
electoral lead and strengthen his hand as president said fuller

students at spelman college a black womens 
school should take the fruits of their education back to their 
communities and help the poor the schools new president said at 
her inauguration 
if we do nothing to improve our world then we cannot call 
ourselves educated women johnetta b cole said sunday how can 
we call ourselves either educated or leaders if we turn away from 
the very reality that a third of black america lives in poverty 
we must build sturdy black bridges into the very communities 
from which we have come for if we do not build those bridges then 
we will surely drown in our own selfishness 
ms cole first black woman president of the 107yearold liberal 
arts college was inaugurated sunday although she has been at the 
school since july 1987 her speech wrapped up a weekend that 
included the announcement of a 20 million gift to the school from 
entertainer bill cosby

hit tv series the cosby show have been filmed there 
the donation will be used mostly to construct an academic center 
which will double the colleges classroom space about 8 million 
will go to spelmans endowment currently at 42 million

about 600 people were killed or injured by an 
earthquake that shook a remote mountain jungle region of southern 
china the staterun china international broadcasting station said 
today 
the station said it did not have a breakdown on how many of the 
600 were dead and how many injured in sundays quake 
the radio report could not immediately be confirmed 
independently the state seismology bureau in beijing which earlier 
reported 18 dead and 54 injured said it had no new information 
the highest previous count was from the official xinhua news 
agency which reported at least 37 deaths and said more than 100 
people were injured telephone service was cut off to the affected 
region in yunnan province near the burmese border 
the quake measured 76 on the richter scale and was followed 
overnight and early today by 34 aftershocks the strongest measuring 
72 on the richter scale 
roads to the affected area were impassable and yunnan authorities 
ordered an airlift of food medicine and other relief supplies 
yunnan gov he zhiqiang flew to the scene to direct rescue work 
xinhua said most houses were destroyed in lancang and menglian 
counties which were at the epicenter of the quake the population 
of the counties was not immediately available but officials said 
the area is sparsely inhabited 
buildings also were destroyed in 14 surrounding counties xinhua 
said most homes in that part of china are simple mud and wood 
structures 
crews were working to repair roads and radio contact was 
established xinhua said 
lancang is home to the lahu minority group and the va minority 
group also lives in the region 
there are about 300000 lahu people most of them in yunnan 
province they are related to tibetans and burmans and practice 
buddhism the va people number about 260000 speak a language of 
the monkhmer branch and are buddhists both groups are primarily 
farmers 
at about the same time as the first quake in china a less 
powerful temblor was reported in northern thailand near the burmese 
border the quake caused minor damage to buildings and made 
highrise buildings sway in bangkok hundreds of miles to the south 
in the skylounge restaurant on the top floor of the 43story 
baiyoke tower bangkoks tallest building hundreds of panicked 
patrons fled without paying their bills 
the quake in china was also felt in yunnans capital kunming 
240 miles northeast of lancang a city of 15 million residents the 
seismology bureau said there was no damage there 
a quake measuring 50 on the richter scale hit the lancang region 
oct 15 but there were no reports of casualties 
the yunnan quake was the second in china during the weekend 
on saturday a quake measuring 70 on the richter scale shook 
northern tibet and qinghai province in far western china qinghai 
seismology officials said the epicenter was in an uninhabited area 
of the tanggula mountains and there were no reports of casualties 
earthquakes occur frequently both in the tanggula mountains and 
the series of mountain chains that stretch along chinas southern 
border however quakes measuring 7 or more on the richter scale are 
rare 
the richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an 
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a 
seismograph a quake measuring 7 is capable of causing heavy damage 
in a populated area while one measuring 8 is 10 times as strong and 
capable of tremendous damage 
china is one of the most earthquakeprone countries in the world 
and seismology officials predicted in 1985 that quake activity would 
increase through the end of the century 
the last major quake was on aug 23 1985 when a temblor 
measuring 74 on the richter scale killed 71 people and injured 125 
in the far western xinjiang uygur autonomous region 
chinas worst earthquake in modern times was the temblor 
measuring 78 that leveled the northeastern industrial city of 
tangshan on july 28 1976 killing at 242000 people by official 
count 
the worlds most deadly earthquake ever was a jan 24 1556 
temblor in northcentral china that killed 830000 people

tens of thousands of civil servants in government 
offices ports and prisons went on strike today to protest the 
firing of union workers at britains intelligencegathering 
headquarters 
a spokesman for the council of civil service unions an umbrella 
body for britains eight civil service unions estimated 200000 
workers took part in the oneday walkout 
dozens of lunchtime rallies were held to protest the recent 
firings of five men at the government communications headquarters in 
cheltenham the huge southwest england facility eavesdrops on the 
soviet union and the government maintains its work is too sensitive 
to risk disruption by strikes 
the firings provoked new charges that prime minister margaret 
thatchers government is undermining civil liberties 
the union coalition reported 80 percentplus walkouts had 
shut down many employment and welfare offices staterun job and 
drivingtest centers across britain 
civil servants also walked off jobs in customs offices prisons 
airports and magistrates courts it said 
were thinking 200000 is not a bad estimate said 
spokeswoman anne kenefeck 
the five men have been fired for defying a 1984 ban on unions at 
the facility and another 12 men are facing retirement compulsory 
transfer or dismissal they are the holdouts from among onethird of 
the 7000 employees at the facility who were union members in 1984 
at the time most accepted about 1400 in compensation to quit 
their union 
critics see the firings as the latest occasion on which the 
thatcher government has chosen to sacrifice an element of individual 
freedom for what it calls the national interest 
the present dispute is one aspect of a much larger debate 
says donald cameron watt a professor of international history at 
the london school of economics its become a party policy issue 
over the issue of openness of information the reform of secrecy 
laws 
the firings follow two highly controversial clampdowns in 
october the government banned broadcast interviews with members of 
the irish republican army and 10 other militant northern ireland 
groups and announced plans to remove any suspects right to remain 
silent under police questioning 
at cheltenham the unions have lost a string of legal battles and 
have no chance of overturning the ban but refuse to back down 
none of the holdouts had been fired until this year although 
union officials say the government tried to freeze them out with 
tactics such as refusing them pay raises 
mike grindley a chineselanguage expert estimates he lost 5000 
to 6000 pounds 8850 to 10000 in raises before being fired in 
october he now works full time on the campaign 
we dont think about the money too much grindley 51 said 
in a telephone interview it hasnt been easy but theres been 
compensation you can hold your head up high 
in imposing the ban mrs thatcher cited pay strikes in 197981 
that disrupted work at cheltenham the european center of soviet 
eavesdropping for nato 
the headquarters intercepts radio signals and other 
communications from the soviet union and its east bloc allies 
the facility attracted international attention in 1982 when 
geoffrey prime a translator in russian at the facility was 
uncovered as a soviet agent prime described as one of the wests 
most damaging postworld war ii traitors was sentenced to 35 years 
in prison 
you can make quite a strong case on the government point 
said professor watt who also is a member of the editorial board of 
the journal of intelligence and national security 
the government believed they had a case it wasnt just 
unionbashing he added in an interview they operate on a 
worstcase analysis and strikes were something they had very good 
reason to think would happen 
the unions reply that strikes never affected security and that 
the government rejected a 1984 offer of a nostrike deal 
some thatcher supporters have expressed unease at the 
governments refusal to compromise in the cheltenham dispute 
commentator nicholas comfort writing in the proconservative 
party daily telegraph newspaper on the growing power of the state 
over the individual said the government could have reached a 
nostrike agreement if it had tried 
it is not just the threat of terrorism which has brought fresh 
intervention into our daily lives comfort added

george bush is mounting a lastminute 
television attack on michael dukakis with a fierce fiveminute ad 
criticizing the massachusetts governor on his handling of everything 
from crime to the environment 
the bush ad coming amid a flurry of upbeat musical commercials 
and tonights relatively tame 30minute network appeals summarizes 
the attacks republican bush has been making against his democratic 
opponent in ads and on the stump throughout the election season 
its running in selected markets its a broad overview of 
everything that michael dukakis stands for according to his 
record bush ad director sig rogich said today rogich denied the 
ad was introduced in response to narrowing poll margins he said it 
had been planned long ago and was in the works for weeks 
literally 
the fiveminute ad features massachusetts residents and officials 
complaining about dukakis handling of pollution in boston harbor 
the states prisoner furlough program and the states economy 
including taxes jobs and budget shortfalls bush does not appear 
in addition to eleventhhour attack ads tv viewers also are 
being treated to sentimental media closings featuring flags 
children and old people 
the doublebarrelled multimillion dollar windup concludes a 
campaign season shaped to an unprecedented degree by television 
from 10second sound bites and 30second ads to extended interviews 
the finale comes tonight when each candidate airs 30minute appeals 
on the three networks at a cost of 1 million for each campaign 
even the ads acknowledge tvs pervasive presence bushs musical 
spot features several scenes of people watching him on their tv 
sets dukakis is shown in one of his spots watching a bush attack ad 
and switching off the set in disgust 
the fall campaigns began with madefortv conventions awash in 
flags balloons children and teleprompters the halls carefully 
refashioned with seating podiums and colors suitable for the small 
screen 
the dukakis program at 8 pm est showcases the massachusetts 
governor answering questions in a town meeting setting and contains 
footage of his family and his running mate texas sen lloyd 
bentsen during the program dukakis urges americans to look in 
the mirror and ask yourself is george bush on your side i want to 
give every american a chance to build a better life 
the bush effort at 830 pm est summarizes the vice presidents 
resume beliefs and plans for the nation 
the two candidates set records this year for money spent on 
commercials expected to top 30 million apiece and for free air 
time on news talk and interview shows at all hours of day and 
night 
some say the campaigns also set a record for negative 
advertising but while a mixture of ads remained on the air to the 
end the mood of some of the newer spots was uplifting 
rogich and jim weller part of the team that brought viewers the 
morning in america ads of president reagans 1984 campaign 
evoke the same mood for the vice president with the same song 
god bless the usa a patriotic country ballad sung by lee 
greenwood 
there are the tvwatching scenes a grandmother and grandchild 
several pledges of allegiance bush with world leaders and bush with 
children dressed up as pilgrims for a play sings greenwood if 
tomorrow all the things were gone i worked for all my life id 
thank my lucky stars to be living here today cause the flag still 
stands for freedom and they cant take that away 
the lyrics in dukakis anthem commercial reflect the 
democrats more complicated task of promising a better future 
without badmouthing the present the time is soon the singers 
say as a young mother caresses a babys face a bright future is 
what were going to see we keep reaching out for better and we will 
never say never because we know where we come from the best america 
is yet to come 
the most memorable commercials of the campaign were less upbeat 
revolving door a bush spot showed a procession of inmates 
filing in and out of a revolving iron gate then an ominous aerial 
view of prison grounds and a guard tower the narrator says dukakis 
vetoed the death penalty and gave weekend furloughs to 
firstdegree murderers not eligible for parole while out many 
committed other crimes like kidnapping and rape and many are still 
at large 
dukakis struck back belatedly first with a packaging of 
george bush series that struck a raw nerve among consultants and 
columnists too confusing too elitist they said of the spots 
which showed actors playing cynical bush handlers trying to disguise 
their candidates alleged shortcomings 
bush mocked dukakis tank ride and derided his defense positions 
dukakis castigated bushs choice of running mate dan quayle and 
denounced bushs performance as head of antiterrorism and drug task 
forces dukakis is on your side his campaign ads pledged 
america cant afford that risk bushs ads retorted 
did any of it matter yes according to early indications 
in a 1984 postelection poll of registered voters 12 percent 
said commercials had helped them decide how to vote asked the same 
question in a cbsnew york times poll late last month 25 percent of 
probable voters admitted their decision was influenced by 
commercials

two officers have been suspended after the killing 
of an unarmed prisoner who was shot when he freed himself from 
handcuffs and tried to escape authorities said 
the officers fired at least 12 shots said harris county 
sheriffs lt ruben diaz 
roland brothers jr 28 of lafayette la was struck by at 
least three bullets two in the chest the county medical examiners 
office said sunday 
some witnesses told reporters that the officers continued 
shooting after brothers fell but chief deputy sheriff tommy thomas 
said sunday that they refused to talk to investigators and that 
other witnesses had disputed their reports 
they didnt have to keep shooting that man said witness 
elaine white she told reporters that after the man was shot in the 
leg and in the torso he said hey man im not going anywhere 
brothers wanted on a felony escape and several other warrants 
was booked by police saturday in suburban jersey village for 
unauthorized use of a vehicle and then turned over to sheriffs 
detectives barry rizk and robert nichols diaz said 
brothers whose record included four harris county escape charges 
and one louisiana escape was handcuffed and immobilized by a leg 
brace during the drive to the county jail diaz said 
but brothers managed to remove the leg brace and free his right 
hand from the cuffs and when the two detectives stopped the car in 
the harris county jail garage he left their car and started 
running authorities said the detectives shouted for him to stop 
diaz said 
brothers initially identified as michael reed an alias ran 
toward the jails garage door which was closing 
both detectives knew they could not reach reed brothers 
before the door closed he would have been outside they were 
inside diaz said 
the officers then fired about 12 shots and brothers fell outside 
the door 
the number of times he was shot is immaterial said district 
attorney john b holmes jr the investigation is whether he was 
escaping i dont see there appears to be much doubt to that 
holmes said state law allows use of deadly force to prevent an 
escape 
a handcuff key was found in brothers underwear at the medical 
examiners office diaz said 
rizk 29 and nichols 34 were relieved of duty with pay pending 
an investigation by the sheriffs homicide and internal affairs 
divisions and the district attorneys office

the case of an elderly couple suing their 
son in an effort to regain ownership of their own home is not as 
unusual as it might sound say advocates for the elderly 
hyman freeman a retired fruit seller and his wife frances 
were persuaded two years ago by their 52yearold son leonard to 
put their house in his name to save money on inheritance taxes 
according to the elder freemans who are in their late 70s the 
agreement was that their son would be responsible for upkeep of the 
house while his parents lived there on a 25year lease under the 
arrangement if the parents wanted to they could cancel it and take 
the house back in their name they said 
but the freemans say their son didnt keep his word so this 
summer they filed suit accusing him of defrauding them of their 
home they want the property back and without the 100000 mortgage 
they say their son took out on the house to get a line of credit 
the boston sunday globe reported 
said mrs freeman we havent slept nights its pretty 
tough when your son does that to you and after youve been so good 
to him 
the son a musician and court officer in boston land court has 
declined comment and his lawyer paul driscoll said i want to 
try my cases in court and not in the arena of public opinion 
if you were in litigation with your father would you want it 
in the newspaper he told the globe 
such cases are not unusual say advocates for senior citizens 
ellen bruce managing attorney for greater boston elderly legal 
services said her office handles five or six cases per year of 
people who say they were induced to give their homes to younger 
family members 
its done much too often without seniors getting proper legal 
advice ms bruce said they trust their children 
the elder freeman said he agreed to the arrangement but made it 
clear to his son that the house was only to be in the sons name 
the two sides are scheduled to meet in court in january

creative nonviolence ccnv and its founder mitch snyder who seek 
exclusive copyright ownership of the work 
ccnv which is based in the nations capital decided in 1985 to 
participate in the annual christmas pageant of peace here by 
sponsoring a display dramatizing the plight of the homeless 
snyder and other ccnv members commissioned james earl reid a 
baltimore md sculptor to create a work entitled third world 
america 
using a synthetic substance called design cast 62 that would be 
tinted to resemble bronze reid agreed to sculpt two adult figures 
and a child huddled on a streetside steam grate 
the lifesized figures were intended to be part of an updated 
nativity scene 
ccnv provided a steam grate and pedestal for the work 
reid was paid 15000 for expenses and for his assistants he 
donated his own services without charge 
ccnv sent the entire sculpture back to reid in january 1986 for 
some repairs 
the group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of several 
cities to raise money for the homeless 
but reid objected to the tour because he said the sculpture was 
too fragile he urged ccnv to cast the work in bronze or make a 
master mold that would withstand the tour 
ccnv declined but said reid could do so if he wished 
two months later reid refused to return the sculpture and 
registered it in his own name he also said he planned to take the 
work on a less ambitious exhibition tour 
ccnv then filed a lawsuit claiming exclusive copyright ownership 
of the sculpture 
a federal judge ruled in favor of the organization on grounds the 
sculpture was a work made for hire whose copyright is owned by 
ccnv 
but the us circuit court of appeals overturned the judges 
decision and ordered further hearings in the case 
the appeals court said the physical work itself is owned by ccnv 
but it said the organization may have to share with reid the 
copyright and any profits derived from the work and credit for its 
creation 
intense as ccnvs participation in the project may have been 
reid as sculptor contributed more than a minimal amount of 
creativity to third world america the appeals court said 
that is enough to render reid an author of a protected 
work under a 1976 revision of federal copyright law the appeals 
court said 
the only question left to be decided is whether ccnv and reid 
should share the copyright ownership the appeals court said as it 
sent the case back to a federal judge 
the copyright justice coalition representing more than 100000 
artists urged the supreme court to adopt the appeals courts 
interpretation of the 1976 copyright law 
it is critically important for freelance creators to be able 
to claim authorship of their own works in order to build a 
reputation that attracts new clients the coalition said 
equally as important freelance creators rely heavily on the 
incomeproducing potential associated with ownership of the 
copyrights in their works 
denying artists such protection will dry up our national 
resources of freelance creative talent the coalition added 
the case is community for creative nonviolence vs reid 88293

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by a 
company challenging federal guidelines for controlling and removing 
asbestos in school buildings 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
regulations are reasonable 
the national gypsum co a leading former producer of asbestos 
said guidelines adopted by the environmental protection agency are 
too vague give school officials too much discretion and lack 
scientific standards 
the company said the agency failed to carry out the mission 
assigned to it by a 1986 federal law that called for steps to 
protect the public against possible cancercausing exposure to 
asbestos 
rather than doing what congress had commanded epa simply 
repeated the vague generalities which had been the substance of its 
previous guidance and left it to local school authorities and 
selfinterested asbestos abatement consultants to select a response 
action which would presumably protect human health and the 
environment the company said 
the company could be hit with lawsuits seeking reimbursement by 
school districts for costly asbestos cleanup measures 
the us circuit court of appeals here ruled last may that the 
epa guidelines represent a reasonable interpretation of a law 
that is somewhat contradictory 
for example the appeals court said the agency properly decided 
that school officials could require removal of asbestos from 
buildings 
the appeals court also rejected the companys demand that the 
agency determine what levels of asbestos exposure are safe 
there is no agreement among scientists about how much exposure is 
hazardous the appeals court said 
asbestos historically was used widely in construction as a 
flame retardant for acoustical reasons as insulation for pipes and 
boilers and in ceiling and floor tiles 
national gypsum said that more than 100000 school buildings are 
affected by the epa guidelines 
the cost of compliance is estimated to be in excess of 3 
billion the company said and it could go far higher if the 
guidelines are extended to cover other buildings 
the reagan administration urging the supreme court to reject the 
companys appeal said national gypsum distorted the significance of 
the epa guidelines 
most of the cost associated with asbestos cleanup is for 
inspections and plans that schools must develop the justice 
department said and department lawyers said national gypsum is 
not challenging requirements that schools conduct inspections and 
develop plans for dealing with asbestos 
the case is national gypsum vs us environmental protection

michael dukakis raced from state to state 
the day before the presidential voting declaring the race was 
getting tighter and promising a comeback victory in a november 
surprise 
democrat dukakis pinning his hopes of overtaking george bush on 
more than two days of nonstop stumping spoke at sunrise to a 
boisterous crowd of several hundred supporters at a union hall in a 
cleveland suburb then flew to st louis 
he was greeted at the st louis airport by a band playing rock 
around the clock a fitting choice for his norest final effort 
they talk a lot about october surprises in an election 
campaign he told supporters tomorrow were going to have a 
november surprise 
the race is very very tight its getting tighter by the 
hour dukakis said 
he flew to brook park ohio on a redeye flight from 
spokane wash before heading to st louis and was flying west 
again for a full day of campaigning in california 
in all the trip to the midwest added to the schedule sunday 
had dukakis traveling more than 4000 miles in eight hours 
dukakis who caught a twohour nap on the flight east had more 
stops planned on another crosscountry flight early tuesday 
including a predawn rally in iowa on the last leg of a journey 
that would ultimately bring him home to boston to vote 
i dont need sleep im charging he said 
at the rally this morning held in a united auto workers union 
hall dukakis continued his attacks on bush and republican vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle and promised to be a president who 
stands up for american workers 
im not running for president to help the sharp operators on 
wall street dukakis said im running to help the lathe 
operators and the machine operators 
despite little sleep dukakis was in high spirits good 
morning ohio he declared at the opening of his speech we took 
the redeye to be with the buckeyes 
then acknowledging that he trails bush dukakis asked is ohio 
going to let the pollsters and the pundits decide this election or 
are you going to send a message to them 
later in the speech he said were going to win in ohio and 
all across this country 
as dukakis stumped sunday his focus was on his populist appeal 
and quayle the indiana senator and gop vice presidential nominee 
he scoffed at bush for borrowing the democrats im on your 
side line and said the vice president was so worried that his lead 
was eroding that he now was following dukakis around the country 
ill tell you one place hes not following mike dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen dukakis told crowds in westminster colo 
portland ore and the washington cities of tacoma and spokane 
hes not following us to 1600 pennsylvania avenue 
dukakis also pressed his contention that a man who would pick 
quayle to be a heartbeat away from the presidency lacks the judgment 
to be president honing the attack on a bush comment that he would 
consider putting quayle in charge of the white houses crisis 
management team 
dan quayle managing the cuban missile crisis think about it 
dukakis told about 20000 people at an outdoor rally at portland 
state university we cant afford to take that risk dan quayle 
isnt a crisis manager hes a crisis that has to be managed 
dukakis said bushs only new idea during the campaign has been a 
tax cut for the rich while the democrat listed his proposals on 
college financing health care a ban on offshore oil drilling in 
certain areas and his support for the equal rights amendment and 
comparable pay for women 
hes slipping and sliding were rocking and rolling an 
upbeat dukakis told his rallies americans all over the country 
are looking hard at this campaign and asking themselves the 
fundamental question which candidate will stand up for working 
families in this country 
dukakis took questions from students at the university of puget 
sound in tacoma wash sunday night and was asked whether he 
thought liberal had become a dirty word 
no i think mr bush is trying to make it a dirty word and i 
object to that the massachusetts governor said 
dukakis according to most national polls has cut into bushs 
lead but still faces a formidable task if he is to break the 
republicans apparent lock on the electoral college 
national polls released sunday showed bush ahead by margins 
ranging from five to 12 points but 50state surveys indicated that 
the gop nominee has more than enough states firmly in his column to 
garner the 270 electoral votes needed to elect 
according to aides dukakis is counting on winning california 
illinois michigan and pennsylvania all major states in which polls 
show a tight race his chances appear to hinge on beating bush in at 
least one of three other big states where he trails bush ohio new 
jersey and texas although dukakis aides insist there are other 
scenarios that could produce a dukakis win 
dukakis campaign vice chairman john sasso who has been directing 
the campaign from the road as he travels with dukakis told 
reporters sunday that polling in the past 24 hours showed movement 
toward dukakis among undecided voters and soft bush supporters 
he said bushs recent schedule changes to visit states shortly 
after dukakis showed the bush campaign was worried that dukakis was 
closing the gap 
i want to see if hes going to follow us now in the next 48 
hours sasso said after informing reporters of dukakis plans to 
campaign virtually without sleep from sunday through tuesday

an anonymous phone call led entertainer 
redd foxx to most of the jewelry stolen from his home in a 3 
million burglary including a halfpound gold watch given to him by 
elvis presley 
foxx said he received the call sunday afternoon at his home 
someone called and said if you want your stuff go to the fence 
and get it before someone else does foxx said my neighbor dan 
parker went outside and a garbage bag was hanging from the fence 
according to a police report the burglary occurred sometime 
between thursday when foxx who starred as junk dealer fred sanford 
on the television series sanford and son left the city and 
saturday when he returned 
jewelry furs and 107000 in cash was taken 
it has four lion heads on it with diamonds around the necks and 
was designed by elvis and engraved on the inside of it he said of 
the watch 
prince spencer foxxs manager said the burglars used an 
electric saw to get into the side entrance of the house 
they knew what they were doing because they cut through two 
entrances so that they could enter and exit without the alarm going 
off spencer said once they were inside they got through a 
sealed alarm closet and then they found a camouflaged safe and took 
the money out without a forced entry they bypassed all of the 
alarms in the house

the supreme court today let stand a ruling that 
barred television and still cameras and radio broadcasting equipment 
from a teamsters union embezzlement trial 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by media 
representatives in cleveland who said banning broadcast and 
photographic coverage of an important union corruption case violates 
the constitutions freepress guarantees 
the late union president jackie presser and two local teamsters 
officials in cleveland were indicted in 1986 on charges they 
violated a federal antiracketeering law by embezzling union funds 
the three were accused of keeping socalled ghost employees on 
the payroll of teamsters local 507 
presser who died in july of cardiac arrest before the trial 
began was an fbi informant who said he participated in the 
payrollpadding scheme with the bureaus approval 
the trial of the two others local 507 president harold friedman 
and secretary anthony hughes began oct 12 
in 1987 tv news reporter mike conway radio news broadcaster 
judy thompson and photographer ted schwartz asked to be allowed to 
bring cameras and other equipment into the courtroom to cover the 
upcoming trial 
us district judge george w white rejected their request 
banning cameras and the other broadcast equipment serves the 
significant government interest of promoting fair and accurate 
factfinding by assuring that litigants and witnesses are not 
distracted by media shyness or showboating white said 
the 6th us circuit court of appeals upheld whites ruling in 
july 
the appeals court noted that a 1981 supreme court ruling said the 
constitution permits the broadcasting televising or photographing 
of criminal trials 
but the appeals court said that is a far cry from holding 
that the constitution does require that these activities be 
permitted during judicial proceedings 
the media representatives said banning such coverage of trials 
promotes nothing more than federal judicial insularity 
they said limiting access to a trial to the print media alone 
and to those few members of the public fortunate enough to squeeze 
into the courtroom in a case of great public interest denies 
firsthand realtime access to tens of millions of citizens 
they also said that modern technology permits tv cameras and 
radio equipment to be used unobtrusively 
most states permit some electronic media coverage of judicial 
proceedings but the federal courts including the supreme court 
ban such coverage

the supreme court today rejected a freepress 
challenge to a judges order that barred participants in the 
criminal trial of exrep mario biaggi dny from talking to news 
reporters 
the court over three dissenting votes turned away arguments 
that the gag order a federal judge imposed during the 
sincecompleted wedtech corp corruption trial was an unlawful prior 
restraint 
justices byron r white william j brennan and thurgood marshall 
voted to hear arguments in the case but the votes of at least four 
justices are needed to grant such review 
white in an opinion joined by brennan and marshall said the 
high court should resolve a conflict among federal appeals courts 
over the issue of gag orders 
biaggi who has given up the congressional seat he held for 20 
years was convicted of extortion tax evasion bribery and 
conspiracy last august 
prosecutors said biaggi extorted money from wedtech a defense 
contractor in his south bronx congressional district in exchange 
for his political clout 
biaggi stood trial with six others criminally charged in the 
wedtech scandal 
before the muchpublicized trial began us district judge john 
m cannella ordered the defendants their lawyers and the federal 
prosecutors to refrain from making public statements about the case 
other than to repeat what already was a matter of public record 
various news organizations objected to the order contending that 
it imposed a constitutionally impermissible prior restraint on the 
press and on the freespeech rights of the trial participants 
past supreme court decisions have said prior restraints on speech 
rarely are justified and may be used only as a last resort to 
ensure fair trials 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in upholding the 
wedtech trial gag order last march 14 ruled that it was not really 
a prior restraint 
there is a fundamental difference between a gag order 
challenged by the individual gagged and the one challenged by a 
third party an order objected to by the former is properly 
characterized as a prior restraint one opposed solely by the latter 
is not the appeals court said 
the appeals court suggested that it would be a prior restraint on 
the press only if the news media already had the information and 
were barred from publishing it 
the appeals court noted that cannella was troubled by what seemed 
to be leaked information about the wedtechconnected prosecutions 
the problem begins not with the publishing of news by a free 
press but with a hemorrhage of small leaks of secret grand jury 
information the 2nd circuit court said this leads directly to 
prosecutor and defense counsel inciting trial by the press 
in the appeal acted on today five news organizations argued that 
the appeals court wrongly subjected the gag order to a less rigorous 
standard of review simply because it was challenged by potential 
recipients of speech rather than potential speakers 
the appeal urged the justices to outlaw such judicial orders 
without a finding that there is a serious and imminent threat to a 
defendants right to an impartial jury 
the five news organizations that filed the appeal are dow jones amp 
co cbs nbc the associated press and newsday 
the case is dow jones vs simon 88229

lloyd bentsen sharing the platform with a caged 
quail made a lastditch appeal to salvage his home state of texas 
for the democratic ticket today despite polls showing michael 
dukakis trailing republican candidate george bush badly 
its in your hands to win it you can do it the democratic 
vice presidential nominee told 250 supporters at a dallas rally 
go flat out win texas and then the united states 
standing near a live quail in a cage at dallas union station 
the texas senator taunted bush and running mate dan quayle how do 
you like the idea of george bush as president and dan quayle 
standing in the wings he asked turning his thumb down and 
drawing hoots from the crowd 
bentsen was ending his campaign with a onetwo punch at every 
stop on election eve he accused the republicans of dirty 
campaigning and assured his listeners that democrats are friends of 
working people 
were on your side and they are not he said 
noting that nearly 200 texas banks have failed in the past few 
years bentsen accused the vice president of doing nothing for 
texas which bush claims as a residence while the reagan 
administration was helping bankers in illinois and new york 
we want a texan in there whos interested in texas bentsen 
said were going to help texas 
bentsen insists that texas and its 29 electoral votes are 
winnable for the democrats even though many polls show he and 
dukakis trailing by double digits 
dukakis running mate was scouring texas for votes and heading 
via louisiana for hastily arranged visits to arkansas and missouri 
his scheduled stops today included shreveport la and houston 
beaumont and san antonio texas 
the schedule was originally scheduled to end after san antonio 
but late sunday the campaign added nighttime rallies in little rock 
ark and kansas city mo two states the democrats are still 
hoping to swing in their direction 
in addition to his public stops bentsen will be doing interviews 
via satellite with television stations in several other key states 
were doing handtohand combat in texas and were going for 
the airwaves in battleground states said mike mccurry the 
campaigns director of communications 
the expanded schedule he said was to take advantage of a 
dramatic tightening of the race in missouri and arkansas mccurry 
said the question is whether it is enough time to bring about 
an upset of the republican ticket he said 
dukakis himself has launched into aroundtheclock campaigning 
heading into election day with an early morning event in cleveland 
a stop in st louis and a return visit to california for a san 
francisco rally 
however the sleepless campaign swing was not being asked of the 
67yearold bentsen 
in el paso on sunday bentsen told a rally outside the citys 
train station that the democrats are concerned about the middle 
class a theme dukakis has been hammering in his campaign stops 
mike dukakis and lloyd bentsen are on the side of the working 
men and women of america and the republicans are on the other 
side said the democratic candidate who addressed the crowd in 
both spanish and english an appeal to the states large hispanic 
population 
like dukakis bentsen has for the past few weeks made attacks on 
the negative tone of the republican campaign a central theme of his 
own the backlash from the gop distortions bentsen says is a 
major factor in the democrats narrowing of the republican lead in 
the polls 
surveys released sunday showed bush leading dukakis by margins 
ranging from five points to 12 points 
bentsen told reporters on sunday that the tone of the campaign 
has hurt both bush and dukakis and said that no matter who wins 
neither one will have a serious mandate 
i certainly dont think george bush will have a mandate because 
of the negative campaign thats been run he said 
as for his democratic running mate bentsen said michael 
dukakis will not have as much as a mandate as he deserves because it 
was difficult to get the issues across with all the clutter of 
negative advertising he said 
but i also believe the two of us together with me as vice 
president that we will be able to get our legislative program 
through better than george bush and dan quayle would 
the lack of a mandate means more work and a lot more swabbing 
that has to be done and i think mike dukakis can do that he said

the official media today launched an attack 
on lech walesa in response to the solidarity leaders threat of 
strikes unless authorities suspend the decision to close the lenin 
shipyard in gdansk 
an editorial in the communist party daily trybuna ludu said in 
the past it was alleged that when the authorities lacked arguments 
they resorted to repression today when lech walesa lacks 
arguments he loads the strike cannon 
the editorial follows remarks by the leader of the banned union 
federation sunday that he was prepared to call a nationwide strike 
alert to demand preservation of the 10000worker shipyard the 
birthplace of solidarity 
the commentary was unusual because the official press recently 
had avoided criticizing walesa by name while the government and the 
opposition prepared talks on polands future 
but the proposed talks have stalled and now the government and 
opposition appear to be on a collision course over the scheduled 
dec 1 closing of the shipyard 
in a period when concrete decisions are being made about 
reforms lech walesa has a different plan strike alert and 
strikes it happened before the country does not need strike amok 
but reconciliation 
a statement released sunday by solidaritys national executive 
commission threatened broad protests including strikes if the 
government does not rescind the shipyard decision 
it was the strongest from solidarity since communist authorities 
announced oct 31 that they intend to close the shipyard 
on saturday walesa said he would not meet with interior minister 
czeslaw kiszczak to discuss plans for the talks unless the shipyard 
decision is suspended and all workers fired for taking part in 
strikes in august are rehired 
walesa aide piotr konopka said the solidarity leader told 
worshipers at st brygidas church in gdansk sunday that he would 
call a national strike alert at a workers rally scheduled 
tuesday in the baltic port 
if there is still great pressure on him from the side of the 
shipyard and other enterprises as well then on tuesday he will 
announce a strike alert for the whole country said konopka 
a strike alert would mean organizing strike committees and 
getting workers prepared to strike at any moment said solidarity 
spokesman wojciech maziarski 
the solidarity statement denounced the decision to close the yard 
as a dangerous political act and an act of revenge against 
solidarity 
it said any closures should be preceded by a period of review of 
economic performance with workers and their representatives taking 
part 
since promising aug 31 to meet with the opposition to discuss 
legalization of solidarity and how to revive polands limping 
economy the government has discouraged prospects by insisting that 
solidarity drop two alleged extremists from its delegation to the 
talks 
that condition together with officials decision to close the 
shipyard and the failure to rehire at least 100 workers fired for 
roles in the august strikes has convinced solidarity that the

president reagan told fellow 
californians today their votes could be crucial in assuring a new 
beginning for america by electing republican george bush as 
president and staving off a latehour drive by democrat michael 
dukakis 
in a speech prepared for delivery at the queen mary a former 
luxury ocean liner converted to a waterfront hotel the 77yearold 
president said he was returning to his home state at the end of the 
bush campaign just as he did in his own campaigns for the white 
house 
today of course is the last day of this my last campaign as 
president he said but tomorrow launches a new beginning for 
america 
your votes tomorrow may be the most important ones cast in 
america the president said they will determine how california 
goes and california may send the next president to the white 
house 
california has 47 electoral votes as the most populous state 
reagan lavished praise on bush who has served under him for 
nearly eight years as vice president 
this year one of the best qualified men to ever seek the 
office of president is on the ballot he said 
of bushs personal qualities reagan said he is strong 
decent loyal wise capable and compassionate 
as for his opponent we only really began to learn about him 
during the last few months the president said he has been 
vague as to what he would do in office yet when we focus on his 
record he objects 
reagan contended that the democratic nominee is against 
voluntary prayer in school appointed judges to his state supreme 
court who have voted to strike down a ban on child pornography 
and in every case even for the most brutal crimes he opposes the 
death penalty 
hes free to have these views but is this the man we want 
choosing the justices to sit on the supreme court of the united 
states he asked 
the former movie actor recalled that it was from the queen mary 
then a british liner that he first saw the statue of liberty on his 
return from england where he filmed the hasty heart 
this is my last campaign and seeing all of you and seeing 
the queen mary again its like closing a circle like sailing into 
harbor after a long and wonderful voyage to be greeted by old 
beloved friends the president said 
from long beach reagan 77 headed to san diego for a nostalgic 
visit to the seaside city where he held his final campaign rally on 
the eve of his landslide reelection in 1984 
he was flying for 10 hours and 20 minutes during a roundtrip from 
washington just to make two speeches in three hours and five minutes 
in his home state 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan will have 
traveled about 25000 miles and made 30 political appearances in 16 
states for bush since labor day including todays trip 
he said reagan was making his first roundtrip to california in a 
single day at the request of the bush campaign because gop polls say 
the presidential contest is nip and tuck in the state 
the former hollywood movie star who spent two terms in 
sacramento as governor made seven earlier political appearances in 
california during the current presidential campaign 
he spoke in long beach and irvine on aug 23 in thousand oaks 
and santa barbara on aug 27 in san diego on oct 27 and in 
fullerton and san bernardino last wednesday 
san diego is a prime target because the county is one of 
californias most heavily republican with more registered gop 
voters than democrats although the democrats hold a statewide 
registration edge of 504 percent to 386 percent san bernardino 
county also has more registered republicans than democrats as does 
orange county in which irvine and fullerton are located 
the latest california poll conducted by mervin field and 
released thursday gave bush an 8point edge among likely voters 
however an administration official traveling with reagan on 
saturday speaking on condition he not be identified said more 
recent republican tracking polls showed that bushs lead had 
narrowed dukakis spokesmen said their polls showed the same thing

the supreme court today agreed to study the 
case of a former dallas high school football coach who says he lost 
his job because he is white 
the court said it will hear competing appeals filed by norman 
jett longtime coach and athletic director at south oak cliff high 
school in dallas and by the dallas independent school district 
the justices will study a 5th us circuit court of appeals 
ruling that ordered a new trial for jetts lawsuit against the city 
school district and frederick todd south oak cliffs principal 
a federal jury had awarded jett 850000 in damages reduced by a 
federal trial judge to about 563000 
jett had coached the south oak cliff football team since 1962 
when in the spring of 1983 he was transferred to another city high 
school 
jett had been named head coach and athletic director at the 
school in 1970 the year the racial composition at south oak cliff 
changed from predominantly white to predominantly black 
todd who is black became the schools principal in 1975 
according to the 5th circuit court tensions between todd and 
jett were exasperated by events surrounding south oak cliffs loss 
to plano in the state high school championship game in november 1982 
jetts appeal said todd believed that south oak cliff would 
have to recruit young black athletes at the junior high school level 
and he evidently believed that a successful recruiter would have to 
be black 
the appeal added that todd decided to replace jett with a black 
coach 
jett sued the school district and todd over his transfer to a 
teaching position at another school 
his suit filed under a muchused civil rights law alleged that 
school officials had violated his dueprocess freespeech and 
equalprotection rights 
the jury ruled that the city school district should be held 
legally liable for what it found to be violations of jetts rights 
but the appeals court ruled that the jury did not make sufficient 
findings to support municipal liability 
the appeals court ordered a new trial for that reason 
the issue to be studied by the justices is whether public 
employees who claim racial discrimination must show that the bias 
resulted from official policy or custom before recovering 
damages from their employers 
the cases are jett vs dallas independent school district 
872084 and dallas independent school district vs jett 88214

the supreme court today ruled that huntington 
ny officials reinforced racial segregation by confining housing 
for lowincome families to a predominantly nonwhite urban renewal 
area 
by a 63 vote the justices upheld a ruling that could make it 
easier to use a federal civil rights law to challenge community 
zoning ordinances that limit lowcost housing 
but the high court in a fourpage unsigned opinion declined to 
answer the key question posed by the case does a zoning regulation 
violate fair housing provisions of the civil rights act of 1968 when 
there is evidence of discriminatory impact but not discriminatory 
motives 
city officials conceded originally that the disparate impact 
theory applied to the case the justices said 
we are satisfied on this record that disparate impact was 
shown and that the sole justification proferred to rebut that 
argument was inadequate the high court said we do not reach 
the question whether that test is the appropriate one 
justices byron r white thurgood marshall and john paul stevens 
dissented they voted to hear arguments in the case to explore the 
issue 
a federal appeals court said statistical studies showing a zoning 
ordinances discriminatory effects even if unintentional could 
establish a violation of the 1968 law 
the alternative approach supported by the reagan administration 
among others would require the more difficult task of proving the 
zoning ordinance is intentionally biased 
administration lawyers supported the appeal by huntington 
officials 
congress intended to require a showing of intentional 
discrimination when it passed the fair housing law justice 
department lawyers said 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled last april that 
huntingtons zoning ordinance perpetuated segregation by confining 
to a predominantly black area subsidized apartments designed to 
benefit poorer families 
the disproportionate harm to blacks and the segregative impact 
on the entire community resulting from the refusal to rezone create 
a strong showing of discriminatory effect the appeals court 
said 
the town failed to present bona fide and legitimate 
justifications for its action or show there were no less 
discriminatory alternatives available the appeals court added 
another new york community yonkers has been embroiled in a 
fight over a court order to build low and moderateincome housing 
in that case the 2nd circuit court ruled yonkers acted unlawfully 
by intentionally maintaining segregated housing and schools 
huntington a long island community of some 200000 residents 
has a black population of less than 35 percent most blacks live in 
two neighborhoods 
the national association for the advancement of colored people 
along with a local group called housing help inc sued the town in 
1981 for its refusal to approve multifamily dwellings on a 
148acre site in greenlawn a predominantly white hamlet of 
singlefamily houses 
housing help inc proposed to build 162 federally subsidized 
lowincome apartments there 
a federal judge ruled that huntingtons zoning ordinance did not 
violate the 1968 federal civil rights act 
huntington officials noted that the town has 775 lowincome 
housing units and said the town has done its fair share in 
developing subsidized dwellings 
but the 2nd circuit court said confining such apartments to the 
urban renewal area has a disproportionate impact on blacks 
while the appeals court acknowledged there are more poor whites 
than blacks in the community it noted that only 7 percent of all 
huntington families needed subsidized housing while 24 percent of 
black families needed such help 
placing lowincome housing in predominantly white greenlawn will 
promote integration the 2nd circuit court said 
the appeals court said it took the extraordinary step of ordering 
huntington to approve the proposed 162unit project because 
further delay might well prove fatal to the plan 
the case is huntington vs naacp 871961

the supreme court today rejected an appeal by a 
north dakota couple charged with truancy for educating their son at 
home in accord with their religious principles 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that reinstated 
the charges 
jonathan melin pastor of the faith baptist church in oakes 
nd and his wife diana were accused of failing to send their 
son teddy to public school as required by state law 
the melins who have bachelors degrees said they are qualified 
to teach teddy at home 
north dakota law requires that children attend public school or 
be taught by a statecertified teacher the melins who do not have 
such certification said north dakota is the only state that has an 
absolute requirement that homeschool teachers be certified 
a state judge in 1987 threw out the truancy charges against the 
melins on grounds the teacher certification requirement violated 
their constitutionally protected right to exercise their religion 
freely 
but the north dakota supreme court reinstated the charges last 
july 
the state court said reviving the case would not violate the 
melins protection against double jeopardy being prosecuted twice 
for the same alleged offense 
the judge who dismissed the case did not acquit them the state 
court said 
double jeopardy occurs only when the trial court has resolved 
some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged the 
state court said 
the state court also rejected the melins argument that requiring 
them to be statecertified is not the least restrictive means of 
enforcing the states compelling interest in the education of 
children 
we continue to believe the state has compelling interest in 
ensuring that when public or nonpublic education occurs that it is 
conducted by persons who are knowledgeable and who are able to 
impart that knowledge in a manner conducive to a childs 
education the state court said 
requiring teachers to be certified by the state furthers that 
goal it added 
the case is melin vs north dakota 88470

winnie mandela today paid a 
hospital visit to her husband african national congress leader 
nelson mandela the government denied media speculation that he or 
his colleagues would be released 
several south african newspapers have been quoting government 
sources for the past week as saying mandela would be released before 
the end of the year from his life prison sentence he was imprisoned 
in 1962 
the prisons service and other government sources emphatically 
denied that either mandela or any of the other five men imprisoned 
with him for plotting to overthrow the government would be released 
today the officials would not comment on the possibility of 
releases at a future date 
mrs mandelas visit lasted 45 minutes and was described by cape 
town attorney essa moosa as normal 
moosa and the rev allan boesak president of the world alliance 
of reformed churches accompanied mrs mandela 
boesak an antiapartheid activist said there was no 
indication mandela would be released today or in the near future 
one government source indicated his belief that the rumors 
circulating today were being orchestrated by members of the 
antiapartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some 
action 
the rumors have been building since august when the 70yearold 
mandela was transferred from pollsmoor prison to a cape town 
hospital for treatment of tuberculosis he was later transferred to 
the private constantiaberg clinic where doctors say he has 
recovered 
president pw botha said he hoped it would be possible not to 
send mandela back to prison 
mandela has rejected bothas offers to release him in exchange 
for a renunciation of violence saying the government must make a 
similar renunciation and lift restrictions on black political 
activity 
in addition to mandela african national congress 
secretarygeneral walter sisulu and four lesser known anc members 
are still in prison from the 1964 trial 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in

the two german nations today recalled the fascist 
racial madness of kristallnacht the night a halfcentury ago that 
signaled the start of the systematic nazi campaign to annihilate 
jews 
towns and cities in the east and the west have begun paying 
tribute to the victims of the night of nov 9 1938 when nazi 
sympathizers looted and burned jewish temples and businesses 
beating and killing scores of jews and sending 30000 of them to 
concentration camps 
the rampage became known as kristallnacht or crystal night 
because of the shards of broken glass that filled the streets 
josef foschepoth the general secretary of west germanys 
societies for christianjewish cooperation said the night marked 
the start of a new phase the phase of the physical annihilation 
of the jews 
this week hundreds of gatherings panel discussions and 
ceremonies will mark the 50th anniversary wednesday of what the west 
german news agency adn called a night of fascist racial madness 
in the east german city of leipzig officials and members of the 
jewish community today paid tribute to the victims by laying wreaths 
at the site of the synagogue that was destroyed and at the citys 
jewish cemetery 
peter kirchner the head of east germanys tiny jewish community 
said his nation which has emphasized how communists as well as 
jews were persecuted by the nazis appears to be learning more from 
the lessons of the past than neighboring west germany 
in east germany theres a greater cracking down on 
neofascist ways of thought than in west germany where meetings 
of former nazis can take place under police protection kirchner 
said sunday in an interview on west germanys deutschlandfunk radio 
the city of potsdam just outside berlin has organized an exhibit 
about jewish life during the nazi era which includes shocking 
original fascist documents in which an expulsion order and the 
stripping of german citizenship are communicated to jews 
according to the news agency 
residents of koenigstein a west german town of 16500 near 
frankfurt on sunday placed a wreath at the site where the synagogue 
was burned down on nov 10 1938 
west germanys bundestag or parliament will hold a solemn 
ceremony on thursday 
in the city of darmstadt about 25 miles south of frankfurt a 
new synagogue will be dedicated wednesday 
the number of deaths on kristallnacht remains uncertain at least 
195 synagogues and about 7500 jewish businesses were either 
destroyed or badly damaged some estimates put the number of 
vandalized synagogues at more than 1100 
throughout germany that night 91 jews met their death under 
the sticks boots and bullets of the death squads of the nazi 
movement foschepoth told 125 residents of koenigstein on sunday 
how was all this possible 
during their rule from 1933 to 1945 the nazis murdered an 
estimated 6 million jews 
west germany has paid the equivalent of 44 billion at todays 
currency exchange rates in compensation to holocaust victims and 
their survivors 
there are about 32000 jews living in west germany while the 
number of practicing jews in east germany is estimated to be between 
450 and 600

a kidney specialist has been ordered 
to provide dialysis for another week to a woman refused the 
lifegiving treatment by more than a dozen other doctors 
but a temporary restraining order issued friday also said jeanie 
joshua of ojai must go elsewhere for treatment after the order 
expires friday 
the ucla medical center has accepted her for dialysis but ms 
joshua said the 80mile trip three days a week would be impossible 
for her in her weakened condition 
this is going to be a slow death theres no way i can 
withstand it said ms joshua a friend now drives her 40 miles to 
cottage hospital in santa barbara 
ms joshua 38 claims kidney specialists from santa barbara to 
simi valley have refused to treat her because of her 1986 lawsuit 
against a santa barbara specialist that contends impure water was 
used in the bloodpurifying dialysis procedure the suit is pending 
her current physician dr david w doner jr told the los 
angeles times he was dropping ms joshua because she was too 
aggressive in directing her medical treatment and because he could 
not find another specialist to see her if he needed to leave town 
ms joshua described herself as an assertive patient who 
sometimes refuses to take tests or treatments she disagrees with 
three medical groups representing 11 doctors in southern santa 
barbara and ventura counties have refused to see her she said 
doner has a legal right to drop the woman as a patient his 
lawyer said its wellestablished law that a physician may select 
which patients he cares for said harold m haider 
the few court cases on the issue have generally upheld a doctors 
right to drop a patient or refuse to accept someone as a new 
patient said arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical 
ethics at the university of minnesota 
but arrangements have usually been made to provide 
lifesustaining treatment even to combative or abusive patients he 
said 
there are cases where patients have been dialyzed while 
shackled to a bed or with an armed guard present caplan said 
you cant just be abandoned in a lifeanddeath situation

communications to the affected area radio station dzge in naga 
reported 10 people six of them children were killed today in a 
mudslide near the city about 210 miles southeast of manila 
there was no official confirmation of the report 
the department of social services said about 200000 people had 
been affected by skip the second typhoon to hit the philippines 
in two weeks 
most of them were on leyte island which was without electricity 
after skip blew down power lines the department said

sank a freighter in port

areas residents of coastal areas were advised to move to higher 
ground and small craft were ordered to remain in port 
the storm was expected to pass about 75 miles south of manila 
early tuesday forecasters said manila could expect strong winds and 
rains but predicted less damage in the capital than during typhoon 
ruby two weeks ago 
philippine airlines canceled at least 35 domestic flights today 
as the storm approached the coast guard suspended all passenger 
ship service to ports in the visayas islands sunday stranding

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the government may confiscate from criminal defendants money 
and property that could be used to pay their legal fees 
the court announced it will review cases stemming from federal 
prosecutions of drug dealers in new york and virginia 
the justices thus set the stage for an important ruling on the 
rights of the accused and the governments power to fight crime by 
seizing illicit criminal proceeds their decision is expected in 
1989 
in one case the law firm of caplin amp drysdale here was denied 
170000 in legal fees for representing christopher reckmeyer he 
pleaded guilty in 1985 in virginia to charges stemming from what 
prosecutors said was his role as kingpin of a multimilliondollar 
drug operation 
reckmeyer was sentenced to 17 years in prison and was ordered to 
forfeit all proceeds from the drug deals the seizure of the money 
left him without funds to pay caplin amp drysdale 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled last january that 
reckmeyer is not entitled to use any of the money to reimburse the 
law firm 
in the second case the reagan administration appealed a ruling 
that allows peter monsanto access to assets worth 400000 to help 
him pay his lawyers 
monsanto was convicted in new york city of charges he headed a 
heroinselling ring 
the jury also ordered him to forfeit to the government a house in 
mount vernon ny valued at 335000 a 30000 cooperative 
apartment in the bronx and 35000 in cash 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals ruled in july he could 
use the assets to pay legitimate legal fees incurred in his defense 
at issue are forfeiture provisions of key federal crimefighting 
laws including the continuing criminal enterprise act and the 
racketeer influenced corrupt organizations statute 
the 4th circuit court ruled in reckmeyers case that the 
constitutional right of the accused to be represented by a lawyer 
does not entitle the defendant to an attorney of his choice 
the right to counsel of choice belongs only to those with 
legitimate assets the appeals court said in a 74 decision the 
right to counsel does not guarantee that every defendant will have 
the lawyer he desires 
caplin amp drysdale and other attorneys argue that confiscating 
the assets of people when they are indicted will leave them too poor 
to pay their own lawyers 
the 4th circuit court and the reagan administration said those 
defendants will still be represented by courtappointed attorneys 
the appeals court used the example of a robber caught with 
100000 taken from a bank 
surely no one will contend that the 100000 must be made 
available to pay the defendants lawyer and not be kept available 
for return to the bank in the event the defendant is found guilty 
the 4th circuit court said 
but the 2nd circuit appeals court in an 84 decision said 
monsanto is entitled to use his assets to pay his lawyer 
the 2nd circuit ruling produced eight opinions including three 
by those in the majority who ruled in monsantos favor 
one opinion favoring monsanto that was signed by three judges 
said the government must prove that an accused is guilty beyond a 
reasonable doubt it must do this by obtaining convincing evidence 
of the defendants guilt not by preventing the defendant from 
retaining counsel of choice 
in other action the court 
agreed to decide a recurring copyright question by reviewing a 
dispute over a sculpture depicting the plight of the homeless 
commissioned by the community for creative nonviolence 
the court said it will hear an appeal by the group and its 
founder mitch snyder who seek exclusive copyright ownership of the 
work 
refused to reinstate an unusual racial quota system designed to 
prevent white flight from the nations largest publicly assisted 
housing development 
the court with one dissenting vote let stand a ruling that the 
racial distribution of apartments at the middleincome starrett city 
development in brooklyn ny violates the federal fair housing act 
rejected an appeal by a company challenging federal guidelines 
for controlling and removing asbestos in school buildings 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the 
regulations are reasonable 
rejected a freepress challenge to a judges order that barred 
participants in the criminal trial of former rep mario biaggi 
dny from talking to news reporters 
the court over three dissenting votes turned away arguments 
that the gag order a federal judge imposed during the 
sincecompleted wedtech corp corruption trial was an unlawful prior 
restraint 
let stand a ruling a that barred television and still cameras 
and radio broadcasting equipment from a trial of the late teamsters 
president jackie presser and two others 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by media 
representatives in cleveland who said banning broadcast and 
photographic coverage of an important union corruption case violates 
the constitutions freepress guarantees 
agreed to study the case of a former dallas high school

nearly a thousand officers from around 
the northeast marched today in the funeral procession of a police 
cadet who collapsed during a rigorous training program 
timothy shepard 25 underwent a liver transplant a week after he 
fell ill on a running track at the staterun police academy in 
agawam near springfield 
he lapsed into a coma for two weeks emerged then lost 
consciousness last monday he died wednesday at a pittsburgh 
hospital his death and the hospitalization of several other cadets 
has prompted a reexamination of the states police training 
programs 
despite his pain despite his suffering his wracked body 
hooked to machines he smiled and he shed the light of his life on 
all of us the rev peter gregory a family friend and chaplain at 
mercy hospital in springfield said in his homily god was with 
him in a special way 
scores of pittsfield officers led the 150cruiser procession to 
st josephs roman catholic church followed by police on 
motorcycles and horseback color guards from 50 departments in all 
six new england states and new york and members of the pittsfield 
boys club shepard had been named the clubs youth of the year in 
1981 
after the funeral the procession was to head to st josephs 
cemetery a halfmile away for burial 
lines outside the 1500seat church began forming more than an 
hour before the funeral and loudspeakers were hung outside the 
building 
among the mourners were state police troopers from western 
massachusetts and the 46 cadets still training at agawam state 
police said they scaled back their presence at the funeral from six 
cruisers of troopers after shepards family initially asked that 
state police not attend at all they withdrew the request sunday 
according to pittsfield mayor anne everest wojtkowski 
more than 2000 people turned out for shepards wake saturday and 
sunday the police departments teletype machine has received 
messages of condolence from all over the northeast and even from as 
far south as delaware said lt gerald lee 
the last pittsfield officer to die in the line of duty was killed 
in 1898 while pushing a woman and her child to safety off the tracks 
of an oncoming train 
shepard was one of 16 cadets hospitalized in the first week of 
training the illness prompted at least three state investigations 
and resulted in the resignation of the head of the states police 
training program 
an autopsy friday indicated shepard died from infections that set 
in because of his weakened condition from training and a liver 
transplant 
shepard had collapsed from heat stroke sept 19 at the end of the 
grueling first day of training other cadets reported that they were 
put through a strenuous regimen for hours on just a few cups of 
water 
shepards death will be the subject of an inquest to determine 
whether criminal charges should be brought against the state 
troopers in charge of training 
a monthlong investigation into the illnesses found a massive 
failure of the system that led to abusive training

american clinic his former press officer said today 
derek taylor the beatles press agent for six years said the 
couple had undergone four weeks of an eightweek program at the 
unidentified clinic in the united states taylors comments could 
not be independently confirmed 
he said starr telephoned his london office from the united states 
to announce the couples admission to the clinic 
the message he left was we are doing fine we are very well 
and we are in recovery taylor said 
ringo wanted this to go public because it was already seeping 
out through fellow guests at the clinic he said i got the call 
from ringos london office to put out a statement saying he wished 
it to be known he is a recovering alcoholic

the supreme court today refused to reinstate an 
unusual racial quota system designed to prevent white flight 
from the nations largest publicly assisted housing development 
the court with one dissenting vote let stand a ruling that the 
racial distribution of apartments at the middleincome starrett city 
development in brooklyn ny violates the federal fair housing act 
justice byron r white voted to hear arguments in the case but 
at least four votes are required to grant such review 
the owners of starrett city said they tried to preserve 
integration at the development by allocating 64 percent of the 
apartments to whites 22 percent to blacks and 8 percent to 
hispanics the remaining apartments were for orientals and other 
minorities 
starrett city with 46 highrise buildings 5881 apartments and 
more than 17000 people receives state and federal financial 
assistance and tax breaks from new york city 
the quota system has meant that blacks and hispanics seeking 
apartments in starrett city have spent long periods on the waiting 
list 
a group of black applicants filed a federal suit in 1979 
challenging the quotas 
the suit was settled in 1984 with the owners agreeing to provide 
an additional 175 apartments over five years for blacks and other 
minority applicants 
the federal government then filed its own suit a month after the 
settlement alleging the quotas violate the antidiscrimination fair 
housing act of 1968 
the reagan administration said it is illegal to impose quotas 
that hurt minority applicants even if the purpose is to maintain a 
system of racial balance that will discourage whites from fleeing 
the system denies blacks and hispanics the freedom to live 
where income permits the reagan administration said 
arguing that the housing complex will become predominantly black 
and hispanic if quotas are not maintained blatantly caters to 
white prejudice the justice department said 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in a 21 ruling last 
march agreed with the government 
the fair housing act does not permit rigid racial quotas of 
indefinite duration to maintain a fixed level of integration at 
starrett city by restricting minority access to scarce and desirable 
rental accommodations the appeals court said 
judge jon o newman in a dissenting opinion on the appeals 
court said he was convinced abandoning the quotas would produce 
white flight the fair housing act does not require this tragedy 
to occur he said 
the owners of starrett city were supported in their appeal to the 
supreme court by the developments tenants association 
the successful 15year experiment at the nations largest 
federally assisted housing development is in jeopardy the 
association said 
the case is vs starrett city vs us 8882

george bush and michael dukakis talked confidently of fast 
finishes today as they crossed paths in battleground states on the 
final day before americans choose a new president underdog dukakis 
promised a november surprise while bush declared he was 
finishing not in a power walk but in a sprint 
like dukakis democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen 
was racing through key states in addition to several stops in his 
home base of texas bentsen was slated to campaign in louisiana 
arkansas and missouri 
bentsen appeared in dallas with a caged quail at his side and 
drew hoots from a crowd when he asked how do you like the idea of 
george bush as president and dan quayle standing in the wings 
the gop vice presidential nominee campaigned in maryland and in 
safely republican virginia as well as indiana his home state 
the latest polls bolstered the vice presidents optimism as he 
followed his democratic rival into ohio and roared toward st louis 
at a sunrise rally in a steelworkers union hall outside 
cleveland dukakis was in high spirits after snatching a twohour 
nap on an overnight flight from the west coast 
good morning ohio he said we took the redeye to be with 
the buckeyes 
i dont need sleep im charging he said were going to 
win 
bush began his day in the detroit suburb of southfield mich 
and took a jab at dukakis fondness for exercising by walking 
rapidly while carrying weights 
the vice president said the race in michigan was close and its 
a very important place to be as we run right down to the finish 
line not in a power walk but in a sprint 
bush said that when americans vote they should ask themselves 
this question is the country headed in the right direction the 
answer is yes it is 
from michigan bush was headed for rallies in ohio missouri and 
texas where he maintains his voting residence 
dukakis preceded bush into st louis by a couple of hours and 
told his audience this is the show me state and im here to 
show you how much i want your support he said 
then in a reference to bushs summer home in maine dukakis 
asked are you going to let the pollsters and pundits decide this 
election or are you going to send a message that can be heard from 
california to kennebunkport 
they talk a lot about october surprises in an election 
campaign he told supporters tomorrow were going to have a 
november surprise 
the race is very very tight its getting tighter by the 
hour dukakis said 
president reagan was spending the day campaigning for bush in 
california 
both camps bombarded voters with 30second commercials and the 
two candidates were the stars of 30minute prime time election eve 
programs running backtoback on abc cbs and nbc 
the bush campaign unleashed a final attack ad a fiveminute 
television commercial that summed up all the earlier attacks on 
dukakis record 
its running in selected markets its a broad overview of 
everything that michael dukakis stands for according to his 
record bush ad director sig rogich said 
the ad features massachusetts residents and officials complaining 
about dukakis handling of pollution in boston harbor the states 
prisoner furlough program and the states economy including taxes 
jobs and budget shortfalls bush does not appear 
a rush of late national polls said the republican vice president 
was leading by margins ranging from five to 12 percentage points 
a 50state abc newswashington post poll of 7777 likely voters 
said bush was solidly favored or leading in states with enough 
electoral votes to assure his election 
an associated press statebystate survey said bush was leading 
in states with 356 electoral votes 86 more than the 270 needed for 
a majority while dukakis was ahead in states with a total of 101 
electoral votes another 81 were in tossup states that included 
pennsylvania illinois and missouri 
among the new polls gallup put bush ahead by 12 percentage 
points while usa todaycnn made it 11 abc set the margin at 10 and 
cbs said the difference was nine points an nbc newswall street 
journal poll and another by louis harris and associates said the 
margin for the vice president was five points with enough people 
undecided or wavering to allow for dramatic lastminute changes 
the presidential candidates werent the only ones winding up 
their campaigns 
there were 33 senate seats and the entire house being filled on 
tuesday and 12 states were electing governors 
democratic control of the senate and house appeared secure and 
the democrats appeared likely to add to the 27 to 23 edge they now 
have among governors 
thousands of other offices were being filled and scores of 
initiatives also were on ballots including 39 in california on 
which opposing sides spent more than 100 million 
dukakis began a marathon race around the country late sunday 
flying from spokane wash to cleveland with a dawn arrival in the 
ohio city from cleveland he was heading for st louis and then on 
to san francisco 
aides were considering another 1000mile detour from san 
francisco before addressing a rally in los angeles then it was on 
to a predawn election day rally in des moines iowa and a stop in 
new jersey or ohio before ending the campaign back home in boston 
whatever sleep he got would be in a tourist class seat on his 
campaign plane 
bush told a celebritystudded rally in southern california that 
dukakis was putting up a last minute smokescreen so now all 
thats left is this daily whining about a negative campaign 
dont listen to the crying on the far left

after a yearlong presidential campaign how 
long will americans have to wait tuesday night to find out who won 
four states where the polls close early could provide the answer 
the winner could be known early if republican george bush is 
making a strong showing 
but if democrat michael dukakis is doing well it could be a long 
night with the result hanging on returns from the west coast 
the four states cited by election analyst william schneider of 
the american enterprise institute are connecticut kentucky ohio 
and vermont 
if dukakis wins vermont and connecticut its good news for the 
democrats said schneider keep tuned if dukakis wins kentucky 
and ohio its very good news for the democrats 
on the other hand he said if bush wins all of those states 
it ought to be a good night for him 
of those four states ohio has been targeted by both bush and 
dukakis both candidates campaigned there monday the last of 
several trips theyve made to woo ohio voters 
in addition theyve poured a lot of money into advertising and 
direct mail aimed at buckeye voters 
most polls said bush was leading in ohio but dukakis was 
insisting the margin was closing rapidly 
all that attention makes ohio a pretty good barometer of which 
candidates appeal got through best to voters 
dukakis campaign spokesman leslie dach said well be looking 
clearly at places like vermont and connecticut wed like to 
win which we think would be a strong signal for us 
he also cited the big midwest industrial states and then as we 
head further out colorado montana and south dakota are states 
where the democrat hopes to show strength 
another extremely important state where the polls close early and 
the vote is tabulated fairly quickly is illinois 
the results from chicago should indicate how successful dukakis 
was at persuading blacks to get out and vote for him a large black 
turnout in chicago is essential for a democrat to overcome 
republican majorities in the citys suburbs and elsewhere in the 
state 
if dukakis doesnt get that majority it would indicate hes 
probably in trouble wherever black turnout is a factor 
other states to watch for various reasons are massachusetts 
new jersey new york rhode island and west virginia 
massachusetts should be safe for dukakis but if the outcome is 
closer than expected it could be a sign of trouble for the 
massachusetts governor 
the same is true for rhode island also considered part of 
dukakis base but a state where some polls have said the race was 
closer than expected 
the flip side is new jersey which is considered reliably in the 
bush column should dukakis pull an upset or even come close it 
would indicate he could be headed for an upset 
new york was considered part of dukakis base early in the 
campaign but more recent polls said the contest for the states 36 
electoral votes had narrowed considerably 
hard times and a democratic tradition made west virginia look 
like a natural for dukakis populist campaign rhetoric a bush 
victory in the state would signal a bad night for the democrats

tired of paying for expensive deer 
repellent some farmers have adopted a substitute that makes for an 
unusual sight across the countryside deodorant soap dangling from 
trees like christmas ornaments 
dennis adams a university of nebraska extension forester said 
many subscribe to the old folk remedy that uses small pieces of 
scented soap to help prevent deer from damaging trees 
the damage has been increasing every year because the deer 
population has been exploding said adams who has hundreds of 
small bars of soap hanging from trees on his farm 
some deer rub right next to the soap bars but compared to the 
damage we used to get its less he said 
farmer william holdorff has rigged bars of soap throughout his 
orchard of 645 black walnut trees about 30 miles southeast of 
lincoln he said he doesnt mind sharing some of his corn and milo 
with deer but needs some form of repellent to protect his small 
trees 
actually the odor isnt that strong or that repulsive but 
apparently the deer dont like it holdorff said their sense of 
smell is more developed than ours 
at about 6 or 7 cents for a motelsize bar of soap the cost is 
much less than commercial deer repellents he said the small bars 
of soap last through a growing season he said 
september is the best time to place soap in trees adams said 
one bar per tree should be hung from a branch at about the height of 
a deers nose he said

democrats heard it through the

democratic house whip tony coelho and the california democratic

slamming bush for a derogatory remark he made after canceling what 
would have been his fourth campaign trip to the area 
bush said he didnt want to see those damned dancing raisins 
again according to his press secretary sheila tate who told the 
fresno bee that bush was only kidding 
but in fresno the cereal bowl of the nations raisin production 
insulting the popular dancing raisins could be considered sour 
grapes reasoned coelho who represents the regions raisin ranchers 
people dressed in purple raisin suits have danced at numerous 
events including past bush rallies in fresno 
now theyre after our raisins coelho says in the radio spot 
lets elect leaders who stand up for us

ecological doomsayers and wary 
scientists gathered monday for a brainstorming session on how to 
educate people about the consequences of global warming without 
scaring them 
in an address opening the world congress on climate and 
development former west german chancellor willy brandt spelled out 
the ecological evils that have plagued the earth with droughts and 
floods and threatened ultimate destruction of the environment 
he also pointed to the emergence of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev and the imminent change of the us presidency as a hope 
for new attention on the environment 
i think one should not be too optistimic about it but regard 
it as a first step that washington and moscow have made some 
progress on arms control and regional conflicts brandt said at a 
reception following his speech 
referring to what he and other delegates see as a need to 
redirect spending from defense to environmental recovery brandt 
said the superpower initiatives could lead to substantially more 
productive talks on transfer of funds from the one to the other 
the congress which has drawn more than 400 participants from 
east and west and from industrialized as well as developing 
countries aimed to get the diverse nations and interests working 
together to slow down a trend that portends drastic environmental 
change 
former swedish prime minister ola ullsten pointed to this years 
drought in the united states as an example of climatic consequences 
that are emptying the worlds food baskets 
if us farmers are hit by an equally severe drought in 1989 
food shortages will result ullsten said 
we are not talking about the distant future we are talking 
about next year he warned 
while the assembled ecologists were shelled with a barrage of 
environmental warnings organizers said the aim of the conference is 
to work out practical solutions 
we do not want to create a sense of panic here or a stampede 
that would have the consequence of limiting action to a small number 
of countries that have the resources to react said hansjurgen 
karpe of the university of dortmunds institute for environmental 
protection 
but he and others concede a sense of urgency must be instilled in 
the public to counter the greenhouse effect the buildup of 
gases in the atmosphere that swaddle the earth and keep in too much 
of the suns heat 
the us environmental protection agency predicted in a draft 
report issued last month that the warming trend is expected to raise 
the average global temperature by 2 to 4 degrees by the middle of 
the next century 
it also could destroy coastline cut deeply into us crop yields 
and create water and energy crises affecting much of the nation the 
report said 
new measuring equipment pioneered by canadian researchers has 
also disclosed recently that the hole in the earths protective 
ozone layer exposes an area as large as the united states 
that gaping hole in the southern seam of the ozone lays bare the 
unpopulated antarctic region but some scientists fear the northern 
hemisphere is in for a similar breakdown of the barrier that shields 
the earth from the suns cancerthreataning ultraviolet rays 
the antarctic ozone hole is half the world away from canada 
but there is the threat of an arctic ozone hole developing and that 
is close to a lot of canadians said john reid an atmospheric 
scientist from the department of the environment in canada 
the problems their causes and consequences are clear the 
organizers of the hamburg conference say what is needed is a plan 
of action for curbing mankinds polluting habits 
some of the participants such as michael glantz of the national 
center for atmospheric research in boulder colo contend the 
environmental alarms being set off over global warming are 
pressuring societies to act without knowing what action to take or 
whether climatic stability is a desirable objective 
there are always winners and losers even in environmental 
issues glantz said at the opening of the fourday congress 
many of the predictions have positive consequences for some 
countries such as heavier rain in regions that are currently 
plagued by drought he said

editorial boards of the nations newspapers generally faulted the 
presidential campaigns of george bush and michael dukakis as 
negative and uninspiring and many found the candidates equally 
disappointing 
some papers declined to make a presidential endorsement others 
voiced strong reservations even while making their choice 
the morning call of allentown pa called bush a lessthan 
inspired choice but endorsed him anyway on grounds of his 
government experience a view reflected in many editorials 
in dukakis hometown the boston globe said it was endorsing the 
massachusetts democrat despite our uneasiness with his 
leadership style and the lack of focus in his campaign but the 
boston herald referring to its earlier backing of dukakis wrote 
to those both within and outside the state we urge dont make our 
mistake 
some of the sentiment was summed up by the centre daily times of 
state college pa which endorsed dukakis but said neither 
candidate has greatly inspired the electorate with his character 
ideas or vision 
the washington post endorsed no one and called this years race 
a terrible campaign a national disappointment 
the post said it could not in good faith argue for the 
vindication of the cheap shots that have animated george bushs 
campaign or close our eyes to alarming deficiencies of the 
democratic candidate as a prospective president 
the st paul pioneer press dispatch in minnesota endorsed both 
candidates after its eightmember editorial board divided down the 
middle and said when you add up the pluses and the minuses the 
net results dont overwhelmingly favor one or the other 
the new york times said both candidates were better men than had 
been communicated in a sour superficial misleading campaign 
and that america is likely to be well served if either man is 
elected 
the times gave its nod to dukakis based on its expectation that 
he would be the most effective at getting america out of hock 
from its huge deficits 
many newspapers cited bushs experience in washington as a plus 
while others were critical of his selection of sen dan quayle of 
indiana as a running mate and questioned the gop presidential 
nominees ability to tame the deficit 
the starledger of newark nj endorsed bush saying an 
examination of mr bushs long record in federal service reads like 
the curriculum of a preparatory course for the presidency there are 
few areas of policymaking in which he is not experienced 
but the philadelphia daily news said bush has become a candidate 
who takes the lowest road possible who pretends despite all the 
evidence that j danforth quayle is not a callow moron 
its sister newspaper the philadelphia inquirer said bush left 
no notable legacy in his appointive positions and had 
negligible impact on the reagan administration 
dukakis was credited for his leadership record as massachusetts 
governor but critics questioned his personal compassion and his 
credentials on foreign policy and national defense 
the miami herald said bush emerges as a seasoned leader with 
growth potential while mr dukakis is ever the earnest technocrat 
the nation doesnt need an illdefined iceman it needs a 
president 
but the st louis postdispatch said of dukakis what he may 
lack in emotional appeal he more than makes up for in common sense 
compassion and commitment 
connecticuts largest daily the hartford courant said both 
candidates campaigns have been uninspiring and often downright 
disgusting but it endorsed republican bush and welcomed his call 
for a kinder and gentler nation 
we do need a kinder gentler nation said the flint mich 
journal thats why were endorsing michael s dukakis 
the star tribune of minneapolis also gave the nod to dukakis but 
said as this unenlightening presidential campaign nears an end 
it shows ever more vividly its two main shortcomings george bush 
and michael dukakis 
kentuckys two largest newspapers the courierjournal of 
louisville and the lexington heraldleader endorsed dukakis with 
the former voicing concern that on the deficit george bush has 
given no indication that he will rise above the expediency of the 
moment 
the seattle times broke with a long tradition of endorsing 
republican presidential candidates to support dukakis saying bush 
clings to the eightyear reagan legacy and promises he would 
provide four more years of the same this is not reassuring 
the seattle postintelligencer meanwhile backed bush saying 
dukakis lack of emotion and his seeming inability to respond 
either quickly or forcefully to bush attacks on his positions have 
raised legitimate questions about his capacity for timely response 
in time of crisis 
new mexicos largest paper the albuquerque journal expressed 
its confidence in the vice president george bush doesnt really 
need an endorsement the people of new mexico and other mainstream 
states already know the vice president is ready to grasp the reins 
in california the san francisco chronicle and the san francisco 
examiner both backed bush the latter speculating that his 
appointees to the supreme court would not be constitutional 
extremists 
among papers backing bush are the pittsburgh press the 
albuquerque tribune the arizona republic the phoenix gazette the 
times of shreveport la the timespicayune of new orleans the los 
angeles herald examiner the knoxville tenn journal the houston 
chronicle the houston post the dallas morning news the dallas 
times herald the oregonian of portland the new york daily news 
the omaha neb worldherald the chicago tribune the chicago

trial began monday in the lawsuit of a 
woman who was shot and paralyzed by a parolee and is now seeking 4 
million in damages from three state parole board members 
opening arguments began in the suit of former bank executive 
linda grantham 46 of florence who was shot in february 1985 by 
parolee clem jimpson she remains paralyzed from the neck down 
if grantham wins her suit not only the parole board but any 
public official or employee could face farreaching liability in the 
course of their duties deputy attorney general robert gibbs said 
on may 2 the state supreme court ruled that grantham has the 
right to sue the three parole board members who voted for jimpsons 
parole ollie sykes james figgs and paul carter one other member 
voted against parole while a fifth member was not at the meeting 
the supreme court had overturned a 1986 ruling by circuit judge 
william f coleman of hinds county who said members were immune 
under state law because they had acted in their official capacity 
jimpson was paroled from the mississippi state penitentiary at 
parchman on jan 9 1985 after serving 12 years and three months of 
a life sentence for murdering a convenience store clerk 
the lawsuit alleged the board did not review his case properly 
failing to take into account such things as his behavior in prison 
and the nature of his original crime 
jimpson shot grantham at a parking lot of a bank where she was an 
assistant vice president prosecutors said he thought she was 
carrying cash from the bank 
the 60yearold jimpson is serving a sentence of life without 
parole at parchman for shooting grantham 
granthams attorney lisa milner said a victory by her client 
could affect the way criminals are paroled 
i think the outcome if we win will have an effect on the 
process in the future she said problems might not exist if the 
parole board was doing what is required by law she said our 
position is they are not

maurizio gucci an heir of the founder of the 
gucci luxury goods company was convicted of attempted tax fraud 
monday and given a 750 fine and a oneyear suspended sentence 
vittorio ajello the lawyer for gucci said the decision means 
gucci will regain control of shares that will give him half of the 
company 
gucci was accused of having arranged the falsification of the 
signature on the documents to avoid paying inheritance taxes by 
making it appear that his father rodolfo transferred ownership of 
the shares before his death in 1983 
guccis ownership of the shares was not in question only when 
the transfer was made the court froze the shares to assure he could 
pay any fine levied in the tax fraud case 
he had faced a possible penalty of three years in jail and a fine 
of about 23 million 
however the court fined gucci only 750 it also gave him a 
oneyear suspended sentence and said his criminal record will be 
expunged at the end of the year gucci also must pay the inheritance 
tax on the shares 
the court also convicted gucci employees gian vittorio pilone and 
ciro de vincenzo the notary that authenticated the signatures of 
the same charges the two were given the same suspended sentence and 
fine the court also prohibited de vincenzo from acting as a notary 
for one year 
the court also acquitted four others including a woman accused 
of actually signing the documents 
gucci is the great grandson of guccio gucci who founded the 
company in 1922 the company has 180 stores worldwide and its sales 
last year totaled 170 million

president reagan took his last 
sentimental bow on the campaign stage monday with a plea for 
california voters to assure a new beginning for america by 
tipping the balance in favor of republican presidential nominee 
george bush 
in speeches delivered alongside the retired ocean liner queen 
mary at long beach and at a rally near san diegos performing arts 
center reagan saluted old friends freedom fighters and 
political prisoners and paid a rare public tribute to his parents 
so now we come to the end of this last campaign and i just 
hope that nelle and jack are looking down on us right now and 
nodding their heads and saying their boy did them proud reagan 
said 
likewise he told his listeners he hoped they would tell their 
children and grandchildren that a certain president came to town 
at the end of a long journey and that a century of peace 
prosperity opportunity and hope followed 
climaxing 25000 miles of travel to 16 states on bushs behalf 
the president stressed that california with its 47 electoral votes 
could provide the margin of victory for the gop ticket in tuesdays 
election recent polls show bush and dukakis have fought virtually 
to a draw in the nations most populous state 
today of course is the last day of this my last campaign as 
president he said in long beach but tomorrow launches a new 
beginning for america 
your votes tomorrow may be the most important ones cast in 
america they will determine how california goes and california may 
send the next president to the white house 
reagan was returning monday night to the white house where he 
will watch election returns tuesday night with friends and political 
advisers aides said bush was expected to meet with reagan there 
wednesday 
on his arrival at long beach reporters asked reagan what the 
polls were telling him the president grinned and replied im 
going to wait and see what that last poll tells me tomorrow 
asked if he had a hunch about the outcome he replied im 
afraid to say what it is im superstitious 
although the bush campaign clearly expected reagan to provide a 
crucial boost in california his speech indicated that his reasons 
for making the 14hour round trip between washington and the west 
coast on election eve were as much personal as political 
im not doing this just for george bush he told gop 
stalwarts in san diego in his most personal and introspective speech 
in years im doing it for the country of course but for someone 
else as well actually for two other people 
reagan has inserted references to his mother in a few speeches 
recently but he has hardly ever spoken publicly of his father an 
alcoholic shoe salesman whom he described monday as the best 
storyteller ive ever heard and the strongest man of principle 
ive ever known 
the president said jack reagan once nearly caught pneumonia 
sleeping in his car instead of taking a room in the only hotel in 
town because it discriminated against certain groups of people 
he said that even in the darkest days of the depression his 
parents never refused a meal to anyone who knocked on their door 
so you see im also campaigning this year for them reagan 
said a son of jack and nelle reagan never walked away from a 
battle on principle this years election is that kind of fight and 
by darn were going to win it 
at the getoutthevote rally in san diego reagan sounded a bit 
wistful when he noted that his name wont be on the ballot tuesday 
but he said that didnt matter because something more important is 
a principle a legacy 
he added no this is not the end of an era it is a time to 
refresh and strengthen the new beginning we started eight years 
ago 
he said the importance of tuesdays balloting extended far beyond 
us shores 
tomorrow on the plains of afghanistan and in jungles around the 
world freedom fighters will huddle close to their radios hoping to 
catch word that the administration in america will remain their 
friend he said 
in cells across the globe political prisoners will wait 
anxiously for assurance that america has chosen strength over 
weakness because for many of them our strength is all that keeps 
their hopes alive and so help me god we wont let them down 
reagan said

meaning god is great as he stabbed the soldier said settlers 
at the massua cooperative farm 26 miles northeast of jerusalem 
army spokesmen confirmed a palestinian woman was shot to death in 
a west bank village 
arab sources said 21 palestinians were wounded by soldiers in the 
west bank and gaza strip where a revolt against israeli occupation 
began dec 8 1987 among the 15 million palestinian residents 
hospital officials said two 9yearolds were among the wounded 
one shot in the leg and the other in the chest 
a military court in the gaza strip sentenced the leader of a 
guerrilla squad to three consecutive life prison terms for murdering 
three other palestinians suspected of collaborating with israel a

chair and threatened him ms benami said the farmer didnt have 
a choice he shot him

palestinians papers said he was ahmad hussein abdullah basharat of 
tamoun village near jenin

a california firm agreed monday to pay a 
50000 fine and stop transmitting obscene messages on interstate 
telephone lines in a case which the government said signals all 
dialaporn services that they must act to keep their material 
inaccessible to children 
audio enterprises inc of mill valley calif and operator 
wendy king signed the agreement entailing one the first dialaporn 
fines imposed by the federal communications commission 
the 50000 payment that the dialaporn operator will have to 
pay to the government shows that there will be a high price 
attached to failure to obey the law scrupulously in this important 
area said gerald brock head of the fccs common carrier bureau 
this sends a signal there are some teeth in the law brock 
said enforcement of the civil penalty was done quickly and 
efficiently compared with the alternative of extensive and costly 
litigation he said 
fcc officials said audio enterprises is effectively out of 
business there was no current listing for the company in telephone 
information 
to resume operations king or audio enterprises must tone down 
the messages and use access codes credit cards or scrambling 
equipment to prevent children under 18 from dialing such operations 
will be monitored by the fcc according to the agreement 
the fcc launched its investigation of audio enterprises after a 
mother in california wrote that her 13yearold son and his friends 
spent 74 dialing a paytolisten 900number for 211 minutes 
also listening was the womans daughter who was later molested 
by two boys who had heard the tapes the woman wrote this phone 
call has damaged our lives the woman wrote 
the fcc informed audio enterprises last december that it was in 
apparent violation of fccs rules that require companies to restrict 
access of obscene material the commission also informed intercambio 
inc of san jose calif that it was in violation of the law and 
that case is still pending 
the fcc determined the material broadcast by the two companies 
was obscene under a supreme courts test material is obscene if it 
depicts sexual acts in a patently offensive way appeals to the 
prurient interest of an average person and lacks serious literary or 
artistic value 
fcc officials estimated audio enterprises collected about 
250000 in revenues over a twoyear period 
altogether the dialaporn industry produces about 54 million 
annually in revenue for providers and phone companies according to 
the information industry bulletin 
the fcc has referred some complaints to the justice department 
in may 1987 two dialaporn providers pleaded guilty to failing to 
comply with the commissions rule the court fined them each 50000 
earlier this year congress passed a sweeping dialaporn law 
that bans obscene and indecent commercial messages the law has not 
been enforced because of legal challenges in new york and california 
the principal issue centers around the definition of indecent 
material the fcc deems material indecent if it depicts or describes 
sexual or excretory organs or activities in a patently offensive 
way the dialaporn industry says the definition is too broad and 
unconstitutional 
congress passed another measure last month but it has not been 
signed yet by president reagan

congressional investigators on monday faulted 
the state department for failing to update security checks on 
thousands of longterm department employees who have access to top 
secret information 
the department has not reinvestigated about 75 percent of its 
9000 longterm employees in criticalsensitive positions those who 
had been working with the department for five or more years the 
general accounting office said 
the number of people not reinvestigated after five years was 
6739 according to the gao which is the investigative arm of 
congress 
about 44 percent of those eligible have not been reinvestigated 
in the past 10 years or longer and dozens of employees have not 
been reinvestigated in 25 years or more the gao said the number 
not reinvestigated after 10 years was 3908 
rep jack brooks dtexas who requested the study said just 
because an individual was a good security risk five years ago 
doesnt mean he still is 
as espionage cases of the past few years have clearly 
demonstrated us government employees with security clearances and 
access to classified information are prime targets for recruitment 
by foreign intelligence operatives brooks said 
state department officials said they had no comment on the report 
state department security investigators devote most of their 
energy to people seeking employment and were failing to meet their 
own goal of completing such reviews within 90 days 
the state department took an average of 140 days for such 
preemployment investigations the gao said 
a major reason for the accumulated backlog is the low priority 
the department has given reinvestigations the report said 
state has not focused on reinvestigations but instead has used its 
investigative resources primarily on suitability reviews which 
are used to reduce the number of applicants for foreign service 
positions 
in essence state has been giving a higher priority to 
investigating a large number of people who will never be hired 
rather than to investigating people already in sensitive jobs it 
said 
among the employees the gao said the state department failed to 
investigate as required after five years were 
a science officer who had top secret clearance to nato matters 
and to coding information violated department regulations in 1982 by 
traveling to a soviet bloc country without authorization also in 
1982 while the employee was assigned to a post in the soviet union 
the kgb learned of his homosexual orientation and threatening 
disclosure sought to recruit him as a spy no reinvestigation was 
ever done on this employee his clearances were pulled after he 
allegedly engaged in a homosexual encounter with a minor 
an economic affairs officer hired in 1973 was criticized for 
violating security procedures in 1979 for leaving classified 
material unattended on his desk he also violated department 
policies by having affairs with soviet and czechoslovak women the 
employees security clearance was not lifted until he was arrested 
by the drug enforcement administration in january 1986 for allegedly 
trying to manufacture the illegal drug lsd 
an employee who received a security clearance in 1980 had his 
clearance suspended after he sired a child by an east german woman 
he had not been reinvestigated as required in 1985

with the blessings of a bishop and the 
salutes of nearly 1000 police officers the city buried a police 
recuit monday who died 44 days after collapsing on his first day of 
training a session that sparked turmoil in the states law 
enforcement agencies 
hundreds of residents unable to get in the packed 1500seat 
church lined both sides of the main street outside st josephs 
church as the most rev joseph maguire roman catholic bishop of 
springfield said the funeral mass for 25yearold timothy shepard 
timothy did not quite realize his desire to be a police 
officer but perhaps in gods mysterious plan he may have had a 
higher role the bishop said 
shepards illness and the hospitalization of 15 other cadets in 
late september led to at least three state probes the resignation 
of the head of the states police training programs and the 
transfer of state police instructors and the director of the agawam 
academy where the cadet collapsed 
the service was broadcast on loudspeakers and there was 
bitterness and sadness on the faces of the residents who stood in 
the chilly november drizzle for more than two hours 
many residents such as irene kibbee had not known the young 
man who was married in june and whose wife is pregnant but they 
knew he was the most seriously stricken of the cadets who were 
hospitalized with exhaustion and dehydration following a grueling 
regimen of laps and pushups on a few cups of water 
its so senseless what did they think they were doing with 
that training mrs kibbee said your heart cant help but go 
out to that poor boys family 
pittsfield police officer anthony riello said shepards death has 
created ambivalence in the force about training methods 
the mood in the department is extremely sullen he said 
the problem we have in dealing with it shepards death is that 
it is so senseless it shouldnt have happened 
the last pittsfield officer to die in the line of duty was killed 
in 1898 while pushing a woman and her children to safety off the 
tracks of an oncoming train 
the funeral cortege the largest ever in this city of 50000 
people took nearly 15 minutes to pass two pittsfield police 
cruisers led the way followed by motorcycle officers mounted 
police and more than 100 cruisers from nantucket to schnectady ny 
their lights flashed in a sea of twinkling blue and red as they 
slowly passed the silent crowd 
state police were represented by three cruisers they had scaled 
back plans for six cruisers when shepards family asked that they 
not attend because of bitterness over his training by state 
troopers the family withdrew the request sunday according to mayor 
anne everest wojtkowski 
they reconsidered and agreed that there are many fine and 
compassionate state policemen and they should be made welcome she 
said 
shepard collapsed sept 19 from heat stroke and was flown to a 
pittsburgh hospital while still in a coma for a liver transplant 
the cadet had emerged from a coma after two weeks and was slowly 
recovering even writing his wife i made it when he fell 
unconscious again oct 31 and was rushed into emergency surgery to 
remove a blood clot on his brain 
he was pronounced dead wednesday an autopsy indicated he died 
from infections that set in because of his weakened condition 
his death is the subject of an inquest later this month to 
determine whether criminal charges should be brought against the 
instructors

americans took out 188 billion more in 
consumer debt than they paid off in september the smallest advance 
in 10 months the government reported monday 
the federal reserve said that the september increase in consumer 
debt was down from an august rise of 532 billion and was the 
smallest monthly advance since a 179 billion rise in november 1987 
while much of the decline in september was traced to weak auto 
sales economists said that the pattern of the past several months 
showed that consumers had grown more cautious in their buying plans 
from july through september consumer debt rose at an annual rate 
of 675 percent down significantly from a 102 percent growth rate 
in the first six months of the year 
consumer debt in the third quarter grew at one of the slowest 
rates of this recovery said michael evans head of a washington 
forecasting firm there are increasing signs that consumers are 
becoming more cautious as they cut back on spending and try to 
reduce their debt loads 
consumer spending accounts for twothirds of all economic 
activity evans said the consumer slowdown is a primary reason he is 
looking for economic growth next year to be less than half of this 
years pace 
the overall economy as measured by the gross national product 
is expected to rise by 38 percent this year the best performance 
since 1984 evans predicted 1989 growth would be a lackluster 2 
percent 
for september auto loans edged up a modest 49 million following 
a 22 billion increase in august the big drop in auto loans 
reflected the absence of widespread auto sales incentive programs 
the government said these programs to reduce swollen inventories 
had boosted sales in the three previous years 
the category which includes credit card debt rose by 15 billion 
in september down from a 26 billion august increase 
bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate edged up 
342 million compared to an august increase of 449 million while 
loans for mobile homes actually fell by 29 million following a 33 
million increase in august 
the various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally 
adjusted 6552 billion in september total consumer debt was 86 
percent higher than a year ago

lebanese hijacking suspect fawaz younis was 
identified in court monday by an american college student as the 
leader of a horde of men who seized a jordanian jetliner at the 
beirut airport in 1985 
i recognize him as the leader of the hijackers william l 
slade testified pointing his finger at the bearded blackhaired 
defendant seated in the courtroom 
how sure are you about that asked justice department 
prosecutor karen morrissette 
positive replied slade the first victim of the hijacking to 
publicly identify younis as leader of the group of five men who 
stormed the royal jordanian airliner with ak47 assault rifles on 
june 11 1985 
the 21yearold witness testifying at a pretrial hearing in 
us district court said he saw younis emerge from the cockpit 10 
times during twoday hijacking when the boeing 727 jet was forced to 
fly to several points in the mediterranean before returning to 
beirut 
i shook his hand at the end of the ordeal slade said 
recalling he looked the hijacker in the eye as he was leaving the 
aircraft i was very close to him 
the plane was blown up at beirut airport shortly after the the 72 
passengers and crew members were allowed to leave it 
the aircraft was seized as it prepared to take off for amman 
jordan 
about two minutes before takeoff i heard a great deal of 
gunfire outside the aircraft slade testified a whole horde of 
men stormed onto the airplane 
my gut instinct was to duck i crouched into my chair he 
recalled the group started beating everything in their way onto 
the floor 
all of the hijackers except their leader attacked a group of 
five or six jordanian sky marshals and proceeded to beat them 
thoroughly and torture them he said 
slade testified that the hijackers leader spent most of the time 
in the airplanes cockpit but came back to the passenger cabin about 
10 times mostly to order his men to stop beating the sky marshals 
when he returned to the cockpit the hijackers would start 
laughing and begin doing it again none of the passengers was ever 
beaten or threatened with violence slade said 
slade testified that he identified a photograph of the defendant 
that was shown to him by an fbi agent in june 1987 three months 
before fbi agents arrested younis aboard a governmentchartered 
yacht off cyprus 
younis who is awaiting trial on hijacking charges was lured to 
the yacht by the prospect of completing a drug deal 
the man slade identified as the leader of the hijackers was 
dressed in a flak jacket with a black headband around his head 
and wore green pants 
the defendant was heavily armed and wore a vest that 
contained ammunition clips as well as hand grenades slade said 
slade said he could tell the man was the leader of the group 
because he stayed mostly in the cockpit and was the only hijacker 
who carried a twoway radio 
judge barrington d parker called the hearing to determine 
whether the eyewitness identification of younis by slade and five 
other witnesses can be admitted into evidence 
the trial had been scheduled to begin nov 14 but has been 
postponed indefinitely while prosecutors appeal a pretrial order by 
the judge prosecutors want to challenge a ruling by parker that 
they produce classified documents and tape recordings of 
conversations between younis and an fbi informant that parker ruled 
the defense was entitled to inspect 
a federal appeals court is not expected to consider the issue 
until january so the trial is not expected to begin until late 
winter at the earliest 
slade a college student testified he was traveling with his 
father landry slade a former professor at the american university 
in beirut when the plane was hijacked the elder slade is also 
expected to testify at the hearing which is expected to last 
several days 
slade a college student declined to say exactly where he lived 
saying id rather not reveal that right now 
but he reluctantly confirmed during crossexamination by defense 
lawyer francis d carter that he lived in south carolina

north had fabricated documents to hide from investigators the fact 
that arms dealer richard v secord had paid for the installation of 
a 13800 security fence outside norths home in suburban great

the soviet decision to suspend its military 
withdrawal from afghanistan does not violate the unmediated 
geneva accord the chief un spokesman said monday 
the geneva agreements are being implemented at the moment 
there is no violation of the agreement francois giuliani 
spokesman for secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar told 
reporters 
he was asked at the regular daily briefing whether perez de 
cuellar had any comment on the soviet announcement friday that it 
was suspending withdrawal because of pakistani and us aid to 
afghan guerrillas 
giuliani said there is no comment because under the geneva 
agreements that is envisaged 
asked to explain he said what is envisaged is that troops 
be withdrawn by the 15th of february 1989 and that half of them be 
withdrawn by the 15th of august and this has been done 
they have said they are suspending their troop withdrawal 
giuliani said that is not a violation of the geneva agreements 
the geneva agreements are being implemented at the moment 
there is no violation of the agreement 
in its announcement friday the soviet union said it still hopes 
to have its troops out by feb 15 
moslem insurgents began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 an 
estimated 115000 were in the country when the withdrawal began last 
may 15 
when asked about a statement by the soviet ambassador to 
afghanistan that the supply of arms to guerrillas by the united 
states and pakistan practically torpedoes the accords he 
replied 
the secretarygeneral hopes and is confident that the geneva 
agreements would be implemented 
in an interview published monday foreign minister abdul wakil of 
afghanistan demanded a halt in us and pakistani aid to the moslem 
insurgents 
bakhtar the official afghan news agency quoted him as saying 
we have stated on more than one occasion that afghanistan will 
not remain indifferent to the incessant violations of the geneva 
accords a joint sovietafghan decision to suspend the withdrawal of 
soviet troops from afghanistan was a response to it the 
opposition must stop the armed struggle 
he said new heavier weapons brought in by the soviets were for 
defensive purposes intended not for threatening anyone but for 
suppressing the hotbeds of resistance of the armed opposition 
sophisticated mig27 groundattack jets and ss1 scud missiles 
have been sighted in afghanistan the united states says their 
presence raises questions of whether moscow intends to comply with 
the geneva withdrawal agreement 
giuliani said perez de cuellar had not yet read the text of 
statement the soviet foreign ministry issued friday the soviet 
union has criticized the 50man un observer force sent to monitor 
the withdrawal and investigate possible violations by either side 
the soviets have asked for a report on the work of the observers 
who the kremlin says are not doing their job 
the agreement signed in geneva in april by afghanistan and 
pakistan with the united states and soviet union as guarantors 
provides for troop withdrawal and noninterference in internal 
affairs the guerrillas were not a party to the negotiations and 
continued to fight 
moscow says the arming of insurgents by pakistan and the united 
states violates the agreement washington says the soviets violated 
it by providing more arms to the afghan army and introducing the new 
weapons

iran and iraq met for five hours monday in their 
longest facetoface session since peace negotiations began aug 25 
but the iranian delegate described it as long talks no progress 
un mediator jan eliasson described the encounter between ali 
akbar velayati and tariq aziz foreign ministers of iran and iraq 
respectively as a helpful meeting in a businesslike 
atmosphere he said another session would be held tuesday 
aziz said he would send a letter to secretarygeneral javier 
perez de cuellar calling his attention to a statement by the 
commander of the iranian guards who he said had urged that 
reinforcements be sent to the front he did not identify the 
commander 
we feel this statement is a very grave one aziz said i 
made it clear to the iranian and the un delegations that if the 
iranian side is using any threats nobody is afraid 
iran and iraq went to war in september 1980 and at least 15 
million people were killed or wounded before a ceasefire began aug 
20 
aziz said iraq had not reinforced its positions on the 730mile 
border front but had new weapons to use against external 
aggression un observers are stationed between the two armies 
along the border 
velayati told reporters negotiations remained stuck on point one 
of security council resolution 598 which covers withdrawal of 
forces to internationally recognized borders the ceasefire 
resolution also provides for prisoner exchange and peace 
negotiations 
in an interview with irans official islamic republic news 
agency velayati said no iranian troops were left on iraqi territory 
but iraqi forces occupy nearly 400 square miles of iranian land 
the southern border is the most contentious issue because it 
falls in the disputed shattalarab iraqs only outlet to the sea 
just before the war started iraq repudiated a 1975 treaty that 
draws the line down the middle of the waterway it wants the line 
returned to the iranian shore as it was before the treaty 
iran considers the treaty still valid 
perez de cuellar offered a compromise last month calling for 
military disengagement and exchange of the estimated 100000 
prisoners combined with dredging of the shattalarab and an 
iranian pledge to stop searching ships in the persian gulf for 
warrelated cargo 
the waterway which iran calls the arvan river is blocked by 
ships stranded by the war unexploded shells and silt that collected 
during eight years 
an irna dispatch from geneva quoted velayati as saying the un 
mediators must produce new ideas if they want the talks to move 
ahead and out of the current relative deadlock

fereentardenois france ap peace talks among cambodian 
factions made no substantial progress monday but the leaders agreed 
to meet again and to establish a working committee of their 
representatives officials reported 
the talks in this village 70 miles east of paris are to end 
tuesday 
attending the conference are neutralist prince norodom sihanouk 
leader of a loose alliance of three resistance groups fighting the 
vietnameseinstalled cambodian government anticommunist son sann 
and communist premier hun sen of cambodia 
the fourth cambodian faction the communist khmer rouge had been 
invited but the three other leaders rejected the khmer rouges 
proposed envoy ok saukun who is cambodias ambassador to the un 
educational scientific and cultural organization they said he was 
not qualified for a summit meeting 
the three agreed to meet again in france early next year 
the resistance groups fighting the government are sihanouks 
supporters son sanns guerrillas and the khmer rouge 
prince norodom ranariddh sihanouks son and spokesman said hun 
sens position had hardened he said the cambodian government wanted 
to link the withdrawal of vietnamese troops to an end to foreign aid 
to the resistance groups 
son sann and sihanouk said the withdrawal of vietnams military 
forces from cambodia must take place before any aid to the 
resistance is ended 
it is unacceptable to put the foreign occupation of cambodia 
and the just resistance of the people on the same level ranariddh 
told reporters we will not compromise 
another main point of disagreement is the dismantling of the 
cambodian regime it was installed by the vietnamese after they 
invaded cambodia in decemer 1978 and ousted the khmer rouge that had 
defeated the usbacked government in 1975 at the end of the 
indochinese war hundreds of thousands of cambodians perished during 
the brutal khmer rouge effort to destroy all opposition and create a 
rural society 
sihanouk is demanding the hun sen government be replaced by a 
fourparty administration hun sen has indicated the status quo be 
maintained until free and democratic elections can be held 
sihanouk and son sann believe that no agreement will work that 
leaves out the khmer rouge which has the strongest military force 
in the resistance hun sens position is that the khmer rouge must 
first be disarmed to avoid another civil war 
on these essential points divergences remain said ranariddh

a powerful earthquake struck just inside chinas 
mountainous southern border and two official radio stations 
reported monday that 600 people were killed 
radio beijing and the peoples central broadcasting station 
quoted the same reporter hu jiaqi about the death toll radio 
beijing also quoted him as saying most of the dead were in shanmato 
a village in yunnan province that was nearly wiped out by the 
earthquake which registered 76 on the richter scale 
hus account could not be confirmed independently an earlier 
radio beijing report said total casualties were 600 including dead 
and injured 
the state seismology bureau in beijing which had reported 18 
killed and 54 injured said it had no new figures dispatches from 
the official news agency xinhua said at least 37 people were dead 
and more than 100 injured 
no telephone service was available to the affected part of yunnan 
province near the burmese border it is sparsely inhabited by 
farmers many from the lahu and va minorities with their own 
languages and live in houses of wood and mud 
a yunnan official reached by telephone said the provincial 
government had no idea how many people were killed asked whether 
600 was a plausible he said it might be it might not be 
if the death toll of 600 is accurate this would be chinas worst 
earthquake since the 1976 tremor that hit the northeastern city of 
tangshan officials say 242000 died but unofficial estimates put 
the death toll as high as 800000 
that quake measured 78 to 82 on the richter scale a gauge of 
the energy released by an earthquake each number on the scale 
indicates a tenfold increase in strength and a temblor of 7 can 
cause heavy damage in populated areas 
following sundays quake the state seismology bureau said dozens 
of aftershocks had struck the yunnan region through monday night 
with the strongst measuring 72 but most ranging from 40 to 60 
roads to the affected area were cut and yunnan authorities 
ordered an airlift of food medicine and other relief supplies the 
provincial government said early tuesday that doctors had set out 
for the area and the governor he zhiqiang was en route 
xinhua said the national communist party central committee 
ordered a delegation led by state councilor song jian to visit the 
site and oversee rescue work it said premier li peng issued a 
statement expressing sympathy and concern for victims and their 
families 
the quake was centered in yunnans lancang and menglian counties 
about 240 miles southwest of the provincial capital kunming xinhua 
said most houses in the two counties were demolished and buildings 
were destroyed in 14 surrounding counties 
roads to the region were cut but crews were working to repair 
them the agency said 
a journalist who has visited the region said many homes were 
built on stilts because of periodic heavy rains and probably would 
collapse in such a strong earthquake 
seismologists in kunming reported no damage in the city of 15 
million three years ago a quake of 63 on the richter scale killed 
22 people and injured 300 in kunming 
a quake of 50 occured oct 15 in southern yunnan which 
experiences tremors frequently but there were no reports of 
casualties a powerful temblor hit far western china on saturday and 
seismologists said they did not know whether the yunnan quake was 
related to it 
the saturday tremor measuring 70 on the richter scale was 
centered in an uninhabited area of the tanggula mountains in western 
qinghai province and northern tibet officials in qinghai said they 
had no reports of casualties 
china is one of the most earthquakeprone countries and 
seismologists predicted in 1985 that activity would increase through 
the end of the century the last major quake was on aug 23 1985 
when a temblor of 74 killed 71 people and injured 125 in the 
farwestern xinjiang uygur autonomous region

black leaders expressed confidence monday that 
blacks would turn out to vote in large numbers despite a 
presidential campaign widely regarded as lackluster 
they predicted getoutthevote efforts by democrat jesse 
jackson black churches and other organizations will produce a 
tunout as large or nearly as large as in 1984 when blacks turned 
out in record numbers 
many analysts are predicting the overall turnout tuesday will be 
less than the 53 percent of american adults who cast their ballots 
in 1984 and some believe blacks will not turn out for dukakis as 
strongly as they did for walter mondale who got 90 percent of the 
black vote in 1984 
blacks make up 111 percent of the adult population and have 
voted overwhelmingly democratic since the new deal 
curtis gans executive director of the committee for the study of 
the american electorate said registration is down among blacks and 
i cant conceive of black turnout not being lower than in 84 
stephen hess a senior fellow at the brookings institution said 
black voters in 1984 had a feeling of affection for walter 
mondale i dont see that they feel that way for michael 
dukakis he said he was the fellow who beat their man 
jackson 
many jackson supporters were upset last july when dukakis failed 
to notify jackson beforehand that he had chosen lloyd bentsen of 
texas for his running mate 
but jackson has crisscrossed the country on behalf of the 
dukakisbentsen ticket logging 55700 miles and addressing 745000 
people in 191 events in 29 states according to frank watkins a 
jackson spokesman 
john e jacob president of the national urban league said i 
think jesse has done everything he could to say to black america 
that he is not mad about that and even if he were that the states 
are still too high for that to be a reason for blacks not going to 
the polls 
jacob predicted the black vote will be at least as large as it 
was in 1984 there has been a tremendous amount of work going on 
around the country on the part of the black infrastructure black 
churches black community organizations that is not getting 
visible media attention he said 
the rev benjamin l hooks executive director of the naacp 
said weve had a fairly unexciting campaign in turning people on 
to vote 
there was a period when many black people felt let down said 
hooks but he added that grassroots getoutthevote efforts and 
jacksons constant campaigning have turned that around 
i think that black voter turnout will be substantial but 
perhaps not as large as it could have been had there been more 
coverage of issues and of jesse jackson said hooks he predicted 
it would be very close to the 84 turnout 
hooks said that in states with significant black populations 
wherever dukakis is running a tight race with bush in the white 
community black voters could be the deciding factor 
pollster gordon s black said his organization which conducts 
polls for usa today and cable news network found no evidence in its 
final preelection survey of any likely drop in black turnout 
after interviewing nearly 700 blacks in a survey group of 6613 
black said we have absolutely no evidence that theres a black 
turnout drop at all

questions about safety and drug use 
linger at the usx corp fairless works where last month a crane 
operator suffocated after a plunge into a bin of ironore pellets 
the size of jelly beans 
the bucks county district attorneys office and us occupational 
safety and health adminstration are investigating the oct 2 death 
of rb townsend 52 of levittown 
usx reportedly hired nine undercover agents to probe alleged drug 
use at the suburban philadelphia plant 
stanley g martin has testified he pressed the button that 
dropped townsend into a funnel filled with the ironore pellets the 
funnel opens from the bottom into a car that transfers ore to a 
blastfurnace bin 
martin 28 had been on the job just four days at the time of the 
accident 
its not a whodunit district attorney alan rubenstein said 
we know how it happened and who was responsible the only question 
that remains is is it criminal 
the answer depends on whether illegal drugs contributed directly 
to the fatality 
a test found trace amounts of cocaine and marijuana in martin 
three hours after the accident too little to prove he was 
criminally impaired rubenstein said a second review of the test 
results is under way 
martin contends the fatality was simply a horrible accident 
caused by a confusing situation in an unfamiliar environment he had 
only had two hours of supervised training for the job 
townsend had stepped from his cab to clean the windows standing 
on ironore pellets to reach the glass usx announced in a statement 
the day after the accident he had asked martin who operated the 
transfer cars not to dump the funnel until he was finished the 
philadelphia inquirer said in monday editions 
the newspaper said martin testified during dismissal hearings 
that he either forgot or misunderstood the request 
tom farrell a spokesman for usx declined comment monday on the 
nature of the dismissal hearings or whether martin is still employed 
at fairless works 
were basically taking a pass on all this questioning because 
we have an ongoing investigation there farrell said 
according to the inquirer martin checked yes on an 
application when asked if he had ever used drugs the form then 
asked what kind martin wrote pot 
osha will determine whether usx management was responsible for 
the fatality said ed skladitis director of the philadelphiaarea 
osha office 
the questions the agency will answer include whether usx hired a 
man who should have been rejected whether he received proper 
training and whether safe procedures existed for the window cleaning 
osha has the power to levy fines when it finds negligence 
since the death the company has given crane operators 
instructions on how to clean their cabs safely and has issued 
padlocks to lock the bottom of the funnel before windows are cleaned 
farrell said usx has an ongoing safety program at fairless and 
changes are made whenever investigation of an accident determines a 
cause that can be remedied

a communistled mass organization 
said monday the president of the slovenian republic should be 
punished for allegedly antiserbian statements he made on a visit to 
the united states 
action against janez stanovnik should be taken by the nations 
highest ruling bodies the collective federal presidency and the 
communist party presidium said a statement from the belgrade 
socialist alliance carried by the official news ageny tanjug 
in remarks last wednesday to the national press club in 
washington stanovnik said protests inspired by inflation and 
serbian nationalism a month ago had threatened the stability of 
yugoslavia 
mass rallies in serbia the nations largest republic involved 
hundreds of thousands of people supporting serbian party chief 
slobodan milosevics campaign for more control over kosovo and 
vojvodina two largely autonomous provinces that are part of serbia 
the belgrade socialist alliance which is strongly influenced by 
milosevics policies said stanovnik misinformed the american public 
and his views differed from reality belgrade is the capital of 
both serbia and yugoslavia 
stanovnik said in washington the possibility of ethnic 
disturbances crossing into the republic of bosniahercegovina a 
fragile mixture of moslem catholic and christian orthodox faiths 
prompted him and leaders of other republics to act through the 
national party on matters normally reserved for regional authorities 
he said the crisis had been eased by events that included 
decisions by the national communist party central committee late 
last month 
two weeks ago you would have asked when does the civil war 
come stanovnik said in the united states he had gone there on a 
private visit to his son in philadelphia 
a critical commentary published sunday by the belgrade daily 
politika which is controlled by milosevics group said stanovnik 
disinformed the international public about events in his own 
country frightening it with imaginary serbian nationalism 
tanjug quoted the belgrade socialist alliance as saying it would 
demand that the presidency of yugoslavia and the communist party 
presidium adopt an official stand on the statements made by the 
president of slovenia janez stanovnik in the united states

nicaraguan guerrillas will demand 
that the us presidentelect quickly reveal whether he will support 
their struggle to overthrow the sandinista government a rebel 
leader said monday 
wilfredo montalvan a member of the directorate of the rebels 
nicaraguan resistance organization also said the rebels hope to 
obtain renewed us military aid if vice president george bush is 
elected president on tuesday 
we will meet with the transition team of the new us 
president and demand a clear definition over nicaragua montalvan 
said by telephone from miami 
the rightwing rebels known as contras want to determine if 
the new government of either bush or democratic candidate michael 
dukakis will continue to support the war to defeat once and for all 
the sandinista government he said 
the reagan administration has backed the rebels known as 
contras since 1981 in their bid to overthrow the leftist 
sandinistas the majority of the contras fled nicaragua in recent 
months to honduras after us military aid expired in february 
the contras currently are drawing from a 27 million humanitarian 
aid package approved by the us congress 
montalvan said the contras would reject us military aid if it 
is provided only to pressure the sandinista government into making 
democratic reforms 
we cannot allow our people to continue to sacrifice themselves 
just to keep pressure on the sandinistas that is immoral he said 
the sandinistas and rebels signed a ceasefire pact in march 
president daniel ortega has extended the ceasefire on a monthly 
basis through the end of november while the contras say the 
ceasefire is indefinite 
each side accuses the other of truce violations talks on a 
permanent truce stalemated in september

foreign ministers of member nations of the organization of american 
states meet there nov 15

tens of thousands of civil servants struck for one 
day monday to protest dismissal of union workers at an intelligence 
headquarters disrupting such government offices as welfare and 
drivingtest centers 
neil kinnock leader of the opposition labor party told a mass 
rally of civil servants in london we believe that solidarity 
like liberty must be indivisible and we believe that solidarity 
like charity begins at home 
the rally was one of about 60 held to protest the firings of five 
men at the government communications headquarters a huge facility 
at cheltenham in southwest england that monitors transmissions from 
the soviet union prime minister margaret thatcher says its work is 
too sensitive to risk disruption by strikes 
in london kinnock greeted 2500 civil servants in polish and 
said i do it in that way because we have solidarity with the 
belief that the freedoms of organization assembly and expression 
must know no boundaries 
we dont just want freedom in gdansk we want it in gchq we 
dont just want dialogue and freedom to choose in poland we want it 
in cheltenham 
mrs thatcher visited poland last week and met with lech walesa 
founder of the outlawed independent union movement solidarity 
after labor made the comparison again later monday in 
parliament civil service minister richard luce responded dont 
you understand the difference between true democracy with freedom 
under the law with a freely elected parliament 
national security has to come first and the gchq needs to 
operate on a continuous basis if they are to be effective 
the five men were fired for flouting a 1984 ban on unions at the 
facility twelve other men face retirement compulsory transfer or 
dismissal 
they were the holdouts among onethird of the 7000 employees who 
were union members in 1984 others accepted payment of 1000 pounds 
each then worth 1400 for quitting their union 
none of the rebels was fired until this year but union officials 
said the government tried to freeze them out with such tactics as 
refusing pay raises 
the council of civil service unions an umbrella for britains 
eight civil service unions said 80 percentplus walkouts closed 
many employment and welfare offices staterun job and drivingtest 
centers 
civil servants also walked off jobs in customs offices prisons 
airports and magistrate courts and spokeswoman anne kenefeck said

fort wayne ind a sen dan quayle finally at home in 
his native indiana got a heros welcome monday night as he 
concluded an occasionally rocky campaign for the vice presidency 
in a boisterous rally that took on the flavor of a political 
convention quayle thanked a crowd of about 2000 for supporting 
him through times of tribulation 
there have been weeks of wild exhilaration along with personal 
testing and we knew you were there quayle said without 
referring specifically to the controversy that swirled about him in 
the days following his aug 17 nomination by the republican national 
convention to be george bushs running mate 
my fellow hoosiers i am finally at home he said it is 
here with your help that i entered public service 
quayle had been besieged by questions from news organizations 
about the circumstances surrounding his enlistment in the indiana 
national guard at the height of the vietnam war in 1969 and the 
question of whether he benefited by undue influence in getting 
admitted into the indiana university law school with a c average 
on undergraduate work at depauw university 
earlier quayle said americans must say good night to 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis if they want to 
save the changes wrought during president reagans eight years in 
office 
during a rally at an aiport hangar in roanoke va nestled in

time to come to an end and let the people make their decision 
he told reporters he was pleased with his campaign role which he 
saw as a lightning rod for attacks by dukakis and his running 
mate lloyd bentsen 
actually thats part of our strategy quayle said we want 
them to attack the vice presidential candidate and to leave george 
bush alone we want george bush to go out and be able to speak to 
the people 
hes running for president and all the fire they want to 
direct at me were delighted quayle said 
he ducked a question whether he was concerned about polls 
suggesting that voters have lingering doubts about his fitness for 
the vice presidency 
the true test is how does george bush do in the election 
quayle replied thats the only test im interested in

the armys representative on the ruling 
fourman junta resigned monday and his replacement was named as 
part of changes wrought by president augusto pinochet in the 
military branch that is the backbone of his power 
pinochet the armys commander accepted the resignation of gen 
humberto gordon from the junta said a statement issued by army 
headquarters no reason was given for the resignation 
gordon 61 served on the junta since december 1986 
hours later another communique announced thar gen santiago 
sinclair 58 an officer noted for his fervent personal loyalty to 
pinochet had been picked by the 72yearold president to replace 
gordon 
the move apparently prompted the retirement of gen bruno 
siebert public works minister and a pinochet loyalist who had more 
seniority than sinclair although leving the army siebert woul kept 
his cabinet post the government said 
until last week sinclair had been the armys deputy 
commanderinchief the man who handles the daytoday business in 
the service as pinochet devotes most of his time to the presidency 
sinclair was replaced by gen jorge zincke 54 considered less a 
hardliner than this predecessor 
last week pinochet reshuffled the highest ranks of his army 
sending 13 generals into retirement he also promoted 10 brigadiers 
to the rank of general 
the junta also includes the commandersinchief of the navy air 
force and national police it has served as a legislature in the 
absence of a congress which was disbanded when pinochet seized 
power in a bloody 1973 military coup that ousted the elected leftist 
government of salvador allende 
pinochet last month lost a referendum in which citizens refused 
to extend his rule to 1997 and voted for a transition to democracy 
elections for a civilian congress and a successor to pinochet are 
scheduled for december 1989 
since the 1973 coup the armys representative on the junta has 
changed four times the navys representative adm jose merino has 
been a junta member since the coup

george bush sent his case to the voters monday leading in the 
polls as he pledged a steady hand to build on the 
accomplishments of the reagan years michael dukakis campaigned into 
overtime vowing a november surprise that would land him in the 
white house 
some polls suggested bushs support might be eroding as both men 
raced across america in a finalday search for votes both campaigns 
spent nearly 1 million apiece on competing halfhour appeals on 
network television and the vice president also aired a new 
fiveminute commercial that sharply attacked his democratic rival 
its in the hands of the gods and the american people the 
vice president said before heading for houston and the final rally 
of his candidacy 
im going to do my best to be a fine president and a good 
leader and somebody you can be proud of dukakis said in the 
closing commercial of his campaign 
no retreat baby no surrender said democratic running mate 
lloyd bentsen echoing rock star bruce springsteen 
dukakis was on a 48hour campaign blitz through 8500 miles that 
wouldnt end until election morning in boston he told a crowd of 
20000 in california that democrats would kick bush right out of 
our future and then flew off into the night 
democrats expressed confidence they would command majorities in 
the 101st congress that will govern alongside the new president 
they also angled for modest gains in the dozen statehouse races on 
tuesdays ballot 
both presidential campaigns relied on their 30minute network 
commercials to reach the millions of voters that the pollsters said 
hadnt yet chosen a candidate with certainty

the massachusetts governors commercial was a similar blend of 
speechmaking and images from the campaign trail and bosom of his 
family 
it showed him fielding questions on issues that have plagued him 
all campaign long including his record on crime the environment 
and his relunctance to respond to the negative attacks 
he said in reply that he had a record of achievement on crime and 
bush didnt 
he criticized bushs call for a capital gains tax cut and said it 
would benefit the wealthy at the expense of everyone else 
now who is going to pay for that tax break look beside you 
look behind you look in the mirror and ask yourself is george bush 
on your side 
the final day of americas longest costliest and some said 
nastiest presidential campaign left little room for subtlety 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen appeared on 
stage in texas with a caged quail an obvious dig at his republican 
rival dan quayle 
bush threw a stinging jab at dukakis saying we dont want to 
return to my opponents favorite song for all you do this 
recession is for you 
nor was there anything complicated about dukakis final day as a 
candidate an exercise in sleep deprivation that barbara bush

gentle fun at himself and the media traveling with him giving them 
a recorded farewell message 
in the message played aboard the media jet bush used a string 
of his wellworn campaign slogans and the stumpspeech lines 
reporters know by heart 
the tape was played as bush and the press charter flew to his 
adopted home state of texas for election day from his final campaign 
stop in st louis 
weve come a long way together he said weve solved the 
vision thing you never use the w word around me any more he 
was referring to his tendency to use thing as a catchall word and 
the wimp label that dogged him early in the campaign 
he said he he knew reporters had worked long and hard hours away 
from their homes and families to cover him 
ive seen you rushing with the cameras and the mikes when i 
unexpectedly walk one way instead of another he said and ive 
seen all this and looked at you and thought tough too bad who

twentynine homeless people protesting a lack 
of housing were arrested across from the liberty bell on monday when 
they tried to occupy a federal office building and an adjoining 
courthouse 
nearly 50 men and women a few holding children sought to enter 
the william green federal building on the edge of independence 
national historic park 
group members said they planned to sitin at the ninth floor 
offices of us sen john heinz rpa and set up a temporary 
homeless shelter but they were barred at the main entrance and a 
scuffle ensued 
two federal policemen were pushed to the ground but were not 
injured 
federal marshals and building police brought out 3foot riot 
sticks and plexiglass shields and massed in front of the inside 
lobby the equipment was never used 
protestors then circled the building to the courthouse side 
where only people with a government id card or who could show they 
had business inside were allowed in 
the protesters distributed leaflets that demanded the government 
restore 25 billion for housing programs that was cut from the 
federal budget 
peter coles director of the federal security officers said his 
plan was to keep the building open for business but to prevent any 
occupation and he ordered all but two doors left open so people 
could get in or out 
the chants outside increased what do we want houses when do 
we want them now and the demonstrators some locking hands in a 
tight chain began pushing and shoving cole ordered all the doors 
locked inside 
outside the demonstrators chained the doors shut 
hundreds of federal workers jurors and attorneys blocked from 
going to lunch crowded into the cafeteria on the second floor of the 
green building others who got out had to use the basement garage 
entrance to get back in 
thats when us attorney michael bayleson on behalf of the 
general services administration went to us district judge edward 
cahn who issued under the urgent circumstances a temporary 
restraining order directing that those blocking the doors provide a 
path for people to get in and out 
when the protestors refused to budge federal marshals and local 
police moved in and carried 29 people to vans that took them to a 
federal detention center in the courthouse basement 
all were later released on their own recognizance and ordered to 
appear for hearings 
last week seven people were arrested at a sitin at heinzs

new york city on monday began a pilot program to 
stem the spread of aids by providing drug addicts new hypodermic 
needles in exchange for their used ones 
only two men appeared at health department headquarters in lower 
manhattan to get the needles although the program which is aimed at 
reducing needle sharing among addicts is intended to serve as many 
as 200 intravenous drug abusers 
today were going to have only a handful said health 
commissioner dr stephen joseph were going to build slowly up 
over a period of weeks or months he predicted 
under the 240000 program which has drawn heated opposition 
from conservatives and some minority group organizations addicts 
also will receive counseling on aids and drugs another 200 addicts 
will receive only counseling over time their rate of infection 
will be compared with the infection rate of those receiving needles 
the program is open only to addicts over age 18 who have applied 
for drug treatment and been denied immediate admission to the citys 
overcrowded programs 
anyone wishing to apply monday had to locate a small room down a 
firstfloor corridor marked employees only no sign announced 
the location of the room and applicants had to ask for directions 
and pass several police officers to reach the programs office 
applicants would be asked to fill out a consent form learn about 
the program and take a blood test they would receive a kit 
including a condom sterile water and pamphlets about safe sex and 
needle hygiene 
an addict who tries to get a new needle without returning the old 
one will be expelled from the program joseph said 
city officials say the program is believed to be the first of its 
kind in the united states though similar programs have operated in 
europe in boston mayor raymond flynn had backed a similar 
proposal but it was rejected by the city council earlier this year 
in portland ore plans for needle distribution were delayed by 
problems obtaining liability insurance 
new yorks program is an attempt to find out whether an 
exchange can be helpful in slowing aids transmission among the 
addicts and to their sex partners and unborn children that is having 
a devastating effect on minority communities said joseph 
but two prominent black city officials police commissioner 
benjamin ward and special narcotics prosecutor sterling johnson 
criticized the program as did the city councils black and hispanic 
caucus 
when the first needle is given out by stephen joseph he ought 
to be indicted for murder its genocide pure and simple said 
councilman hilton clark of harlem 
joseph termed such criticism outrageous adding when you 
look at who this crisis is hitting hardest its the black community 
thats bearing the brunt the lives that can be saved if this 
program works is the lives of black women and babies 
originally the needles were supposed to be exchanged at other 
sites around the city but when officials at a manhattan school 
complained that the school was next door to one of those sites the 
city announced that the program would be limited to health 
department headquarters for the moment 
of the nearly 17000 aids cases reported in the city since 1981 
about 4500 are believed to have contracted the disease through 
intravenous drug abuse more than half of the citys 200000 drug 
addicts are believed to be infected with the aids virus according 
to joseph 
meanwhile in a speech to corporate executives in manhattan us 
surgeon general c everett koop endorsed the concept of a pilot 
needle exchange program although he said later he was unfamiliar 
with the details of the new york program 
of needle exchanges in general he said monday lets do it 
this aids epidemic is a catastrophe waiting to happen

democrat michael dukakis and republican george 
bush made halfhour network appeals for votes monday night the 
final chapter in a long often nasty television war that played a 
key campaign role 
dukakis the underdog hit on traditional democratic themes in a 
program featuring him on the stump dancing with his wife playing 
the trumpet and answering questions from voters at town meetings 
much of the program featured questions posed by people taped at 
locations all around the country asking questions about dukakis 
seeming coldness during the campaign his reluctance to respond to 
attacks and his positions on defense 
maybe i dont wear my heart on my sleeve but my passion is in 
my service to the public said the massachusetts governor 
appearing in a red pullover sweater in a room filled with books 
dukakis spent much of the half hour responding to issues raised 
by bush among them his crime record and his defense positions if 
elected he told one questioner you can bet your life that 
this nation will be defended and defended well 
the bush film included sizable chunks of his nomination 
acceptance speech and clips from debates as well as a number of his 
campaign commercials dropped virtually unedited into the middle of 
the program 
president reagan barbara bush the bush children and the bush 
grandchildren all appeared in the program and bushs media adviser 
roger ailes played a brief offscreen role as interviewer but vice 
presidential nominee dan quayle whom polls have shown to be a drag 
on the ticket was nowhere to be found 
bush said at one point that he respected his opponent but the 
program included reiterations of his criticism of dukakis for 
opposing the death penalty school prayer and a law requiring 
teachers to lead the pledge of allegiance and for supporting a 
liberal prisoner furlough program 
in one of the only new segments bush contended my opponent 
has no experience in national security affairs i dont believe we 
can take a risk on an issue as important as our national security 
in the final days before the election dukakis intensified his 
television drive in key mediumsized and small states while bush 
added a slashing fiveminute attack ad to his tv mix the lengthy 
bush commercial is a reprise of his attacks on dukakis record on 
crime the economy and the environment 
dukakis whose program prominently featured vice presidential 
nominee lloyd bentsen opened his network appeal with footage from 
an oct 26 town meeting in naperville ill 
in the course of the broadcast he addressed questions about 
family jobs senior citizens hunger and farmers he also attacked 
the republicans agricultural policy and charged that they would 
balance the budget by cutting social security 
dukakis touted his management of the massachusetts economy 
saying he had inherited a financial and economic basket case 
that is now an economic success story and he belittled what he 
called the only new idea george bush has had since this campaign 
began a new 40 billion fiveyear capital gains tax giveaway for 
the very rich 
now who is going to pay for that tax break dukakis demanded 
look beside you look behind you look in the mirror and ask 
yourself is george bush on your side 
it was left to bentsen to complain about bushs hardball media 
strategy the people of texas have been outraged by the 
distortions the republicans have made with their commercial tv he 
said and he contended that voters are also deeply concerned 
about the choice of quayle 
bush did not appear in his fiveminute broadside against dukakis 
instead state residents officials and others were shown charging 
that dukakis was responsible for budget deficits tax hikes job 
losses boston harbor pollution and a prison furlough program 
its a broad overview of everything that michael dukakis stands 
for according to his record bush ad director sig rogich said 
monday 
he said the ad was running in selected markets and denied it was 
introduced in response to narrowing poll margins it was planned 
long ago rogich said 
dukakis intensified his media drive over the final weekend in 
eight states where polls showed the race was tightening as a hedge 
against potential losses in one or two large industrial states the 
expanded buys were in arkansas colorado kentucky louisiana 
missouri montana new mexico and south dakota 
all told dukakis was running eight ads in spot markets in 30 
states as his campaign ended according to spokeswoman lorraine 
voles most of them stressed his on your side slogan another 
attacked bushs record as head of a drug interdiction task force and 
his choice of quayle and there was also a spot that featured 
bentsens famous youre no jack kennedy retort to quayle during 
their debate 
among the ads running for bush in spot markets across the country 
and on various networks were a musical appeal and a spot saying he 
is the only candidate experienced enough to negotiate with soviet 
leader mikhail gorbachev

a buoyant george bush ended his presidential quest 
monday night in his adopted home state of texas after declaring 
its in the hands of the gods and the american people 
addressing 6000 enthusistic supporters in a downtown shopping 
mall the vice president said most americans believe our best 
days are still ahead 
with that line borrowed from democratic rival michael dukakis 
bush ended a presidential campaign he formally begun in this city 
nearly 13 months ago 
its great to be back where it all began right here in 
texas said bush who maintains a legal voting residence here in a 
hotel suite 
bush also addressed the nation in a 30minute prime time 
commercial that combined footage from his convention acceptance 
speech of last august with parts of early commercials clips of 
members of his family and a direct electioneve appeal to voters 
that was taped last week 
in the ad bush echoed president reagan 1980 campaign line 
saying if you elect me president you will be better off four 
years from now than you are today 
in that campaign reagan had asked are you better off today 
than you were four years ago 
the film may have been as notable for what it did not include as 
what it did any mention of bushs sometimes controversial running 
mate sen dan quayle 
on the way to the gala finale in houston the republican 
presidential nominee barnstormed three battleground states in the 
middle west michigan ohio and missouri which have a combined 54 
electoral votes 
bush told rallies in rural ashland ohio and in the detroit 
suburb of southfield mich that he felt momentum building in his 
favor 
that adrenalin is flowing bush told a cheering crowd in the 
ashland college gymnasium our familys together the countrys 
coming in behind our candidacy and i want to win this election 
bush appeared with members of his family and campaign at the 
houston rally where he couldnt resist delivering several final 
vollies at dukakis 
dont play recession roulette with the liberal governor of 
massachusetts and said but the line getting the biggest cheer 
was the oftrepeated campaign refrain which bush said can be 
summed up in three short words no new taxes 
earlier in st louis at his missouri campaign headquarters he 
said i feel good but were not going to let up until we finish 
tonight its in the hands of the gods and the american people 
he told volunteers there that he hoped the harsh campaign talk of 
the past few months was over today is for looking over the 
horizon and into the future he said 
earlier standing before a huge american flag in a southfield 
shopping mall the gop nominee said he was heading for the finish 
not in a power walk but in a sprint it was a mocking reference 
to dukakis favorite form of exercise a fastpaced walk with 
weights in each hand 
bush and dukakis crossed paths during the last hours of their 
campaigns but bush spokeswoman sheila tate insisted that the vice 
president was not stalking his opponent 
is dukakis shadowing us she asked 
ms tate said the midwest was crucial to bushs election hopes 
and that he was seizing the opportunity for a final presence to 
boost his chances of carrying each state 
she said the campaigns overnight tracking polls showed bushs 
nationwide leading holding at eight to 10 percentage points and that 
no further slippage was detected 
hes in really good spirits and unconcerned by dukakis 
allnight campaign effort ms tate said 
he slept like a baby barbara bush the candidates wife 
told reporters on air force two 
she reacted philosophically to the end of the campaign what 
will be will be she said and expressed surprise at the dukakis 
nonstop final day of campaigning thats brutal she said 
bush told the michigan rally that what it all boils down to is 
that my opponent and i have a fundamentally different view of the 
future of america he said this is no time for the united 
states to turn dramatically left 
we dont want to return to my opponents favorite song for all 
you do this recession is for you bush said

the government announced monday it would introduce 
a package of legislation to create a fifth tv channel and 
deregulate the countrys entire broadcasting network 
home secretary douglas hurd the government minister responsible 
for broadcasting said the legislation to be put before parliament 
next year would lead to a huge expansion of choice for viewers and 
listeners 
britain now has two noncommercial channels run by the publicly 
funded british broadcasting corp and two independent commercial 
channels 
hurd said the plans included a fifth channel to start 
broadcasting in 1993 two new satellite stations and three 
independent national radio networks 
independent radio currently is confined to regional networks and 
plans for three satellite stations already have been approved by the 
government 
because the franchises for the new channel would go to 
competitive tender the plan has aroused concern that there would be 
less stringent quality control than now exists 
hurd said the bbc would be expected to continue high quality 
programming in both television and its network of national and 
regional radio 
although tv watching is a top leisure activity among britains 
population of 56 million change in the countrys viewing 
opportunities has come slowly 
recent government figures show that 95 percent of the population 
watches some televison and the average is 25 hours a week 
a survey by the independent broadcasting authority which is 
responsible for commercial television showed only one in three 
british adults had ever heard of the advent of direct satellite to 
home tv broadcasting and only onethird were interested in renting 
or buying the receiving equipment

an iranian father and son were sentenced monday to 
14 months and 6 months in prison respectively for trying to 
smuggle hightech missile parts from the united states to teheran 
us district judge mark l wolf said he imposed what might 
seem to some a relatively short sentence against 64yearold ahmad 
modarressi and his son majid 30 
wolf said mitigating factors included the elder modarressis age 
and poor health the younger modarressis naivete and the fathers 
belief that the us government was interested in improving 
relations with iran 
wolf characterized the younger modarressi who appeared in court 
with his american wife and 4yearold daughter as extremely 
naive perhaps more accruately described as extremely stupid 
among the sons gaffes wolf said were suggesting a 60 million 
illegal deal over the telephone to an unknown raytheon co worker 
not knowing what a tow missile was and inquiring about stinger 
missiles simply because he had heard them mentioned in a tv news 
report about afghanistan 
wolf sentenced ahmad modarressi to 14 months in prison including 
10 months he has already served as an iranian national he could be 
deported after his release 
majid modarressi was sentenced to 189 days in jail the amount of 
time he has already served he will also be required to perform 500 
hours of community service in cincinnati where he has been an 
unemployed architect 
federal prosecutors had suggested a 2year sentence for both for 
violating the us arms export control act by attempting to buy 
microwave tubes for the hawk antiaircraft missile system and sell 
them to iran 
the father pleaded guilty during their trial in us district 
court while the son was convicted oct 26 by a jury after a 19day 
trial 
the trial stemmed from a 10month investigation in which a us 
customs service agent posed as an employee of raytheon the 
lexingtonbased firm that makes the hawk system 
an undercover agent recorded conversations in which he pretended 
to agree to steal microwave amplification tubes from raytheon and 
sell them for 280000 to the modarressis 
the iranians were arrested jan 15 in a suburban boston freight 
yard where they had come to inspect the socalled twystron and 
klystron tubes 
the modarressis said they planned to disguise the tubes as 
welldrilling equipment and ship them to iran via a third country 
such as libya turkey or switzerland the tubes are a critical 
component of the radar system that allows the hawk to blast jet 
aircraft out of the sky 
the united states has prosecuted at least 46 cases of arms 
smuggling or attempted arms smuggling to iran since 1981 when the

former miss america bess myerson may have offered 
a job to a witness who was to testify against her a prosecutor said 
monday in a conference with the judge hearing the divorcefixing 
case 
walter canter a former journalist who worked as a speechwriter 
for miss myerson over a 15year period testified he heard from her 
last month for the first time since she fired him in 1983 
miss myerson the former commissioner of the department of 
cultural affairs her companion carl andy capasso 43 and 
former state supreme court justice hortense gabel 75 are on trial 
on charges stemming from capassos divorce case 
miss myerson 64 is accused of giving a 19000ayear city job 
to mrs gabels daughter sukhreet gabel to influence the judges 
decision in the divorce case 
the judges daughter was hired in august 1983 and mrs gabel 
slashed capassos temporary alimony and child support payments to 
his estranged wife less than a month later 
moments after canters testimony monday the defense objected 
and us district judge john keenan excused the jury and held a 
private conference with prosecutors and defense attorneys 
assistant us attorney stuart abrams said miss myerson told 
canter that she was thinking of starting a foundation and that she 
thought he would be a good person to head the foundation 
according to a transcript released at the end of the days hearing 
is there anything more the judge asked is it that the 
inference is to be drawn that she was trying to buy him off by 
offering him something at a foundation 
i think that is a fair inference abrams said adding that 
canter sort of made light of it he essentially sloughed it 
off 
miss myersons lawyer frederick hafetz said i think its an 
ambiguous conversation 
keenan agreed that the situation was ambiguous and that the 
testimony might be prejudicial to the other defendants he ruled it 
could not be allowed as testimony 
the lawyers and defendants are operating under a gag order and 
could not be asked for comment 
however canter in a telephone interview monday evening 
discounted what prosecutors said 
i explained it to those guys federal prosecutors there its 
a joke a longstanding joke between us canter said 
the only interpretation to it i guess was she was trying to 
have her sense of humor come out that is something when you are 
between a rock and a hard place to have your sense of humor 
canter said 
believe me its a nonstory 
canter also testified that when he went to work for miss myerson 
at cultural affairs he did not have to go through a city interview 
process his resume was not submitted for review and he did not have 
the stated qualifications for the job title he operated under 
i wasnt aware of titles canter testified 
miss myerson was familiar with my background and the work i had 
done he added i knew what i had been brought in to do and i 
did it

syria is facing new political challenges 
that are testing president hafez assads power in the region 
longtime rival iraq is challenging assad in lebanon his own 
backyard and more broadly in the arab world moderate arab leaders 
like president hosni mubarak of egypt are lining up to curb assads 
influence in lebanon 
at the same time the palestinian uprising in israeliheld 
territories has bolstered another rival yasser arafat of the 
palestine liberation organization and likely weakened syrias role 
in the middle east peace process 
assad however has proven himself a strong and agile leader 
since he came to power in a 1970 coup he has suffered setbacks 
before and managed to come out ahead 
the ideological feud between syria and iraq one of the most 
bitter interarab vendettas has been rekindled by the aug 20 
ceasefire in the iraniraq war assad had been persian irans main 
arab ally against a fellow arab 
other arabs bitterly criticized assad for siding with iran even 
though he argued that the alliance gave syria leverage that helped 
keep the conflict from spreading a claim most arabs question 
meanwhile irans military collapse which forced it to accept 
the united nationssponsored ceasefire has enhanced the military 
and political prestige of the iraqi leader president saddam 
hussein who sees himself as having saved the arab world from 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis islamic revolution 
secular syria and islamicfundamentalist iran have little in 
common except a hatred of saddam syria and iraq are ruled by rival 
wings of the baath arab socialist party 
jordan and saudi arabia got assad and saddam together last year 
but the reconciliation effort was shortlived 
iraqs statecontrolled media daily savages assad as a traitor 
to the arab nation and the slave of the imposters in tehran 
syrias equally controlled press hurls the insults right back 
in lebanon its unruly western neighbor syrias interests now 
seem to be particularly at risk 
syria which considers itself the main power broker there has 
failed to control the lebanese christians and get a prosyrian 
president elected to succeed amin gemayel whose 6year term expired 
sept 23 
gemayel a maronite catholic stepped down without a successor 
elected by parliament because of a boycott by the christians who 
opposed prosyrian candidates the only serious contenders the 
lebanese government now has split in two and iraq has been arming 
the christians main militia the lebanese forces 
the crisis has deepened the partition of lebanon split into 
christian and moslem cantons during the 13yearold civil war and 
made the prospects of a syriansponsored settlement a cornerstone 
of assads foreign policy even more distant 
it has also undercut the syrian claim to be the sole arab arbiter 
in lebanon which other countries have never really disputed until 
now 
arafat saddam hussein jordans king hussein and mubarak 
another foe of assads because of cairos 1979 peace treaty with 
israel recently formed a new alliance and called for an emergency 
arab summit on lebanon 
mubarak noting that a panarab effort was needed to save 
lebanon stressed that there is no time for indulgence in 
courtesies toward syria or other countries 
elsewhere in the region the 11monthold palestinian uprising in 
the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip has eclipsed assads 
efforts to wrench control of the palestinian cause from arafat 
the uprising has dramatically shifted the focus of the 
palestinian cause from the refugee camps in lebanon where syrias 
proxies fought for years to crush arafats forces to the occupied 
territories where assad is powerless to intervene 
arafats men were forced out of camps in beirut by syrianbacked 
palestinian dissidents heavily reinforced by syrian soldiers 
disguised as guerrillas 
but arafat still has strongholds in south lebanon and allied 
with iraq his strength has been bolstered by the uprising 
this has robbed assad of any chance of being able to deliver the 
palestinian card in a middle east peace settlement dimming the 
prospects of regaining the golan heights that israel captured from 
syria in 1967 
arafats plo is expected shortly to win approval from the 
palestine national council or parliament in exile to declare a 
palestinian state in the west bank and gaza with a provisional 
government

young portuguese farmers are 
looking for more stable incomes by switching from traditional grains 
such as wheat and corn to more exotic crops like pistachio nuts 
almonds papayas and truffles 
among the hundreds of visitors in october to the third national 
dry fruits fair in this rural town 73 miles northeast of lisbon 
those most interested in new crops seemed to be young farmers 
one such couple 38yearold former airline steward jose eduardo 
carvalho and his american wife paula 25 said they are switching 
from wheat to pistachios almonds walnuts papaya and truffles on 
the 207acre farm he inherited from his parents in the alentejo 
region north of the tagus river 
the couple said the farm lost more than 26000 last year on 
wheat 
weve both traveled widely and wherever we went pistachios were 
so expensive jose decided it was time to try grow them himself 
said paula a new jersey native 
carvalho said he hopes to tap the european economic community 
market which portugals institute for foreign trade said imported 
61480 tons of almonds and 38557 tons of pistachios last year 
the institutes data also shows that portugals exports of 
almonds to the united states have been steadily increasing reaching 
14000 tons in 1986 and 18100 tons in 1987 
but converting his fathers crops to more profitable nuts and 
fruit is not going to be cheap 
carvalho said he has already spent 35000 to import irrigation 
equipment from neighboring spain 
but the carvalhos as young farmers in western europes poorest 
nation are eligible for eec aid to help them pay for new projects 
other farmers are not so fortunate 
about twothirds of portugals estimated 970000 farmers who 
make up about onefifth of the countrys working population but 
contribute only about 9 percent to the countrys gross domestic 
product are over 55 years old and thus do not qualify for such 
assistance projects 
many of the tiny working farms in isolated rural areas also have 
the added burden of illiteracy and are less motivated to innovate 
their productivity lags way behind the west european average and 
portugal has to import more than half of what its population of 10 
million eats 
portugal has to select the most appropriate products it can 
grow for current market demands said manuel rosa a service 
director at the ministry of agriculture 
this means the production of grains wheat corn rye barley and 
oats has to be cut back and more oranges lemons and grapefruit 
planted although citrus crops compete directly with those of other 
mediterranean countries they still find a market in the colder 
northern european countries 
other new hopefuls are strawberries and melons smallscale 
production of avocados by farmers in the southern algarve region 
increased from 353 tons in 1980 to more than 870 tons in 1986 
according to the foreign trade institute 
portugals climate is such that it can grow practically 
anything exotic said carvalho whose decision to cultivate 
truffles was prompted by a look at market prices abroad 
londons famous specialist grocers fortnum amp mason sells 50 
grams 16 ounces of imported white italian truffles for the 
equivalent of 83 or about 725 a pound 
french truffles at fortnums run more than 900 a pound

while it condemns activism by 
clergymen the dutch reformed church the most influential in south 
africa works behind the scenes in trying to persuade the government 
to change its apartheid policies 
the quiet diplomacy usually is undertaken on a personal level 
president pw botha and 90 percent of his allwhite cabinet plus 
most of the whitedominated parliament are members of the dutch 
reformed church 
two years ago the church known by its afrikaans initials as the 
ngk adopted a document called church and society it declared 
apartheid a mistake termed racism a sin and said the church could 
no longer dictate specific political policies 
fifty ministers and 30000 people left the 953000member church 
to form a new rightwing church within the main church which 
represents about 38 percent of the 5 millionwhite population a 
conservative league was formed to try to repeal church and 
society 
the document said the church had been wrong to spend decades 
giving biblical justification to apartheid and advocating certain 
discriminatory laws such as a ban on mixed marriage 
its new view the church said was that the bible cannot be used 
to support any political model either apartheid or integration 
moderator johan heyns elected to head the church during the 1986 
synod that adopted church and society said that did not 
imply we have nothing to say to government the bible explicitly 
tells us there are certain major universal applicable ethical 
norms which are of paramount importance for political policy 
church and society urges the national party government to 
uphold scriptural norms calls the withholding of political rights 
an affront to human dignity and asks authorities to give ongoing 
and sympathetic attention to regulations people find offensive 
some critics argue the church still gets involved in politics but 
that its involvement is tolerated because it is regarded as the 
national party at prayer as an example critics cite the church 
leaders recent urging of congregations to sign petitions opposing 
international sanctions against south africa 
some individuals in englishspeaking churches see in the ngk a 
governmentsupporting church said heyns that worries me we do 
not support the government but we have so many members in 
government we are responsible to them spiritually 
the church is in the position of seeking to represent the 
interests of its flock mainly white afrikaners while it is 
officially open to all races it calls for speedier change of 
policies it once said were biblically justified and tries not to be 
seen as engaging in politics in a country where heyns says 
everything is seen from a political view 
in july the church magazine die kerkbode questioned the 
morality of indefinitely stationing south african troops in angola 
where cuban troops support a marxist government two months later 
the south african troops withdrew 
a few weeks after church leaders said they had spoken to law and 
order minister adriaan vlok about detentions without trial 
particularly of children vlok announced that all detainees under 16 
had been released the large majority of those detained are blacks 
the church said that since the government has made it legal for 
people of different races to marry it now is wrong not to allow 
them to live together where they choose in october parliaments 
white chamber passed a bill that would allow the countrys first 
legal multiracial residential areas 
recently heyns has spoken to president botha about nelson 
mandela the imprisoned african national congress leader and about 
the fate of the sharpeville six a group of blacks sentenced to hang 
for participation in the mob killing of a black town councillor 
heyns would not disclose details of the discussions 
we are active in these sort of deliberations but cannot 
claim credit for the governments decisions he said the church 
and state are completely independent 
he and other dutch reformed church leaders disagree strongly with 
what they call the political activism of desmond tutu the black 
anglican archbishop who won the nobel peace prize in 1984 and the 
rev allan boesak head of the mixedrace dutch reformed church in 
south africa and president of the world alliance of reformed 
churches 
the alliance disassociated itself with the ngk over apartheid 
and boesak opposes reconciliation until the white church uses its 
influence more emphatically to end apartheid and bring about a 
oneperson onevote political system 
the ngk says its members should obey the authorities and supports 
the government in maintaining law and order boesak maintains that 
the government is illegitimate on both theological and political 
grounds and favors a churchled campaign of civil disobedience 
heyns said we personally think that the moment they activist 
clergymen are going to prescribe to government what structure 
should be created they deviate from a pure church and biblical 
view they become politicians 
that is exactly what we did in the past present to the 
government a political model

an american tropical insect expert 
faces a possible prison term in brazil for backing native indians 
trying to stop the building of hydroelectric dams that could flood 
their tribal lands in the amazon 
darrell posey 41 a native of henderson ky who holds a phd 
from the university of georgia has been charged by brazils federal 
police under a law that prohibits foreigners from getting involved 
in internal brazilian affairs and denigrating the countrys 
image the maximum penalty is three years in prison followed by 
expulsion 
authorities also have forbidden the stocky bearded softspoken 
naturalist from entering certain areas inhabited by native tribes 
with which he has worked since 1977 and under the threat of 
dismissal from his brazilian government job as a professorlevel 
researcher for the national research council posey is barred from 
leaving brazil 
the amazon jungle is being destroyed at an a alarming rate 
posey recently told a group of foreign correspondents in rio de 
janeiro meanwhile native indians have lived in the amazon for 
20000 years in perfect coexistence with the environment im trying 
to call serious attention to the native philosophy for preserving 
ecology 
how can that be considered subversive 
brazil traditionally has eyed the vast hydroelectric potential of 
the amazon as a way to expand its already sophisticated industrial 
base situated mostly in the southern part of the country 
posey irked brazilian authorities when earlier this year he took 
two chiefs of the kayapo tribe to a seminar at the university of 
florida where they spoke against reported government hydroelectric 
projects in the amazon and then to washington where they repeated 
their views to the world bank which frequently helps finance such 
projects 
it was the first time outsiders got to hear the indians side 
of the amazon development story posey said chiefs kubei and 
paulinho paiakan wearing native headdresses and collars and jungle 
body paint addressed their us hosts in portuguese brazils 
official language and posey translated 
in an inexplicable move the government also indicted the 
indians who were born in brazil and never had been out of the 
country before for violating the foreigners law 
the charges against the indians have no legal basis well get 
the accusations thrown out said jose carlos castro a lawyer in 
the amazondelta city of belem where posey is based the real 
purpose is to intimidate professor posey and make him shut up 
this is purely political added castro who along with kubei 
and paiakan also met with foreign reporters 
we tried to get information about dams from our own 
government said paiakan but they wouldnt tell us anything 
they treated us like children so we went to the world bank and it 
turned out they didnt know much about these projects now they do 
federal power officials deny claims by radical environmentalists 
that they have a secret plan to build 26 hydroelectric dams 
along amazon river tributaries where indians from 11 tribes 
including the 8500member kaiapos live fish and hunt in 
relatively untouched primitive conditions 
of the estimated 5 million indians here when portuguese explorers 
discovered brazil in 1500 only around 250000 remain in an 
overall population of 144 million anthropologists have expressed 
fears about the indians continued survival as hundreds of 
thousands of nonindian homesteaders ranchers and prospectors 
stream into the amazon annually chopping and burning away the 
rainforest and ignoring demarcations of native tribal areas 
there have been a lot of gossip and rumors about hydroelectric 
plans in the amazon diomedes ferreira jr the spokesman for a 
government amazonian power company called eletronorte cq 
eletronorte said in brasilia the capital we have looked into 
only six potential dam sites and were talking about projects that 
wouldnt be carried out until well into the 21st century 
the government will do everything possible to protect the 
environment and the indians ferreira said 
meanwhile and without saying whether the indians sudden high 
profile had anything to do with it the government says it has 
shelved plans for a proposed dam known as babaquara on the xingu 
river a major amazon tributary that passes through the kayapo 
lands its reservoir would have covered 2300 square miles twice 
the size of rhode island brazil had intended to ask the world bank 
to finance it 
now says ferreira the only xingu dam under possible 
consideration is one called kararao with a reservoir onefifth the 
size of that of babaquara 
the world bank in washington said construction of the 11 
millionkilowatt kararao installation nearly twice as large as 
washingtons grand coulee dam the united states biggest could 
not begin until 1991 or 1992 
ferreira said so far were talking only about hydroelectric 
potential feasibility studies were not saying kararao will be 
built but even if it is there wouldnt be another dam in that 
region before 2010 
nonetheless a kayapo legal fund partially coordinated by posey 
has been set up at the university of california at berkeley to keep 
an eye on the amazon dam situation 
the kayapos plan to call a multitribal meeting of up to 5000 
indians in late january to discuss the overall problem of amazon 
development projects 
the indians are serious said posey the problem is that 
hardly anyone takes them seriously and they have so much to teach 
us

sometimes network news simply informs 
sometimes it actually enlightens sometimes as in the case of the 
1988 presidential election it does neither 
when whales bobbing amid alaska ice floes become as big a 
television story as the contest for the next leader of the united 
states something is wrong 
from the iowa caucus media spree to the manufactured what does 
jesse want stories of the democratic convention to novembers 
addiction to opinion polls televisions flashy political coverage 
has had the weight of melba toast 
the collapse of thoughtful reporting comes at a crucial time 
more than half of all americans now say they depend on television 
news as their single source of information its no shock then 
that this years presidential turnout may be the lowest since calvin 
coolidges election in the 1920s does anyone want to elect a 
soundbite 
the candidates have been reduced on television to mumblers of 
mostly meaningless charges and countercharges we may want policy 
statements but we get photo opportunities where do the nominees 
really stand on middle east policy the deficit welfare reform 
with occasional exceptions the networks dont seem to know or care 
television of course has no legal obligation to present 
thorough work dan rather if he wanted could read aloud from the 
national enquirer for 22 minutes every weeknight its understood 
though that in exchange for free broadcast licenses television 
will aim every so often for public service 
not this time around 
television tends to do best when it watches and doesnt create 
thats why a space shuttle launch is usually more riveting than the 
latest alf episode at its most useful television takes our 
eyes and ears where they otherwise could not go 
but in looking at this years campaign televisions cameras have 
blinked rather than stared thereby helping define the simplistic 
terms under which the campaign was to be conducted 
the resulting flood of video mishmash long on symbols and 
personalities and short on substance has to a degree even 
influenced coverage by print journalists perhaps because there 
was not much else to talk about analysis of this campaign is 
already beginning to hone in on televisions role michael oreskes 
of the new york times wrote recently 
not much else to talk about george bush and michael dukakis sit 
at opposite ends of the political spectrum surely theres more 
than one story in that television though doesnt seem to notice 
its horserace fascination to be sure is nothing new but in 1988 
it has taken on new dimensions 
a week and a half before the election nbcs tom brokaw was still 
asking dukakis why he didnt perform better in the second 
presidential debate 
abcs sunday newscast two days before the election led with 
an assessment that 439 electoral votes are firmly in or leaning 
toward bushs column while dukakis can count 30 is this a public 
service 
abc news president roone arledge blames the political parties for 
fixing the process to such an extent that its become a bore to the 
public and therefore to the news media 
its very hard to to cover substance when theres no substance 
there he told reporters recently and i think more and more 
things are packaged for television and it is not us who are doing 
the packaging and its not us who wanted to be packaged that way 
but why are the campaigns packaging their message because 
they know its the packaged soundbite that will get on the air 
its much easier and probably more fun to produce an 
elaborate graphic on the latest poll than analyze arcane issues 
that decision however has an impact beyond the basic information 
presented not only does it discourage intellectual engagement in 
the political process but it also appears to have favored bush over 
dukakis since dukakis message is arguably more difficult to grasp 
according to the nonpartisan center for media and public 
affairs televisions campaign coverage down the homestretch was 
more partial to the republican ticket the centers study of 474 
abc nbc and cbs election stories found that bush surpassed dukakis 
in good press by a 56 percent to 22 percent margin furthermore 
nearly one story in four featured poll results usually favorable 
toward bush the organization reported 
despite all the attention to his negative ads bushs 
domination of the network newscasts was the real catalyst to his 
comeback said the organizations robert lichter 
david burke president of cbs news said not long ago that the 
unwantingtoknow public is responsible for reducing the state 
of political art in the country thats an easy out chances are 
if television had really delved into the issues viewers would stay 
tuned the gameshow fans already have wheel of fortune

continued growth in production and orders helped 
the economy accelerate in october after slowing the previous month 
according to the nations purchasing managers 
the purchasing managers index rose to 568 in october from 548 
in september remaining below the years peak of 593 in june the 
national association of purchasing management said in a report 
released monday 
an index above 50 percent generally indicates the economy is 
expanding 
in addition to the growth in production new orders grew at a 
slightly faster pace than in september while new export orders rose 
again and employment rose sharply the group reported 
despite the apparent slowing in the growth rate of new export 
orders the continued high level of new orders coupled with a 
reduced inflation rate suggests the fourth quarter economy will be 
as good as the previous three stated robert j bretz chairman of 
the organizations business survey committee 
a number of economists closely watch the purchasing managers 
report because it gives solid clues to the direction of the economy 
production rose in october for the 27th consecutive month the 
index for production rose to 603 up sharply from septembers 560 
which marked a slowdown from the 582 reading in august 
the index for new orders rose to 589 from septembers 584 
narrowly reversing a threemonth string of declining growth rates 
but trailing the 621 level of july 
new export orders a major element of recent economic growth 
grew in october but the pace slowed for the third straight month 
among respondents who export 26 percent reported higher export 
orders down slightly from 27 percent in september and sharply lower 
than the 378 percent average for the first seven months of 1988 
the proportion reporting lower export orders rose to 8 percent the 
highest percentage this year and up from 6 percent in september 
employment rose sharply during the month considering normal 
seasonal variations with the index jumping to a new 1988 high of 
537 from septembers 502 and reversing two consecutive months of 
slowing growth 
the employment index echoes the labor departments report on 
friday that us unemployment fell to 53 percent in october 
matching a 14year low as employers added 325000 new jobs 
deliveries from vendors slowed for the 25th straight month an 
indication that suppliers cant keep up with strong demand 
although a rise in the index to 556 from 550 in september 
continues signaling that the rate of slowing is declining 
inventories declined slightly during october after accounting 
for normal seasonal variations with the index dropping to 494 from 
496 
prices rose during october with more purchasers reporting price 
increases than decreases for the 27th straight month the index 
dipped to 707 from 722 in september however indicating that the 
rate of price increase slowed for the fourth straight month 
the report is based on surveys of purchasing executives in more 
than 250 industrial companies in 21 industries in all 50 states the

mcorp and federal regulators have reached a 
compromise over a planned government bailout that may keep the 
financially troubled company out of bankruptcy court 
under the accord announced on sunday the federal deposit 
insurance corp said it wouldnt force mcorp to inject 400 million 
into several of its subsidiary banks in return mcorp agreed to 
open its books to potential buyers 
the company indicated last week that it might have to file for 
protection from its creditors under chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
laws to avoid complying with the federal order 
mcorp spokesman george mccane said the compromise reduces the 
pressure of regulators that might force mcorp to reorganize 
the understanding weve achieved is a step forward to resolving 
mcorps capital needs he said it reflects a healthy level of 
cooperation between the company the comptroller of the currency and 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
fdic chairman l william seidman said the agreement will enable 
the fdic to work toward the most effective and least costly 
resolution to mcorps problems in a way that is consistent with the 
legitimate interests of all parties concerned 
mcorp the secondlargest bank holding company in texas asked 
the fdic for assistance on oct 7 after reporting a thirdquarter 
loss of more than 500 million 
at the time the company proposed to inject into its troubled 
bank subsidiaries 800 million half of which would come from 
private investors if the fdic provided financial assistance 
analysts predicted mcorp would need about 1 billion from the 
federal bank insurer

allen rosenshine who was selected to head 
omnicom group inc at its formation two years ago with the merger of 
three advertising agencies announced monday that he is stepping 
down to head one of its subsidiaries 
the 49yearold former ad copywriter said that at his own 
suggestion he would become chief executive of bbdo worldwide an 
omnicom agency whose clients include pepsicola soft drinks apple 
computers and general electric lighting 
rosenshine will replace norman w campbell 54 who is retiring 
as bbdos chief executive rosenshine headed bbdo before the omnicom 
merger 
rosenshine said in a statement that the omnicom board had 
accepted his recommendation to name bruce crawford 59 to succeed 
rosenshine as chief executive of omnicom 
crawford had once headed bbdo but left at the end of 1985 to 
become general manager of the metropolitan opera in new york 
the changes will take effect as soon after jan 1 as possible 
depending on time required for orderly transitions within omnicom 
bbdo and the metropolitan opera the statement said 
rosenshine said campbell had expressed a desire to retire as soon 
as the postmerger transition could be completed 
he told the board that since crawford had indicated a desire to 
return to the ad business he felt it would be a good time to make 
the changes 
omnicom was created in august 1986 with the merger of bbdo doyle

the number of working oil and gas rigs rose by 19 
this week to total 942 industry watcher baker hughes inc reported 
monday 
the increase continues a seesaw trend following a previous week 
decline of 10 working rigs and an increase of eight two weeks ago a 
year ago the count was 1141 baker hughes said 
the count is a widely watched industry index of drilling activity 
and it reflects the number of rigs actively exploring for oil as of 
last friday not the number of rigs actively producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states oklahoma saw the largest 
increase with nine followed by north dakota four louisiana three 
kansas ohio and pennsylvania two each and michigan one

japan retained its lead as the worlds leader in 
per capita savings last year beating out the thrifty swiss for a 
second straight year an international survey published monday found 
the study by the international savings banks institute said each 
japanese citizen on average saved 38439 by the end of 1987 an 
increase of 11136 over the previous year 
switzerland formerly the longtime leader recorded per capita 
savings of 34763 an increase of about 9500 
the us savings rate is 9888 up from 9529 in 1986 
the report cited the strong value of the yen and swiss franc 
against the dollar as the main factors contributing to the high 
figures 
the 35nation survey counted only bank savings 
switzerland was followed by belgium with 17987 west germany 
with 16102 and austria with 13269 
the report said that savings remained at a good level due to a 
generally good control of inflation in several countries the good 
economic performance average and a small decrease in 
unemployment 
it also said volumes of savings in many countries surveyed showed 
substantial growth especially after the fluctuations on the stock 
exchange markets last year which led savers to come back to more 
traditional ways of investing 
the countries with the lowest per capita savings according to the 
study were niger with 7 ethiopia with 18 and senegal with 69

stock prices declined sharply in light to 
moderate trading today as concern about tuesdays presidential 
election and what could come afterward dominated the market 
the market opened lower and continued to decline as skittish 
investors withdrew from buying and selling in anticipation of 
tuesdays outcome 
were not seeing a lot of selling but just a lot of people not 
buying said philip puccio senior vice president at dillon read 
amp co 
early in the day analysts said some investors had decided to 
reduce their stock portfolios before tuesdays vote 
people came in in a selling mood today said charles jensen 
an analyst with mki securities corp 
but while the presidential election appeared to be the dominating 
force in todays market some observers said the markets weakness 
suggested that many investors were already looking beyond the 
election and to wat could come afterward 
late last week the stock market lost ground as new economic data 
indicating the economy might be growing faster than expected revived 
fears of higher inflation and interest rates 
some analysts had predicted that the federal reserve would wait 
until after the election to put the skids on inflation by raising 
interest rates 
what is happening today is an extension of the anxieties that 
hit the market last week said michael metz an analyst with 
oppenheimer amp co 
weaker bond prices and lower transport stock prices also weighed 
heavily on todays stock market analysts said 
the bond market is leading our market puccio said i 
would be worried if i saw a bigger trading volume but its very 
slow 
the stronger october unemployment data renewed concern that the 
economy may be heating up signaling higher inflation and interest 
rates if the federal reserve moves to tighten credit

a landslide victory for george bush is already in the bank so to 
speak 
in a gimmick to attract deposit dollars a handful of banks and 
thrifts nationwide have offered investors bonus interest rates on 
certificates of deposits based on the outcome of tuesdays 
presidential election 
and if that money talks bush wins 
at the regency savings bank in naperville ill customers with a 
minimum of 2000 to invest had three months to put their money in 
either a oneyear cd for bush or his democratic challenger 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
holders of the winning presidential election cd would receive 
an extra 05 percent interest which would mean a jump to 775 
percent from 725 percent when the cd was first offered 
marketing assistant carol johnson said that as of saturday the 
purchasing cutoff date a whopping 9375 percent of all 3 million 
in sales were for bush cds with dukakis getting the rest 
bush has always been ahead but it seems to me its gone up 
quite a bit over the last couple of weeks ms johnson said 
not too surprisng for naperville an affluent chicago suburb that 
is heavily republican 
in the washington dc area perpetual savings bank had similar 
results for its presidential certificate of deposits 
robert barton senior vice president of investor relations said 
that as of the saturday cutoff 63 percent of the thrifts 
approximately 3 million in sales of two and fouryear cds were 
republican 
barton said the margin was a lot narrower when the cds were first 
offered in september and widened in recent weeks 
at perpetual depositors of both persuasions are eligible for a 
bonus regardless of who wins the election the thrift will award 
bonus interest to all depositors up to a maximum of 05 percent 
based on the winners margin of victory in the popular vote 
robert k heady publisher of the north palm beach fla 
newsletter bank rate monitor said these special cd sales have 
broken some new ground 
politics has replaced the toaster as the hottest bank premium 
of the fall of 1988 he said

last weeks computer virus attack the biggest 
ever has caught the attention of leaders in business and government 
and should lead to improvements in computer security several 
consultants said monday 
but the top officials who ordinarily relegate security matters 
to lowerlevel employees may be disturbed to find how expensive and 
inconvenient it can be to make their computers less vulnerable to a 
virus attack 
im not sure theres a willingness to pay the check to do all 
the things that would have to be done to really close down all the 
loopholes said steven ross senior manager for information 
protection services at the accounting and consulting firm of 
deloitte haskins amp sells 
security consultants said they had received far more inquiries 
than usual since the end of last week but they said computer 
security is a wideranging matter that cannot be solved simply by 
assigning passwords and installing some antiviral software 
the attachment of computers into farflung networks a pervasive 
trend of the 1980s has made each individual computer far more 
vulnerable to penetration from an outsider 
jon david a computer security consultant in tappan ny said 
businesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimate 
the challenge 
the amazing thing is the attitude im getting is why dont 
you stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselves 
from viruses he said 
several consultants said last weeks virus attack which infected 
6000 computers in the arpanet research network heightened the 
consciousness of senior managers in a way that smaller previous 
attacks had not 
the virus clogged computers at universities and research 
institutes by spreading from one computer to another by electronic 
mail and making repeated copies of itself it did not damage any 
data and was eventually erased 
the real culprit in lax security is management management 
has finally become aware of what can happen to them said thomas 
prugh executive vice president for science and technology at 
information security international inc in silver spring md 
prugh said computer security had probably been on a steady 
downtrend since the 1950s when each computer was isolated in a 
locked room and only a handful of people were able or permitted to 
use it 
prugh said the downward trend in security probably reversed 
earlier this year when awareness of the vulnerability of networked 
computers began to grow 
but prugh and others said there is a long way to go 
this was all very predictable well in advance the problem 
stems not from fantastic genius but from fantastic stupidity said 
ross of deloitte haskins amp sells 
ross said he expected boards of directors to take note of the 
security threats but he said there were also signs of emerging 
complacency in some quarters 
the reaction already is that this is an isolated instance this 
is a boy genius you cant prevent this and besides no harm was 
done ross said 
the only reason all the worlds computers havent crashed at 
the same time is because they arent yet networked together 
lincoln d faurer president of the corporation for open systems 
international said in a recent speech he said he intended the 
remark as a joke with a message 
weve got some pretty powerful tools but were not using 
those tools said george hertzberg a specialist in computer 
security at fairleigh dickinson university in rutherford nj 
the problem is that most kinds of security make things more 
timeconsuming and inconvenient for computer users and the users 
job evaluations are based on how productive they are hertzberg said 
when you try to implement any kind of control procedure you 
are immediately confronted by those people who say hey ive got a 
job to get done youre slowing the system down youre getting in 
the way 
even kinds of security that would not slow down the users have 
not been adequately pursued according to a study last year based on 
a survey by ernst amp whinney of 400 dataprocessing professionals out 
of 1200 at a computer security conference 
nine percent of the respondents said they had lost 50000 to 1 
million because of systems failures or downtime in the previous 
year while another 2 percent said their losses exceeded 1 million 
those losses were unrelated to security breaches 
but when asked about their contingency planning for failures or 
downtime 40 percent said it was irregular or nonexistent said 
david r wilson ernst amp whinneys national director of information 
systems consulting 
every major corporation in the country especially those that 
tie into open networks are taking looks at their systems to see if 
theyre vulnerable and of course what theyll discover is that they 
are vulnerable wilson said

trans world airlines inc announced monday that 
its president has resigned and the company is restructuring its top 
management 
twa which was privatized on oct 24 said president d joseph 
corr is resigning effective nov 30 
corr wont be directly replaced as president the airline said a 
new threeman office of the chairman will be created to combine 
both executive and operational functions 
the new office will consist of twas current chairman and owner 
financier carl icahn alfred kingsley a member of the board of 
directors and jerry nichols senior vice president for ground 
operations at twa 
under the new setup icahn will continue as chairman and chief 
executive officer kingsley will still be called a director and 
nichols will become executive vice president 
about 15 vice presidents will report directly to the threeman 
team 
this structure will do away with unnecessary layers of 
management and will give much more autonomy and responsibility to 
the vice presidents in the field icahn said in a statement 
corr will remain on the boards of both twa and acf industries 
inc a railcar leasing company owned by icahn his future plans 
include the purchase of a company as yet unnamed in which icahn 
expects to invest twa said 
corr was recently mentioned in published reports as one of the 
parties interested in buying troubled eastern airlines from parent 
texas air corp which recently sold easterns shuttle service to 
developer donald trump for 365 million in cash 
last month icahn broke off efforts to acquire the rest of 
eastern after failing to structure a deal that would satisfy the 
airlines militant unions 
icahn said monday that while he is happy with twas financial 
turnaround since he took over the company it still faces many 
challenges in the future 
there was no question twa must grow to thrive and by far 
the most preferable way for the airline to grow is through 
acquisitions he said 
icahn also said that unless twa makes an acquisition of major 
importance and possibly even if it does the airline will order 
30 to 60 new narrowbody planes in the next three to six months 
mark buckstein the airlines general counsel said recently that 
twa plans to lease or buy about 60 new aircraft to upgrade its aging 
fleet at a cost of up to 15 billion

copper futures prices fell sharply monday on new yorks commodity 
exchange after the london metal exchange reported an increase in its 
warehouse stocks of copper for the first time in two months 
it was the third price decline in as many sessions but analysts 
were divided on the significance of the buildup in copper stocks in 
london 
on other markets precious metals gained grains were mostly 
higher while soybeans finished lower livestock and meat were mixed 
energy futures rose and stockindex futures retreated 
us copper futures traders had been expecting the london metal 
exchange to report a decline of 5000 to 10000 metric tons last 
week in the amount of copper stored in exchangesanctioned 
warehouses 
instead the exchange said stocks rose 125 metric tons to 70925 
metric tons it was the first increase since sept 5 when the 
exchange reported inventories totaling 122125 metric tons 
the report startled copper traders on new yorks comex who had 
grown jittery after bidding the metals spot price to an alltime 
high of 1538 a pound last week 
copper for spot delivery settled 335 cents lower at 14565 a 
pound monday on the comex while the most active futures contract 
for december delivery was 31 cents lower at 1389 a pound 
the report of a 125ton rise in copper stocks really caused the 
market to move lower said bette raptopoulos metals analyst in 
new york with prudentialbache securities inc 
but ms raptopoulos said the bull markets fundamental 
underpinnings tight supplies strong demand and a 3weekold 
copper miners strike in peru remained in place suggesting prices 
could recover and advance to new highs 
craig sloane an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
said the unexpected rise in copper inventories should be viewed as a 
caution light 
it is significant in that it breaks the trend of sizeable 
declines thats been going on for two months sloane said 
the slight increase should not be thrown out as something 
meaningless he said it could very well be the start of 
something new but i wouldnt bet the whole farm on it 
preciousmetals prices advanced on the comex amid strong overseas 
buying spurred by the dollars decline against other currencies 
analysts said 
gold settled 120 to 160 higher with december at 42470 a 
troy ounce silver was 65 cents to 76 cents higher with december 
at 653 a troy ounce 
grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the chicago board of 
trade with grains mostly higher and soybeans mostly lower 
the soybean market settled near the days highs though on 
speculation that the soviet union was planning large purchases of 
us soybeans and soybean meal experts said 
after the close the agriculture department confirmed that the 
soviet union had purchased 300000 metric tons of us soybean meal 
the grain markets had opened lower on disappointment about the 
lack of new export business but most prices rebounded late in the 
session on a news report that the no 2 official in the soviet 
grainbuying agency had said the soviet union would need to buy 1 
million metric tons of us soybeans or soymeal for both february 
and march delivery said victor lespinasse a trader with dean 
witter reynolds inc in chicago 
there was just an explosion in the meal market in the last 
minute or so he said 
wheat settled 1 cents lower to 3 cents higher with december at 
419 a bushel corn was unchanged to 2 cents higher with december 
at 278 a bushel oats were 6 cents to 8 cents higher with 
december at 225 a bushel soybeans were 3 cents lower to 2 cents 
higher with november at 788 a bushel 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live cattle settled 15 cent 
lower to 28 cent higher with december at 7360 cents a pound 
feeder cattle were 05 cent lower to 35 cent higher with november 
at 8145 cents a pound hogs were 30 cent lower to 37 cent higher 
with december at 4212 cents a pound frozen pork bellies were 22 
cent lower to 13 cent higher with february at 4612 cents a pound 
energy futures posted moderate gains on the new york mercantile 
exchange 
west texas intermediate crude oil was 2 cents to 15 cents higher 
at 1406 barrel heating oil was 05 cent to 37 cent higher with 
december at 4413 cents a gallon unleaded gasoline was 17 cent to 
91 cent higher with december at 4725 cents a gallon

the worlds largest newsprint maker pressured by 
weak demand and resistance from american newspapers said monday it 
would drastically reduce and delay its latest announced price hike 
abitibiprice inc of toronto has told its customers it decided 
to increase prices for newspaper customers by 30 to 680 a metric 
ton effective feb 1 instead of the previously announced 695 a 
metric ton 
but analysts said that unless two smaller usbased newsprint 
makers announce price increases by next month this latest rise 
might not occur 
last september abitibi announced it was raising its newsprint 
prices to 695 a metric ton a 69 percent increase effective jan 
1 several other manufacturers including bowater inc the largest 
us producer followed suit 
but newspaper officials balked arguing that the price hikes were 
unjustified because of weak demand for newsprint they said a fall 
in advertising meant they did not need as much paper to print their 
newspapers 
they also said a buildup of inventories and increased capacity of 
paper mills starting next year meant a larger supply of newsprint 
would be available we are obviously disappointed that our price 
announcement for both the us and canada have had to be modified 
or i should say has been modified said robert johnson senior 
vice president of marketing for abitibis sales and marketing unit 
in new york but we are obviously aware of the realities of the 
marketplace 
canadian pacific forest products ltd of toronto was the first to 
announce last week that it was cutting its previously announced 
price increase 
but analysts said champion international corp of stamford 
conn and kimberlyclark corp of dallas started the ball rolling 
on nov 1 when they did not notify their customers that they would 
follow the lead of abitibi and other bigger newsprint companies that 
announced their price increases in september 
under terms of their customer contracts both companies were 
required to give two months notice of price hikes most other 
newsprint makers operate under contracts that require three months 
notice to customers 
the only way these companies can compete is in price said 
one wall street analyst who did not want to be named if one 
company increases its price and the next does not then the company 
with the higher price will lose market share 
the analyst said the big newsprint makers boosted prices on the 
assumption that fourthquarter demand would increase however that 
has not happened and thats why champion decided not to increase 
prices he said 
analysts said that the two companies have until dec 1 to meet 
the latest price hike for their customers if they do not that 
could mean even the lower prices might not take effect they said 
the handwriting is on the wall said eric philo an analyst 
with the investment firm goldman sachs amp co it looks like there 
will be excess capacity in the next few years

otasco inc a 70yearold tulsabased retail 
chain filed for bankruptcy reorganization and has closed 170 stores 
in 11 states company officials announced monday 
jerry goodman chairman and chief executive officer of the 
company said the chapter 11 bankruptcy petition was filed sunday 
night in federal court in tulsa 
company stores did not open monday and 1600 employees were 
advised they were being terminated he said 
goodman said otasco purchased by its employees four years ago 
had 187 million in assets and 163 million in liabilities with 
secured debt of 94 million and 50 million in unsecured debt 
he said company officials had been unable to negotiate a 
settlement with otascos bankers 
among otascos largest creditors are ameritrust co of cleveland 
226 million general electric co 105 million mtd products 
64 million and uniroyal inc 58 million 
ameritrust issued a statement monday saying it was the lead 
lender in an 86 million secured loan agreement with otasco but 
that six participating lenders have assumed all but 226 million of 
that liability 
goodman said the decision to file for chapter 11 was made because 
the company did not have funds to purchase christmas inventory 
otasco which specializes in automotive products and appliances 
has been struggling in recent years in part because of the 
depressed oil and agriculture industries in its markets goodman 
said 
otasco was started in 1918 and grew to a chain of more than 600 
companyowned and associate stores in a 14state area in the 
southeastern and south central united states 
it was purchased by mccrory corp in 1961 and four years ago was 
bought back by employees to become the fourthlargest employee owned 
company in the country 
the name of the company is an abbreviation for oklahoma tire and 
supply co 
two years ago the company undertook a restructuring plan in which 
it reduced debt closed 94 unprofitable stores liquidated a 
discount outlet store and consolidated warehouse and distribution 
facilities 
goodman who became president and chief executive officer in 
1983 said he hoped the company will be reorganized into a smaller 
company but probably a more viable company than we have been in the 
past 
about 250 employees including managers of otasco stores 
remained on the payroll to service customer accounts during the 
reorganization transition goodman said he said customer services 
would be maintained 
goodman said he believed the company could be reorganized to 
pursue a new strategy that will allow it to compete with large 
discount store chains 
in addition to oklahoma otasco has stores in alabama arkansas 
georgia kansas louisiana missouri mississippi south carolina 
tennessee and texas

churchs fried chicken incs board of 
directors on monday rejected as inadequate a 290 million takeover 
offer by rival popeyes famous fried chicken and biscuits and said it 
would file a federal court suit to block the bid 
the board of san antoniobased churchs the nations 
secondlargest fried chicken chain behind kentucky fried chicken 
also indicated it had instructed management to explore alternatives 
to the 8 a share popeyes offer including a possible leveraged 
buyout merger with another suitor or major acquisition by churchs 
churchs had been studying the offer popeyes parent company a 
copeland enterprises inc of new orleans for about two weeks 
churchs shares dipped 25 cents to 775 a share monday on the 
new york stock exchange 
churchs also announced a shareholder protection plan aimed at 
making a hostile takeover more difficult and said it would file a 
counterclaim in louisiana federal court to stop popeyes from 
pursuing the takeover offer 
popeyes spokesman mark mckinnon said the company would stand by 
its offer 
we are disappointed we still want a friendly deal and would 
sign a confidentiality agreement to get more information about the 
company mckinnon said the bottom line is we are not going 
away 
mckinnon said the company believed churchs legal motions were 
unfounded and company officials believed they could lead churchs to 
greater profitability 
churchs officials also have filed motions in federal court in 
san antonio seeking a declaratory judgment upholding the shareholder 
rights plan 
the shareholder rights plan commonly known as a poison pill 
enables churchs shareholders to sharply increase their holdings in 
the company in the event a hostile bidder acquires a stake of 20 
percent or more and to buy at a discount stock in the hostile 
bidder if it wins control of churchs such plans are aimed at 
making a hostile buyout prohibitively expensive 
this is a program thats designed not to prevent a takeover 
but to encourage a potential buyer to negotiate properly for the 
benefit of the shareholder said ernest renaud churchs president 
and chief executive officer 
it makes the potential buyer go back and do his homework on the 
offer and allows the board time to look at the takeover offer and 
not to stampede into it renaud said 
churchs also said it would be filing an answer and counterclaims 
in louisiana federal court against copeland and other individuals 
the counterclaims hope to keep copeland from continuing its offer 
on charges that it would violate securities and antitrust laws and 
also alleges former churchs employees used confidential information 
regarding churchs 
churchs which has gone through management changes the last 
several years expects sales of around 520 million this year from 
its more than 1500 restaurants down from about 570 million in 
1986 and 633 million in 1984 
popeyes the no 3 chicken restaurant expects sales of 485 
million this year there are 725 popeyes restaurants nationwide 100 
of them companyowned

sears roebuck and co may be adopting a 
lowcost mentality under its recentlyannounced restructuring 
but that doesnt mean it will be running a chain of discount stores 
sears chairman said monday 
a new policy of every day low pricing plus other changes 
will instead mean far fewer promotional sales and in some cases 
fewer choices of products in sears stores said company chairman 
edward brennan 
we intend to take our current mix of merchandise and go to a 
low everyday price strategy with that mix brennan told a group 
of securities analysts and reporters at sears tower in chicago 
dont feel like we are going to be something that looks like a 
discounter with shopping carts and checkout counters at the 
doors he said 
a significant increase in the number of sears retail stores 
now about 825 also could occur in coming years he said 
sears officials announced last week they would revamp 
merchandising and sell the 110story sears tower the worlds 
tallest building in a bid to improve the companys earnings no 
buyers for the building have been announced 
company officials also revealed plans to move the companys 
merchandise group out of sears tower meaning 8000 jobs could be 
relocated 
we would like to keep the organization here in chicago and we 
will do everything possible to make that happen brennan said 
monday but he added we think its our responsibility to the 
shareholders to explore all options 
the restructuring is intended to have sears employees adopt a 
lowcost mentality and the signal of moving our headquarters 
is a huge huge step in that direction brennan said 
michael bozic chairman of the merchandise group said at the 
meeting that lessening the number of promotional sales on individual 
items could save the company up to 200 million a year through 
reduced paperwork inventory handling and related costs 
brennan said the marketing strategy also should mean better 
return for advertising dollars 
sears has said that under the restructuring it also would buy 
back up to 10 percent of its stock divest its coldwell banker 
commercial real estate subsidiary and take 425 million in aftertax 
fourthquarter charges 
brennan said last week that the restructuring is designed to 
enhance sears value to shareholders immediately and to concentrate 
its resources over the longer term on consumeroriented businesses 
retailing insurance real estate and financial services 
sears also plans to continue trying out other new marketing 
techniques including offering more national brands of some types of 
products and opening specialty stores 
sears net income in the third quarter was 3442 million or 90 
cents per share that compared with 409 million or 108 a share 
for thirdquarter 1987

kroger co said monday it had reached an 
outofcourt settlement with 11 of 14 shareholders who sued to block 
the companys 46 billion restructuring program although three 
shareholders will fight the deal 
the shareholders filed six classaction lawsuits after kroger on 
sept 15 announced plans to restructure to discourage two 
unsolicited takeover proposals 
the suits consolidated into one accuse kroger executives of 
trying to protect their jobs by the restructuring 
under the plan shareholders will get a special 40 cash dividend 
and a bond with a trading value of about 8 for each share they own 
kroger officials said they decided to settle to avoid further 
expense inconvenience and distraction 
the settlement if approved by the hamilton county common pleas 
court would accelerate the maturity of the bonds by two years to 
oct 15 2006 and make other changes in how quickly kroger must 
redeem the bonds 
it also would prohibit the company from redeeming bonds before 
oct 15 1993 
kroger will pay a premium in the form of a percentage of 
between 1 and 3 points more than face value on bonds it redeems 
between 1993 and 1996 the premium would be paid in addition to any 
accrued interest 
kroger spokesman paul bernish said a court hearing on the 
settlement should be set for mid to latedecember 
attorney gene mesh representing three shareholders said he 
would file formal objections to the settlement because it does not 
give shareholders any additional benefits 
he said he wants further restrictions on when kroger may redeem 
the bonds and wants the company to pay a higher premium for 
redeeming them early 
mesh contended that the settlement in which kroger has agreed to 
pay 127 million to the plaintiffs lawyers was carved out only 
to satisfy the attorney fees

a graduate student believed responsible for a computer virus 
that jammed an estimated 6000 systems nationwide last week has 
obtained a lawyer and sources said monday that the fbi upgraded its 
inquiry to a full criminal investigation 
cornell university computer experts said a weekend of 
troubleshooting left them with little evidence to conclude that 
robert t morris jr was the source of the rogue program despite 
one officials comment that an early version of the program was 
found in morris files 
morris 23 isnt saying anything publicly other than a fleeting 
remark to a television station that all the attention has become a 
bit terrifying 
the virus so named because it multiplies after invading a 
computer jammed computers across the country linked to the 
pentagonsupported arpanet network slowing computers by reproducing 
itself over and over 
those computer centers affected by the virus say it only took up 
memory space and did not destroy any files 
a federal government source familiar with the case who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said justice department officials had 
decided to step up the fbis involvement in the case from a 
preliminary inquiry to a fullscale criminal investigation of morris 
and the events surrounding the virus 
the washington post in its tuesday editions quoted law 
enforcement sources as saying that the inquiry had been expanded to 
a full field investigation by the fbis washington field office 
the paper said that meant fbi officials had consulted with 
federal prosecutors and agreed that the fbi had jurisdiction and 
that there was reason to believe there may have been a violation of 
federal criminal law 
fbi spokesman charles steinmetz declined to give details on the 
cases progress but said fbi officials probably had talked with the 
us attorneys office over the weekend 
in a fullscale investigation the government has the power to 
subpoena records and documents and compel testimony through the 
authorization of immunity two techniques which are not permitted 
through preliminary inquiries the move indicated the fbi was moving 
very quickly in the case because in many instances preliminary 
inquiries take a month or more 
justice sources said the fbi was trying on monday to get an 
interview with morris and apparently had not done so by the end of 
the day 
another government source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said investigators were not sure whether any criminal activity 
actually occurred as defined by a statute passed in 1984 
a section of that law says it is unlawful to enter a government 
computer with the intent to disrupt its functions the crime is 
punishable by up to 10 years in prison 
the source said that in this case theres no evidence that 
anything was taken from the computers but rather that it was a 
question of disrupting computer systems 
one section of law addresses sabotage but the source said it was 
unclear whether the virus case would involve an intent to disrupt 
the computer 
the source said he believed the bureau was investigating the 
matter in view of the fact that there were breaches of security and 
that the justice department will have to determine whether the 
matter involved criminal conduct 
theres a lot of ambiguity in the matter the source said 
thomas guidoboni a lawyer for the washington dc firm of 
bonner amp oconnell said he had been retained to represent morris 
in the socalled computer virus matter 
we have notified the federal authorities of our representation 
and his whereabouts the lawyer said we are in the process of 
investigating the facts and circumstances which have been reported 
by the press in order to determine our course of action 
morris father robert t morris sr chief scientist at the 
national computer security center in bethesda md has refused to 
say if his son created the virus he said his son left the ithaca 
ny campus last week to avoid reporters and is staying at the 
familys arnold md home 
a team of technicians at cornell spent the weekend searching the 
computer tapes and accounts trying to track the source 
morris friends have said he created the virus as an intellectual 
challenge and that it was supposed to lie dormant in computer 
systems according to several news accounts of the incursion 
morris reportedly went to dinner after setting the program loose 
wednesday night and checked it before going to bed discovering his 
mistake morris desperately worked to find a way to stop the virus 
spread 
he called harvards aiken computation lab early thursday after 
realizing there was an error in the program he had intended to be 
harmless said ndrew h sudduth a programmer at the lab morris did 
his undergraduate studies at harvard 
he was extremely shocked and tired sudduth told the harvard 
crimson in a story published monday his tone was very sober 
computer security consultants said they had received far more 
inquiries than usual since last week however they said computer 
security troubles cannot be solved with passwords and installing 
antiviral software 
jon david a computer security consultant in tappan ny said 
businesses that had contacted him for help seemed to underestimate 
the challenge 
the amazing thing is the attitude im getting is why dont 
you stop by for a day or two and tell us how to protect ourselves 
from viruses he said
