colombias chief of police said monday 
his country cannot fight drug traffickers alone and called on 
western nations to increase its efforts to combat trafficking 
police chief gen miguel gomez padilla said in an interview that 
industrialized countries must fight drugs on all levels from ending 
arms sales to drug traffickers to tightening banking laws to stop 
drug barons from laundering their money 
to end narcotrafficking what is required is an atttack on all 
levels of the process including consumption gomez told the ap 
we need cooperation from the rest of the world to end drug 
trafficking 
he made his comments as colombian president virgilio barco was 
visiting washington to discuss the drug war with president bush 
gomez said western countries are cooperating in the drug war but 
he said the aid will never be enough 
colombia has insisted that drug trafficking is a multinational 
crime he said 
he added it is indispensible that there be strong action on 
the part of industrialized countries to attack consumption 
colombia supplies an estimated 80 percent of all the cocaine 
consumed in the united states 
maj jorge humberto martin press spokesman for the national 
police said colombia needs communications and transportation 
equipment more helicopters and more money to fight drug barons 
colombia launched a crackdown of drug traffickers early this year 
that gomez said has succeeded in reducing cocaine exports by 20 to 
30 percent 
in response the powerful medellin cocaine cartel has carried out 
a campaign of bombings and assassinations that has left an average 
of two policemen dead each day this year 
bush met in february with the presidents of colombia bolivia and 
peru and promised the united states would increase its aid in the 
fight against drug traffickers 
gomez said bush has increased us aid but said not enough 
controls have been put on the laundering of drug money 
we have insisted on the control of laundering capital and this 
has been happening but not to the degree that we would have 
liked gomez said 
on may 27 cesar gaviria of the ruling liberal party was elected 
to succeed barco of the major presidential candidates gaviria took 
the hardest line against drug traffickers

a tentative settlement was 
announced monday in a british columbia truckers strike that has 
disrupted commercial traffic at us border crossings 
but some strikers denounced it and pledged to keep their border 
blockades in place 
about two dozen us truckers who had delivered their loads in 
canada and were then stranded at the border were allowed to head 
home monday night through the blaine wash border crossing but 
most loaded trucks remained blocked there 
passenger cars buses and trucks carrying medical supplies mail 
and fresh produce were allowed through 
bryan williams the provincial governments chief mediator in the 
strike said agreements had been signed between the independent 
truckers and a fairly substantial number of employers 
the blockades have resulted in food and fuel shortages in the 
province and in point roberts a small peninsula thats part of 
washington state but reachable only through british columbia or by 
water 
the president of the western owner operators association don 
tofsrud said the independent truckers were being asked to dismantle 
their blockades 
im asking all the guys to get home and get some sleep 
tofsrud said 
but several hours later the blockade continued at blaine 
details of the tentative settlement were withheld but some 
striking truckers reacted negatively to reports theyd heard 
doug neal a spokesman for striking truckers at the blaine 
crossing said a pay demand of 40 per hour in canadian currency 
34 us was nonnegotiable 
if we dont get it were going to stay here until we do he 
said 
the truckers pay their own operating costs they presently are 
paid 26 to 35 an hour canadian about 22 and 29 us 
more than 1000 independent british columbia truckers have 
participated in a series of escalating job actions since withdrawing 
their services a week ago to obtain higher hauling rates the 
blockade of four border points between british columbia and 
washington state and along two major canadian highways began in 
earnest friday 
idled drivers at the washington state border city of blaine at 
the end of interstate 5 said monday they were growing angry and 
wanted to go home 
we got trapped up here said dick tallmadge of kent wash 
who estimated he was losing about 100 us a day in mileage 
payments 
tallmadge said he didnt understand how keeping us drivers 
hostage aided the canadian truckers 
were not doing them any good he said we are a thorn in 
their side 
were tow truckers of war said dyke stewart of raleigh 
nc 
stewart later announced the agreement that let empty us trucks 
return home through blaine he said american truckers who refused to 
let their trailers be examined to show they were empty or who were 
carrying goods back to the united states would not be allowed to 
move

threeyearold fabian maldonado was dropped from a 
federal food program because he is too healthy now his mother 
doesnt know how she is going to feed him 
another mother kellie brillhart estimates she will lose about 
200 a month from her food budget because her oldest daughter has 
been cut from the same program 
they are among some 27000 women and toddlers in texas who will 
be struck from the supplemental food program for women infants and 
children by july because of rising food costs and increased demand 
said debra stabeno program director for texas 
wic has helped us a lot said mrs brillhart 23 the mother 
of three children who are all on wic my 3yearold daughter 
lisa was cut off the program last week she came up to be renewed 
and they just said sorry she cant get back on it but shes 
been cut before i told them well ill be back in six months 
fabian maldonado also was cut from the houston program 
they told me there would be no more food voucher cards 
said his mother fortino maldonado 37 i dont know how i will be 
able to buy food now 
mrs maldonado said in spanish that her son has been on wic since 
he was an infant 
the 12yearold program was designed to curb the infant mortality 
rate and ensure that pregnant women at risk for nutritional 
deficiencies delivered healthy babies 
wic serves lower income women who are young anemic smoke use 
drugs have poor dietary habits or other problems it also is for 
poor children up to 5 years old who have nutrition problems 
participants receive vouchers they use at grocery stores to buy 
milk cheese cereal juice infant formula peanut butter eggs and 
dried beans 
but higher food costs and increased demand resulted in a budget 
shortfall this year forcing wic officials to implement cuts in at 
least 36 states 
healthy children and mothers are primary targets 
we serve 330000 people a month in the state ms stabeno 
said were not shutting the doors or anything we want to 
encourage mothers to keep their appointments even those in the 
lowest priority because they still may be eligible 
pregnant women who are accepted to the program remain eligible 
until six weeks after they deliver unless they are breast feeding 
and are reevaluated every six months infants remain on the program 
until their first birthday and then are reevaluated for growth and 
nutritional deficiencies every six months 
now when they come in for reevaluation some women are shocked 
when they are told they or their toddlers are too healthy to 
continue receiving vouchers 
what am i am supposed to have done not given my baby a 
bottle or not taken her to the doctor for shots so that she can 
continue to receive assistance said one 39yearold mother of 
three whose 13monthold baby was cut from the program last week 
she spoke on condition of anonymity 
when texas officials saw food cost increases doubling and 
tripling their budget estimates they initially cut back the amount 
of cereal and cheese for clients but now texas officials have 
resorted to dropping thousands from wic each month 
weve reduced our food package in the quantities allowed for 
younger children and postpartum women as based on the latest 
recommended daily allowance ms stabeno said but you can get 
the recommended daily allowance and still be hungry 
in houston where officials must trim 1600 people from the wic 
rolls by july director fay walker acknowledged the cutbacks will 
affect only a small portion of the 30700 city program participants 
still i think its going to affect us ms walker said 
having to turn one child away is one child too many 
ms walker said wic also brings many pregnant women into health 
clinics early in their pregnancy allowing for more prenatal care 
which also enhances the babys health 
its been proven that dollars spent in the wic program are 
dollars saved in medicaid and other programs ms stabeno said 
there have been a lot of nationally funded studies that show that 
wic helped increase the birth weight of the babies and the length of 
pregnancy and made a substantial difference in the cognitive 
abilities of the children 
diana castillo 27 of humble used wic for about five years to 
help her four children 
since im on welfare it helped quite a lot mrs castillo 
said sometimes you dont have enough food stamps to get the extra 
things the babies need

when bob crostic bought his first pair of 
stonewashed jeans recently he discovered a small chunk of pumice in 
one of the pockets 
there was more than a bit of irony in the find 
crostic a staffer with the us forest service oversees an 
openpit pumice mine in the santa fe national forest that is at the 
center of a noisy dispute about the use of public lands 
because some of the pumice is used to stonewash or acidwash 
fabric critics contend the forest is being sacrificed for fashion 
and fashion vs forest has become their rallying cry 
the las conchas pumice mine looks like a moonscape the dazzling 
white of the pumice piles offset only by a couple of heaps of 
burned blackened tree stumps 
great stuff to mine crostic told recent visitors as he 
grabbed a handful of the lightweight volcanic rock and sifted it 
through his fingers 
last spring as work began to prepare the mine site in northern 
new mexicos scenic jemez mountains about 20 members of the 
environmental group earth first converged to protest the operation 
three were arrested when they locked themselves to earthmoving 
equipment 
at issue is a 19thcentury federal law that allows private 
citizens to mine and appropriate public lands at negligible cost 
the law enacted to encourage mineral development says that 
anyone who finds a valuable mineral deposit on public lands may 
stake a claim and mine it or patent the claim and purchase the land 
while coal oil gas sand stone and other minerals have been 
removed from its provisions the general mining law of 1872 still 
covers metals such as gold lead copper and zinc as well as pumice 
copar pumice co which had staked claims in the area received 
approval last summer from the forest service to stripmine 33 acres 
in the national forest about 15 miles west of los alamos copar then 
must restore the site once mining is finished by recontouring it and 
planting grass and trees 
environmentalists went to court contending the mines impact had 
not been adequately assessed but mining continues while the case is 
pending 
in september copar owner richard cook applied for a patent or 
outright ownership of 1700 acres surrounding the mine 
under the 1872 law if the tract is determined to contain 
valuable pumice cook can buy the land for 250 an acre once he 
owns the property no state or federal reclamation laws would 
require him to restore the site after mining 
its essentially a major ripoff of public land under an archaic 
law said henry oat of santa fe who heads the east fork 
preservation coalition 
the operating mine is barely a fourth of a mile from the east 
fork of the jemez river a pristine trout stream that has been 
approved by congress for inclusion in the national wild and scenic 
rivers system 
nearly 180 acres of the land cook seeks fall within the 
quartermile corridor on either side of the river that would be 
protected by the federal designation which awaits president bushs 
approval 
the legislation prohibits cook from patenting the 180 acres along 
the river but he cannot be prevented from mining it because he has 
valid claims he has said though that he would not mine it because 
that would spoil the view from the river 
we dont intend to destroy the landscape or the area in any 
way he said from his office in espanola 
cook also said he has no plans for the 1700 acres other than to 
mine it but his opponents fear he would develop condominiums or 
other commercial ventures in the forest 
environmentalists also are worried that the beautiful jemez area 
a popular tourist destination will turn into a pumicemining center 
the copar pumice is the remnant of a volcanic explosion 150000 
years ago and is considered valuable because of its largesized 
chunks its purity and its proximity to the highway 
pumice goes into products ranging from building materials to 
toothpaste 
its use as an industrial abrasive including stonewashing 
garments to give them an aged appearance is a small but growing 
segment of the market said donna smith a mineral economist who 
lives near the mine 
copar however is not a major pumice supplier to the garment 
industry cook said about 10 percent of the mines pumice goes for 
stonewashing far less than was anticipated when the mine opened 
the garment industry just isnt taking all the large chunks 
now cook said 
most of copars pumice is used for construction he said 
industry spokesmen say much of the pumice used by major garment 
manufacturers is imported 
levi strauss amp co for example buys its pumice from turkey for 
its products that are stone or acidwashed and has cut back about 
60 percent on the amount of pumice it uses supplementing the stone 
with chemicals said company spokesman david samson in san francisco 
although only a fraction of copars product ends up in the 
industrial machines in which denim is stonewashed opponents of the 
mine have urged a boycott of stonewashed clothes 
the east fork preservation coalition and other environmental 
groups also are pushing a proposal to have 115000 acres including 
the mine site designated as a national recreation area which they 
say would stop the patent process and offer greater protection for 
the forest 
there are efforts too to reform the 118yearold mining law 
including two bills that have been introduced in congress to revamp 
it 
the copar mine is one of a series of disputes arising from the 
law and an example of why it should be changed said philip hocker 
president of the mineral policy center in washington dc 
the law says that anybody who finds a valuable mineral deposit 
in the public domain has a right to mine it no matter what the 
environmental consequences and with no payment to the public he 
said thats whats wrong with it

angolas civil war began as soon as it gained 
independence from portugal in 1975 and fighting continues despite 
peace talks associated press correspondent tony smith traveled to 
luanda and filed this report from the government side 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
by day life in luanda has been much the 
same for 15 years armed soldiers stand on street corners women 
wait in line at dismal shops for the monthly rations of necessities 
and everyone looks tired 
at night war comes to the city which less than a year ago was 
cautiously preparing for peace 
four bombs have exploded in the capital this year most of luanda 
has been dark after sundown since rebels sabotaged 44 highvoltage 
pylons east of luanda in april sporadic gunfire can be heard until 
dawn 
guerrilla sabotage has interrupted water supplies and delayed 
food shipments sending prices soaring in bustling black markets 
that are much better supplied than state stores where prices are 
fixed 
in april the curfew began at midnight and most people ignored 
it now it starts at 930 pm and is enforced by soldiers who push 
curfewbreakers into vans and take them to police stations for the 
night 
rebel leader jonas savimbi was angered by an army offensive deep 
into his southern strongholds early this year and has stepped up 
urban sabotage and bombings despite new peace efforts that began in 
april most of the attacks have been in and around luanda 
in the dusty suburb of palanca a young soldier who identified 
himself only as ben leaned against the barred doors of a darkened 
cafe and switched off the regular good morning combatant progam 
on his transistor radio 
its not just that people are frightened to go out at night 
he said theres no electricity so theres nowhere to go 
bars and discos that provide luandans with a release from the war 
are becoming scarce 
last year new bars and nightclubs began to thrive after 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire brought savimbi and jose eduardo 
dos santos angolas president together june 22 and the two foes 
sealed a truce with a handshake 
the ceasefire collapsed within days however and tentative 
peace talks broke down soon afterward 
in april lowlevel officials from both sides held the first 
discussions since then in portugal from which angola gained its 
independence 15 years ago unita has called for a new truce but 
government delegates say agreement on terms and a future agenda must 
come first 
dos santos government still avowedly marxist and backed by an 
estimated 15 billion a year in soviet military aid has hinted it 
might accept rebel demands for free multiparty elections but only 
when peace is well established 
the government doesnt want to prolong a pernicious war when 
political solutions are feasible among compatriots the defense 
minister gen pedro maria tonha said on television last month 
he said operation zebra an offensive the government says 
captured a strategic airstrip feb 2 at mavinga 700 miles southeast 
of luanda shows the army has sufficient fighting power to silence 
unita militarily 
tonha spoke at a ceremony in southern cuandocubango province 
where he decorated soldiers who fought in the campaign 
on may 15 lt col francisco furtado zebras chief of staff 
told foreign reporters visiting the southeastern military base at 
cuito cuanavale that his soldiers were withdrawing from mavinga 
because it had lost its strategic importance 
a defense ministry statement in midmay said that mavinga 90 
miles south of cuito cuanavale was firmly under government control 
and that president dos santos theatened to strangle the rebel 
headquarters at jamba farther south with longrange artillery 
bombardment 
unita claimed its fighters routed government troops well north of 
the area last week but western diplomats in lisbon the capital of 
portugal said intelligence reports gave no indication of such a 
battle 
large troop movements through the luanda airport support claims 
by western sources that two of four government battalions from the 
mavinga operation were being moved north to the new cuanzabengo 
front which starts 35 miles east of luanda it is commanded by gen 
antonio dos santos franca who planned operation zebra 
military sources in luanda say the estimated 2000 unita 
guerrillas operating in small sabotage and ambush squads around the 
capital should be no match for government ground and air offensives 
heavy fighting continues in northern uige zaire and malanje 
provinces near the border with zaire and rebels have attacked 
government units guarding foreign oil installations near the coastal 
city of soyo north of luanda 
also unita says it always can return to bush warfare making 
hitandrun attacks on areas under government control 
un observers in angola say more than 33000 of the cuban 
soldiers who helped fight the rebellion since it began in 1975 have 
returned home under usbrokered accords signed by angola cuba and 
south africa in december 1988 cuba had about 50000 military 
personnel in angola when the withdrawal began 
under the agreement south africa promised namibia independence 
and an end to its military and logisitcs support for unita 
the rebels still receive about 50 million a year in us 
military aid most of it funneled through zaire the state 
department has pledged to continue assistance until peace is 
achieved

contra rebels being disarmed in 
nicaragua say theyre putting their foot down over one request they 
dont want to trade in their soldiers boots for rubber ones 
our fight for democracy has been very dignified and this makes 
us reject this type of boots they are giving us when we turn in our 
rifles said carmelo cuadra a disarmed rebel in this guerrilla 
base 150 miles north of managua 
each contra is being supplied with a pair of blue jeans 
checkered shirt and rubber boots they say the rubber boots are not 
appropriate for the farm work many will be doing as civilians after 
a decade of war 
they are also being given food rations a medical checkup and 
safeconduct pass 
one former combatant fremio altamirano said his companions have 
been allowed to keep their jungle boots rain ponchos hammocks and 
backpacks 
the united nations which is overseeing the demobilization said 
that as of saturday 3288 rebels had turned in their weapons an 
estimated 12000 rebels are expected to be decommissioned by june 10 
violeta barrios de chamorro was elected in february ending a 
decade of rule by the leftist sandinistas her government and contra 
leaders signed an agreement calling for the demobilization to be 
completed by june 10 
the accord calls for the contras to disarm in five security zones 
around the country which are policed by un forces 
in return the government agreed to provide more than 20 
development zones where the contras can settle it provides them 
with their own police forces and with a say in local town councils 
and government departments involved in the resettlement 
it is the latest in a series of agreements rebel demobilization 
has been an offagain onagain process since mrs chamorros

when the rev donald bairds son invited 
classmates over for a backyard birthday party the childrens 
parents called one by one to decline the invitation 
eventually the party consisted of the presbyterian ministers 
son and one friend 
even as the mormon church seeks improved relations with other 
religious groups many gentiles in the mormon heartland say they 
face economic political and social sanctions or simply feel 
shunned 
i think everybody has a war story to tell said baird one of 
the authors of a utah presbyterian study of the mormon church 
signs of change exist a recently revised ritual no longer 
portrays nonmormon clergy as agents of satan for example but some 
ecumenical officials and church observers say the church of jesus 
christ of latterday saints has not entered the mainstream of 
american religious life 
mormons exclusivist claim toward truth and being gods church 
is as strong as its ever been said the head of a liberal mormon 
group who spoke on condition of anonymity thats probably the 
major stumbling block toward improving relations with other 
churches 
the issue of interfaith relations with the mormon church was 
brought to the forefront by the presbyterian church usa which 
is holding its general assembly through june 6 in a land where 
mormons outnumber presbyterians more than 200to1 
in response mormon leaders issued an appeal to set up informal 
meetings with presbyterian officials and the denominations 
theology and worship ministry unit and utah presbytery both 
submitted reports on mormonpresbyterian relations 
we believe in impossible possibilities because god has made 
them possible time and time again the national group said in its 
report calling for further dialogue with the mormon church 
the church was founded in 1830 by joseph smith based on 
revelations he said he received in upstate new york tensions with 
nonmormon neighbors forced smith to move the church from ohio to 
missouri then illinois where smith was shot to death in 1844 
after brigham young brought followers to the valley of the great 
salt lake in 1847 tension was constant between the federal 
government and the church until the end of churchsanctioned 
polygamy in 1890 and the granting of statehood to utah in 1896 
jan shipps a professor of religious studies at indiana 
university said the recent elimination of the part of the churchs 
endowment ceremony where satan hired a nonmormon preacher to spread 
false teachings is a very important signifier the lds church is 
moving away from its position that all other churches are false 
shipps also said though no official policy encourages ecumenical 
relations there has been a kind of relaxing of rules allowing 
some local mormon churches to get involved with councils of 
ministries 
a mormon church spokesman said the church has always held the 
position all religious groups should enjoy freedom of conscience 
and he characterized individual acts of unfriendliness toward 
nonmormons as isolated instances 
the church leaders encourage members to go out of their way to 
be kind to neighbors of other faiths thats our policy said don 
lefevre director of media relations 
but many nonmormons say life is not easy in a state where about 
70 percent of the states 16 million residents are mormon as are 
the governor and 98 percent of state legislators 
the report to the presbyterian general assembly prepared by the 
presbytry of utah cites one survey that found a majority of 
nonmormons believed local companies are biased in hiring and 
promoting employees and another that showed the majority of mormon 
residents were unaware of any bias toward gentiles 
one man tells of how he was greeted to his new neighborhood by 
mormon neighbors who hung up a welcome sign extending the full 
length of their house 
but others tell a different story 
laura neidert said her mormon neighbors have avoided her family 
i felt once they found out we were not lds we were shunned she 
said 
on sunday night more than 300 people from protestant orthodox 
and roman catholic churches marched from the first presbyterian 
church to the salt palace in an ecumenical pentecost procession no 
mormon representatives were asked to march 
weve invited recognized christian denominations to 
participate said parade coordinator ina white 
marchers said the parade showed local mormons they arent the 
only religious group in town 
i think it opens up the lds community that there are other 
churches that are vibrant that are alive that are witnessing in 
the united states said presbyterian howard hartog of mount 
pleasant its a great feeling 
in the general ecumenical realm the mormon churchs policy of 
aggressively seeking converts from other faiths continues to keep it 
on the sidelines of interfaith discussions according to some 
observers 
the mormons sheepstealing is offensive to all christian 
groups said roman catholic brother jeffrey gros director of the 
commission on faith and order of the national council of churches 
when someone is proselytizing you they are not recognizing you 
as fully christian i think that is the sticking point 
the mormons however have no plans to back down on proselytism 
said lefevre our philosophy is we have something so precious we 
would like to show it 
some people within the presbyterian church say much can be 
learned from such evangelistic enthusiasm the presbyterian church 
has lost more than a third of its members in the past 
quartercentury to fall below 3 million while the mormon church has 
steadily grown to 42 million members 
you cant buy a hamburger here without getting into a 
theological discussion thats fantastic baird said here 
religion is not a hobby its a way of life

rightwing whites are 
organizing and arming in a desperate effort to stop the government 
from sharing power with the black majority 
their leaders are enraged by president fw de klerks plans to 
end apartheid and say they will never accept a black government 
both white and black leaders fear the right wing will provoke 
violence that could endanger efforts to find a peaceful solution 
while the proapartheid conservative party tries to force an 
election to unseat de klerk and his national party more radical 
groups are arming for war 
extremists have raided government armories for guns neonazis 
are organizing military units and white wolf groups have 
attacked blacks 
we are preparing ourselves to meet the revolution that mr 
mandelas killers will start it will be a holy war extreme 
rightwing leader eugene terreblanche said in an interview 
referring to black leader nelson mandela 
on may 26 about 50000 whites attended a conservative party 
rally in pretoria to demand de klerks ouster the crowd cheered 
wildly when party leader andries treurnicht said whites never would 
surrender political control 
we shall not accept the threatened destruction of our nations 
freedoms but will fight to restore that which has already been 
unjustly given away treurnicht declared 
de klerk said the tactics could start a war between whites the 
conservative partys threats of revolt and resistance are 
irresponsible undemocratic and dangerous he said two days after 
the rally 
officials say a few hundred wellarmed extremists with supporters 
in the security services could launch a devastating terrorist 
campaign and attacks on blacks or government leaders could threaten 
fragile peace negotiations 
there is going to be violence said a security official who 
would not let his name be used the question is how much 
mandela and other black leaders share the governments concern 
unless the state acts immediately to stop the recent wave of 
rightwing attacks on black people the whole peace process in this 
country could be in jeopardy said the new nation newspaper which 
supports mandelas african national congress the main black 
opposition group 
many of south africas 5 million whites oppose plans to dismantle 
apartheid the official policy of racial segregation that preserves 
their privileges and denies rights to the countrys 28 million 
blacks 
a growing number of whites stunned by reforms de klerk has 
introduced since assuming office last year are turning to the 
conservative party or more extreme organizations they fear blacks 
will seek retribution and many possess weapons in a nation 
sometimes described as awash with guns 
the conservatives want whites to keep total control and blacks to 
be given political rights in separate tribalbased states they say 
de klerk has betrayed whites above all the dominant afrikaners who 
are descended from dutch settlers and account for 60 percent of the 
white population 
de klerk legalized black opposition groups in february and has 
promised to negotiate a new constitution that will lead to power 
sharing with blacks 
treurnicht claims whites and blacks cannot live together as 
equals because of cultural and other differences 
equal votes for blacks is disastrous in terms of racial and 
political stability he said in an interview 
like other rightwing leaders treurnicht insists mandela and 
other black nationalists are communists he claims mandela and his 
followers are waging war on whites 
mandela has disregarded the existence of the white nation in 
south africa treurnicht said he does not intend to recognize 
any white community in a sense that is a declaration of war on the 
whites 
he says his conservatives who won 31 percent of the vote in 
septembers white elections could win a whitesonly election held 
now national party officials admit privately the conservatives 
would stand a good chance 
the conservatives cannot force an election however and de klerk 
does not have to call one until 1994 the government hopes to carry 
out its reforms before then and show whites they have nothing to 
fear 
treurnicht who holds a doctorate in religious philosophy 
disavows violence and says his party will achieve its goals through 
the ballot box but makes veiled threats of what could happen if it 
does not succeed 
we have told mr de klerk you cannot expect a people to lie 
down if you take away their rights he said 
more extreme organizations such as the neonazi afrikaner 
resistance movement are preparing for what their leaders say is an 
inevitable race war the groups which have thousands of members 
are forming private armies 
i say to the government that if you are going to sell out the 
whites to the blacks in this unjust way we are going to fight for 
what is rightfully ours jaap marais leader of the pure national 
party said in an interview 
about 300 members of the afrikaner resistance movement dressed 
in khaki uniforms reminiscent of nazi storm troopers practiced 
shooting riot tactics and marching at a recent training session on 
a farm outside johannesburg 
women in uniforms were taught by former army instructors to use 
pistols and shotguns children played while their parents trained 
and there were family picnics under the trees 
prof janis grobbelaar a political analyst said the extremists 
believe their survival is at stake and these actions should not 
be simply dismissed as those of lunatic fringes

horst marggraf scanned the meat section of an 
east berlin grocery store and dropped a brightly labeled package of 
west german ham into his shopping cart 
i dont normally buy west german meat but i have relatives 
coming said marggraf 61 
a month before the historic economic union of the germanys east 
german consumers already are setting the stage for massive 
unemployment with their preference for western goods 
hundreds of thousands of workers are expected to lose their jobs 
as the centrally planned economy is dismantled and individual 
sectors are forced to compete with western enterprises honed by the 
laws of supply and demand 
east german makers of electronics clothing and household goods 
have cut prices up to 90 percent in a desperate attempt to compete 
with western products that are considered far superior 
nowhere are the effects of competition more evident than in 
grocery stores where a flood of western meat potatoes soups and 
sausages is eroding the vast collective farm system that typifies 
communism 
experts are conducting experiments as one of historys quickest 
economic transitions takes place 
we put east german yogurt in west german packaging put it in 
some stores and people bought it at a 31 rate to east 
germanpackaged yogurt said andries kurjo agriculture analyst 
for the institute for intergerman economic and social affairs in 
west berlin 
consumers were willing to pay three times as much and swore it 
tasted better he said 
kurjo who spent 10 years analyzing east german agriculture for 
the us embassy in east berlin said 20 percent to 30 percent of 
the east german food industry had been lost to west german firms in 
recent months 
he estimated only onethird of the 3800 collective farms could 
make it without government subsidies 
only the best those with the most flexible leaders have the 
possibility to survive kurjo said 
food began pouring in from the west in march when the two east 
german government agencies involved signed contracts with western 
distributors 
about twothirds of the east berlin stores now sell western meat 
vegetables fruit juice and milk 
the sudden competition in what was a captive market has made 
farmers perhaps the most rebellious segment of the work force 
thousands have blocked border crossings with their antiquated 
tractors they have rallied in major cities to demand limits on 
imports and government help for their collectives 
nearly 900000 east germans about 10 percent of the work force 
earn their livelihoods in agriculture 
east germany is to become a free market formally on july 2 when 
its economy and social institutions are essentially absorbed by west 
germany in the most significant phase of german unification 
kurjo said agriculture makes up about 10 percent of the economy 
and about 40 percent of the average east germans paycheck is spent 
on food 
western competition has led to a huge oversupply of domestic 
agricultural products he said there have been reports of farmers 
destroying crops and animals because of shrinking demand 
at a farm near merseburg in the south hubert hempel 42 said 
the operation was plagued by oversupply 
we must slaughter small pigs because we cannot sell them and 
cannot afford to feed them he said 
under the old system prices paid to farmers were artificially 
high and those charged consumers were artificially low the subsidy 
amounted to 32 billion marks 9 billion a year about 12 percent 
of east germanys budget 
collectives operated on the basis of guaranteed prices for their 
products and guaranteed salaries for their workers 
farmers now find distributors will not buy at the artificially 
high prices and even with lower domestic prices consumers still 
favor western products 
customers bought attractively packaged west german sausage for 
399 east german marks in an east berlin grocery store even though 
a larger quantity of east german sausage cost only 79 pfennigs 
about onefifth as much 
west german yogurt in a glossy plastic container adorned with 
pictures of fruit sells for 255 marks or 76 cents east german 
yogurt in a glass bottle with an illfitting lid costs 38 pfennigs 
11 cents 
like most east german enterprises the collective farms employ 
too many people for the amount of work to be done kurjo said the 
average for a 6000acre farm was about 350 workers 
they had a curious system of keeping as many people on their 
farms as possible because the income paid by the government was 
based on how many employees a collective had he said 
harry nebelung a 51yearold agricultural engineer in charge of 
vegetable production on a collective in saarmund about 30 miles 
south of berlin said his operation could thrive but only if it 
changed 
we have too many people he said if we had larger 
tractors we wouldnt need them 
kurjo said he was astonished to learn that most east german 
farmers wanted to keep their collectives intact rather than become 
owners of private farms 
unlike western farms whose owners often work seven days a week 
the collectives are run more like factories employees have a 
43hour week with guaranteed holidays and sick days 
they have been educated as specialists a feed mixer a 
milker kurjo said they know nothing of the economy which a 
western farmer must be expert in

the khmer rouge failed to appear monday at the 
opening of peace talks aimed at ending cambodias 11yearold civil 
war casting a cloud over the first international peace conference 
in japan since world war ii 
khieu samphan nominal head of the communist khmer rouge later 
said he didnt attend the talks because there are many problems 
the khmer rouge poses the strongest military challenge to the 
vietnambacked government of premier hun sen 
samphan had appeared sunday evening at a preconference banquet 
and posed for a photograph with the leaders of other factions he 
said on arrival in tokyo that he hoped to be able to sign a 
ceasefire accord 
but hun sens government has refused to give the khmer rouge a 
voice blaming it for genocidal policies of the khmer rouge when 
it held power from 1975 to 1979 
hun sen said he would negotiate only with sihanouk in recent 
weeks fighting in cambodia has intensified 
prime minister toshiki kaifu on monday greeted arriving 
delegations from the vietnambacked phnom penh government of premier 
hun sen and the threeparty guerrilla coalition led by prince 
norodom sihanouk at akasaka palace japans state guest house 
the talks started about 10 minutes late at 930 am after some 
hesitation and confusion over samphans absence 
an official with the khmer rouge delegation contacted at their 
hotel declined to explain what had happened we are busy and 
cannot tell you said the official who did not give his name 
japanese foreign ministry officials said the reason was not clear 
while the talks started without him samphan and several aides 
met for about 20 minutes with a key thai mediator deputy prime 
minister chavalit yongchaiyudh who is here to observe the talks and 
was instrumental in drafting the ceasefire pact 
as the khmer rouge leader left the meeting he told reporters he 
hadnt attended the peace talks because there are many problems 
he repeated that he had come to tokyo to sign the ceasefire 
i am waiting for that he said refusing to elaborate 
the truce is expected to be disregarded but the tokyo talks are 
still regarded as a steppingstone to the possibility of political 
progress to end the war 
the phnom penh government hopes the talks also will cover an end 
to arms supplies to the guerrilla factions formation of a national 
council to unite the phnom penh authorities and sihanouks 
coalition and arrangements for some form of international control 
in cambodia said hun sens spokesman chum bun rong 
he hopes that we will succeed in this meeting at least 99 
percent the one percent would be if the khmer rouge sabotages it 
the spokesman said sunday 
the 67yearold sihanouk was accompanied to the talks by the 
third member in his coalition conservative former premier son sann 
and prince ranariddh sihanouks son 
talks aimed at settling the cambodian conflict have had a bumpy 
course since 1987 when sihanouk and hun sen met in paris sessions 
have been held sporadically in indonesia and paris pointing up how 
difficult it is to bring the contenders together much less get them 
to agree 
the next scheduled cambodia peace talks are to be held in paris 
in july with the five permanent members of the un security council 
sihanouks government was ousted in 1970 in a military coup the 
prince allied himself with the khmer rouge which took phnom penh in 
1975 but then held him in house arrest while killing hundreds of 
thousands of cambodians 
vietnam invaded in late 1978 sending the khmer rouge back into 
the jungles and the country has been in a state of civil war since 
hanoi claims that it took all its forces out of the country in 
september though there are charges that vietnamese troops are still 
supporting the hun sen government

at many pop music concerts these days a 
listener can hear intricate horn riffs and vocal harmonies with no 
brass in sight and only one singer at the microphone 
the growing use of canned music and lipsyncing at concerts 
has drawn the ire of lawmakers in new york and new jersey who say 
listeners should be told if the live performances theyre paying for 
arent entirely live 
the lawmakers are going after big names artists like madonna and 
milli vanilli are among those who have been accused of augmenting 
their live shows with tapes 
the more we get into it the more i hear its very prevalent 
said democratic assemblyman joseph mecca who proposed the new 
jersey bill 
the new jersey bill would require concert promoters to warn 
ticket buyers in advertisements and on ticket stubs if an artist is 
using recordings in place of live lead vocals 
new yorks bill sponsored by republican state sen eugene levy 
goes even further it would require disclosures in advertisements 
for all music that has been recorded or otherwise reproduced 
lipsyncing isnt particularly new neither are musical tapes 
artists as diverse as james taylor david byrne and sinead oconnor 
have sang onstage with only a tape player behind them 
its complicated however by technology like synthesizers 
samplers and drum machines that give hit songs a highly mechanized 
sound that cant be duplicated cheaply if at all by live musicians 
carl freed executive director of the north american concert 
promoters association estimated that 90 percent of the rock or rap 
artists out on the road either use tapes or reproduce instruments 
through synthesizers 
dance pop duo milli vanilli winners of this years grammy for 
best new artist speak in heavily accented english between songs but 
sing with amazing clarity in concert said chris willman a pop 
music critic for the los angeles times he says its clear theyre 
faking 
a spokesman for arista records the duos label said there is 
some use of backing vocals on tape lead vocals are live the 
band is playing live the spokesman refused to give his name for 
attribution 
its a touchy subject in the music business admitting to an 
extensive use of tapes shows an inherent deception about whats 
advertised as a live show 
most people a vast majority of people dont care freed 
said but when it comes to people who lipsync 100 percent of 
their shows people do care they feel ripped off 
but those cases are unusual and promoters complain that the new 
york bill doesnt differentiate between a complete miming act and 
occasional augmentation 
in her current tour madonna does a duet with a dancer who 
lipsyncs a song that warren beatty sang on madonnas new album 
the rascals who recorded good lovin in the 1960s cant 
afford a horn section on the road so they use a synthesizer to 
duplicate horn riffs on some songs said their manager keith beccia 
beccia said the new york bill would leave many bands with several 
unpleasant options cut their hits from the show turn off tapes or 
simply avoid playing in new york altogether 
freed called the bills another attack on artistic freedom on an 
industry already reeling from a public scrap about parental warning 
labels on albums that use explicit lyrics 
both lawmakers say theyre not trying to prevent artists from 
using tapes but just want them to be upfront about it 
i would be very disappointed if paul mccartney decided he 
wanted to do a little bit more dancing on stage and started to use 
tapes mecca said i would want my money back to tell you the 
truth but i wasnt reared on mtv 
promoters say the ticketbuying public should decide whether 
canned music is good or bad if people dont like it they wont 
come to the shows freed said 
i dont think it takes away from the effect of the show 
freed said i think it adds to it theyre trying to give kids a 
reproduction of what they see on mtv so they dont have to hear an 
artist breathing hard while theyre doing dance routines

south african journalist donald woods says the 
united states suffers from a cult of conservative selfishness 
that propels salesmen into public office 
woods who wrote the biography of antiapartheid activist steven 
biko gave the keynote address saturday on the boston campus of the 
university of massachusetts 
woods who lived in exile for 12 years said american economic 
sanctions against his homeland contributed in part to nelson 
mandelas release 
i have always had faith that once the mass of americans know 
the facts they end up doing the right thing said woods who 
received an honorary doctors of humane letters degree 
he railed against the cult of conservative selfishness in 
america which he said propelled to office people who promise 
shortterm gains salesmen instead of statesmen 
still woods has hopes for young people in the united states 
i sense that young americans seem to be snapping out of the 
blight of conservatism of the past 10 years and to be keen on 
rejoining the real world and on that i base my hopes for the 
world woods said

whether confronting protesters fencing with 
reporters wading into friendly crowds or wooing the high and mighty 
of the capitalist world the traveling mikhail gorbachev wields 
personal charm as a strategic weapon 
in canada a lithuanian army deserter spoke to the soviet 
president for two minutes and came away convinced he saw sympathy 
in gorbachevs eyes 
in washington gorbachev lectured congressional leaders like 
schoolboys and at least one was caught by tv cameras nodding in 
apparent agreement 
and in the heartland sunday a beaming gorbachev plunged into 
crowds to shake hands and chat and turned the charm on businessmen 
as well 
arriving at minneapolisst paul international airport he 
immediately waded into a crowd 
my camera jammed just as he was standing right there said 
christopher morgan an air force reservist but ill have that 
etched on my memory 
later secret service agents had to run to catch up with 
gorbachev when he crossed a street to chat with minnesotans people 
climbed on portable toilets for a better view 
roger moe democratic majority leader in the minnesota senate 
shook gorbachevs hand then pulled out a pocket camera and took his 
picture 
supporters in minnesota shouted gorby gorby crowds held 
signs reading we love mikhail raisa mr gorbachev is a cool 
dude and give gorbachev the nobel peace prize 
since he rose to power in 1985 gorbachev has made spontaneous 
forays into crowds a trademark on virtually every trip abroad or 
into the soviet countryside he makes at least one impromptu 
walkabout 
with his popularity waning at home as panicked shoppers empty 
shelves in advance of price rises he appeared to relish the warmth 
of americans and canadians on his latest trip 
before his summit in washington with president bush the 
59yearold gorbachev stopped in ottawa for talks with canadian 
prime minister brian mulroney 
he spent an hour strolling along a pedestrian mall chatting with 
people behind police barricades first on one side of the street 
then on the other depending on which screamed louder and who 
managed to catch his attention with a sign a book or a tshirt 
in washington he hung out of his black zil limousine to wave at 
people lining the streets no doubt worrying his kgb and secret 
service guards 
he told people he met that he felt really at home in one 
sidewalk conversation he said all people want a better tomorrow 
and the rest is not too important 
he fielded the same political questions never losing patience 
with those challenging his stance on lithuania or asking about his 
declining popularity at home 
in return he asked either simple direct questions what is 
your job how much do you earn is it enough or ones that would 
seem to require reflection such as are you successful in life 
and what is your source of happiness 
when a man in ottawa asked whether the situation in russia was so 
bad that its leaders had to go abroad to find cheering crowds 
gorbachev laughed goodnaturedly before answering that his 
popularity abroad reflected the changes in the soviet union not 
vice versa 
imre sooar a 21yearold lithuanian who defected to canada after 
he was drafted last year startled gorbachev by yelling in russian 
come on why not give the baltics their freedom gorbachev 
surrounded by 20 security men instantly veered in sooars 
direction and the two began a spirited conversation 
while still skeptical of the kremlins intentions sooar said 
later we looked into each others eyes and i got the feeling he 
was trying to tell me something its pretty obvious he is in a 
difficult position right now but i felt he would like to give us 
our freedom 
at a meeting in the soviet embassy in washington on friday 
gorbachev upbraided congressional leaders we cannot wait for 
congress and congressional leadership to mature and extend trade 
privileges to the soviet union he said congress is a problem so 
think about it 
senate minority leader robert dole rkan was shown on tv 
nodding as gorbachev criticized israel for settling soviet 
immigrants in the occupied territories 
a news conference in washington on sunday was sprinkled with 
moments of humor when a soviet journalist asked gorbachev about his 
problems with political nemesis boris yeltsin he replied i dont 
think you have chosen the best place for clarifying our internal 
problems but cest la vie as they say 
in minneapolis gorbachev urged some of the united states 
captains of industry to help with his countrys radical economic 
reforms his audience included the heads of anheuserbusch co 
pepsico amoco corp and dow chemical co 
his charisma overcomes a lot of skepticism even mine said 
dwight opperman president of west publishing a st paulbased 
lawbook publisher with 4000 employees

a volcano on the uninhabited aleutian island of 
kiska erupted for the first time since 1969 spewing steam and ash 
thousands of feet into the sky over the bering sea 
witnesses at a us navy transmitter station on amchitka island 
about 60 miles east of kiska said they saw steam blowing from the 
4000foot volcano friday morning and watched for a few hours before 
weather obscured the view 
as far as magnitude it doesnt seem to be a major explosive 
event said victoria avery a scientist at the alaska volcano 
observatory 
the last eruption noted at kiska volcano one of 40 active 
volcanoes in the aleutians lasted six days in september 1969 
officials said 
the uninhabited island occupied by the japanese in world war ii 
and later made a national historic landmark is near the western end 
of the aleutian chain stretching from alaska toward the soviet union

mikhail s gorbachev emerged from the summit 
with the trade agreement he wants but members of congress say it 
wont do him any good until he relaxes his pressure on breakaway 
lithuania 
in fact a leading house democrat said sunday that president bush 
can expect challenges from congress on how he handled the 
ussoviet summit in general 
in other words is the congress of the united states going to 
ratify the bush approach to the soviet union which is not to jam it 
to them while theyre weak to lay back a little bit not to try to 
squeeze every drop out of that lemon said rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee 
aspin appearing on nbctv said that even before bush signed the 
trade pact gorbachev desperately sought the american president 
faced a growing unhappiness from rightleaning republicans who 
see bushs actions as too conciliatory towards the soviets 
the pot has been stirred up even more by pushing trade 
without obtaining concessions on lithuania and delinking the two 
issues aspin said 
its going to be an interesting interesting time said 
aspin he predicted potential problems as well over an agreement 
banning production and reducing stockpiles of chemical weapons 
critics say the pact is unverifiable 
even before bush okayed the trade deal conditioned on a 
loosening of soviet emigration law members of congress served 
notice they wouldnt allow the soviet union to become a 
mostfavorednation trading partner until gorbachev ends his 
economic squeeze on lithuania 
mfns a possibility but so is snow senate minority leader 
bob dole rkan said a week ago the mostfavorednation 
designation qualifies a trading partner for the lowest us tariffs 
last month the senate with bushs gop colleagues leading the 
way passed a nonbinding resolution seeking to halt any ussoviet 
trade agreements while the crackdown on lithuania continues the 
vote was 7324 
moscow slapped an embargo halting food and fuel supplies to 
lithuania after the baltic republic declared independence on march 
11 
bush in an endofsummit joint press conference with gorbachev 
said his decision to conditionally grant moscow trade benefits had 
nothing to do with lithuania 
the linkage is between the emigration and thats it bush 
declared 
bush had barely waved goodbye to gorbachev when his chief of 
staff john sununu put it differently in an abc television 
interview there is no way the president of the united states is 
not going to consider a whole host of issues as he determines 
whether or not to send the trade deal to congress sununu said on 
this week with david brinkley 
sen richard lugar rind a former chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee said what happens to the trade 
agreement once it is sent to congress hinges on a number of 
decisions facing the kremlin in a period of turmoil 
members of congress would be watching what goes on back in 
the soviet union and how they work it out in the next few weeks 
he said 
earlier senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said 
some rather modest changes in his gorbachevs policy toward the 
baltic states could convince congress to approve trade benefits 
meantime lithuania president vytautas landsbergis said sunday 
that he hopes to sign a trade agreement with the republic of russia 
now headed by populist reformer boris yeltsin yeltsin is considered 
gorbachevs political 
nemesis 
bush said he was blunt with gorbachev about us support for 
selfdetermination of the baltic states and he was encouraged to 
see discussions going on over there between various leaders 
but he said the soviet leader provided no assurances that he 
would lift the embargo against lithuania the soviets say 
independence can only be attained through a drawnout process 
involving a referendum 
while bush insisted it was in the united states best interest to 
sign the trade deal he acknowledged that congress shares a role in 
deciding its fate 
weve got a congress that has its rights he said they 
have every right to look at what ive signed and every obligation to 
do that and make their judgment as to whether its in the best 
interests 
unlike a treaty which requires ratification by a twothirds vote 
of the senate the trade pact is an executive agreement which 
requires approval by a majority of the house and senate 
one of the most vocal senators in the drive to tie trade to 
lithuania is sen alfonse damato rny who said there will be 
one tough battle in the senate on trade unless the economic 
embargo on lithuania is lifted 
but sen patrick leahy dvt argued last month that it was 
pointless to link the issues 
we need to be encouraging trade with the soviet union and other 
countries he said this is not some favor we are granting the 
soviets we are the worlds largest debtor nation

when morris udall environmentalist chairman of 
the house interior committee for nearly a quarter century announced 
plans to retire some people asked what that would mean to the 
protection of public land 
also could a man who has been a leader in congress despite a 
long battle with parkinsons disease be happy outside the 
legislative process 
udall apparently is ready to pass the torch after one more term 
in the house 
ive spent thousands of hours working to protect american lands 
and create national parks said udall i regret i have not been 
able to spend a lot of time in those areas 
he said he wants to take his bride the former norma gilbert whom 
he married last year to see the parks i would like to pitch a 
tent and stay for a while 
udall 67 announced last month that he will retire at the end of 
1992 and capitol observers believe he means it reelection this 
year should be no problem 
for 11 years the congressman has battled a disease that leaves 
ones mind intact but savagely attacks muscular reactions reducing 
the once upright and active former pro basketball player to a 
stoopedover old man 
yet udalls refusal to surrender to the illness led people to 
believe he would never leave congress voluntarily 
i am always reluctant to write out a specific agenda said 
udall but he added that before he leaves there are a few key 
areas where i can play a positive role 
he said he wants to participate in the debate on campaign finance 
reform he serves on a house task force that will handle the 
legislation now being debated by the senate 
he also said he wants to see the american heritage trust bill 
passed to assure a permanent trust fund for federal acquisition of 
lands and to improve recreational areas 
before leaving as the most senior and powerful member of the 
arizona delegation udall also plans to oversee a few more 
appropriations for the central arizona project a federally funded 
canal still under construction that provides water to arid areas of 
the state 
the project is expected to be completed soon and udall has said 
he wants to be in congress when the water finally flows to tucson 
ive spent a lot of time on that effort and my parents always 
taught me to finish what i start said the congressman 
once hes in retirement udall says hell write another book 
my latest too funny to be president was only onethird of 
my collection of jokes and stories he said 
udall was elected to the house from arizonas second district in 
1961 to replace his brother stewart who was appointed interior 
secretary by president kennedy he has been interior committee 
chairman since 1977 
rep george miller dcalif is heirapparent to the job 
miller already has been taking over leadership said rindy 
obrien of the wilderness society miller has a very keen 
environmental interest hes a hard fighter same as mo 
one of the most productive politicians of his generation udall 
also is perhaps the most popular among his colleagues his unusual 
ability to bring enemies into agreement over legislation has gained 
him admiration from all parts of the political spectrum 
we will miss having mo there because he was always someone you 
could count on said obrien

when former iowa sen dick clark launched the 
aspen institutes congressional retreats five years ago he chose a 
site not too far from washington north carolinas eastern shore 
it was just a damned disaster to be honest he said it 
was money wasted 
the lawmakers came late and left early because of changing events 
in washington just a short flight away and when they were there 
they were constantly on the phone with their offices he said 
so clark searched the globe for a solution and found several 
i found if i took people out of the country and invited the 
spouses i could get people to come he said 
indeed the latest financial disclosure forms of house members 
show the trips sponsored by the aspen institute are a favorite of 
the select group of lawmakers asked to serve on the groups panels 
on us relations with the soviet union southern africa and 
indochina 
but the aspen institute is far from alone in bankrolling the 
travels of members of congress the house records show members took 
hundreds of free trips last year visiting world capitals tropical 
islands and some of the nations finest resorts 
and while on the road many members also picked up thousands of 
dollars in honoraria but the value of the trips appeared in most 
cases to be worth more than the 2000 or so paid for speeches 
this is the last year house members can accept honoraria but in 
eliminating that perk last year the house did not restrict the 
trips lawmakers can take at the expense of labor unions trade 
associations and other interest groups that have substantial 
legislative interests 
other sponsors like the aspen institute are nonpartisan think 
tanks whose seminars are praised by members of congress and other 
participants 
the itinerary for the 1989 aspen retreats went like this jamaica 
in january bermuda in march a mountain retreat in switzerland in 
august followed weeks later by several days in dubrovnik 
yugoslavia the four seminars cost the foreign policy organization 
1 million 
i take them nice places and i think they enjoy themselves 
clark said in a telephone interview but we really work hard and 
long 
rep nancy johnson rconn said her husband and most other 
invited spouses skip the beach for the aspen seminars because of 
the caliber of the people they bring together 
yes we could not go to jamaica johnson said mindful of the 
criticism some public interest groups direct at such travel but 
one of the values of leaving the country is focus your office isnt 
constantly calling somebody isnt flying off for a quick speech 
and one of the ways to get members to come is providing them 
something their families see as a pleasure 
while about two dozen members of congress attended the fiveday 
aspen conference in jamaica another 11 were elsewhere in the 
caribbean at a conference sponsored by new jerseys fairleigh 
dickinson university on the island of st croix 
trips that didnt take house members out of the country often 
brought them to the nations best resorts 
republican rep tom campbell of california was among the guests 
of the american bar association at a meeting in hawaii democratic 
reps joe moakley of massachusetts and beryl anthony of arkansas 
visited nantucket in august for a national association of home 
builders gathering 
moakley also visited puerto rico at the expense of the national 
association of government employees union and was a guest of the 
securities industries association at the boca raton beach club in 
florida 
a handful of house members reported free trips to participate in 
charity golf tournaments 
its a respite we really enjoy said indiana republican dan 
burton who participated in six tournaments last year

improved trade ties with the soviet union are 
unlikely to usher in an export bonanza for the american farmer says 
a new report from the agriculture department 
the most favored nation status being sought for the soviets may 
not greatly benefit us farmers but also poses little danger to 
us farmers according to the report from usdas economic 
research service 
because of the limited increase in soviet export earnings with 
or without most favored nation from the united states the 
continued soviet commitment to increasing its degree of food 
selfsufficiency and the ussrs substantial need for nonagricultural 
imports little increase in agricultural imports is likely to 
occur it said 
most favored nation status would put the soviets on the same 
footing in terms of tariffs and other matters as this countrys top 
trading partners 
president bush agreed to upgraded trade ties between the two 
nations on friday pressing soviet president mikhail gorbachev for a 
new law protecting jewish emigration as the price 
american agribusiness had been pushing for such a move 
five former agriculture secretaries three republicans and two 
democrats issued a statement earlier friday urging the upgraded 
trade status they said it would help build a relationship that 
all sides can count on for the long term and be a basis for bringing 
the soviet union more fully into the world trading system 
the statement also was signed by 27 groups ranging from the 
american farm bureau federation to the importexport giant cargill 
inc as well as assorted corn wheat soybeans pork and other 
producer organizations 
usda economists in their report did cite a recent study by the 
us international trade commission that said granting most favored 
nation status to the soviets could mean an overall 1 billion gain 
for the united states but it said other studies put the amount 
lower 
usda is currently forecasting total us agricultural exports for 
this year at 40 billion and the soviet unions purchases of grain 
from this country already have made it the second largest 
singlenation customer 
the report said that us imports from the soviet union are 
typically commodities that enter dutyfree such as precious metals 
and compounds anhydrous ammonia art work sable skins and 
tractors the report said the soviets are selling the same sorts of 
goods to canada which already has granted them most favored nation 
status 
the report said the soviet union has a limited ability to produce 
the sort of consumer goods that would be most affected by lower 
tariffs 
a notable exception most favored nation status would slash the 
tariff on imports of soviet vodka between 60 percent and 90 percent 
and could lead to imports substantially above last years 19 
million 
most favored nation status would cut tariffs on soviet energy 
shipments to the united states by 50 percent to 75 percent 
however the ussr energy sector has difficulty maintaining 
commitments to western europe and other importing countries where 
little or no discriminatory tariffs now exist according to the 
report

a university of california economist says the 
real cost to consumers of the nations sugar program is somewhere 
in the neighborhood of below 500 million 
the american sugar alliance which represents us growers is 
applauding the finding from andrew schmitz chairman of the 
agricultural economics department at berkeley they claim that it 
refutes the often quoted figure of 3 billion as the cost to 
consumers of the us sugar program 
consumer advocates urge an opening up of quotas that keep us 
sugar prices above the world market and thus protect a few american 
growers from huge economic losses that would arrive along with a 
tide of cheap sugar produced in the third world 
they say the cost to consumers of high sugar prices is 3 billion 
a year 
schmitz unveiled his estimate at a recent state department 
conference on sugar markets he said the 3 billion figure is 
based on assumptions which are questionable and added that he used 
realistic assumptions to reach his conclusion 
for example he said the 3 billion estimate was calculated based 
on a world price at an alltime low in real terms he said it 
also was questionable to believe that us prices have no effect on 
the world sugar market meaning that without the american program 
world prices might rise 
he also said the estimate fails to factor in a savings to 
consumers by their switch in some cases from sugar to lowerpriced 
corn sweeteners 
the greater the degree of substitution between sugar use and 
corn sweetener use the lesser will be the impact of sugar quotas on 
us consumers he said

overcrowding in the nations jails is steadily 
worsening and part of the problem is that jails are holding inmates 
for overfilled state prisons according to the justice department 
on june 30 1989 there were 395553 prisoners held in jails 
operated by local governments designed to hold 367769 people 
according to a study released sunday by the departments bureau of 
justice statistics 
that marked a 15 percent increase from the 343569 prisoners in 
custody on the same day in 1988 when the jails had a rated capacity 
of 339633 
meanwhile the capacity of local jails expanded 8 percent between 
the middle of 1988 and midyear 1989 the study said 
the average daily population of the nations local jails for the 
12 months ending june 30 1989 was 386845 also up 15 percent from 
an average of 336017 for the same 12month period ending june 30 
1988 the study said 
the occupancy rate of the nations jails increased from 101 
percent to 108 percent between the two periods the study said in 
1983 the occupancy rate of nations jails was 85 percent and in 
1976 it was 65 percent 
overcrowding was worse in the jurisdictions that had the largest 
number of inmates the occupancy rate averaged 116 percent in the 
508 local jurisdictions that held at least 100 inmates these 
jurisdictions had 81 percent of the nations jail prisoners 
state prison overcrowding also contributed to the problem in 
local jails according to the study the study found that 88 percent 
of the 508 largest jurisdictions held 42053 prisoners for other 
authorities including 29358 inmates that had been sent to local 
jails because of overcrowding elsewhere the study said 
twentysix percent of these jurisdictions were under a court 
order to reduce overcrowding at one or more jails and 23 percent had 
been ordered by judges to improve conditions 
despite the increased overcrowding the number of inmate deaths 
declined from 469 during 1988 to 414 last year the study said the 
number of jail suicides declined from 147 to 121 
there were 19 million admissions and releases from local jails 
during the 12month period ending june 30 1989 
the average daily population of female jail inmates jumped 27 
percent between 1988 and 1989 women comprised 9 percent of all jail 
inmates in 1989 the study said 
the study surveyed local jails that hold inmates after 
arraignment usually more than 48 hours 
police lockups that house prisoners usually drunks for less 
than 48 hours were not included staterun jails and the combined 
jailprison systems of alaska connecticut delaware hawaii rhode 
island and vermont were not included in the survey

todays historic postsummit summit a 
meeting between the kremlins mikhail gorbachev and south koreas 
roh taewoo promised to be an important first step toward easing 
tensions on the korean peninsula 
the south korean president arrived in san francisco sunday 
morning and after a quick round of airport greetings spent the day 
closeted at the fairmont hotel with a group of toplevel aides 
planning strategy for the firstever meeting of top south korean and 
soviet leaders 
he met briefly sunday night with former president reagan whose 
schedule also included breakfast today with gorbachev fresh from a 
fourday summit in washington with president bush during the 
20minute meeting roh and reagan discussed prospects for improving 
seouls relations with moscow and increasing stability in the area 
this meeting will be an important step towards bringing peace 
to northeast asia and on the korean peninsula thereby ending the 
cold war in that part of the world reagan said after the meeting 
as he left seoul roh said the waves of reform now reshaping 
the world have started rushing toward northeast asia he said he 
hoped talks with gorbachev would open a new era in efforts to pave 
the way for the peace and unification of the korean peninsula 
korea now remains the only country on earth that is still 
divided as a legacy of the cold war roh said 
korea was partitioned at the 38th parallel after world war ii in 
1950 the soviet union backed the communist north koreans 
threeyear invasion of ussupported south korea that bitter war 
turned the south into one of the united states staunchest allies 
but koreans have always dreamed of reunification 
the talks are the fruit of seouls bid to woo the rapidly 
reforming warsaw pact countries aiming both to open new markets and 
to bring about an easing of hostilities with its northern neighbor 
from all indications the gorbachevroh meeting was arranged 
hastily with the blessing of the united states although it has been 
treated as a casual gettogether perhaps in deference to soviet 
relations with north korea 
there was no firm agenda and even the time the two would meet was 
unclear roh planned to fly to washington on tuesday to brief bush 
on the meeting before returning to seoul 
the 58yearold south korean leader reportedly was going to press 
for early and full diplomatic relations with the soviet union 
reinforcing seouls growing economic exchanges with moscow 
the south korean president also was expected to urge a meeting 
among the koreas and the four powers with interests in northeast 
asia the united states the soviet union japan and china news 
reports said 
north korea has an estimated 11 million troops and south korea 
has 650000 last week the north renewed its 1988 proposal calling 
for both koreas to reduce forces to 100000 armed men in three to 
four years 
the united states which has 43000 troops stationed in south 
korea has declared strong support for improvement in southnorth 
relations and is trying to improve its own relations with the 
norths government in pyongyang 
north korea has denounced the rohgorbachev meeting calling it 
a serious political issue 
for its part moscow may voice support of north koreas call for 
the signing of a korean peace treaty withdrawal of all nuclear 
weapons from the peninsula and the pullout of all us troops in 
south korea 
seoul has established diplomatic relations with every east 
european country except albania and east germany

the yellow ribbon on kit and joan 
sutherlands frontdoor knocker is now frayed and faded but that 
doesnt mean the sisters have given up waiting for their father 
held hostage five years in lebanon 
thomas sutherland a scottishborn american abducted by shiite 
moslem extremists in beirut on june 9 1985 has been described by 
former hostage david jacobsen as one strong tough scottish 
farmer 
and pessimism is not a family trait 
i think because dad is so strong and really a 
happygolucky wild ornery kind of person that its really 
difficult not to be that way kit sutherland said 
and so sometimes you reach the frustrations but we learned 
from the very beginning not to get on the roller coaster to watch 
what happens and wait until you see things 
but joan said i really think somethings going to happen 
maybe not tomorrow but maybe by the end of the summer 
kit 29 and joan 25 share a house in this university town at 
the foot of the rocky mountains sutherlands other child ann 31 
lives with her husband and daughter in california 
sutherland 59 was the dean of agriculture and food science at 
the american university of beirut and was on leave from colorado 
state university in fort collins when gunmen kidnapped him as he 
drove in a convoy to beirut airport 
his family stays hopeful by looking at the small things the 
fact that some of them have died and dad hasnt kit said 
a lot of things have happened that they the hostages could 
have been killed for she said so you have to stay optimistic 
that at least the most rational of groups the most rational of 
terrorists has him 
sutherland traveled from scotland to the united states in the 
1950s to continue his agriculture studies at iowa state university 
he met his wife jean there and married 
he became a us citizen in 1963 but retained his love for his 
native land 
he knows robert burns poems recalled freed hostage rev 
lawrence martin jenco who shared a years captivity with 
sutherland and he would recite them with that wonderful scots 
accent 
his daughters also credit the strength of their mother jean 
with keeping their hopes high 
mrs sutherland 56 teaches english at american university and 
except for visits to see her daughters has remained in beirut she 
was in fort collins finishing her doctoral thesis when her husband 
was kidnapped 
kit sutherland an animalsciences research assistant at csu and 
joan who works at a fort collins lending company say the last five 
years have not exactly been on hold 
but they have learned what it means to be hostage daughters 
its gone fast in some ways because you realize that life goes 
really fast and in that sense hes missed a lot kit said but 
in the other sense it just seems to drag by because you want him to 
finally get out its only been every once in a while that its 
difficult to keep optimistic 
the release of two american hostages in april and a recent 
report in a beirut magazine saying sutherland was ill and would be 
released soon are encouraging signs she said 
dad has never been the one to be the next one she said 
weve never thought he was the one that was coming out so this is 
the first time that weve had any indication that he might be 
freed 
the sisters plan to mark the fifth anniversary of his captivity 
at events in the fort collins and denver areas they admitted that 
anniversary dates can be stressful but said the university 
community and fort collins residents have been very supportive 
throughout fort collins yellow ribbons flutter from trees 
houses offices schools and churches 
those ribbons routinely are replaced with new ones but the 
ribbon tied on the sutherlands door is weatherbeaten 
were not taking it down until hes released joan said

after four days of superpower summitry a 
gladhanding mikhail gorbachev dashed through this midwestern 
metropolis like a traveling salesman sunday wooing street crowds 
and pitching the new soviet union to business leaders 
the soviet leader urged some of the united states most prominent 
capitalists to continue to help with his countrys radical economic 
reforms 
when we begin such a project we feel we need american business 
because it is so big he said at an evening meeting attended by 
such corporate luminaries as the heads of anheuserbusch co 
pepsico amoco corp and dow chemical co 
after a minnesota visit of about seven hours gorbachev and his 
wife raisa flew to san francisco the last stop on their american 
tour they arrived at 1025 pm pdt 
earlier in the day about 6000 people some waiting at least six 
hours stood at the state capitol in st paul just to see him zip 
past in his limousine 
gorbachev repeatedly waded into crowds to shake hands and 
exchange small talk prompting squeals of delight and chants of 
gorby gorby some admirers waved white handkerchiefs called 
gorbachiefs reminiscent of the homer hankies brandished by 
minnesota twins fans during the 1987 world series 
when gorbachev and his wife raisa stepped from their limo and 
walked the last block to gov rudy perpichs mansion for a luncheon 
most people shouted welcome but a few carried lithuanian 
estonian and latvian flags 
guests at the luncheon included perpich british publisher robert 
maxwell and whitney macmillan chairman of the minnesotabased 
cargill inc the soviets largest private trading partner 
to commemorate the visit maxwell announced the creation of a 
research center called the gorbachev maxwell institute of 
technology to be located in the twin cities area 
i see this as yet another element of common cooperation which 
seems to be emerging and developing between our countries between 
many countries of the world and at the human level too gorbachev 
said 
the soviet president told the business leaders that his country 
has spent the past five years sorting out ways to reform the 
national economy and will need help among other things with 
changing decadesold management ideas 
the important question is what kind of soviet union does the 
president and the us people want to see gorbachev asked a 
soviet union that lacks confidence that is not stable that is in 
turmoil or does america want to see the soviet union as a noble 
democratic state which is moving toward new forms of life 
he expressed gratitude for 150 joint business ventures now under 
way with companies in the united states involving food 
distribution automation medicine and farming 
american companies doing business in the soviet union will be 
rewarded with expanded business in the future he said but he 
warned that those who just stand on the sidelines who do not want 
to risk will remain on the sidelines when the soviet economy is 
prospering 
if his economic reforms are successful he said the civic unrest 
in the soviet union will end 
i think we saw a leader who admitted that his country has made 
a lot of mistakes and theyre willing to change said bestselling 
author harvey mackay who owns an envelope business in minneapolis 
his leadership insisted on having all of these major business 
leaders here said former vice president walter mondale who also 
attended the session he obviously wants them to think about 
investing 
mrs gorbachev made a separate visit to the home of 13yearold 
lisa watson an actress who visited the soviet union last year in an 
exchange with a moscow childrens theater 
before mrs gorbachev arrived at the house she made two 
unannounced stops to a mexican deli takeout and to a drugstore 
where she bought macadamia nuts and two packages of super mario 
brothers nintendo bubblegum 
gorbachev left washington earlier sunday after wrapping up his 
summit with president bush at a news conference the leaders 
proclaimed their meeting a success though they still disagree on 
the kremlins treatment of the baltic independence movement and on 
plans for a united germany 
that preoccupation with international matters was left behind in 
washington in minneapolis and san francisco gorbachev planned to 
focus on american ways that might be used to rescue the lumbering 
soviet economy 
minneapolis was festooned with red ribbons and welcome signs in 
cyrillic to greet the soviet leader and the entire visit was aired 
live on local television 
a visit to a family farm outside minneapolis reminiscent of 
nikita khrushchevs 1959 visit to an iowa farm was canceled 
khrushchev was the last soviet leader to venture into the nations 
heartland 
sundays visit by gorbachev capped off frenzied preparations 
begun in midmay greeting signs popped up in the airport and on the 
interstate companies took out welcome ads in sundays newspapers 
stores sold tshirts 
but not everyone was enthusiastic 
i dont understand the adulation this is still a man who 
represents a regime that starved tortured and killed many many 
people said martha anderson president of the ukrainianamerican 
community center in northeastern minneapolis 
minnesota has emphasized its common bond with the soviet union 
both have mining and farming areas frigid climates and a common 
heritage many eastern europeans settled in the iron range in the 
northern part of the state 
in perpichs letter of invitation delivered feb 26 to the soviet 
ambassador in washington he noted the twin cities had much of what 
might interest the soviet union corporations that are leaders in 
medical technology computers microelectronics agriculture 
healthcare and financial services 
advanced computer technology is another area in which the soviets 
hope to make great leaps in a short time and gorbachev included a 
visit to control data corp which is producing computers for the 
soviets to improve nuclear power plant safety 
the state trade office says more than 35 minnesota companies are 
doing business with the soviets control data a company for which 
perpich once worked sold the first large computers to the soviet 
union in 1968 
the trip by gorbachev who has been to new york and washington in 
earlier visits marks the first extended us tour by a soviet 
leader since leonid brezhnev visited in 1973

mikhail gorbachev stalking business for the 
failing soviet economy ventures into the west coast den of 
capitalism monday at a banquet for billionaires and millionaires 
gorbachev who arrived in california at 1025 pm pdt sunday 
will meet titans of industry in the plush venetian room of the 
fairmont hotel as he pursues investors in the soviet unions opening 
markets and seeks to position his country as a pacific rim trading 
partner 
the lunch with 150 executives from more than 100 companies 
including oil banking food entertainment airline hotel real 
estate and computer giants is of crucial importance to the soviet 
president and his audience 
the soviets need hard cash manufacturing expertise and business 
alliances as they transform their staggering centralized economy 
into one that incorporates freemarket principles 
gorbachevs sunday agenda included meetings in minnesota with 
regional business and agriculture leaders and at the 
minneapolisbased control data corp computer company 
us companies see opportunities in the soviet union but are 
worried about political uncertainty monetary problems bureaucratic 
tangles and other social and economic issues 
anybody who says theres a bonanza out there for us doesnt 
know what hes talking about said walter hoadley senior 
economist at bankamerica corp and a fellow at the conservative 
hoover institution but my concern is that american companies will 
wait until its safe then itll be too late the japanese and 
europeans certainly are probing we have already moved too slowly 
waitandsee may be the prudent thing but it may not be the wisest 
thing 
even before gorbachev arrived on the west coast chevron corp on 
saturday announced an agreement to explore and develop the soviets 
newly discovered oil field near the caspian sea its estimated oil 
reserves are more than double those of the alaska north slope 
the deal soviet and american officials said was an example of 
the commercial contacts that would flourish under the trade 
agreement president bush and gorbachev signed friday 
gorbachev has another important meeting on his san francisco 
agenda a firstever meeting with south korean president roh 
taewoo 
in addition to putting pressure on north korea to open up and 
move toward unification with the south the gorbachevroh summit 
could accelerate sovietsouth korean trade which doubled to 600 
million last year and is expected to surpass 1 billion in 1990 
the soviets desire to link themselves to the economic dynamism 
of the pacific nations said john w lewis chairman of the 
international strategic institute at stanford university where 
gorbachev is speaking before the business luncheon they obviously 
are blocked from being full participants by the state of their own 
economy but the asian countries have no doubt that gorbachev has a 
strong interest in the soviet union becoming a major player in 
asia 
the billionaires gorbachev will dine with include william hewlett 
and david packard cofounders of computer giant hewlettpackard 
co joan kroc primary shareholder of mcdonalds corp and ernest 
and julio gallo the worlds richest winemakers 
more than a dozen other guests are worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars nearly all are wealthy leaders of multibilliondollar 
companies such as apple computer incs john sculley walt disney 
cos michael eisner oracle systems corps lawrence ellison 
chevron corps kenneth derr and unocal corps richard stegemeier 
gorbachev whose reported salary of 77760 pales beside those of 
his lunchmates may be the poorest man in the room but he will be 
offering the promise of a potentially lucrative market for those 
companies willing to invest now in his country 
ive watched the soviets go from arrogance to humility said 
hoadley 73 theyve got some real problems their biggest problem 
is they have a system that is not designed to take risks weve 
gotten a lot of burned fingers over there and were reluctant to 
take risks im afraid that america is becoming more of a provincial 
nation economically at a time when international business is so 
important

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev has 
rejected israels invitation to visit and see for himself whether 
many soviet jewish refugees are settling in the occupied arab 
territories 
i will be frank the time has not yet come to go there he 
said sunday evening during a brief stop in the american heartland 
following his fourday summit with president bush in washington 
in jerusalem israeli absorption minister yitzhak peretz issued 
the invitation to gorbachev after the soviet leader threatened to 
cut the number of jews allowed to leave the soviet union 
during a joint news conference with bush at the end of the summit 
sunday morning gorbachev said the soviet union is being bombarded 
by a lot of criticism from arab states because of the recent rise 
in the numbers of jews leaving his country for israel 
unless the israeli government provides guarantees that the 
refugees will not settle in lands captured from arab countries by 
israel during the 1967 sixday war he warned the soviet union will 
consider reducing the flow 
we must give further thought to it in terms with what we can 
do with issuing permits for exit he said 
jewish emigration from the soviet union is at an alltime high 
about 35000 soviet jews have arrived in israel so far this year 
and the figure is expected to reach as high as 150000 about 1 
million soviets are seeking permission to emigrate 
israel responded to gorbachevs statement by reiterating that it 
has no policy of settling soviet emgirants in the occupied west bank 
or gaza strip where palestinians have been in revolt for 29 months 
the occupied territories are home to 17 million palestinians and 
about 70000 jewish settlers of which israel says only about 200 
are soviet refugees 
israeli leaders have repeatedly said that new immigrants are free 
to settle anywhere they wish in israel but that the government does 
not attempt to steer them to the west bank or gaza strip 
arab leaders have contended that jewish emigration to the west 
bank and gaza strip is a threat to palestinian rights and peace in 
the region 
i will tell you frankly let the leaders of israel think about 
what has been said today in washington so they dont turn out to be 
the only people in the world who dont understand gorbachev told 
reporters in minneapolis 
gorbachev said he and bush had discussed the situation in the 
middle east several times during the summit 
recent years have seen major accomplishments in turning around 
the situation in the arab countries and there is a very real 
chance of reaching agreement and unraveling this knot he added 
look theres been a lot of change in the arab position realistic 
change 
israeli leaders said gorbachevs warning violated the spirit of 
his own reforms in the soviet union 
the soviet union is changing direction and it cannot be that 
only regarding jews it would take a step that leads it backward and 
not forward to progress and freedom deputy prime minister david 
levy said 
the soviet leaders remarks also were condemned by us jewish 
leaders 
malcolm hoenlein executive director of the conference of 
presidents of major american jewish organizations said the comments 
were undoubtedly a response to the unrelenting arab campaign to 
halt jewish emigration 
but even to suggest a restriction of jewish emigration to 
israel is unacceptable hoenlein said 
the united states has both opposed israeli settlements in the 
occupied territories and pushed hard for freer jewish emigration 
from the soviet union during the summit bush signed a trade 
agreement giving the soviets valuable trade privileges but said he 
would not submit it to congress for ratification until the soviet 
legislature enacted liberalized emigration laws

selected quotes from the final day of the 
ussoviet summit 
 
president bush would have resolved an issue like this within 24 
hours and he would have restored the validity of his constitution 
within 24 hours on any state mikhail gorbachev commenting on his 
handling of lithuania and how bush would react if a us state tried 
to secede in the same fashion 
 
the linkage is between the emigration and thats it bush 
on whether the administration wants soviet concessions on baltic 
independence in addition to liberalized soviet emigration policies 
as prerequisites for a ussoviet trade pact 
 
i dont think you have chosen the best place for clarifying our 
internal problems but cest la vie as they say gorbachev to a 
soviet journalist who asked him about disputes back home with his 
political rival boris yeltsin 
 
i agree there are settlements that go contrary to the united 
states policy and i will continue to represent the policy 
reiterate the policy and try to persuade the government of israel 
that it is counterproductive to go forward with additional 
settlements in these territories bush on new israeli settlements 
in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
 
the soviet union is now being bombarded by a lot of criticism 
from arab countries either after these meetings and exchanges 
with the president of the united states of america on this 
particular issue our concern will be heeded in israel and they will 
make certain conclusions or else we must give further thought to it 
in terms of what we can do with issuing permits for exit 
gorbachev on arab complaints that jews leaving the soviet union are 
populating new israeli settlements in the occupied arab territories 
 
the important question is what kind of soviet union do the 
president and the us people want to see a soviet union that 
lacks confidence that is not stable that is in turmoil or does 
america want to see the soviet union as a noble democratic state 
which is moving toward new forms of life gorbachev speaking to 
us business leaders in minneapolis

in his first trip to the nations heartland 
mikhail gorbachev charmed and cajoled then got down to business 
the business of renewing old corporate ties and building new ones to 
revive the soviet economy 
in a sevenhour visit to the twin cities on sunday the soviet 
leader fresh from the washington summit was both showman and 
salesman making impromptu forays into crowds chanting gorby 
gorby and then urging corporate luminaries to invest in his 
country 
mrs gorbachev meanwhile took an unexpected shopping trip 
stopping at a mexican deli and a drugstore where she bought bubble 
gum and macadamia nuts but turned away a snickers bar saying 
nyet nyet im on a diet she also got some insight into the 
mechanics of capitalism questioning workers about salaries and work 
policies 
the gorbachevs flew late sunday to san francisco where theyll 
spend the day today before heading back to moscow in the evening 
their minnesota visit included a luncheon at gov rudy perpichs 
mansion a twin cities tour a meeting with more than 100 business 
and agricultural leaders and a stop at control data corp which is 
plannning to sell 32 million of computers to the soviet union to 
improve nuclear power plant safety 
a scheduled trip to the brand family farm in farmington south of 
minneapolis was canceled because of time constraints and blustery 
weather steady drizzle strong winds and 50degree temperatures 
the family however met the gorbachevs on the airport tarmac 
before their departure you could see why they are loved as they 
are theyre very personable said richard brand 
the gorbachevs also dazzled the thousands who lined up 15 to 20 
deep in some spots cheering squealing and waving white hankies 
called gorbachiefs reminiscent of the homer hankies 
brandished by minnesota twins fans during the 1987 world series 
the couple left their limousine three times to work and woo the 
crowds with handshakes waves and smiles and for a lucky few a 
word or two 
another local family the watsons had a personal audience with 
mrs gorbachev who spent nearly an hour in their home chatting 
about such matters as mortgage and food costs their 13yearold 
daughter lisa watson is in a childrens theater group that has 
traveled to the soviet union 
i felt love in that woman mrs watson said she looked you 
right in the eye and locked you right in 
not everyone was so enamored of the couple however small groups 
of protesters flashed such signs as hands off the baltics and 
gorby go home in areas along the motorcade route 
to commemorate the visit british publisher robert maxwell who 
attended the luncheon announced the creation of a research center 
called the gorbachev maxwell institute of technology to be located 
in the twin cities area 
i see this as yet another element of common cooperation which 
seems to be emerging and developing between our countries between 
many countries of the world and at the human level too gorbachev 
said 
the serious side of sundays stop in the midwest also was 
reflected in gorbachevs meeting with more than 100 business and 
agricultural leaders some of whom have longstanding relations with 
the soviet leader 
i see so many old friends who even in the most difficult 
periods of our relations showed themselves to be real business 
people he said as he looked out over the group 
noting the 150 joint business ventures under way with us 
companies he called for more partnerships in this turbulent time 
when we begin such a project we feel we need american business 
because it is so big gorbachev said 
he warned that those executives who just stand on the 
sidelines who do not want to risk will remain on the sidelines 
when the soviet economy is prospering well make sure that is 
so he said 
the important question is what kind of soviet union do the 
president and the us people want to see gorbachev asked a 
soviet union that lacks confidence that is not stable that is in 
turmoil or does america want to see the soviet union as a noble 
democratic state which is moving toward new forms of life 
as he stood at the base of the stairway to the plane preparing 
to leave for california the soviet leader was asked in english by a 
reporter mr president what did you think of your visit in 
minnesota 
his response prekrasno in russian it means beautiful

in the first debate between perus presidential 
candidates alberto fujimori accused mario vargas llosa of taking 
drugs and vargas llosa attacked his opponent for coming with his 
samurai sword held high 
the twohour televised debate sunday night came a week before the 
runoff election between vargas llosa the internationally known 
novelist and fujimori an agronomist who has capitalized on his 
japanese background and claimed it could help attract foreign 
investment to peru 
fujimori a political unknown when he launched his campaign 
surprised the heavily favored vargas llosa in the firstround 
balloting on april 8 he finished with 246 percent of the vote to 
vargas llosas 276 percent forcing a runoff because no candidate 
received an absolute majority 
but the 51yearold fujimori has since picked up support and 
recent polls show him leading by five percentage points analysts 
viewed the debate as critical for vargas llosa 54 
security was tight as more than 100 police stood guard during the 
debate at limas civic center authorities closed off most of the 
nearby downtown area to traffic leftist guerrillas have staged 
several attacks in the peruvian capital in recent weeks 
the exchanges in sundays debate were marked more by personal 
attacks than by specific policy proposals 
in his opening statement fujimori accused vargas llosas 
centerright democratic front coalition of conducting a dirty 
campaign and spreading insults against him 
vargas llosa countered by claiming that fujimori offered only 
generalities and banalities instead of specific proposals he 
said that fujimori the son of japanese immigrants came with his 
samurai sword held high 
the two candidates differed on their policies toward turning 
around perus moribund economy and controlling cocaine trafficking 
vargas llosa reiterated his campaign pledges to get the 
government bureaucracy off the backs of private business and sell 
off stateowned companies 
this is the great proposal of the democratic front to 
privatize the public sector he said 
vargas llosa pledged to reduce inflation from the current 2000 
percent annually to 10 percent within one year he also promised to 
pursue a program of crop substitution to guarantee peasants a good 
price for legal crops and wean them away from growing coca for the 
billiondollar cocaine trade 
fujimori who labels himself a centrist and independent charged 
vargas llosa with proposing a program of economic shock that 
threatened jobs and salaries 
to apply shock during a period of inflation serves only to make 
the problem worse he said 
he said he would maintain state companies and promised to 
drastically reduce inflation while maintaining salaries and jobs 
he rejected any foreign intervention in the fight against 
drug trafficking this was an apparent reference to the united 
states which has offered to send military advisers to train 
peruvian soldiers in antidrug jungle warfare 
fujimori also referred to a magazine interview in which vargas 
llosa admitted to taking drugs 
in response vargas llosa said he tried drugs when i was 14 
years old a couple of times he said he had never used them since 
in his closing statement fujimori provided the surprise of the 
evening when he held up a copy of ojo a newspaper that supports 
vargas llosa which carried a headline saying the novelist had 
scored a knockout in the debate 
how world communications have progressed fujimori quipped 
after the debate fernando viana an executive of the newspaper 
said the copy displayed by fujimori was a fake

mechanical problems are starting to 
take a toll on nasas shuttle schedule and the space agency is 
wondering whether the troubles are random or somehow related 
columbia stands silently at launch pad a this week grounded 
first by a bad cooling valve and now by a mysterious hydrogen leak 
that threatens to push its astronomy mission into july or later 
hardly a month before one of discoverys power units had to be 
replaced at nasas other shuttle launch pad an unprecedented job 
that delayed the hubble space telescopes ride into orbit 
despite the breakdowns few blame the national aeronautics and 
space administration 
imagining you can fly the shuttle without any problems is like 
trying to imagine you can drive to work without hitting any red 
lights said john pike director of the federation of american 
scientists space policy project 
david winterhalter director of systems engineering and analysis 
for nasa said the life of the shuttles the fact theyve been 
around a while may be at the heart of the mechanical problems 
john logsdon director of the space policy institute at george 
washington university says nasa should keep plugging away 
whats the alternative quitting we deal with the system weve 
got he said 
problems with the thousands of components that comprise the 
shuttles nearly 90 tons without solid rocket boosters and external 
tank normally are discovered in the hangar 
on columbia and discovery the troubles were not spotted until 
they were at the launch pads 
replacing columbias cooling valve and discoverys auxiliary 
power unit was the first time such work had ever been performed at 
the pad both resulted in twoweek delays and a shuttle launch had 
never been scrubbed during fueling until last wednesdays columbia 
scratch 
i see it as the odds said brewster shaw deputy director of 
shuttle operations for nasa its complicated hardware its going 
to break once in a while i dont get too depressed over that 
nasa officials said they do not intend to scale down future 
flight plans as a result of this years disruptions nine shuttle 
missions were scheduled for 1990 the same number as in 1985 which 
was the year before challenger exploded and put the program on hold 
for 2 years 
one of the remaining six missions possibly columbias likely 
will slide into next year 
you cannot anticipate all the problems said nasa launch 
director bob sieck 
a test is set for wednesday in which columbias external tank 
will be partly filled with supercold liquid hydrogen officials 
want to duplicate the conditions under which hydrogen escaped into 
the rear engine compartment during fueling for the scratched launch 
last wednesday 
shaw said he doubts the test will pinpoint a cause that can be 
fixed easily at the pad if so columbia will have to be returned to 
the hangar for repairs making it july before the shuttle can lift 
off with seven astronauts and the 150 million astro observatory 
columbias lastminute problems would have halted the launch even 
if more stringent checks had not been added following the challenger 
accident nasa officials said the same is true of discoverys 
auxiliary power unit failure 
nasa officials still believe each shuttle is capable of 100 
flights with a goal of 12 flights a year that would keep the fleet 
aloft until the year 2020 said keith hudkins chief of nasas 
shuttle orbiter program after that he said no one knows where the 
future lies 
if tomorrow makes the antigravity machine thats always been 
in all the comic books where you just push the button obviously we 
would start working on that the day after tomorrow hudkins said

it was hardly the picturesque picnictable 
setting the brands had labored four days to perfect but their 
airport tarmac meeting at least gave the farmers a chance to 
exchange gifts and conversation with mikhail and raisa gorbachev 
tired and behind schedule the gorbachevs canceled a scheduled 
25minute visit to the brand farm sunday in farmington about 20 
miles south of minneapolis the soviets had requested the farm tour 
as part of gorbachevs sevenhour swing through the twin cities area 
instead neighbors milked the cows sunday night so the brands and 
several family members could meet the gorbachevs at the airport 
you could tell they felt very badly they couldnt make it 
richard brand said of the airport meeting you could see why they 
are loved as they are theyre very personable 
the brands presented the gorbachevs with pictures of their farm 
and family and a basket of minnesotamade foodstuffs including 
cheese jellies and buffalo jerky the soviet first family brought 
dolls for the brands grandchildren 
they spent a lot of time with my grandson and my 
granddaughter brand said you could tell they love kids 
the brands said theyre sorry gorbachev wasnt able to visit 
their farm and get a taste of rural american life 
lets face it this is russias main problem food 
production brand said its a real serious problem in russia 
im disappointed that we couldnt show him a typical american 
average farm 
the brands who run their 240acre farm with their two sons milk 
75 cows and raise alfalfa corn and soybeans in all they have 250 
cows 
well go back to what we like best brand said after four 
days of readying the farm for their expected visitor were going 
to rest and move a little slower

gov mario m cuomo formally declared hell 
seek a third term but wouldnt promise hell complete it he refused 
to rule out running for president in 1992 
cuomos announcement sunday of his reelection bid had been 
widely anticipated and he is expected to win virtually unanimous 
support from delegates at the twoday state democratic convention 
opening today in albany his acceptance speech is planned for 
tuesday 
his republican challenger will be pierre rinfret a millionaire 
economist and political newcomer nominated at the gop convention 
last week herbert london a dean at new york university is running 
on the conservative party ticket 
cuomo told cheering supporters that his heart was in being 
governor 
the truth is matilda and i dont want to do anything else 
cuomo 57 said as he and his wife visited the convention hall 
sunday 
but he kept open the possibility hed run for president in 1992 
he refused to pledge to serve the full fouryear gubernatorial term 
that wouldnt work at all he said what would make you 
believe it 
there was widespread speculation that cuomo would run for 
president in 1988 but he decided against it 
this year state fiscal problems apparently have not deterred him 
from another gubernatorial bid 
three other democratic governors beset by fiscal problems in the 
northeast massachusetts michael dukakis connecticuts william 
oneill and vermonts madeleine kunin have announced they wont 
seek reelection this year 
facing his third straight year of deficits cuomo recently 
approved a record 18 billion tax increase package to keep his 
budget balanced that package included a 15 percent business tax 
surcharge and the delay of a scheduled income tax cut that had been 
due new yorkers this year 
the canadianborn rinfret 66 has pledged to make cuomos 
handling of new yorks economic problems a campaign issue he has 
already begun comparing cuomo to dukakis the failed 1988 democratic 
presidential candidate 
cuomo has the advantage of incumbency and a national reputation 
as one of the democratic partys most eloquent speakers he also has 
more than 7 million in his campaign warchest and a stable of 
veteran political operatives led by son andrew cuomo 
cuomo and rinfret both advocate abortion rights but disagree on 
capital punishment cuomo eight times has vetoed legislation to 
restore the death penalty in new york state rinfret has called for 
the electric chair to be used against murderers and major drug 
dealers 
in 1982 cuomo pulled a major upset when he beat thennew york 
city mayor edward koch for the democratic gubernatorial nomination 
cuomo narrowly defeated millionaire republican businessman lewis 
lehrman in the general election 
cuomo gained national prominence in 1984 when he delivered a 
rousing keynote address at the democratic national convention two 
years later he won reelection to a second term as governor with a 
record 65 percent of the vote to 32 percent for republican andrew 
orourke

a typical american family with four kids 
and a dog shared coconut macaroons with raisa gorbachev around their 
dining room table and said the moment was too wonderful to 
bother taking photographs 
it exceeded anything we could have expected we wont sleep for 
a week said steve watson 39 
the watsons chatted about family finances with mikhail 
gorbachevs wife during her visit sunday part of the gorbachevs 
sevenhour stopover in minnesota 
the visit to the white stucco home with green awnings was 
supposed to last 20 minutes but the soviet first lady stayed an 
hour 
i think for the same reason that we wouldnt take autographs 
we didnt need pictures it was too wonderful an experience 
watson said 
i think she is wonderful declared 13yearold lisa watson 
whose performance as part of a childrens theater exchange in moscow 
last year helped lead to her family being chosen as mrs gorbachevs 
hosts 
wearing a red and white striped dress and a bow in her hair lisa 
greeted mrs gorbachev in russian and gave her a bouquet and a hug 
on the sidewalk before introducing her parents sister and two 
brothers 
karen watson 38 said mrs gorbachev put everyone at ease right 
away she had all of the press people sit on the floor and said 
lets have a private chat said mrs watson an obstetric nurse 
watson an elementary school art teacher praised mrs 
gorbachevs ability to communicate despite the language difference 
she would reach out her hand and it was almost like that was a 
third language i really liked holding that hand it was a beautiful 
hand he said as his wife began to laugh 
ill tell you i felt love in that room said mrs watson 
lisa wound up with a pen pal i told her that i would like to 
go back and she seemed happy about that she gave me her address so 
i can write to her she said 
an estimated 6000 people jammed yards sidewalks and streets and 
even climbed trees for a better view of mrs gorbachev as she 
arrived 
the watsons had been recommended to gov rudy perpichs staff as 
a typical middleclass family by jon cranney artistic director of 
the childrens theater co of minneapolis which took part in the 
theater exchange 
still the family is hardly typical lisa and 11yearold sister 
stephanie appeared in an abc miniseries filmed in the twin cities 
the voices within the lives of truddi chase 
the family also includes 7yearold tom 6yearold will and dog 
bonnie who was kept out of sight during the visit 
mrs gorbachev inquired about the familys income and food budget 
and asked whether they had completed payments on their home 
she went to the back door looked out and wanted to know if 
that was all of our yard and if that was our garage which the 
secret service men were all in mrs watson said 
earlier mrs gorbachev paid unscheduled visits to a mexican 
takeout and a drugstore where she picked up macadamia nuts 
super mario brothers nintendo bubblegum and insight into the 
capitalist system 
does your salary depend on the merchandise you sell she 
asked employees she also asked how much vacation time employees are 
given 
the soviet first lady was curious about the contents of a 
snickers bar but in the end she rejected the candy nyet nyet 
she said im on a diet

shouts of gorby gorby and a mr 
gorbachev is a cool dude sign helped lure mikhail gorbachev away 
from his official escorts and onto minnesota streets not that he 
really needed any urging 
the soviet president lived up to his reputation for spontaneously 
wading into crowds sunday despite the presence of protesters whose 
chants competed with cheers from most onlookers 
thank you all for your feelings gorbachev said through an 
interpreter during one handshaking foray in st paul i wish 
happiness and wellbeing to the people of minnesota and this state 
at one stop gorbachevs wife accepted from an onlooker a 
handpainted sign that read we love mikhail raisa 
ive never seen any reception like that for a political 
figure said gov rudy perpich 
gorbachev smiled and often stopped to say a few words 
my heart started pounding so fast said jan michel of 
hopkins who shook gorbachevs hand he said a word but we dont 
know what it was said michel part of a 77member bellringing 
group that performed as the gorbachevs arrived 
when the gorbachevs first emerged from their limousine near the 
governors mansion they approached a group of about 200 protesters 
but did not talk to them the protesters flew flags of lithuania 
latvia and estonia 
hes a very charming man but you have to remember he does have 
iron teeth said protester karin berkholtz 
others demonstrated against soviet involvement in afghanistan 
vietnam and ethiopia and soviet treatment of jews 
police had to scramble as gorbachev jumped out of his limousine 
or crossed a street to shake a hand at the state capitol however 
some 6000 supporters and demonstrators who had waited up to seven 
hours got only disappointment 
gorbachev stuck his hand out his car window and waved but his 
motorcade didnt even slow many people ran the length of the 
capitol lawn leaping hedges and jumping curbs to get a look 
it did go pretty fast said shelly hanson who with her 
husband son daughter and nephew made the 2hour trip from 
alexandria and waited two hours for the motorcade 
obviously it would have been nicer if he shook hands with some 
people here but we would make the same trip again we got such a 
good look and him it made him seem so real we were pretty 
excited

the social democratic party has dissolved itself 
after nine years of trying to create a moderate third force in 
british politics 
you have to realize sadly that our membership is not large 
enough to lay claim to be a democratic party party leader david 
owen told reporters sunday after the partys national committee 
voted 175 to suspend its constitution 
owen said party membership had collapsed to 6200 from a peak 
68000 soon after the social democrats were launched in january 
1981 party organizers said a number of members had not paid dues 
for the year 
owen is one of three legislators the party has in the 650member 
house of commons the three will continue to hold their seats as 
independent social democrats 
owen and three other former cabinet ministers then leading 
members of the labor party had formed the new party promising to 
break the mold of british politics 
they sought the middle ground between the dominant conservative 
and labor parties hoping to eventually displace labor which they 
accused of going too far to the left 
many analysts predicted labor would never achieve power again 
after prime minister margaret thatcher and her conservatives won a 
second general election victory in 1983 then consolidated it in 
1987 
but the social democrats not only never got within sight of their 
target they never even managed to displace the old centrist liberal 
party with whom they formed an uneasy alliance that won 22 
parliamentary seats in the 1987 general election 
owen refused to merge with the liberals but a majority of his 
party agreed and formed the social and liberal democrats david 
sainsbury a grocery chain multimillionaire told owen he was no 
longer willing to continue his financial backing of the fading party 
meanwhile labor has undergone a rejuvenation under leader neil 
kinnock 
it has dumped leftist policies and extreme leftist members and 
benefited from a slump in popularity for mrs thatchers governing 
conservatives stemming from inflation cuts in the national health 
service and a new tax to finance local services levied on all adults 
instead of just property owners

many defense lawyers in capital punishment cases 
in the south are inexperienced in handling such cases a law 
publication reported today 
the national law journal which studied nearly 100 deathpenalty 
cases in six states also said standards for appointing lawyers to 
poor defendants are inadequate or nonexistent 
texas mississippi and florida have no statewide standards 
georgias are not enforced by courts or the law and louisianas 
allow for the appointment of lawyers with no experience in criminal 
law it said 
lawyers requests for money to hire investigators and experts 
often are denied the journal added 
the weekly publication studied cases in alabama florida 
georgia louisiana mississippi and texas in which nearly 80 
percent of the executions in the united states have been carried out 
since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976 
of 60 lawyers interviewed who had clients on death row half of 
them said it was their first such case the journal said 
the law newspaper also said it checked the professional records 
of about 1000 trial lawyers in states that have handled capital 
punishment cases since 1976 and found that deathpenalty lawyers 
were more likely than other lawyers to have been disciplined 
but the disciplinary actions ranging from minor reprimands to 
disbarment were not necessarily related to the capital punishment 
cases it said 
in louisiana 89 percent of the capitalpunishment lawyers who 
were checked had undergone some form of professional discipline 
compared with 019 percent of all louisiana lawyers the report said

robert noyce an inventor of the computer 
chip that revolutionized electronics and helped usher in the 
information age has died of a heart attack at 62 
the computer pioneer died sunday at seton medical center 
working separately in the late 1950s noyce and jack s kilby 
invented the integrated circuit which made possible rapid gains in 
computer technology by putting the power of multiple transistors on 
a single tiny chip 
computer chips or semiconductors are used in everything from 
personal computers and pocket calculators to microwaves and medical 
equipment 
very few things have changed the world as dramatically as the 
integrated circuit said robert m white president of the 
national academy of engineering the development of the integrated 
circuit was the single most important event that helped to usher in 
the information age 
noyce was a founder in 1968 of intel corp the nations 
thirdlargest semiconductor producer 
in 1988 he was appointed chief executive and president of 
sematech the governmentindustry group set up to help the united 
states recover world leadership in semiconductor manufacturing from 
the japanese 
noyce was a legend within the electronics industry spokesman 
jim jarrett said from intels santa clara calif headquarters 
bob was an instrumental figure in creating what has become a 
50 billion industry and semiconductors are the driving force 
behind a 500 billion electronics industry said stan victor

manufacturing is essential to the nations economic and military 
security he said us companies must adopt the cooperative 
practices of their japanese competitors to regain it

jewelry guns and guitars are the most common 
wares look around stanton myersons pawnshop and youll also find 
a telescope a diabetes monitor and a television marked prison 
approved 
a steady stream of visitors moved through the store on a recent 
weekday afternoon in this economically depressed city near 
philadelphia some were seeking loans some were buying goods left 
as collateral and never reclaimed 
basically its bluecollar people who live from paycheck to 
paycheck who need at times extra funds to carry them over to the 
next paycheck said myerson owner of lous loan inc in chester 
and upper darby 
although widely overlooked by policymakers and researchers 
pawnshops are an important but costly source of credit to the poor 
according to a recent study by swarthmore college economics 
professor john p caskey and student brian j zikmund 
millions of americans borrow about 50 at a time typically 
reclaiming their goods in two to three months the study found they 
pay interest and fees ranging from an annual 36 percent in 
pennsylvania and new jersey to 240 percent in oklahoma 
most pawnshop customers come from lowincome economic groups 
and are probably ineligible for bank or finance company credit 
caskey and zikmund write in the federal reserve bank of kansas 
citys economic review journal 
pawnshops are on the rise in response to bank deregulation 
falling real wages for production workers and a growing poverty 
rate the researchers say they deal in smaller amounts than 
traditional lenders like to handle and are seeking enhanced 
respectability in suburban shopping centers 
most pawnbrokers own perhaps two or three shops cash america 
investments a fort worth texasbased company with 100 pawnshops in 
three states is traded on the american stock exchange 
policymakers obviously dont think a lot about pawnshops 
caskey said in an interview theres a great deal of attention to 
banks and now of course savings and loans but theres a 
phenomenon growing here that people arent aware of i think they 
ought to be paying some attention to it 
an estimated 6900 pawnshops provided about 689 million in loans 
in 1988 the study said the amount was less than 01 percent of the 
nations 744 billion outstanding consumer credit that year 
but at an average of 50 each some 35 million loans were spread 
among as much as 10 percent of the nations adults allowing for 
multiple loans to some customers 
during the 1980s the pawnbroking industry grew in almost all 
states for which data could be obtained the researchers say 
there is a movement now among pawnbrokers to try to clean up 
their image caskey said theyre trying to move out to the 
suburbs provide welllit very clean professionally managed 
stores with squeaky clean images 
he said he found little evidence to back up the popular 
perception that pawnshops are fronts for stolen goods obviously 
it happens but its very rare he said 
pawnshops must register pawned goods and the names of individuals 
pawning them with police authorities can seize stolen items 
costing the brokers both their collateral and the loaned money 
in oklahoma just 015 percent of pawned goods were confiscated 
by police as stolen property the study said 
state and local governments regulate how much pawnshops can 
charge for interest storage and insurance in more than half the 
states pawnshops can levy an effective 120 percent interest rate or 
more on the averagesized loan the researchers say 
state and local laws also determine what can be pawned in 
delaware false teeth and artificial limbs are offlimits 
pennsylvania pawnshops must see proof of ownership before accepting 
workers tools

a soviet helicopter pilot being treated for 
radiation damage from the chernobyl disaster got a getwell note 
from mikhail gorbachev praising him as a national hero who risked 
his life in the line of duty 
the note to anatoly grishchenko was delivered sunday by yuriy 
osipyan a member of the soviet presidents council and vice 
president of the soviet academy of sciences 
grishchenko is recuperating at the fred hutchinson cancer 
research center where he underwent a bone marrow transplant april 
27 
osipyan who is traveling with gorbachev on a us tour following 
the summit with president bush said grishchenko was looking well 
and praised him as our national hero 
in the handwritten note translated by osipyan gorbachev told 
grishchenko all the people know that you didnt spare your life 
in the line of duty 
grishchenko stood up inside a plastic isolation tent which 
protects him from infection and chatted for about 20 minutes 
osipyan said 
grishchenko 53 developed a preleukemia condition after flying 
through hot radioactive gases to dump sand and wet concrete on the 
stricken reactor at chernobyl which exploded in 1986 the accident 
was blamed for at least 31 deaths 
after arriving two months ago grishchenko underwent radiation 
and chemotherapy to kill his bone marrow which produces blood 
cells he then received a transfusion of marrow taken from a woman 
in besancon france 
despite a mouth inflammation and a lung infection common among 
transplant recipients grishchenko has shown no signs of rejecting 
the donor marrow said dr patrick beatty who heads fred 
hutchinsons unrelated transplantation program 
were very pleased with how hes doing beatty said 
most transplant patients stay in the hospital about 100 days 
before moving to hospitalowned apartments nearby as outpatients 
while doctors dont consider a patient cured until five years of 
remission all signs we have now point to a recovery said dr 
robert hansen center associate director 
the soviet government paid for grishchenkos transplant 
including the 185000 required to be deposited before the procedure 
begins beatty said

mikhail s gorbachev had to travel all the way to 
the united states for soviet tv viewers to get a rare glimpse of 
their president in a more casual setting 
the 59yearold kremlin chief was shown saturday and sunday on 
soviet tv driving a golf cart at camp david md the american 
presidential retreat with president bush at his side 
in the past soviet summit coverage has included only the formal 
comments made by the leaders 
but in a break with tradition soviet television carried bushs 
and gorbachevs informal remarks to reporters before and after their 
meetings 
the added comments appeared designed to stress to soviet viewers 
that their president would not be coming back to moscow emptyhanded 
the midday soviet television news broadcast today showed 
gorbachev touring the control data corp computer plant in 
minneapolis and meeting with capitalists it also showed him amid 
crowds of wellwishers on minneapolis streets 
gorbachevs us trip has dominated regularly scheduled newscasts 
on government television 
television also has interrupted regular programming to carry 
special broadcasts of gorbachevs activities and a regular summit 
feature called american diary including feature reports about 
american life 
some of the tv commentary has pointedly drawn attention to 
changes in international relations under gorbachev 
only five years have elapsed since gorbachev held his first 
summit with thenpresident ronald reagan in geneva switzerland the 
soviet announcer said as gorbachev prepared to board a helicopter 
that would carry him from the washington mall to andrews air force 
base en route to minneapolis 
and how many changes there have been both in our relations with 
the united states and in world politics overall how unrecognizable 
the world has become in these years the announcer said just 
before a 21gun salute marked gorbachevs departure from washington 
none of the soviet television coverage has contrasted gorbachevs 
triumphs abroad with his troubles at home although broadcasts did 
carry his answers to us questions about the soviet economy and 
ethnic unrest 
sundays tv highlight was a live hourlong broadcast of 
gorbachevs news conference with bush 
it included reporters probing questions about gorbachevs 
opposition to allowing a united germany to join the north atlantic 
treaty organization emigration of soviet jews to occupied 
territories and his sanctions against secessionist lithuania 
other special broadcasts have included gorbachevs arrival 
ceremony in washington and his talk friday with american writers 
scientists and other dignitaries at the soviet embassy in washington 
soviet newspapers also have played up the summit pravda the 
paper of the communist party central committee has carried daily 
frontpage stories 
on sunday just below the masthead pravda headlined its summit 
coverage a step to a safe future a blackandwhite tass 
photograph showing a smiling bush and gorbachev standing side by 
side was splashed across the fold of page one 
the presidential wives have not been left out of the coverage 
either 
raisa gorbachev was shown touring an exhibition of russian 
manuscripts at the library of congress in washington and joined by 
barbara bush kissing children and speaking to students at 
wellesley college in massachusetts 
peoples diplomacy the tv correspondent called it 
not all was perfect in the tv coverage however 
gorbachevs remarks to huge crowds that flocked to him during two 
unscheduled stops on the streets of washington were not audible the 
message was all visual gorbachev shaking hands and americans 
cheering for him

a pocketsized spray version of cayenne pepper is 
being used by growing numbers of police agencies to temporarily 
disable drunks drug addicts and snarling dogs the devices 
manufacturer says 
gardner whitcomb owner of capstun inc said his companys 
sales have quadrupled this year to more than 1 million 
more than 1000 police agencies have switched from mace to 
capstun since the fbi decided to switch to the pepper spray last 
fall the denver post reported today 
women concerned about a 57 percent surge in rapes in the denver 
area over the past year also are turning to capstun but some 
denver police officials have doubts about its effectiveness 
unless it hits you right in the open eyes it takes too long to 
incapacitate you said sgt dave abrams supervisor of the denver 
police departments swat team ive seen it take more than a 
minute 
whitcomb said denver police spray at too close a range to allow 
formation of a mist that can be inhaled 
a maryland chemist developed the spray 20 years ago when his 
wife summoned to court to testify about a holdup she witnessed 
wanted nonlethal protection against thugs who threatened her life 
capstun is supposed to stop dogs and intoxicated or drugged 
criminals who often are unaffected or angered by mace the pepper 
attacks membranes inside the nose 
the spray does not have lasting effects promising reduced 
brutality charges against police

talks aimed at reaching agreement on a ceasefire in 
cambodias 11yearold civil war recessed after just 25 minutes 
today when the khmer rouge representative failed to appear 
japanese foreign ministry officials awaited contact from the four 
warring factions on a resumption of the first peace conference held 
in japan since world war ii but prospects did not appear 
encouraging 
the khmer rouge militarily the strongest group in the loose 
threeparty guerrilla coalition fighting the vietnaminstalled 
government of premier hun sen had said it came to tokyo ready to 
sign a ceasefire accord 
but it said it could not participate in negotiations that it 
described as twosided peace talks led by hun sen and prince norodom 
sihanouk head of the guerrilla coalition 
hun sen has refused to accept the khmer rouge as a potential 
equal participant in an interim government suggesting the radical 
communists could return to power and preside over another reign of 
terror 
previous cambodian peace talks also have floundered over a future 
government role for the khmer rouge hundreds of thousands of 
cambodians died during the khmer rouges 19751979 rule when it 
tried to turn the country into a primitive agrarian commune 
vietnam invaded the country and drove the khmer rouge from power 
it claims to have withdrawn all its troops from the country last 
fall 
japanese foreign ministry officials speaking on condition of 
anonymity said they could not comment on the reasons for the recess 
in todays brief talks or their content 
everything now is stagnant because of this question one 
said asked about prospects for the talks resumption he said we 
dont know yet and we dont know yet what happened today 
after the talks recessed the participants continued to hold 
informal discussions in other rooms of the akasaka palace the 
ministry officials said 
japan agreed to a suggestion from thailand in april that it act 
as host to talks between hun sen and sihanouk to maintain momentum 
in the cambodian peace process but sihanouk said the khmer rouges 
nominal leader khieu samphan and conservative former premier son 
sann leader of the third guerrilla faction also should take part 
japanese officials prepared a circular negotiating table that 
they hoped would solve the problem of a negotiating format with 
japanese foreign minister taro nakayama surrounded on one side by 
hun sen and three representatives of his government and on the 
other by sihanouk son sann sihanouks son prince ranariddh and 
khieu samphan 
but the khmer rouge said the formula still resulted in talks 
between two sides not among four warring parties 
also in tokyo to observe the talks was thai defense minister 
chavalit yongchaiyudh a key mediator between the cambodian groups 
who was instrumental in drafting the proposed ceasefire 
while other faction leaders were meeting in akasaka palace khieu 
samphan paid a 20minute visit to chavalits hotel room in another 
part of tokyo 
both sides refused to comment on their discussions but the khmer 
rouge leader told reporters afterward he had boycotted the peace 
talks because there are many problems 
im here to sign the peace agreement he said 
sihanouk has repeatedly pledged he will sign a ceasefire 
agreement in tokyo regardless of what happens but also has said the 
khmer rouge should be included 
fighting has intensified in cambodia in recent weeks with the 
guerrillas claiming victories in many parts of the country the 
ceasefire agreement scheduled for signing in tokyo reportedly has 
no measures for supervising a truce or new elections 
the five permanent members of the un security council the 
united states the soviet union britain france and china are to 
hold talks on cambodia in paris in july 
the united nations has recognized the guerrilla coalition as the 
legitimate government of cambodia and hun sen has therefore 
resisted un participation in peace plans

although president bush and soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev remain at odds over the future alignment of a 
unified germany leaders of the two germany states say the 
superpower summit has improved conditions for merging their 
countries 
west german chancellor helmut kohl said sunday that the 
washington summit has further improved the international 
conditions for the unity process between the germanys 
his foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and east german 
prime minister lothar de maiziere also said they saw the summit as 
improving conditions for german unity and disarmament 
the resolution of the uttermost aspects of german unity 
requires new and farreaching progress in the csceprocess in 
disarmament and in the overall cooperation between west and east 
especially in the area of economics kohl said in a statement 
the csce or 35nation conference on security and cooperation in 
europe deals with military security economic cooperation and human 
rights 
kohl said progress in reducing longrange nuclear weapons the 
beginning of a worldwide ban on chemical weapons and the ending of 
nuclear testing were equally important 
in addition kohl said us readiness to expand trade with the 
soviets was of psychological importance to promote the reform 
politics of president gorbachev 
in an interview with west german tv genscher called the summit 
a great success with its positive aspects that will also have 
positive results on the developments in europe 
and that means also for the europeans and the unification of 
germany because relations of the two superpowers with each other 
have fundamentally improved 
de maiziere also interviewed by west german tv said the summit 
showed the superpowers were rethinking their approach to security 
the deciding message that i think i heard is that in the area 
of stabilizing security they are having new and very different 
ideas de maiziere said of bush and gorbachev 
they are trying not to define the security theme militarily 
not end it with rocket counting but with considerations of 
economic ties with cultural ties de maiziere said 
during their summit bush and gorbachev signed a treaty that 
drastically slashes chemical weapons the two leaders also issued a 
statement breaking the deadlock on efforts to reduce longrange 
nuclear arms 
in addition secretary of state james a baker iii and his soviet 
counterpart eduard shevardnadze have indicated that prospects for 
reduction of conventional forces in europe had improved 
the soviet union had been balking at a plan to cut the 
superpowers troops to 195000 for each side in central europe 
gorbachev concerned about the military strength of a united 
germany has opposed bushs demand that the new nation be a full 
member of nato the issue was discussed extensively on thursday the 
first day of the summit but was set aside so the leaders could 
focus on other matters 
at their joint news conference sunday bush said he and gorbachev 
had a better understanding of their differences on the issue of 
german alignment but im not sure we narrowed them bush said 
gorbachev had threatened to review the soviet defense strategy 
and delay the pullout of soviet troops from eastern europe if a 
united germany insists on joining the north atlantic treaty 
organization 
baker was to give genscher a full report in copenhagen denmark 
during a meeting that began today of the conference on security and 
cooperation in europe 
as of july 2 the two german nations will start to merge their 
economies and the west german mark will replace the virtually 
worthless east german currency 
east germanys first noncommunist government came to power after 
elections in march following the ouster of hardline communist 
leaders late last year

thomas baal sent love to his parents 
before he was put to death by lethal injection it was an execution 
he fought for over his parents court objections 
baal 26 was executed sunday for fatally slashing a las vegas 
bus driver his parents had tried to intervene saying he was 
mentally incompetent and should not have been allowed to decide for 
himself to die or appeal 
send my love to my mama and my papa nevada state prison 
warden pete demosthenes quoted as baals last words 
state prison director ron angelone said baal told him to tell his 
parents edwin and doris baal of mesa colo that jesus was 
taking him home and he was not scared 
the execution came 10 hours after the us supreme court voted 
54 to allow it 
at baals parents request and over his objections the 9th us 
circuit court of appeals in san francisco had stayed the execution 
saturday saying a lower court erred in not holding a hearing on 
whether baal was mentally competent to appeal the supreme court 
majority held there was no basis for that conclusion 
baal was executed for the feb 26 1988 killing of bus driver 
frances maves 34 she was robbed and stabbed while inspecting her 
bus at an airport in las vegas 
according to baal she gave him 20 when he asked for money but 
he demanded more and a struggle ensued you shouldnt have done 
that he said according to his confession now you pay i 
sentence you to death 
before the execution got under way baal looked through viewing 
windows at the 24 witnesses and tried to speak to dan seaton the 
prosecutor in the case seaton said he couldnt make out what baal 
was saying 
after that baal appeared to talk to himself then closed his 
eyes as the lethal injections began 
baal spent a sleepless night in a cell next to the death chamber 
and made a last confession to the prison chaplain prison spokesman 
glen whorton said 
he was glad it was finally going forward and he started to make 
phone calls to friends and relatives whorton said 
andy anderson of reno an opponent of abortion and capital 
punishment was one of several people protesting the daybreak 
execution he knelt for two hours on the hood of his car in the 
parking lot outside the prison 
a votive candle on the hood beside him was blown out by a gust of 
wind just like the life that was snuffed out this morning he 
said 
baals execution was nevadas fifth and the 129th nationally 
since the us supreme court in 1976 cleared the way for states to 
resume use of the death penalty

weeks after winning a statewide 
teacheroftheyear award eleanor larrabee was called out of the 
classroom and told she was losing her job to budget cuts 
the city council has since won her a reprieve 
it took two minutes i was mute i could only nod said mrs 
larrabee recalling how westfield school authorities told her last 
month she was being bumped from the job by a middleschool 
teacher with greater seniority 
in march she had been named the top teacher in massachusetts by 
junior achievement a group that fosters entrepreneurship in young 
people she also finished fourth in the organizations national 
competition 
mrs larrabee and 41 other city teachers were handed layoff 
notices when the school committee proposed cutting 120 jobs out of 
nearly 650 in the district the committee also proposed eliminating 
athletics and busing for students living within two miles of school 
cuts are necessary because the schools 20 million operating 
budget is being cut by 22 million local government districts 
around massachusetts are grappling with cuts because of a state 
budget crisis 
but the way the school committee proposed to make up the 
shortfall was too much for the city council 
it condemned the schools decision as irresponsible and voted 
92 thursday to send back the proposed budget the council ordered 
the school committee to reorder its spending priorities so no 
teachers would be let go 
school superintendent william c allard said he couldnt make the 
cuts in any other way we are not crying wolf he said the 
school committee is due to meet tuesday to discuss the councils 
order 
mrs larrabee said it would be wonderful if the council 
action would help her and other teachers keep their jobs 
she had worked in a bank for 18 years before becoming a teacher 
at westfield high five years ago she said her experience in what 
she calls the real world aided her development of innovative

morton field the family attorney private services were scheduled 
for today he said 
he truly revolutionized lingerie in this country said ellen 
appel a publicist when other people were making traditional 
white boring lingerie he was making very glamorous lingerie 
peignoirs baby dolls 
born in new york city mellinger got his start when he lied about 
his age then 14 to get a clerical job at an intimate apparel 
firm it was there that he learned the art of mailorder 
merchandising 
in 1946 he opened fredericks fifth avenue in new york a 
mailorder business selling products that his world war ii army 
buddies told him they would like to see their girlfriends wear 
a year later mellinger moved the store to los angeles over the 
next four decades the bright purple art deco headquarters on 
hollywood boulevard became a landmark 
in the 1960s mellinger began to open outlets in malls there are 
now 160 stores and sales reached more than 80 million last year 
said ms appel 
mellinger was the guiding spirit of the company designing 
brassieres with names like rising star and cadillac and 
teaching himself french spanish and german in order to work with 
european suppliers 
fredericks explicit catalogs offering scantilyclad models sex 
toys body oils and xrated videos were mailed to thousands of 
american homes making fredericks of hollywood a household name 
from the sexkitten 50s women moved into the liberated 60s and 
70s but fredericks continued to offer its collection of padded 
and pointed missile bras as well as garter belts and gstrings

prime minister brian mulroney says canadas 
provincial ministers have agreed to continue closeddoor discussions 
to try to settle a constitutional rift that has prompted talk of 
quebecs secession 
an informal dinner meeting sunday night in hull quebec across 
the ottawa river from the national parliament was called in hopes 
of moving toward a fullscale conference 
mulroney emerged from the fivehour meeting to say we still 
havent finished our work and that provinical leaders would 
reconvene this morning in ottawa 
the provincial leaders are discussing the meech lake agreement a 
proposed amendment designed to convince quebec to sign canadas 1982 
national constitution 
quebec refused to sign the document saying that the 
frenchspeaking provinces distinct nature had not been taken into 
consideration 
i remain optimistic said quebec premier robert bourassa 
it seemed there was a will to break the impasse all the premiers 
realized the seriousness of the situation 
in 1987 the 10 provincial premiers and mulroney signed the 
fivepoint meech lake accord named for the site of the signing at 
a lake near ottawa as a way to protect quebecs culture and 
language they set a deadline of june 23 1990 to win ratification 
by all 10 provincial legislatures 
since then however governments in three provinces have changed 
and the new premiers have refused to go along with the agreement 
throwing the country into crisis and leading to talk about quebec 
secession and even a breakup of canada 
the most controversial of the five points in the accord is the 
one designating quebec as a distinct society the other four 
points concern methods of amending the constitution the power of 
provinces to opt out of some federalprovincial spending programs 
nominations to the supreme court and senate reform 
bourassa insisted that the meech lake accord must be ratified 
as is quebecs concessions were made in 1987 he said and its 
not realistic to presume that i can go before the national assembly 
to ratify an amended meech lake 
nationalism has been on the rise in recent months in quebec 
where many feel they are being rejected by english canada

rival democrats harvey gantt and mike 
easley entering the closing hours of their senate runoff primary 
are concentrating their fire on republican sen jesse helms but 
across the continent california democrats are slamming each other 
north carolina and california are among nine states holding 
primaries on tuesday the busiest day so far of the 1990 election 
year the other states are alabama iowa mississippi montana new 
jersey new mexico and south dakota 
as they entered the final 24 hours before voters cast their 
ballots candidates checked opinion polls unleashed their final 
television ads and tried to stir support with a closing round of 
personal appearances

race for the democratic nomination for governor of california showed 
former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein maintaining a lead over 
state attorney general john van de kamp 
the los angeles times poll said feinstein had a 13point lead a 
gain of two points over a similar survey early in may the poll gave 
the former mayor 42 percent and van de kamp 29 percent there were 
29 percent still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor 
candidates on the democratic primary ballot 
mervin fields california poll which gave feinstein a slim 3 
percent lead earlier this month reported that margin had opened up 
to 8 points over van de kamp 4234 in polling that concluded 
sunday new polls also were out in iowa and new mexico 
in north carolina easley accused helms of attacking him with 
personal character assassinations in radio ads they are 
personal and very negative the brunswick county prosecutor told 
supporters sunday 
one helms ad accuses easley of waffling on the issues and another 
suggests that he pleabargained a drug case involving a campaign 
contributors son who was caught with nearly a pound of cocaine 
easley said he was countering with ads saying this year north 
carolina must say no to jesse helms and mudslinging 
i think charlotte people believed long before anyone else that 
we are going to bring jesse helms home gantt told supporters 
sunday night in charlotte nc 
abortion was the issue of the day in california where sen pete 
wilson had only token opposition for the gop nomination to succeed 
fellow republican george deukmejian in the governors office 
deukmejian declined to seek a third term 
van de kamp appeared on the steps of the los angeles county 
courthouse with norma mccorvey the jane roe of the landmark 
us supreme courts roe vs wade abortion rights decision 
i have no criticism of mrs feinsteins record on abortion 
mccorvey said but i believe john van de kamp is the candidate who 
will do the most to protect a womans right to choose i trust john 
van de kamp 
feinstein also stressed her long support of abortion rights 
telling fundraisers in west hollywood that i believe that a woman 
is best protected by another woman who believes in the right to 
choose 
the two candidates were running television commercials harshly 
attacking each other 
van de kamps commercials described feinstein as a republican 
in democratic clothing while the former mayors ads accused the 
attorney general of refusing to talk about his own record 
abortion also has been a major issue in iowas democratic primary 
for governor the national abortion rights action league endorsed 
iowa house speaker don avenson in a move designed to help him 
against antiabortion rival tom miller the state attorney general 
republican gov terry branstad is an abortion opponent 
a new poll published sunday in the des moines register said 
avenson had moved into the lead with support from 32 percent of 
those surveyed compared with 25 percent for miller former banker 
john chrystal was at 19 percent and 20 percent said they were 
undecided 
the newspaper said the sampling was among 629 likely primary 
voters and had a margin of error of 39 percent 
its breaking our way obviously said avenson 
in new mexico large fields were seeking the gubernatorial 
nomination in both parties incumbent gop gov garrey carruthers was 
ineligible to seek reelection but the person elected to succeed 
him will be the first new mexico governor allowed to serve two 
successive terms 
a new poll published sunday in the albuquerque journal said state 
senate minority leader les houston and former legislator frank bond 
each had the support of 292 percent of the registered republicans 
surveyed 
on the democratic side former gov bruce king had the backing of 
427 percent while state attorney general paul bardacke was 
supported by 315 percent 
the poll was conducted for the journal by research and polling 
inc of albuquerque which surveyed 664 registered democrats and 402 
registered republicans it had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 
percent for the democrats and 5 percent for the republicans 
a large field was battling in alabama for the democratic 
nomination to oppose gop gov guy hunt the first republican to hold 
that office since the postcivil war reconstruction period 
among the democratic contenders was former gov fob james who was 
taped recently by a public television crew while telling a 
republican party official that there aint but one damn goldwater 
republican in this race and you know who that is 
an aide to james a former republican said the remark was a 
joke more than anything 
in montana four republicans were vying for the nomination to 
oppose democratic sen max baucus 
in mississippi republican sen thad cochran was as good as 
reelected to a third term he had no primary opposition and no 
democrat has filed to run against him in the fall 
democratic sens bill bradley of new jersey and howell heflin of 
alabama had only token primary opposition the same was true of 
republican sens larry pressler of south dakota and pete domenici of 
new mexico 
gantt and easley worked hard to get out their core supporters 
there are a lot of voters out there especially in the east 
that we ought to be able to pick up easley said while campaigning 
in the eastern part of the state if we have a big turnout in the 
east mike easley will win the runoff if we dont itll be real 
close 
gantt sought votes in the same region over the weekend 
especially in the northeast which has a high percentage of black 
voters who were critical in the may 8 primary when the former mayor 
of charlotte led a sixman field 
but gantt fell short of the 40 percent threshold he needed to 
avoid a runoff and become the first black candidate for statewide 
office in north carolina this century

hepburn called him the quintessential actor 
actress lynn redgrave called harrison the master of high comedy 
playing

coming she said from san diego 
my fair lady a musical version of george bernard shaws 
pygmalion was revived in 1981 with harrison reprising his role 
for 50000 a week 
mr harrison is perfect in the part crisp lean complacent 
and condescending until at last a real flare of human emotions burns 
the egotism away reviewer brooks atkinson of the new york times 
wrote at the time of the premiere in 1956 
harrison who characterized his vocal range as one and a half 
notes crooned ive grown accustomed to her face hundreds of 
times as the stuffy language professor who falls in love with a 
cockney waif after teaching her to speak proper english 
i could have played higgins for 20 years but i wanted to do 
other things harrison said in 1985 and i did in fact 
among them was his role as dr dolittle the man who talked with 
the animals and taught them to speak back the 1967 film introduced 
harrison to a new generation of young moviegoers his other 
bestknow movies included major barbara in 1940 and blithe 
spirit in 1945 
he had the best sense of humor of almost any actor i have ever 
known said his agent lawrence evans who worked with harrison 
for more than 40 years he was a lovable irascible man

the supreme court agreed today to decide 
whether passengers on international flights may sue airlines for 
emotional distress allegedly suffered in nearcrashes that cause 
them no physical harm 
the court said it will review a ruling that eastern airlines may 
be forced to pay passengers on a flight that landed safely in miami 
after all the planes engines failed briefly in the air 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled last year that the 
socalled wa an international air travel treaty 
permits airlines to be sued in such cases rsaw conventionby passengers 
who suffer 
only psychological trauma 
an airline is required by the treaty to pay up to 75000 per 
person depending on the severity of injuries the liability ceiling 
is lifted only if the airline is shown to have committed willful 
misconduct 
the treaty only covers international flights in domestic 
flights the law of the state in which a lawsuit was filed would 
apply lawyers for eastern airlines said in most states passengers 
on domestic flights who can prove negligence but not willful 
misconduct would be barred from recovering damages for emotional 
distress unaccompanied by physical injury 
the 11th circuit court ruled in the case of eastern flight 855 
which left miami on may 5est in hong kong 
where about 100000 demonstrated hong kong reverts to chinese rule

the supreme court today agreed to hear a bush 
administration appeal aimed at giving federal officials more power 
to deny temporary legal status to immigrant farmworkers 
the court without comment said it will review a ruling that 
said the workers are entitled to various procedural protections when 
applying for such residential permits 
the case stems from a 1988 lawsuit by the haitian refugee center 
the migration and refugee services of the roman catholic diocese of 
palm beach fla and 17 applicants for temporary residence the 
classaction suit is intended to benefit thousands of aliens 
the suit said applicants for temporary residency were being 
denied their rights under a 1986 federal law that established a 
program for admitting foreign farmworkers to the united states 
to be eligible for the program aliens must have applied during 
an 18month period that ended nov 30 1988 and have done migrant 
farm work for at least 90 days during a oneyear period that ended 
may 1 1986 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals last year upheld a federal 
judges ruling that required the immigration and naturalization 
service ins to take a number of steps to assure applicants are 
treated fairly when interviewed for temporary residency 
thosnslators permitting applicants to present witnesses and 
requiring ins interviewers to explain what evidence they relied on 
in ruling on applications 
the appeals court said the 1986 immigration law granted aliens 
a constitutionally protected right to apply for temporary residency 
as well as a right to substantiate their claims for eligibility 
once congress chooses to create such a system of entitlements a 
property interest is created that is accorded procedural due process 
protection 
bush administration lawyers in the appeal acted on today said 
the law does not give federal judges such sweeping authority 
the 11th circuit court ruling has sanctioned the improper 
intervention of federal district courts into the daytoday business 
of administering the immigration laws the government lawyers said 
the appeal said ins has received more than 13 million 
applications under the 1986 law for temporary residency and approved 
93 percent of them but the appeal said tens of thousands of 
applications for temporary permits could be affected by the appeals 
court ruling 
the appeal added that the 11th circuit courts ruling could have 
a bearing on additional thousands of applications for permanent 
residential status under the 1986 law 
the case is mcnary vs haitian refugee center 891332

nuclear industry whistleblowers who say 
they were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their 
employers under state personal injury laws the supreme court ruled 
today 
the court unanimously said such lawsuits are not preempted by a 
federal law protecting such whistleblowers 
todays ruling carries significant effect the federal law does 
not provide awards of punitive damages often the most lucrative 
part of a successful suit under the corresponding state laws 
we conclude that a claim for intentional infliction of 
emotional distress does not fall within the preempted field of 
nuclear safety justice harry a blackmun wrote for the court 
the decision is a victory for vera english of wilmington nc 
who worked as a laboratory technician for general electric at its 
nuclear fuels manufacturing plant there for almost 12 years before 
she was fired in july 1984 
todays decision reinstates her suit after it was ordered 
dismissed by a federal appeals court 
earlier that year ms english had complained to both the federal 
nuclear regulatory commission and to her ge supervisor about what 
she considered serious violations of federal safety standards 
when no corrective action was taken she deliberately failed to 
clean up radiation contamination at her work station in an effort to 
prove that such contamination was not being detected by safety 
inspectors 
although ms englishs efforts led to corrective action she was 
disciplined and eventually fired 
ms english sued ge in 1987 her suit sought under north 
carolina law reinstatement with back pay and monetary damages for 
wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
despite being based on state law ms englishs suit was filed in 
federal court because ges headquarters are outside the state 
a federal judge threw out the statelaw suit ruling that it was 
preempted by whistleblower provisions of the federal energy 
reorganization act 
the law bars nuclear industry employers from firing or otherwise 
disciplining employees for publicly pointing out alleged safety 
problems 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals upheld the dismissal of ms 
englishs suit last year todays decision reversed that ruling 
the case is english vs ge 89152

president bushs decision to give mikhail s 
gorbachev the trade agreement he wanted will allow the soviet leader 
to continue his economic embargo of lithuania the baltic republics 
president said today 
the trade agreement was announced during the superpower summit in 
washington it ended sunday with a joint news conference and bush 
said his decision to grant moscow trade benefits had nothing to do 
with gorbachev easing pressure on the breakaway republic 
by this agreement hes allowed to prolong the blockade against 
lithuania vytautas landsbergis told the voice of america the 
us government radio station 
moscow has slapped an embargo on the republic halting food and 
fuel supplies in retaliation for lithuanias march 11 declaration 
of independence 
bush had said earlier he would not ask congress to approve new 
trade agreements with the soviet union until moscow dropped 
restrictions on emigration and ended its blockade of lithuania 
but he changed his mind after meeting with gorbachev bush said 
he would send the trade measure to the us congress if the supreme 
soviet passed a liberalized emigration law he did not mention 
lithuania 
the linkage is between the emigration and thats it bush 
said at the news conference 
the trade agreement would be a first step toward slashing tariffs 
on soviet goods sold in the united states it would also expand 
opportunities for us companies in the soviet union by reducing red 
tape and providing greater protection against copyright piracy 
the proposal is expected to get a cool reception on washingtons 
capitol hill many members of congress have said they would not 
allow the soviet union to become a mostfavorednation trading 
partner until gorbachev ended his economic squeeze on lithuania 
the mostfavorednation designation qualifies a trading partner 
for the lowest us tariffs 
the us senate passed a nonbinding resolution last month 
seeking to halt any ussoviet trade agreements while the crackdown 
on lithuania continues 
rep les aspin chairman of the house armed services committee 
told nbctv that bush faced growing unhappiness from 
conservative republicans he said they see bushs actions as too 
conciliatory toward the soviets 
the pot has been stirred up even more by pushing trade 
without obtaining concessions on lithuania and not linking the 
issues aspin said 
kazimiera prunskiene lithuanias prime minister told voa that 
gorbachev must know it is a big question yet whether congress 
will approve the trade pact 
moscow cannot be sure of ratification while the lithuanian 
question is unresolved said mrs prunskiene who has met 
separately with bush and gorbachev in past weeks 
she said bush may have taken a tougher line against the blockade 
in private talks with gorbachev and that the us president might 
not have wanted to make that approach public

prime minister yitzhak shamir today defended the 
right of soviet jews to live in the west bank and gaza strip saying 
israel as a democracy could not keep new immigrants from the 
occupied territories 
shamirs statement came after soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev threatened to limit the emigration of soviet jews to 
israel if they continued to settle on land seized from the arabs in 
the 1967 middle east war 
speaking in washington after the summit with president bush 
gorbachev said some soviets have urged the government to postpone 
issuing permits for exit unless israel stops soviet jews from 
moving to the territories 
israeli officials said however that international and internal 
pressures probably would keep gorbachev from carrying out the threat 
the occupied lands where palestinians have been in revolt 
against israeli rule for 29 months are home to 17 million 
palestinians and 70000 jewish settlers arab nations dont want 
largescale settlement of soviet jews there 
jewish emigration from the soviet union is at an alltime high 
about 35000 soviet jews have arrived in israel so far this year and 
the figure is expected to reach as high as 150000 about 1 million 
soviets are seeking permission to emigrate 
shamir told israeli manufacturers in tel aviv that his 
governments policy was to allow jews to live anywhere in the land 
of israel including the occupied gaza strip and west bank 
if the ussr of president gorbachev does not think she can 
today tell her citizens where to live it is as clear as the sun 
that we as followers of freedom and democracy cannot limit this 
category or another of settlers 
benjamin begin a leading member of shamirs rightwing likud 
bloc told israel radio that israelis must fight for the right of 
jews to live in the occupied territories 
unless they do he said jews would have to defend their right to 
live in jerusalems jewish suburbs land annexed by israel most 
western countries have not recognized that annexation 
we must persuade the international community not to place in 
doubt the right of any jew to settle anywhere in his homeland 
begin said 
although israeli officials have defended the right of soviet jews 
to settle in the territories they have also said few have chosen to 
do so a foreign ministry spokesman said only about 200 of the jews 
who have arrived this year moved to the west bank and gaza 
simha dinitz head of the quasigovernmental jewish agency which 
handles immigration said that since april 1989 285 soviet jews 
have moved to the territories 
but the hebrew daily haaretz today quoted a jewish agency 
document as saying that in the 12 months ending march 31 1300 new 
immigrants most of them soviets had moved to the jerusalem suburbs 
after gorbachevs comments on sunday israeli absorption minister 
yitzhak peretz invited the soviet leader to visit and see for 
himself that no sizable numbers of soviet refugees are settling in 
the occupied territories 
gorbachev rejected the invitation 
i will be frank the time has not yet come to go there he 
said in minneapolis late sunday 
israeli officials said gorbachevs warning that he might limit 
jewish emigration may undermine his image and credibility in the 
west 
the policy of free emigration including jewish emigration 
conforms with the soviet unions policy to end the cold war said 
dan naveh adviser to foreign minister moshe arens 
its therefore hard to imagine that gorbachev meant to 
reconsider the policy of free immigration and by that harm the trust 
and appreciation that he has earned in this field in the free 
world naveh said 
deputy prime minister david levy said the soviet union is 
changing direction and it cannot be that only regarding jews it 
would take a step that leads it backward and not forward to 
progress and freedom 
in the united states the national conference on soviet jewry 
which lobbies for soviet immigration strongly rejected gorbachevs 
warning as a violation of fundamental human rights 
a soviet move curbing emigration could put gorbachev on a 
collision course with the united states and jeopardize a trade pact 
signed at the ussoviet summit bush said the trade agreement 
would not go to congress for its required approval without 
liberalized soviet emigration laws

serious works looking for the soul enrichment that theyre not 
getting in other mediums 
morrows optimism was reflected on the crowded convention floor 
preregistration for the convention which runs through tuesday 
was a record 24000 that was a 47 percent increase for booksellers

the supreme court today made it easier for 
lawyers to advertise themselves as specialists in some areas of the 
law 
by a 54 vote the justices said illinois officials improperly 
censured an attorney who said on his professional letterhead he is a 
civil trial specialist certified by the national board of trial 
advocacy nbta a private organization 
justice john paul stevens in the courts main opinion said 
states may not ban potentially misleading information if the 
information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive 
he was joined by justices william j brennan harry a blackmun 
and anthony m kennedy 
justice thurgood marshall provided the fifth vote to overturn the 
censure of gary e peel of edwardsville ill 
but marshall said states could take steps short of an outright 
ban to assure that lawyer advertising is not misleading 
marshall said peel could be required for example to say on his 
letterhead that the nbta is a private group 
dissenting were chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
sandra day oconnor byron r white and antonin scalia 
the illinois supreme court which disciplines that states 
lawyers had upheld a state rule against advertising oneself as a 
certified civil trial specialist 
the state court censured peel who since 1983 included the 
specialist reference on his letterhead 
the state court said peels use of the reference is misleading 
because it makes it appear he is more qualified than other lawyers 
who do the same type of work 
stevens said today the facts stated on peels letterhead are 
true and verifiable we are satisfied that the consuming public 
understands that a host of certificates are issued by 
private organizations it seems unlikely that peels statement 
about his certification as a specialist by an identified national 
organization necessarily would be confused with formal state 
recognition 
in illinois only lawyers who specialize in patent trademark and 
admiralty law have been allowed to advertise their specialities 
the illinois supreme court said the reason for allowing those 
exceptions was to help the public find attorneys who practice those 
unusual specialities 
the nbta based in boston said it uses rigorous standards to 
determine whether any civil or criminal trial advocate is entitled 
to its certification 
it said it has certified more than 1000 lawyers nationwide 
the supreme court in 1977 struck down a ban on all lawyer 
advertising ruling that it violated freespeech rights since then 
the court has upheld some regulation of lawyer ads but struck down 
other rules 
the case is peel vs attorney registration and disciplinary 
commission of illinois 881775

justice delayed is not always justice 
denied the vermont supreme court said today as it upheld a 
sixmonth moratorium on civil jury trials in the state 
the moratorium was imposed by the court in january as a way to 
cope with budget cuts prompted by the states sagging economy in 
todays decision the states highest court said constitutional 
guarantees to speedy trials do not mean instant ones 
in its ruling the court noted that the moratorium is temporary 
and it provides for exceptions where justice requires 
the supreme court imposed the ban after it was ordered to cut 
about 300000 from its current year budget to help avert a state 
deficit 
the ban affected only civil cases such things as divorces 
property disputes personal injury claims malpractice suits and 
breaches of contract it did not affect criminal matters and will 
expire july 1 
the 220member vermont trial lawyers association filed a 
classaction lawsuit on behalf of 18 vermonters seeking to overturn 
the ban the associations suit claimed that both the federal and 
state constitutions guarantee vermonters the right to a speedy trial 
it violates the constitutional rights of everyone who has asked 
for a civil jury trial in the state of vermont association 
president jerome oneill said you cant simply decide that youre 
not going to provide civil jury trials 
but the supreme court decision written by retired chief justice 
albert barney said that caseloads cannot be managed on the 
simplistic position that everyone is entitled to an immediate trial 
whenever they are ready for one 
the vermont supreme court decision is counter to a federal court 
ruling in california that held that civil jury trials in us 
district court could not be suspended because of fiscal restraints 
but the vermont justices said the federal ruling centered around 
the length of the moratorium not the moratorium itself and that 
vermont moratorium delayed civil jury trials for a relatively 
short period of time 
the moratorium on civil jury trials should save about 75000

the april 17 high court ruling in an oregon case said members of 
the native american church have no constitutional right to take the 
hallucinogenic drug peyote during religious ceremonies 
religious leaders said they were more disturbed by the courts 
method of deciding the case than by the decisions bottom line 
five members of 63 court majority agreed that religious beliefs 
cannot excuse failure to comply with otherwise valid laws 
prohibiting conduct states are free to regulate 
the april decision did not require states to have a compelling 
reason before forcing someone to comply with laws interfering with 
religious beliefs 
the case is employment division vs smith 881213

the attack came after the mainly roman catholic ira fighting to

in london police investigating irish republican army attacks 
detained several people under the prevention of terrorism act 
scotland yard reported they can be held for a week without charge 
gunmen today killed 60yearold patrick boyle when they burst 
into his home near portadown in county armagh 25 miles southwest of 
belfast police said 
one of the sons was severely wounded in the stomach and was in a 
serious condition police said the two or three attackers escaped 
in a stolen van that was found abandoned about a mile from the 
family home 
police said none of the boyle family was a member of the security 
forces and they knew of no motive for the attack 
the social democratic and liberal party the main catholic party 
in northern ireland blamed the attack on protestant extremists 
there is absolutely no reason why this family should have been

the supreme court today rejected a racialbias 
challenge to virginias practice of appointing not electing county 
and city school board members 
the justices without comment let stand rulings that upheld the 
appointive system even though unlawfully discriminatory motives at 
times played a role in retaining it 
seven black virginia residents and two groups citizens for a 
better america and the virginia unit of the southern christian 
leadership conference sued state authorities over the appointive 
system 
the lawsuit alleged that the system unlawfully blunts the 
political clout of blacks in the state 
how the members of virginias local school boards are appointed 
varies but the statemandated appointive system dates back to 1870 
us district judge richard l williams in richmond found no 
racially biased motive in the initial adoption of the system but he 
said racial discrimination figured prominently in the states 
decision at a 190102 constitutional convention to retain the system 
the state general assembly in 1947 passed a law permitting the 
election of school board members in some counties and voters in 
arlington county did so 
but when the arlington county school board voted in 1956 to 
racially desegregate its school system the general assembly 
repealed the 1947 law 
judge williams found that the legislatures action was an 
effort to impede arlingtons ability to comply with courtordered 
desegregation 
but the judge upheld last nov 24 by the 4th us circuit court 
of appeals ruled that the appointive systems challengers had 
failed to prove that racially biased motives survive today 
the appeals court ruled that state officials have proved that 
racial discrimination no longer motivates virginias decision to 
retain an appointive system for selecting school board members 
the appeals court said that while statistics indicate some 
adverse impact on black representation the challengers had failed 
to prove some discriminatory intent as well 
the defendants have proved that the state does not currently 
maintain the system for discriminatory reasons the 4th 
circuit court said 
the number of blacks serving on school boards across the state 
matches their percentage of the states population about 18 
percent 
but in the appeal acted on today the justices were told that 
blacks are underrepresented by at least one school board seat in 26 
counties and four cities 
blacks are underrepresented on school boards in 20 of the states 
40 school districts where they comprise more than 30 percent of the 
population the court was told 
there are no black members on 50 of the 136 local school boards 
there is continuing overt racial discrimination in the 
appointment of school boards the appeal contended 
the seven individuals who sued are darius irby and john s neal 
of nottoway county charles w white of buckingham county the rev 
james s wiliams jr of prince edward county cora tucker of halifax 
county willie powell and milton richardson in petersburg

more than one million mourners gathered today 
around the golddomed tomb of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini to mark 
the first anniversary of his death some beating their chests in a 
frenzy of grief 
death to america blared loudspeakers around the compound 
death to israel 
inside the packed shrine mourners listened as speakers recited 
verses from the koran the islamic holy book the graybearded 
khomeini seemed to stare sternly at the crowd from pictures hung on 
the pillars 
while there is islam we will not forget the imam read one 
banner khomeini was considered the imam or supreme spiritual leader 
some including a group of pakistanis beat their chests in a 
traditional shiite moslem sign of mourning as others sat under 
makeshift tents 
one group of old men in white shrouds with redandgreen 
headbands many of them toothless also beat their breasts and 
chanted islamic slogans 
helicopters carried officials to the shrine 
the event which climaxed a fourday mourning period gathered no 
more than 3 million people around the shrine on the outskirts of 
tehran according to foreign reporters who flew over the scene by 
helicopter 
irans official news media however said the occasion drew 8 
million to 9 million people 
a few of those arriving had official invitation cards some 
wounded veterans of the iraniraq war in wheelchairs pushed by 
revolutionary guards wearing black armbands 
maryam a woman in her early 30s lamented that i really loved 
the imam he was the true and only leader of this revolution 
khomeini died at 1045 pm on june 3 last year 
when his death was officially announced the next day millions 
poured into the streets pounding themselves scratching their faces 
and beating their breasts in grief 
in a replay of those frenetic scenes mourners thronged to his 
tomb in the beheshtezahra cemetery on the outskirts of tehran on 
the anniversary 
hundreds of people most of them conscripts or other civil 
servants who had been ordered to attend todays ceremonies walked 
for days to arrive at the tomb a young soldier who displayed the 
blisters on his feet from three days of walking said only that i 
came last year and i had to come again this year 
two hundred thousand mourners were brought to tehran from 
villages towns and other cities in thousands of buses the 
commander of the highway police told iranian news media 
hundreds of shiite moslems from other countries such as pakistan 
bangladesh india syria and lebanon were invited to attend 
elsewhere hundreds gathered inside the mosque adjoining 
khomeinis old house in the northern tehran suburb of jamaran on 
sunday sobbing and beating themselves as they looked at the small 
empty balcony from which khomeini used to address the nation 
only a year after khomeinis death many of his followers who 
actively participated in the 1979 revolution that ousted shah 
mohammad reza pahlavi have become disillusioned but many iranians 
contend that although the revolution has soured khomeini was 
sincere in what he wanted to achieve for his people 
there are many who are disgruntled with the countrys economic 
conditions widespread official corruption and the unfulfilled 
promises of the revolution 
most of the economic woes are due to the eightyear war with iraq 
and khomeinis implacable antiwestern stance which irans present 
leaders are having a difficult time circumventing in order to get 
foreign investment and western technology 
khomeinis staunch followers like his only surviving son ahmad 
an important figure in the socalled radical camp within the 
leadership want no deviation from his teaching

the supreme court today left intact an alabama 
tax attacked as grossly discriminatory against outofstate 
businesses 
the court without comment rejected arguments that the tax 
interferes unduly with interstate commerce and violates equal 
protection rights 
the alabama supreme court while acknowledging that the tax is 
more onerous for outofstate businesses concluded that it is valid 
there is no unconstitutional unequal treatment of foreign 
corporations and no unconstitutional discrimination against them 
the state court ruled last dec 21 
the tax was challenged by general motors and its subsidiaries and 
by reynolds metals co which is based in richmond va and is a 
producer of aluminum 
alabama imposes a franchise tax on all business conducted in the 
state companies based outside the state pay a tax of 3 for every 
1000 worth of capital in the state instate companies pay 10 for 
every 1000 worth of all outstanding stock 
lawyers for gm and reynolds metals told the justices that the two 
methods of calculating the tax result in enormously higher taxes for 
outofstate businesses 
the reason is that while the amount of business activity 
conducted and total capital employed in alabama means everything in 
determining the foreign corporations tax liability gms appeal 
said business activity and total capital employed mean nothing in 
determining the domestic corporations liability 
for 1982 and 1983 alabama collected 94 million in franchise 
taxes from outofstate businesses based on 28792 tax returns and 
less than 10 million from instate businesses based on 81698 
returns 
adjustments to the tax law took effect in 1984 but that year 
outofstate businesses paid 496 million in franchise taxes and 
instate businesses paid 147 million 
reynolds metals paid about 12 million in franchise taxes for 
1982 and 1983 the years for which it sued for refunds 
gm sued over the years 1983 through 1988 in which it paid 63 
million in alabama franchise taxes 
the two appeals acted on today were supported by the state tax 
council of the state chambers of commerce and an organization called 
the tax executives institute 
the broad implication of the state courts holding is that 
discrimination against outofstate taxpayers will be 
tolerated lawyers for the chamber of commerces council said 
if interstate business is to be protected from discriminatory 
state taxes the decision of the alabama supreme court must be 
reviewed 
the cases are gm vs alabama department of revenue 891574 and 
reynolds metals vs sizemore 891587

here are excerpts from the speech of soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev to a group of us business 
executives on sunday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
a few hours ago president bush and i together at our press 
conference summed up the results of the washington summit i 
personally believe that this summit will go down in history as a 
summit of hope and optimism 
it took us some time a long time and a long road to reach this 
stage in our relationship i dont know sometimes when we express 
big hopes we have to knock on wood anyway let me say that we do 
have high hopes we hope that there will be very important political 
and politicalmilitary consequences of this summit and also very 
positive consequences in all other spheres of relations between our 
countries 
the important question is what kind of soviet union do the 
president and the us people want to see does america want to see 
a soviet union that lacks confidence that is not stable that is in 
turmoil or does america want to see the soviet union as a noble 
democratic state which is moving toward new forms of life within the 
overall framework of humanism and democracy a soviet union that is 
working with the entire global civilization integrated in that 
civilization 
so this is the alternative and basically the same alternative 
confronts us that is to say what kind of us do we want to see i 
have thought about that for a long time 
a world that is not comfortable for the us is not comfortable 
for us 
the president and i spent several hours together the two of us 
during this visit our final discussions were in camp david without 
neckties our sleeves rolled up and we discussed things in a very 
intensive way and i feel that as a result we have a new degree of 
confidence and mutual understanding 
now my second point is about the process of change in our 
economy about perestroika in our economy i would like to be brief 
many of you i think must have visited moscow or i dont know 
maybe quite a few have not 
i listened and talked to members of the economic council in 
moscow and i tried to tell them what we intend to do with our 
economy and how we plan to do it the last five years is a period 
that has not been simple for us 
we had to sort things out to understand what kind of a society we 
have what are the good things that we are able to do and what are 
the misjudgments that we have to abandon we were trying to do that 
in a very thorough way and also in a very tough way toward 
ourselves in a selfcritical way toward ourselves 
and in addition to studying ourselves we were trying also to 
test certain new elements and new forms of economic management 
we tried quite a few things in order to gain experience and tried to 
place our management people and production units into a new 
situation new conditions new circumstances and we have seen that 
the whole process moved ahead with great difficulty 
why because of that command system that we have the command 
system in politics and in the economy our economic managers many 
of them very good people who know how to work were used to a system 
of commands to a system of taking orders from above and that 
really happened for many many years many decades 
and a certain type of individual a certain type of economic 
manager evolved and it is very difficult to abandon those old ways 
particularly for people who are not that young 
but in the same way the command system worked as regards those 
who actually worked the machines who actually drive the tractors 
who work in the research labs all of them too basically are that 
type of individual they of course wanted freedom and economic 
autonomy but once they got that they were afraid 
they didnt know how to use that much freedom so this gives you 
an idea of the scope of the problems and this is how we began 
changing a system means changing people intelligent people its 
not just a system some kind of layout that you see on a piece of 
paper and you can just tear up that piece of paper a system is 
people people who live people who have their own interests who 
have their own lives and we have this conflict of interest and 
really had a problem trying to move these new economic forms ahead 
and we were only able to approach that when we began a political 
reform that involved the masses of the people in the political 
process 
if the economic reform is successful then people will not need 
rallies demonstrations and so on although of course quite a few 
rallies and demonstrations i think are going to happen before we are 
successful in economic reform 
we have made mistakes this is true there has been some damage 
done to our economy we have had some problems in management because 
the old system of running the economy has become weaker and the new 
economic leaders the new economic forms of a market economy have 
not yet evolved properly 
the entire structure of a market economy is only beginning to 
evolve so therefore we need to adopt a number of other laws and 
documents that will make it possible for our economy to really work 
among market principles so i think that we are now at this 
watershed when we are ready to move resolutely toward the market 
this is what we are doing now this is i think what will be decisive 
for the entire perestroika the future of perestroika 
we are having now a very crucial situation in which we would like 
to hope for your cooperation and for your understanding 
those who are with us at this time have a good prospect of 
cooperation in our great country in our great market because of its 
tremendous potential but those who just stand on the sidelines who 
do not want to risk who want to wait and see who dont want to 
risk their dollars well they will remain i think observers for 
years to come 
well make sure that that is so

student prayer groups must be allowed to meet 
at public schools that permit other organized extracurricular 
activities the supreme court ruled today 
the justices voting 81 said a 1984 federal law aimed at 
permitting religious clubs in public schools does not violate 
constitutionally required separation of church and state 
the court overruled omaha neb school officials who refused to 
approve a high school biblereading club 
justice sandra day oconnor writing for the court said the 
equal access act of 1984 passes the courts longstanding threepart 
test aimed at assuring separation of church and state 
the law grants equal access to both secular and religious speech 
does not have the primary effect of advancing religion and does not 
cause excessive entanglement between government and religion she 
said 
in other action the court 
ruled that police undercover agents may seek to elicit 
confessions froms jailed criminal suspects without first having to 
give socalled miranda warnings 
by an 81 vote the justices said jailed criminal suspects need 
not be told about their right to remain silent or to get a lawyers 
help before4 being questioned by someone secretly working for the 
police 
used a dispute over haitian refugee rights to strengthen a 
federal law requiring the government to pay legal fees to winning 
opponents in lawsuits 
the court unanimously rejected bush administration arguments 
aimed at limiting the attorneys fees 
ruled that nuclear industry whistleblowers who say they 
were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their 
employers under state personal injury laws 
the court unanimously said such lawsuits are not preempted by a 
federal law protecting such whistleblowers 
agreed to hear a bush administration appeal aimed at giving 
federal officials more power to deny temporary legal status to 
immigrant farmworkers 
the court without comment said it will review a ruling that 
said the workers are entitled to various procedural protections when 
applying for such residential permits 
agreed to study the governments power to lift price controls 
on some natural gas a case that has tens of millions of dollars at 
stake for consumers 
the justices said they will review federal regulations that 
among other things allow gas producers to raise some prices charged 
to pipeline companies 
agreed to decide whether passengers on international flights 
may sue airlines for the emotional distress they allegedly suffer in 
nearcrashes that cause them no physical harm 
the court said it will review a ruling that eastern airlines may 
be forced to pay passeng4ers who were on a flight that landed safely 
in miami after all the planes engines failed briefly in the air 
in the schoolprayer case oconnor said there is little risk 
that students will view an extracurricular biblereading club as 
indicating school officials endorse religion 
the possibility of student peer pressure remains she said 
but there is little if any risk of official state endorsement or 
coercion where no formal classroom activities are involved and no 
school officials actively participate 
congress in the equal access act said public high schools 
accepting federal aid must not discriminate against groups based on 
the religious political philosphical or other content of the 
speech at such meetings 
the law requires access to school facilities for religious clubs 
if other noncurriculumrelated student groups are allowed to 
meet 
at westside high school in omaha officials authorized some 30 
such activities including chess scuba diving and photography clubs 
the officials said the clubs are related to classroom work or 
other aspects of the school curriculum for example they said chess 
helps students learn mathematics and logic and scuba diving is tied 
to the schools physical fitness program 
the officials said the 1984 act therefore should not apply to 
them but they also argued that if the law does apply it should be 
declared unconstitutional as a governmentsponsored establishment of 
religion 
some groups who supported the school officials such as the 
national school boards assocation said the 1984 law is a thinly 
disguised move to return prayer to the public schools the supreme 
court in 1962 banned organized schoolsponsored prayer sessions for 
students 
the bush administration defended the 1984 law as a legitimate 
attempt to protect religious liberty for students 
students at westside high sought recognition in 1985 of a 
christian bible study club to meet after school hours on school 
grounds officials refused to approve it and suggested the students 
meet instead at a church next door 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals in 1989 overruled a federal 
judge and said the club must be allowed to meet on school premises 
the supreme court in 1981 said staterun universities cannot ban 
student groups from using campus facilities for religious worship 
and study but before today the justices had not decided whether 
the same rule should apply to public high schools 
today justices thurgood marshall and william j brennan 
concurred in the outcome of the westside high school case but 
expressed some serious reservations 
marshall in an opinion joined by brennan said schools such as 
westside must be careful to effectively disassociate themselves 
from the religious speech that now may become commonplace in their 
facilities 
justice john paul stevens dissented he said todays ruling could 
force schools to open their doors to every religious political or 
social organization no matter how controversial or distasteful its 
views may be 
the case is board of education vs mergens 881597

the supreme court today asked the bush 
administration to offer its opinions about key limitations on free 
agency in the national football league 
the court asked justice department lawyers to comment on a lower 
courts ruling that nfl restrictions on a players switch to another 
team do not violate federal antitrust law 
the justices are not expected to say whether they will review 
that ruling until hearing from the government lawyers which could 
take months 
no further court action in the case is likely before october 
when the justices return from their summer recess scheduled for 
late june or early july 
the antitrust case is an outgrowth of a 24day strike in 1987 by 
the national football league players association the walkout ended 
without a new contract between the players and the leagues 28 team 
owners 
but the owners continued to enforce an expired contract signed 
in 1982 containing provisions that restrict free agency 
the provisions limit a players ability to negotiate and sign 
with a new team the players original team is given the right to 
match a competing clubs offer 
if the original team declines to match the offer the players 
new team must compensate the other team with draft choices 
the provisions are called the leagues first refusalcompensation 
system the nfl has a separate provision known as plan b in which 
teams protect 37 players and permit the rest to become free agents 
the players association filed a federal lawsuit in 1987 accusing 
the league and team owners of violating antitrust law by enforcing 
the first refusalcompensation system after the expiration of the 
1982 contract 
the owners said they are exempt from antitrust law arguing that 
the old collective bargaining agreement still is valid they said 
the players union is trying to win in court what it was unable to 
win at the bargaining table 
us district judge david doty of minneapolis in 1988 ruled in 
favor of the players ordering a trial to determine whether the 
owners were guilty of antitrust violations 
but the 8th us circuit court of appeals overturned dotys 
decision last november 
in a 21 ruling the appeals court said the league and owners 
were exempt from antitrust law because of the previously negoiated 
union contract 
the players choice now is between further negotiations or a 
strike the appeals court said permitting them to sue under such 
circumstances would upset the level playing field created by 
federal labor law it added 
in a dissenting opinion judge gerald w heaney said the appeals 
court ruling permits the owners to violate the antitrust law 
indefinitely 
the 8th circuit courts decision was hailed by the owners as a 
major victory that would spur the players to return to the 
bargaining table 
the players association responded by decertifying itself as the 
players bargaining agent a move designed to nullify the 1982 
contract and revive the antitrust suit 
nine current and former union officials substituted themselves 
for the association in filing the appeal acted on today 
they said the 8th circuit court ruling amounts to a virtually 
unlimited antitrust exemption for employers in unionized 
industries 
eight states supported the appeal saying their efforts to 
curtail anticompetitive behavior could be hampered by the appeals 
court ruling the states are new york arizona hawaii louisiana 
michigan texas utah and wyoming 
the case is powell vs nfl 891421

the supreme court today used a dispute over 
haitian refugee rights to strengthen a federal law requiring the 
government to pay legal fees to winning opponents in lawsuits 
the court unanimously rejected bush administration arguments 
aimed at limiting the attorneys fees 
the justices said the government generally must reimburse winning 
opponents not only for the legal fees they incur in the main 
lawsuit but also for subsequent litigation over the size of those 
fees 
the haitian refugees sued the government in 1981 over its policy 
of locking up aliens caught while trying to enter the united states 
illegally 
until 1981 the government generally allowed the aliens to go 
free on parole pending hearings on their applications for admission 
to the country 
the haitians said they almost never were paroled before their 
applications were acted upon a process that can take longer than a 
year 
the refugees accused the government of discriminating against 
them because they are black and also said the immigration and 
naturalization service violated federal rules by summarily adopting 
harsher treatment for haitians than other aliens 
the refugees ultimately won an important though not total 
victory 
the did not win on the discrimination claim but the government 
conceded that the ins may not consider race or national origin in 
determining parole and adopted new rules on refugees 
federal courts that reviewed the case said there is no doubt that 
the haitians won their freedom because of the lawsuit and those 
refugees later returned to custody were detained under new fairer 
rules 
the government argued that the haitians did not win key elements 
of their lawsuit and should not be entitled to recover legal fees 
under the equal access to justice act 
the act generally requires reimbursement of legal fees for those 
who prevail in suits against the government 
a federal judge ruled against the government on the fees question 
in the haitian case and awarded more than 1 million to lawyers who 
represented the refugees 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals substantially upheld the 
judges decision and ordered further hearings to recompute the 
amount owed the lawyers 
the appeals court also said the government must reimburse the 
haitians lawyers for fees they incurred litigating the fees issue 
what the appeals court called the feesforfees issue 
the supreme court today agreed rejecting the governments 
argument that the feesforfees claim should be denied because 
the governments position in the fee litigation was substantially 
justified 
justice john paul stevens writing for the court said that since 
the government lost the principle part of the case it is not 
entitled to relitigate the fees issue 
the case is commissioner of ins vs jean 89601

rebels today captured a key army 
checkpoint near the international airport outside monrovia an 
airline official said and president samuel doe appealed for us 
help as the rebels advanced on the city 
more than 50 us embassy workers missionaries and their 
families and hundreds of liberians crowded another airport inside 
the capital amid fears there would be a bloodbath if the rebels took 
the city 
british airways manager david ranger said rebels seized the army 
checkpoint seven miles east of the international airport which is 
35 miles southeast of the capital 
ranger said his airline canceled its flights to the west african 
nation for the rest of the week but other airlines still planned to 
fly 
four warships of the us navys 6th fleet carrying 2000 
marines were expected to arrive off the coast today or tuesday in 
case an emergency evacuation of the estimated 2000 remaining 
americans becomes necessary 
doe called on all peaceloving nations including the united 
states to come to the aid of the liberian people 
it is the wishes of the people of this country that america can 
do something to stop the bloodshed he said in a telephone 
interview from liberia with cable news network 
the us state department has accused rebel leader charles taylor 
of receiving some support from libya but it also has said marines 
will not intervene in support of does government 
he has ordered his troops into their barracks because of charges 
they were assaulting and killing members of tribal groups who have 
supported the rebels no defense lines were visible in the capital 
or on the road to the airport 
does military commander lt gen henry dubar appeared to be 
counting on the marines to step in and save the capital 
the armed forces of liberia would not consider a marine landing 
an invasion he said we are very happy about them coming it is 
long overdue the rebels are libyanbacked so we felt the united 
states should come to our aid immediately just the presence of the 
marines here will scare the rebels away 
the rebels are mostly members of the gio and mano tribes and 
invaded the country of 25 million people from the neighboring ivory 
coast about five months ago 
the state department last week ordered all nonessential us 
government personnel and their families to leave immediately about 
75 americans remained at the embassy said spokesman david krekke 
at spriggs payne airfield about five miles from the city center 
about 50 americans 20 south koreans and a few british and canadians 
left aboard a chartered boeing 737 to freetown capital of sierra 
leone 
in the city people of the mandingo and krahn tribes loyal to doe 
piled their belongings into taxis trucks and buses fleeing 
reprisals by rebels threatening to attack the capital 
if they come theyll massacre us so were going said a 
father of four children as he stacked a mattress onto the back of a 
truck he and two other mandingo families were heading for sierra 
leone taxi drivers said the exodus had caused a traffic jam at the 
border 
many of the hundreds of fleeing liberians were families of 
soldiers trying to get on two planes that have been used for the 
past week to ferry people of president does krahn tribe to their 
eastern grand gedeh county stronghold grand gedeh has not been 
affected by the civil war 
doe has been holed up in his presidential mansion in the capital 
he is protected by about 1000 israelitrained troops 
diplomats say a high desertion rate has helped shrink the 
liberian army which was believed to number 4500 at the beginning 
of the conflict to roughly 3000 to 4000 fighters about as many 
as the rebels 
rebels have killed krahn and mandingo civilians in retaliation 
for government troop atrocities against gio and mano civilians 
international human rights organizations say the soldiers have 
killed hundreds of civilians and the rebels scores 
about 2000 gios and manos overflowed the compound of st peters 
lutheran church in monrovia today where they have been put under 
the protection of the international committee of the red cross 
dozens of cars lined up for gasoline in the capital sunday there 
were fistfights at some gas stations taxi drivers said there were 
reports that a gas shortage would worsen because no new supplies 
were expected before the end of the week 
the government tried to end the panic in a state radio broadcast 
reassuring residents that plenty of gasoline was available 
doe who seized power in 1979 in a bloody coup announced on 
friday that he would not run in scheduled 1991 elections the 
announcement was an apparent bid to bring the rebels to the 
negotiating table 
both doe and rebel leader taylor refuse to negotiate directly 
it is turning into a personal conflict between doe and taylor 
at the expense of a tribal bloodbath said an expatriate who has 
worked in liberia for 20 years 
taylor was a close aide of doe who headed the government agency 
responsible for disbursing public funds he fled the country after 
the liberian leader accused him of stealing 1 million from state 
coffers 
taylor has denied the charges but doe says he will not negotiate 
with a criminal 
descendants of freed us slaves founded liberia in 1822 and it 
became africas first independent country in 1847

lawyers may withhold their state bar 
association dues if the association uses the money to campaign for 
political or social causes a unanimous supreme court ruled today 
the court said a california bar group violated the freespeech 
rights of 21 lawyers who did not want their dues spent to promote 
such causes as a nuclear weapons freeze and handgun control 
compulsory dues may not be expended to endorse or advance a gun 
control or nuclear weapons freeze ballot initiative chief 
justice william h rehnquist wrote for the court 
conversely he said the freespeech rights of lawyers are not 
violated when their dues are used to help discipline members of the 
bar or to propose ethical codes for the profession 
the justices overturned a california supreme court ruling last 
year that said the bar association was free to use the money for 
practically anything but financing campaigns of candidates for 
public office 
the california court said the bar association with power to help 
license and discipline lawyers is more like a state agency than a 
labor union 
the us supreme court previously has limited the power of unions 
to spend dues money for publicissue lobbying 
today rehnquist said the bar association is more like a union 
than a typical government agency noting the lawyers group is 
funded not by the taxpayers but by members dues 
also he said the bar association was formed primarily as an 
advisory organization lawyers are licensed or disciplined by the 
state supreme court with advice from the association 
the ruling buttresses decisions by courts outside of california 
that have limited the power of state bar associations to use 
members dues for ideological purposes

gov michael s dukakis says the 
states fiscal woes and his defeat in the 1988 presidential election 
have not quelled his optimism about the future 
the shift toward democracy in eastern europe augured a promising 
era for the nations newest graduates dukakis said in a 
commencement speech sunday at williams college 
for someone who graduated from college in the 50s when joe 
mccarthy was terrorizing the nation and joe stalin was terrorizing 
the world i think the graduates of the class of 1990 are entering 
an era in world history more promising more hopeful and more likely 
to reflect democratic values than at any time in this century he 
said 
that may sound a bit puzzling coming from someone who suffered 
a very disappointing loss in the last presidential campaign and 
returned to a state that has had serious fiscal difficulties for the 
past year and a half he said 
however dukakis sounded a warning about the health of democracy 
in the united states 
voters in czechoslovakia stood in line for hours to cast their 
ballots and exercise their newfound democratic rights he said but 
in the united states voter turnouerturned a california supreme court ruling 
last 
year that said the bar association was free to use the money for

secretary of state james a baker iii is flying 
to copenhagen today to take up a ninepoint western plan for 
resolving an impasse over the military future of germany with soviet 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
baker also will meet in the danish capital with west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher the separate sessions will 
be held on tuesday amid a 35nation conference on human rights 
among the ideas baker will pursue is a possible political 
agreement between nato and the sovietled warsaw pact as one way 
of reassuring moscow should it drop its objections to a unified 
germany joining the western military alliance baker said sunday 
other approaches also under discussion include a strengthening of 
the 35nation european security conference which the soviets have 
demanded and a timetable for negotiations on tactical nuclear 
missiles us officials said 
additionally baker will assure the soviets that nato troops 
would not be stationed on what is now east german territory while 
the red army could remain for some time the officials told the 
associated press on condition of anonymity 
baker and the 15 other nato foreign ministers including 
genscher will take up the difficult german problem again on 
thursday at a meeting of the north atlantic council in turnberry 
scotland 
the human rights conference and the meeting of the western allies 
were already on the agenda before president bush and soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev met for their fourday summit which 
ended sunday in washington 
but the bushgorbachev dispute over germanys military future 
gave bakers trip extra significance baker plans to meet with 
shevardnadze again in berlin later in the month 
gorbachev wound up his talks with bush saying the two superpowers 
would work toward a mutually acceptable solution 
baker said there are some ideas one of them he said might 
be a political agreement of some sort between the two alliances 
the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
baker on nbctvs meet the press said the proposals under 
study came from the united states the soviet union and the nato 
allies among them were some previously aired a more political 
rather than military spin on german membership in nato and 
genschers proposal to keep nato troops out of the territory that is 
now east germany 
well keep wrestling with it baker said 
gorbachev for his part declared sunday that i cannot say that 
we have reached agreement but that does not mean that our efforts 
were futile many new arguments emerged as a result of these 
discussions and new possible perspectives 
we will continue our discussion in order to find a mutually 
acceptable solution gorbachev said 
gorbachev has repeatedly insisted that a unified germany not be 
aligned with nato he argues that in an era of democratic change 
his own people see the alliance as an antisoviet remnant of the 
cold war and having lost 27 million lives to nazi germany in world 
war ii would be offended by the membership of a new more powerful 
germany in that organization 
bush at a joint news conference said that a united germany in 
nato would be stabilizing he said he did not think his 
differences with gorbachev on the issue had been narrowed during the 
summit 
us officials said last week that gorbachev had proposed 
creation of a new alleuropean council to consider military 
questions arising from the impending merger of east germany and west 
germany among them would be the size of the german army 
late sunday a senior us official said gorbachev was in full 
accord with bush that germans had the right to make a decision 
about nato membership by virtue of the 1975 helsinki agreement 
signed by 35 nations 
its the first time he has done that with the president said 
the official who sought out reporters while insisting he not be 
quoted by name or otherwise identified 
he said that he agreed that this was up to the german people to 
decide the official said well have to see what that means

security reasons during a period of 10 days around the nov 1112 
ceremony an official of the french embassy said speaking 
anonymously 
japanese drinkers normally enjoy the privilege of being the first 
to taste the beaujolais nouveau eight hours earlier than in 
france 
consumption of the new wine is usually put on sale after midnight 
on the third thursday of november because of a marketing strategy by 
the union interprofessionelle des vins du beaujolais in france 
this years wine will be available in japan on nov 22 a week 
behind the rest of the world the official said 
an official of suntory ltd a major japanese distiller and 
importer of the wine predicted that sales in japan will not be 
affected by the one weeks delay because the company has found that 
beaujolais nouveaus popularity increases year after year in 
japan 
suntory imported some 58880 cases of the 1989 beaujolais nouveau 
japanese wont make much fuss about being the first in 
tasting the wine hisao matsushita manager of foods and beverages 
for the narita view hotel near tokyos narita airport last year 
the hotel sponsored winetasting parties to mark the beginning of 
the wine season

the supreme court today strengthened the 
governments power to keep the taxes withheld from businesses about 
to declare bankruptcy 
voting 90 the justices ruled that the trustee of bankrupt 
american international airways is not entitled to recover 700000 
in taxes paid to the internal revenue service 
the airline had become delinquent by the spring of 1984 in 
withholding social security and income taxes from employee wages and 
excise taxes collected from passengers 
the irs then ordered the airline to file monthly instead of 
quarterly tax returns and open a special bank account to handle the 
tax deposits 
american international filed for bankruptcy in july 1984 to try 
to reorganize the business and pay off some of the money owed 
creditors that effort failed and three months later a trustee was 
appointed to liquidate the company 
the trustee sought to recover 16 million in taxes paid to the 
irs in the months leading up to the liquidation 
a bankruptcy judge in pennsylvania permitted the trustee to 
recover 700000 from the government and the irs appealed to the 3rd 
us circuit court of appeals based in philadelphia 
the appeals court said the trustee may not recover the 700000 
the balance collected by the irs was not at issue in that ruling or 
todays decision 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the high court said the 
700000 was not the property of american international but rather 
was being held in trust for the irs 
the case is begier vs irs 899393

a woman who wanted to start a high school 
bible study club five years ago said a us supreme court decision 
today will send a clear message to schools that they cant 
discriminate against religion 
in an 81 decision the high court ruled that student prayer 
groups must be allowed to meet at public schools that permit other 
organized extracurricular activities the court said a federal law 
aimed at permitting religious clubs in public schools does not 
violate constitutionally required separation of church and state 
im very glad it was an 81 decision it makes it very clear 
that way said bridget mergens mayhew 
its got to be clear to all school officials that they cant 
discriminate against religion any more she said in a telephone 
interview her home at nearby offutt air force base where her 
husband is stationed 
mrs mayhew now 23 was a senior at westside high school in 1985 
when school officials turned down her request to start an 
extracurricular club something like the chess club in which 
members would discuss the bible 
i never thought that it would go this far she recalled 
goodness gracious it was january 1985 i was a senior in high 
school and i thought the day after i asked we would have a club 
started 
but school officials said allowing a bible study group to meet at 
the school after class would violate the constitutionally required 
separation of church and state 
naturally were disappointed with todays ruling but were 
unable to comment further until we have had an opportunity to study 
the high courts opinion and see how it will affect our 
district said di saggau a spokeswoman for the westside community 
schools district 
of course we will comply with the ruling but we just want to 
analyze it further to see how it affects what we have in place 
she said 
mrs mayhew said there are still students at the 1530student 
high school interested in starting such a club 
i wish we could have had it she said i think it would 
have changed the course of things i think for a lot of people i 
think it would have strengthened a lot of people 
westside high principal james findley said today that he knew of 
one student a senior who graduated this year who had been 
interested in starting a bible study club classes ended last week 
for the school year and dont resume until august 
i dont know if well have students interested in it or not 
findley said 
mrs mayhew who was raised as a roman catholic but became a 
member of the assembly of god chuch said discussing and sharing 
religious beliefs strengthens people and that is important for 
teenagers 
its a source of strength to be able to share your faith and 
share what you believe i think its a very important part of that 
age because youre a kid and youve got all these things coming at 
you she said 
she said it would make an alternative available to all those 
different things you can get involved with drugs or whatever

highcapacity fiberoptic telephone lines 
this is a clear indication that the public would favor 
competition and innovation said kent b foster president of gte 
telephone operat 
gte also offers phone service 
burns proposal would amend a draft proposal by the senate 
commerce committee staff that would allow phone companies to offer 
only a video dial tone to subscribers to transmit video 
programming but not to own it 
the committee was scheduled to vote on the proposals thursday 
a house bill by rep rick boucher dva also would allow phone 
companies to own video programming in their service areas but those 
provisions werent included in a draft bill offered last month by 
the house energy and commerce committee staff 
however committee chairman rep john dingell dmich has 
promised boucher hell consider such an amendment larry clinton 
bouchers legislative director said friday 
most observers think its unlikely a bill with such telephone 
provisions will pass congress this year 
the gallup poll conducted april 30may 2 by telephone with 1000 
people found that 
sixtyeight percent of those polled thought they would benefit 
if other companies provided cable service

as officeinthehome home banking and medical consultation 
services 69 percent to 74 percent said they would use classroom 
instruction and library services and choose movies at any time of 
the day the survey did not tell respondents what such services 
would cost 
the polls margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points 
some sources have estimated that as little 3 percent of the 
nations approximately 9000 cable tv communities have more than one

police closed off roads leading to beijings 
university area tonight following a protest in which hundreds of 
students hurled bricks and bottles at security forces on the 
anniversary of the bloody suppression of the prodemocracy movement 
rifletoting police set up roadblocks near universities in 
northwest beijing and stopped most cars from entering all foreign 
journalists were turned back 
one western reporter saw three truckloads of riot police armed 
with shields and rifles entering the university area security 
forces armed with ak47 rifles also patrolled near beijing 
university 
about midnight sunday western reporters outside beijing 
university heard glass breaking and students clapping students 
hurled bottles and other objects at security forces on the street 
beneath their dormitory windows setting off a campus rally of about 
1000 students 
the protest was the boldest antigovernment demonstration since 
troops crushed the prodemocracy movement one year ago and it 
defied the heaviest security beijing has seen since martial law was 
lifted in january several western journalists were roughed up and 
briefly detained by police 
thousands of soldiers and police were out in force throughout the 
city during the day for a fourth straight day tiananmen square was 
sealed off by paramilitary police to prevent any attempt to honor 
victims of the june 34 crackdown 
hundreds and possibly thousands of unarmed civilians were killed 
in last years army attack which cleared the square and the rest of 
central beijing of prodemocracy demonstrators 
students led last springs prodemocracy protests attracting 
workers intellectuals and some peasants to their campaign for 
reform and against official corruption for weeks they occupied 
tiananmen chinas symbolic center today vanloads of police 
guarded streets near the 100acre square 
at the rally at beijing university hundreds of student 
protesters shouted get rid of li peng the chinese premier of 
all the leaders involved in the crackdown is the most widely blamed 
and hated 
the beijing university campus was quiet the rest of the day and 
students went to class university authorities told students they 
could face repercussions if they ignored orders to stay on campus 
the great majority cowed by a year of intimidation obeyed but 
some students said they were prepared to join any protest that 
occurred were tightly controlled but we havent given in 
said one 
thousands of political activists were arrested nationwide in the 
months that followed the june 34 assault and many remain jailed 
without charge 
the government has purged communist reformers and staged a 
massive ideological campaign to stifle dissent all students are 
required to take courses in marxism and mao tsetung and a clean 
political record has become key to getting a good job or a passport 
to visit overseas 
only a few isolated protests have since been attempted although 
anger over the army crackdown remains widespread 
the communist partys official peoples daily in a frontpage 
editorial today said the governments decision to use force to end 
last years demonstrations was absolutely correct and necessary 
to preserve stability 
despite the tight security a middleaged chinese man attempted 
to pass out leaflets near the entrance to the forbidden city across 
the street from the square foreign witnesses said he was quickly 
taken away by police 
a buddhist monk and a disciple who were chanting and beating a 
drum on a bridge at the entrance to the forbidden city were also 
chased off by police it was not clear if they were detained 
on sunday two people were arrested near the square for trying to 
deliver protest messages to western television crews 
convoys of police vehicles with flashing lights and soldiers on 
foot circled the university district sunday evening while security 
forces checked vehicles at major intersections 
witnesses said the beijing university protest began when a small 
group of students hurled bottles rusty bicycle wheels and other 
objects at security forces on the street beneath their dormitory 
windows 
the students then marched to other dormitories gathering 
hundreds of supporters and singing the internationale the anthem of 
the international socialist movement 
several students gave speeches calling for an end to corrupt 
government and respect for intellectuals 
in one address li minqi a junior majoring in economics 
management demanded that land be returned to the peasants and 
factories to the workers 
li was seen being led away possibly by plainclothes police but 
students said later it was not known whether he had been arrested 
the demonstration ended peacefully at about 130 am 
but security forces detained about a dozen foreign journalists 
who had just left the campus and forced them to line up against a 
wall according to one american in the group 
guns were in our faces the american said on condition of 
anonymity he said the security officials knocked los angeles times 
correspondent david holley to the ground and hit his wife fumio 
before allowing the group to leave the holleys later were detained 
again but released after 15 minutes

anniversary of the military crackdown the largest in hong kong

the supreme court today made it easier for 
prosecutors to use items seized by police without court warrants as 
evidence against criminal defendants 
items discovered in plain view during warrantless police 
searches may be used as evidence even if the discovery was not 
inadvertent the justices said by a 72 vote in a california case 
clarifying its 19yearold plain view doctrine the court said 
inadvertent discovery is not a necessary condition 
the two keys to whether such warrantless seizures are 
constitutional the court said are that an items incriminating 
character be immediately apparent and police had lawful authority to 
be where the item was found 
even though inadvertence is a characteristic of most legitimate 
plain view seizures it is not a necessary condition justice 
john paul stevens wrote for the court 
justices william j brennan and thurgood marshall dissented 
brennan wrote for the two that such seizures by police violate the 
constitutions fourth amendment which bans unreasonable searches 
and seizures 
the court today ignores the explicit language of the fourth 
amendment which protects possessory interest in the same manner as 
it protects privacy interests brennan said 
the decision upheld the criminal conviction of terry brice 
horton sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison for the 
1985 holdup of erwin paul wallaker the treasurer of a san jose coin 
club 
wallaker was returning home from a coin show with two briefcases 
containing 10000 in cash and 20000 worth of coins 
he was accosted by two people wearing halloween masks who stunned 
him with an electrical device and robbed the cash coins and his 
jewelry 
wallaker told police he recognized hortons voice a distinct 
southern drawl 
the police searched hortons home and found among other things 
two stun guns but the court warrant authorizing the search of 
hortons home mentioned only the cash coins and jewelry not the 
weapons 
while searching for the robberys proceeds which they did not 
find police officers found the stun guns out in plain view 
california courts allowed the guns to be used as evidence against 
horton and those rulings were upheld today 
the items seized from hortons home were discovered during a 
lawful search authorized by a valid warrant stevens wrote for the 
court 
he added when they were discovered it was immediately 
apparent to the officer that they constituted incriminating 
evidence he had probable cause to believe that the weapons 
had been used in the crime he was investigating the seizure was 
authorized by the plain view doctrine 
the case is horton vs california 887164

president bush said today us allies gave the 
superpower summit a very very positive review even as he 
acknowledged theres some problems that remain to be solved 
bush said he had conferred late sunday by phone on the outcome of 
the summit with west german chancellor helmut kohl british prime 
minister margaret thatcher and former president reagan who was 
meeting in san francisco today for breakfast with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
bush dispatched secretary of state james a baker iii to 
copenhagen denmark today to meet with his soviet counterpart and 
germanys foreign minister about european security following the 
unification of germany 
i am pleased with the results and i think the reception from 
the american people was rather clear bush said as he began to 
brief his cabinet on the fourday meeting with gorbachev 
he won a sustained round of applause from the cabinet the 
friendliest audience in town as be braced for a congressional cold 
shoulder over the provisional trade agreement that so pleased 
gorbachev 
theres some problems bush told the cabinet at brief remarks 
during a picturetaking session i never said there wouldnt be 
the president said he talked to reagan who had five summits of 
his own with the soviet leader to give him a briefing as to what 
he might anticipate at his breakfast 
the mood from the allies so far the ones ive talked to 
has been very very positive bush said 
well have to wait and see what the response is from around the 
world but so far our experts have been very pleased bush said 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said later today that 
gorbachevs threat to suspend exit visas for soviet jews could cause 
some problems suggesting it did not square with the soviet 
leaders assurances of freer emigration policies 
gorbachev on sunday suggested he would consider suspending the 
visas if israel continues to settle the emigrants in occupied 
territories 
we view it with concern we want open emigration fitzwater 
said 
he said the status of jewish emigration from the soviet union is 
one thing that bush will consider when he makes a final judgement on 
sending to congress the trade pact he formalized with gorbachev at 
the summit 
meanwhile fitzwater announced that east german prime minister 
lothar de maiziere will visit bush at the white house next monday on 
june 11 it is the first time an east german leader has ever been to 
the white house fitzwater said 
the two will discuss a number of topics related to german 
unification the spokesman said 
the cabinet applauded bush before reporters were let into the 
cabinet room asked what the applause was about bush cracked to 
reporters my scintillating personality i guess 
despite sharp differences remaining on the fate of the baltics 
and on the military alignment of a reunified germany bush and 
gorbachev are heralding their summit gains and predicting another 
1990 session to nail down arms treaties that eluded them this time 
they ended their second summit on sunday speaking warmly of each 
other and proclaiming the meeting a big success neither of us 
tried to cover over the differences bush said 
bushs decision to sign a trade pact with gorbachev without first 
winning concessions on lithuania has drawn reproach from both 
parties 
however bush has said he will only send the measure to congress 
if the supreme soviet passes a liberalized emigration law 
and a gesture by gorbachev in lightening up on lithuania in 
exchange for the prize of the trade treaty could quickly turn the 
situation around in congress 
both leaders voiced hope that they can meet again before the end 
of the year gorbachev invited bush to moscow to sign treaties to 
cut longrange nuclear missiles and trim conventional forces in 
europe 
bush and gorbachev also talked about having regular perhaps 
annual meetings without the usual summit fanfare of 21gun salutes 
state dinners and military bands 
bush said were now at a stage in the ussoviet relationship 
and indeed in world history where we should miss no opportunity to 
complete the extraordinary tasks before us 
gorbachev said of his summit host this is the kind of person 
to do business with 
the two leaders made significant progress on the nuclear pact 
signing a framework agreement to cut arsenals by 30 percent and 
pledging to sign the completed strategic arms reduction treaty 
start by years end 
this is the first time that were not just limiting but we 
will be reducing the most devastating means of warfare gorbachev 
said 
but deep divisions remained between them on levels of troops and 
tanks in europe a dispute directly related to another disagreement 
over the future political and military face of a unified germany 
other disputes also loomed in particular the continuing 
stalemate over lithuania and the other rebellious baltic republics 
bush called the baltic standoff one of the thorns in the side of 
an overall relationship 
for his part gorbachev who gave no ground on lithuania at the 
washington talks brushed off the topic he repeated a favorite 
recent line that bush would have restored constitutional order 
within 24 hours had a state in the united states declared 
independence as did lithuania 
lack of major progress on the baltic stalemate is building 
substantial congressional opposition to the trade pact and bush 
conceded that gorbachev had given him no assurances that moscow was 
any closer to lifting its economic embargo against lithuania 
im not sure anything has changed bush said

former san francisco mayor dianne feinstein got encouraging news 
monday from two new polls in the california governors race as she 
and scores of candidates played out the final hours of primary 
campaigns in nine states 
in the often nasty democratic primary campaign feinstein 
maintained a lead over state attorney general john van de kamp in 
the latest statewide surveys for months the two candidates have 
attacked each other on issues ranging from abortion and crime to who 
could best handled the states fiscal affairs 
other new polls showed close races tuesday for gubernatorial 
nominations in alabama iowa and new mexico in north carolina a 
runoff between two democrats will determine who challenges 
republican sen jesse helms while four montana republicans were 
vying for the chance to run against democratic sen max baucus 
baucus was among seven incumbent senators facing token primary 
opposition at most on tuesday 
the others were democrats bill bradley of new jersey howell 
heflin of alabama and tom harkin of iowa and republicans thad 
cochran of mississippi pete domenici of new mexico and larry 
pressler of south dakota 
except for cochran who will have no democratic opponent in 
november renomination isnt necessarily a free ticket to another 
term 
harkin faces a tough reelection race against gop rep tom tauke 
while heflin and pressler also are under challenge from potentially 
strong opponents heflins foe in november will be republican bill 
cabannis and pressler will come up against democrat ted muenster 
with his outspoken conservative views helms attracts both 
intense support and equally strong opposition the democrats who 
must decide between harvey gantt and mike easley for their nominee 
hope to capitalize on the latter in the general election campaign 
gantt led a sixcandidate field in the may 8 primary but failed 
to reached the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff the former mayor 
of charlotte is seeking to become the first black nominated for 
statewide office in north carolina 
the race for the democratic nomination for governor of alabama 
was headed for a runoff with none of the five contenders likely to 
get the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round the 
top two finishers would be on the ballot for a runoff june 26 to 
decide who challenges republican gov guy hunt 
a birmingham newshuntsville times poll published sunday said 
former gov fob james had the support of 261 percent followed by 
state attorney general don siegelman with 256 percent rep ronnie 
flippo 205 percent teacherlobbyist paul hubbert 201 percent and 
state sen charles bishop 33 percent the poll had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points 
the biggest 1990 prize is the california governors office 
republican gov george deukmejian is retiring after two terms and 
the gop recruited sen pete wilson to enter the race to succeed him 
reelected to the senate in 1988 with 53 percent of the vote wilson 
became the immediate favorite to keep the office in republican hands 
with the 1990 census likely to give california six new house 
seats starting with the 1992 election control of the governors 
office could determine which party draws the new district lines 
democrats already control both legislative chambers 
in addition to targeting the governors race republicans also 
are sponsoring two ballot initiatives on redistricting in 
california one would take it out of the hands of the legislature 
the other would give the governor an absolute veto over any plan 
a new los angeles times poll said feinstein had a 13point lead 
a gain of two points over a similar survey early in may the poll 
gave the former mayor 42 percent and van de kamp 29 percent there 
were 29 percent still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor 
candidates on the democratic primary ballot the survey had a 5 
percentage point margin of error 
mervin fields california poll which gave feinstein a slim 3 
percent lead earlier this month reported that margin had opened up 
to 8 points over van de kamp 4234 in polling that concluded 
sunday it had a 35 percentage point margin of error 
a new iowa poll in the race for the democratic nomination for 
governor was published sunday in thedes moines register and said 
iowa house speaker don avenson had moved into the lead with support 
from 32 percent of those surveyed compared with 25 percent for 
state attorney general tom miller former banker john chrystal was 
at 19 percent and 20 percent said they were undecided the survey 
had a margin of error of 39 percentage points 
the winner of the democratic primary will face republican gov 
terry branstad in the general election 
in new mexico a new poll published sunday in the albuquerque 
journal said state senate minority leader les houston and former 
legislator frank bond each had the support of 292 percent of the 
registered republicans asked their preference in the gop 
gubernatorial primary

427 percent while state attorney general paul bardacke was 
supported by 315 percent the new mexico survey had a margin of 
error of 4 percentage points on the democratic side and 5 percentage

capitalism reared its head at stanford 
university today as students scrambled for the last remaining 
tickets to see soviet president mikhail gorbachev and the wealthy 
offered fistfuls of cash for those ducats 
students erik jorgensen 21 and alex levy 20 stood in line 
from 2 am hoping for a shot at tickets that had not been picked 
up a lottery had been held to distribute 1700 seats for 
gorbachevs talk and 6000 other tickets to the rest of the events 
on his university visit 
gorbachev probably would have felt right at home this 
morning said jorgensen the lines we stood in were very much 
like the food lines in the soviet union 
they decided to hang on to their tickets but a friend sold his 
for 425 to a san jose doctor jorgensen said 
the university set up an official computer lottery system to 
distribute the coveted tickets may 29 but free enterprise 
immediately florished with talk of scalping tickets for as much as 
1800 apiece 
two sophomores jeff vierling and marlowe johnson said they had 
heard the top price was 1800 they could only attest personally to 
a 1400 sale 
vierling a 19yearold electrical engineering major and 
johnson a 21yearold international relations major sat on a curb 
today with a sign asking for serious offers only they told those 
who stopped they wanted 1000 or more for each of their two tickets 
its airplane tickets its a lot of things its a cd 
player said vierling 
added johnson who wants to finance a european trip i can 
probably see him better on tv 
stanford officials programmed computers to randomly decide who 
among the universitys staff and students would attend the events 
students accounted for about 60 percent of the winners list which 
was published in university publications 
however students were allocated only 550 seats in the 1700seat 
memorial auditorium for gorbachevs speech the other were divided 
among faculty staff dignitaries and the media 
five thousand ticketholding members of the stanford community 
were allowed to pass through security lines to see gorbachev and his 
wife raisa greeted by stanford president donald kennedy and former 
secretary of state george shultz 
about 550 others were allowed access to the cordonedoff lawn of 
the business school to watch as the soviet president was escorted to 
the auditorium for his scheduled halfhour speech 
students gawkers and soviet security guards gathered outside 
stanfords memorial auditorium several hours before gorbachev was 
scheduled to arrive 
sonoma resident robin nyder said she had a pass to stand near the 
auditorium but not to see the speech 
i told my fiance if i have a choice between shaking his hand 
and taking a picture forget the photo nyder said

lithuanias president said today he hoped soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev would reassess his stance toward the 
breakaway baltic state after returning from the washington summit 
but president vytautas landsbergis added in an interview with the 
voice of america radio that he did not hear any encouraging words 
from gorbachev during his meeting with president bush 
the worst would have been if mikhail gorbachev came out with 
the impression that everything he is doing visavis lithuania is 
permitted landsbergis said in the interview a transcript of 
which was provided in english to the associated press 
landsbergis said he hoped the soviet leader would thoroughly 
review the matter when he returned home 
he accused gorbachev of using propaganda methods in dealing 
with the republic which declared independence from moscow march 11 
and triggered a kremlim economic embargo of all fuel and most food 
supplies 
gorbachev has demanded that the republic revoke the declaration 
before starting negotiations on lithuanian secession on the basis of 
the soviet constitution 
landsbergis today reitereated lithuanias refusal to reverse its 
declaration saying i dont think well ever be able to take this 
step according to the us governmentrun voa 
at the summit bush and gorbachev agreed to a trade pact that 
bush said is conditioned only on the soviet governments approval of 
liberalized emigration laws bush previously had said moscow also 
must end its blockade against lithuania but he changed that 
position sunday 
landsbergis told voa that if the west continues to allow 
gorbachevs destructive policies toward lithuania the baltic 
state would seek more support from the russian federation the 
largest of the 15 soviet republics 
kazimiera prunskiene lithuanias prime minister told the voa 
that lithuania is looking forward to dealing with democratic 
russia she said a delegation from russia was in lithuania 
preparing to negotiate direct agreements outside soviet authority 
populist reformer boris yeltsin the communist party maverick who 
has openly challenged gorbachev was elected to the russian 
federation presidency last week and promised to support lithuania 
after he forms his new government 
mrs prunskiene who has met separately with bush and gorbachev 
in recent weeks said she believed gorbachev would modify his 
position on lithuania after returning home 
its one thing to talk tough in americas forums and to disply 
this firm position by the ussr and gorbachev himself but it is 
another thing to understand that the us congress as well as the 
situation in the soviet union are unfavorable to his rigid position 
she told voa 
the us congress must still approve the trade pact and some 
lawmakers already have said they would not allow the soviet union to 
become a mostfavorednation trading partner until gorbachev ends 
his economic squeeze on lithuania 
the mostfavorednation designation qualifies a trading partner 
for the lowest us tariffs

jury selection began today in the drug and 
perjury trial of mayor marion barry as the mayor blasted federal 
prosecutors for using tactics more befitting a totalitarian kind 
of society 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to all 14 charges against him 
sources close to the case have said his lawyers have been conducting 
plea bargain talks with federal prosecutors 
the mayor accompanied by his wife effi entered the courthouse 
through a side door without speaking to reporters inside the 
courtroom more than 100 potential jurors were given questionnaires 
to fill out designed to gauge their fitness for the jury that will 
hear the case 
in an interview hours earlier with a local radio station the 
thirdterm mayor launched a preemptive strike against the 
prosecution 
its frightening that since 1983 my family have had to go 
through my mail being opened my bank accounts checked my tax 
return looked at my phones tapped 
can you imagine you cant even have a conference in your 
bedroom with your wife for fear that theyre listening to anything 
you may say its been a thing that you thought may happen in a 
totalitarian kind of society 
the mayor also said a local television station has gotten a 
copy of the tape from the prosecutors theyre trying to figure out 
now how to show it he said in an apprent reference to the 
videotape that made during the fbi sting operation that resulted in 
barrys arrest on drug charges on jan 18 
judy smith spokeswoman for us attorney jay b stephens said 
the office would have no comment the station wrctv also said it 
would have no comment 
outside the courthouse nearly two dozen guardian angels paced 
silently wearing their trademark red berets holding aloft signs 
calling for the mayor to resign the guardian angels are a 
selfappointed anticrime group 
about 125 prospective jurors began filling out a lengthy 
questionaire designed to evaluate their fitness to sit on the 
12member jury and another group of 125 was slated to fill out the 
same paperwork this afternoon the press and public were not 
permitted in the courtroom of us district judge thomas penfield 
jackson 
interviews of the prospective jurors were expected to begin 
tuesday in addition to the dozen jurors six alternates will be 
picked 
federal prosecutors have indicated for months that they are as 
interested in getting barry out of office as they are in winning a 
jury verdict 
sources said sunday that stephens was holding out for a felony 
plea and a deal that would have the mayor leave office while barry 
was willing to consider only misdemeanors 
a felony plea or conviction would bar the mayor from holding 
office and from seeking reelection a misdemeanor conviction would 
not 
barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine 
possession three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his 
alleged drug use and one misdemeanor conspiracy count that alleges 
he consorted with at least 10 people on 20 occasions over the past 
five years to buy and use cocaine barry has pleaded innocent to all 
charges 
barry attended a church rally sunday night and called the months 
since his jan 18 arrest the most difficult time in my life 
i aint gonna waste time barry said ive come too far 
from where i started from after a standing ovation from the 
crowd he expressed confidence that his legal crisis will not bring 
him down 
prospective jurors were being asked to fill out detailed 
questionnaires today and were expected to undergo questioning by the 
defense and prosecution starting by tuesday 
twelve jurors and six alternates will be picked from the pool 
and it is expected that a week or more will be needed to empanel the 
group 
while barry has said he only needs one juror to vote against 
convicting him some of his top aides and political advisers have 
indicated they are extremely reluctant to see the case come to 
trial sources familiar with the mayors legal situation said 
barrys attorney r kenneth mundy and stephens were continuing 
pleabargain negotiations that began 10 days ago 
barry has not publicly revealed his reelection plans but he has 
made a series of campaignstyle appearances around the nations 
capital since returning in march from seven weeks of substance abuse 
treatment 
a source familiar the pleabargain talks said sunday the two 
sides are still far apart but that neither mundy nor stephens 
felt pressure to strike a quick deal 
there is a feeling that they have until the end of jury 
selection at least said the source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity they are continuing to talk and they are not so bogged 
down as to cut off the discussions 
the papers jurors were given to fill out asks more than 100 
questions around their knowledge of the barry case their general 
feelings about the mayor the city government and the various 
federal law enforcement agencies that participated in the lengthy 
investigation that led to barrys arrest and indictments 
at the church service a mixture of top barry aides and his 
former civil rights colleagues paid tribute to the mayor 
i wouldnt trade this evening for anything in the world said 
barry who praised his wife effi and his mother mattie cummings 
for their support 
restaurateur jeffrey gildenhorn said afterward this was a 
summation of his career all the things hes done where we go 
from here no one knows

when alexander p russo returned from his 
stint as a world war ii combat artist he couldnt bear to draw 
people he had seen too many soldiers riddled with gunfire too many 
mangled bodies 
i couldnt paint a figure for years said russo who 
witnessed the allied invasion of the normandy beaches on june 6 
1944 i wanted to do landscapes i was trying to get my mind back 
to a positive focus 
russo was one of eight artists in the navys combat art section 
which he joined after the dday invasion they lived with the 
troops and followed them into battle capturing the fighting on 
sketchpads and later on canvas 
i think good art or great art captures the sense of the 
situation in this case it was the essence of battle the horror of 
battle said russo a retired art professor from hood college in 
this western maryland city 
but russo who taught at the corcoran school of art in 
washington dc and chaired hoods art department for 15 years 
does not want to be known solely as a combat artist his 
contemporary art which bridges realism and abstraction is in 
collections and museums in the united states and europe 
im a functioning artist the war was just one phase he said 
last week it was an opportunity to be creative but it was just a 
beginning 
russo was 20 when he joined the navy in october 1942 after 
completing art studies at pratt institute in new york city as part 
of an amphibious intelligence unit he made shoreline drawings and 
plaster terrain models 
he sketched troops landing in sicily and fires raging in london 
after german bombing attacks 
russos firefighters in london at night is part of an 
exhibit at the washington navy yard in the nations capital the 
painting in brown black red and orange tones depicts firefighters 
dousing flames that dart from windows and roofs toward a dark sky 
fortyfour years ago wednesday russo landed with thousands of 
troops on the beaches of normandy i was moved by some things that 
the others were not subtle things like troops waiting or grave 
diggers pausing russo said 
in his work from normandy russo painted to the burial 
ground which shows soldiers tending to the dead on a hillside 
four soldiers rest from digging two carry a covered stretcher to a 
cemetery studded with crosses 
later as part of the combat art section russo spent months in 
washington developing his sketches into complete works the unit was 
founded by griffith baily coale who persuaded the navy to let 
artists accompany ships into action and record the battles in ways 
that photographers and journalists could not 
there was practically no color photography done during world 
war ii it was too bloody expensive said john d barnett curator 
of the navy art collection at the naval yard the color wasnt 
true so they figured they were better off with black and white 
russo completed 250 drawings sketches and paintings that are 
part of the navys historic record of the war 
it was the beginning of a search for deeper values that im 
still searching for and still trying to represent in my work he 
said

speaker thomas s foley has restored calm even 
boredom to a house of representatives that a year ago was torn by 
the downfall of his predecessor jim wright some democrats complain 
the price of peace is too high 
it is still holding foley said of the serenity that he made 
his top priority after being sworn in as speaker a year ago 
wednesday i think theres a better communication and a better 
feeling between the parties and the leadership on each side 
few would disagree sparks seldom fly during floor debates in the 
way they did under wright who was seen as imposing his agenda on 
the house and squelching dissent among both democrats and 
republicans 
wright resigned may 31 1989 after being formally accused of 69 
instances of violating house rules including charges he had 
circumvented limits on outside income through bulk sales of a book 
he wrote and charges he had improperly accepted 145000 in gifts 
from a fort worth texas businessman with a direct interest in 
legislation 
i dont have the sense that i have to fight this leadership 
said rep tim penny dminn a maverick conservative who often was 
at odds with wright foley and his leadership team penny said 
dont feel driven to play every floor vote as if it were a fight to 
the death 
there is more of an attempt to be fair to all sides he said 
house minority leader robert michel rill said there is a new 
atmosphere of bipartisan trust were more inclined to try and 
solve any differences between the two of us with nobody around 
he said 
but calm is not everything said penny and several others who are 
either house members or close observers of the institution as they 
look ahead to congressional elections this fall and down the road 
to the 1992 presidential campaign they see a lack of any issue that 
could help define the democratic party 
under foleys leadership the house has in recent weeks passed 
major legislation on child care clean air and civil rights for the 
handicapped but on the years highestprofile issue bushs capital 
gains tax cut foley was defeated last september when he lost the 
support of one in four house democrats 
no one wants to return to the debilitating last months of wright 
when the institution was paralyzed but griping is growing louder 
that foley the nations highestranking elected democrat is too 
slow to take on a popular president and be his partys political as 
well as legislative leader 
i dont think theres a sense across america that were doing 
anything about anything penny said we are too focused on 
ourselves getting along with each other is fine but what we 
are communicating to the american public is that were afraid to 
make any decisions 
we want the leaders to lead said rep dave mccurdy dokla 
another conservative we want to know what the priorities are 
what the agenda is and to move out aggressively on that agenda 
foley and his top lieutenants majority leader richard gephardt 
dmo and whip william h gray iii dpa were understandably 
gunshy after watching wrights demise and the abrupt resignation of 
former whip tony coelho mccurdy said but the team now has 
established itself and it is time to move ahead he said 
wright himself now living in fort worth texas and doing some 
speaking and writing obviously sees some shortcomings in his 
successors but declined in an interview to go into any detail 
things are not moving with perceptible clarity and direction 
he said but he said foleys conciliatory style is in some ways 
much better than his own impatience and predicted tom will be 
speaker for a long time 
in many ways the lack of a schism between democrats and 
republicans is the product of a political scene that goes far beyond 
foley the democratcontrolled congress faces a popular president in 
george bush and one who himself is naturally averse to 
confrontation 
i cant stop him from adopting democratic ideas endorsing 
democratic philosophies conceding democratic priorities foley 
said in an interview i cant say stop get across the road 
stop talking about child care and clean air and the environment and 
be a republican in the same old nasty way as the last president 
ronald reagan 
foley said he is well aware of the unrest in his party among 
those who desire conflict but he said times have changed 
it would be a bad mistake for us as a party to sharpen the 
lines by being something we arent he said i think the issues 
are going to define themselves there will be differences but 
maybe not as hard and clear as they were with ronald reagan who had 
an ideological cut in a different direction

the death of a rare white bengal tiger was 
caused by a stuffed toy that it swallowed weeks ago officials said 
the 2yearold male tiger named mwelu drowned sunday while 
apparently suffering severe stomach pains visitors noticed the 
tiger struggling in a pool before it sank said david conrod a 
spokesman for busch gardens theme park 
the remains of a small stuffed animal were found in the tigers 
upper intestines said dr john olsen chief veterinarian 
since the tiger apparently ate the toy three to six weeks ago 
two gallstones had formed around it further blocking digestion and 
creating what must have been painful stomach attacks olsen said 
we ask that visitors not feed the animals or put things in the 
displays but sometimes it happens conrod said sometimes 
things will be thrown in that people think the animals will play 
with 
the tiger was one of about 140 white bengals left in the world 
all of them in captivity park officials said

officer buck has been shot six times in 
the line of duty which doesnt bother his fellow officers a bit 
the people who have shot him arent very happy about it though 
officer buck is a decoy deer who lives well exists to get 
shot 
the 1yearold decoy which was given its nickname by officials 
at the pennsylvania game commission is placed along roads to help 
wardens nab people who illegally hunt from the highway 
critics say the ploy amounts to entrapment game wardens consider 
it a stroke of genius 
hes saved a lot of deer said dale sleasman a state game 
official youd be surprised how many guys came up to us and said 
we saw your decoy but we didnt shoot it the decoy wasnt even 
there 
aaron stiffey sr 46 of bolivar and james wagner jr 31 of 
new florence recently were convicted of shooting officer buck from 
a road in rural westmoreland county just east of pittsburgh their 
attorney is appealing their convictions saying the fake deer is 
used to entrap people 
thats the only reason that deer was there to entice someone 
to shoot at it said lawyer richard pohl this fivepoint rack 
is a neon sign saying come shoot me 
patrick noonan an assistant district attorney in westmoreland 
county said officer buck merely gives people an opportunity to 
commit a crime 
this is no different than an undercover officer dressed up to 
solicit prostitution he said 
sleasman said officer buck once started an argument between two 
men one carried a rifle and was preparing to shoot while a friend 
tried to talk him out of shooting the bogus buck 
the unarmed man took off running down a hill shouting and 
clapping his hands and trying to scare it away he must have run 
about 60 yards shouting and screaming the whole time sleasman 
said 
he finally got to about 10 feet of the deer and turned around 
and said you might as well shoot it i think its frozen

american workers productivity has plunged at a 
27 percent annual rate so far this year the poorest showing since 
the 198182 recession as labor costs have continued to increase 
the government said monday 
its the worst of both possible worlds said economist david 
jones of aubrey g lanston amp co 
increased productivity or getting each worker to produce more 
for each hour he or she works is vital to increasing americans 
standard of living without inflation many economists say 
the first quarter is a very dismal statement on that score 
said allen sinai chief economist at the boston co 
donald ratajczak director of georgia state universitys economic 
forecasting center said poor productivity might mean americans 
standard of living is going to drift backward 
it also weakens the nations ability to compete internationally 
analysts said 
while productivity was falling unit labor costs a key gauge of 
future price inflation shot up at an annual rate of 7 percent 
thats putting a squeeze on profits sinai said 
businesses cant keep on employing people at those costs with 
so little production he said 
the 27 percent productivity drop was the worst performance since 
productivity fell at a rate of 55 percent in the fourth quarter of 
1981 the labor department said 
private analysts said much of the decline was related to the 
overall slowdown of the economy and was typical of an economy at the 
end of expansion 
the gross national product the total output of goods and 
services grew at a sluggish 13 percent annual rate for the first 
quarter 
mondays report which provided revised figures on the first 
quarter of 1990 showed the nations lagging productivity was far 
worse than earlier reported original data showed productivity 
falling 1 percent 
the gnp growth of 13 percent had also been revised downward from 
preliminary data showing 21 percent growth 
the 7 percent jump in unit labor costs for the januarymarch 
period compared with a 45 percent increase during all of 1989 
hourly labor costs a major inflation measure for businesses 
rose at an annual rate of 41 percent in the first quarter of 1990 
those costs increased by 55 percent for all of 1989 
the report provided one bit of good news productivity in the 
manufacturing sector climbed 49 percent so far this year a huge 
improvement over the 2 percent increase during all of 1989 
unit labor costs in that sector dropped 13 percent compared 
with the 22 percent increase during all of last year 
jones said factory workers productivity was encouraging because 
it might mean businesses have become leaner and meaner with the 
financial restructuring of the 1980s 
maybe the one positive fallout of the takeover craze has been 
the cutbacks of excessive management and layoffs of unproductive 
workers jones said 
ratajczak said manufacturers are feeling the heat of foreign 
competition the strongest 
we dont know what its going to take for retailers to become 
more efficient he said 
total business productivity including farming fell 21 percent 
for the first quarter compared with a 11 percent gain for all of 
1989 
since 1982 productivity growth has averaged 18 percent a year 
while a slight improvement over the 12 percent average growth rate 
in the 1970s it was still far below th 33 percent rate of increase 
posted in the two decades after world war ii 
during all of last year productivity rose just 09 percent the 
poorest showing since the 198182 recession 
mondays report showed that output in the nonfarm sector rose 1 
percent during the first quarter of 1990 well below the 39 percent 
increase in the number of hours worked

volodymyr ivashko a protege of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev received 60 percent of the votes in the ukrainian supreme 
soviet parliament according to rukh press international or rukh 
it is an arm of the nationalist ukrainian peoples front 
opposition members and protesters objected to ivashkos holding 
both the ukrainian party leadership and the republics presidency 
according to the unofficial rukh press which has proved reliable in 
the past 
gorbachev also has been criticized for holding both the 
presidency and the post as general secretary of the communist party 
thousands of protesters gathered outside the parliament building 
monday in the ukrainian capital of kiev and chanted ivashko out 
and shame on communists the report said 
activists in the supreme soviet said they may boycott future 
sessions and form their own shadow parliament rukh reported 
the ukraine is the secondlargest of the soviet unions 15 
republics with 51 million people its extensive heavy industry and

soviet union like other soviet republics the ukraine has a 
nationalist movement that has blossomed since gorbachev came to 
power in 1985 
ivashko 58 took over as ukrainian party chief last september 
from hardliner vladimir shcherbitsky and was made a full member of 
the partys ruling politburo in december he replaces valentina 
shevchenko as president formally known as the parliament chairman 
ivashko is considered a relative moderate in the communist party 
and a protege of gorbachev he has spoken out against growing 
nationalism in the ukraine that puts him at odds with rukh the 
popular movement whose platform includes both prodemocracy and 
nationalist elements

according to the interfax news agency which is affiliated with 
staterun radio moscow he defeated academician igor yukhnovsky who

professor and kiev communist party official ivan saly interfax 
said 
rukh said communist officials predicted that ivashko soon would 
step down from his party post to defuse the controversy

communist party general secretary at a national party congress in 
july although he has denied such rumors gorbachev says holding 
both the presidency and party leadership is necessary for political 
stability

colombian president virgilio barco told 
new graduates of mit his alma mater on monday that the world of 
the future belongs not to the generals but to the entrepreneurs 
it seems that the longrunning match between karl marx and adam 
smith is finally coming to an end said barco 
but the 68yearold barco also cautioned free market policies 
should not be used as an excuse for the lack of political will 
whether it is assuring justice or fighting drug trafficking or 
providing basic education and health care 
free market economics is not a magic wand which somehow will 
relieve us of the obligation to care for our fellow human beings 
barcos 25minute address in english was the main speech to 1712 
degree recipients and 8000 guests he was interrupted repeatedly by 
applause for his comments on human rights the worlds new and 
stillfragile democracies and the environment 
barco received an engineering degree from mit in 1943 a decade 
later he did graduate work in economics from 1970 to 1980 he 
served on the board that runs the school the mit corporation 
barco finishes his fouryear term in august and is to be 
succeeded by cesar gaviria who won election last month after a 
campaign season that was scarred by vicious drugrelated violence 
barco said he didnt want to talk only about drug violence his 
theme was more global 
when the postwar world concentrated its attention on eastwest 
tensions and the contest for military advantage he said the 
developed world ignored oppression in latin america 
we are now able to look beyond the myopia of the cold war 
beyond our previously clouded horizon to where a new world is 
waiting a world where entrepreneurs and innovators will lead the 
way not the generals of yesterday 
on tuesday barco meets with president bush the two men are 
expected to continue discussions that arose at februarys antidrug 
summit in cartagena colombia

nancy reagan and raisa gorbachev exchanged 
smiles and handshakes today and renewed a relationship that mrs 
reagan said had been misunderstood 
as former president ronald reagan and soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev chatted on a sofa in the soviet counsel generals home 
their wives perched on chairs and talked 
afterward mrs reagan characterized her hourlong meeting with 
mrs gorbachev as very nice 
i think theres been a great misunderstanding about our 
relationship mrs reagan told reporters she wore a black and 
white outfit while mrs gorbachev had donned a more businesslike 
gray suit 
mrs reagans kind words for mrs gorbachev contrasted with her 
characterization of her in my turn her memoir of her white 
house years 
from the moment we met she talked and talked and talked so 
much that i could barely get a word in edgewise or otherwise 
mrs reagan wrote perhaps it was insecurity on her part but 
during about a dozen encounters in three different countries my 
fundamental impression of raisa gorbachav was that she never stopped 
talking 
or lecturing to be more accurate mrs reagan wrote 
and the last time mrs gorbachev visited washington before this 
trip in december 1987 she irritated mrs reagan by observing that 
the white house was more a museum than a regular house

a neurologist who plays the trumpet 
wants to know why some people have perfect pitch and others cant 
carry a tune in a bucket 
it is talent or it is teachable asks dr louis s russo 
jr a member of the first coast pop orchestra 
hes looking for clues by studying a group of professional 
musicians and a group of people who have never had a music lesson 
as children we develop language and grammar skills by 
listening to our parents talk said russo why is it that people 
develop these music skills long before they go to school yet many 
people cant even hum a tune we all listen to music even though we 
all cant play it 
russo first tested eight righthanded musicians with the 
jacksonville symphony orchestra all were connected to a brain 
mapping device and monitored while reading a magazine article 
sightreading music singing a simple song from memory and while 
listening to bach piano music 
the brain maps showed when each musician read words the left 
part of the brain was activated research has shown language is 
processed by the left side of the brain the right side was 
activated when they sang or listened to music 
but when the musicians were asked to sight read a piece of music 
both sides of the brain began working 
so the right side of the brain is necessary in all musical 
functions but the left side is activated as the functions become 
more complex he said 
seven people without musical training were given the same test 
and while russo is still analyzing the results from that group he 
said preliminary examinations indicate that all the nonmusicians 
lack is training 
everyone can be taught to learn to read music he said

foreign ministers from 35 nations open 
an eastwest human rights conference tuesday hoping to rewrite the 
ground rules in europe so they protect ethnic minorities and 
guarantee the rule of law 
backstage us secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze will press ahead with talks on 
germanys future picking up the thread from the weekend summit in 
washington 
the monthlong conference is likely to produce a final document 
endorsing principles that just one year ago were out of reach free 
elections pluralist politics and freedom of speech assembly and 
religion 
more radical proposals such as establishing a committee to 
mediate ethnic disputes and possibly a security force are likely to 
meet resistance 
it is still too early to say if we can find a consensus but 
all governments now agree to move ahead toward a human rights 
declaration said per fergo who heads the host delegation 
the chief of the us delegation max kampelman said in an 
interview the conference will discuss creating a mechanism to 
mediate disputes involving ethnic minorities he gave as an example 
complaints of discrimination by ethnic hungarians living in romania 
foreign ministers will meet in copenhagen for two days 
delegations led by senior diplomats will draft the final conference 
document 
the copenhagen conference is an outgrowth of the 1975 helsinki 
final act which reduced tensions in europe and set minimum 
standards of behavior by states toward their citizens 
the 35 signatories of the helsinki accords form the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe they are the united states 
canada and all european nations except albania which now wants to 
join 
the first conference was held in paris last june and ended 
without a final document the final meeting will be held in moscow 
in 1991 
first on the agenda for the meeting of foreign ministers is 
creating a committee that will prepare for a summit later this year 
all european nations except bulgaria were sending foreign ministers 
the copenhagen conference takes place in a new europe ripe for 
agreement it also comes as new pillars are being sought to support 
a reshaped europe many leaders look to the conference as the 
foundation of the new structure 
baker and shevardnadze were to continue talks on whether a 
unified germany can be a member of nato president bush and soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev held extensive but inconclusive talks on 
the german question in washington 
gorbachev fearful of a powerful germany on the soviet border 
fully integrated into the western military alliance has said he 
wants the issue discussed in a paneuropean council possibly 
evolving from the conference 
the united states also has spoken of a wider monitoring role for 
the international group

police with rifles blocked roads to beijings 
university area monday and heavy security elsewhere in the city 
stifled dissent on the first anniversary of the bloody demise of 
chinas democracy movement 
all gates to beijing university a center of last years 
political activism were locked at 8 pm the public was barred from 
tiananmen square the center of the protests for the fourth day 
the few individuals who tried to protest the military crackdown 
were quickly arrested 
outside china people from mongolia to paris and czechoslovakia 
remembered the anniversary with hunger strikes marches and 
candlelight vigils the largest commemmoration was in hong kong 
where tens of thousands of people jammed victoria park and watched 
videotapes of chinese dissidents in exile urging people not to 
forget the beijing killings 
in sharp contrast to the dramatic reforms of eastern europe in 
the past year china has retreated into ideological orthodoxy since 
the june 34 1989 crackdown all students are required to take 
courses in marxism and mao tsetung thought and a clean political 
record has become key to getting a good job or a passport 
thousands who participated in last years uprising remain behind 
bars many without being charged or tried 
police set up roadblocks near universities in northwest beijing 
on monday night and would not allow foreign journalists to pass one 
western reporter saw three truckloads of riot police armed with 
shields and rifles entering the university area 
security forces armed with ak47 rifles patrolled outside beijing 
university plainclothes police many with walkietalkies kept an 
eye on students 
for the third night students smashed beer bottles bottle 
in chinese sounds much like senior leader deng xiaopings name but 
there was no repetition of the campus protest sunday night that 
attracted as many as 1000 students 
nothing will happen tonight one student said it would 
just be a repeat of last night and it would not be meaningful 
yesterday was the time for it to happen 
it was on the night of june 3 1989 that the peoples liberation 
army stormed beijing killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of 
people on the way to ending the occupation of tiananmen square by 
students pressing for reform 
beijing university students marched around campus sunday night 
singing the internationale the anthem of the international 
socialist movement which became a theme song during last years 
demonstrations 
the one speaker at the rally 21yearold economics major li 
minqi disappeared monday and was believed to be hiding 
several western journalists were roughed up and briefly detained 
by police during the protest the state department on monday 
denounced the action and said it had advised the chinese government 
that such actions are clearly unacceptable 
a few candles burned in some graduate dormitories monday night 
possibly in memory of those killed several people hooted and spat 
out a dormitory window when a convoy of security drove by 
the 100acre tiananmen square the symbolic center of china is 
usually open to the public but it was surrounded by paramilitary 
police 
a man who tried to hand out leaflets at the gate of the forbidden 
city across from the square was quickly seized by police foreign 
witnesses said western reporters saw police drag off another 
person apparently a woman near the square 
some students called for a hunger strike to mark the anniversary 
but it apparently did not take place some people said theyd get 
drunk one student said 
a hunger strike in may last year began the occupation of 
tiananmen square 
seven protesters outside the chinese embassy in paris held a 
36hour hunger strike that was to end monday night i decided to 
do something concrete for the anniversary so that we wont forget 
what happened and that political prisoners in china may be 
released said yvon thomas 19 who wore a headband with 
freedom and democracy written on it in chinese 
another gathering was held outside the chinese embassy in ulan 
bator the capital of mongolia which has recently undergone 
democratic changes after decades of communist rule 
twenty mongolian students staged a onehour sitin and tried to 
deliver a petition to the embassy but they were not allowed to the 
east german news agency adn said they left after pasting on the 
missions wall a poster condemning the june 4 bloodshed 
the official xinhua news agency reported late monday that beijing 
was stable and life was normal on the anniversary 
millions of beijing residents peacefully spent this monday in 
busy work and pleasant rest it said 
xinhua reported the sunday night protest but stressed that 
beijing campuses were in good order today and quiet as usual 
the government continues to insist that the military crackdown 
was justified saying it faced a counterrevolutionary plot to 
overthrow communist party rule 
the partys official peoples daily said in a frontpage 
editorial monday that the suppression of the democracy movement was 
absolutely correct and necessary 
it said that without resolute action against the demonstrators 
china would be in great chaos now

americans gave 1147 billion to charity in 1989 
a 1043 percent increase over 1988 according to a report released 
monday 
religious groups got the biggest chunk 5432 billion the 
aafrc trust for philanthropy said 
once again americans demonstrated the centrality of 
philanthropic giving not only to our culture but to our individual 
lives said the report 
the increase in giving actually was 55 percent when adjusted for 
inflation said the trust an arm of the american association of 
fundraising counsel 
the group was founded more than 50 years ago to advance 
philanthropy 
individual donations which amounted to 841 percent of the 
total increased 1167 percent over 1988 or 67 percent when 
adjusted for inflation they totaled 9643 billion 
for every 5 we spent on food we gave more than 80 cents 
almost 1 to a worthy cause said the report for every 2 we 
spent on shoes and clothing we gave 1 to philanthropy 
clearly these comparisons show that philanthropy is not 
ancillary to our lives not something we do on the side it said 
part of the generosity was attributed to an 89 percent rise in 
personal income the report also said a 211 percent stock market 
upswing in 1989 probably evoked bigger gifts from the affluent it 
also cited growing awareness of aids homelessness the environment 
and other concerns and intensified fundraising efforts 
two natural disasters in 1989 the san francisco earthquake and 
hurricane hugo generated an outpouring of financial aid the 
american red cross for example received 155 million for both 
disasters mostly from small individual donations 
in all 1989 contributions saw 67 billion from foundations up 
893 percent or 4 percent when adjusted for inflation 657 
billion from bequests the same overall but down 45 percent in 
inflationadjusted dollars and 5 billion for corporations up 417 
percent overall but down 05 percent over 1988 in 
inflationadjusted dollars 
overall 474 percent of the years donations or 5432 billion 
went to houses of worship religious organizations and the social 
services they provide that was up 1295 percent from 1988 or 74 
percent in inflationadjusted dollars 
catholic charities a coalition of 700 social service agencies 
joined a trend that has grown among secular groups it sponsored a 
credit card called caritas onehalf percent of each purchase 
price is earmarked as a donation 
in addition to religious groups donations were divided among 
human services 1139 billion up 858 percent or 37 percent 
when adjusted for inflation 
education 1069 billion up 449 percent or a slight drop 
when adjusted 
health 1004 billion up 48 percent or 01 percent when 
adjusted 
arts culture and humanities 749 billion up 1031 percent 
or 54 percent when adjusted 
public and society benefits including the environment traffic 
safety animal rights urban and rural development and countless 
other categories 362 billion up 1277 percent or 77 percent 
when adjusted 
all other uses including overseas services 1713 billion up 
108 percent or 59 percent when adjusted 
it was the fourth consecutive year that corporate giving did not 
keep pace with the rising costs faced by nonprofit organizations 
conversely the report said that japanese corporations showed a 
growing interest during 1989 in fostering their own philanthropic 
efforts in this country no figures were cited however 
a majority of the contributions from american corporations is 
earmarked for education now that money is increasingly benefiting 
children and alternative education programs rather than colleges 
in 1988 64 percent of all corporate education donations went to 
colleges and universities compared with about 70 percent in 1988 
in 1989 cocacola general electric ibm and rjr nabisco 
announced education grants that will total 130 million over the 
next decade they place heavy emphasis on elementary and secondary 
schooling and higher education for minorities

there was more drama offcamera than on at the 
1990 tony awards although the grapes of wrath was the upset 
winner for best play over the piano lesson 
the flap occurred during a commercial break at the televised 
award show when producer joseph cates blasted presenter ron silver 
for his lengthy defense of the embattled national endowment for the 
arts and for his remembrance of the massacre in beijing one year ago 
i support the nea cates explained to the black tie audience 
at the luntfontanne theater but added to take advantage of a 
live tv show like that does us all incredible harm this is not the 
show on which to make those comments 
cates comments were met with scattered boos and some applause by 
theatergoers 
if the piano lesson which had won the pulitzer prize and the 
new york drama critics circle award was sunday evenings biggest 
loser city of angels was the biggest winner it took home six 
awards including best musical the show also won for actormusical 
james naughton score cy coleman and david zippel book larry 
gelbart featured actressmusical randy graff set design robin 
wagner 
the grapes of wrath only won two honors including a 
directing award for frank galati but they were important prizes 
what counts in terms of box office is the best play award and the 
honor should help business at the stage adaptation of john 
steinbecks epic novel about depressionera okies until now the 
play has been doing respectable but not sellout business 
other highlights 
best speech tommy tunes second tony of the night a prize for 
his direction of grand hotel the lanky tune strode to the 
stage smiled waved at the audience and walked off he also picked 
up a tony for the shows choreography tune has won seven tonys

different categories actormusical featured actormusical

worst speech tyne dalys rambling thank you in which she kept 
reminding the audience that she only had 30 seconds in which to 
speak and then proceeded to ignore her own time limit for several 
minutes daly won the actressmusical award for her portrayal of 
mama rose in a revival of gypsy 
most emotional speech michael jeters tearful plea if you 
have got a problem with alcohol and drugs and you cant stop and 
think life cant change and dreams cant come true i stand here as 
living proof that you can stop he said in accepting the featured

time and dreams come true 
wittiest speech charles durning who picked up the supporting 
actor prize for his portrayal of big daddy in a revival of cat on

but i dont deserve arthritis either 
the evenings strangest omissions no mention during the 
telecast of rex harrison the debonair star of my fair lady who 
died at age 82 saturday one day before the tonys show and the 
closing of a chorus line didnt rate a footnote even though the 
final performance of broadways longest running show on april 28 was

prime minister yitzhak shamir on 
monday defended the right of soviet jews to live in israelioccupied 
territory saying a democracy could not limit where people live 
shamir was reacting to soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs 
comment sunday that he may limit soviet jewish emigration to israel 
if the immigrants settle on land seized from jordan and egypt 
speaking to israeli manufacturers in tel aviv the rightwing 
shamir said his governments policy is to allow jews to live 
anywhere in israel including the occupied west bank gaza strip and 
east jerusalem 
if the soviet union of president gorbachev does not consider 
itself empowered today to dictate to its citizens where to live 
its as clear as the sun that we educated by democracy and freedom 
cannot impose limitations on this or another category of settlers in 
the state of israel he said 
we shall not create ghettos and areas of residence in this 
country shamir added 
in the west bank settlement of ariel michael klimovitsky a 
recent arrival from leningrad supported shamirs statements 
israel is a free country its not the soviet union thank god 
in this country a man has to decide for himself where he will 
live the 25yearold computer programmer said 
ariel officials estimate that 200 soviet immigrants have moved to 
the settlement it is 10 miles southeast of nablus the west banks 
largest city and a focal point of the palestinian uprising against 
israeli rule 
shimon peres head of the centerleft labor party and shamirs 
strongest political rival said gorbachevs statement was a result 
of the governments failure to move toward a peace settlement with 
the palestinians 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
doubted the soviet president would carry out his threat 
were not sure what president gorbachev meant by his 
comments ms tutwiler said a day after the soviet leader ended 
his summit with president bush 
nothing that was said during the private summit discussions 
indicated in any way that the soviets wont live up to their 
commitments to permit soviet jewish emigration she said we 
expect that they will continue to do so they know how very 
important this is to us 
in all israeli officials said fewer than 300 of the 40000 
soviet jews who have arrived in israel this year have moved to the 
west bank and gaza this figure does not include an estimated 3200 
soviet immigrants living in annexed areas of jerusalem 
explaining his threat to limit immigration gorbachev said he was 
under intense pressure from arab nations which fear settlement of 
soviet jews on occupied land will displace palestinians currently 
17 million palestinians live in the west bank and gaza strip along 
with 70000 jewish settlers 
immigration is at an alltime high as a result of relaxed soviet 
restrictions and as many as 150000 soviet jews are expected to 
arrive by the end of the year about 1 million soviets are seeking 
permission to emigrate 
ariel is home to about 8000 jewish residents 
simcha dinitz head of the quasigovernmental jewish agency 
which helps immigrants said that since april 1989 some 285 soviet 
jews have moved to the occupied territories 
dinitzs figure on those living in the occupied lands excludes 
the soviets who have moved to a ring of jewish suburbs around arab 
east jerusalem on warwon land that israel annexed 
most western nations do not recognize israeli sovereignty over 
the area and earlier this year president bush said he viewed 
jerusalems jewish suburbs as part of the occupied areas 
neighborhood council officials in the suburbs that have taken the 
bulk of the soviet immigrants told the associated press at least 940 
soviet families or an estimated 3200 people have moved into the 
areas in the wave of immigration that began in spring 1989 
the four suburbs involved are pisgat zeev neve yaacov gilo and 
ramot 
foreign minister moshe arens said the future of soviet trade with 
the united states could hinge on the treatment of soviet jews and 
that this could determine whether gorbachev carries through on his 
threat 
the soviet union knows that the trade agreement it signed with 
the us is conditional on free emigration from the ussr and it 
is very hard to imagine that the process initiated by gorbachev in 
the soviet union with perestroika and free exit being integral 
parts of this process would undergo some change he said

east germany for now 
shevardnadze in copenhagen said that no quick agreement was 
likely and that the matter should eventually be taken to a broader 
meeting of european nations 
the us goal is to induce the soviets to drop their objections 
to nato membership for the new and stronger germany that will emerge 
when east germany is combined with west germany 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev registered his concerns 
about the soviets mighty neighbor and onetime deadly foe in his 
summit talks here with president bush 
they parted agreeing to disagree but with the soviet leader also 
saying he had surveyed some new possible perspectives with bush 
now baker intends to flesh them out with shevardnadze while they 
are attending a conference on human rights said us officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
baker also will confer in the danish capital with west german 
foreign minister hansdietrich genscher the innovative diplomat who 
originated many of the ideas 
the western plan includes a lowering of natos military profile 
as eastwest tensions subside and an acceleration of negotiations to 
ban shortrange nuclear weapons in both alliances 
also the officials said soviet troops could remain in what is 
now east german territory for some time the west germans would help 
gorbachev with his herculean program to pep up the soviet economy 
and the new germany would affirm its intention to acquire neither 
nuclear nor chemical weapons 
nato forces would not be deployed in the east german area the 
european security conference would be strengthened and nato and the 
warsaw pact would negotiate deeper cuts in troops and nonnuclear 
weapons once current reduction talks in vienna produce a treaty the 
officials told the associated press 
additionally baker said on sunday that the two alliances might 
exchange a political statement of assurances 
as baker was leaving washington shevardnadze was asked about the 
us plan in copenhagen 
i wouldnt say that we agreed with the americans on all 
things he said i couldnt say it an agreement will be 
possible already here we didnt pretend it is very difficult to 
find a solution on the external parts of the german unity 
shevardnadze said any accord over germanys military future 
should be presented to a paneuropean meeting and officials in 
copenhagen said the foreign ministers meeting will plan 
preparations for a november meeting of the conference on security 
and cooperation in europe 
in washington a us official said weve had the broad 
philosophical discussion at the summit a us official said 
our effort now is to try to engage them on the specifics 
basically the official said baker is approaching shevardnadze 
this way tell us what your concerns are and well try to find a way 
of meeting them 
but the official said the bush administration would not agree 
to discriminatory limitations on a unified germany 
after the copenhagen sessions baker and the 15 other nato 
foreign ministers including genscher will take up the difficult 
german problem again thursday at a meeting of the north atlantic 
council in turnberry scotland 
the human rights conference and the meeting of the western allies 
were already scheduled before bush and gorbachev held their fourday 
summit which ended sunday in washington 
but the bushgorbachev dispute over germanys military future 
gave bakers trip extra significance baker plans to meet with 
shevardnadze and genscher again in berlin later in the month 
well keep wrestling with it baker said sunday 
gorbachev for his part declared at the summit windup i 
cannot say that we have reached agreement but that does not mean 
that our efforts were futile many new arguments emerged as a result 
of these discussions and new possible perspectives 
we will continue our discussion in order to find a mutually 
acceptable solution gorbachev said 
gorbachev has repeatedly insisted that a unified germany not be 
aligned with nato he argues that in an era of democratic change 
his own people see the alliance as an antisoviet remnant of the 
cold war 
having lost more than 20 million people to nazi germany in world 
war ii and with the east european allies now a less reliable 
buffer gorbachev is anxious about being confronted by a stronger 
germany 
bush however at a joint news conference with the soviet leader 
said having germany in nato would be stabilizing

the lawmakers brian sedgemore and dale campbellsavours both

the british and chinese governments 
sedgemore said the two had planned to go sightseeing after an 
official visit to hong kong when they arrived at chinas border with 
macao a tiny portuguese colony 
to the astonishment of those traveling with us we were forced 
to leave our bus and were left stranded by the roadside on the 
border with macao he said this was despite the fact that we 
had been told that we were on a group visa 
he said the two believe they were stopped because chinese 
authorities believed they might become involved in protests of the

the future of the baltic republics will 
continue to be a thorny ussoviet issue despite a beneficial 
personal bond forged between president bush and mikhail gorbachev 
former president gerald ford said monday 
i believe a personal relationship that is based on good faith 
understanding and kindliness makes a major difference in trying to 
resolve some of these international problems ford told the 
national press club 
its my judgment that president bush and mr gorbachev have 
established that kind of rapport and it would be my estimate that 
it will pay dividends and benefits in the months ahead he said in 
a questionandanswer session with club members and guests 
ford also was asked whether he believed the soviet economic 
embargo of lithuania in retaliation for its march 11 declaration of 
independence would continue to be an obstacle to a us grant of 
most favored nation trading status to the soviet union 
the problem of the baltic nations estonia and latvia and 
lithuania is going to be a very difficult one for mr gorbachev to 
solve and it will be a continuing problem between the government of 
the united states and the soviet union he said 
bush announced during the superpower summit that ended sunday in 
washington that he would grant most favored nation status to the 
soviet union if moscow drops restrictions on emigration 
but bush made no mention of lithuania the agreement is subject 
to approval by congress 
the united states has never recognized the incorporation of the 
baltic states into the soviet union after the hitlerstalin pact 
during world war ii 
our position today has to be consistent with that point of 
view and that of course is not reconcilable with mr gorbachevs 
problems ford said 
the former president said he believed the united states should be 
somewhat understanding of what mr gorbachev faces and how he can 
handle it and give him time in a reasonable sense to seek a 
solution 
as to the trade proposal ford said the congress very likely 
will try to roadblock it whether they can or not whether the votes 
are there i am not in a position to assess that at the moment 
ford spoke after presenting the annual 5000 gerald r ford 
journalism awards sponsored by the gerald r ford foundation 
gerald seib of the wall street journal received the award for 
reporting on the presidency and debra polsky of defense news was 
recognized for reporting about defense issues

despite reforms that have won mikhail s gorbachev 
praise and admiration in the west human rights abuses still abound 
in the soviet union a monitoring group said monday 
freedom of religion the press and emigration remain restricted 
there are as many as 188 alleged political prisoners and refugees 
from ethnic strife in various soviet republics are forced to live in 
miserable conditions according to the international helsinki 
federation for human rights 
the group meeting in moscow for the first time in its eightyear 
history said it encountered no harassment or intimidation during 
two days of hearings 
but its chairman karl j von schwarzenberg said it was denied 
access to a psychiatric institute after insisting upon bringing 
along soviet human rights activists who were members of the 
federation 
they declined to see us telling us our russian members are 
insane von schwarzenberg said which was a remarkable 
statement i must say 
the federation will present its formal report on human rights in 
the soviet union at a meeting of the 35nation conference on 
security and cooperation in europe that opens tuesday in copenhagen 
the meeting is an outgrowth of the 1975 helsinki final act 
moscow will be the host next year for another such gathering and 
the federations members viewed the weekend meetings as a test to 
see whether it was possible to meet and talk about human rights in 
the soviet union 
we are not satisfied with the conditions as they exist now 
said david matas a chairman of the canadian helsinki committee 
when asked about the prospects for a successful 1991 meeting in 
moscow 
but nikolai uspensky of the soviet foreign ministry told a 
separate news conference monday that there is no opposition to 
holding this meeting in moscow 
at the same time i must say that at the very beginning 
americans and the british were cool and reluctant to hold such a 
meeting in moscow because they were afraid they would be unable to 
maintain the standard of such a conference uspensky said well 
they have no doubts now 
irwin cotler a law professor at mcgill university in montreal 
and a chairman of the canadian committee illustrated how far the 
soviet union had come by noting that longtime dissident lev 
timofeyev presided at mondays news conference for the helsinki 
federation at a human rights meeting in 1988 timofeyev was not 
allowed to speak 
the federation said the human rights abuses that exist today are 
left over from the days before gorbachevs reforms but added the 
abuses nonetheless remain at such a high level to be a cause for 
great concern 
the federation noted there are between 50 and 188 identified 
cases of alleged political prisoners and noted the case of mikhail 
kazachkov of leningrad who was arrested in 1975 on charges of 
treason after applying to emigrate 
cotler said kazachkov has been denied the right to counsel has 
been allowed only three visits from his 88yearold mother in 14 
years and has spent five years in solitary confinement kazachkov 
has been given such harsh treatment he said because he has stood 
up for the rights of political prisoners and because he is a jew 
while people are no longer imprisoned for antisoviet 
propaganda alone they are convicted of crimes of hooliganism for 
apparent political activities the federation said 
it also said there was concern about continued detention through 
abuse of psychiatry 
turning to the press the federation said independent newspapers 
cannot buy newsprint use printing presses or distribute via kiosks 
and have had their offices burglarized and ransacked 
it noted what it called severe restrictions on freedom of 
religion saying the leadership of the russian orthodox church is 
in effect appointed by the communist government it also said the 
state has taken property from the ukrainian catholic church which 
was banned by stalin and that there is no legal way to return it

a letter from tennessee officials 
suggesting that maines taxation bureau may be subject to a new 
tennessee tax touched off a tongueincheek debate over taxes and 
tourism 
the form letter from the tennessee revenue department was 
accompanied by a summary of the law imposing the tax on outofstate 
financial institutions that do business in tennessee lawmakers 
there enacted the measure this year 
financial institutions which you represent or with which you 
are associated in some way may be subject to taxation under the 
act reads the letter received by the maine taxation bureau last 
month 
maine state tax assessor john d lafaver realized that the tax 
bureau itself could not be taxed by another state but the 
temptation to respond to tennessee revenue commissioner joe 
huddleston proved irresistible 
if you have found a way to tax other states revenue 
departments i would like to know what the secret is lafaver 
wrote he noted that maine and other new england states were forced 
to pare spending substantially this year because of an unanticipated 
economic slump 
maybe we could claim that any state whose residents eat maine 
lobsters or consume our famous potatoes or enjoy our unsurpassed 
scenery and hospitality would have their taxation departments 
contribute their fair share to supporting the state that makes all 
that possible 
huddleston said monday the letter was sent to maine officials to 
inform them about the law it was not necessarily asking the maine 
department to register to pay the tax he said in a telephone 
interview from nashville 
huddleston took goodnatured issue with lafavers assertion that 
maines scenery is unsurpassed saying he was more than willing to 
put our scenery up against maines

spiraling health care costs labor and 
managements biggest sticking point in collective bargaining are 
forcing companies nationwide to take extraordinary steps such as 
setting up their own medical clinics or physician networks 
goodyear tire amp rubber co for instance has three medical 
clinics at plants in oklahoma ohio and alabama where workers can 
visit a physician eye doctor or pharmacist for 15 followup 
visits are 5 
there are two ways to go decrease benefits and jack up 
premiums for workers or find a better and cheaper way says 
consultant victor williams 
more than a dozen fortune 500 companies have called williams in 
the past year inquiring about goodyears experience in the medical 
business he said 
goodyear estimates it saves 1 million a year on its 163 million 
health care bill it just scratches the surface but it helps 
said spokesman bob mercer 
employees benefit as well said jr countryman of the united 
rubber workers which represents goodyear workers in alabama it 
sure has cut down on our costs he said 
but not all management efforts to trim health care costs are 
being embraced by workers 
in fact union workers nationwide increasingly find themselves 
trying to fend off management efforts to shift health care costs to 
workers the issue was at the heart of 78 percent of the strikes 
waged last year by unions according to one study 
most recently a twoyear battle to resolve health care costs in 
the railroad industry proved unsuccessful last month president 
bush was forced to appoint an emergency board to try and prevent a 
strike 
in that dispute the major railroads which for decades have 
provided workers with a solid lowcost health care package wanted 
the 235000 brakemen engineers and other workers who keep the 
nations freight system moving to pay higher deductibles and make 
payroll contributions 
then they have to think twice because its not something 
someone else is going to pay for 100 percent said charles 
hopkins chairman of the national railway labor conference which 
represents management in the dispute 
union officials contend shifting health care costs to workers 
does little to solve a greater problem that merits congress 
attention how to rein in runaway medical costs 
to try to pin the blame on some poor worker worried about their 
kid in the middle of the night is really outrageous said bob 
master of the communications workers of america which fought a 
health care battle for telephone workers in the northeast last year 
hopkins said management has no choice but to try to shift part of 
the burden to workers because we are being consumed by the cost of 
our socalled fringe benefits 
besides trying to shift premium costs to workers companies are 
also moving to restrict a workers right to choose a doctor some 
also are auditing patients bills 
many companies are now setting up preferred provider 
arrangements medical networks that provide services to workers at 
a negotiated price often employers provide financial incentives 
for workers to use the ppo rather than their own family doctor 
other companies such as florida power amp light are hiring nurses 
to visit hospitals to audit patients bills to make sure money isnt 
being wasted the effort said spokesman michael millhorn is an 
attempt to save money without hurting workers 
we dont want to mess with the level of benefits if we can 
avoid it millhorn said 
paul oneill chairman of alcoa the aluminum company of america 
told a house panel recently that he didnt feel comfortable 
intervening in workers medical care decisions 
oneill noted that employers do not have a say in what type of 
car or food a worker buys 
yet here i am in the middle of personal medical care he said 
union leaders who have long been pushing for some type of 
national health care system hope the problems will lead business to 
join them in supporting health care reform rather than merely 
trying to pass costs on to workers 
thats simply a blamethevictim strategy that may look good in 
the short term and for the balance sheet but what we should be 
saying is hey lets try to get a permanent solution to this 
problem said karen ignagni the aflcios expert on health care 
according to a study by the service employees international 
union workers outofpocket expenses for health care grew faster 
than wages from 1986 to 1989 
the biggest increase was in employee contributions to premiums 
for family health coverage which rose from 1430 to 2412 if 
current trends continue the study found health insurance premiums 
will consume 27 percent of takehome pay by 1998 
its a national problem and must be addressed nationally 
aflcio president lane kirkland said recently 
ignagni and other union leaders said government involvement is 
crucial because theres a limit to how creative labor and management 
can be at reducing health care costs for instance she said little 
can be done at the bargaining table to bring down the cost of a 900 
hospital room 
the lesson of the 90s is that there is a limit to what you can 
do to change the slope of the curve she said

the supreme court on monday barred connecticut 
officials from pressing drunkendriving charges against a man 
acquitted of manslaughter in a fatal traffic accident 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the second 
prosecution would violate the motorists doublejeopardy 
constitutional rights 
the justices ruled in a similar case may 29 by a 54 vote they 
said a new york man who pleaded guilty to drunken driving and 
related traffic offenses in a fatal car crash may not be prosecuted 
later for homicide and assault 
in the case acted on monday john lonergan was driving a car in 
hartford on may 22 1985 when he collided with a motorcycle driven 
by scott sementilli 
sementilli died the next day from his injuries 
longeran was charged with manslaughter and driving while 
intoxicated and the state decided to try him only on the 
manslaughter count a judge ruled that the state had failed to prove 
beyond a reasonable doubt that lonergans alleged intoxication 
caused sementillis death and ordered lonergan acquitted 
state prosecutors then sought to try lonergan for driving under 
the influence of liquor but a judge threw out the prosecution that 
ruling was upheld by the connecticut supreme court last year 
the state court said retrying lonergan would violate the 
constitutions ban on multiple prosecutions for the same crime 
the record clearly indicates that in the second prosecution for 
operating while under the influence the state will rely on and seek 
to prove the same act of operating while intoxicated that was 
necessary to prove the manslaughter charge in the first 
prosecution the state court said 
the case is connecticut vs lonergan 891295

jury selection began monday in mayor marion 
barrys drug and perjury trial as barry accused prosecutors of 
pursuing him with the tactics of a totalitarian kind of society 
the mayor accompanied by his wife effi went to the us 
courthouse as the first of two groups of 125 potential jurors filled 
out questionnaires designed to uncover any bias for or against him 
two of barrys security guards and several businessmen who have 
benefited from city city contracts are among those included on a 
list of potential witnesses according to the questionnaires the 
trial is expected to last about a month 
barry 54 has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of cocaine 
possession three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of 
conspiracy the three charges of lying are felonies 
sources close to the case have said barrys lawyers have been 
conducting plea bargain talks with federal prosecutors but one 
source said the two sides are at an impasse 
us attorney jay stephens wants the mayor to plead to a 
felony but thats not likely to happen said a city official who 
spoke only on condition of anonymity barry is willing to consider 
pleading guilty only to misdemeanors the official said 
if barry were jailed on a felony conviction or guilty plea he 
would be barred from holding office or running for reelection to a 
fourth fouryear term this november 
since 1983 my family have had to go through my mail being 
opened my bank accounts checked my tax return looked at my phones 
tapped barry said in an interview with radio station wol 
you cant even have a conference in your bedroom with your wife 
for fear that theyre listening to anything you may say he added 
its been a thing that you thought may happen in a totalitarian 
kind of society 
the mayor also said a local television station had obtained from 
prosecutors a copy of the fbi videotape that sources close to the 
case say shows barry smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room jan 18 
theyre trying to figure out now how to show it he said 
judy smith spokeswoman for us attorney stephens said 
prosecutors would not comment on that the station wrctv also 
said it would have no comment 
on the list of 48 names of possible witnesses were charles lewis 
and rasheeda moore as well as barry security guards james stays and 
fred gaskins 
lewis in a plea agreement involving drug charges against 
himself testified last november that he supplied barry with crack 
cocaine moore a former model persuaded barry to come to the hotel 
room where he was arrested 
the questionnaires ask whether potential jurors think lying while 
under oath is justifiable 
barry has acknowledged he suffers from alcoholism and the 
potential panelists were asked whether they think that could be used 
to excuse criminal activity 
the questionaire also included a section asking the respondents 
to give their feelings about undercover sting operations the method 
used to produce barrys arrest in addition they were asked whether 
they thought the case agains the mayor was racially or politically 
motivated 
barry supporters and opponents gathered outside the courthouse as 
efforts began to select 12 jurors and six alternates 
two dozen guardian angels a selfstyled anticrime group 
carried signs demanding barrys resignation they were taunted by 
several barry supporters who said the black mayor was the victim of 
racially motivated prosecution and had been entrapped by 
investigators 
if anyone should be on trial it should be us attorney 
stephens said florence smith of the national welfare rights 
organization 
barry attended a church rally sunday night and called the months 
since his jan 18 arrest the most difficult time in my life 
i aint gonna waste time barry said ive come too far 
from where i started from after a standing ovation from the 
crowd he expressed confidence that his legal crisis will not bring 
him down 
while barry has said he needs only one juror to vote against 
convicting him some of his top aides and political advisers have 
indicated they are extremely reluctant to see the case come to trial

that allows prayer groups in public schools

in an 81 decision the high court ruled that student prayer 
groups must be allowed to meet at public schools that permit other

nelson mandela began a world tour 
monday to urge countries not to drop sanctions against south africa 
even though the countrys whitedominated government has abandoned 
some racist policies 
apartheid is still alive the african national congress 
leader told an overflow crowd of 25000 people who took the 
afternoon off to hear him speak in the gabarone national stadium 
mandelas 13nation sixweek trip which includes stops in the 
united states follows a tour last month by south african president 
fw de klerk 
during the trip de klerk said he expected european leaders to 
reduce or end some economic social and diplomatic sanctions against 
south africa in response to the reforms his government is carrying 
out 
but mandela whose anc is the main black group working to end 
white rule said to stop sanctions now would be a stab in the 
back 
also monday officials at the united nations said 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar will send a team of senior 
un officials to south africa on saturday for 10 days to discuss 
ending apartheid 
the team will meet members of the south african government 
representatives of political parties movements and other 
organizations on the latest developments concerning apartheid a 
statement said 
mandela said he intends to give leaders in africa europe and 
north america the correct picture of what is happening in south 
africa he said that despite relaxation of restrictions on political 
activity and repeal of some apartheid laws the main issue of black 
voting rights and selfdetermination has not been addressed 
under apartheid the black majority has no vote 
while mandela is trying to persuade world leaders to keep up the 
pressure on the south african government de klerk is expected to be 
making dramatic changes at home 
the government has already announced that later this month it 
expects parliament to pass a bill repealing the separate amenities 
act which allows the segregation of public facilities such as 
parks libraries and restrooms 
sometime this week many observers and newspapers have predicted 
de klerk will either lift the 4yearold national state of emergency 
or repeal most of it ending the state of emergency has been one of 
the main conditions the african national congress has set as a 
prerequisite for the lifting of sanctions and for formal 
constitutional negotiations with the government 
if the state of emergency is lifted that will be a victory for 
us mandela told reporters as he boarded a 12seat twinengine 
botswana government plane in johannesburg 
we have been demanding the lifting of the state of emergency 
which has been identified by us as an obstacle to negotiations the 
lifting was part of the agreement reached during our may 24 talks 
with the government he said 
mandela told the gabarone rally that sanctions and the ancs 
armed struggle would end when fundamental and irreversible changes 
occur in south africa

warm reunion today with former president ronald reagan then told an 
enthuasiastic audience at stanford university the cold war is now 
behind us let us not wrangle over who won it 
the reunion in a midmorning coffee klatch with their wives gave 
gorbachev an opportunity to enlist reagans help in winning 
conservative support for arms and trade pacts signed last week by 
president bush 
for reagan gorbachevs partner in breaking the cold war ice in 
five summits the meeting marked one of his few moments back in the 
limelight since leaving office last year 
the two men met at the home of the soviet consul general where 
the gorbachevs slept after flying in late sunday from 
minneapolisst paul and spent a few minutes at the start gazing at 
a view of the golden gate bridge 
reagan said he and gorbachev discussed the independence drive of 
the baltic states and other issues during their 40 minutes together 
we discussed the obstacles that must be overcome reagan said 
as he left holding a medal gorbachev gave him for the american 
people in thanks for their help following the armenian earthquake 
reagan declined to discuss specifics of their talk or comment on 
the summit between gorbachev and bush 
gorbachev who told us officials he was tired and delayed the 
start of the reagan breakfast 45 minutes left immediately afterward 
for a speech at stanford university south of san francisco 
gorbachevs 50car motorcade reached stanford shortly before 
noon about an hour behind schedule he was greeted by former 
secretary of state george shultz university president donald 
kennedy and sens alan cranston and pete wilson of california 
thousands of students cheering gorby gorby welcomed the 
soviet leader as he walked through the inner quad of the scenic 
campus gorbachev waded into the crowd shaking hands with the 
students and smiling 
greeted by a standing ovation as he began his speech gorbachev 
drew more cheers when he told his audience the cold war is now 
behind us let us not wrangle over who won it 
let us think about the future he said our two countries 
have more than enough reasons to be partners in building it 
also left in his schedule were lunch with 150 captains of 
industry in oil banking food entertainment airlines hotels 
real estate and computers and a meeting with the south korean 
president the soviet president heads home from san francisco late 
today wrapping up a sevenday north american visit 
former first lady nancy reagan bristled at a question suggesting 
she and raisa gorbachev once had a cool relationship i think 
theres been a great misunderstanding about our relationship she 
said 
shortly before the meeting about 25 demonstrators hoisted five 
lithuanian flags and banners reading freedom for lithuania and 
honk for freedom at the south end of the golden gate bridge a 
blueandgold biplane flew above the residence hauling a banner 
calling for freedom for armenia 
gorbachevs trip already has yielded two dividends pacts with 
chevron corp and ibm corp 
at a meeting with business leaders sunday in minnesota gorbachev 
called for more ussoviet joint ventures and warned that 
executives who just stand on the sidelines who do not want to 
risk will remain on the sidelines when the soviet economy is 
prospering well make sure that is so he said 
the gorbachevs were welcomed to california by gov george 
deukmejian who presented him with a letter from the states 
armenian community conveying hopes for the future of the soviet 
republic of armenia where activists are seeking greater autonomy 
from central authority 
the governor who is among 350000 californians of armenian 
descent many armenians have been killed in ethnic and political 
strife in the southern ussr 
after the speech at stanford gorbachev was to return to the city 
to pitch perestroika and opportunities for ussoviet joint 
ventures to the banquet of billionaires and millionaires 
trade also was expected to dominate gorbachevs lateafternoon 
summit with south korean president roh taewoo the first meeting 
between leaders of the two countries since the korean peninsula was 
partitioned their talks were expected to help pave the way for an 
easing of tensions on the peninsula 
on sunday gorbachev stopped for seven hours in minneapolis 
wooing street crowds and business leaders and calling for help with 
his countrys radical reforms 
when we begin such a project we feel we need american business 
because it is so big he said at an evening meeting attended by 
such corporate luminaries as the leaders of amoco corp kellogg 
co unisys corp and general mills 
in summit discussions last week in washington bush and gorbachev 
agreed to a trade deal that was the result of classic 
washingtonstyle horse trading in which gorbachev proved himself as 
skillful a dealmaker as bush 
bush agreed to give the soviets full normal trade rights 
receiving in return an implicit timetable to put liberal emigration 
policies into soviet law 
the trade pact faces an uncertain future in congress where many 
insist it will not gain approval unless gorbachev eases economic 
pressure against lithuania but minnesota gov rudy perpich said 
today that gorbachev won some allies in his meeting with business 
leaders sunday 
there was a very clear message that the business community 
really are going to put pressure on washington that the soviet 
union be granted mostfavorednation status perpich said on cbs 
this morning 
in addition to being a necessary first step toward drastically 
cutting tariffs on soviet goods sold in the united states the trade 
agreement would expand opportunities for us companies in the 
soviet union by reducing red tape and providing greater protections 
against copyright piracy 
gorbachev is perhaps more popular in the west than he is at home 
where his people face bare store shelves in a failing economy 
he made a point before leaving washington of touting agreements 
signed with chevron and international business machines saying they 
provided a solid pillar of support for a new era of superpower 
cooperation 
both the chevron and ibm agreements were examples of commercial 
contacts that would be facilitated by the trade agreement signed by 
bush and gorbachev 
the agreement the soviets signed with chevron on saturday would 
grant the san franciscobased oil company exploration rights for 
development of the soviet unions largest newly discovered oil 
field an 8900squaremile region near the caspian sea 
the other agreement was for ibm to sell 13000 personal computers 
for use in soviet schools stock analysts said the deal could be 
worth around 25 million to ibm

supporters of mayor marion barry said monday 
outside the courtroom that prosecuting him on drug and perjury 
charges is an unwarranted invasion of his personal life 
what he did he did to himself we all have some skeletons 
in our closet said retiree lavergne marshall who came to the 
us courthouse in a show of support for the mayor his case began 
with 250 prospective jurors filling out questionnaires 
if the case concerned misappropriation of funds or some crime 
against the city it would be a different thing altogether and 
she would favor aggressive prosecution mrs marshall said 
some barry supporters taunted two dozen members of the guardian 
angels a selfstyled anticrime group which demonstrated outside 
the courthouse 
barry smoked crack we dont want him back said a sign 
carried by one redbereted member 
the man himself is doing drugs and should step down because 
he is an important role model for young people in the district of 
columbia said unique king a regional coordinator for the angels 
the focal point of the governments case is an fbi videotape that 
sources close to the case say shows barry smoking crack cocaine in a 
hotel room where an exmodel rasheeda moore had persuaded him to 
come 
when i think of the entrapment used by the government to 
bring him to his knees i think that is wrong said mrs marshall 
the process of bringing barry to trial on 14 criminal charges is 
racist at its very heart said chukwuma onyeije 24 a medical 
student at howard university 
i think its a very racist act just because of who he is 
dwight terrell a washington resident said in front of the 
courthouse 
the barry prosecution is part of a conspiracy against black 
political leaders said donald coble also of washington

lithuanias president said monday he hoped soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev would soften his stance toward the 
breakaway baltic republic after returning from the superpower summit 
but lithuanian president vytautas landsbergis added in an 
interview with the voice of america radio station that he did not 
hear any encouraging words from gorbachev during four days of talks 
in washington with president bush 
the worst would have been if mikhail gorbachev came out with 
the impression that everything he is doing visavis lithuania is 
permitted landsbergis said in the interview a transcript of 
which was provided in english to the associated press 
he charged gorbachev with using propaganda methods toward 
lithuania which declared independence march 11 gorbachev has 
ordered an economic embargo of fuel and many other supplies on the 
republic of 38 million residents 
soviet media reported monday that moscow authorities were 
enforcing the embargo even on supplies lithuania bought abroad 
soviet border guards turned away trucks carrying sorely needed 
gasoline from poland late friday said the interfax news agency 
which is affiliated with state radio moscow 
it said the lithuanian government had bought about 11 million 
gallons of gasoline from poland for hard currency but couldnt get 
the shipmet across the sovietcontrolled border 
the independent estonian news service reported a similar 
incident it said a train carrying gas obtained through bartering 
with poland was idled monday in the neutral zone between the two 
borders and it was unclear whether border guards or customs 
authorities were holding it 
gorbachev has demanded lithuania revoke its declaration before 
the blockade can be lifted and negotiations begun over secession on 
the basis of the soviet constitution 
but landsbergis on monday reiterated lithuanias refusal to 
reverse its declaration saying i dont think well ever be able 
to take this step according to governmentrun voa 
at the summit bush and gorbachev agreed to a trade pact that 
bush said is conditioned only on moscows approval of liberalized 
emigration laws bush had been saying moscow also must end its 
blockade against lithuania but he changed that position sunday 
kazimiera prunskiene lithuanias prime minister who met with 
bush and gorbachev separately in the past weeks said she believed 
gorbachev would modify his position on lithuania after returning 
home 
its one thing to talk tough in americas forums and to disply 
this firm position by the ussr and gorbachev himself but it is 
another thing to understand that the us congress as well as the 
situation in the soviet union are unfavorable to his rigid 
position she told voa 
congress must still approve the trade pact and some us 
lawmakers have said they would not allow the soviet union to become 
a mostfavorednation trading partner until gorbachev ends his 
economic squeeze on lithuania 
the mostfavorednation designation qualifies a trading partner 
for the lowest us tariffs

the supreme court assured police monday they 
may continue using jailhouse undercover agents ruling that such 
agents may trick suspects into confessing without first warning them 
of their rights 
by an 81 vote the justices said jailed criminal suspects need 
not receive socalled miranda warnings about their right to remain 
silent and get a lawyers help before being questioned by undercover 
agents 
in its famous 1966 ruling the court ruled that police must give 
such warnings before interrogating suspects who are in custody 
but writing for the court in an illinois case monday justice 
anthony m kennedy said miranda warnings are not required when 
the suspect is unaware that he is speaking to a law enforcement 
officer and gives a voluntary statement 
kennedy added 
conversations between suspects and undercover agents do not 
implicate the concerns underlying miranda the essential ingredients 
of a policedominated atmosphere and compulsion are not present when 
an incarcerated person speaks freely to someone that he believes to 
be a fellow inmate 
justice thurgood marshall the lone dissenter said the ruling 
may well result in a proliferation of departmental policies to 
encourage police officers to conduct interrogations of confined 
suspects through undercover agents 
the decisions impact is confined to jailed suspects not yet 
charged with the crime about which they are questioned the court in 
1980 ruled that law enforcement officials cannot hire jailhouse 
informants to elicit confessions from those already charged with a 
crime or those who have invoked their right to a lawyers help 
mondays ruling is a defeat for lloyd perkins who unwittingly 
made incriminating remarks about a murder to an undercover agent at 
a hillsboro ill jail 
perkins later was charged with fatally shooting richard 
stephenson on nov 8 1984 in fairview heights ill 
miranda was not meant to protect suspects from boasting about 
their criminal activities in front of persons whom they believe to 
be their cellmates kennedy wrote for the high court adding that 
perkins spoke at his own peril 
the decision reversed an illinois appeals court ruling that the 
statements perkins made to parisi could not be used as trial 
evidence

middleclass black women with college educations 
are twice as likely to bear lowbirthweight babies as whites of the 
same income and education a study found 
the study of more than 100000 births in chicago suggests that 
the effects of poverty linger for generations the researchers said 
monday 
low birth weight is the most important predictor of whether 
babies will die said the lead researcher dr james w collins jr 
who specializes in newborns at childrens memorial hospital 
the united states which ranks 22nd among developed countries in 
infant survival is losing its fight to reduce the infant mortality 
rate collins said 
he and a colleague dr richard j david of cook county hospital 
examined 103072 birth records about half of them for whites and 
half for blacks for the years 1982 and 1983 
they found that lowbirthweight babies those less than 5 
pounds were born to blacks at twice the rate they were to whites 
at virtually every income and educational level 
in households earning less than 10000 a year 15 percent of the 
black babies were of low birth weight compared with 8 percent for 
whites 
in households earning 30000 to 40000 a year the rate was 10 
percent for blacks and 5 percent for whites 
among mothers with less than a high school education the rate 
was 16 percent for blacks and 7 percent for whites and for mothers 
with a college ecucation the rate was 10 percent for blacks and 5 
percent for whites 
if youre middle class and black despite having education 
being of optimal age to have children and living in a 20000 to 
30000ayear household you still do twice as bad as whites 
similar to you collins said 
the study appears in the june issue of the american journal of 
public health where the two researchers write we suspect that 
the persistently high rate of low birth weight infants among blacks 
reflects generations of poverty 
the researchers added they also suspect that it may require 
more than one generation of nonpoverty and adequate services to see 
an impact upon infant birth weight 
the researchers didnt examine specific factors that might have 
caused the differences but collins said he believed nutrition 
during adolescence may be key 
i think psychosocial stress is also a factor but its very 
hard to measure said collins another may be that fewer blacks 
than whites seek prenatal care even when both can afford it he 
said 
he cited a study published in november 1988 about 31000 largely 
middleclass women in a california health maintenance organization 
it found that prenatal care could narrow the gap between rates of 
lowbirthweight babies between blacks and whites but that blacks 
sought such care less often 
i dont know how much racism comes into it collins said 
speculating that some blacks may have had so many bad experiences 
with medical institutions that they tend to avoid them 
dr kwangsun lee a university of chicago professor of 
pediatrics and obstetricsgynecology said he believed none of the 
factors that has been studied such as improved prenatal care 
reduced teenage pregnancy or improved nutrition would eliminate 
the discrepancies improvement in all those areas might help said 
lee who wasnt involved with the study 
the study which has not been clearly done is what is the effect 
of a stressful life situation he said when women in low social 
classes have repeated stressful events what happens to the womb has 
not been defined yet 
american indians have normalweight babies as often as whites 
even though they are poorer than whites or blacks lee said 
suggesting that none of the effects of poverty usually blamed for 
lowbirthweight babies appears to be affecting them 
lee and collins noted that british researchers showed as long as 
20 years ago that the rate of low birth weights didnt decline until 
the second generation after a woman attained more affluence 
it is more important how you are brought up than whether you 
marry a millionaire lee said

us trade representative carla hills on monday 
sought latin american support for a us effort to eliminate 
barriers to agricultural trade 
she said that latin america had a major stake in the outcome of 
the current global trade talks due to conclude at the end of this 
year because of the dependence of many nations in the region on 
farm exports 
the united states is pushing a proposal that would eliminate all 
tradedistorting agricultural subsidies over the next 10 years 
however the 12nation european community is leading a fight to 
preserve farm subsidies because of its network of small farms 
in a speech to organization of american states meeting in 
paraguay hills said the european community was refusing to budge in 
its opposition and she appealed for support from latin america 
if by working together we can cause our reform proposal to 
prevail the developing world will no longer have to compete against 
the treasuries of the developed world she said in remarks 
released in washington we should put an end to the astronomic 
export subsidies by which governments bribe the marketplace 
unless there is movement on the contentious issue of farm 
subsidies many fear that the fouryear round of trade 
liberalization talks being held under the auspices of the 96nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade will end in failure 
hills was unable to make progress on the farm issue during 
meetings in paris last week with ec officials she said the 
administration still viewed reform of agricultural subsidies as 
critical for achieving a successful package of new trading rules 
hills hailed the dramatic economic and political changes 
occurring in such countries as paraguay argentina brazil bolivia 
chile costa rica and mexico she said that the bush administration 
stood ready to forge a new partnership to promote economic growth 
she said the united states had a major stake in what occurs in 
latin america because nearly 60 percent of total us direct foreign 
investment was concentrated in the region central and south america 
also represented a huge market for us exports she said 
the lost decade of the 1980s was not only your tragedy but 
also ours she said it is estimated that us exporters lost as 
much as 130 billion in possible sales in the region from 1982 to 
1988 it wasnt until 1988 that our exports climbed back to their 
1981 level 
she said the partnership she was proposing with the united states 
would involve negotiating commercial agreements to liberalize trade 
and investment and working to promote a hemispheric zone of open 
trade 
the united states is in the process of removing all trade 
barriers with canada and there are preliminary discussions 
concerning a possible free trade zone with mexico as well

the vermont supreme court upheld a 
sixmonth state moratorium on civil jury trials such as divorces and 
said the budgetcutting measure didnt interfere with the right to a 
speedy trial 
the moratorium intended to save 75000 to help the state avoid 
a deficit did not affect criminal trials 
the constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial must be considered 
in context the court said adding that speedy need not be instant 
the ban only affected civil cases which usually involve 
divorces property disputes personal injury claims malpractice 
suits and breaches of contract it could be overriden in specific 
cases by the administrative trial judge 
the moratorium which will expire july 1 was imposed by the 
court in january as a way to cope with budget cuts prompted by the 
states sagging economy the court was ordered to reduce its budget 
by about 300000 
the 220member vermont trial lawyers association filed a 
classaction lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban it said that the 
federal and state constitutions guarantee the right to a speedy 
trial 
however the court said its action was constitutional and a 
prudent way to manage caseloads and resources 
our precedents do not support the absolutist view of the jury 
trial right that the petitioners espouse said the decision 
written by retired chief justice albert barney 
even with the moratorium barney noted most cases will come to 
trial faster than in past years 
the petitioners remedy of instant access to a jury cannot be 
found in the constitutional jury trial rights on which they rely 
caseloads cannot be managed on the simplistic position that everyone 
is entitled to an immediate trial whenever they are ready for one 
barney wrote 
the vermont supreme court decision is counter to a federal court 
ruling in california that held civil jury trials in us district 
court could not be suspended because of fiscal restraints 
but the vermont justices said the federal ruling centered around 
the length of the moratorium not the moratorium itself the 
justices said the vermont moratorium delayed civil jury trials for 
only a relatively short period of time 
the trial lawyers association had sought to disqualify the 
entire fivemember supreme court from the case arguing that the 
justices issued the moratorium and therefored had a conflict of 
interest 
the court disagreed but two members disqualified themselves 
because of personal relationships with some of the law firms 
involved in the challenge 
barney and another retired justice took their places on the court

prime minister yitzhak shamir said monday he 
will have a majority in parliament to form a rightwing coalition 
government and that he expects to swear in the new cabinet next week 
shamir 74 head of the likud bloc said he expected 61 to 65 
members in the 120seat knesset or parliament to approve the 
coalition 
if his prediction proves accurate shamir would be sworn in next 
week as premier for the fourth time since 1983 
shamirs aide yossi ahimeir said the new cabinet would maintain 
israels commitment to usbacked peace proposals despite expected 
opposition from ultranationalist coalition partners 
shamir has spent the past 39 days trying to forge a new alliance 
with smaller religious and rightwing parties it would replace the 
national unity government with the centerleft labor party which 
was toppled march 15 by a vote of no confidence in parliament 
asked when he would submit his new government for parliament 
approval shamir told reporters i cannot give you a precise date 
but it will certainly be early next week 
a labor official close to labor party leader shimon peres said he 
believed there was an 80 percent chance shamir would succeed in 
forming a narrow government 
but he said since shamirs hopes hinged on a single vote 
anything could still happen as it did in april when peres lost a 
bid to form a laborled government after a member of a religious 
faction in parliament defected at the last moment 
shamir was expected to delay formal announcement until he irons 
out details of his agreements with other factions ahimeir said in a 
telephone interview 
he faces a deadline of midnight thursday when the mandate given 
to him by president chaim herzog expires 
ahimeir said some points with smaller parties were still 
pending negotiation and declined to elaborate there is nothing 
sure in israeli politics but at the moment we can say he has a 
majority with 61 seats 
likud has the support of three orthodox factions and two 
independent members who are also religious 
ahimeir said likud hoped to add four members of the agudat israel 
ultraorthodox party after the coalition was approved by parliament 
that would give shamir control over 65 seats 
agudat israel has conditioned support on likud assurances that it 
would ban the sale of pork in israel and curtail public 
transportation on the jewish sabbath 
the deciding votes for shamir came monday from the twoseat 
moledet or homeland faction that advocates expelling 
palestinians from israeliheld territory the party held out for 
weeks demanding control of the police ministry and cancellation of 
an initiative to hold palestinian elections in the west bank and 
gaza strip 
moledet leader rehavam zeevi said he would support the new 
cabinet without formally joining because of the differences he 
declined to sign a coalition agreement as is customary 
shamirs peace plan is also opposed by two other rightwing 
coalition partners the prosettlement tehiya and tzomet factions 
but ahimeir insisted the plan would be included in the new 
governments policy guidelines 
we are committed to the plan without any doubts said 
ahimeir this new government although it is called narrow and 
rightwing will work to advance the peace process 
despite the tenuous agreements reached likud leaders feel 
confident the rightwing parties would prefer compromising with 
likud rather than seeing a possible new likud union with labor

the grain agreement signed by president bush 
and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev continues the principal trade 
between the two countries that is nowhere near its potential a food 
processing executive said monday 
we could be doing 250 billion a year in trade said george 
melnykovich president of the food processing machinery and supplies 
association 
bush and gorbachev signed a fiveyear agreement friday to 
increase the annual minimum shipments of us grain to the soviets 
to 10 million metric tons from 9 million tons recent shipments have 
greatly exceeded the minimums 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds about 367 bushels of wheat 
or 394 bushels of corn 
the current pact which has been in effect since 1983 expires 
dec 31 such grain agreements have existed since 1976 
the agreement is worth roughly 6 billion to 8 billion to 
farmers and exporters over the five years said agriculture 
department analyst cina radler its impossible to pinpoint the 
exact value because of fluctuations in market price she said 
take out the grain agreement and the rest of trade between the 
two countries in infinitesimal said melnykovich but he said the 
soviets want so much and the united states has so much to offer that 
trade should mushroom 
the main problem is money he said the soviet ruble is not worth 
much outside the soviet union so american companies dont want to 
be paid in soviet currency 
melnykovich predicted that in the next five years the soviet 
government would make the ruble a freely convertible currency that 
could be used in world trade 
melnykovich is one of the organizers of a threeday conference in 
washington that is bringing together 55 soviet ministers to discuss 
the state of the soviet food system and with us food companies 
its an unprecedented meeting between leaders of one us 
industry and top soviet officials said anthony jf oreilly 
chief ececutive officer of the hj heinz co and conference 
chairman 
though germany and japan also are probing the soviet market 
melynkovich said the soviet union would rather do business with the 
united states 
the fact that the countries were allies in world war ii against 
germany and japan is important but also because the countries are 
both geographically large and need efficient food distribution 
systems 
it doesnt take much to get from one point to another in small 
countries like japan and germany said melnykovich 
the soviets are asking how is it that the us does it he 
said 
vladilen nikitin the soviet equivalent to the us secretary of 
agriculture said the conference was the first step toward 
increasing sale of agricultural commodities to the soviet union 
as for the grain agreement he said we got what we expected 
he noted that wednesday he would be signing an agreement on food 
processing with agriculture secretary clayton yeutter and commerce 
secretary robert mosbacher 
we need all types of products he said speaking through an 
interpreter 
soviet grain purchases in most years have exceeded the required 
minimums in 198889 for example sales were more than double the 
specified minimum 
much wheat recently all of it has been sold to the soviet 
union with the help of export subsidies a sale of 92 million 
bushels 250000 metric tons in may for june delivery carried a 
subsidy of 50 cents per bushel 1818 per ton no 2 red wheat now 
sells for about 350 per bushel 12845 per ton on the kansas 
city spot market 
no other grains are eligible for the export subsidies 
the kremlin will have some greater yeartoyear flexibility under 
the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat and 
feed grains although over the life of the pact the minimums will be 
met officials said 
the soviets will be committed to buying at least 4 million tons 
each of wheat and feed grains however in any one year moscow may 
substitute up to 750000 tons of one commodity for the other 
for the first time the pact includes barley and sorghum as feed 
grains 
additional flexibility also was provided by giving moscow 
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually 
without further discussion with washington 
the automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons 
although the united states has routinely increased that to fit 
soviet needs 
as of may 31 the soviets had bought more than 167 million tons 
of us wheat and corn under the current agreement for delivery this 
year last years sales totaled a record 217 million tons

salmon runs on two western rivers have steadily 
declined over the past 20 years and populations at some dams last 
year were the lowest ever observed a report released monday said 
sen mark hatfield rore asked the national marine fisheries 
service and the oregon department of fish and wildlife to study the 
runs on the columbia and snake rivers 
clearly we know from this report that the runs are in trouble 
clearly the fish are declining particularly on the snake river 
the stocks are way down said bill calder hatfields press 
secretary 
oregon trout a portlandbased conservation group has asked the 
nmfs to place four salmon runs in the columbia river basin on the 
endangered species list the four are the native runs of lower 
columbia coho salmon as well as the snake rivers spring summer and 
fall chinook salmon 
hatfield said in march he wanted the report in hand to help get a 
head start on the listing process and avoid some of the political 
rhetoric that has surrounded the debate over whether to list the 
northern spotted owl as a threatened species 
the report provides a perspective on the salmon runs in 
question but does not provide a basis for definitive judgments on 
the status of the runs under the endangered species act its authors 
said 
in a letter to hatfield nmfs regional director rolland schmitten 
and oregon department of fish and wildlife director randy fisher 
said we share your concern over salmon runs and other users of 
columbia river water 
mark chilcote natural production program manager for the oregon 
department of fish and wildlife said the report basically compiled 
previous studies to give an overview on the status of the fish in 
the region 
the report based its population counts primarily on escapements 
the number of fish that avoid being caught and safely return to 
their spawning grounds and redd counts which are the easily 
observable nests that female salmon dig in riverbottom gravel to 
lay eggs

drug policy director william j bennett was on 
course to earn more than 500000 last year before he returned from 
private life to public office according to financial disclosure 
forms released monday 
during the first 2 months before he took office march 10 
bennett earned 80246 from speeches and consulting work plus 
25962 in salary as president of the madison center a private 
policy research group he created 
if the 106208 income from the early months had held up 
throughout 1989 he could have earned about 550000 not including 
interest on savings 
instead the government started paying him after march 10 at the 
rate of 99500 for a full year or about 80000 for the rest of 
1989 
adding that salary to the earnings of the first couple of months 
plus his declared interest earnings gave bennett an approximate 
income of 191209 to 201208 for 1989 
his interest earnings totaled between 5001 and 15000 
bennett known as one of the poorest members of president 
reagans cabinet when he was education secretary saw his income 
zoom after he resigned that job sept 20 1988 thanks to the 
madison center and invitations from across the country to speak 
he realized before he became president bushs director of the 
office of national drug control policy that his earnings would 
nosedive saying at the time well we had a good christmas 
bennett still does not own a home despite his few lucrative 
months he and his wife elayne who works for a project at 
georgetown university funded by the bradley foundation live with 
their two young sons in a rented home in suburban maryland 
his assets went down somewhat last year according to the form 
which does not mention personal property such as automobiles and 
which lists assets only in ranges 
in 1988 bennetts assets ranged from 301003 to 356002 and 
up bennett stated his net worth in early 1989 was about 432600 
not including cars in a financial statement provided to the senate 
judiciary committee that handled his confirmation hearing 
for 1989 bennetts assets ranged from 150002 to 350000 the 
form as filled out by bennett indicated assets of 65002 to 
150000 but spokesman don hamilton responding to a query 
regarding the dramatic drop said the form had been filled out in 
error and would be amended to reflect the higher asset level 
even at the higher level the maximum assets would be about 
82600 less than they were in 1988 
bennett signed a contract in late 1988 with simon amp shuster 
publishers to produce two books and he received advanced royalties 
of 187500 his current financial disclosure form says he will 
receive royalties from the publication of a book yet no book has 
been published 
hamilton said that although bennett completed the manuscript for 
one book it will not be published until he is out of office

the white house said monday president bush will 
nominate david h leroy former lieutenant governor of idaho as the 
negotiator charged with launching a new search for a palce to put 
the nations growing inventory of highly radioactive nuclear waste 
leroy 42 of boise idaho will canvass governors indian tribal 
leaders and others in hopes of uncovering a site willing to become a 
temporary or permanent highlevel nuclear waste repository 
in a telephone interview from his law offices leroy said the 
task could make him the most unpopular person in america 
but he called it an important mission that could help solve a 
problem fraught with moral political and scientific 
ramifications 
he promised to mount an aggressive effort to search the 
country and us territories for localities that may have an 
untapped interest in accepting a nuclear waste repository 
congress ordered the president to appoint an independent nuclear 
waste negotiator in 1987 at the same time it designated nevadas 
yucca mountain on a nuclear weapons testing range as the most likely 
site for a repository 
the 1987 legislation ordered the energy department to drop work 
on two other candidate sites in texas and washington state and to 
begin the expensive detailed subterranean geological investigation 
necessary to see if yucca mountain is suitable for an installation 
that must confine the waste for at least 10000 years 
underground research has not yet begun the state of nevada has 
refused to grant permits for it and the question is tied up in court 
leroy a republican who narrowly lost a bid to unseat democratc 
gov cecil andrus in 1986 said congress felt very strongly that 
an aggressive effort should be made to determine whether there were 
any locations with a technically sound repository site that might be 
willing to assume a larger role voluntarily 
if the search produces a willing taker leroy is also charged 
with recommending acceptable terms to congress the legislation gave 
the negotiator until 1991 to complete the search leroy said a 
quick start is essential 
if confirmed he will operate independently from the department 
of energy but will not be responsible to the department it is a 
parttime post and leroy said he will keep up his law practice in 
boise 
leroy was idahos attorney general from 1979 to 1983 and its 
lieutenant governor from 1983 to 1987

despite pockets of protest soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev charmed a university crowd of 
thousands with handshakes smiles and waves monday to cheers of 
gorby gorby 
gorbachevs 50car motorcade reached stanford university shortly 
before noon about an hour behind schedule the soviet leader who 
delivered a speech on global affairs at the campus was greeted by 
former secretary of state george p shultz university president 
donald kennedy and californias two us senators alan cranston 
and pete wilson 
as he walked across campus two students in the cheering audience 
held up a sign reading gorby 4 president 
he waded into the audiences at various times shaking hands 
clapping and clasping his own hands smiling and through an 
interpreter telling a woman in a wheelchair with a video camera 
you are so wellequipped 
i shook his hand it was amazing he was definitely just a 
real person but he was gorbachev he was leading the pack hoping 
his bodyguards could keep up said alex levy a 21yearold 
political science major 
he was great he came up and grabbed my hand added erik 
jorgensen 
i think sometime in the future well all be united together in 
one big team said louie arciga 
but hundreds of demonstrators remained immune from the 
gorbymania gripping others 
protesters supporting independence for lithuania and other 
baltic states and angered over alleged human rights violations in 
the republics said they were trying to show the american public 
that gorbachev isnt a hero 
people have been so much taken by their gorbymania that i dont 
think many are hearing us the people have been taken by the charm 
of gorby said lithuanianborn algis zemaitaitis who drove six 
hours from santa monica to join the protest at stanford 
as the gorbachev motorcade rolled down stanford universitys palm 
drive the demonstrators intensified their chants of out of the 
baltic states 
onlookers disgruntled that the protesters were blocking the view 
of the soviet leader chanted in response out of the way 
in the face of the soviet leaders visit capitalism flourished 
as some students who won a lottery for tickets to see gorbachev 
traded their prizes for fistfuls of hard cash from the wealthy 
other students scrambled to pick up some of the remaining tickets 
that went unclaimed after the official university lottery last week 
for the 1700 seats at gorbachevs talk and 6000 others to the rest 
of the events on his university visit 
gorbachev probably would have felt right at home this 
morning said jorgensen a 21yearold student who waited for 
tickets beginning at 2 am the lines we stood in were very much 
like the food lines in the soviet union 
though jorgensen hung onto his ticket other students said they 
had friends who scalped theirs for up to 1400 each there were 
rumors passes had gone for up to 1800 apiece 
two sophomores jeff vierling a 19yearold electrical 
engineering major and marlowe johnson a 21yearold international 
relations major sat on a curb at the university monday asking for 
serious offers only of 1000 or more cash for each of their two 
tickets 
the tickets are worth a great deal to me but the only value 
here is sentimental i can probably see him better on tv said 
johnson who wants to finance a trip to europe 
added vierling its airplane tickets its a lot of things 
its a cd player

president bush said monday that china continues 
to violate human rights a year after the tiananmen square massacre 
but a democratic leader said bush is all talk and no action on the 
issue 
bush incurred the wrath of many members of congress last month by 
extending for a year mostfavorednation trading status under which 
beijing receives low tariffs on its goods 
on monday bush issued a statement critical of chinese leaders 
calling on them to turn decisively away from repression but he 
did not alter his stance on trade benefits to china 
bush said his administration values good relations with the 
chinese people and government and is ready to develop this 
relationship as china resumes a path of reform 
senate majority leader george mitchell also used the anniversary 
to speak out on the issue reiterating democratic complaints that 
bush actually is lending support to beijing by continuing it 
mostfavored trade status 
the chinese people must be told that the presidents silence 
does not represent the view of all americans mitchell said 
diane dewhirst mitchells spokeswoman said later that the 
majority leader had not seen the presidents statement and would 
have no comment 
bush a former us envoy to china praised china for reforms 
undertaken from 1978 to 1988 but said he remained deeply 
concerned by the lack of respect for internationally recognized 
human rights in china today and urge a rapid return to the more 
positive course set before tiananmen occurred 
he said the chinese government in suppressing demonstrations 
was denying its citizens the freedom of expression freedom of the 
press and freedom of association 
these are freedoms that are enshrined in both the us 
constitution and the chinese constitution bush said 
some sanctions bush imposed on china in the aftermath of the 
tiananmen square crackdown including a ban on military sales 
remain in force 
mitchell who said it was a mistake to renew the 
mostfavorednation status said he would try to block the extension 
when congress returns tuesday from its memorial day recess 
students in beijing have risked their freedom and perhaps even 
their lives to demonstrate their memory of last years events 
mitchell said americans know that if we let this anniversary go 
by unmarked we will share in the shame the chinese government 
brought on itself 
more than 1000 people reportedly were killed in the crackdown 
june 4 1989 
mitchell plans to meet with dissident students later this week 
one of those dissidents a 24yearold woman who hid from chinese 
authorities for 10 months after leading student protests in 
tiananmen square appealed monday for american and international 
pressure to curb human rights abuses in her homeland 
chai ling said at a news conference that she wants to meet with 
bush to tell him that his decision to renew the mostfavorednation 
status disappointed the survivors of chinas democracy movement 
i plea to the people of the world you must not forget those 
who gave up their lives for freedom and democracy let your words of 
support be heard she said 
meanwhile sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee joined about 150 lawmakers in signing a 
letter asking chinese prime minister li peng to release jailed 
protesters halt torture prohibit secret executions and stop using 
lethal force against peaceful demonstrators the letter was drafted 
by amnesty international 
elsewhere the anniversary was marked in this country with 
demonstrations in los angeles atlanta and salt lake city some 
200300 people attended those rallies 
in new york lu jinghua a participant in the tiananmen uprising 
last year tried without success to deliver a prodemocracy letter 
to the chinese mission to the united nations on monday 
ive never once regretted taking part she said my 
experience was the most significant action of my life and gave me a 
taste of freedom

a senior election 
official on monday accused former us president jimmy carter of 
intervening in domincan affairs and of being partial to expresident 
juan bosch who says fraud marred the may 16 elections 
president joaquin balaguer held a slim 21694vote lead over 
bosch in unofficial results which gave balaguer 669063 votes 
bosch 647369 and jose francisco pena gomez a former santo 
domingo mayor 438647 
carter was one of 30 international observers here for the 
balloting he was invited by froilan tavares president of the 
central election board 
on monday tavares said carter was misinformed by aides who 
observed a review of tally sheets carried out last week to 
determine if there was fraud 
bosch 80 had accused balaguer 83 and blind from glaucoma of 
colossal fraud and said tavares was in league with the 
president who has served five terms in this caribbean nation of 7 
million people 
tavares on monday suspended the tally review saying a survey of 
60 percent of the totals showed no errors or evidence of fraud he 
said the review was not mandatory under the countrys election law 
the next step would be for the election board to announce an 
official winner an action that can be formally challenged by bosch 
tavares said carter was misinformed by his inexperienced 
representatives mark feierstein and alejandro canton of the 
atlantabased carter institute he said the two met only officials 
from one party and gave carter wrong and biased information 
he scolded carter for writing balaguer a letter on may 22 that 
ignored the autonomy of the election board and was a virtual 
intervention in the internal affairs of our country 
the contents of the letter were not divulged 
before returning home carter said the thin lead made it 
impossible to determine a winner and recommended the tally sheets be 
scrutinized for possible fraud or honest errors 
several international observers and dominican politicians have 
accused balaguers social christian reformist party of buying votes 
and questioned delays in votecounting

spiritual leader ali khamenei said monday 
that iran will follow the path set by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
but iranians showed relatively little enthusiasm on the first 
anniversary of the patriarchs death 
death to america blared loudspeakers death to israel 
inside the shrine that marks khomeinis grave mourners listened 
as speakers recited koranic verses the graybearded khomeini stared 
sternly at the crowd from pictures hung on pillars 
while there is islam we will not forget the imam read one 
banner khomeini was considerd the imam or supreme spiritual leader 
addressing the crowd khamenei said the imams line is that 
same line which we pledge to follow 
khomeini was 86 when he died june 3 10 years after his islamic 
revolution toppled shah mohammad reza pahlavi he was buried at the 
shrine in the beheshte zahra cemetery 10 miles south of tehran 
the first anniversary of khomeinis death stood in sharp contrast 
to the bizarre outpouring of grief during his june 6 funeral last 
year at that time 6 million frenzied mourners poured into the 
streets pounding their heads with clenched fists beating their 
chests and scratching their faces to draw blood 
mondays event the culmination of a fourday mourning period 
brought about 3 million people to the shrine on the outskirts of 
tehran according to foreign reporters who flew over the scene in 
helicopters that was far fewer than expected 
irans official news media however said 89 million people 
participated 
tehran normally a hodgepodge of activity was quiet and streets 
were deserted many residents apparently preferred to stay home than 
go to the shrine 
at khomeinis tomb the atmosphere was that of a social gathering 
only a few mourners beat their chests in the traditional shiite 
moslem expression of grief although larger groups of mourners would 
occasionally tap their chests in symbolic fashion 
inside the shrine segregated by sex a few people fainted in 90 
degree heat and guards sprayed water to cool the crowd at 
khomeinis funeral about 28000 people passed out because of heat 
dehydration or exhaustion 
disabled men in wheelchairs reminders of the iraniraq war were 
pushed into the shrine by revolutionary guards wearing black 
armbands to mark the occasion 
a young soldier with blisters on his feet from three days of 
walking to reach the shrine said i came last year and i had to 
come again this year 
thousands of mourners were bused in from villages towns and 
other cities soldiers and other civil servants were ordered to 
attend the ceremonies hundreds of shiites also came from pakistan 
india syria and lebanon 
iranian television which broadcast live coverage of the funeral 
last year did not broadcast any of the events live 
in commemorations elsewhere hundreds of mourners gathered inside 
the mosque at khomeinis home in jamaran sobbing and beating 
themselves as they looked at a chair on a small balcony from which 
khomeini would address his people 
the ayatollah had long suffered heart problems and died after 
surgery for intestinal bleeding 
a year after his death many followers who participated in the 
islamic revolution have become disillusioned disgruntled with high 
inflation official corruption and the unfulfilled promises of the 
revolution 
most of the economic woes are from the eightyear war with iraq 
and from khomeinis implacable antiwestern stance which blocked 
foreign investment and western technology 
khomeinis staunch followers such as his only surviving son 
ahmad an important figure in the socalled radical camp within the 
leadership want no deviation from his teachings 
but others such as president hashemi rafsanjani have indicated 
they want revolutionary fervor dampened in favor of economic 
reconstruction 
in a veiled attack on proponents of that policy ahmad told 
ideologically committed revolutionary guards recently do not 
deviate from the imams path if others do i trust you will not let 
them 
meanwhile the largest exile iranian opposition group the 
mujahedeen khalq said in asociated press in 
nicosia cyprus there were antigovernment demonstrations in iran 
in the telex from its office in baghdad the group said clashes 
between students and government sec telex to the asurity forces were reported 
in 
tehran tabriz esfahan and orumiyeh it said at least 300 students 
were arrested in orumiyeh 
the government did not comment on the reports and there was no 
immediate way to verify them

prime minister brian mulroney met with the 10 
provincial premiers on monday for the third time io seize buses and terminals 
as the company struggled into the 
fourth month of a drivers strike 
officials said the filing would not affect service at the only 
nationwide bus company 
we have taken this action to enable greyhound lines to continue 
operation of its of its total system said j michael doyle 
senior vice president and chief financial officer 
the petition was filed with the us bankruptcy court for the 
southern district of texas in brownsville 
the filing under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code allows 
the company to continue operating under court supervision while it 
tries to reorganize its finances and pay off creditors 
union officials were not immediately available to comment on the 
bankruptcy filing 
greyhound has been struggling since bus drivers walked out march 
2 the company has been operating a reduced schedule but the sliced 
revenue and increased expenses of fighting the strike have siphoned 
off cash needed to operate 
the company lost 56 million in the first quarter it has missed 
more than 16 million in principal interest and lease payments 
since the end of april putting it in default on numerous agreements 
with creditors 
in the past few days there has been a lot of pressure by 
creditors who own buses and terminals that the company leases 
said president frank schmieder 
we tried to stay out of bankruptcy as long as possible 
schmieder said 
there will be no interruption of service doyle said adding 
that the company had asked the bankruptcy court to honor tickets 
already purchased 
for the passengers bankruptcy ought to be pretty 
transparent schmieder said the network is up in full and were 
going to need all the employees that we currently have 
two weeks ago the company proposed repurchasing 225 million of 
its junk bond debt at a steep discount provided it could find 
enough financing to pay about 90 million for the bonds and leave 
the company with about 35 million in operating capital 
we have asked creditors for patience so that we could devote 
all available resources to running maximum service during the peak 
summer travel season doyle said 
while most have been cooperative we were faced with the threat 
of a run on assets that could have crippled our ability to 
operate he said 
we are highly confident we will be successful in restructuring 
our debt doyle added 
schmieder said negotiations are continuing on financing the debt 
restructuring but it will take longer now because the courts will 
have to approve any financial restructuring 
the company did not estimate when it hoped to emerge from court 
supervision 
the filing covers greyhound and five subsidiaries including eagle 
bus manufacturing co which is based in brownsville the other 
subsidiaries are gli bus operations holding co buslease inc 
trailways commuter transit inc and gli food services inc 
most of greyhounds 6300 drivers walked out over wages and job 
security the company has been operating a reduced schedule with 
nearly 3000 newly hired drivers 
after attempts to reopen negotiations collapsed early last month 
chairman fred g currey said may 7 the strike had become 
irrelevant because the carrier had enough drivers to operate 
just two weeks later however the company acknowledged severe 
financial difficulties and said the proposed repurchase of junk 
bonds was necessary to avert bankruptcy 
the companys total debt stood at 384 million at the end of 
march the debt is the legacy of a leveraged buyout three years ago 
led by currey that took the company private 
currey and other investors paid 270 million for the bus 
operations of greyhound corp since renamed greyhound dial corp a 
few months later they paid an additional 80 million for 
dallasbased trailways lines inc then the nations largest 
operator of trailways buses 
greyhounds future also was clouded recently by a finding by the 
national labor relations board that greyhound engaged in unfair 
labor practices by implementing its contract proposal immediately 
after the strike began 
an administrative law judge has scheduled hearings on the matter 
in milwaukee on sept 17 the procedure could result in the bus 
company being forced to pay about 10 million a month in back wages 
greyhound has said it is confident it will win once the case gets in 
court

1993 new york telephone officials said 
the phone company said the telephone numbers in the 212 area code

a bolt of lightning in the night killed 30 
pedigreed black angus cattle huddling in the rain 
george ahlfield said heard the loud crack of thunder but wasnt 
prepared for the grisly scene monday morning 
heaps of dead cows lay scattered in the field with the surviving 
animals hovering nearby the thunderstorm sunday night killed about 
half his herd 
this is a very severe loss its just one of those things a 
person never counts on and that you think will never happen to 
you he said but when it does it hurts 
no other storm damage was reported in the area 
but its extremely odd for that many cattle to be killed

despite mikhail s gorbachevs note of 
urgency there will be plenty of opportunities in the soviet union 
later for companies unwilling to deploy their dollars now one big 
soviet trading partner said monday 
it always pays one to be first said whitney macmillan 
chairman of cargill inc the giant commodities company that is the 
soviets largest private trading partner but he said the facts 
are that the opportunities wont disappear 
john block former us agriculture secretary agreed 
the first wave that goes in there is vitally important block 
said but that doesnt mean there wont be a second wave theyll 
need a second and third wave as the economy progresses 
in a 90minute meeting sunday in minneapolis the soviet leader 
told about 100 business leaders that those who are with us at this 
time have a good prospect of cooperation in our great country 
then he added but those who just stand on the sidelines who 
do not want to risk who want to wait and see who dont want to 
risk their dollars well they will remain i think observers for 
years to come 
well make sure that that is so gorbachev said 
robert price a former chief executive officer of control data 
corp which has long had a relationship with the soviet union said 
the inability to convert rubles to dollars or other hard currency 
must be overcome if gorbachev is to win new us investment in his 
country 
everything is the money problem price said he gorbachev 
cant wish it to go away he cant and we cant 
gorbachev said help from us companies in management 
agriculture transportation medicine and computer technology is 
needed to stabilize the ussr as it moves to a marketdriven 
economy 
i think he is just stating a true fact of human life that 
loyalty is important said dwayne andreas chief executive officer 
of archer daniels midland co of decatur ill it brings to my 
mind the girl who says im going to go home with the man who 
brought me 
cargills macmillan said he did not take gorbachevs remark 
seriously opportunities in the soviet union will grow he said as 
the decisionmaking process becomes decentralized thus reducing 
the possibility of bureaucratic revenge 
i took it that they are eager for investment and i guess i 
take it much as a statement of fact rather than a threat said 
allen jacobson chief executive officer of 3m co if you dont get 
in early to most places you get left out 
but business leaders with less experience in ussoviet trade 
were more shaken by gorbachevs remark 
they do try to keep track of who they consider their friends 
said winston wallin chairman of minneapolisbased medtronic inc 
the worlds largest maker of cardiac pacemakers he did say it in 
kind of a humorous way but it did have a little teeth in it 
dwight opperman chief executive officer of west publishing inc 
in st paul said companies that dont invest in the soviet economy 
now may indeed be left out when the country is prospering 
help him now and you may get in on the golden pot at the end of 
the rainbow said opperman whose company has never done business 
in the soviet union its a carrot you give him a carrot and a 
whip both 
curt carlson founder of minnesotabased carlson companies said 
it would be unfair for the soviets to discriminate in the future 
against companies not ready to answer his call for help because 
current conditions for trade between the united states and soviet 
union are difficult

hea kim was at the counter of her familys 
store monday watching television coverage of soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachevs visit to the san francisco bay area when in 
walked raisa gorbachev 
i didnt know about it at all mrs kim said of the soviet 
first ladys impromptu shopping stop i was surprised 
mrs gorbachev scrapping announced plans suddenly embarked on 
her own whirlwind tour of san francisco including a visit to the 
new terrace market in the twin peaks neighborhood 
accompanied by an interpreter and several secret service men 
mrs gorbachev spent about 10 minutes asking mrs kim questions and 
doing a bit of comparison shopping as her limousine drew a crowd of 
onlookers 
i think she was just checking the items we carry in this small 
market mrs kim said of the store she and her husband own and 
operate in an upscale neighborhood 
she looked at what items we carry and how they move especially 
the fresh and frozen foods she added 
mrs gorbachev also specifically checked the markets supply of 
vodka 
i think she wanted to know if we carry stolichnaya mrs kim 
said of the popular brand imported from the soviet union then she 
looked at the smirnoff the kind made in the us 
the wife of the soviet leader wanted to know why there were only 
a few bottles of stolichnaya left on the markets shelves 
i told her it was because stolichnaya is the bestselling vodka 
we have mrs kim said she smiled 
mrs gorbachev also was interested in bread asking mrs kim 
about her customers preferences and learning they prefer 
wholewheat to white 
despite her interest in the merchandise mrs gorbachev didnt 
buy anything and explained through the interpreter that she couldnt 
take anything from the store with her as mrs kim offered 
but the soviet first lady left plenty of friends behind 
she was very friendly and shes very pretty and she held 
my hand afterward mrs kim said 
patty corwin who lives nearby and shops at the kims was about 
to pick up her children from school when she noticed the limousine 
outside the market she went with a neighbor to investigate and saw 
mrs gorbachev leave the store 
mrs gorbachev spent a few minutes outside talking with 
neighborhood residents and construction workers from nearby 
condominium projects who gathered as close as security personnel 
would allow 
she walked around and shook my hand and shook my neighbors 
hand mrs corwin said adding she said something like pleased 
to meet you in english

the los angeles county board of supervisors 
violated the rights of hispanics in 1981 by drawing voting districts 
that keep them from getting elected a federal judge ruled monday 
us district judge david kenyon ruling in a voting rights case 
said the boards five members conspired to protect their 
incumbencies and that of their allies when they redrew the 
countys five voting districts in 1981 
in so doing kenyon said the supervisors violated the 1965 
federal voting rights act and the equal protection clause of the 
14th amendment to the constitution 
hispanics make up about 35 percent of the countys 87 million 
people no member of any minority group has been elected to the 
board since 1875 
the mexican american legal defense and educational fund and the 
american civil liberties union foundation of southern california 
expressed jubilation at the ruling and demanded the results of two 
elections set for tuesday be invalidated 
county counsel dewitt clinton was in budget hearings monday and 
unavailable for comment but fifth district supervisor mike 
antonovich who is not up for reelection said the ruling would be 
appealed 
maldef the civil liberties group and the us justice department 
had sued in 1988 accusing the supervisors of deliberately spreading 
the hispanic population across several districts to keep hispanics 
from getting elected 
this is truly a great and historic day said marc rosenbaum 
an attorney for the civil liberties group 
for 115 years the los angeles county board of supervisors has 
been an exclusive male allwhite club today that club membership 
is open to everyone 
in washington us attorney general dick thornburgh hailed the 
decision as a victory against discrimination in the most important 
role citizens play in our democracy the right to vote in free and 
fair elections in districts drawn without bias 
representatives of both sides said it wasnt immediately clear 
how the issue will be resolved 
maldef officials said they would demand the immediate creation of 
a largely hispanic district 
we want a remedy that encompasses a fair opportunity for our 
community to represent itself and to elect representatives who will 
represent its interests said antonia hernandez president and 
general counsel for maldef 
she and rosenbaum also said new elections should be held in the 
first and third supervisorial districts where voting takes place 
tuesday 
ed edelman who is seeking reelection in the third district 
declined comment on kenyons ruling 
in the first district retiring supervisor pete schabarum said he 
had not read kenyons decision i continue to believe however 
that district lines should not be based on ethnic factors he 
said and i find it incredulous that a 1981 plan can be overturned 
based on 1990 demographics 
in his ruling the judge concluded that hispanics and 
nonhispanics are widely polarized when it comes to voting 
hispanics vote in large numbers for fellow hispanics he said and 
nonhispanics rarely vote for hispanics 
given the estimated levels of polarization including the 
effects of nonhispanic bloc voting an hispanic candidate is unable 
to be elected to the board under the current configuration of 
supervisorial districts kenyon said

a woman who angered neighbors and got in 
trouble with zoning authorities for taking in homeless mothers 
charged the young women despite repeated claims to be sheltering 
them for free a former resident says 
charlene luther a 22yearold unwed mother also said donna 
russell told her to give a phony address to bridgeports welfare 
department so she could continue to receive welfare checks after she 
moved to russells home in trumbull 
luther who stayed at the house during her pregnancy from january 
to march said in sundays bridgeport post that russell charged her 
and two other pregnant residents onethird of their monthly welfare 
checks and took their food stamps and other assistance 
it was a requirement of living there luther said we were 
no more than maids who cooked and cleaned for russell and her two 
sons and a way to pay the bills 
russell on monday denied the allegations were in the process 
of preparing a rebuttal she said 
in an interview in april russell said she had been called by 
the lord to open her house to the homeless she said that she was 
not charging families to live with her but that they bought some of 
their own food 
last week on the nationally syndicated tv show hard copy 
she said those girls have not paid five cents to live in that 
house 
town zoning officials acting on a complaint from a neighbor had 
ordered her to stop taking in young homeless mothers and had 
threatened her with arrest 
the zoning board of appeals scheduled a hearing for wednesday on 
russells request for a variance to continue using her house as a 
shelter 
the zoning law in this community of 33000 requires that 
threequarters of the people living in a singlefamily dwelling be 
related by blood marriage or adoption

the other of their colleagues from the committee of soviet 
scientists against the nuclear threat and others thank you very 
much i take advantage of this opportunity to thank you most 
warmly and i hope that you will join me in this 
we dont want new weapons to come to replace nuclear weapons 
i think that the warning is quite necessary and quite approriate and 
timely at this moment we would like scientists and engineers to 
work on these issues and other disarmament problems president 
bush and i had to note that it is not that easy to destroy those 
weapons once weve decided to scrap them we need technologies for 
destroying dangerous weapons make sure there is no damage to the 
environment and to peoples health 
i hope that we will lick those problems by joining our efforts 
ive heard that stanford scientists would like to cooperate closely 
with their soviet colleagues on the problem of the environment 
i must also note stanfords contribution to sovietamerican 
cooperation on highly important superconductivity our countries are 
leaders in this field 
the soviet union and the united states are leaders in such things 
as the fundamental properties of matter solid state physics 
mathematics physical chemistry astronomy and space research and 
biological sciences cooperation in these knowledges would also 
be of great interest 
ladies and gentlemen for our country we have opted for 
fundamental changes our perestroika is the result of profound 
trends taking place in our society in the last five years our 
country has become different but i also think that all mankind is 
entering a new age and that the world is beginning to obey new laws 
and logic we have yet to adjust ourselves to

four highranking contra leaders 
demobilized on monday and became representatives in government 
ministries that will help rebel fighters return to civilian life 
the four were the highestranking contra leaders to demobilize 
but it appears total rebel disarmament by the june 10 deadline is 
unlikely 
an agreement signed by the contras and the government on 
wednesday specifies contra representation in government ministries 
but the agreement to disarm at least 500 contras a day has not 
been met and even if it were half the contras would remain under 
arms by june 10 the day agreed to by the rebels following talks 
with the new government of violeta barrios de chamorro 
top contra leader israel galeano blamed the limited numbers of 
un peacekeeping troops and organization of american states 
officials who have been processing rebels who want to disarm for 
the slow pace of the demobilization 
but un peacekeeper lt col luis alejandre who is in charge of 
security zone six said many contras show up at the zone without 
their weapons and are turned back 
alejandre said the rebels had probably buried their weapons 
you can imagine the traffic in illegal weapons there would be 
if the un troops accepted rebels who did not hand over a weapon 
alejandre said 
he said that since sunday the contras have started turning in 
high quality weapons 
the ones before were all rusted out alejandre said 
galeano said the contras had left 7000 weapons behind in 
honduran camps before returning to nicaragua 
the four contra leaders who demobilized on monday were miguel 
angel sosa the contra army general staff inspector also known as 
commander emiliano enrique zelaya the medical chief of staff also 
known as commander henry or dr henry contra political advisor 
bernardo pastora and political advisor boanerge matus 
zelaya a medical doctor is to join the health ministry sosa 
and pastora are to go to the repatriation institute and matus is to 
join the agrarian reform institute 
of an estimated 13000 rebels only about 4000 have disarmed 
galeano said that although it was unlikely that the demobilization 
would be completed by june 10 we have embarked on an irreversible 
process

apparent softening of gorbachevs stand a us official said in 
washington

germany could be a nato member but he says the military alliance 
must be altered to reflect the political changes in the east bloc 
and wants an eventual new european security system

we are witnessing an evolution in international relations of 
increasingly open and massscale human communication 
for a new type of progress throughout the world to become a 
reality everyone must change 
im convinced that we are on the threshold of revising the 
concept of alliance building until now alliances have built on a 
selective and in fact discriminatory basis 
they were based on setting countries against each other they 
divided countries and peoples much more than they united them this 
system that was perfected during the years of the cold war of 
the north atlantic alliance and the warsaw pact but we are 
approaching a time when the very principle of alliance building 
should become different 
i think that both the united states and the soviet union have to 
understand the need for this 
i see many young people here there are many more young people 
outside this room of course and im glad i was able to greet them 
too 
when i conclude my remarks i would like to address them i would 
like to address young people your generation will not only begin 
creating a new world but will also live in it much of it will 
certainly be different from whatever we can imagine now from what 
ive been saying to you here from this rostrum the challenge is to 
make sure that people in that new world live a better life in 
greater freedom much will depend on you the men and women of 
science i wish you success in this great and unprecedented 
undertaking thank you

gov bob martinez named a south florida 
lawman as his running mate monday even though j allison defoor ii 
was reprimanded by the state supreme court in 1986 while sitting as 
a county judge 
defoor now the monroe county sheriff was charged with 
improperly taking part in other political races using his office 
for private and financial gain and establishing a policy allowing 
speeders to pay double the fine to keep traffic offenses off their 
driving records 
martinezs press secretary jon peck said the republican 
governor was aware of defoors ethical runin 
the governor knew about it and didnt believe it would be a 
problem for the campaign said peck 
martinez who hoped a fresh face in the lieutenant governor slot 
would help jumpstart the first week of fulltime campaigning 
described defoor 36 as a proven performer uniquely qualified 
to represent the florida of tomorrow 
the governors campaign manager jm mac stipanovich said 
of the reprimand we deemed it inconsequential we dont think any 
defense is required 
the judicial qualifications commission in 1986 charged that 
defoor 
improperly aided the candidacies of two friends richard j 
fowler who was running for circuit judge and randall winter who 
was running for public defender 
improperly used his office to promote an electronic leash 
monitoring device in which he held a financial interest the device 
was used to keep track of probationers under house arrest 
violated florida rules by allowing speeders under 70 mph to 
avoid judgment by signing a waiver and paying the clerk of court 
twice the statutory fine 
the court agreed with the commissions finding that defoors 
public reprimand was sufficient punishment because of his contrition 
and acknowledgement of wrongdoing 
defoor left the monroe county bench and returned to private law 
practice in 1987 and was elected sheriff in 1989 
key campaign issues he said include crime and the environment

a dead gray whale was found to have plastic bags 
rubber gloves and other manmade refuse in its stomach but that 
probably didnt kill it an expert said monday 
months of lab tests may be needed to determine what killed the 
whale dubbed spot by animal lovers who tracked its movements through 
puget sound for about 10 weeks the 39foot whale was found dead 
wednesday near hartstene island in the sound about 35 miles 
southwest of seattle 
meanwhile monday the coast guard warned vessels to avoid two 
other dead whales spotted in the strait of juan de fuca 
pieces of wood bark plastic bags cloth rags and two rubber 
gloves were found in spots stomach during a necropsy sunday said 
john calambokidis of the cascadia research collective in olympia 
certainly nothing that we could see in that odd series of items 
would account for a death threat calambokidis said 
analysis of tissue samples taken from spots carcass over the 
weekend could take weeks to several months to complete according to 
a statement issued by cascadia and the marine animal resource center 
of seattle 
gretchen steiger a cascadia research biologist said spot seemed 
to be behaving normally and showed no sign of distress or injury 
before dying

the nations toughest newspaper recycling 
law has been approved in suffolk county on long island where all 
major papers will be required to use 40 percent recycled newsprint 
in their editions by the end of 1996 
the measure was approved may 29 by a 126 vote in the county 
legislature 
a group representing 64 daily papers in the state criticized the 
law 
any use of recycled paper should be market driven said john 
kutzer executive director of the new york newspaper publishers 
association we feel local government is perhaps going overboard 
with these requirements 
the law would apply to all daily and weekly newspapers printed 
sold or distributed in suffolk county provided their suffolk 
circulation is 20000 or more a week advertising circulars are 
included if they meet the circulation requirement 
the bill requires that newspapers be printed on stock containing 
at least 40 percent recycled paper by dec 31 1996 papers that do 
not comply would face a 500 fine each day 
the publisher of newsday the largest circulation daily on long 
island plans to challenge the law in court said spokesman sam 
ruinsky newsday says it uses 17 percent recycled paper for printing 
william k adler manager of corporate relations for the new york 
times cited a voluntary agreement approved by the publishers 
association in which they agreed to gradually increase the use of 
recycled paper that plan set a goal of 40 percent by the year 2000 
since the state has initiated a coordinated program attempts 
by individual counties to legislate their own timetables for 
recycled newsprint are counterproductive said adler 
the times is using 8 percent recycled fiber he said

the florida supreme court ruled may 31 
that the sales tax paid on the purchase of magazines should also be 
applied to newspapers 
the court in a 60 opinion rejected an effort by magazine 
publishers to get the protection enjoyed by newspapers and went 
further deleting the newspaper exemption 
floridas statutory differentiation between magazines and 
newspapers for purposes of sales taxation burdens rights protected 
by the first amendment wrote chief justice raymond ehrlich 
william hyde an attorney who represented the florida press 
association said an appeal to the us supreme court is likely 
its making the acquisition of knowledge more difficult he said 
laura besvinick an attorney representing the miami herald said 
floridas largest newspaper was considering an appeal to the 
nations high court 
we think that a tax on the press impermissibly burdens the 
first amendment she said 
only magazines sold over the counter were taxed before 1987 when 
the state extended the sales tax to a variety of services and to the 
sale of newspapers 
the services tax was repealed in a political firestorm a few 
months later but the status quo was not reestablished newspapers 
regained their exemption while the tax was extended to the sale of 
all magazines 
the magazine publishers of america inc the hearst corp time 
inc golf digesttennis inc and others went to court to challenge 
the distinction

was published as part of a report in the springfield unionnews on 
the sentencing of reputed organized crime figures 
a jury in hampden county superior court on may 29 found that 
anthony j scibelli had been defamed by the republican co 
publisher of the newspaper

was not properly explained in the photograph which pictured him 
with one of the defendants or in the accompanying story published 
dec 11 1987 
scibelli claimed mental anxiety and emotional distress in his 
defamation action 
the jury determined the newspaper was negligent and also found 
for scibelli in his claim that he had been discredited and suffered 
mental anguish as a result

will be filed asking the judge to set aside the jurys findings 
reduce the damage award or grant a new trial 
scibelli did not claim that he had been improperly identified or 
that he had suffered any loss of income as a result of the 
publication he also did not claim that publication of the 
photograph was malicious

news network recalls some of the most famous stories about early 
days at the allnews channel 
author hank whittemores cnn the inside story was released 
june 1 by little brown and company to coincide with the networks 
10th birthday 
among the stories it tells is the time a light bulb exploded in 
the cnn washington bureau and ignited the clothing of oncamera

victimized by the chromakey process which allows one picture to be 
placed behind another all viewers saw was sirokas bald head

mikhail s gorbachev emerged from the summit 
with the trade agreement he wants but members of congress say it 
wont do him any good until he relaxes his pressure on breakaway 
lithuania 
in fact a leading house democrat said sunday that president bush 
can expect challenges from congress on how he handled the 
ussoviet summit in general 
in other words is the congress of the united states going to 
ratify the bush approach to the soviet union which is not to jam it 
to them while theyre weak to lay back a little bit not to try to 
squeeze every drop out of that lemon said rep les aspin dwis 
chairman of the house armed services committee 
aspin appearing on nbctv said that even before bush signed the 
trade pact gorbachev desperately sought the american president 
faced a growing unhappiness from rightleaning republicans who 
see bushs actions as too conciliatory towards the soviets

professor bernard notin wrote last year that 
the nazi gas chambers never existed french jews who lost relatives 
in the holocaust decided in march to teach him a lesson 
minutes after notin began an evening economics lecture about 60 
jewish leaders students and survivors of the death camps walked 
into his classroom at jean moulin university and took over 
they sat notin in the second row and informed him he could not 
leave then told the 20 students their professor had defiled the 
memory of 6 million jews who perished in hitlers extermination 
program 
look mr notin an aging woman said revealing the number 
nazi guards had tattooed on her forearm how do you explain this 
tattoo we are part of the 80000 french at auschwitz and only 3 
percent came back 
notin a leading member of jeanmarie le pens farright national 
front looked at his shoes some of his students wept horrified by 
the survivors accounts 
the confrontation was a high point in the notin affair which 
has provoked debate on political interference in schools and whether 
laws against bigotry restrict freedom of speech 
a recent wave of antisemitic vandalism contributed an extra 
bitterness it included desecration of graves and mutilation of a 
corpse in a jewish cemetery at carpentras southern france 
all this was bound to happen said jean levy a jewish leader 
in lyon the proposals of le pen are so racist his language is 
the point of no return 
after the classroom takeover notin was suspended as an associate 
law professor at the lyon university and asked to resign from its 
science council 
he continued to teach economics however michel noir mayor of 
lyon threatened on april 19 to block the universitys expansion 
into a publicly owned building unless it acted against notin 
that prompted one of notins few public statements he insisted 
on the right of everyone to his liberty of opinion to defy the 
powers that be to criticize and to doubt 
no one accused him of preaching his ideas in class but 
university officials feel he should not have lent the institutions 
name to those ideas 
on may 14 the 48member administration council of jean moulin 
university voted to begin proceedings to dismiss notin it also 
suspended granting a doctorate to georges pinault a lecturer in 
celtic languages who once described adolf hitler as the greatest 
man of the 20th century 
they cant write in the name of history and academic freedom 
that the gas chambers didnt exist noir said in an interview 
these arent opinions they are crimes 
unlike the us constitution which guarantees free speech 
frances charter allows the government to curb expression 
a 1972 law sets fines for racist or antisemitic statements the 
national assembly recently extended it to cover revisionism 
denying the holocaust occurred 
violators would be barred from public jobs or elected office for 
five years le pen who has called the gas chambers a detail of 
history considers the law undemocratic 
who is charged to say what one can and cannot say in a free 
country he asked in an interview as for jews he said if they 
are french theres no problem im not antisemitic 
le pen insists his partys main political targets are immigrants 
daniel drai 25 a softspoken medical student who led the 
invasion of notins classroom said theres only a small 
difference between revisionism and carpentras revisionism erases 
the dead desecration kills them all over again 
for him mayor noir and others a critique of the media that 
appeared under notins name in the august 1989 edition of the 
academic review economy and society fits the description of 
revisionism 
one paragraph says visiting concentration camps is a hardly 
credible way to prove gas chambers existed and describes accounts 
of survivors as hearsay 
indignation over the article eventually led to allegations that 
many members of le pens national front were among the 400 faculty 
of jean moulin university 
at least 10 known members of the party teach there including 
notin and bernard gollnisch a member of the european parliament 
the university which overlooks the rhone river is named for a 
resistance leader tortured to death in lyon in 1943 by the gestapo 
it was born of tensions at the old university of lyon ii during 
the 1968 student upheavals in france 
lyon ii split in 1973 a new leftwing school with the original 
name offered social sciences and rightist jean moulin took 
business finance and law plus history philosophy and languages 
critics say the university was a natural choice when the national 
front sought to broaden its intellectual base colette demaiziere 
dean of french geography history and letters said the criticism 
was overblown and accused noir the mayor of political opportunism 
how can we reproach someone for belonging to a legal party 
she asked weve never been able to prove someone here 
proselytized for the front and if they did im not sure the 
students would respond 
for students sipping soft drinks in the university cloister the 
notin affair took a back seat to impending final exams 
we dont even think about politics said philippe cumunel a 
23yearold finance major theyve put burdens on our backs we 
dont even care about 
cumunel said he saw nothing wrong with firing notin and added to 
nods from others they should get the communists out of here too 
these stalinists who deny the gulag are no better than the nazi 
regime

like many an embattled politician before him 
mikhail s gorbachev took a crack at congress worked his smiling 
way through crowds counterpunched his critics and made the most of 
incumbency 
during his week in the west the soviet president rebuked those 
who call him weak or consider his nation enfeebled by the throes of 
economic change he scolded the american congress for double 
standards and told its leaders they should not meddle in the affairs 
of his legislature 
it was a telegenic combination of grand ceremony and feisty 
politics and it would have played well for an american politician 
in moscow that may not apply in the opposite direction 
the overwhelming soviet concerns are domestic and economic it is 
a time of wrenching change from communism to a market system 
gorbachev said his government is trying to build from the ground up 
it is no easy matter 
it is difficult to be a politician nowadays because a 
politician used to be a guy who sat in his study and was an 
analyst gorbachev told congressional leaders but now one 
cannot divorce himself from the populist sentiments from the 
sentiments of those who do not want to be simple bystanders 
senate and house leaders can understand that they have their 
political problems too but for them it is traveled territory and 
they know the rules in the changing soviet system it is new 
terrain 
gorbachev talked with remarkable candor about his problems in 
what he called a genuine revolution he also warned the west against 
seeking to take advantage of it saying that turmoil in either 
system will mean trouble for the other 
when congressional leaders complained about his clampdown against 
independence in lithuania gorbachev countered with panama 
why do you allow for example your own government your own 
administration to invade panama which is a sovereign country if 
you love freedom so much he demanded 
where were you when panama was invaded and why that double 
standard 
it didnt match the 1959 kitchen debate with which richard m 
nixon as vice president gained political capital in a moscow 
argument with nikita s khrushchev but it had the flavor 
more substantively gorbachev went home from his summit journey 
monday night with a preliminary trade agreement a pact he sought in 
his effort to ease soviet economic problems it is conditional and 
will not take effect before the soviet parliament passes a law 
guaranteeing the right of jewish emigration but he got a deal 
unexpectedly 
in the scoring system of american politics all that should serve 
to strengthen his hand at home at least for a while but those 
rules dont necessarily apply 
nor can the soviet system be measured the old way gorbachev and 
his allies have changed it too drastically that is both their 
achievement and their problem one product of the reformed system is 
the rise of boris n yeltsin gorbachevs leading rival newly but 
narrowly elected president of russia the biggest of the 15 soviet 
republics 
putting a gorbachev spin on that situation vitaly churkin of the 
foreign ministry said in washington that yeltsin might actually turn 
out to be an asset to the central government helping to mobilize 
popular support for radical economic reform 
the administration position is that the united states wants 
perestroika to succeed but that american policy is not tied to 
gorbachev or any other single leader bush advisers keep close watch 
on ups and downs in soviet politics trying to assess what one 
called the blips and instabilities of the situation 
while bush has said that it is not his role to try to sort out 
who should lead the soviet union there is an administration stake 
in gorbachevs survival as leader of the other superpower 
at and after the summit bush emphasized his personal 
relationship with gorbachev he said sunday they have agreed to meet 
on a regular basis perhaps annually the soviet reform policies the 
administration supports are gorbachev policies 
one of bushs top advisors said gorbachev may be as strong as any 
recent leader in terms of kremlin politics 
but administration analysts admit they do not have a good handle 
on the relationship between the old fashioned system of kremlin 
leadership and the new era of political power in the country 
they doubt their soviet counterparts understand it very well 
either

its a tough time of year for television 
executives first there was the may sweeps period now its time 
for the network affiliates annual conventions where the questions 
often come loaded 
sandwiched between were the allimportant fall schedule 
announcements an event tantamount to a presidential candidate 
picking a running mate and not one of the big three wants anything 
in the fall lineup that gets the reception dan quayle got 
so here is robert iger entertainment president of no 2ranked 
abc coming off his first year in his big new job he likes it 
thank you very much even if things are a bit hectic of late 
and almost as much as he likes the job it appears iger likes to 
take chances he calls them gambles where we have nothing to 
lose 
but in the highstakes outofkilter television world there 
always is something to lose most of the time its your job 
the 39yearold former weatherman who now runs programming at abc 
has an affinity for the weird this is the man who brought you 
twin peaks and is about to bring you singing police officers in 
coprock 
this is the man who says i dont believe in being no 1 at all 
costs 
do the guys over at parent company capital cities know this they 
must they put him in this position last march 
igers predecessors include walt disney co chairman michael 
eisner producer fred silverman fox inc chairman barry diller 
and most recently brandon stoddard 
no iger says he doesnt have a quick plan to bump off nbc as 
the toprated network you dont walk in and say were going to be 
no 1 this year 
rather iger says you shoot for innovative programming for 
winning certain time periods for incremental battles that 
eventually add up to winning the war 
so how did iger a 15year abc veteran who came up through its 
sports division devise the upcoming season 
there were time periods we werent going to worry about he 
says 
such as thursdays at 8 when the cosby show is on nbc 
and sundays at 7 when 60 minutes is on cbs 
the time periods abc targeted iger says were saturday and 
wednesday nights to the former it moved china beach and twin 
peaks on the latter night will be the wonder years and 
growing pains 
conversations with iger these days tend to center on twin 
peaks the muchhyped nighttime soap opera created by film 
director david lynch and former hill street blues writer mark 
frost 
most questions about the series that gives new meaning to the 
adjective surreal pertain to why it closed this season without 
solving the murder of homecoming queen laura palmer 
obviously that caused some concern iger says in his century city 
office 
i called mark up that was before we had ever aired the pilot 
i wanted to maximize the shows potential and to do that i thought 
there should be more viewer satisfaction i was pretty forceful 
about it in terms of expressing my thoughts but i never told 
them what to do he says 
iger calls himself a peaks freak and he was the driving 
force in getting the show on the network even when some bigwigs at 
cap cities thought it sounded crazy 
peaks has been picked up for fall despite recent lackluster 
ratings will it do better 
i hope so iger says 
the upcoming season presented a number of problems for abc 
namely what do you put on after americas funniest home videos 
the hottest show on television elvis died there as did other 
programming tries 
igers solution he cloned it in the fall americas funniest 
part ii will be broadcast at 830 pm edt sundays and 
despite a glut of home video hybrids on other networks and local 
affiliates iger said hes not worried about his own show 
i think home videos has proven to be an extremely durable 
product he says 
asked to explain how he decides when to cancel a show that is a 
critical success but a ratings loser iger replies 
its very difficult thats probably one of the most difficult 
things we have to do yes were in this business to be no 1 and 
yes were in this to make money but if a show is still successful 
demographically ie in certain agegroup audiences that cant be 
ignored

louisianas commissioner of agriculture for 32 years and his

old zombies never die they just stagger 
back for remakes 
the flesheaters that grossed out moviegoers in 1969s night 
of the living dead and its two sequels are back as the lowbudget 
black and white horror classic is remade at an abandoned dairy farm 
about 45 miles southwest of pittsburgh 
the remakes plot like the originals is as simple and 
slowmoving as the shuffling dead themselves 
boy meets girl in cemetery boy and girl meet zombie zombie gets 
hungry eats boy girl flees girl crashes mercedes meets other 
survivors in desolate farmhouse many more zombies get hungry 
people in farmhouse nail boards over doors and windows people 
bicker over escape plans zombies descend on farmhouse and break 
through boardedup doors and windows 
this is not a splatter movie its like film noir but its in 
color says rookie director tom savini formerly a special effects 
whiz 
the hue of choice it seems is blood red according to stills 
viewed at the washington county set one of the farmhousebound 
survivors cant cope and eats a shotgun blast a creature deemed 
the autopsy zombie wears a coroners handiwork on his chest and 
another wanders around with a crowbar impaled in his forehead 
even so special effects supervisor john vulich says savini is 
trying to keep the gore to a minimum 
were using the idea that less blood is worth more i think a 
films more scary if its realistic like the girl next door coming 
after you he said 
vulich delights in unsettling visitors with textbook photographs 
of actual gaping wounds his best source material he based the 
makeup of one zombie on a photo of a 14yearold who died when her 
face was caught in an escalator while another was modeled after an 
emaciated survivor at a nazi death camp 
the original night of the living dead cost 130000 and was 
shot using a crew of eight people in evans city another western 
pennsylvania city 
we spend that much in one day now producer russ streiner 
says of the remakes 42 million budget and crew of 100 filming is 
scheduled for completion early this month and a halloween release 
is anticipated for the new night of the living dead 
george romero director of the first dead is keeping a low 
profile as executive producer back to produce are john russo who 
wrote the script and streiner 
director savini says hes concerned the undead seen lurking on 
movie and tv screens these days just dont inspire terror anymore 
the living dead have become comic look at michael jacksons 
thriller or joe piscopo in the beer commercial people laugh at 
that thats not what we want he says 
i dont even like the word zombie it conjures up images of 
voodoo and all that mystical stuff if you look at our script we 
only use the word zombie once we call them the dead people or 
the dead things 
but this remake isnt without touches of comic relief a roving 
band of rednecks revels in taking potshots at the undead blasting 
off their heads 
thats the only way to kill them streiner says 
humor pervades behind the camera as well zombie extras 
staggering across a cow pasture in the films climactic scene 
marched on for coffee but quickly were rounded up for another take 
during latenight shooting 
others plowed into a barbedwire fence before an assistant 
director could yell cut graffiti near a telephone spoofed a 
recent film comedy honey i ate the kids 
locals and traveling horror groupies perched on car and truck 
hoods watching the filming from a nearby ridge the crew says more 
gawkers appear on friday and saturday nights 
ive become jaded as an actor but being out here really 
rejuvenates me says tony todd who plays ben an insurance 
salesmanturnedzombie killer i watch these extras and its so 
important to them its the most major thing theyve done in their 
lives and theyre putting a lot into it 
enthusiasm isnt the only good quality in a dead thing penny 
venners an assistant casting director who narrowed hordes of 
hopefuls from pennsylvania ohio and west virginia down to 150 
extras says it helps to have hollowedout eyes a pale complexion 
and a vacant stare 
the ideal turned up in charles berry 77 a retired paper mill 
worker discovered by savini in a washington diner he didnt even 
need makeup venners says 
clad in a flannel shirt and overalls his white tufts of hair 
streaked back berry showed visitors his zombie walk a slowmotion 
version of the hunchback of notre dame 
my rubber legs help me he says i got them from dancing i 
love to dance 
what started as berrys big break soon became a family plot to 
get all the berrys in the flick including charles sons walter and 
phillip his daughter ludwina and grandson shawn 
ive never seen a zombie movie in my young life charles 
berry says but walter told me to just go ahead and do it 
tim carryer and his wife babs bailey professors of dramatic 
movement at pittsburghs carnegie mellon university were hired to 
teach the zombie shuffle to the berrys and other extras 
if you died and came back to life you would move in a shadow 
of how you once moved carryer says but youre learning to work 
with a brand new body and you dont know how it operates and 
thats difficult 
he encouraged extras to be creative and avoid the zombie cliche 
of walking with stiff legs and extended arms human nature made the 
teaching task easy he says 
i find says carryer theres a little zombie lurking 
inside all of us

editors note its an underground sea of fresh water that 
helped transform the great american desert into fertile farmland 
that last year produced 20 billion worth of food and fiber but can 
the ogallala aquifer survive the onslaught of mans insatiable hand 
on the spigot and chemical barrel maybe yes maybe no

ogallala neb a sign of terrible times on an abandoned sod hut 
in the 1800s on the treeless dry heartless heart of america 
90 miles to wood 20 miles to water gone back east to wifes 
family 
a westbound migrant aglow with his future on the high plains 
this would be fine country if it just had water 
a bitter sodbuster in reply so would hell 
little did they know that only feet below their dusty wagon ruts 
lay an underground ocean one of earths miracles it is called the 
ogallala aquifer 
in its sands and gravel and strata is buried enough fresh water 
to inundate all 50 states beneath almost 1 feet it holds as much 
water as lake huron plus onefifth of lake ontario 
the ogallala stretches from south dakota and wyoming south 
through nebraska which overlies twothirds of its volume 
colorado kansas and oklahoma to texas and new mexico 
once this was all dismissed as the great american desert modern 
irrigation has transformed it into an 800mile green belt made 
possible by in effect upsidedown rain 
the ogallala region today produces up to 40 percent of americas 
beef from 20 percent to 25 percent of its food and fiber notably 
feed grains and cotton this output that helps feed and clothe a 
nation was worth upward of 20 billion in 1989 and fuels an 
ancillary economy that may reach 50 billion 
without irrigation says nebraska sen loran schmit the states 
gross product would drop 70 percent 
during the dust bowls historic drought haggard plainsmen 
watched redeyed as their farms and ranchland blew away in the 
sleepless wind salvation lay but a pipes length beneath their very 
feet but they didnt have the tools to reach it they do now 
irrigation can produce as much as three to four times more than 
dryland farming the ogallala became found money pumping on a 
grand scale began in texas where the high plains became a mammoth 
cotton plantation 
envious farmers peered over their fences at what their irrigating 
neighbors were doing and the practice moved inexorably northward in 
one region of southwest nebraska 111600 acres were irrigated in 
1950 by 1983 973000 acres were in yuma county in northeast 
colorado it was 11000 acres in 1959 446000 in 1987 the lubbock 
texas area had 3627 irrigation wells in 1953 46906 in 1989 
between 1940 and 1980 400 million acrefeet of the ogallalas 
36 billion acrefeet were pumped to the thirsty wells an 
acrefoot covers an acre with 1 foot of water and equals 325848 
gallons the result was predictable 
water levels declined up to 200 feet in texas with 23 percent of 
the water gone as of 1983 kansas has pumped 38 percent of its water 
by one estimate its farmers pumped 44 million acrefeet in 1985 
about 40 million acrefeet remain underground in kit carson county 
in colorado water tables have been dropping up to 5 feet annually 
good rainfall dramatically rising costs of pumping fuel state 
regulation federal farm programs and a greater awareness of 
conservation have combined to stem the flood ground water use 
declined 19 percent from 1980 to 1985 
many echo grain farmer ed ediger of hampton neb lets leave 
some for our grandchildren 
in scott city kan keith lebbin state water district manager 
for westcentral kansas describes the local situation as bleak 
but even something as ancient as agriculture is feeling the effects 
of technology 
new techniques new irrigation devices are coming from of all 
places texas where irrigators used to irrigate most texanly 
innovations there promise to set a pattern that conceivably will 
make the aquifer a selfsustaining resource or at least prolong its 
future unto ed edigers grandchildrens grandchildren 
todays farmer is much better educated about water says bill 
kastner a us geological survey hydrologist 
it took eons for geology and climate to make this national 
treasure in less than a lifetime irrigation has pumped some of it 
dry since world war ii new technology has released a flood far far 
beyond natures dripbydrip ability to replace it 
water thickness in the ogallala ranges from a few feet in kansas 
and colorado to 1300 feet in the nebraska sand hills the average 
is 200 feet perhaps 11 percent of the aquifer has been pumped since 
the late 1930s the maximum decline by 1980 was 200 feet in floyd 
county in the texas panhandle by one estimate a quarter of the 
aquifer will be gone by 2020 
the aquifer has been both mindlessly squandered and utilized with 
great intelligence foresight and selfrestraint 
in places it is also slowly being contaminated in 1987 
nebraska farmers and ranchers put 775000 tons of fertilizer on the 
land and 16500 tons of pesticides and uncounted tons of 
herbicides cows and hogs produced an additional 235000 tons of 
manure gradually quantities of this leached downward toward the 
water 
can the ogallala survive the onslaught of mans insatiable hand 
on the spigot and chemical barrel to be cautiously delphic maybe 
yes maybe no it depends if what can be done will be done it is 
past high noon atop the ogallala but it is not in most places too 
late 
being underground hence invisible aquifers are not readily 
identified nor easily understood once discovered a pioneer in 
nebraska territory could and did hit water digging a post hole he 
can be forgiven for crediting good luck the deity or a forked 
dowsers stick his mindset was local hardly geological wiser 
heads than his had dismissed the regions potential outright 
maj stephen h long explored the high plains in 181920 to utter 
an alltime wowser in the annals of soothsaying 
in regard to this extensive section of the country i do not 
hesitate in giving the opinion that it is almost wholly unfit for 
cultivation and of course uninhabitable by a people depending on 
agriculture for their subsistence

editors note it was once thought of as an elitist clique of 
affluent young white women preoccupied with balls bazaars and 
fashion shows wasp to the max as one puts it but the junior 
league these days is taking some social stands that puts it at odds 
with the conservative establishment and lobbying on capitol hill in 
behalf of the leagues 188000 members is a black woman

bone china and brooches and sterling silver for 
sale special guest rooms at new yorks waldorfastoria cookbooks 
and calligraphy and a fancy private boarding school in the virginia 
hunt country 
its no surprise to find these advertisements in a recent issue 
of the junior league review but theres another side these days to 
the genteel club founded by turnofthecentury debutantes to 
improve the lot of poor children 
more often than not todays league members work full time 
theyre crusading for membership diversity theyve got a black 
lobbyist on capitol hill and theyre promoting things like mandated 
job leaves for new parents pitting themselves against conservatives 
and corporations 
thats not exactly the profile that comes to mind when one thinks 
of the junior league wasp to the max is the more apt 
description given by karen hendricks the lobbyist 
but she is living evidence that league membership is no longer 
reserved for the white uppermiddleincome woman who doesnt work 
outside the home has two kids and a volvo 
nonetheless much work remains if the group is to cast off its 
image as an elitist clique preoccupied with balls bazaars and 
fashion shows 
theres a lot of old baggage sighs hendricks director of 
the leagues 4yearold public policy office in washington 
she knows this firsthand thanks to repeated encounters with 
people who are nonplussed simply by the color of her skin 
once hendricks was waiting to see a senator with two other 
visitors a white woman and a white man an aide arrived and 
approached the white woman 
you must be with the junior league the aide said the woman 
demurred the aide next went over to the white man wrong again it 
finally dawned on her that yes a black person was representing the 
league 
the junior league did not get its whitegloved uppercrust image 
for nothing but members say the substance of the organization has 
been ignored by society reporters less interested in service 
projects than the cookbooks and cotillions that pay for them their 
purpose they maintain is far from frivolous and has not wavered 
since 1901 
that was the year mary harriman sister of the late new york gov 
averell harriman and her friend nathalie henderson founded the 
junior league to aid the slum tenement movement begun by jane 
addams the young women and their debutante friends were in such 
demand as fundraisers and volunteers that by 1907 their mission had 
shifted to a broader goal of neighborhood improvement 
now there are 277 junior leagues with 188000 members in the 
united states canada mexico and great britain under the auspices 
of the association of junior leagues international more than half 
of the active members as opposed to sustainers who have 
graduated at age 45 to different types of community work are 
employed full time 
individual leagues run the gamut from two that have gone on 
record in favor of abortion rights to others that stick to tea and 
symphonies museum programs and historical preservation remain 
hallmarks of some local leagues but others pursue grittier tasks 
that take them into the nations shelters schools hospitals and 
juvenile courts 
they are working with aids babies foster children handicapped 
children the homeless battered women alcoholic women and 
highrisk adolescents they are trying to prevent teenage pregnancy 
and serving as mentors to disadvantaged young girls they have 
founded and staffed child care centers and referral networks they 
are even fighting pollution 
reflecting the times the association has a special program to 
help volunteers translate their skills into paying jobs but the 
greatest shifts in recent years have been efforts to broaden 
membership and develop some lobbying clout 
since forming a diversification committee in 1978 the 
association has been phasing out onerous entry requirements and 
stressing the need to attract minority women 
in the past according to former association president maridel 
moulton of moraga calif leagues could impose a residency 
requirement of any number of years and some sought eight or nine 
sponsors and letters of reference 
the most a league can now require from a prospective member is a 
year of residency and four sponsors who usually serve now as 
mentors rather than gatekeepers incoming members also must be under 
40 and committed to voluntarism 
there are no demographic statistics available so its hard to 
say whether the membership is less white or wealthy as a result of 
the changes according to moulton black women have been members for 
decades but the numbers havent been there you will still 
probably find some junior leagues that have no blacks and there are 
some with a representative number from their communities 
local leagues concerned about foster care prompted the 
association to take its first political positions in 1978 since 
then guided by initiatives from its grass roots the association 
has pressed the federal government on welfare reform civil rights 
child care and other social issues

a staid reputation close community ties and wellplaced 
corporate and political connections make the junior league a valued 
ally 
they are the backbone of uppermiddle class voluntarism they 
bring the stamp of approval of mainstream america says judith 
lichtman president of the womens legal defense fund their women 
represent some of the more establishment sectors of society very 
often they have entree to members of congress that we dont have 
they are truly nonpartisan they dont necessarily just speak to 
progressives or liberals 
the high point nc league brought many of these qualities to 
bear in a successful battle to prevent chemical dumping in a creek 
feeding the citys primary water supply at issue was a permit 
sought by ashland chemical to build an industrial chemical 
repackaging plant 
alerted by water watch a tiny local citizens group league 
members researched ashlands record and the effect of the chemicals 
in question they announced a hearing on the permit in a newspaper 
ad at pta meetings and church suppers in flyers and phone calls 
they even offered to chauffeur people who were afraid to go downtown 
at night 
the publicity was terribly important because most people in 
town were not aware of the danger this particular plant 
represented says june stackhouse acting president of water 
watch we were a small core group of 35 or 40 they had a lot of 
contacts a lot of connections with people with clout they 
helped us pack the hearing and it really paid off 
hendricks attributes much of the leagues effectiveness to who 
people think we are rather than what we do many leagues are at 
the cutting edge of social issues she says despite the persistent 
image of little ladies donating time to innocuous insignificant 
projects 
one illustration of the image gap 
in 1986 the association was pushing for bills to expand the 
federal child care role and require businesses to make unpaid 
jobprotected leaves available to new parents both measures gave 
conservatives apoplexy 
but that was also the year a washington lecture agency advertised 
in the league magazine that it specialized in the unique needs of 
junior league programs with speakers such as charlton heston and 
phyllis schlafly both rockribbed conservatives 
which is not to say a more traditional league wouldnt welcome 
speakers such as heston and schlafly maybe the one in richardson 
texas for example 
the 450member league in a dallas suburb cares for a historic 
home tutors illiterate adults and helps pay for and run a summer 
recreation program for handicapped children recently it sponsored a 
benefit performance by a troupe of disabled puppeteers it also 
gives money to hardpressed community groups serving battered women 
the homeless and others 
what pays for all of this an annual charity ball last year it 
netted 175000 said league president meredith mcclure 
mcclure 37 a parttime administrative assistant with two 
children characterized her members as very conservative and 
said they are not particularly active in politics but she says the 
league is in close touch with the national association and generally 
supports its positions 
the one thing we can always seem to agree on is child 
welfare she says 
mcclure says that even includes support for the federal parental 
leave bill a favorite target of conservatives and the business 
community which cosponsors or underwrites many league projects and 
with which so many members are closely associated 
these women are business owners or are married to business 
owners they can do what they do because of money from business 
hendricks explained 
nevertheless when parental leave came up in the house in may 
hendricks was at the entrance to the chamber grabbing members to 
champion the bill right next to lobbyists from the us chamber of 
commerce and other business groups intent on blocking passage they 
were unsuccessful 
league officials maintain their alliance with feminist and 
medical groups on parental leave is nothing unusual given an 
89year tradition of concern for children and families but they do 
acknowledge an evolution in tactics since the longago day that mary 
harriman walked into a tenement house in new york city 
you start wondering how you can change the system says sally 
orr of new york city a member for nearly 35 years the junior 
leagues realized they had to influence the regulatory and 
legislative process to get changes in their community 
suzanne plihcik of greensboro nc who became president of the 
association in may says political muscle is now very important to 
the leagues mission among the reasons women have less time to 
volunteer while social problems are increasingly broad and complex 
we have looked at more comprehensive and effective approaches 
to doing the same things plihcik says it is imperative that we 
change with the world but our basic values and goals remain the 
same everything is aimed at community improvement

editors note hes seen the money roll in and the money roll 
out hes shed a boozing habit a fear of flying and a shaggy 
toupee pete fountain is still playing the kind of dixieland jazz 
his customers want to hear but all in all hed rather be rich 
</TEXT>

pete fountain still has to blow his clarinet 
for a living and he blames it all on zaps from god 
there pete stands coming up on age 60 short square with white 
goatee and mustache bald as a peeled onion hes fronting a 
sevenman band onstage in a lush saloon and regaling a convention 
crowd with smooth dixieland jazz 
fountain calls it a saloon which is his right since he owns the 
joint nightclub might be a more accurate term 
its a jewel of a bandbox crimson and black with gold trim 500 
seats located in a thriving hotel beside the mississippi river at 
the center of new orleans 
sounds like hes all set right 
but heck you always got a pea under the mattress fountains pea 
is that he has played the stuff the crowd likes thousands of times 
bourbon street up a lazy river pleyels hymn new 
orleans memphis blues basin street blues columbus 
stockade blues the yellow dog bluesand on and on 
all grand old tunes but enough already 
what fountain had rather do is be a millionaire lounging beside 
an olympicsize swimming pool behind a plantation house a cool 
glass of sparkling water in hand no more bourbon please hide that 
vodka no worries if he plays he plays what he likes not what 
the crowd likes 
pete might be relaxing by that pool right now except for a slight 
flaw in character he can lose money faster than he can make it 
during 30 years as a saloon owner slaving over a hot clarinet 
onstage or in a recording studio the money rolled in and the 
money rolled out 
ive made it he says but i have also made some very bad 
investments 
the worst one was the purchase of a handsome hotel overlooking 
the blue gulf of mexico in biloxi miss some 70 miles east of new 
orleans 
i thought owning a hotel would be the greatest thing in the 
world he says then i lost it down the tube 
a chunk of fountain money went into the 1984 new orleans worlds 
fair the fair wound up losing all investor input and about 100 
million besides 
other ventures along the way included a string of convenience 
stores zap there was something called petes wieners and famous 
frozen custard zap 
i could write a book on a lot of the things that i got into 
he said 
i used to say if i had the hotel i could play just one day a 
week but naaah its like you know youre gonna play any time i 
try anything else god zaps me its like he said ive given you 
this talent and damn it youre gonna do it youre gonna play no 
matter what 
fountain was playing with trumepter al hirt in a french quarter 
nightclub 32 years ago when his big break came 
it was a call from of all people lawrence welk a shrewd 
entertainer whose square upright musical style was a joke in the 
jazz circles where pete fountain labored 
would mr fountain bring his clarinet and join the welk band as a 
featured sideman yes indeedy 
maybe it wasnt jazz but the welk musical hour was a top 
television show of that day the audience was in the millions 
you didnt get rich with lawrence welk but you got a lot of 
exposure fountain says and he loves jazz 
he spent two years on the show working jazz clubs on the side 
welk always said he would make my name a household word he 
taught me a little i used to want to play the things i wanted to 
play but i realized you have to play the things that people want to 
hear you play not what you want to hear you play 
fountain has hewed to this philosophy through an output of 85 
record albums three of them achieving gold status and 54 guest 
stints on johnny carsons tv show 
fountain and his band made their fifth command performance for 
the president at a state dinner in washington on april 26 
a popular guy around new orleans fountain has one big annual 
blowout that has become a fixture of mardi gras 
the half fast walking club is a sight to behold as fountain and 
about 150 old buddies put on masks and fancy dress and stagger four 
miles through the tremendous crowd packed along the rex parade route 
in addition to working at his own saloon four nights a week 
fountain and his band do onenight stands at conventions or concerts 
here and there 
to do this he overcame a desperate fear of flying 
friends said the only way you got pete fountain on an airliner in 
the old days was to fill him full of booze carry him on board and 
dump him in his seat like a sack of potatoes 
no more 
you have to travel fast if you want to work fat extra gigs in 
faraway places 
those lucrative extras are even more necessary if your hobby is 
acquiring and caring for classic cars 
if you want to play with the cars the rolls royces and 
different things you have to fly to pay for it fountains says 
im a car junkie a car nut 
in giving up on getting rich fountain also gave up hard likker 
maybe a little wine now and then 
long before he gave up booze fountain gave up hair he snatched 
off his toupee and threw it at the drummer during a stand in las 
vegas 20 years ago 
what happened i wanted to keep up with the kids i got two or 
three toupees made a year each time the hair was a little longer 
it got down over my shoulder i finally realized what the hell am i 
trying to do you cant keep up with these kids so that night in 
vegas i got rid of it it was soaking wet with sweat it was like 
wearing a mop on your head

editors note they are mostly descendants of the tartars the 
golden horde of barbarians that galloped out of the crimea in 
the 13th century to vanquish russia and pillage poland tiny 
enclaves of moslems hang on in overwhelmingly roman catholic poland 
clinging desperately to their ethnic traditions 
</TEXT>

it is possible to face mecca even from 
this remote hamlet hard against the soviet border 
two moslem families live on here tending a tiny wooden mosque 
and a hillside cemetery where gravestones topped with crescent moons 
bear names like kozakiewicz etched in polish and arabic 
the 3000 moslem poles are a littleknown enclave in a noticeably 
homogenous nation now more than 93 percent roman catholic 
but moslems have lived in poland for six centuries and they say 
form the worlds oldest such community in lands never ruled by 
moslems 
most are direct descendants of the tartars who galloped out of 
the crimea vanquished russia and pillaged poland 
the note destroyed by the tartars describes monument after 
monument in polish guidebooks and polish radio plays daily the 
brokenoff call of a krakow trumpeter sounding the alarm of a tartar 
attack before being felled by an arrow to the throat 
every schoolchild learns the date april 9 1241 when the 
tartars first conquest of poland reached as far west as legnica 
130 miles from berlin the battle there left the most powerful 
polish prince henryk the pious chopped into so many pieces it is 
said his mother could only identify him by the six toes on one foot 
this onslaught of the golden horde left a terror of barbarian 
invaders from the east that echoes through polish political life to 
this day 
but when the tartars did not battle the poles they fought 
alongside them helping defend poland against every invader from the 
teutonic knights at grunwald in 1410 to the germans in 1939 
i am polish of moslem background emphasizes ali popluwski 
hobbled by a german bullet to his leg inflicted while the occupiers 
turned the kruszyniany mosque into a world war ii field hospital 
popluwski is the mosque caretaker but there is no imam or 
religious leader anymore one comes to lead prayers on the highest 
holidays from bialystok a city an hour away where the several 
hundred moslems hold services in an apartment living room 
more frequent are the tourists visits up to 1000 a day on 
holidays they are mainly the middle east arabs who shunned 
elsewhere were particularly welcome in poland while its communist 
regime snubbed the west 
some set up tents in nearby cow pastures but most come and go in 
glossy foreign cars bumping down the singlelane dirt and cobbled 
lane after leaving their polish brethren a little money on a silver 
tray 
it is enough to keep the mosque in prayer rugs but not to 
fulfill the life wish of a 77yearold moslem trying to mind his 
religious heritage in a village of a couple of dozen farmers without 
phones or indoor plumbing 144 miles east of warsaw 
everybody dreams of going to mecca but you need 2000 green 
ones us dollars to go to mecca not red money popluwski says 
still he proudly thumbs the register of visitors many bringing 
messages from the holy city he has seen seven thick books filled 
i hope someone will maintain the tradition when i go he says 
there are only two other mosques in poland one is equally 
remote tiny and wooden also dating to the 1670s and located in 
the nearby border village of bohoniki where five or six moslem 
families remain 
the other opened this spring in gdansk made possible by the 
donations of arab students and funds raised by organizing trips to 
turkey for poles who go to trade not tour 
the new mosque the first in the country for nearly 200 years is 
less a sign of a resurgent community than of the determination of 
the 120 or so moslems who settled in the baltic port city as postwar 
refugees from sovietannexed eastern poland 
the stalindrawn border cut through a cluster of moslem villages 
in what had been eastern poland leaving all but kruszyniany and 
bohoniki in the soviet union 
many moslems were deported with other poles to siberia but 
others fled west into modern poland by 1947 they had held their 
first registration counting 1100 from a prewar population of about 
5500 
a moslem historian who participated in the first postwar count in 
gdansk wont allow his name to be used hes tired he says of 
having his faith treated as an exotic curiosity in poland but he 
speaks proudly of his peoples accomplishments against the odds of 
religious and political repression 
tartars many prisoners of war began to settle polish lands 
during the 15th century becoming loyal subjects of their adopted 
kings largely through royal reward for military service they began 
to accumulate wealth land and the civic rights of the nobility 
writes warsaw universitys jan tyszkiewicz 
but poverty set in during the 16th century when a law was passed 
barring nonchristion landowners from having christian serfs 
tartars had to sell off their lands many sought military 
careers or entered professions or trade living on as an 
identifiable community through polands disappearance from the map 
at the end of the 18th century 
living under the russians through the 19th century moslems 
suffered with the rest of the polish nation in the graveyard at 
kruszyniany the headstones of moslem poles who died during the 
1800s are written as required by law in russian cyrillic letters 
many moslem and arabic texts including the koran were 
translated into polish and lithuanian but the ability to speak the 
tartar tongue was largely lost 
there are very big difficulties because the moslems in poland 
have been cut off from contacts with the moslem world for 300 
years the gdansk historian said 
in kruszyniany the golden horde cafe is closed and arabic 
writing on the bus ticket kiosk has been painted over popluwskis 
granddaughter has moved with her mother to bialystok where she can 
learn moslem traditions 
but in warsaw where 150 to 200 moslems live a blueprint for a 
mosque has been drawn and construction is to start this year funds 
permitting 
and in gdansk the historian is optimistic the centuries of 
moslem tradition will continue in poland 
unquestionably i am convinced it will survive he said 
the traditions are very highly developed this tradition once was 
connected with noblemen and now it is more connected with ethnic 
pride

dawnn lewis star of nbcs a different 
world got her start on the show writing the lyrics for the theme 
song 
the composer stu gardner didnt know me as an actress says 
lewis who broke into show business singing jingles for commercials 
when i auditioned for the role i didnt tell them i cowrote the 
theme until i was hired 
she also has been asked to sing the national anthem at the world 
series provided the san diego padres win the national league 
pennant first 
that invitation came from tom werner the teams new owner and 
partner in carseywerner the production team that created a 
different world 
lewis plays jaleesa vinson an older divorced student at 
fictional hillman college who got her degree at the end of the 
season 
she says she doesnt know what her graduation means for jaleesas 
future 
whether that means i come back as a graduate student or a 
teacher or get a job hasnt been decided she says were 
getting some new writers and well meet with them in the summer to 
talk about our characters 
lewis is the only member of the cast from the pilot whos still 
with the show it made its debut three years ago as a spinoff of 
the cosby show starring lisa bonet 
bonet married to musician lenny kravitz left at the end of the 
first season when she became pregnant and has since returned to the 
bill cosby show 
the show also stars jasmine guy as a spoiled debutante plus 
kadeem hardison cree summer charnele brown darryl bell glynn 
turman sinbad and lou myers 
jaleesa is honest young at heart sassy and always has 
something to say about someone elses opinion lewis says she 
makes comments that you cant get mad about because theyre true 
jaleesas in focus she has a game plan she wants to be 
stylish although she doesnt always hit the mark 
lewis grew up in brooklyn and during high school rode the subway 
for an hour and 20 minutes every day to attend new yorks high 
school of music and art in harlem 
id get to school an hour early she says id meet my 
friends for breakfast and no matter how early i got there i was 
always late for my first class 
she was accepted by several colleges but chose the university of 
miami and graduated magna cum laude in 1982 with a degree in music 
i applied to brooklyn college to please my parents she says 
i graduated from high school when i was 16 and i wanted to leave 
new york the temptation to get a job was too strong if i stayed 
there so i wanted to get away my grandmother had recently moved to 
miami so that made it easier on my parents 
i was miamis first musical graduate she says 
i was the kind of kid who would figure out something and make 
it work you couldnt tell me i couldnt do it 
although lewis lives in los angeles where she is active in 
community volunteer work she still considers new york her home she 
has bought a house here and is working on music for a new album 
i thought when i came here that being on television would be my 
biggest adjustment she says just being here is the biggest 
adjustment im not an la person its so different the energys 
different 
the standards are different a 16yearold here can have a car 
at 16 i was worried about having enough tokens for the bus and 
subway 
and coming here as a celebrity makes it even harder because you 
have to fit into a mold you have to drive the right kind of car 
you have to see the right people you have to say the right thing

the miracle to hear eileen atkins describe it is 
that she succeeded as an actress at all 
its incredibly hard and i dont care what anybody says for 
people from my kind of background to get into the theater and become 
a classical actress says the british star of prin currently 
playing offbroadway at the manhattan theater club 
that background refers to the british workingclass atkinss 
father read gas meters her mother made dresses to both her 
parents acting meant entertainment in the most lowbrow sense not 
the meaty wideranging roles that have distinguished her career 
my mother wanted me to be a chorus girl because i tapdanced 
she recalls when i got to 12 and said im going to do 
shakespeare people thought i was crackers 
more than 40 years later the jokes on them a veteran of 
broadway and the west end last year she won londons equivalent of 
the tony award for her performances in shakespeares cymbeline 
and harold pinters mountain language at the royal national 
theater 
at 55 atkins belongs to that world class of british actresses 
that includes vanessa redgrave glenda jackson judi dench and 
maggie smith she shares with them a distinctively unglamorous 
british beauty face sharp and angular eyes suggesting inner 
strength and wisdom 
how did she reach the top sheer bloody obstinacy she says 
and a teacher named mr burton 
my mother sent me with a note to school saying i would do 
better if i spoke nicely as she put it atkins recalls 
the main drama teacher wanted 7 shillings and sixpence a week 
then about 250 to iron out young eileens cockney accent 
my mother said we cant afford it this man caught hold of 
me in the corridor and said ill teach you for nothing if you come 
whenever i tell you to and stay for as long as i want you to and 
theres no argument about anything she said 
atkins spent an hour after school with mr burton for the next 
five years and he first took her to the legitimate theater today 
her voice betrays no trace of her roots she has lost touch with 
burton and as far as she knows he has never come to see her on 
stage 
in prin by andrew davies atkins plays a lesbian 
headmistress of a womens teacher training college whose exacting 
idealism brings about her collapse 
sheila hancock won acclaim and an olivier award nomination for 
originating the role in the west end last winter but atkins plans a 
fresh approach i cannot bear playing something i have seen 
somebody do she says 
she says she has heard prin dismissed as a cross between 
the prime of miss jean brodie about an autocratic scottish 
teacher and the killing of sister george the play that broke 
the taboo on portraying lesbianism on the british stage 
but she remains fascinated by the title characters mixture of 
charisma and cruelty 
she only cares about standards about going for the 
truthsome people wont like her and some people will but im 
certainly not going to woo the audience to like me 
atkins hasnt acted in the united states since her harrowing 
performance as the schizophrenic mary barnes at the long wharf 
theater in new haven conn in 1980 
she has appeared four times on broadway starting with her 1966 
debut in the killing of sister george opposite beryl reid that 
role earned her a tony nomination for best actress as did her 
elizabeth i to claire blooms mary queen of scots in the 1972 
vivat vivat regina 
atkins has consciously eschewed stardom preferring british 
repertory to star vehicles and passing up the chance to act in 
upstairs downstairs the acclaimed television series that she 
and jean marsh cocreated 
she was the producers first choice for the part of sarah the 
maid which made a star out of pauline collins atkins doesnt 
regret it 
you get known as hudson or rose and then it takes you forever 
to get out of it again she says 
i would find it boring to play the same part continuously for a 
long time 
to me the interesting thing about work is finding the 
character and the rehearsal i like licking each part and once 
youve done that all you have left is learning it every week 
film roles have included vivid supporting performances in 
equus 1977 and the dresser 1983 but she lost a part in 
room with a view to her friend judi dench 
i didnt really think about the cinema when i was young 
because if you looked like me you werent a film star she says 
i was brought up to think i was extremely plain now i look 
back and say youre adorable 
her selfdeprecating manner drops only once when she gloats 
about finally getting a driving license 
its pretty good at 55 to learn to drive she says i think 
im prouder of that than anything

metamorphosen duetconcertino for clarinet amp bassoon prelude to 
capriccio op 85 by richard strauss cbs new stockholm chamber 
orchestra conducted by esapekka salonen paul meyer clarinet 
knut sonstevold bassoon 
strauss 18641949 wrote these works in the 1940s during the 
last decade of his life long gone were the years of his tremendous 
success as an opera composer his reputation as a master of 
everincreasing orchestation his fame as a conductor and even his 
decline in critical opinion into a composer of mere talent and no 
longer genius 
john cage was in his 30s arnold schoenberg was in his 60s and 
70s and music being composed at the time bore little resemblance to 
the early world of strauss who began writing music when the giants 
were brahms saintsaen dvorak tchaikovsky and bruckner 
in these last years strauss didnt change nor did the power of 
his music 
the metamorphosen are a distillation of his swirling lush 
romantic style the funeral march from beethovens eroica symphony 
appears throughout and at the end of the score strauss wrote in 
memoriam presumably for a destroyed germany 
salonen produces a sinewy subtle interpretation of this work of 
extraordinary richness and intensity he suddenly lifts out a brief 
line and puts it back in favor of another the dynamic range is 
broad though the recorded sound somewhat dry 
the duetconcertino is a rarely heard gem its sunny airy 
quality provides a nice contrast the soloists play freely and with 
an openness of character the prelude to capriccio strauss final 
opera serves as a nice reconciliation of the metamorphoses 
intensity and the duets lightness we are back to the style of der 
rosenkavalier a clear reminder of a different world

songs for drella sire lou reed and john cale 
 
lou reed and john cales songs for drella is the rare rock 
performance that would sound more appropriate in a drawing room or 
theater than on an album 
the two former members of the velvet underground were 
commissioned to honor andy warhol their artistic coconspirator in 
the 1960s they returned with a 15song tribute that is part 
brilliant part aggravating and always compelling 
its a tribute without tears like theater it works far better 
as a single musical piece to be experienced in one sitting than on a 
disc that can be returned to frequently 
songs for drella loosely chronicles warhols life and the 
artists influence on the velvets from the explosive creativity in 
the 1960s to the disillusionment of warhols final years enough 
artistic license is taken for reed and cale to label the work a 
fiction 
the best moments are the two reed songs that bookend the disc 
small town describes an artists young life in a town he yearned 
to escape the album closes with reed figuratively standing over 
warhols grave he admits to resentments that can never be 
unmade but expresses the universal wish hed talked more with his 
friend while he was still alive 
musically the limited palette used by reed and cale does not 
invite repeated listenings the instrumentation is essentially 
guitar and keyboard with a few added colorings neither red nor 
cale is a strong or expressive singer and their deliveries are 
sometimes deadening 
one consumer note with records dying heres a good example of 
the type of creative cd packaging that could stop any pining for 
album covers its a handsome grouping of words and pictures with 
sharp black packaging the cd itself is set apart as a fluorescent 
portrait of warhol it looks terrific

forget all those highflown comments about the 
joys of directing movies now hear plaintalking bob hoskins its 
like being pecked to death by a thousand pigeons 
the london actor makes his directorial bow with the raggedy 
rawney which drew mixed reviews in new york and now is being 
released slowly across the country 
it wasnt my idea says hoskins i was in australia and 
the producer bob weis was talking about ideas for films i told 
him the old gypsy legend i think from the 100 years war i told him 
the story and said this would make a good film 
he leapt up in the air and said right give me a script 
youll direct it well do it in czechoslovakia i said oh will 
we it all came about through nepotism hes a close friend of 
mine and the crew was all family close friends 
hoskins and nicole de wilde wrote the script concerning a young 
soldier who deserts in wartime and joins a band of gypsies 
disguising himself as a rawney a gypsy term for a halfwit with 
unusual powers george harrisons handmade films provided the 5 
million budget and hoskins and crew went off to czechoslovakia for 
the filming 
hoskins who had done some directing in the theater was not 
fazed by the tight budget you can film an epic if you can figure 
out a way of doing it he reasoned for instance he staged a 
horse race in a small yard by carefully selecting camera angles 
concerning his pecked to death comment everybodys got 
questions for you they follow you into the loo toilet theyre 
banging on the door what pair of shoes dya want i dunno wear 
the shoes that fit ya 
theres no break at all the minute you get up questions they 
go on all the time some cant do their job until theyve had an 
answer from you 
he partly solved the problem when the cast presented him with a 
hat that was marked actor on one side and director on the 
other when i wore the actor side the crew wasnt allowed to 
ask me questions said hoskins who plays the leader of the gypsy 
band 
the raggedy rawney was filmed before the velvet 
revolution toppled communist rule hoskins and the rest of the 
company came to admire the czechs who worked on the film but they 
recognized certain barriers 
my translator was a wonderful guy who translated into czech 
three words behind me said hoskins sometimes i would go on 
about the regime and he said to me bob dont say those things in 
front of me im supposed to report you and if i dont theyre 
going to report me so we figured out that every time i wanted to 
say something id scratch my head and wed go for a walk 
one factor helped hoskins survive the hard days of filming 
great beer there wonderful beer i asked the guy who picked the 
locations how come theres always a really good bar near these 
places and there was great beer thats where the original 
budweiser comes from 
bob hoskins was born in suffolk on oct 16 1942 and his parents 
moved to london two weeks later just in time for a german bombing 
his life has been somewhat rambunctious ever since he quit school 
at 15 wandered from job to job until he happened into an acting 
audition by mistake he won a lead role and he hasnt stopped 
working 
while his fellow actors boast of training at drama academies 
hoskins says i actually learned from watching women i never had 
a class or was taught to act what i realized was that women have 
had to keep their mouths shut for thousands of years but they can 
express themselves very clearly without saying a word 
but a guy always hides what drama is is about the private 
moment its very difficult for a man to show the private moment 
its got nothing to do with femininity its a language i wouldnt 
say a body language its just a language telepathy maybe 
hoskins has had a busy schedule he has finished mermaids 
with cher and a thriller shattered and next plays a detective 
in plastic nightmare with tom berenger most of his work has 
been in this country but he declines to change his london base 
i couldnt take the kids away from their grandparents 
he commented ruefully that his wife dislikes his many absences 
and his kids rosa 6 and jack 4 are beginning to call me 
uncle 
though nominated for an academy award for his work in mona 
lisa hoskins most successful film has been the blockbusting 
who framed roger rabbit 
will he be around for a sequel 
i dont think they disney will make one it was wonderful an 
experience i wouldnt miss for the world but to do it again by the 
time we finished everyone was on their knees oh that was tough

these days its possible to find public school students getting

alarmed at the slow pace of school reform big business and 
educators are putting aside longstanding suspicions to join in 
common cause to help students become the intelligent productive 
workers the nation needs to remain competitive 
but this evercloser relationship is posing tough choices for 
educators perhaps nowhere more so than in the area of curriculum 
scores of corporations labor unions and other outside groups 
no one knows exactly how many are making tempting offers of 
curricular materials to schools either free or at a nominal charge 
the catch is that such materials sometimes amount to free 
advertising may contain subtle propaganda or simply do not fit the 
educational goals or objectives of a given school or school district 
some critics worry that schools are becoming marketplaces for 
commercial messages not ideas 
among the most recent offerings a curriculum on labor history by 
the united auto workers and a flashy educational video called car 
smart by atlantic richfield arco featuring stars like olivia 
newtonjohn and melissa gilbert urging students to fight pollution 
by driving less maintaining cars carefully and traveling light 
another hot new offering is a brochure how to enjoy a 
symphony issued by hershey chocolate usa designed to help 
youngsters enjoy their first musical encounters 
not coincidentally the brochure bears the name of hersheys new 
symphony candy bar 
the debate intensified earlier this year when channel one began 
beaming educational newscasts into thousands of classrooms around 
the country whittle communications which produced the programming 
offered schools free video equipment schools for their part had 
to guarantee students would watch it commercials and all 
arthur lebowitz principal of south mountain high school in 
phoenix says his school had explored using channel one but we 
have been reluctant to pursue that because we have to obligate a 
certain amount of class time 
but his school is using an applied economics curriculum plugging 
the theme of free enterprise put out by junior achievement 
there are some curricula that are downright misleading and we 
have urged schools to be very very cautious in adopting them 
says gordon cawelti executive director of the association for 
supervision and curriculum development which recently recommended 
guidelines to help schools choose 
according to ascd schools should be sure that any such material 
is consistent with the values goals and objectives of the 
educational program 
responds to a clearly understood educational need 
supports and does not undermine implicity or explicitly an 
existing curriculum and instruction message 
has been considered and assessed by groups with different 
views 
daniel merenda executive director of the national association of 
partners in education which fosters schoolbusiness partnerships 
adds this caution our premise is that materials should be 
developed jointly with teachers so that you take the question of 
bias out of it 
some businessgenerated curricula are considered excellent and 
have caught on phenomenally pizza huts threeyearold book it 
is a reading incentive program for grades one through six 
dr carolyn hughes oklahoma citys assistant superintendent in 
charge of curriculum and program development says the district 
generally shys from using corporateproduced curricula 
just because its free doesnt mean were going to use it 
she says 
but book it is a welcome exception in her district 
it obviously has marketing value but it does motivate kids to 
read she says 
more recently more than 20000 public schools have snapped up 
the healthy choices for young americans curriculum offered two 
months ago free of charge by the washington state apple commission 
at the 9th street elementary school in los angeles for example 
fourthgrade teacher mike romero is using that curriculum to get his 
pupils to keep food journals brush their teeth after meals and do 
situps and other exercises 
in tulsa okla amoco has for years supplied local elementary 
and middle schools with science curricula aimed at promoting 
experimentation 
utility companies were early pioneers in developing curricula 
not always to universal applause 
in 1979 a book titled hucksters in the classrooms by sheila 
harty criticized corporations including utility companies for 
offering schools onesided propagandistic lessons 
since then utilities have learned some lessons says janet 
white educational services representative of the edison electric 
institute in washington 
the curricula we are most proud of are developed cooperatively 
with the utility being one player along with the state department 
of education or school district says white 
for example pennsylvania power and light worked with an advisory 
panel of teachers to develop a power concepts curriculum for 
kindergarten through 12th grade it includes lessons in how to 
measure energy the pros and cons of different energy options 
including nuclear energy its designed to fit into existing general 
science curricula 
likewise puget sound power and light in washington state and 
boston edison in massachusetts have worked with educators to develop 
environmental curricula 
even though such corporatesponsored curricula have improved in 
recent years critics like harty still counsel caution 
we must take precautions now to curb commercial exploitation in 
the schools lest our schools fall farther and farther from their 
intellectual and social purposes harty wrote earlier this year 
do we really want the jolly green giant teaching nutrition reddy 
kilowatt teaching energy and chemical companies teaching about the 
environment

ask marilyn alberts what she does for a 
living and she sounds like an agent for novelists nobelists and 
poet laureates 
she is an english teacher who is convinced that all of her 
classes are filled with the greatest minds in the world 
i come to school every day and i read the greatest works that 
have ever been written about the greatest ideas that people deal 
with love honor death pain sharing gratitude with people 
who are interesting and intelligent and happen at the moment to be 
17 years old she says 
i should trade this for a computer a bank tellers job a set 
of law books whatever for mere money please 
alberts a fast talker with a sense of humor developed this 
formula answer while at a cocktail party when someone 
discovered i was a high school teacher and was quickly looking for 
an exit to find someone more interesting 
she teaches 11th and 12thgrade students at bethesdachevy chase 
high school in a washington dc suburb in april she received an 
honorary doctorate of humane letters from georgetown university 
after being nominated by 16 of her former students who are now 
undergraduates there 
i dont think the teacher teaches the students says alberts 
whose gray hair forms bangs that give her a youthful look i think 
its a community of scholars thats the phrase i like to use with 
the kids at the beginning of the year 
i also tell the kids at the beginning of class i will come to 
know who you were as you grew because of what you write about 
but i also have a sense of who you will become this is a continuum 
you are the whole person that is both past present and future 
thats why its nice when the future comes back and says 
see she says of the georgetown honor 
alberts began working at bethesdachevy chase in 1978 and teaches 
english advanced composition and advanced placement english this 
year she teaches all honors classes and she is not too happy about 
it 
i think its important to teach every level in the 
curriculum she says i dont think you should get far away from 
that for longer than a year 
but she enjoys working with juniors and seniors 
they are finally willing to be free of that early adolescent 
need to be like everybody else she says they really are 
tentatively ready to trust themselves not to do that its fun to 
watch them come out of that 
and she likes watching people learn to express themselves 
from the class scholars to frankly the ones who may not make it 
out of school 
i know that sometime in that semester every person will write 
at least one good line of poetry she says raising her forefinger 
for emphasis it just has to happen if you can speak words its 
going to happen at some point it always does 
alberts was inspired to teach by a high school english teacher 
who cried over a poem during class 
we were all crucified with embarrassment for her she says of 
that experience which later led her to write a poem but what 
could i do but become an english teacher too 
bethesdachevy chase is one of the oldest high schools in 
montgomery county md and the english curriculum is 
literaturebased classwork includes discussions of shakespearean 
plays greek tragedies and other classics 
while seniors work mainly on essays and poetry juniors focus on 
drama and fiction it is in the junior year when students learn how 
to write collegequality papers she says 
while alberts will not use abridgements or easy versions of 
the classical works she is working to expand the canon by 
including more works by women and minorities 
alberts seldom uses the word wrong and often allows students 
to express their opinions as long as they can thoroughly support 
their view 
some of the best work comes from students who dont do well in 
english she says explaining that those students usually have 
trouble with sequential or logical material but are clearly 
imaginative 
all of a sudden he hits this class and he puts these crazy 
things together things that in the past teachers have said no 
thats crazy youre not logical and i say god thats 
wonderful 
chuckling at the thought alberts denies that her expectations 
alone spurred the student to excel its there to be discovered 
the biggest disappointment for alberts is knowing youve lost a 
few 
if reality werent reality youd hope you could save them 
all she says there is always a sense of whoever didnt become 
all he or she could be and if you could have done anything to change 
that 
alberts grew up in sacramento calif her mother now 93 was a 
teacher in a oneroom schoolhouse in patterson calif her father 
was general secretary of the ymca she received a bachelors degree 
in english from the university of california at berkeley and was a 
fellow of the national endowment for the humanities at stanford 
university in 1986 
over the years alberts teaching style has changed 
i certainly was a lot more directive as a teacher than i am 
now she says my preferred method now is to work with a book 
that i have not read or not made up my mind about i read it at the 
same time the kids do we really do deal with it together as a 
community of scholars 
i think im less judgmental than i used to be i used to say 
this is what you should learn and i will test you on it i think 
thats a means to an end now its not an end in itself

daniel a california teenager was performing down to 
expectations when he started high school his typical grades on 
tests and report cards were ds and a few fs just what his middle 
school teachers had warned his high school teachers to anticipate 
but what they didnt look for is that on standardized test 
scores daniel not his real name performed at 12thgrade level in 
english and 10thgrade level in mathematics his grades obviously 
didnt match his intelligence 
the school counselor was asked to step in to find out why he 
discovered that the boys mother had a handsoff attitude about her 
sons schooling and that daniel had such low selfesteem that his 
laziness and poor grades seemed to be a way of telling himself that 
he was no good 
building success is really the parents job says darryl t 
yagi counselor at the casa grande high school in petaluma who has 
been named counselor of the year by the american school counselors 
association they should have expectations of the kids a lot of 
times the parents wont do this 
yagi who also serves as counseling advisor to the sylvan 
learning centers says that sometimes parents think the school will 
take care of all learning problems but sooner or later they have 
to acknowledge that a problem exists 
the counselor is in a really good position to help because he 
can call on a body of resources says yagi he knows how to get 
help from school staff community agencies and the parents among 
others to identify the problems and recommend solutions at the 
same time he serves as a nonjudgmental and nonemotional 
intermediary for the student 
kids respond to the counselor because he can tell them how to 
recognize and deal with problems the kids feel good about 
themselves 
in daniels case the counselor pointed out the high test scores 
to him then worked with both the youngster and his mother to raise 
their expectations of his abilities he was enrolled in a 
prealgebra class far more complicated than the general math class 
he had been failing with this more positive view of himself he 
improved his work habits and took on even more challenging 
assignments 
the counselor can be a key figure in turnarounds like this one 
and yagi says that it usually takes only two or three visits with a 
student before the problems tend to take care of themselves 
the student whose confidences are respected may initiate the 
consultations a request for help also might come from a teacher or 
parent whos too closely involved and needs a disinterested third 
party to help a child put a problem into perspective 
the mother of a girl yagi calls tina was concerned about the 
slipping grades of her freshman daughter because she knew she was 
upset about the fathers disability from a recent illness tinas 
mother asked the counselor to intervene without letting tina know 
who suggested it the counselor helped tina realize that she 
wouldnt lose control of her life like her father and that she could 
get on with her schooling and her future 
school counselors usually have a background in psychology or 
social sciences yagi says they should be good communicators and 
knowledgeable about resources available in the community at school 
and at home that can be brought into play for problem solving they 
also should be able to recognize when longterm attention such as 
psychotherapy is appropriate and recommend it 
at lower grade levels one counselor will be responsible to 500 
students and in high school the ratio narrows to one for 400 
yagi says most problems seem to occur at transitional points 
the first grade the first year in junior high or high school or 
when the curricula changes its usually a combination of academic 
concern peer pressure the family situation and other changes the 
student is changing personally psychologically and emotionally 
as he or she develops and grows 
warning signs for parents include when the child has poor 
selfesteem doesnt do homework or the work at school or gets into 
the wrong crowd and drifts into behavior problems 
yagi wrote a pamphlet how to talk to your school counselor 
for sylvan a national group of supplemental learning centers that 
has developed tests and educational services for exceptional 
students or those with learning deficiencies

keeping good teachers is simple say two 
academics whove studied the problem of faculty turnover pay them 
more 
keeping good math and science teachers is simple too pay them 
even more than that 
the lesson is very simple if we want good teachers 
particularly in science and math we have to raise their salaries 
says randall j olsen professor of economics and director of ohio 
state universitys center for human resource research 
olsen and richard j murname a harvard professor were 
coauthors of a study of schools in three states that appeared in 
the american economic review they examined records of nearly 18000 
teachers in colorado michigan and north carolina who began their 
careers in the 1970s 
they found that high school chemistry and physics teachers had 
the shortest schoolroom careers in michigan for example they 
stayed only an average of 49 years and mathemathics teachers were 
next averaging 74 years in the classroom before quitting 
elementary school teachers stayed longest 164 years 
science and mathematics teachers often have better job 
opportunities outside the classroom so theyre more likely to move 
elementary school teachers and those who arent specialized dont 
always have those oppiortunities says olsen 
the researchers say that similar results were found in colorado 
and north carolina 
olsen admits that the idea of paying science and math teachers 
more than others who teach social studies or elementary grades may 
not be popular with teachers unions but he says the fact is that 
science and math teachers show a greater willingness to leave 
teaching for betterpaying jobs in industry and are the least likely 
to return to the classroom later

is more than popular wisdom says a kings college professor whos 
made a study of their habits and academic records 
charles i brooks a psychology professor studied 283 women and 
312 men in his introductory psychology classes over a sixyear 
period and found that women miss fewer classes sit closer to the 
front and make better grades 
he found that 71 percent of the women sat in the first four rows 
compared with 44 percent of the men 70 percent of the women had 
four class cuts or fewer during the term compared with 54 percent 
of the men and the women made better grades on the whole than the 
men women in the second row averaged close to a b while men in the

if youve ever been assigned a college 
roommate by the luck of the draw you know the meaning of odd 
lots 
freshmen enrolling in wilson college sign contracts with their 
roommates at the beginning of the term to avoid conflicts 
the roommate contracts force students to sit down and talk 
about things they wouldnt discuss otherwise says margie taylor 
spokeswoman for wilson a liberal arts college for women 
students typically discuss how they feel about smoking visitors 
privacy study time and borrowing each others clothes or how the 
room will be arranged and which cleaning chores will go to whom 
taylor says that many students have never lived with another 
person outside the family before and they often make the mistake of 
being too polite about little annoyances until the problems build up 
the contracts get a lot of stuff laid out ahead of time she 
says 
students also discuss how they feel about issues like sex 
alcohol religion and which odd couple character they most 
resemble the fastidious felix unger or the sloppy oscar madison 
they end by listing issues they agree on topics that need further 
discussion and subjects on which they will agree to disagree 
kathy boyd a communications major who graduated last year says 
the agreement saved her a lot of grief my roommate was my best 
friend from high school but i was afraid that we could destroy our 
friendship by living together in college im a felix and shes an 
oscar the contracts provided a good framework to live by she 
and her roommate angela spahr a fine arts major agreed not to 
share clothes but to do laundry together to save money 
the success of the contract really comes down to communication 
skills and we do a lot of things in both academic and student life 
to build those skills says taylor

until students adopt good study habits theyre not going to 
learn a thing no matter how they stare at the book says a chicago 
learning executive 
too many parents see their child hunched over an open book and 
assume he is learning says robert baseman president of american 
learning corp but often just the opposite is true 
he doesnt have to have the radio or television on to have his 
attention drift away from his reading 
american learning a division of encyclopaedia brittanica inc 
operates brittanica learning centers which offer individualized 
instruction in reading and math 
baseman offers some study habit tips that he says can improve 
grades in school and increase the level of learning by 20 to 30 
percent 
establish a goal to focus on daily either in writing it 
reading it or saying it aloud 
set aside certain hours just for studying avoid late hours or 
study times right after meals morning hours or right after classes 
are the best for learning 
eliminate distractions and thoughts about other interests or 
activities study in a quiet place dont study if youre hungry or 
thirsty 
take rest periods short fiveminute breaks are good if youre 
working on one set task otherwise 10 or 15minute breaks are 
refreshing do something physical on your break 
chart your progress 
work as quickly as reasonable while concentrating and focusing 
on what you are doing 
reread the notes you took in class the same day you took them 
while they are still fresh in your memory 
developing good study habits should be a joint effort of child 
and parent baseman says

a loyola university professor suggests that students preparing to 
study abroad should also consider what it will be like to come back 
home 
more students have problems with culture shock and readjustment 
when they return than when they begin their study abroad says 
michael cornet professor of communications who has traveled 
extensively in europe and taught for two years at loyolas rome 
center campus 
tourists especially if theyre only in europe for a short 
period of time dont generally experience the culture shock that 
many students go through upon their return to the united states 
he says 
part of the reason he says is that most other people arent 
very interested in hearing the details of the trip either their 
family and friends are looking for a pat it was nice answer or 
they want an excuse to tell about their own european adventures 
he says 
the returning students often dont have anyone to share their 
experience with and many realize how much they have grown up in 
comparison with their peers says cornett 
still cornett is a strong advocate of study abroad programs 
it gives students a unique opportunity to examine their own 
relationships goals and interests he says

back to school can often mean back to minor health problems for 
children but its nothing parents should worry about says the 
chief of pediatrics at a new york hospital 
many school children go through a period of getting sick again 
after a relatively healthy summer says dr joseph abularrage of 
new york infirmarybeekman downtown hospital this is because 
school and day care programs put children in big groups in confined 
areas unlike their comparatively open surroundings in the summer 
the result is often a mild cold or other easily transmitted minor 
health problem he says 
abularrage says a healthy diet and plenty of rest are the best 
ways to prevent minor illnesses like the common cold but parents 
should be sure to have their children vaccinated 
parents may also have to deal with school phobia if a 
youngster is extremely fearful of going to school and does 
everything to resist going abularrage says the best way to 
handle the situation is to work out the problems of separation 
anxiety very slowly with the child perhaps using the help of a 
counselor or the family doctor 
according to richard oberfield a clinical associate professor of 
child psychiatry at new york university medical center there are 
some common signs of first day jitters 
unusual clinging behavior 
toilet problems 
stomach aches 
insomnia 
new fears 
any behavior that seems regressive for your child such as 
whining or crying 
he suggests that parents go over in detail ahead of time exactly 
what will happen in school and assure the child that you or a family 
member will be there at the end of the school day 
oberfield says parents should consider their own fears as well 
children pick up on unspoken tensions and frustrations he says and 
it is not uncommon for parents to have mixed feelings about sending 
their child off to school 
coming to grips with your own fears should give your child the 
necessary positive reinforcement he says

the images of a college education usually include ivycovered 
walls treelined campuses and football saturday afternoons but 
some see more educational values in the realworld surroundings 
of a big city college 
a city provides cultural and intellectual resources such as 
museums theaters great libraries and galleries while also 
maintaining itself as a center of professional and economic 
growth says jim harrison president of the association of urban 
universities 
broadcast centers newspapers corporations hospitals banks 
and stock exchanges are all literally in a citys back yard 
harrison says cities also can offer a large pool of executives 
for parttime teaching 
the city has always been the natural place to study says 
harrison who points out that the university began in athens 1400 
years ago and revived in paris 800 years later 
eighty percent of the american population currently lives in a 
city and the urban campus is where the future workforce of our 
country is and will be trained says nevin brown assistant 
director of urban affairs national association of state 
universities and land grant colleges 
the advantages of getting an education in an urban environment 
are threefold a city has the great economic and cultural centers 
it will provide the best job opportunities in the future and it 
has the best representation of the population as a whole says 
brown 
michael gold recently transferred to the urban columbia college 
in chicago from william and mary college in virginia i have a 
better shot at connecting with a great internship and with the right 
job after graduation says the 24yearold marketing major 
because of our facultys expertise and involvement in the 
industry 
he says the concept of college is changing the world is 
speeding up and i believe theres a need to forgo some of the 
traditional college frills to compete in the marketplace and achieve 
career success says gold

childrens television viewing habits can be an early indicator of 
hearing and vision problems say doctors at new york 
hospitalcornell medical center 
one of the first signs of vision problems is if your child 
squints while looking at television says dr calvin roberts 
assistant professor of ophthamology at the hospital 
since children will not necessarily be aware of their own 
problems at the first sign of squinting parents should bring them 
to a physician for a checkup he says 
another sign of visual problems he says is when children 
complain they cant read the print on the tv set a possible 
indication of nearsightedness 
if children have astigmatism the signs will be different 
says roberts they will typically mistake 3s for 8s and 8s for 3s 
sometimes they will also confuse 4s and 5s 
television viewing habits may also indicate hearing problems 
children may increase the tv volume show inattentiveness while 
watching their favorite shows and say what more often when 
comments are made to them according to dr w shain schley these 
signs do not automatically mean a child has a hearing loss but they 
do indicate the need for a physical examination he says 
schley is associate professor of clinical otorhinolaryngology and 
director of the eye nose and throat service at new york

the lessons children learn in the school cafeteria will last them 
a lifetime says a hospital nutritionist and dietitian who lurges 
parents to instill good eating pattersn in their children 
the main culprit is fat says carol sherman director of food

if we could only teach our children to stay away from highfat 
foods or to consume them in moderation we would be making major

a trend toward more student participation in community service is 
apparent on the nations campuses according to several recent 
surveys leading some to refer to this college population as the 
we generation 
on the national level a study of incoming freshmen attitudes 
found that levels of participation in political activism and 
community service for freshmen in 1989 were greater than those of 
the last 1960s the survey was sponsored by ucla and the american 
council of education 
campus compact a coalition of colleges and universities 
committed to providing service opportunities for their students has 
grown from 12 institutions to 230 in the five years since it was 
founded in 1985 
in recent reports from our members says laina warsavage 
project coordinator at campus compact weve seen participation up 
15 to 20 percent in established programs all the way up to 300 
percent for newer ones 
at concordia college a survey showed young people are more 
likely to feel they have a future in their community when they are 
involved in service activities and feel they are valued by the 
community says paul dovre president of the moorhead minn 
school the survey of 2000 ninth and 12thgraders was conducted by 
the central minnesota leadership program 
at the university of rochester roughly one of every six 
undergraduates is involved in some kind of public service activity 
says james case director of career services and placement at the 
upstate new york school 
case says much of their community service goes unheralded because 
it is done quietly and through established programs instead of 
carrying placards and staging marches 
its time we gave credit to todays undergraduates for taking 
student activism from the picket lines into the homeless shelters 
from just marching against apartheid to raising money for 
scholarship funds for south african students says marsha duncan 
vice president for student affairs at lehigh university in 
pennsylvania 
she says about onefourth of the undergraduates at lehigh 
volunteer time at charitable organizations or raise money for the 
march of dimes easter seals or the red cross 
todays students are certainly challenging the status quo 
says the rev dr gary miller chaplain at lafayette college 
easton pa but instead of storming the symbols of power and 
indifference they are attempting to build a more just and caring 
future brick by brick meal by meal child by child 
and they are doing it with their most precious resource their 
time

teaching children about the 10foot danger zone surrounding 
school buses can be more important than teaching them about reading 
writing and arithmetic it can in fact be a matter of life and 
death 
with more than half the nations schoolage children being 
transported to their classrooms by bus traffic experts say they 
should be taught safety procedures by parents 
the most important place to learn about safety is in the 
home says gary anderson national driversafety manager of 
miamibased ryder student transportation services 
noting that the vast majority of serious accidents involving 
children and school buses occur in the 10footwide area surrounding 
the bus anderson suggests parents instruct their children to remain 
at least 10 feet from an approaching bus until it has stopped 
completely and then board in a single file line 
when leaving the bus he says they should walk at least 10 feet 
away and wait until it has left the bus stop 
because young children can see a bus they assume the driver 
can see them anderson explains so they often try to retrieve 
objects theyve dropped near the bus and thats a dangerous 
situation 
parents should teach their children that drivers may not be 
able to see them and that the sweaters and lunch boxes theyre 
running after arent as important as their safety 
ryder which transports more than 400000 students each school 
day in 15 states conducts safety and training programs for student 
passengers including one that utilizes a miniature robotic school 
bus 
parents are advised their children should be at the bus stop 
several minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive wait for the 
bus in a safe place away from where the bus stops and avoid 
horseplay 
other suggestions include 
never chase a bus after it has pulled away from the bus stop 
because even with multiple large mirrors a driver may not see a 
small child who is very near the body of the bus 
when entering the bus go directly to an available or assigned 
seat remain seated and facing forward at all times while the bus is 
moving 
do not extend hands elbows or head through the windows or 
throw or pass objects to someone outside the bus

curriculum says quaintance 
rocking horse based in cherry hill nj has programs designed 
for infants toddlers preschoolers prekindergarten and school

technology junkies will have to dig deep to buy 
the latest in selftuning televisions and digital audio tape 
players but the fancy features eventually will reach middleclass 
buyers industry players say 
the worlds largest consumer electronics show offers a look at 
the latest innovations including fuzzy logic a primitive kind 
of artificial intelligence that can automatically finetune a 
television sets color brightness contrast and sharpness it may 
be out of reach for most consumers now but prices could come down 
fast marketers say 
you can bet that fuzzy logic will become the buzzword of the 
consumer eletronics industry in the 1990s says brian klosterman 
marketing director of sony corp of america 
already there are products being introduced that contain the 
circuitry he said at this weekends opening of the 1990 
international summer consumer electronics show the show runs 
through tuesday and is closed to the public 
among the tens of thousands of audio video homeoffice and 
homeautomation products on display for retailers and their 
representatives are sonys two largescreen color tvs with fuzzy 
logic 
sonys 27inch xbr50 retail 1449 and the 32inch xbr50 
retail 2699 contain circuitry that automatically adjusts the 
picture on the screen 60 times every second 
more fuzzy logic devices will proliferate across our line 
klosterman said 
such highend televisions now represent only 13 percent of 
all color sets purchased but the features they contain are always 
incorporated into the ultimate products first and gradually come 
down into coreline production klosterman said 
sony and technics said over the weekend that they would bring 
longawaited digital audio tape players to the us market this 
year the products which already are sold in japan will cost 
around 1000 at first but not for long a technics spokesman 
predicted 
i foresee dat eventually replacing all of the standard cassette 
business said mike aguilar a spokesman for technics a secaucus 
njbased division of matsushita electric corp of america i 
anticipate it following the same exact course as compact disc 
players 
in 1983 they cost 1000 plus as the market grew and 
production expanded prices came down rapidly 
added aguilar it is going to be the future of home taping 
don krueger of sanyo securities of america the us arm of a 
major japanese brokerage said he foresees video laser disc players 
as the next hot item on the consumer electronics front 
everybody will have one of those in their homes a few years 
from now just as they have a vcr in their homes now he predicted 
video laser discs allow higher resolution than video tape and are 
virtually impossible to wear out the devices that play the discs 
already have reached a fairly standardized stable technology 
krueger said 
youll probably see the product coming down in price now 
theyre 600 to 700 ill bet youll see them at around 400 to 
500 by the end of the year

the toshiba machine co admits it doesnt know what 
happened to a shipment of hightech equipment that is reported to 
have gone to china in 1985 in violation of bans on sales of such 
machinery to communist countries 
three years later toshiba machine was penalized by the united 
states and japan for exporting sensitive machinery to the soviet 
union despite an agreement by western countries prohibiting such 
shipments to communist nations 
japan got a black eye for its trading practices from which it 
has still not recovered though regulations have been tightened 
the revelation of the china deal appears likely to raise the 
question of whether other hightech transactions slipped through in 
the years of less stringent supervision 
tracing such deals a halfdecade later can lead to dead ends as 
an associated press investigation showed in following up a report in 
a japanese magazine that machinery used in manufacturing computer 
memory chips had gone to china via hong kong 
the hong kong buyers have vanished now and there is no factory 
at least now in the building where the equipment was sent 
toshiba machines earlier problem came from exporting via 
norway sophisticated milling equipment in 1984 it allegedly 
permitted the soviet union to make submarines quieter and more 
difficult to detect and washington was furious when the story 
emerged in 1987 
in 1988 washington barred the parent company the electronics 
giant toshiba corp which holds 50 percent of toshiba machine from 
bidding on us government contracts for one year and toshiba 
machine was banned from exporting anything to the united states for 
three years japan blocked toshiba machine indefinitely from exports 
to communist countries 
the possible diversion of equipment to china is coming to light 
two years after the expiration of japans statute of limitations for 
violations of export law 
on may 19 the new monthly generalinterest magazine foresight 
published by shinchosha a major book and magazine publisher 
reported that toshiba machines electron beam lithography system 
went to china via hong kong in 1985 the system is able to 
manufacture vital parts for the mass production of memory chips and 
at the time it was prohibited for sale to china under japans export 
regulations 
the ap obtained copies of documents showing the price paid 
acceptance by the hong kong company and a receipt by the shanghai 
metal research institute dated sept 11 1985 for the eb105 rb40 
system 
toshiba machine officials confirmed the authenticity of the 
documents with the exception of the purported receipt by the 
shanghai metal research institute which was issued to the name of a 
chinese individual as seller 
all we can say is we sold the device to a hong kong company 
under proper procedures but we have no way of knowing what happened 
to it afterwards kinji matsumoto a director of toshiba machine 
told the ap 
matsumoto and other company officials said two men had tried to 
blackmail the company over the transaction last year the company 
refused to pay and reported the entire incident to the ministry of 
international trade and industry in may 1989 matsumoto said 
in march this year the ministrys export division requested a 
full explanation he said 
the ministry appeared satisfied with our explanation though 
its officials were not happy to hear about such an incident he 
said we were told we have to be more careful 
a ministry of international trade and industry official 
acknowledged today that toshiba machine had sold the machinery to 
the hong kong company without completing a full check of the 
enduser 
the official also conceded that his ministry should have examined 
the deal more closely 
but at that point the export control was not as strictly 
enforced as it is today and we cant really blame toshiba machine 
or export control staff of the ministry said the official 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
exporting certain hightech equipment to communist countries 
violates japanese export control law and the cocom an international 
agreement of the coordinating committee for multilateral export 
control aimed at keeping certain sophisticated technology out of 
communist hands 
the regulations also require strict identification of the 
enduser of such equipment in countries to which export is 
permitted but in the sale to hong kong the middlemen and buyer of 
record have all apparently disappeared 
toshiba machine officials say they sold the equipment to a hong 
kong company called scientific instruments ltd but such a company 
does not exist at the address stated in the contract the ap 
telephoned a company by the same name located at a different 
address in hong kong but officials there said their company 
specializes in handling medical equipment and never had such a 
machine 
a hong kong trading company that financed and mediated the 
transaction tradecity investment also was not located at the 
address stated in the contract 
toshiba machine officials said their staff in hong kong made 
inquiries but could not find the factory where scientific 
instruments said the sensitive equipment was to be installed 
the officials explained that scientific instruments had not 
prepared a suitable factory and did not permit toshiba engineers to 
install the equipment so toshiba machine refused to guarantee 
performance of the machinery worth 451 million yen then equivalent 
to 2 million 
last time we saw the machine was when unopened wooden boxes 
were placed in a factory in hong kong in may 1985 said takanori 
yamada director of the corporate planning department of toshiba 
machine we never saw the machine after then there was no 
further contact with scientific instruments he said 
toshiba machine officials said they believed the machine wouldnt 
be resold elsewhere because hong kong authorities gave the import 
permission on condition that it be used only in hong kong 
we are quite confident that we did every possible check back 
then matsumoto said if you tell us today that our machine is 
not in hong kong all i can say is it is way beyond our control 
he stressed that the company had tightened its export control 
system in 1987 and the hong kong deal could not have happened 
under the present system but the atmosphere back then was somewhat 
looser than today 
japanese law also was tightened after the 1987 scandal and while 
some cocom violations have been reported the severe penalties on 
toshiba machine and toshiba are widely thought to have had a 
deterring effect 
ap attempts to trace the machinery quickly reached a dead end 
luo tengjiao an official at the shanghai metal research institute 
whose name appeared on the purported receipt as one of several 
people accepting delivery of the machine denied in a telephone 
interview the purchase of such equipment 
but a shanghai daily wen hui bao reported the institute 
succeeded in manufacturing 16bit cpus computer central processing 
units on aug 14 1986 15 months after the machinery was shipped 
to hong kong

donald trumps main bank creditors are likely to 
force the developer to sell part of his vast empire to help cover 
his roughly 2 billion in bank debts a newspaper reported today 
trump hasnt missed any interest or principal payments but 
bankers are concerned many of his properties including the 
justopened taj mahal casino in atlantic city nj and the trump 
shuttle airline arent producing enough revenue to ensure future 
payments the wall street journal said in todays edition 
trump recently announced 450 employee layoffs at the taj and 
another 50 to 100 at the shuttle 
but at least one banking source told the journal that wasnt 
enough he will have to trim the fat get rid of the boat the 
mansions the helicopter the banker said 
unidentified bankers involved in negotiations with the trump 
organization told the journal the creditors might also pressure 
management changes and a more conservative operating style 
a spokeswoman for the trump organization did not immediately 
return a telephone call seeking comment today 
trump who owes another 1 billion to bondholders is due to make 
about 30 million in payments on the bonds in midjune the bankers 
however want to be assured they also will be paid before the 
payment is made the journal said 
one solution to trumps reported problems would be for the banks 
to lend him more money and allow him to resolve his cash flow 
problems on his own 
however the banks reportedly have the upper hand in the 
negotiations and could take the other extreme of calling in trumps 
loans a move that could force trump into federal bankruptcy court 
negotiations between trump executives and the banks have taken 
place daily in trump tower overlooking central park the journal 
said 
trumps selfpromotion and tendency to emblazon his name on 
everything he bought had helped him convince banks that a propertys 
resale value would be secure because he made properties trophies as 
he has been fond of calling them seem special 
the properties cashflow potential was irrelevant trump argued 
because he would be able to sell them at a profit 
in april trump said he was considering selling the shuttle but 
insisted that his intention was to become king of cash so he 
could buy more properties if the real estate market worsened trump 
strongly denied he was having any cash flow troubles

the number of working us oil and natural gas 
rigs fell by 18 to total 983 snapping four consecutive weeks of 
gains that had pushed the weekly tally over the 1000 mark baker 
hughes inc reported monday 
a year ago the houstonbased companys count stood at 784

that the widely watched industry index of drilling activity topped 
1000 it also marked the first time since 1985 that the 1000 mark

in december 1981 at the height of the oil boom the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but oil prices plunged to less than 10 per 
42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 prompting a collapse in the 
rig count that bottomed out at 663 the lowest since hughes began 
compiling figures

statistics of consumer goods on which the official statistics are 
based

and included a 4 percent increase in farm output and a 79 percent 
rise in industrial goods the gdp growth in fiscal 1989 was 48

grain and soybean futures fell in early trading 
today on the chicago board of trade 
weather continues to be the driving force behind the market as 
the rains forecast for the past weekend were less than expected 
said richard feltes an analyst with refco inc in chicago 
the national weather services six to 10day forecast calls for 
warmer drier weather in the midwest this week that should allow 
farmers to wrap up their planting 
the forecast is expected to pressure corn and soybean futures 
improved harvest conditions for the winter wheat crop is putting 
pressure on wheat futures 
however analysts say the signing late friday of a longterm 
grain agreement between the united states and the soviet union could 
provide support to grain futures

contract for delivery in july at 326 a bushel corn was 2 cents 
to 3 cents lower with july at 272 a bushel oats were 2 cents to

regional fortunes seem to be constantly shifting 
said janet norwood labor statistics commissioner in her monthly 
employment report to congress 
the striking stability of the national jobless rate over the past 
two years she told the joint economic committee has disguised 
substantial and important regional shifts 
during the past 12 months for example the nations official 
monthly jobless rate has varied from 53 percent only three times 
in may 1989 and in march 1990 when it read 52 percent and in april 
1990 when 54 percent was recorded 
remarkable stability indeed but only when you average things 
out and averages are not what people live by 
the jobless rate in new england for example had been unusually 
low a year or so ago in some communities as low as 3 percent which 
statisticians believe is about as low as you can get 
but in the past year unemployment in that sixstate new england 
region has risen 2 percentage points bringing the situation there 
close to the national average 
the southern region also has been closing in on the national 
average but from a different direction rates there which had been 
among the highest in the nation have been improving ie going the 
opposite way 
it is out of such differences that national averages come into 
being they are official they are highly publicized and analyzed 
they produce profound documents on possible policy implications 
but to residents of those two huge areas of america especially 
jobseekers and jobholders those official statistics mislead 
generally speaking said norwood the last year has seen some 
convergence of state and regional unemployment rates with the 
worseoff areas improving and the best deteriorating 
this is a big country statisticians explain and some of them 
say it is about time the differences were recognized us regional 
economies they say are as big as the economies of major 
industrialized nations 
geographical differences arent the only ones sector differences 
are just as pronounced 
job growth in manufacturing has been weak but until the past few 
months it had been strong in services healthcare costs and 
employment have been beating an independent path upward for years 
it is in the geographical area however where the vastness of 
the separate american economies is most pronounced 
while homebuilding is off in new england where it had been 
booming it is up in houston where it had collapsed while 
economies of some rocky mountain and southeast states are depressed 
several midwest states are well off 
one wellknown market research firm sindlinger amp co claims 
that it is only a specific interpretation of statistical evidence 
that keeps the commerce department from recognizing that a national 
recession might already exist 
its not the first time such a situation has existed says albert 
sindlinger whose research suggests there are far more states in 
recession than are free of it but that the national averages 
disguise their plight 
vivid contrasts always can be found among geographical and 
sectoral areas and that poses an enormous challenge to those who 
handle the economic levers such as federal reserve officials 
the fed mechanism it has been demonstrated in the past few 
years can be very sensitive to national statistics it has used 
them for example to skirt the fine line between economic growth 
and shrinkage 
but it is not nearly as adept at handling regional or sectoral 
statistics one of its most effective tools for instance is the 
fine tuning of interest rates nationally but interest rates and the 
availability of funds still vary greatly from area to area 
national economics not microeconomics is its specialty and 
with regional economies growing and going their independent ways 
microeconomics might be the big challenge to be met

ford motor co has told its dealers that it 
expects them to perform warranty service on all ford lincoln or 
mercury cars even if the car was purchased elsewhere a company 
spokeswoman said monday 
the new policy will take effect on september 1 said anne 
doylefarrell spokeswoman for fords warranty division 
most dealers already follow this policy but fords directive 
will ensure they all do doylefarrell said its become more of an 
issue in recent years as consumers began to shop more for prices 
among different dealers she said 
but new york state attorney general robert abrams who announced 
the change said a ford dealers decision to provide warranty 
service on cars purchased elsewhere is the exception rather than the 
rule 
abrams said ford agreed to change its policy following 
negotiations with his office 
car buyers will be able to shop around for the best purchase 
price while still being able to use their auto warranty at a 
convenient location abrams said 
but doylefarrell said abrams was one of several different people 
to bring the policy to fords attention and he wasnt the key to the 
change 
we were already interested in changing because of customer 
satisfaction she said

chevron corp appears to be on a fast track 
toward developing the huge tengiz oil field in a joint venture with 
the soviet government but it faces a long road before the deal is 
complete analysts said monday 
chevron has agreed with the soviet ministry of oil and gas 
industry to study the feasibility of developing the field with 
reserves estimated at more than 25 billion barrels about 2 times 
those of alaskas prudhoe bay 
the protocol of intentions agreement signed saturday is the 
first step toward an eventual joint venture to extract the oil 
but long negotiations are expected before any joint venture 
agreement is reached complicating the dealmaking are the tangled 
soviet bureaucracy and a history of questionable success even in 
cases where joint venture agreements formally are reached only 15 
percent actually go into operation 
nevertheless the soviets appear highly motivated to ensure that 
the tengiz development and similar projects actually occur the 
soviet union is the worlds biggest oil producer but production has 
fallen in recent years and us technology and capital are needed 
to reverse that trend said warren m shimmerlik a senior oil 
analyst for county natwest usa in new york 
its clear that this is a huge resource shimmerlik said 
and this is the kind of asset that if opened up to the west could 
be very significant 
however he said success is years away furthermore while 
chevron may expect to make a profit its unlikely to get a windfall 
they will negotiate a reasonable deal shimmerlik said the 
soviets want this work done and both sides will benefit from it 
eugene nowak who heads the energy group at dean witter reynolds 
inc warned that the protocol is just a first step in what could 
become a significant project for chevron he said there appeared to 
be no way chevron could lose the worst that could happen is 
nothing nowak said 
based on what company officials are saying about the timetable 
chevron appears to be on a rather fast track nowak said 
the uncertainty is that this is a new venture for the soviets 
and its the business side thats questionable rather than the 
technical side nowak said 
shimmerlik said he expects the soviets ultimately to allow 
several more companies into similar projects 
there will be plenty of companies doing this and its a 
question of who winds up with the best properties he said

the supreme court on monday left intact an 
alabama tax attacked as grossly discriminatory against 
outofstate businesses 
arguments that the tax interferes unduly with interstate commerce 
and violates equal protection rights were rejected by the court 
without comment 
in other action the court 
agreed to study the governments power to lift price controls on 
some natural gas a case that has tens of millions of dollars at 
stake for consumers the federal regulations were struck down by a 
federal appeals court but will remain in effect until a supreme 
court decision is announced likely in 1991 
strengthened the governments power to keep the taxes withheld 
from businesses about to declare bankruptcy voting 90 the 
justices ruled that the trustee of bankrupt american international 
airways is not entitled to recover 700000 in taxes paid to the 
internal revenue service 
ordered a lower court to reconsider a ruling that exempted the 
nuclear regulatory commission from collective bargaining with its 
employees over salaries the justices said the lower court should 
restudy the case in light of a high court ruling may 29 that the 
army must bargain with unions over wages and fringe benefits paid to 
civilian teachers at armyrun schools for the children of military 
and civilian personnel 
ruled that nuclear industry whistleblowers who say they were 
disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their employers 
under state personal injury laws the court unanimously said such 
lawsuits are not preempted by a federal law protecting 
whistleblowers 
agreed to decide whether passengers on international flights may 
sue airlines for emotional distress allegedly suffered in 
nearcrashes that cause them no physical harm the court said it 
will review a ruling that eastern airlines may be forced to pay 
passengers on a flight that landed safely in miami after all the 
planes engines failed briefly in the air 
in the alabama tax case the state supreme court had concluded 
that the tax was valid while acknowledging that it was more onerous 
for outofstate businesses 
there is no unconstitutional unequal treatment of foreign 
corporations and no unconstitutional discrimination against them 
the state court ruled last dec 21 
the tax was challenged by detroitbased general motors corp and 
its subsidiaries and by reynolds metals co which is based in 
richmond va 
alabama imposes a franchise tax on all business conducted in the 
state companies based outside the state pay a tax of 3 for every 
1000 worth of capital in the state instate companies pay 10 for 
every 1000 worth of all outstanding stock 
lawyers for gm and reynolds metals told the justices that the two 
methods of calculating the tax result in enormously higher taxes for 
outofstate businesses 
the reason is that while the amount of business activity 
conducted and total capital employed in alabama means everything in 
determining the foreign corporations tax liability gms appeal 
said business activity and total capital employed mean nothing in 
determining the domestic corporations liability 
for 1982 and 1983 alabama collected 94 million in franchise 
taxes from outofstate businesses based on 28792 tax returns and 
less than 10 million from instate businesses based on 81698 
returns 
adjustments to the tax law took effect in 1984 but that year 
outofstate businesses paid 496 million in franchise taxes and 
instate businesses paid 147 million 
reynolds metals paid about 12 million in franchise taxes for 
1982 and 1983 the years for which it sued for refunds 
gm sued over the years 1983 through 1988 in which it paid 63 
million in alabama franchise taxes 
the two appeals were supported by the state tax council of the 
state chambers of commerce and an organization called the tax 
executives institute 
the broad implication of the state courts holding is that 
discrimination against outofstate taxpayers will be 
tolerated lawyers for the chamber of commerces council said 
if interstate business is to be protected from discriminatory 
state taxes the decision of the alabama supreme court must be 
reviewed

to finance their businesses women fish dealers 
in ghana had to pay 100 percent interest to moneylenders until 
womens world banking opened an office in accra and backed loans to 
them from a local bank 
the new yorkbased group since 1980 has been providing financial 
support and guidance in lessdeveloped nations for women who may 
have good business ideas but lack capital management skills and 
confidence 
the nonprofit organizations goals are equality for women in 
economic development as well as helping women achieve dignity from 
financial independence 
michaela walsh a former wall street investment banker who helped 
found wwb said banks in many countries traditionally have had 
little interest in small loans bankers may object to having to 
perform too much paperwork for too little profit or believe that a 
lack of confidence by a loan applicant indicates theyre a bad risk 
besides guaranteeing loans wwb trains women to run their 
businesses and publishes a trade atlas with profiles of 38 
countries explanations of transactions and a glossary of trade 
terms 
since it backed its first small loan for a bicycle repair shop in 
cali colombia in 1981 wwb has handled 12 million in loans some 
45000 loans averaging from 500 to 1500 through 46 affiliates 
in 35 countries in asia the americas europe and africa 
each affiliate is run by people from the country it serves in 
the ghanian capital of accra for example the affiliate was founded 
by an appeals court judge an economist and several manufacturers 
part of the work is convincing local banks to make the small 
loans to women who are poor and often illiterate wwb guarantees 
half the loan the local affiliate guarantees 25 percent and the 
local bank assumes 25 percent the borrower pays interest at the 
going market rate 
wwbs repayment rate has been 99 percent better than for most 
banks that lend in developing countries ms walsh said 
in some cases the affiliates act as advocates for women within 
their own families officers will talk to a man who controls the 
familys capital said christine hayanga a nairobi lawyer and 
regional officer for wwb in africa during a recent visit in new 
york 
we tell them we dont want you to die of a heart attack 
share some of your responsibility with your wife 
if the woman has no male relative with money to fund her business 
proposal wwb will guide her through the borrowing process 
one of the major things that attracted me to this was 
discovering in 1975 that women in most countries didnt even have 
credit ms walsh said she said banks generally did not want to 
deal with women because they lacked credit history collateral or 
legal standing 
ms walsh said she learned about the credit problem in 1975 at 
the united nations international womens conference in mexico city 
she also found that women worldwide accounted for 10 percent of 
income but owned less than 1 percent of assets the answer to 
changing the imbalance she thought was entrepreneurship 
at the same time she was inspired by the work of ela bhatt in 
india a member of indias planning commission who helped start a 
cooperative bank for poor women in india in 1974 
the wwb capital fund was built up by investors and support from 
the governments of canada sweden norway the netherlands and the 
united states as well as some corporations and foundations and the 
united nations 
wwb expects to branch out soon with larger loans through a new 
venture fund with limited partners making direct investments of up 
to 1 million 
wwb also is growing through new affiliates that include akron and 
yellow springs ohio philadelphia and charleston wva

states sometimes may be forced to pay refunds 
on money collected under taxes later ruled unlawful the supreme 
court said monday 
the court unanimously ruled in a florida case that states are not 
immune from being sued for refunds on unlawfully paid taxes and 
that the states can be ordered to provide some remedy 
but by a 54 vote in a case from arkansas the justices said 
businesses are not entitled to refunds on money paid under such 
unlawful taxes if state officials had no way of knowing the taxes 
interfered unconstitutionally with interstate commerce 
and the court said in the florida case that refunds are just one 
option in a panoply of remedies states may provide if successfully 
sued over taxes 
the court also stopped short of allowing full retroactivity for 
court decisions striking down state taxes instead it said refunds 
are possible if taxed activity occurred after the tax was 
invalidated or after state officials should have suspected the tax 
was flawed 
the justices were told that a highwayuse tax at issue in the 
arkansas case also is a controversy in pennsylvania kentucky new 
jersey and vermont with potential refunds of at least 630 million 
at stake 
but for other controversies the effect of mondays decisions is 
unclear 
for example the justices last year struck down a michigan law 
that taxed the pension benefits of retired federal employees but not 
the pensions of retired people who had worked for the state or its 
local governments 
the court said states must tax all government pensions or none 
but its decision left unanswered whether states must refund to 
pensioners the taxes already collected 
lawsuits seeking refunds have been filled in about half the 
states and the potential refund liability is about 2 billion 
the arkansas case decided monday was one of several in which the 
american trucking associations challenged the validity of a state 
highwayuse tax the associations sued arkansas in 1983 attacking 
the states highway use equalization tax 
a flat tax it resulted in a higher cost per mile for 
outofstate truckers than for instate truckers 
the arkansas supreme court upheld the tax but in 1987 the 
nations highest court struck down as unconstitutional two very 
similar taxes imposed on truckers by pennsylvania the arkansas 
legislature then repealed its state highwayuse tax 
the state supreme court however ruled that the trucking 
associations members were entitled to refunds only of the 49 
million in taxes paid into a special escrow account created in 1987 
about 160 million in flatuse taxes had been collected by 
arkansas before the escrow account was established in the wake of 
the supreme court decision on the pennsylvania taxes 
led by justice sandra day oconnor the court monday made clear 
that its 1987 ruling in the pennsylvania case was intended to 
apply only prospectively 
flat highway taxation was permissible for highway use that 
occurred before the date of our decision but not after oconnor 
wrote in the courts main opinion 
she was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and justices 
byron r white and anthony m kennedy justice antonin scalia joined 
in the result but for differing reasons 
justices john paul stevens william j brennan thurgood marshall 
and harry a blackmun dissented voting to impose greater 
retroactive liability on the states 
the court sent the case back to the arkansas supreme court for 
further study 
we are not in a position to determine precisely the nature and 
extent of the relief to which the truckers are entitled for their 
19871988 hue tax payments oconnor said that determination 
lies with the state courts in the first instance 
in the florida case the states tax structure at one time 
granted preferential treatment to alcoholic beverages made and 
bottled in florida from crops grown there 
the state legislature responding to a 1984 supreme court 
decision that struck down a similar tax setup in hawaii amended the 
law so that it granted preferences only for alcoholic beverages made 
from among other things citrus fruits 
the florida supreme court struck down the amended tax preference 
as unconstitutionally discriminatory against outofstate 
businesses but the state court ruled that distributors who had paid 
higher taxes were not entitled to any refunds 
the justices monday reversed the state supreme court ruling and 
sent the case back for a determination of what relief is required 
the state is free to choose which form of relief it will 
provide so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal 
requirements he added 
the cases are mckesson corp vs division of alcoholic beverages 
and tobacco 88192 and american trucking association vs smith 
88325

national bank of canada said monday it has 
extended the deadline by which robert campeau must pay 40 million 
canadian dollars to regain the campeau corp stock that the bank 
seized from him last january 
the bank announced that campeau received the reprieve after 
missing a thursday midnight deadline 
bank spokesman carole gagne would not say how long the extension 
was for but published reports put it at 30 days in mondays 
trading the us dollar was trading at about 1175 canadian 
dollars making the value of the payment campeau faces worth about 
34 million us 
the bank had seized the securities after campeau missed payments 
on about 150 million canadian dollars in loans earlier this year 
but campeau who has lost much of his personal fortune with the 
plunge in the companys stock in the past year surprised financial 
circles with a deal to buy the shares back transfer of the 
securities would return control of the torontobased company to 
campeau 
under the deal campeau who is still chairman of the company he 
founded agreed to pay 80 million canadian dollars in two equal 
installments the first payment was due last thursday in exchange 
for the securities 
the deal which had been disclosed in filings with the us 
securities and exchange commission said the second payment was due 
at the end of 1991 
under the original agreement if campeau fails to make the 
payments the bank can seize the securities again the agreement also 
included a provision whereby the two sides could mutually postpone 
the deadline which they have now decided to do 
campeau owns two extensive us retailing companies operating 
under bankruptcy court protection the restructuring of the canadian 
parent has no direct bearing on the bankruptcy reorganization of 
cincinnatibased allied stores corp and federated department stores

students wont roam the campus of the 
gorbachev maxwell institute of technology and its initial proposed 
endowment of 100 million is paltry compared with those of other 
worldclass research facilities 
but supporters say the institute would bring together the worlds 
top scientists to solve problems that matter to humanity 
everybody in the world would love to have an institute of this 
kind robert h smith chairman of the institutes board said 
monday 
plans for the institute which is to focus on research into 
communications and the environment were announced sunday during 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs visit to the twin cities 
british publishing magnate robert maxwell has pledged 50 million if 
state officials raise a matching amount 
smith conceded that the institutes mission is vague but said 
its premature to set specific goals until funds are raised and 
scientists are recruited 
you cant do the last part first said smith who is also 
vice chairman of maxwell communications north america the nations 
secondlargest printer 
minnesota gov rudy perpich who at times has been criticized for 
dabbling in foreign affairs is credited with lobbying maxwell to 
fund the institute gorbachevs visit to minnesota at perpichs 
invitation provided the momentum for the project and the soviet 
president gave his blessing to the institute that will bear his name 
spokesman robert finn of california institute of technology said 
the project might be difficult to get off the ground but predicted 
it would have a fair chance of success 
gorby tech is going to have certain advantages finn said 
scientists would be free of teaching responsibilities and thats 
attractive to many people there may be freedom from one of the 
things that scientists hate most grant applications 
finn said the twin cities institute would likely have more 
success if it focused on specific goals such as the environment and 
communications 
environmental research is not one of the most heavily funded 
areas of science these days he said scientists in those 
specific fields might be interested 
smith said hes confident the funds can be raised and the 
institute opened he predicted the initial 100 million would be 
raised by the end of 1991 but said there is no firm date projected 
for the facility to open 
maxwell wouldnt have pledged 50 million for the project if he 
didnt believe it could succeed smith said 
he is a guy who believes that communications and the ability to 
transcend ethnic and nationalistic boundaries is an extremely 
important idea for getting along in the world to come smith said

president bush is expected to postpone new oil 
drilling off the california and florida coasts for up to 12 years 
in some areas so additional environmentalimpact studies can be 
done administration officials said monday 
the officials said the president appeared ready to endorse a 
course that would ban new exploration off florida until 2002 off 
northern california until 1997 and off southern california until at 
least 1992 
although the sources speaking on the condition of anonymity 
cautioned that bush still could change course and allow some 
leasing one official closely involved with the decision said i 
would be surprised if he did not go forward with the overall delay 
an electionyear decision to delay the leasing would play well 
among republicans in california and florida many have urged the 
delay voicing concerns about a negative reaction from voters if 
bush opened any areas to new drilling before the november balloting 
environmentalists have argued that the threat to the environment 
off both states has been shown and that new drilling should be 
banned altogether 
we will be very disappointed if all were offered by bush is 
a delay said lisa speer an attorney for the natural resources 
defense council the public has moved far beyond where delays are 
going to satisfy people its time to move to protect some of these 
areas permanently 
the longpending presidential decision was anticipated in the 
next few days 
while bush still had a range of options before him the consensus 
among officials who have worked on the decision is that bush will 
approve a delay in leasing for all three areas according to the 
administration sources 
postponing new drilling would conform to conclusions of a task 
force bush appointed last year to study the problem 
oil activity would be banned in all the areas until at least 
1992 when the interior department is to produce its next fiveyear 
plan for oil leasing around the country if bush keeps to the 
decision his aides expect the fiveyear plan includes a broad 
outline of what areas will be considered for leasing and how the 
department will deal with leases for those five years 
the president still had before him a variety of options ranging 
from opening the coasts to new offshore oil activity to imposing a 
moratorium 
the options that the president has expressed most interest in 
involve postponing any new drilling with the possibility of 
differing delay times the officials said 
they cautioned however that bush a former texas oil executive 
could switch courses at the last minute and back an option that 
would permit some new leasing activity 
bush named a task force last year headed by interior secretary 
manuel lujan to work with the national academy of sciences in 
studying the environmental impact of opening the three areas to oil 
leasing off northern southern california and the florida keys 
the task force in its report to bush in january cited a need 
for further study on the environmental and socioeconomic 
ramifications of new lease sales sources have said 
the broadest set of options initially placed before the president 
by his staff ranged from allowing immediate drilling in the study 
areas to permanently barring oil companies from the regions 
environmentalists have long opposed oil drilling in the three 
regions a 67million acre section of ocean off southern 
california 12 million acres 
off northern california and 13 million acres in the gulf of 
mexico near the florida everglades 
the environmentalists concerns about damage to beaches and 
endangering of wildlife from leaks intensified after the exxon 
valdez tanker spill off alaska a year ago 
the florida congressional delegation unanimously asked bush to 
bar new drilling off their state republican gov bob martinez who 
faces uncertain reelection prospects this year is a strong 
moratorium proponent 
in california the political positions are a bit more mixed but 
even conservative republicans now call for protection of 
environmentally sensitive areas from oil drilling 
republican sen pete wilson rcalif who faces only token 
opposition in the gop primary tuesday but a bruising campaign for 
governor of california is a strong moratorium backer who bucked the 
reagan administrations efforts to open new leasing areas off the 
states coast 
the policy initiated by thenpresident reagans interior 
secretary james watt opened to drilling the entire 14 
billionacre outer continental shelf but leasing has been blocked 
over the years by congressionally imposed moratoriums 
in florida the government sold 73 leases in the affected area in 
the early 1980s for 108 million the cost of buying the leases back 
could be closer to 200 million according to some interior 
department officials 
southern california is the only region of the country other than 
the gulf of mexico where offshore oil development is underway 22 
oil platforms are operating the current fiveyear lease program had 
anticipated additional lease sales last september but those sales 
were put off pending the presidents decision 
the northern california leases some 90 miles north of san 
francisco and off eureka had been scheduled for sale early last 
year but the sale was postponed

energy futures prices skidded lower monday as 
traders grew more pessimistic about the oversupply of crude on world 
markets 
the july contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude oil fell 36 cents to 1714 a 42gallon barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange with other contract months also 
dropping 
madison galbraith an analyst with merrill lynch energy futures 
summed up the markets problems theres too much crude 
energy futures prices slumped last week because of supply 
concerns and mondays decline was a continuation of that downturn

wholesale gasoline for delivery in july plunged 120 cents to 5958 
cents a gallon with subsequent months also falling 
and the july contract for home heating oil tumbled 114 cents to 
4759 cents a gallon later months also declined 
prices have been falling since the beginning of the year as the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries has been unable to 
stop some of its members from exceeding their production quotas 
at this point even if opec members do cut back their output 
bearish traders believe this will only slow and not reduce the 
oversupply of crude galbraith said 
natural gas prices were little changed monday the july contract 
closed at 1582 per 1000 cubic feet down from 1585 on friday

the head of nbc news conceded to affiliates 
monday we screwed up the today show with changes that led to 
jane pauleys leaving in december 
however michael gartner told the annual nbc affiliates 
convention that key changes have been made including a new 
executive producer for the show tom capra 
now with the dust settled hell make it well make it 
another winner he said the show has been second in ratings to 
abcs good morning america for 21 weeks 
the affection of affiliate executives for pauley succeeded on 
today by deborah norville was amply illustrated when they gave 
her a standing ovation as she appeared on stage at the national 
theater where gartner spoke 
i have never been happier in my work said pauley who is 
preparing a series of primetime specials for nbc and is substitute 
evening news anchor when tom brokaw is away 
gartner didnt specify the mistakes that caused the slump 
but seeking to make amends to executives of nbcs 208 affiliated 
stations gartner also tried to show progress on two other news 
fronts 
he said a new 24hour news service the nbc news channel will 
start serving affiliates in january providing international 
national and regional news for use in their own newscasts 
the service wont transmit stories on a nonstop basis as does 
cable news network nor will it have news anchors as some industry 
observers thought it would 
it is intended to help nbc stations compete with cnns newscasts 
and to ward off further encroachments by cnn on nbc stations 
cnn says it has 216 broadcast affiliates of which 52 are nbc 
affiliates 
gartner also introduced the new executive producer of the 
thirdinratings nbc nightly news steve friedman calling him a 
show doctor who will make nightly sparkle 
friedman is a former executive producer of today credited 
with making that show first in ratings before leaving it in 1987 to 
create what turned out to be a costly syndicated flop usa today 
on tv 
welcome to nbc news version of back to the future 
friedman joked alluding to his return and the rehiring of joe 
garagiola as a cohost on today with norville and bryant gumbel 
garagiola was a today cohost from 1969 to 1973 
garagiola who is not scheduled to start on today until june 
11 appeared on stage with gumbel norville weatherman willard 
scott and other new additions anchor faith daniels and 
correspondent katherine couric 
capra appearing separately said garagiola will be the glue 
that holds the show together 
in speaking of capras hiring last year gartner said we know 
we screwed up the today show he knows what the show needs and 
he knows how to provide it 
the usuallybrash friedman was cautious and didnt promise a fast 
ratings rise for nightly news 
however he said there would be changes to make the newscast more 
of a ratings contender he didnt outline the changes citing 
competitive reasons 
newscasts no longer just index the days events he told an 
audience of 1100 
we cant come on and say these are the top stories people 
have heard them already 
we are going to do a show of interest not the show of 
record he added we are going to be active not reactive 
the opening of nbcs threeday session began the same day as fox 
broadcastings convention in los angeles 
atlhough some nbc station executives chatted among themselves 
about next falls thursday night faceoff between nbcs powerhouse 
the cosby show and foxs cartoon hit the simpsons nbc 
president robert c wright warned them a battle was beginning on 
several fronts 
nbc first in prime time for five seasons is ready for next 
fall he said weve got victories in the future but theyll be 
smaller victories than the ones we enjoyed in the past 
cable has become strong fox is probably even stronger than we 
had anticipated and is rapidly moving toward a sevennight 
schedule and abc and cbs have been rejuvenated he said 
to stay a financially strong network we must gain an equal 
footing with our unregulated competitors he said cable was 
deregulated by congress in 1984 but is facing some possible 
reregulation

greyhound lines inc filed for chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection monday saying it was worried creditors would 
try to seize buses and terminals as the company struggled into the 
fourth month of a drivers strike 
officials said the filing would not affect service at the only 
nationwide bus company 
we have taken this action to enable greyhound lines to continue 
operation of its of its total system said j michael doyle 
senior vice president and chief financial officer 
the petition was filed with the us bankruptcy court for the 
southern district of texas in brownsville 
the filing under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code allows 
the company to continue operating under court supervision while it 
tries to reorganize its finances and pay off creditors 
union officials were not immediately available to comment on the 
bankruptcy filing 
greyhound has been struggling since bus drivers walked out march 
2 the company has been operating a reduced schedule but the sliced 
revenue and increased expenses of fighting the strike have siphoned 
off cash needed to operate 
the company lost 56 million in the first quarter it has missed 
more than 16 million in principal interest and lease payments 
since the end of april putting it in default on numerous agreements 
with creditors 
in the past few days there has been a lot of pressure by 
creditors who own buses and terminals that the company leases 
said president frank schmieder 
we tried to stay out of bankruptcy as long as possible 
schmieder said 
there will be no interruption of service doyle said adding 
that the company had asked the bankruptcy court to honor tickets 
already purchased 
for the passengers bankruptcy ought to be pretty 
transparent schmieder said the network is up in full and were 
going to need all the employees that we currently have 
two weeks ago the company proposed repurchasing 225 million of 
its junk bond debt at a steep discount provided it could find 
enough financing to pay about 90 million for the bonds and leave 
the company with about 35 million in operating capital 
we have asked creditors for patience so that we could devote 
all available resources to running maximum service during the peak 
summer travel season doyle said 
while most have been cooperative we were faced with the threat 
of a run on assets that could have crippled our ability to 
operate he said 
we are highly confident we will be successful in restructuring 
our debt doyle added 
schmieder said negotiations are continuing on financing the debt 
restructuring but it will take longer now because the courts will 
have to approve any financial restructuring 
the company did not estimate when it hoped to emerge from court 
supervision 
the filing covers greyhound and five affiliates including eagle 
bus manufacturing co which is based in brownsville the other 
affiliates are gli bus operations holding co buslease inc 
trailways commuter transit inc and gli food services inc 
greyhounds parent gli holding co wasnt included in the 
filing 
most of greyhounds 6300 drivers walked out over wages and job 
security the company has been operating a reduced schedule with 
nearly 3000 newly hired drivers 
after attempts to reopen negotiations collapsed early last month 
chairman fred g currey said may 7 the strike had become 
irrelevant because the carrier had enough drivers to operate 
just two weeks later however the company acknowledged severe

students wont roam the campus of the 
gorbachev maxwell institute of technology and its initial proposed 
endowment of 100 million is paltry compared with worldclass 
research centers 
but supporters say the institute would bring together the worlds 
top scientists to solve problems that matter to humanity 
everybody in the world would love to have an institute of this 
kind robert h smith chairman of the institutes board said 
monday 
plans for the institute which is to focus on research into 
communications and the environment were announced sunday during 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachevs visit to the twin cities 
british publisher robert maxwell has pledged 50 million if state 
officials raise a matching amount 
gov rudy perpich said monday an initial 1 million donation from 
dwayne andreas chairman of archer daniels midland co boosted the 
states effort to match maxwells pledge 
smith said its premature to set specific goals for the institute 
you cant do the last part first said smith vice chairman 
of st paul basedmaxwell communications north america the nations 
secondlargest printer now that theres actually life and theres 
blood flowing and theres excitement its on to that task 
perpich who at times has been criticized for dabbling in foreign 
affairs is credited with lobbying maxwell to fund the institute 
gorbachevs visit to minnesota at perpichs invitation provided the 
momentum for the project 
perpich on sunday compared the project with california institute 
of technology and massachusetts institute of technology 
but officials of those schools said monday they see big 
differences between their institutions and the gorbachev maxwell 
institute which would depend entirely on private funding and would 
not award degrees 
that would be a sharp departure from mit where teaching and 
research are both very important said robert c diiorio 
associate director of the mit news office i think it would be 
apples and oranges 
mit scientists conducted research projects valued at 2857 
million in fiscal 1989 diiorio said and the schools endowment as 
of june 30 1989 was 125 billion 
caltech spokesman robert finn said the project might be difficult 
to get off the ground but predicted it had a fair chance of success 
gorby tech is going to have certain advantages scientists 
would be free of teaching responsibilities and thats attractive to 
many people there may be freedom from one of the things that 
scientists hate most grant applications he said 
finn said caltechs 1989 budget for education and general 
expenditures was nearly 181 million not including a billiondollar 
budget for a separate jet propulsion laboratory funded primarily by 
nasa and the department of defense 
finn said the twin cities institute would likely have more 
success if it focused on specific goals and the environment and 
communications might be good choices 
environmental research is not one of the most heavily funded 
areas of science these days he said scientists in those 
specific fields might be interested 
smith said the 100 million would be raised by the end of 1991 
but said there is no date projected to open the institute

citicorp said it will stop underwriting 
distribution and trading of municipal securities cutting 35 jobs in 
another sign of wall streets slowdown 
glen sergeon managing director of citicorp securities markets 
inc said monday the municipal finance division would cut about 
half of its 70 jobs but is trying to find jobs for displaced workers 
in other areas of the big bank holding company 
we are having an honest react to current market conditions 
he said the marketplace has a lot of excess capacity in it that 
isnt going away quickly 
sergeon said citicorp would concentrate on creating and offering 
derivative products in municipal finance rather than underwriting 
such products typically allow issuers to hedge interest rate and 
other risks 
citicorp is the latest of major underwriters to scale back its 
business in the municipal bond field because of a slowdown in 
issuing taxexempt securities stemming mainly from the tax reform 
act of 1986 
sergeon said the market peaked in 1986 when 320 billion in 
municipal bonds were issued and underwriters received 11 a bond in 
1989 the total number of issues was 118 billion and underwriters 
made 7 a bond 
the amount of human and capital capacity dedicated to this 
marketplace has not adjusted commensurate to the size of the 
market he said 
citicorp said the cuts will not affect other services to 
municipal bond issuers such as investment agreements shorterterm 
distribution agreements and various credit services
